preface 



a portion of the following pages has already 
appeared in two articles contributed by the author 
to the north british review the present work 
is an attempt to exhibit more fully the relations 
there intimated as existing between logic and 
psychology with some additional matters which 
could not be included within the limits of a review 
the title of the work is not meant to imply that 
it contains an introduction to logic or is designed 
for the use of those unacquainted with its rudi 
ments on the contrary without some previous 
knowledge of the elementary portion of that 
science the greater part of the present volume 
will not be intelligible but it is intended as an 
inquiry into that which in the order of nature is 
prior to logic though in the order of time it is 
of later scientific development and in the order 
of study should be postponed till after an ac 
quaintance at least with the elements of logical 

n no art philosophy of language no art recent 
extensions of formal logic 

a 



iv preface 

science — an inquiry into a subject which is in 
dicated by every page of logic in which mind 
and its operations are mentioned and which is 
the touchstone by which the whole truth and 
scientific value of logic must ultimately be 
tested — an inquiry into the constitution and laws 
of the thinking faculty such as they are assumed 
by the logician as the basis of his deductions 
it may therefore be regarded as an attempt to 
prosecute in relation to logic the inquiry in 
stituted by the prolegomena of kant in relation 
to metaphysics namely what are the psycho 
logical conditions under which a scientific system 
is possible and what in conformity to those 
conditions are the characteristic features which 
such a system must exhibit it is not intended 
as a complete treatise either on psychology 
alone or on logic alone but as an exposition 
of psychology in relation to logic containing 
such portions of the former as are absolutely 
necessary to the vindication and even to the 
understanding of the latter 

that something of the kind is not altogether 
unneeded will be acknowledged by those who are 
acquainted with the literature of the subject 
during the last and present century under the 
influence of the critical philosophy of kant 
formal logic in itself and in its relations to 
psychology has been elaborated by numbers of 
eminent writers in germany from whose labours 



preface v 

the english student has as yet derived hardly 
any benefit misconceptions are still allowed to 
prevail concerning the nature and office of logic 
which the slightest acquaintance with the actual 
constitution of human thought and its laws would 
suffice to dissipate for ever matters treated of 
by different logicians are alternately expelled from 
and restored to the province of the science with 
out the appearance of any thing like a sound 
canon of criticism to determine what is logical 
and what is not attack and defence of the 
study have been conducted on grounds equally 
untenable and a conception of logic as it might 
 be were the human mind constituted as it is not 
is frequently tossed to and fro between contending 
parties to the exclusion of logic as it must be 
while the human mind is constituted as it is 

but if an exposition of psychology in relation 
to logic is thus needed for a distinct conception 
of the latter science in itself it is not less needed 
when we look to the conditions under which 
that science may be most profitably employed 
as a branch of academical study few who are 
acquainted with the various logical systems of 
modern times will hesitate to give a decided 
preference over all others to the formal view of 
the science which from the days of kant has 
gradually been advancing to perfection whether 
we regard the unity and scientific completeness 
of the system itself the great names by which 



vi preface 

it is supported the valuable works that might 
easily be made available for its communication 
or the facility with which it might be introduced 
into the existing course of study in all it pos 
sesses unquestionable advantages as the basis of 
logical instruction but on the other hand its 
compass is small and its contents though clear 
and definite are taken by themselves too meagre 
to be an adequate substitute for the miscellaneous 
reading which is so often misnamed logical to 
supply this defect two courses are open the 
study of formal logic may be combined either 
with its objective or with its subjective applications 
we may treat that is to say a system of logic 
either in connection with some of the various objects 
of thought to which it may in practice be applied 
or in relation to the thinking mind and to that 
mental philosophy of which it forms a portion 
the former method has been abundantly tried and 
has abundantly failed in the trial a system of 
logic treated in its objective application has no 
alternative between an impossible universality or 
an arbitrary exclusiveness by whatever right 
one iota of the matter of thought can claim ad 
mission into the system by the same right the 
whole universe of human knowledge is entitled to 
follow such a method can only be employed as 
a bad means of collecting desultory information on 
unconnected subjects as a system it postulates 
its own failure 



preface vll 

it is in connection not in confusion with 
cognate sciences as a branch of mental philosophy 
that logic may and ought to be studied one of 
the objects of the present work is to shew that 
logic as a science cannot be rightly understood 
and appreciated except in relation to psychology 
the negtect of this relation has been acknowledged 
as the weak side of the kantian philosophy b its 
recognition has been imperatively demanded by 
the ablest modern writers on the subject selon

parole v the propriety of including these psy 
chological matters in a treatise on logic may be 
questioned but to the necessity of including them 
in a philosophical course of which logic should 
form a portion the whole history of the science 
bears witness the alliance established of old 
between logic and metaphysics was dissolved by 
the critical philosophy of kant and cannot be 
restored except by identifying the two with hegel

made in philosophical study which can only be 
adequately supplied by a wellconnected course of 
mental science embracing as its constituent por 
tions the three cognate subjects of logic ethics 
and psychology 

to ethics as well as to logic psychology is an 
indispensable supplement the science f man as 
he ought to be must be based on that of man as 
he is in moral philosophy as in logic questions 
of a psychological character meet us at every stage 
of our course and the value of every ethical 
system must ultimately be tested on psychological 
grounds perhaps it is not too much to say 
that half the ethical systems which have been at 
different times in vogue have started from a psy 
chological assumption which consistently carried 
out would make ethical philosophy impossible 

mqy it be allowed to suggest a still higher 
application of the same criterion in the very 
conception of revealed religion as a commu 
nication from an infinite to a finite intelligence 
is implied the existence of certain ideas of a purely 
negative character the purpose of which is not 
speculative but regulative truth which are de 
signed not to satisfy our reason but to guide our 
practice these from their very nature are beyond 
the criticism of reason but in order to discri 
minate accurately between the provinces of reason 
and faith to determine what we may and what we 
may not seek to comprehend as a speculative 



preface ix 

truth an examination of the limits of mans mental 
powers is indispensable the ground of many a 
controversy might be considerably narrowed were 
we to inquire at the outset what are the mental 
powers that can be brought to the solution of the 
question and how are they related to the data on 
which they must operate fichte made his earliest 
attempt as a disciple of the kantian philosophy 
by an essay towards a critique of every revelation 
the positive portion of his principles of criticism 
for many of them have a negative character only 
might be better applied to a critique of every 
critique of revelation — an inquiry that is to 
say what portion of the contents of revelation 
as addressed to human minds can be wrought by 
human interpretation into the form of speculative 
dogmas 

 la psychologie says m cousin nest as 
surement pas toute la philosophie mais elle en est 
le fondement if there be any truth in this saying 
of one of the highest philosophical authorities of 
our own or of any age it will follow of necessity 
that a course of instruction in this fundamental 
branch must be an integral and indispensable 
portion of any system of philosophical teaching 

the psychological criticisms of the present work 
are mainly limited to logical questions and are 
designed to throw some light on matters which 
almost from the commencement of my logical 
studies have appeared to me to stand in especial 



x preface 

need of elucidation much of what has been 
acquired from foreign sources with much labour 
and little guidance in the search might have been 
learned in an easier and more direct manner had 
the course which i have ventured to recommend 
been adopted in relation to my own early studies 
the numerous obligations which the work is under 
to previous writers are most of them acknow 
ledged as they occur one or two however 
demand an express mention here the reader 
who is familiar with kants writings will probably 
discern obligations to the critical philosophy in 
almost every page even where the language of 
kant has been departed from and the difference 
in detail is such as would not justify a direct refer 
ence to his works the method and material for 
thinking derived from the study of the kantian 
philosophy is in many respects far more valuable 
than the direct information communicated this 
is especially the case with a student who views 
that philosophy from the psychological rather 
than the metaphysical side in its relation to 
hume and locke rather than to wolf and leib 
nitz and who endeavours to combine the materials 
thence obtained with the most valuable results of 
the scottish philosophy which owes its rise like 
the kantian to the scepticism of hume 

to two other eminent philosophers a similar 
acknowledgment is due the german side of 
m cousins eclecticism approaches in aim at 



preface xi 

least if not in method nearer to the philosophy 
of schelling and hegel than to that of kant 
it is natural therefore that his view of the limits 
of human thought and consequently of the pro 
vince of logic and of its relation to psychology 
should contain much which cannot be directly 
transferred to the pages of a work which advocates 
a strictly formal view of logic and which would 
rather contract than enlarge the limits assigned by 
kant to the understanding and the reason but 
the writings of m cousin are indispensable to all 
who would gain a true estimate of the importance 
of psychology and its position in a philosophical 
course and the benefits which i am conscious of 
having derived from their study are far more than 
can be adequately expressed by a direct acknow 
ledgment of passages borrowed from them from 
the authors view of the office of logic i have 
departed widely which makes it the more neces 
sary to confess the numberless advantages derived 
from his writings in relation to almost every point 
treated of in the following pages 
 in many points in which i have departed from 
the doctrines of the great eclectic i am much 
indebted to the writings of his illustrious critic 
sir william hamilton the same acknowledg 
ment may indeed be made in relation to nearly 
the whole contents of the present volume partly 
by way of direct obligation and still more by way 
of hints and suggestions of questions to be solved 



xii preface 

and the method of their solution i cannot indeed 
claim the sanction of this eminent authority for 
any statement which is here advanced except 
where direct reference is made to his writings 
yet probably even where i have differed from 
him in opinion there is much that would never 
have been written at all but for the valuable aid 
furnished by him to say that i have occasionally 
ventured to dissent from the positions of each and 
all of the philosophers to whom i am so much 
indebted is only to say that i have endeavoured 
to study their works in the spirit in which they 
themselves would wish to be studied with the 
respect and gratitude of a disciple but it is hoped 
without the servility of a copyist 

for the phraseology which i have occasionally 
been compelled to employ in the course of the 
following remarks no apology will be required 
by those acquainted with the history of mental 
science in no branch of study is it so necessary 
to observe the aristotelian precept ovofiarotrouiv 
rapv€las €p€k€v nine tenths of the confusion 
and controversy that have existed in this departs 
ment are owing to that unwillingness to innovate 
in matters of language which leads to the employ 
ment of the same term in various shades of 
meaning and with reference to various phenomena 
of consciousness in this respect philosophy is 
under deep obligations to the purism of german 
writers which has enabled subsequent thinkers to 



preface xu 



examine the most important problems of psycho 
logy apart from the old associations of language 
a new phraseology may occasion some little dif 
ficulty at the outset of a work but to adhere to 
an inadequate vocabulary merely because its ex 
pressions are established is to involve the whole 
of the subject in hopeless confusion and obscurity 
in this respect however i trust i shall not be 
found to have departed from authorized language 
in a greater degree than is absolutely necessary 
for the purpose of communicating to english 
readers some of the most valuable results of 
german thought and of carrying into effect the 
main design of the present essay — that of testing 
the received processes of logic by reference to 
the facts of human consciousness

on thought as distinguished from other facts of 
consciousness 

without entering into the countless disputes 
which have taken place concerning the nature and 
definition of logic it is sufficient to observe that 
it will be treated in the following pages in accord 
ance principally with the views of kant as the 
science of the laws of formal thinking in the 
wide sense indeed in which the term is used by 
archbishop whately it may be admitted that 
logic as furnishing rules to secure the mind from 
error in its deductions is also an art or to speak 
more correctly a practical science still it may

be questioned whether the practical service thus 
performed by logic can with propriety be allowed 
to influence its definition the benefits performed 
by logic as a medicine of the mind however highly 
we may be disposed to rate them are accidental 
only and arise from causes external to the science 
itself its speculative character as an inquiry into 
the laws of thought is internal and essential to 
the twofold character of logic two conditions are 
necessary firstly that there exist certain mental 
laws to which every sound thinker is bound to 
conform secondly that it is possible to trans 
gress those laws or to think unsoundly on the 
former of these conditions depends the possi 
bility of logic as a speculative science on the 
latter its possibility as a practical science or art 
now if we look at these two conditions with refer 
ence to the actual contents of pure logic it is 
manifest that the abrogation of the first would 
utterly annihilate the whole science whereas the 
abrogation of the second would at most only neces 
sitate the removal of a few excrescences leaving 
the main body of logical doctrine substantially as 
it is at present suppose for example that the 
difference between sound and unsound reasoning

could be discerned in individual cases as a matter 
of fact but that we had no power of classifying 
the several instances of each and referring them 
to certain common principles it is clear that 
under such a supposition the present contents of 
logic speculative and practical could have no 
existence the number of sound and unsound 
thinkers in the world might remain much as it is 
now but the impossibility of investigating the prin 
ciples of the one and applying them to the correc 
tion of the other would make an art or science 
of logic unattainable but let us imagine on the 
other hand a race of intelligent beings subject to 
the same laws of thought as mankind but inca 
pable of transgressing them in practice the 
elements of existing logic the concept the judg 
ment the syllogism would remain unaltered the 
science of logic would investigate the laws of 
unerring reason as the science of astronomy 
investigates the unvarying laws of the heavenly 
phenomena but an art of logic to preserve the 
mind from error would be as absurd as an art of 
astronomy proposing to control and regulate the 
planets in their courses from these consider 
ations it follows that even granting logic to be 
under existing circumstances both science and 
art yet the former is an essential the latter an 
accidental feature the one is necessarily inter 
woven with the elements of the system the other 
a contingent result of the infirmities of those who 

b 



 prolegomena logic a 

possess it in this respect pure logic may not 
unfairly be compared to mechanics treated as a 
branch of mathematics as sciences both proceed 
deductively from assumptions more or less incon 
sistent with the actual state of things as arts 
neither can be put in practice without making 
allowance for contingencies neglected in the scien 
tific theory the assumed logical perfection of 
thought bears about the same relation to the 
ordinary state of the human mind as the assump 
tion of perfectly rigid levers and perfectly flexible 
cords bears to the actual condition of those instru 
ments in practice but on the other hand the 
possibility of making such allowances implies that 
the difference between practice and theory is one 
of degree only and not of kind the instrument 
as used may not be identical with the instrument 
as contemplated but it must be supposed capable 
of approximation to it a science of the laws of 
thought is only valuable in so far as its laws are 
acknowledged to be those to which actual thinking 
ought as far as possible to conform and which 
if fully complied with would represent only the 
better performance of existing obligations not the 
imposition of new ones the same may be said 
of ethical philosophy likewise in describing the 
perfection of moral and intellectual virtue we 
describe a standard to which in the existing state 
of human nature no man does or can attain but 
the whole value of the portrait is derived from its 



prolegomena looica 

being a more or less accurate representation of 
man as he ought to be not the imaginary sketch 
of a being of a totally distinct kind 

in order therefore to the right appreciation of 
any given system of logic it becomes necessary to 
ask what is the actual nature of thought as an 
operation to what laws is it subject and to what 
extent are they efficient this inquiry does not 
strictly speaking fall within the province of logic 
itself no science is competent to criticise its 
own principles that there is such an operation 
as thinking and certain laws to which it is bound 
to conform the logician does not question but 
assumes whether there are other mental ope 
rations besides thinking and whether these must 
act in combination with thought for the attain 
ment of any special class of truths — these and 
such like questions it is beyond his province to 
investigate his own branch of inquiry is twofold 
partly constructive and partly critical in the 
former capacity he inquires what are the several 
forms legitimate or illegitimate which thought as 
a product will assume according as the act of 
thinking is or is not conducted in conformity to

o prolegomena logica 

its given laws in the latter capacity he sifts 
and examines the special products of this or that 
thinker and pronounces them according to the 
features which they exhibit to be legitimately 
produced or otherwise d 

beyond the boundaries of pure logic there is 
thus another and important field of inquiry is 
the mind capable of other operations besides those 
of thought and are there other kinds of mental 
rectitude besides that which results from the con 
formity of thought to its own laws do the 
several mental faculties act in the pursuit of truth 
conjointly or separately does each process 
guarantee the complete attainment of a limited 
class of truths or the attainment of a single 
element which becomes truth only in combina 
tion do the laws of thought as assumed by 
logic exhibit those features which from the 
general constitution of the human mind and the 
peculiar character of the thinking faculty they 
might be expected to exhibit in relation to 
these and similar questions logic is subordinate 
to psychology 

to psychology we must look for the explanation 
and justification of the peculiar features of logic 
logic says one antagonist furnishes no criterion 
of material truth and falsehood it may be that 
from the constitution of the human mind such a 

d see clauberg logica proleg §• viii drobisch neue 
darstellung der logik § fries system der logik §• 



prolegomena logica 

criterion is impossible its principles says another 
are mere frivolous tautologies it may be that 
this very tautology has a psychological significance 
that it is the necessary consequence of a mind 
gazing upon its own laws it is barren in the 
production of positive science it may be that 
thought alone was never designed by mans maker 
to be otherwise as an instrument it has at 
tempted much and accomplished little the fault 
may lie not in the tool but in the workman 
before we condemn logic for what it does not 
perform or despise it for what it does it may be 
as well to ask what we may learn elsewhere of the 
nature of the thinking faculty and what it may 
reasonably be expected to accomplish 

in order therefore to determine accurately 
the province and capabilities of logic it will be 
necessary to examine the psychological distinction 
between thought properly so called and other 
phenomena of mind this being ascertained there 
will remain the inquiry in what manner our con 
sciousness itself and the several objects submitted 
to it may be regarded as subject to law what 
are the different classes of laws whether of the 
subject or of the object the characteristic features 
of each their mode of determining the several 
operations subject to them and the consequent 
character of the respective products 

every state of consciousness necessarily implies 
two elements at least a conscious subject and an 



 prolegomena logca 

object of which he is conscious in every exercise 
for example of the senses we may distinguish the 
object seen heard smelt touched tasted from 
the subject seeing hearing smelling touching 
tasting in every emotion of pleasure or of pain 
there is a certain affection agreeable or dis 
agreeable existing within me and of this affection 
i am conscious in every act of volition there 
takes place a certain exercise of my will and i am 
conscious that it takes place in this point of 
view it is not necessary to enter on the often 
disputed question whether such states of conscious 
ness furnish immediate evidence of the existence 
of a world external to ourselves that of which 
i am directly conscious may be an object nu 
merically distinct from myself or it may be a 
modification of ray own mind all that need be 
insisted upon here is that there is present an 
individual object whether thing act or state of 
mind and that we are conscious of such an object 
as existing within or without ourselves a psycho 
logical dualism is implied in the very notion of 
consciousness whether this necessarily involves 
an ontological dualism it is beyond our present 
purpose to inquire 

 this point has been already argued fully and satisfactorily 
by the great modern advocate of natural dualism sir william 
hamilton the reader is referred to his edition of reids 
works especially to his notes b and g for a masterly dis 
sertation on this important question 



prolegomena logic a jj 

but to constitute an act of thought more is 
required than the immediate relation of subject to 
object in consciousness every one of the above 
states might exist in a mind totally incapable of 
thought let us suppose for example a being 
in whose mind every successive state of conscious 
ness was forgotten as soon as it had taken place 
every individual object might be presented to him 
precisely as it is to us animals men trees and 
stones might be successively placed before his 
eyes pleasure and pain and anger and fear 
might alternate within him but as each departed 
he would retain no knowledge that it had ever 
existed and consequently no power of comparison 
with similar or dissimilar objects of an earlier or 
later consciousness he would have no know 
ledge of such objects as referred to separate notions 
he could not say this which see is a man or a 
horse this which i feel is fear or anger he 
would be deficient in the distinctive feature of 
thought the concept or general notion resulting 
from the comparison of objects hence arises 
the important distinction between intuitions in 
which the object is immediately related to the 

r here and throughout the following pages the word 
intuition is used in the extent of the german anschauuny to 
include all the products of the perceptive external or internal 
and imaginative faculties every act of consciousness in short 
of which the immediate object is an individual thing act or 
state of mind presented under the condition of distinct exist 
ence in space or time 



 prolegomena logic a 

conscious mind and thoughts in which the object 
is mediately related through a concept gained by 
i comparison the former contains two elements 
only the subject and the object standing in 
present relation to each other the latter con 
tains three elements the thinking subject the 
object about which he thinks and the concept 
mediating between the two thus even the 
exercise of the senses upon present objects in 
the manner in which it is ordinarily performed by 
a man of mature faculties does not consist of 
mere intuition but is accompanied by an act of 
thought in mere intuition all that is simul 
taneously presented to the sense appears as one 
whole but mere intuition does not distinguish 

 the revival of this term unfortunately till very recently 
suffered to grow obsolete in philosophy will need no apology 
with those who are acquainted with the writings of sir w 
hamilton it is absolutely necessary to distinguish in lan 
guage between the act of thought and its product a distinction 
expressed in greek by vrjais and vrpa and in the following 
remarks by conception and concept the latter term has been 
folly sanctioned by the usage of french philosophers as well 
as of the eminent writer above mentioned 

h in apprehending an individual thing either itself through 
sense or its representation in the phantasy we have in a 
certain sort an absolute or irrespective cognition which is 
justly denominated immediate by contrast to the more relative 
and mediate knowledge which subsequently we compass of 
the same object when by a comparative act of the under 
standing we refer it to a class that is think or recognise it

its several parts from each other under this or that 
notion i may see at once in a single panorama 
a ship upon the sea an island lying behind it 
and the sky above it to mere intuition this is 
presented only in confusion as a single object 
to distinguish its constituent portions as sea 
and land ship and sky requires a comparison 
and classification of them relatively to so many 
separate concepts existing in the mind and such 
classification is an act of thought 

in every act of consciousness the ultimate 
object is an individual but in intuition this 
object is presented to the mind directly and does 
not imply the existence past or present of any 
thing but itself and the mind to which it is pre 
sented in thought on the other hand the indi 
vidual is represented by means of a concept which 
contains certain attributes applicable to other indi 
viduals of the same kind j this implies that there 
have been presented to the mind prior objects of 
intuition originating the concept or general notion

to which subsequent objects are referred hence 
arises another important distinction all intuition 
is direct and presentative all thought is indirect 
and representative 

this distinction necessitates a further remark 
on the characteristic feature of thought as com 
pared with one special class of intuitions that 
sensitive perception takes place through the me 
dium of a representative idea is a hypothesis 
which was made more than questionable by the 
philosophy of reid and may be regarded as com 
pletely overthrown by the recent labours of his 
illustrious editor sir william hamilton but 
there still remains the faculty of imagination 
whose office is the production of images repre 
sentative of the several phenomena of perception k 

k the term perception requires a few words in explanation 
in modern philosophy from descartes to reid this term 
was used widely as coextensive with apprehension or con 
sciousness in general with some minor modifications for an 
account of which the reader is referred to sir w hamiltons 
reid p ft by reid and his followers it was used for 
the consciousness of an external object presented to the 
mind through the organs of sense as distinguished from 
sensation the consciousness of an affection of the subject 
through the same organs in this sense they are clearly 
distinguished by m royer coliard jouffroys reid iii p

internal as well as external in relation to this 
faculty the criterion above given as characteristic 
of thought requires a few words of explanation 

imagination regarded as a product may be 
defined the consciousness of an image in the 
mind resembling and representing an object of 

sensations only touch is in every case an union of sensation 
and perception while sight holds an intermediate and doubtful 
position as informing us of the existence of extension but 
only in two dimensions of space sir w hamilton on the 
other hand holds that the general consciousness of the 
locality of a sensorial affection ought to be regarded as a 
perception proper and in accordance with this view he has 
announced the important law that sensation and perception 
though always coexistent are as regards their intensity 
always in an inverse ratio to each other some recent french 
philosophers influenced by the union of physiological with 
psychological researches have employed the term perception 
in another sense to denote sensation with consciousness 
sensation being extended to those affections of the nervous 
organism of which we are not conscious this occurs in the 
writings of maine de biran and appears to have misled 
m ravaisson into imagining that that philosopher had anti 
cipated the abovementioned law of sir w hamilton the 
passage alluded to is apparently one in the essai sur la de 
composition de la pensee p but the resemblance is 
merely verbal a nearer anticipation may perhaps be found 
in kant anthropologic § 

in the text perception is employed to denote all those 
states of consciousness which are presentative only not 
representative it will thus include all intuitions except 
those of imagination and may be divided into external or 
sensitive and internal the former corresponding to the per 
ception of eeid this use of the term allowance being made 
for a different theory of external perception accords with 
that of kant

intuition it is thus at the same time preventative 
and representative it is presentative of the image 
which has its own distinct existence in conscious 
ness irrespective of its relation to the object which 
it is supposed to represent it is representative of 
the object which that image resembles and such 
resemblance is only possible on the condition that 
the image be like the object individual if we 
try to form in our minds the image of a triangle 
it must be of some individual figure equilateral 
isosceles or scalene it is impossible that it should 
be at the same time all of these or none it may 
bear more or less resemblance to the object which 
it represents but it can attain resemblance at all 

 this is the ordinary psychological sense of imagination 
however variously the term may have been employed in 
reference to poetry and generally to the philosophy of taste 
it corresponds with the definition given by descartes 
meditatio secunda imaginari nihil aliud est quam rei corporea 
figuram sen imaginem contemplari except that the latter is 
incorrectly limited to the reproduction of objects of sight 
only the beautiful lines of shelley furnish an exact de

be determined by the answer to this question as every 
original presentation may be represented in a phantasm

vancing without the aid of symbols beyond the 
individual objects of sense or imagination in the 
presence of several individuals of the same species 
the eye may observe points of similarity between 
them and in this no symbol is needed but every 
feature thus observed is the distinct attribute of a 
distinct individual and however similar cannot be 
regarded as identical for example i see lying 
on the table before me a number of shillings of 
the same coinage examined severally the image 
and superscription of each is undistinguishable from 
that of its fellow but in viewing them side by 
side space is a necessary condition of my percep

make them distinct though similar individuals n 
the same is the case with any representative 
image whether in a mirror in a painting or in the 
imagination waking or dreaming it can only be 
depicted as occupying a certain place and thus 
as an individual and the representative of an indi 
vidual it is true that i cannot say that it repre 
sents this particular coin rather than that and 
consequently it may be considered as the repre 
sentative of all successively but not simultaneously 
to find a representative which shall embrace all 
at once i must divest it of the condition of occu

pying space and this experience assures us can 
only be done by means of symbols verbal or other 
by which the concept is fixed in the understand 
ing such for example is a verbal description of 
the coin in question which contains a collection 
of attributes freed from the condition of locality 
and hence from all resemblance to an object of 
sense if we substitute time for space the same 
remarks will be equally applicable to the objects of 
our internal consciousness every appetite and 
desire every affection and volition as presented is 
an individual state of consciousness distinguished 
from every other by its relation to a different 
period of time states in other respects exactly 
similar may succeed one another at regular inter 
vals but the hunger which i feel today is an 
individual feeling as numerically distinct from that 
which i felt yesterday or that which i shall feel 
tomorrow as a shilling lying in my pocket is fr§m 
a similar shilling lying at the bank whereas my 
notion of hunger or fear or volition is a general 
concept having no relation to one period of time 
rather than to auother and as such requires like 
other concepts a representative sign 

language taking the word in its widest sense 
is thus indispensable not merely to the commu

relative or consequent of that which derives all 
knowledge from sensation an estimate apparently 
warranted by the association of the two theories 
in the philosophy of condillac but it would not 
be difficult to shew that the ultrasensational 
philosophy is that which could most easily dis 
pense with the necessity of introducing language 
at all ideas says condillac are but transformed 
sensations and his chsciple destutt de tracy 
has carried the doctrine to its fullest development 
in the aphorism penser cel sentir but who ima 
gines language to be essential to sensation or 
who does not see that the introduction of such 
an instrument for the purpose of transforming 
our sensations implies the existence of a mental 
power which mere sensation can never confer 
it is only onythe supposition that the concept is 
something instinct from and unlike all the pro 
ducts of the senses that the representative symbol 
becomes necessary sensation imagination and 
memory so far as the latter is distinct from 
thought may dispense with its assistance as 
for the crowning extravagance of home tooke

mind are merely operations of language we have 
only to ask what makes language operate it 
might as reasonably be maintained that a coat is 
not the work of the tailor but merely of his 
needle but it is the perpetual error of the sensa

dition of a thing with the thing itself thought

the above view of the relation of thought to 
language is sometimes met by the following 
dilemma language you say is essential to 
thought yet language itself if not of divine 
origin must have been thought out by man 
you must therefore be prepared to defend in its 
utmost rigour the hypothesis of a supernatural 
origin of speech or you must allow that its 
inventor at least was a man capable of thinking 
without its aid q to solve this dilemma we need

the case of the deaf and dumb so often quoted as 
an instance of thought without language is in this 
respect utterly irrelevant the education of these 
persons consists in the substitution of a system of 
signs addressed to the eye or the hand in the place 
of one addressed to the ear this system performs 
precisely the same office in relation to them that 
speech performs in the ordinary mental develop

much accidental

to the same data it is true that the concept itself 
as such cannot be presented intuitively but it must 
contain no attribute which is incompatible with the 
intuitive presentation of its object the concept 
is not itself individual but it must comprehend 
such attributes as are capable of individualisation 
such as can coexist in an object of intuition the 
notion of a triangle as a rectilinear figure of three 
sides does not itself contain the attributes of 
equilateral isosceles or scalene but it is capable 
of being combined with any one of the three in a 
perceived or imagined figure but a rectilinear

square or a bilinear jigure is as a form of speech 
quite as possible as a straight line or an equilateral

not indicate the possibility or impossibility of the 
corresponding notion until we attempt to construct 
in imagination an individual object in accordance

conception is rather a substitute for consciousness 
than a mode of consciousness itself the sign is 
substituted for the thing signified a step which 
considerably facilitates the performance of complex 
operations of thought but in the same proportion 
endangers the logical accuracy of each successive 
step since we do not in each stop to verify our 
signs words as thus employed resemble alge

long calculation we combine in various relations 
to each other without at the moment thinking of 
the original signfication assigned to each but 
those who on this account would reduce the 
whole of thought to an algebraical computation 
overlook the most important feature the verifi

logical conditions of conception after the alge 
braical process is finished it may be convenient 
in the course of a complicated reasoning to assume 
the logical accuracy of the subordinate parts and 
to employ their respective symbols on this as

tion it bears to the particulars signified or repre 
sented by it by virtue whereof it is that things 
names or notions being in their own nature 
particular are rendered universal thus when i 
demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles 
it is to be supposed that i have in view the universal 
idea of a triangle which ought not to be understood 
as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which was 
neither equilateral nor scalenon nor equicrural 
but only that the particular triangle i consider 
whether of this or that sort it matters not doth 
equally stand for and represent all rectilinear tri 
angles whatever and is in that sense universal 
though the idea i have in view whilst i make the 
demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles 
rectangular triangle whose sides are of a deter 
minate length i may nevertheless be certain it 
extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what 
sort or bigness soever and that because neither 
the right angle nor the equality nor determinate 
length of the sides are at all concerned in the 
demonstration it is true the diagram i have in 
view includes all these particulars but then there 
is not the least mention made of them in the proof 

of the proposition and here it must be 

acknowledged that a man may consider a figure 
merely as triangular without attending to the 
particular qualities of the angles or relations of 
the sides so far he may abstract but this will 
never prove that he can frame an abstract general

inconsistent idea of a triangle on the other 
hand it was argued by reid that if a man may 
consider a figure simply as triangular without 
attending to the particular qualities of the angles 
or relations of the sides he must have some con 
ception of this object of his consideration for no 
man can consider a thing which he does not 
conceive he has a conception therefore of a 
triangular figure merely as such and this is all 
that is meant by an abstract general conception of 
a triangle 

in this controversy the question has been need 
lessly confused by the vague and inaccurate use of 
terms idea has been indifferently employed by 
modern philosophers to denote the object of 
thought of imagination and even under the re 
presentative hypothesis of perception k concep 
tion again has not been sufficiently distinguished 
on the one side from imagination and on the 
other from a mere understanding of the meaning 
of words and too little attention has been paid 
to the office of language both as a substitute for

indifferently applicable to any object of internal conscious 
ness i have in the present work occasionally availed myself

avoided wherever it is necessary to distinguish between two

consciousness and as contributing to the distinct 
ness of consciousness itself it is not strictly 
correct to say that the individual alone is perceived 
first and the general notion formed from it by 
abstraction for without the assistance of the 
general notion the individuals themselves and 
their several parts could not be distinguished from 
each other if i am to form a general notion of 
man by examining the individuals peter james 
and john and separating the accidents in which 
they differ from the essential points in which they 
agree it is clear that i must previously have 
formed general notions of the parts thus separated 
from each other in order to separate by an act 
of thought the figure common to a number of 
men from the accidents of stature complexion c 
peculiar to each i must first be able to form 
distinct notions of the human figure on the one 
side and of the several statures complexions c 
on the other abstraction thus presupposes con 
ception no less than conception presupposes 
abstraction and we have still to learn how either 
process can be a preliminary condition to the other 
the fact is that our earliest consciousness is 
neither of the individual discerned as an individual 
nor of the universal discerned as an universal but 
of a confused mixture of the two which it requires 
a further development of thought to analyse into 
the one or the other whatever we perceive

occupies a definite position in time and space it 
is seen now and here so far it is an individual 
but position in time and space does not constitute 
a mark by which this individual can be distinguished 
from that i cannot by these relations alone 
determine whether the object seen now and here 
is or is not the same individual that was formerly 
seen elsewhere to discern the individual as such 
or the universal as such i must by an act of 
thought discern certain attributes as characteristic 
of one and certain others as common to many 
and this power of discernment is gradually im 
parted to each of us in practice by the use of 
language in which our earliest abstractions are 
given to us already made in this gradual form 
ation of distinct thought from confused intuition 
it may in one sense indeed be said that our know 
ledge of the class is prior to that of the individual 
for resemblances are noticed earlier than differ 
ences and the names distinctive of individuals 
are at first associated only with their general 
features €€ children says aristotle at first 
call all men father and all women mother but 
afterwards they distinguish one person from 
another by degrees the individual attributes 

m a contrary theory on this point is the source of most of 
the difficulties which rousseau professes to find in accounting 
for the origin of general language from the names given to 
individuals

are discerned and separated from the generic but 
in the first instance the name is applied to 
different objects before we have learned to analyse 
the growing powers of speech and thought to ask 
what we mean by each several use of this or that 
appellation and to correct and fix the signification 
of words at first used vaguely and obscurely 
such is the actual service performed by language 
in the education of mankind under the existing 
conditions of social intercourse what was the 
origin of language itself and how far the same 
description will apply to the mental development 
of the first man is matter rather of ingenious 
conjecture than of scientific explanation 

berkeley therefore was clearly right in denying 
the existence of any such process of abstraction 
as that described by locke the error of the 
latter consisted in regarding abstraction as a 
positive act of thought instead of the mere 
negation of thought abstraction is nothing more 
than nonattention to certain parts of an object 
we do not positively think of a triangle as neither 
equilateral isosceles nor scalene but we think of 
the figure as composed of three sides without 
asking the question whether those sides are equal 
or unequal but on the other hand berkeley 
in maintaining that all notions are in their own 
nature particular has overlooked the fact that 
thought and language as the instrument of 
thought is necessary to distinguish the particular 



prolegomena logica 

as particular no less than the universal as uni 
versal and that we are thus enabled partially in 
intuitive and wholly in symbolical cognition to 
discern generic attributes and to constitute them 
an object of conception without being conscious 
of the particulars by which they are accompanied 
berkeley is right in denying that we can imagine 
the universal entirely apart from the particular 
but owing to the vague signification of the word 
idea he seems to speak of imagination as if it were 
coextensive with conception in symbolical cog 
nition the latter process may be carried on apart 
from the former subject however as has been 
already observed to the condition of being tested 
as valid or invalid by the power of imagining a 
corresponding object this distinction has been 
clearly indicated by berkeley in another of his 
works and perhaps his whole discussion needs 
only a more exact distinction between the per 
ception of individuals in time and space and the 
recognition of them by their peculiar attributes to 
render it philosophically unexceptionable 

in speaking of imagination as the test of 
conception we do not accede to the ultra 
sensationalism of condillac nor even to the 
modified doctrine of laromigutere who derives 
from the senses the whole matter of our know 
ledge individualize your concepts does not mean 
sensationalize them unless the senses are the only

sources of presentation if i am immediately 
conscious for example of an exercise of will as 
an individual act taking place within me the 
phenomena of volition become a distinct class of 
presentations coordinate with not subordinate to 
those of the senses and capable like them of 
being represented by the imagination and thought

of emotions of joy or sorrow of anger or fear

manner must be considered as data for thought

certain individual acts performed by myself or by 
another i am immediately conscious of an idea of 
right or wrong i have again a distinct class of 
intuitions simple and undefinable the laws and 
common features of which may furnish matter of 
further reflection but the existence of which as 
individual facts is the indispensable condition of 
all moral speculation 

the possibility therefore of any branch of 
scientific inquiry depends upon the psychological 
question how many preventative faculties has man t 

p in speaking of the human mind as possessing a plurality 
of faculties it is perhaps hardly necessary to protest against the 
misinterpretation of this language as if it implied that these 
faculties were distinct and independent portions of the mind 
like the separate members of the body sir w hamilton 
lectures on metaphysics vol ii lect xx has shewn that the 
contrary opinion has been the one generally prevalent that 



prolegomena logica 

every such faculty may furnish distinct materials 
for thought physical science is possible if the 
senses present us with material phenomena whose 
relations and laws thought may investigate moral 
science is possible if we are presented with the 
feet of moral approbation and disapprobation of 
this or that action in itself and for its own sake 
and the question for thought to investigate is 
whence do these feelings arise and on what laws 
are they dependent iesthetical science is again 
possible as a distinct branch of inquiry if the 
emotions arising from the contemplation of beauty 
in the works of nature or of art can be shewn to 
be distinct from any communicated by their mere 
relation to the senses and metaphysics must 

the vast majority of philosophers have either openly asserted 
or silently assumed that the faculties of mind are nothing 
more than modes in which the simple indivisible principle of 
thought may act and exist as thus explained the term is 
unobjectionable it may be that in mental as in physical 
mechanics we know force only from its effects but the con 
sciousness of distinct effects will then form the real basis of 
psychology the faculties may then be retained as a con 
venient method of classification provided the language is 
properly explained and no more is attributed to them than 
is warranted by consciousness the same consciousness 
which tells me that seeing is distinct from hearing tells me 
also that volition is distinct from both and to speak of the 
faculty of will does not necessarily imply more than the con 
sciousness of a distinct class of mental phenomena no one 
but an advocate of the grossest materialism could understand 
such an expression as implying numerically distinct organs 
of mind as of body 



 prolegomena logic a 

submit to the same criterion rational cosmology 
and rational psychology are possible only if 
matter and mind as distinct from their several 
phenomena can be shewn to be in any way pre 
sented as the objects of an immediate intuition 

this distinction between the presentations of 
intuition and the representations of thought which 
is thus the key to all the most valuable appli 
cations of psychology is intimated with more or 
less accuracy in the writings of several modern 
philosophers the oftenquoted passage of locke 
in which the operations of thought are compared 
to the productions of art furnishes in this respect 
when understood in its proper latitude an unex 
ceptionable description of the respective provinces 
of the intuitive and discursive faculties u it is 
not in the power of the most exalted wit or en 
larged understanding by any quickness or variety 
of thought to invent or frame one new simple 
idea in the mind the dominion of man in this 
little world of his own understanding being much 
the same as it is in the great world of visible 
things wherein his power however managed by 
art and skill reaches no farther than to compound 
or divide the materials that are made to his hand 
but can do nothing towards the making the least 
particle of new matter or destroying one atom of 
what is already in being v the ideas of sensation 
and ideas of reflection of the same philosopher

however unfortunate may be the original choice 
of terms and however inconsistent their subsequent 
employment point correctly enough to the two 
great sources of external and internal intuition 
a further step in accuracy is gained in the im 
pressions and ideas of hume though the dis 
tinction loses most of its value in his hands by 
the absurd ground of distinction which he has laid 
down between them and by the unfortunate 
metaphor which declares every idea to be an 
image of an impression kant who took up

r reflection in consistency with etymology ought to have 
been limited to the operations of thought in which sense 
we can reflect upon sensible objects as upon all other things 
locke only escapes from reids criticism on this point by 
using reflection improperly as stewart has observed as 
synonymous with internal consciousness this use of the 
term however is not peculiar to locke see sir w hamiltons 
lectures on metaphysics vol i p vol ii p 

 according to hume ideas and impressions differ from 
each other only in their different degrees of force and vivacity 
and belief he defines as a lively idea associated with a 
present impression a doctrine which almost justifies the 
sarcastic application of beid it will follow that the idea of 
a lion is a lion of less strength and vivacity and hence may 
arise a very important question whether the idea of a hon 
may not tear in pieces and devour the ideas of sheep oxen 
and horses and even of men women and children

ing on the use of the term idea and exhibited this 
most important distinction with any degree of 
accuracy and precision it is one of the most 
valuable principles of the critical philosophy that 
y the understanding has no power of intuition a 
principle which does not however necessitate the 
adoption of the kantian division of the mental 
faculties nor even the determination of the 
question whether the mind possesses numerically 
distinct faculties at all it simply means that 
the act of thought cannot create its own object 
that being mediate and representative it requires 
to be based on an immediate and presentative fact 
of consciousness 

it cannot therefore be maintained that the senses 
are the sole criteria of truth and of reality unless 
we assume in defiance of all consciousness that 

 in this respect nothing can be more unfair than stewarts 
sneers at the obscurity and new technical language of kant 
the philosophical terms of english and french writers are 
derived from the same source and subject to the same varieties 
of application the purism of german writers has given to 
all subsequent thinkers the inestimable advantage of contem 
plating the same thoughts under a new phraseology and 
with new associations of etymology and metaphor an ad 
vantage which no one has appreciated more highly or ex 
plained more happily than stewart himself on another 
occasion as it is impossible to comply exactly with the 
precept of locke to judge of ideas in themselves their 
names being wholly laid aside the next best course is to 
examine them as far as possible through the medium of two 
independent languages

there exist no immediate mental phenomena but 
those communicated by sensation any one pre 
sentation is as true and as real as any other 
falsehood and unreality can only begin with 
thought the immediate judgment of present 
ation that i am at this moment conseious of a 
certain object is equally true as regards any class 
of presentations unreality in this case can only 
consist in the distinctness of one class of present 
ations from another which latter we have arbi 
trarily selected as the test of reality and falsehood 
in the assertion of the identity of distinct classes or 
of the distinctness of identical ones but such a 
selection or assertion involves an act of thought 
it is a judgment concerning intuitions as classified 
under certain concepts if i choose arbitrarily to 
select the senses as the sole test of reality the 
phantasms of imagination are so far unreal but 
their unreality implies no more than that they are 
not perceived by the senses if i say a centaur 
exists as an image in my mind therefore it exists 
in nature the assertion is false because by an act 
of thought i judge that to be an object of possible 
sense which is only given to me as an object of 
imagination its reality in relation to the latter 
faculty remains undisturbed 

this view of the reality of all presentations as 
such could not indeed be consistently held by the 
advocates of a representative theory of perception 
if in all intuition i am immediately conscious only 



 prolegomena logic a 

of certain ideas or modifications of my own mind 
i am reduced to the alternative either of disbelieving 
the existence of an external world altogether or 
of drawing a distinction between such ideas as are 
representative and indicate the existence of objects 
without my mind and such as are purely imaginary 
and have no objective reality corresponding the 
former will then be distinguished as real the latter 
as unreal presentations but if in perception i 
am immediately and presentatively conscious of a 
nonego and such is the soundest view both in 
common sense and in philosophy the repre 
sentative idea and its supposed claim to superior 
reality vanishes altogether every presentation 
is real in itself some as immediately informing me 
of the existence of states of my own mind others 
as immediately informing me of the existence of 
objects without and my judgment about each is 
equally true when i assert it to be what it is and 
equally false when i assert it to be what it is not 
in this respect the philosophers of the school of 
common sense have not always consistently adhered 
to their fundamental principle in the distinction 
which they have drawn between perception and 
imagination x

but though it is not true that the whole matter 
of knowledge is furnished by the senses it cannot 
be denied that it is entirely furnished by the pre 
tentative faculties and this may throw some light 
on a distinction concerning which there frequently 
exists considerable confusion the distinction be 
tween what are vaguely enough termed positive 
and negative ideas a positive intuition is one which 
has been presented to us in actual consciousness 
real or imaginary a positive concept is one whose 
component parts are capable of being so presented 
in combination a negative concept on the other 
hand which is in fact no concept at all is the 
attempt to realize in thought those combinations 
of attributes of which no corresponding intuition 
is possible the inability may be absolute or 
relative owing to the general limitations of all 
human consciousness or to peculiar deficiencies 
in the experience of this or that individual thus 
a blind man may be said to have a negative idea 
of colour when he attempts to supply the defects 
of his experience by analogy from other sensations 
as in the case mentioned by locke of the man 
who supposed the colour of scarlet to resemble 
the sound of a trumpet but in like manner any 
man though in the full possession of his faculties 
can only negatively conceive those simple ideas 

y essay y b iii ch § 

 by simple ideas are meant the immediate objects of 
sensation or reflection in lockes sense of the terms such as

which have never been actually presented in their 
proper intuition the nature of the presentation 
will of course depend upon the faculty to which 
that class of intuitions belongs if i have never 
seen objects of any other colour than white and 
red i have a positive idea of these a negative idea 
of blue and yellow if i had all my lifetime been 
subject to coercion and had never performed an 
act of volition i should have a negative idea of 
free agency if i had never in my life found my 
volition opposed i should have a negative idea of 
coercion as it is i have a positive idea of both 
i desire to thrust my arm out in open space and 
my desire is carried into effect here is the positive 
consciousness of freedom i try to thrust it through 
a wall and am resisted here is the positive con 
sciousness of coercion a when locke declared 



colour and sound which can be apprehended only by actual 
sight or hearing perception and volition which can be 
known only by the actual experience of selfconsciousness 
complex notions may be formed from these by an act of 
pure imagination but the elements must be given beforehand 
compare locke i c 

a some philosophers represent the idea of freedom as a 
negative one thus kant rechtlehre p £ ed schubert 
and fichte eritik alter offenbarung § describe it as merely 
an absence of the feeling of compulsion this description 
would be correct if we had never performed an act in our 
lives except under coercion as it is the idea of freedom is 
as positive as that of restraint both being at different times 
presented in actual consciousness the same is the case

infinite space and infinite duration to be negative 
ideas he was right if we grant his hypothesis of 
their origin the former he derived from sensation 
and all the space which we can actually perceive 
by the senses is finite the latter he derived from 
reflection and every duration which we have 
personally experienced is finite also those who 
do not accede to his conclusion ground their 
dissent on a denial of his premises the language 
in which the concept is expressed is in this respect 
altogether indifferent we may speak of the same 
act as voluntary or not constrained as compulsory 
or not voluntary the test of its positive or negative 
character is to be found in the question has it ever 
been realized in an intuitive presentation 

those ideas whose negative character depends 
merely on the deficiencies of individual experience 
and which may therefore be described as acci 
dentally or relatively negative are beyond the 
consideration of pure logic or pure metaphysics 
which deal only with those conditions of thought 
which are common to all mankind hence the 

traries each of which as a phenomenon of consciousness is 
as positive as the other what may be their respective 
relations to a transcendental cause beyond the sphere of 
consciousness we have no means of determining 

b see cousin hutoire de la philosophic lecon xviii on 
the other hand lockes conclusion is supported though on 
different grounds by sir w hamilton discussions p 
who shews that an absolutely first unit of space or time and 
an infinite extent of either are both equally inconceivable 



 prolegomena logica 

only negative ideas with which the logician or 
metaphysician as such is concerned are those 
which arise from an attempt to transcend the 
universal conditions of all human thought if the 
human mind is subject to laws and limitations 
which it is unable to transgress by any effort of 
thought and that this is the case will be shewn 
at a further stage of our inquiry there will arise 
in relation to these a class of notions which may 
be distinguished as essentially or absolutely negative 
such negative notions however must not be con 
founded with the absence of all mental activity 
they imply at once an attempt to think and a 
failure in that attempt the language by which 
such notions are indicated is not like a word in an 
unknown tongue which excites no corresponding 
affection in the mind of the hearer it indicates a 
relation if only of difference to that of which we 
are positively conscious and a consequent effort 
to pass from the one to the other thus if it be 
true that the infinite is not a positive object of 
human thought it will not follow that the word 
is to us wholly unmeaning we may attempt to 
separate the condition of finiteness from our con 
ception of a given object though the result may 
ultimately involve a selfcontradiction we may 
attempt in like manner to conceive a space enclosed 
by two straight lines and it is not till after the 
attempt has been made that we become aware that 
e see sir w hamiltons discussions p 



prolegomena logica 

the expression bilinear figure admits of no corre 
sponding notion and it may frequently happen 
owing to the use of language as a substitute for 
positive thought that a process of reasoning may 
be carried on to a considerable length without the 
reasoner being aware of the essentially incon 
ceivable character of the terms which he is em 
ploying if we assume without inquiry the 
possible existence of a circular square we may 
demonstrate of it in succession all the properties 
of the circle and all those of the square without at 
the moment perceiving their incompatibility with 
each other such a selfdeception is still easier 
when the negative character depends not on the 
union of attributes which cannot be conceived in 
conjunction but on the separation of those which 
cannot be conceived apart we may easily 
analyse in language that which it is impossible 
to analyse in thought thus we can neither 
perceive nor imagine colour without extension 
an unextended colour is therefore a purely 
negative notion yet many philosophers of emi 
nence have maintained that the connection between 
these two ideas is merely one of association and 
have reasoned concerning colour apart from ex 
tension with as much confidence as if their 
language represented a positive thought the 
speculations concerning the seat of the soul may 
be cited as another instance of the same kind 
position in space and occupation of space are

 prolegomena logica 

correlative notions neither is conceivable apart 
from the other yet the above speculations for 
the most part proceed on the tacit assumption that 
it is possible to assign a local habitation to an 
unextended substance such is the influence of 
language even when representing not thought 
but its negation 

if thought is operative only within the field of 
possible experience it follows that we are not 
entitled in any act of thought to add to the data 
given in the concept without a fresh appeal to 
intuition i have in my mind the notion of a 
centaur as a creature with the upper parts of a man 
and the lower parts of a horse but this concept 
does not in itself contain the attribute of existence 
in space as an object of possible perception i am 
therefore not warranted in thinking of the centaur 
as so existing until the attribute is supplied from 
its proper source of presentation which in this case 
is sensible experience if my notion of man does 
not contain the attribute of mortality i may think 
of man as mortal or as immortal but i cannot 
determine which of these judgments is true i e is 
in accordance with the corresponding intuition 
without comparing them with the fact as presented 
by experience in the mere notion of two straight 
lines it is not contained that they cannot inclose 
a space and in the mere notions of the numbers 
 and it is not contained that their sum is 
neither of these judgments therefore can be 



prolegomena logica 

determined to be true without an appeal to some 
fact or other of intuition this limitation of 
the province of thought implies some important 
consequences which will appear when we come to 
consider the character of the laws of pure thinking 
recognised by logic 

before taking leave of this part of our subject 
it may be useful to point out one or two question 
of controversy to which the distinction between 
thought and other facts of consciousness may be 
applied with advantage 

it has been remarked by sir william hamilton 
that the whole controversy of nominalism and 
conceptualism is founded on the ambiguity of the 
terms employed on the want that is of an accurate 
distinction such as is furnished by the german 
anschauung and begriff between the individual 
intuitions of sense and imagination and the general 
concepts of the understanding we may observe 
further that the controversy between nominalism 
and realism may be if not absolutely decided 
at least considerably simplified by attending 
to the same distinction some recent critics in 
examining this question have managed to introduce 
additional confusion into what was sufficiently 
confused before it is asked for example whether 
the great division of animal vegetable and mineral 
is not to be regarded as the work of nature rather 
than as the arbitrary product of mans classifica

tion undoubtedly but what has that to do with 
the question of the existence of universals out of 
the mind we admit that is that nature has 
stamped on certain locally distinct individuals a 
number of prominent features of resemblance 
which cannot fail to strike the eye of an observer 
but has she thereby produced any thing more 
than one set of attributes existing in one individual 
in one place and another similar set existing in 
another individual in another place but when 
by an act of mind we have abstracted from the 
existence in space under which all objects of sense 
are presented and by virtue of that abstraction 
have advanced from individual similarity to specific 
unity from the similar attributes of several objects 
to the mutual relation of all the results of the 
process can only be regarded as the offspring of 
our minds this consideration does not indeed 
prove decisively the impossibility of universals 
a parte rei but it shews that nor argument in 
favour of their existence can be drawn from the 
observed uniformities of nature 

another subject of dispute between different 
schools of philosophy is what are the limits of 
definition the scholastic logicians holding 
that definition was by genus and differentia very 
consistently laid it down as a canon that no object 

e since the publication of the first edition of this work 
i have been gratified at finding the same view maintained in 
an able discussion by m de remusat abelard vol ii p j 



prolegomena logica 

was definable which could not be regarded as a 
species summa genera and individuals were by 
this rule incapable of definition on the other 
hand descartes and locke rejecting this re 
striction maintain that simple ideas alone cannot 
be defined both are right according to th oil 
different meanings of definition with the former 
it signifies the resolution of a complex general 
concept into the simpler concepts which it com 
prehends with the latter it is the resolution of 
a complex individual object of sense into the sim 
pler objects of which it is composed the one 
a mental analysis of notions the other a sensible 
analysis of intuitions no definition as locke 
truly observes will convey the idea of whiteness 
to a blind man i e it will not enable him to form 
a sensible image of the colour but no definition 
in the scholastic sense was ever intended to 
accomplish this object the farfamed animal 
rationale does not do it for man and for the very 
sufficient reason that concepts as such are not 
capable of being presented in sense or imagin 
ation if the purpose of logical definition were to 
enable us to form an idea ie a representative 
image of an object pointing it out with the finger

an individual figure of the kind by sight from 
another which had sides but as addressed to

stration of the mathematical properties of the 
figure yet even here intuition though not 
directly applied is the virtual test of the possibility 
of the conception i may not be able distinctly 
to represent in an image or construct in a figure a 
thousand sides at once but it is from my intuitive 
consciousness of the same attributes as existing on 
a more limited scale that i know that there is 
nothing incompatible between the number of a 
thousand sides and the property of enclosing a 
space under this conviction the symbolical 
takes the place of the intuitive cognition and

constructing it with the hand or in the mind 

the same distinction will furnish a ground for 
criticising certain popular systems of logical no 
tation if logic is exclusively concerned with 
thought and thought is exclusively concerned 
with concepts it is impossible to approve of a 
practice sanctioned by some eminent logicians 
of representing the relation of terms in a syllogism 
by that of figures in a diagram to illustrate for 
example the position of the terms in barbara by 
a diagram of three circles one within another is 
to lose sight of the distinctive mark of a concept 
that it cannot be presented to the sense and 
tends to confuse the mental inclusion of one 
notion in the sphere of another with the local 
inclusion of a smaller portion of space in a 
larger h the diagrams of geometry in this respect 
furnish no precedent for they do not illustrate

chapter ii 

on the three operations op thought 

concerning the threefold division of the mental 
operations usually acknowledged by logicians it 
has been questioned whether they are properly to 
be regarded as distinct acts of thought or not 
the question may be considerably simplified by 
discriminating between different principles of 
identity or distinctness as applicable severally to 
mental and material objects the only natural 
and necessary principle of distinction between 
objects is the numerical diversity of individuals 
in this respect not only the several acts of 
simple apprehension judgment and reasoning 
but every single act of each class is distinct from 
every other an act of reasoning which i per 
form today is numerically distinct from any act 
performed yesterday though both may be governed 
by the same laws and applied to the same objects 
beyond this any principle of specific identity or 
diversity is to a certain extent arbitrary and arti 
ficial the only ground of distinction between a 
natural and an unnatural classification of indi 
viduals depends upon the frequency with which 



 prolegomena logica 

we have occasion to view them in this or that 
relation in other words on the respective utility 
of different points of view for certain given pur 
poses on this ground apprehension judgment 
and reasoning are rightly and necessarily regarded 
as distinct classes of mental operations relatively 
to logic inasmuch as their several products the 
concept the judgment and the syllogism exhibit 
distinct logical forms and require a distinct logical 
treatment 

psychologically the question must be examined 
on somewhat different grounds it may be urged 
for example on the one side that the several 
operations are the product of the single faculty of 
comparison that they are not in act ever separable 
from each other apprehension being always accom 
panied by judgment and judgment by appre 
hension and reasoning by both that the mind 
one and indivisible is wholly employed in each 
on the other side it may be answered that acts 
of comparison may be regarded as specifically 
distinct as engaged on distinct objects that the 
comparison of attributes with each other of con 
cepts immediately in themselves or mediately 
with a common third concept are pro tanto 
distinct acts that the same mind is not always 
equally skilful in all three and other arguments 
of the like kind both these opposite opinions 
may be accepted as true if we attend to the 
different points of view which render the decision 



prolegomena looica 

of all such matters of controversy in some degree 
arbitrary 

the distinction between the faculties and parts 
of the mind is based on a principle exactly the 
reverse of that by which a similar distinction is 
made relatively to the body the members of 
the latter are given as logically and numerically 
distinct and thus furnish a preexisting basis for 
the classification of their several operations 
thus seeing and hearing are distinguished from 
each other as the operations of the eye and the 
ear respectively and the use of the pen the 
brush and the chisel may in this point of view 
be classified together as operations of the hand 
whereas in the mind the distinctness of the 
operations is itself the ground on which for mere 
convenience of discussion we classify and distin 
guish different parts and faculties as belonging 
to the mind itself the acts therefore must 
on independent grounds be determined to be 
identical or distinct before we unite or separate 
them as related to the same or diverse mental 
powers

hence it appears that the classification of 
operations relatively to distinct mental faculties 
is contingent upon the adoption of some inde 
pendent principle for classifying the same operations 
in themselves in the present state of psychology 
much must be left to the discretion of individual 
inquirers no one division having been so universally 
adopted by philosophers or having led to such im 
portant results as to render imperative its adoption 
as the division ear cgoxrjv of psychologers but 
to suppose a distinct mental faculty for each of 
the three logical operations solely on the ground 
of the distinct objects compared in each is to say 
the least to make psychology unnecessarily com 
plicated and to offend against a rule of great 
weight in all systems of classification entia non 
sunt multiplicanda prceter necessitate™ indeed the 
several phenomena of conception judgment and 
reasoning viewed merely as mental acts and with 
out reference to the diversity of the data from 
which the act commences and with which it deals 
appear to furnish far more prominent features of 
similarity than of difference they are effected 
by the same means they are governed by the 
same laws they are confined within the same 
limits they admit of the same distinctions of 
material and formal validity the psychological 
analysis of any one may be applied almost in the 
same words to the others and so far as thought 
alone is concerned though not always in the

possession and management of the materials upon 
which thought is exercised the same mental 
qualities are manifested in the right performance 
of each in a psychological point of view to 
enumerate separate mental faculties as giving rise 
to the various products of thought is to say the 
least to encumber the science with unnecessary 
and perplexing distinctions it will be sufficient 
to refer them to the single faculty of thought the 
operation of which is in all cases comparison 

but the faculty of thought though uniform in 
its own nature and in the manner of its operation 
may yet give rise to different products according 
to the diversity of the materials upon which it 
operates and this difference as has already been 
observed forms the basis of the classification 
usually adopted in logic hence from the dif 
ferent point of view in which thought is contem 
plated by the two sciences there arises some 
diversity of detail which it is desirable to point 
out more particularly

• the division into simple apprehension judgment and

be laid down as a general canon of psychology that 
the unit of consciousness is a judgment in other 
words that every act of consciousness intuitive or 
discursive is comprised in a conviction of the 
presence of its object either internally in the mind 
or externally in space the result of every such 
act must thus be generally stated in the proposi 
tion this is here consequently at least with 
reference to the primary and spontaneous as dis 
tinguished from the secondary and reflex acts of 
consciousness it is more correct to describe appre 
hension as the analysis of judgments than judg 
ment as the synthesis of apprehensions 

in a psychological point of view therefore it is 
incorrect to describe simple apprehension as the 
first operation of the mind in one sense indeed 
the relation of prior and posterior is altogether 
out of place chronologically inasmuch as every 
apprehension is simultaneous with a judgment 
and every judgment with an apprehension and 
logically inasmuch as judgment cannot exist 
without apprehension nor apprehension without 
judgment in another sense however we may 
properly say that judgment is prior to appre 
hension meaning that the subject and the object 
are first given in their mutual relation to each

other before either of them can itself become 
a separate object of attention but when a corre 
sponding division is adopted of the operations of 
thought properly so called the same order of 
priority cannot be observed every operation of 
thought is a judgment in the psychological sense 
of the term but the psychological judgment must 
not be confounded with the logical the former 
is the judgment of a relation between the conscious 
subject and the immediate object of consciousness 
the latter is the judgment of a relation which 

co objects of thought bear to each other the 
•mer cannot be distinguished as true or false 
inasmuch as the object is thereby only judged 
to be present at the moment when we are con 
scious of it as affecting us in a certain manner 
and this consciousness is necessarily true the 
latter is true or false according as the relations 
thought as existing between certain concepts 
are actually found in the objects represented by 
those concepts or not the logical judgment 
necessarily contains two concepts and hence must 
be regarded as logically and chronologically pos 
terior to the conception which requires one only 
the psychological judgment is coeval with the 
first act of consciousness and is implied in every 
mental process whether of intuition or of thought 
it cannot therefore be called prior or posterior to 
any other mental operation for there is no mental

in this place in relation to their several logical 
products the three operations may be distinguished 
as follows 

conceiving has been already explained as the 
individualising of certain attributes comprehended 
in a general notion and expressed in a general 
term the representation namely of such attri 
butes as coexisting in a possible object of intuition 
language as before observed is in its earliest 
operations a sign not of concepts but of in 
tuitions its earliest terms are employed as the 
proper names of individual objects conception 
does not take place till after we have learned to 
give the same name to various individuals pre 
sented to us with certain differences of attributes 
and hence to associate it with a portion only not 
with the whole of what is presented in each this 
may be distinguished as abstraction a spontaneous 
though not always a voluntary act the concen 
tration of the mind on certain portions only of 
a given object in relation to its name this 
must not be treated as is frequently done by 
logicians as a conscious process of thought 
being only a preliminary condition to thinking 
taking place in the majority of cases uncon 
sciously during the gradual acquisition of speech 

 abstraction as described by stewart elements vol i 
ch answers in essential points to what i have here de 
scribed it should be observed however that by language 
as it now operates whatever may have been the case in 

f 



 prolegomena logica 

our names thus gradually acquire a signification 
being transformed from proper names to appel 
latives finally the act of conception consists in 
contemplating the attributes thus combined in 
the signification of a name as coexisting along 
with individual features in a possible object of 
intuition and hence apart from the individual 
features as indifferently representing all such 
objects this representative collection of attri 
butes combined by means of a sign is a concept 

in the above remarks the office of language is 
considered as it now exists and is taught not as it 
might possibly have been originally created we 
do not form our own language but receive it 
ready formed and its teaching whether true or 
deceitful whether promoting or distorting the 
right development of the mind does as matter of 
fact impress us from our infancy upwards with 
certain associations and casts our earliest thoughts 
in a certain mould from which no future effort 
can wholly emancipate us i am not now con 
sidering what might have been the course of our 
mental growth had we been the original inventors 
of our mother tongue or if we had been born 
among a people with whom as in a hypothesis 

its first formation the question as to what attributes shall 
be abstracted and what retained is in a great measure deter 
mined for us the process must thus be distinguished from 
the voluntary abstraction implied in all operations of thought

ginary philosophers or as it may have influenced 
the thoughts of adam in paradise but as it 
does influence the thoughts of children born into 
the world the offspring of articulatelyspeaking 
parents 

as in conception a single general notion is 
considered in its relation to a possible object of 
intuition so in judgment two such notions are 
considered as related to a common object when 
i assert that a is b i do not mean that the attri 
butes constituting the concept a are identical 
with those constituting the concept b for this is 
only true in identical judgments but that the 
object in which the one set of attributes is found 
is the same as that in which the other set is found 
to assert that all philosophers re liable to error 
is not to assert that the signification of the term 
philosopher is identical with that of liable to 
error but that the aftributes comprehended in 
these two distinct terms are in some manner 
united in the same subject to ask what con 
stitutes unity or identity in a subject of attributes 
is to enter on a deep metaphysical question the 
discussion of which must be postponed to a later 
stage of our inquiry it is sufficient for the present

to observe that the common language and com 
mon thought of mankind universally acknowledge 
something of the kind assuming whether they 
can explain it or not that a certain smell and 
colour and form which are distinct attributes are 
in some way related as parts or qualities to some 
one thing which we call a rose and that when 
i assert that the rose is fragrant i imply that 
the thing which affects in a certain way my power 
of sight is in some manner identical with that 
which affects in a certain way my power of smell 
the metaphysical problem thus lies at the bottom 
both of conception and of judgment and whether 
it admits of satisfactory explanation or not must 
be included as a fact in any description of the 
several operations of thought 

reasoning is the most complex of the three 
operations as in it two concepts are determined 
to be in a certain manner related to each other 
through the medium of their mutual relations to a 
third concept this operation is therefore treated

asserted in the premises and deduced in the con 
clusion are the same as those implied in judgment 
and lead to the same metaphysical difficulties 
these together with the logical and psychological 
character of the laws of thought will be con 
sidered in a future chapter for the present it 
will be sufficient to attempt in accordance with 
the above observations a definition of the products 
of the several acts of thought the concept the 
judgment and the syllogism the legitimate objects 
of formal logic 

a concept is a collection of attributes united 
by a sign and representing a possible object of 
intuition 

a judgment is a combination of two concepts 
related to one or more common objects of possible 
intuition 

a syllogism is a combination of two judgments 
necessitating a third judgment as the consequence 
of their mutual relation 

the definition above given of a judgment 
renders necessary a few remarks on a class of 
propositions whose true logical character has been 
considerably misapprehended by eminent autho 
rities according to the above definition every 
judgment in logic must be regarded as a com 
bination of concepts every term of such judg 
ment as the sign of a concept this is no less 
true of singular than of common judgments and 
the neglect of it has given rise to some errors in 



 prolegomena logica 

the logical treatment of propositions proper 
names says mr mill denote the individuals 
who are called by them but they do not indicate 
or imply any attributes as belonging to those 
individuals when we name a child by the name 
mary or a dog by the name caesar these names 
are simply marks used to enable those individuals 
to be made subjects of discourse it may be said 
indeed that we must have had some reason for 
giving them those names rather than any others 
and this is true but the name once given 
becomes independent of the reason a man may 
have been named john because that was the 
name of his father a town may have been named 
dartmouth because it is situated at the mouth of 
the dart but it is no part of the signification of 
the word john that the father of the person so 
called bore the same name nor even of the word 
dartmouth to be situated at the mouth of the 
dart 

these remarks are true so far as the name 
alone is concerned or as regards the reason of its 
being imposed at a certain time on a certain man 
but then the man as an individual existing at 
some past time cannot become immediately an 
object of thought and hence is not properly 
speaking the subject of any logical proposition 
if i say t€ caesar was the conqueror of pompey 

 mills logic vol i p 



prolegomena logica 

the immediate object of my thought is not caesar 
as an individual existing nearly two thousand years 
ago but a concept now present in my mind com 
prising certain attributes which i believe to have 
coexisted in a certain man i may historically 
know that these attributes existed in one indi 
vidual only and hence my concept virtually 
universal is actually singular from the accident 
of its being predicable of that individual only 
but there is no logical objection to the theory 
that the whole history of mankind may be repeated 
at recurring intervals and that the name and 
actions of caesar may be successively found in 
various individuals at corresponding periods of 
every cycle 

 alter erit turn tiphys et altera quee vehat argo 
delectos heroas erunt etiam altera bella 
atque iterum ad trojam magnus mittetur achilles 

these remarks will suggest a correction of the 
ordinary logical account of the quantity of pro 
positions which should have been made long ago 
the subjects of all logical judgments are concepts 
the true singular proposition in logic is not one 
in which the concept is materially limited to an 
individual by extralogical considerations but one 
in which it is formally so limited by a sign of indi 
viduality in scholastic language only individua 
demonstrative and not as is vulgarly taught 
individua signata are properly the subjects of 



 prolegomena logic a 

singular propositions indefinite or as they 
should rather be called indesignate k propositions 
are an anomaly in logic no less when the subject 
is a singular than when it is a common term in 
both the quantity can only be known by the 
matter and in both an appeal to the matter is 
extralogical 

the same considerations will also shew the 
propriety of aristotles limitation of the logical 
verb to the present tense only all thought is 
a consciousness of present mental acts and its 
object is not the past event but the present con 
cept of it hence the office of the verb in logic 
is not to declare the past or future connection of 
an attribute with its subject in the represented fact 
but to declare the present coexistence of two con 
cepts in the representative act of thought

will be desirable to compare the conclusions arrived 
at with those of two eminent philosophers from 
both of whom they appear verbally at least to 
differ in a slight degree 

lockes wellknown definition of knowledge 
 the perception of the agreement or disagreement 
of two ideas has been somewhat severely com 
mented on by his illustrious critic m cousin m 
the french philosopher shews clearly that in 
many of our judgments we cannot be said to 
have distinct notions of the terms united prior to 
pronouncing on the fact of their agreement the 
distinctions drawn in the preceding remarks will 
i think furnish a ground for a more exact decision 
of the point at issue than has been given either 
by the english philosopher or his french censor 
lockes definition abounds in verbal inaccuracy 
for which however the author is not entirely 
responsible as it is partly owing to the unsettled 
signification in his day of philosophical terms 
which have since been more accurately determined 
taking perception in the strict sense to which it 
has been determined by reid and his successors 
it is not correct to say in general terms that the 
agreement of ideas is in all cases perceived ex 
tending knowledge as locke himself does to

include the evidence of the senses it is incorrect 
to say that in all knowledge we have a distinct 
consciousness of two ideas and their agreement 
and the term idea itself used loosely by locke 
as by descartes for any object of consciousness 
admits of a variety of subordinate senses in some 
of which the definition is assuredly inaccurate 
but as limited to the logical judgment proper 
as it has been above distinguished from the psy 
chological the definition is substantially correct 
though susceptible of some verbal improvement 
in every logical judgment there is a union of 
concepts and every concept is represented by 
a sign the concepts themselves must be re 
garded as existing in the mind before their 
union and the signs being practically furnished 
by the existing terms of a language the 
logical judgment may be properly described as 
formed by the combination of concepts as its 
representative the proposition is formed by the 
combination of terms but to the judgments 
distinguished as psychological the definition of 
locke is inapplicable and here the objections of 
m cousin may be urged with full effect such 
are all the spontaneous judgments of the per 
ceptive and imaginative faculties such too is the 
cartesian cogito ergo sui a primitive judgment 
not of the senses but of the internal consciousness 
which the opponents of descartes from gassendi

to kant have misrepresented as a logical reason 
ing from concepts the definition of locke is 
therefore correct as far as regards judgments of 
thought properly so called judgments forihed by 
means of concepts and consequently of language 
and whose constituent parts are given piecemeal in 
words and put together by the mind in the act of 
judging it is incorrect as regards all judgments 
whether concerning the ego or the nonego which 
the mind forms for itself by an immediate act of 
consciousness without the aid of verbal or other 
signs of voluntary institution 

from the definition of locke we proceed to 
consider that of kant in the critical philosophy 
thought and judgment are synonymous and the 
act of the understanding the understanding may 
be defined indifferently the faculty of thinking or 
the faculty of judging for all thought is cognition 
by means of concepts and all concepts are the 
predicates of possible judgments and are by such 
judgments referred to objects of sensible intuition 
either immediately or through the interposition of

in a psychological point of view the kantian 
definition of judgment is too narrow as it virtually 
denies that any act of judgment whatever is per 
formed in the exercise of the intuitive faculties 
a denial which the author repeats still more 
explicitly in other passages r in a logical point

being made coextensive with the whole of thought 
including therefore under it conception or simple 
apprehension every concept according to kant 
is the predicate of a possible judgment in which it 
may be affirmed of any of the objects of intuition 
included within its sphere he might have gone 
further and said that in all positive thinking 
the possible judgment becomes an actual one 
but it is a psychological not a logical judgment 
it affirms only the mental existence of the object 
as now present in thought and the affirmation 
is necessarily true whatever be the nature of the 
object to make the doctrine of kant consistent 
the province assigned to judgment must be either 
extended or contracted it must either be extended 
to denote every consciousness of a relation between 
subject and object i e to every operation of mind 
or it must be contracted to denote the conscious 
ness of a relation between two objects of thought 
in which case it does not extend beyond the logical 
judgment by means of at least two concepts 

having thus pointed out the distinction of 
thought from other mental acts and its various 
subdivisions relatively to logic i shall proceed to 
offer a few observations on the nature of law in 
so far as that term is applicable to a conscious 
subject 



chapter iii 

on law as related to thought and other objects 

the following passage from archbishop whatelys 
logic may serve as an appropriate introduction 
to this part of our subject what may be 
called a mathematical impossibility is that which 
involves an absurdity and selfcontradiction e g 
that two straight lines should inclose a space is 
not only impossible but inconceivable as it would 
be at variance with the definition of a straight 
line and it should be observed that inability to 
accomplish any thing which is in this sense im 
possible implies no limitation of power and is 
compatible even with omnipotence in the fullest 
sense of the word if it be proposed e g to 
construct a triangle having one of its sides equal 
to the other two or to find two numbers having 
the same ratio to each other as the side of a 
square and its diameter it is not from a defect of 
power that we are precluded from solving such a 
problem as these since in fact the problem is 
in itself unmeaning and absurd it is in reality 
nothing that is required to be done

substantially perhaps this is not far from the 
truth but it may be stated in a more satisfactory 
form by divesting it of a hypothesis which even 
if true and this we have no means of ascertain 
ing may for the present purpose be dispensed 
with b 

when any thing is said to be inconceivable it 
is thereby acknowledged that the human mind is 
not altogether unrestricted in its operations it is 
bounded not only as regards the sphere of objects 
of which it is permitted to take cognisance but 
also as regards the manner in which it is capable 
of thinking about objects within that sphere in 
other words there are laws under which the mind 
is compelled to think and which it cannot trans 
gress otherwise than negatively by ceasing to 
think at all 

the existence then of laws of thought is a 
fact of which our everyday consciousness assures 
us necessity of whatsoever kind implies a ne 
cessary agent that is an agent acting under a law 
if then any question can be proposed to the mind 
of man which he feels himself compelled to decide 
in one way only that compulsion is at once an 

b in venturing to criticise this note one of the most 
valuable portions of the archbishops work i beg to state 
that it is to the wording only of the first part that my 
remarks are intended to apply with the just and philo 
sophical distinction laid down in the same place between the 
three senses of the word impossibility i have only to express 
full concurrence

evidence of the existence of laws which as a 
thinker he is compelled to obey 

and this admission is all that is required for 
the solution of such difficulties as that suggested 
above if our whole thinking is subject to certain 
laws it follows that we cannot think of any object 
not even of omnipotence itself except as those 
laws compel us the limitation does not lie in 
the object of which we think but in the thinking 
subject whatsoever we imagine says hobbes 
 is finite therefore there is no idea or con 
ception of any thing we call infinite no man can 
have in his mind an image of infinite magnitude 
nor conceive infinite swiftness infinite time or 
infinite force or infinite power when we say 
any thing is infinite we signify only that we are 
not able to conceive the ends and bounds of the 
things named having no conception of the thing 
but of our own inability v 

it may be indeed that the conditions of possible 
thought correspond to conditions of possible being 
that what is to us inconceivable is in itself non 

c leviathan i p ed molesworth this opinion of 
hobbes has been severely censured by cudworth intellectual 
system b i ch v sect who however mistakes the meaning 
of the assertion both in what it expresses and in what it 
implies the error of cudworth in this respect has been 
corrected by his learned translator mosheim who though no 
friend to hobbess views in general admits that in this par 
ticular his doctrine is not liable to the objections urged 
against it see harrisons edition of cudworth vol ii

existent but of this from the nature of the 
case it is impossible to have any evidence if 
man as a thinker is subject to necessary laws he 
cannot examine the absolute validity of the laws 
themselves except by assuming the whole question 
at issue for such examination must itself be 
conducted in subordination to the same conditions 
whatever weakness therefore there may be in 
the object of criticism the same must necessarily 
affect the critical process itself 

we may indeed believe and ought to believe 
that the powers which our creator has bestowed 
upon us are not given as the instruments of 
deception we may believe and ought to believe 
that intellectually no less than morally the pre 
sent life is a state of discipline and preparation for 
another and that the portion of knowledge which 
our limited faculties are permitted to attain to 
here may indeed in the eyes of a higher intel 
ligence be but partial truth but cannot be 
absolute falsehood but in believing thus we 
desert the evidence of reason to rest on that of 
faith and of the principles on which reason 
itself depends it is obviously impossible to have 
any other guarantee 

d in itself distinguished from as an object of thought as 

the latter it is of course impossible the distinction between 

•things per and things as objects of thought will be familiar 

to every reader of kant it is in fact the cardinal point of 

the whole critical philosophy

but such a faith however well founded has but 
a regulative and practical not a speculative appli 
cation it bids us rest content within the limits 
which have been assigned to us it cannot enable 
us to overleap them or to exalt to a more abso 
lute character the conclusions obtained by finite 
thinkers concerning finite objects of thought 
for the same condition which disqualifies us from 
criticising the laws of thought must also deprive 
us of the power of ascertaining how much of the 
results of those laws is true in itself and how 
much is relative and dependent upon the parti 
cular bodily or mental constitution of man during 
the present life to determine this question it 
would be necessary to examine the same con 
clusions with a new set of faculties f and under 
new conditions of thought so as to separate what 
is merely relative to the existing state of human 

e when kant kritik der r v p declares that the objects 
of our intuition are not in themselves as they appear to us he 
falls into the opposite extreme to that which he is combating 
the critic becomes a dogmatist in negation to warrant 
this conclusion we must previously have compared things as 
they are with things as they seem a comparison which is em 
hypothesi impossible we can only say that we have no 
means of determining whether they agree or not and in the 
absence of proof on either side the presumption is in favour 
of what is at least subjectively true the onus probandi lies 
with the assailant not with the defender of our faculties

consciousness from what is absolute and common 
to other intelligences 

in accordance with these views we are natu 
rally led to regard all the hitherto unsolved pro 
blems of metaphysics as requiring to be treated 
from a psychological instead of an ontological 
point of view instead of asking what are the 
circumstances in the constitution of things by 
virtue of which they present such and such diffi 
culties and contradictions to human understanding 
we must ask what are the circumstances of the 
human understanding itself by virtue of which a 
distinction exists between the conceivable and the 
inconceivable such in fact was the revolution 
introduced by kant into metaphysical speculation 
a revolution which he aptly compares to that 
effected in astronomy by copernicus when he 
thought of investigating the apparent motion of 

 truth relative to no intelligence is a contradiction in 
terms as it implies a relation existing after one of the cor 
relatives has been annihilated our only possible notion of 
absolute truth is a truth relative to all intelligences if all 
truth is subjective which implies a cognitive power omni

the heavens from the side of the spectator instead 
of from that of the objects the advantages of 
such a treatment are obvious from the objective 
view we obtain only the fact that certain questions 
have up to the present time remained unsolved 
from the subjective view we learn why they are 
insoluble and the answer to this question deter 
mines the laws and limits of thought the abuse 
of the method appears in the attempts of the suc 
cessors of kant especially of schelling and hegel 
to construct a philosophy of the absolute from the 
subjective side by denying in certain relations the 
validity of those laws of thought which they 
acknowledge in others and endeavouring thereby 
to do away with relation in consciousness alto 
gether such a system with whatever ability it 
may be constructed carries in its fundamental 
conception the germ of its own refutation it 
commences by giving the lie to consciousness it 
proceeds by dividing the human mind against 
itself the understanding against the reason and 
the reason against the understanding it ends by 
leaving no test by which its own truth can be 
determined but the philosophy of kant is like 
the spear of achilles and possesses virtue to heal 
the wounds which it has itself inflicted while it 
is impossible to deny the lineal descent of the 
philosophy of schelling and of hegel from a one 
sided view of kantian principles it is equally clear 
that the only satisfactory refutation of the extra 



prolegomena logica 

vagances of that philosophy must be based on a 
sober acknowledgment of those laws and limits of 
the mental faculties which kant has been mainly 
instrumental in pointing out 

we must admit then that our present faculties 
are trustworthy guides to that portion of know 
ledge which god designs us to attain to in our 
present state that the laws to which these faculties 
are subjected though perhaps not absolutely bind 
ing on things in themselves are binding upon our 
mode of contemplating them that while we obey 
these laws we seek after truth according to our 
kind and in conformity with the end of our intel 
lectual being and that when we neglect them 
we abandon ourselves to every form of error or 
rather we lose all power of discerning between 
error and truth we commence by an act of intel 
lectual suicide and construct a system which by 
virtue of its fundamental principle must disclaim 
all superiority over and decline to combat with 
any rival theory its sole claim to attention being 
that it may for aught we know be true or false 
or both or neither 

to apply these principles to the question with 
which we commenced among the limitations to 
which even omnipotence is regarded as subject 
none is of older birth or has been more frequently 
alleged than the impossibility of undoing an act 
already done

now it may be that time and space are as kant 
maintains merely subjective conditions of human 
sensibility as such they limit the whole exercise 
of human thought but the limits of the thinking 
faculty are limits of things as objects of thought 
only and beyond that sphere we know nothing 
it may be that the whole distinction of past 
present and future has no place relatively to other 
intelligences than ours still that distinction con 
tinues to influence all human thought and every 
act as an object of thought must be regarded as 
taking place according to the conditions of temporal 
succession if we cease to regard it in this light 
we do not extend our knowledge but abandon the 
problem as humanly speaking unthinkable the 
limitation then is not of omnipotence in itself but 
of all power as the object of human thought h the 
ultimate consequence of this admission will be that 
the unlimited is not an object of human thought 
at all it may be an object of human belief but 
the two provinces are not coextensive 

so again with reference to the impossibility of 

b this distinction is drawn by locke in his second reply 
to the bishop of worcester but it is further urged that 
we cannot conceive how matter can think i grant it but to 
argue from thence that god therefore cannot give to matter 
a faculty of thinking is to say god s omnipotency is limited 
to a narrow compass because mans understanding is so 
and brings down gods infinite power to the size of our 
capacities

it would seem as if a distinctive criterion might 
a priori be determined from a mere analysis of 
the notion of law and its operation 

setting aside for an instant the question how 
the mind of man is actually constituted let us 
suppose an intelligent being subject to laws under 
which he is compelled to think and placed in the 
midst of a world of material agents subject to laws 
under which they must act what would be the 
distinctive character presented to his mind by these 
respective laws of himself and of the world without 
the laws of the planetary motions are absolutely 
binding on the moving bodies themselves inde 
pendently of the existence of astronomical science 
but it is optional with an intelligent being to 
study astronomy or not and when he does so he 
observes as matter of fact how such laws influence 
their own subordinate agents but he does not 
himself become an agent under their influence 
as facts of his experience they are known solely 
in and through his observation as laws within 
their own sphere they are independent of his 
knowing aught about them but the laws of his 
mind come into operation as laws when the act of 
thinking commences and are binding not on this

or that class of physical phenomena but upon 
the thinker himself in the contemplation of all of 
them hence it is not optional with him whether 
he will think according to these or other conditions 
choose what object of study he will he cannot 
think at all he cannot conceive his liberty of 
choosing without being ipso facto under their 
influence hence arises an obvious criterion 
a law which is not binding upon me as a thinker 
may at any time be reversed without affecting my 
mode of observing the same agents under their 
new conditions and i have no difficulty in 
conceiving such a reversal as at any moment 
possible because antecedent to experience i had 
no internal bias which required the recognition 
of the existing law rather than of any other i 
have only to discard an adventitious knowledge 
but the reversal of a necessary law of thought 
supposing that there are such is from the nature 
of the case inconceivable for conception is 
itself the servant of the law and ex hypothesi 
cannot rebel against it i cannot by an act of 
thought annihilate the conditions by which all 
thought is governed i can indeed admit the 
possibility that there may be other beings thinking 
under other laws but i can form no positive 
conception of their nature such a supposition 
is not thought but its negation a mind cannot 
think by other laws than its own

all necessary truths must have their origin in the

truth but it is true of triangles only and cannot 
be applied to any other object but that the 
same subject cannot possess contradictory attri 
butes is a principle equally applicable to the 
objects of geometrical demonstration and to the 
most contingent facts of sensible experience it 
is equally certain that no man can at once be 
standing and not standing as that the angles of a 
triangle cannot be both equal and unequal to two 
right angles hence the criterion of absolute 
necessity though valid as far as it goes is not

adequate to determine the whole question it 
serves to distinguish judgments a priori from 
judgments of experience it does not distinguish 
between different classes of the former nor explain 
their several relations to the mind which is the 
common source of all of the various judgments 
which have been enumerated by philosophers as 
necessary truths it will be sufficient for our present 
purpose to select three classes which may be 
severally distinguished as mathematical meta 
physical and logical necessity all these being 
in different ways regarded as absolutely and 
universally necessary must be considered as in 
different ways dependent on laws of our mental 
constitution from all must be distinguished 
what is commonly called physical necessity or 
belief in the permanence of laws of nature 
the several distinctions may be represented by 
the following questions 

ii why do i judge that a triangle can under 
no circumstances whatever have its angles greater 
or less than two right angles 

ii why do i judge that every sehsible quality 
must belong to some subject and that every 
change is and must be brought about by some 
cause 

iii why do i judge that two contradictory 
attributes can under no circumstances whatever 
coexist in the same subject 

iv why do i judge that the alternations of 



 prolegomena logica 

day and night will not under the existing circum 
stances of our globe cease to take place 

the last of these obviously stands on a different 
ground from the other three i am immediately 
cognisant of law only as i am conscious of its 
obligation upon myself the law itself may be 
physical intellectual or moral but to know it as 
a law i must know it as a condition which i 
cannot or ought not to transgress law in this 
sense as a discerned obligation can obviously 
exist only in relation to a conscious agent and 
even with regard to conscious agents other than 
myself i only infer the existence of the law from 
a supposed similarity between their constitutions 
and my own but as regards unconscious agents 
law means no more than a constantly observed 
fact in its highest generalization when i speak 
of the alternations of day and night as consequent 
on a law of nature i mean no more than that the 
alternation has invariably been observed to take 
place and when i resolve such alternations into 
the law of the earths rotation i mean only that 
the earth does constantly revolve on her axis once 
in twentyfour hours or if i could resolve all 
the phenomena of the material world into an 
universal law of gravitation i should obtain no 
more than the universal fact that all particles of 
matter in the universe do gravitate towards each 
other and that certain subordinate combinations 
of those particles present certain phenomena in so

doing but i have not by this resolution got any 
nearer to necessity for the gravitation of bodies 
in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance 
is like the ebb and flow of the tides or the 
elliptical orbits of the planets an observed fact 
in the order of nature and it is no more my 
belief in the continuance of this observed order 
may perhaps be explained by some law of my 
mental constitution but as thus explained it is 
a law of mind and not of matter under what 
circumstances certain facts of nature may be 
resolved into others and what kinds of experiment 
and observation will contribute to this end are 
questions which with all their importance are 
totally distinct from those which form the object 
of the present inquiry 

i shall only observe here that to call such 
questions a portion of logic that is to regard the 
new organon as a supplement to the old and 
both as forming parts of the same science is to 
confound two essentially distinct branches of 
knowledge distinct in their end in their means 
and in their evidence we do not enlarge the 
sciences says kant but disfigure them when 
we suffer their boundaries to run into one another

truths we are compelled to admit as every where 
and at all times necessary must have their origin 
not without in the laws of the sensible world but 
within in the constitution of the mind itself 
sundry attempts have indeed been made to derive 
them from sensible experience and constant asso

by a criterion decisive of the fate of all hypotheses 
it does not account for the phenomena it does 
not account for the fact that other associations 
as frequent and as uniform are incapable of pro

might have been expected beforehand for the 
utmost rigour in a law of the sensible world may 
furnish a sufficient reason why phenomena must 
take place in a certain manner but furnishes no 
reason at all why i must think so 

but it is one thing to recognise the operation 
of a mental law and another to discover the law 
itself the distinction above noticed between 
mathematical metaphysical and logical neces 
sity implies that although the origin of all is to 
be sought for in the mind itself they are in some 
way differently related to one or other of the 
special faculties of their common source we 
must further inquire what is the peculiar relation 
of the mind to mathematical ideas by virtue of 
which not merely the general laws of all thinking 
but the special applications of those laws in arith 
metic and geometry possess a necessity which is 
not found when they are applied to concepts 
generalized from experience how is it that in 
some reasonings both matter and form can be 
furnished by the mind itself while in others the 
form alone is from the mind the matter being 
derived from experience

necessary to give some account of kants cele 
brated distinction between analytical and syn 
thetical judgments an analytical or explicative 
judgment contains nothing in the predicate but 
what has been already implied in the conception 
of the subject for example since the con 
ception of body implies extension the proposition 
 all bodies are extended is an analytical judg 
ment of this character are all propositions in 
which in scholastic language the predicate is said 
to be of the essence of the subject whether a part 
of the essence as in the predication of genus or 
differentia or the sum of the parts as in a 
definition in a synthetical or ampliative judg 
ment on the other hand the predicate adds an 
attribute to the subject which has not been already 
thought therein thus the proposition •• all bodies 
ar heavy is a synthetical judgment the attribute 
heavy not being thought in the mere conception 
of body of this kind are all propositions in which 
the predicate is said to be joined to the essence of 
the subject as a property or accident 

all analytical judgments are formed by the mind 
a priori whether the notion analysed be empirical 
or not for the mind having once gained this 
notion as a subject has no occasion for any addi 
tional experience to determine the predicate which 

d the substitution of definition for species is intentional

is already given therein any science whatever 
may therefore have abundance of necessary truths 
of this kind but such do not contribute in any 
way to the extension of our knowledge but only 
to a more distinct consciousness of what we 
already possess a synthetical judgment on the 
other hand is a positive extension of our know 
ledge but requires for its formation something 
more than the concept which stands as its subject 
all empirical judgments are synthetical but 
mathematical necessity requires that the mind 
should be able to form for itself synthetical judg 
ments not dependent on experience 

the axioms of geometry contain specimens of 
both kinds of judgment those which relate ex 
clusively to geometrical objects such as a straight 
line is the shortest distance between two points v 
 two straight lines cannot enclose a space two 
straight lines which being met by a third make the

axioms which are not peculiar to geometry the 
common principles of aristotle k such as the whole

added to equals the sums are equal are analytical

merely various statements of the principle of 
identity every thing is equal to itself or

of the second by b the axiom if equals be added

judgments of identity opera erdm p he selects as a 
specimen the analytical judgment the whole is greater than

been under the peculiar principles tduu apxai of aristotle

 prolegomena logca 

the former claps of axioms determine the pecu 
liar character of all the conclusions of geometry 
the latter have no peculiar relation to mathematics 
but depend on the general conditions of all think 
ing whatever and have therefore a logical not a 
mathematical necessity the whole question of 
the superior necessity of geometry to physical 
science depends upon the manner in which we 
account for the origin of the synthetical axioms 
relating to magnitudes as such as an instance 
we may take the proposition two straight lines 
cannot enclose a space 

an eminent writer of the present day has laboured 
hard to prove that this principle is nothing but a 
generalization from experience and consequently 
that our belief in the superior necessity of mathe 
matical as compared with physical truths is a mere 
selfdeception he lays much stress on one of 
the characteristic properties of geometrical forms 
their capacity of being painted in the imagination 
with a distinctness equal to reality in other words 
the exact resemblance of our ideas of form to the 
sensations which suggest them but while it is 
impossible to deny the ability with which mr mill 
combats the notion of an a priori necessity in 
mathematics it is impossible to assent to an argu

consciousness nor does his reasoning against

prolegomena logica 

ad hominem meet the real question at issue what 
is required is to account not for the necessity of 
geometrical axioms as truths relating to objects 
without the mind but as thoughts relating to objects 
within mathematical judgments are true of real 
objects only hypothetically if there exist any 
where in the world a pair of perfect straight lines 
those lines cannot enclose a space but if such 
lines exist no where but in my imagination it is 
equally the case that i cannot think of them as 
invested with the contrary attribute that which 
is to be accounted for is not the physical fact that 
certain visible objects possess certain properties 
but the psychological fact that in the case of 
geometrical magnitudes i am compelled to invest 
imagined objects with attributes not gained by 
mere analysis of the notion under which they are 
thought — a compulsion of which i am not conscious 
with regard to the most uniform associations of 
phenomena within the field of sensible experience 
a sensible object may have been familiar to me from 
childhood but suppose the external reality de 
stroyed i can assert nothing with certainty of its 
imaginary representative except what is contained 
in the concept itself so long as i have to conform 
my judgments not to the actual laws of the exist 
ing course of nature but to the possible conditions 
of an imaginary state of things i have no difficulty 
in attributing contradictory attributes successively 
to the same object i may imagine the sun rising 



 prolegomena logica 

and setting as now for years and afterwards 
remaining continually fixed in the meridian yet 
my experience of the alternations of day and night 
has been at least as invariable as of the geo 
metrical properties of bodies i can imagine the 
satne stone sinking times in the water and 
floating the th but my experience invariably 
repeats the former phenomenon only whereas 
in the case of two straight lines which so far as 
they are objects of experience stand only on a 
level with the above and similar instances the 
mind finds itself compelled to assert as necessary 
one attribute not contained in the concept and 
to reject its contradictory as impossible 

the possibility of forming synthetical judgments 
a priori in geometry admits of only one adequate 
explanation viz that the presentative intuition as 
well as the representative notion is derived from 
within not from without in other words that 
both the matter and form of the judgment are 
determined subjectively if it can be shewn that 
the object of which pure geometry treats is not 
dependent on sensibility but sensibility on it that 
it is a condition under which alone sensible 
experience is possible it is obvious that its charac 
teristics must accompany all our thoughts con 
cerning any possible object of such experience 
that its laws must be equally binding upon the 
imaginary representation as upon the sensible 
percept for abstract as we may from this or that 



prolegomena logic a 

particular phenomenon of experience we are clearly 
incompetent to deprive it of those conditions under 
which alone experience itself is possible 

such a condition is furnished to us by the intui 
tion of space that this is a subjective condition 
of all sensible perception and not a mere empirical 
generalization from a special class of phenomena 
is evident from the fact that it is impossible by any 
effort of thought to contemplate sensible objects 
save under this condition we may shift our atten 
tion at will from this object to that but we can 
think of none save as existing in space we may 
conceive the whole world of sensible phenomena 
to be annihilated by the fiat of omnipotence but 
the annihilation of space itself is beyond the power 
of thought to contemplate that things in them 
selves must exist in space and as such must be so 
presented to every possible intelligence is more 
than we may venture to affirm but this much is 
certain that man by a law of his nature is com 
pelled to perceive and to think of them as so 
existing 

upon this law of the mind depends the certainty 
of geometrical axioms as thoughts though not as 
truths the peculiar figures of space must indeed 
be originally suggested empirically from observ 
ation of the actual figures of body but this expe 
rience is stillsubject to the same condition bodies 
cannot be perceived or imagined but in space 
bodies of this or that figure cannot be perceived or 



 prolegomena logica 

imagined but as occupying a similarly figured 
space the modifications originally suggested by 
the former become an object of thought as 
existing in the latter and the features exhibited 
now and here in the one we are compelled to 
think as existing always and every where in the 
other 

the sensationalist is therefore in a certain sense 
right in deriving geometrical axioms from expe 
rience it must be conceded to him that had 
we never seen two straight lines had we never 
observed that as a matter of fact they did not in 
that particular instance enclose a space we should 
never have arrived at the conviction that they 
cannot do so in any instance but this is equally 
true of any product of the imagination if i had 
never seen separately the upper parts of a man 
and the lower parts of a horse i could not unite 
them together in the fantastic image of a centaur 
if i had never seen any black object i could not 
combine that colour with a known form so as to 
produce the imagination of a black swan but 
why is it that in the one case i find no difficulty 
whatever in going beyond or against the whole 
testimony of my past experience while in the 
other such transgression is altogether out of my 
power experience has uniformly presented to 
me a horses body in conjunction with a horses 
head and a mans head with a mans body just 
as experience has uniformly presented to me space 



prolegomena logica 

enclosed within a pair of curved lines and not 
within a pair of straight ones why do i in the 
former case consider the results of my experience 
as contingent only and transgressible confined to 
the actual phenomena of a limited field and 
possessing no value beyond it while in the latter 
i am compelled to regard them as necessary and 
universal why can i give in imagination to a 
quadruped body what experience assures me is 
possessed by bipeds only and why can i not 
in like manner invest straight lines with an attri 
bute which experience has uniformly presented in 
curves 

can it be said that the ideas in the latter case 
are contradictory and that their union is therefore 
forbidden by the laws of formal thinking by 
no means straight and curved viewed merely as 
objects of sense are opposed only as black and 
white or as biped and quadruped they cannot 
that is be thought as existing at the same time in 
the same subject but that property which expe 
rience testifies to have universally accompanied 
curved lines is not merely by virtue of that expe 
rience more incompatible with straight ones than 
the head which has uniformly accompanied a 
biped body is incompatible with a quadruped one 
or than the form which experience has uniformly 
connected with a white surface is incompatible 
with a black one nor does the impossibility 
arise from any defect in the simple ideas such as 



 prolegomena logica 

exists in the case of a man who can form no idea 
of a colour which he has never seen we have 
all the simple ideas or combinations of simple 
ideas which experience can give mans head and 
horses body in the one case straight lines and 
space inclosed in the other why is not the 
latter conjunction as easy to the imagination as 
the former 

that it is not so is a matter not of this or 
that theory but of psychological fact and as 
such requires explanation under any theory what 
ever in fact we may demand as a sine qua turn 
of every hypothesis concerning the character of 
human knowledge that it shall accept and account 
for this fact instead of neglecting or denying it 
only two theories can be mentioned as having 
fairly attempted to fulfil this condition the one 
is that of leibnitz who treats mathematical prin 
ciples as mere analytical judgments dependent 
on the laws of formal thought on this sup 
position the distinction between logical and 
mathematical necessity vanishes altogether but 
the solution though applicable to the general 
axioms which geometry in common with all other 
sciences tacitly or openly presupposes in so far 
as it contains reasoning at all fails when applied 
to those on which all that is especially geometrical 
depends by no mere analytical process as kant 

° opera ed erdmann p 



prolegomena logica ill 

has shewn p can the conception of not enclosing 
a space be elicited from that of two straight lines 
in this and all similar principles the predicate of 
the proposition is not developed out of but added 
to the subject 

the other and far more satisfactory solution is 
that of kant himself whatever we are compelled 
to regard as necessary must be so in consequence 
of laws not of the object but of the subject but 
there are subjective laws of the presentations of 
sense as well as of the representations of thought 
we can perceive only as permitted by the laws of 
our perceptive faculties as we can think only in 
accordance with the laws of the understanding 
if then by a law of my sensibility i am compelled 
to regard all external objects as existing in space 
any attributes which are once presented to me 
as properties of a given portion of space the 
same must necessarily be thought as existing 
in all space and at all times for to imagine a 
space in which such properties are not found 
would not be to imagine merely a different com 
bination of sensible phenomena such as continually 
takes place without any change in the laws of 
sensibility it would be to imagine myself as per 
ceiving under conditions other than those to which 
by a law of my being i am subjected the attempt 
to realize such imagination is not a new train of

 prolegomena logic a 

thinking it is the refusal to think at all it does 
not inquire what new objects may possibly be 
presented to my present faculties it requires me 
to determine how objects may appear to a being 
whose faculties are differently constituted from 
mine thought as has already been observed is 
representative and can only be exercised on objects 
presented to it it is therefore restricted by the 
conditions under which alone such presentation 
is possible if i am to exercise my thought on 
sensible objects at all i must think of such objects 
under such determinations as the conditions of my 
sensibility require 

geometrical principles cannot therefore pro 
perly be called laws of thought inasmuch as 
they do not govern every operation of the think 
ing faculty but only regulate the application of 
thought to a special class of objects but they 
are laws relative to the subjective condition of one 
portion of our intuitions those namely which are 
presented to the senses the condition of their 
presentation being space but a condition is 
discernible only in conjunction with that of which 
it is the condition space therefore and its laws 
can be made known to consciousness only on the 
occasion of an actual experience of sense hence 
the twofold character of geometrical principles 
empirical as suggested in and through an act of 
experience necessary as relating to the conditions 



prolegomena logica 

under which alone such experience is possible to 
human faculties 

the same considerations will explain another 
important feature of geometrical judgments ip 
which they represent a striking contrast to truths 
properly called empirical imagination plays its 
part in both but in the former case it determines 
in the latter it is determined by the phenomena 
given in experience the mental image which 
i can form of this or that individual possesses 
more or less of truth and reality as it represents 
with more or less accuracy the features of the 
sensible object just as the value of a portrait 
depends on the accuracy with which it represents 
the features of the original the imagination 
again may of itself form new combinations of 
attributes but these also are hypothetically re 
garded as real or fictitious according as we may 
or may not hereafter discover such combinations 
to exist in sensible objects but in geometry 
the case is reversed its propositions are primarily 

i this character of the special axioms of geometry is 
remarkably expressed in the language of aristotle for

with which may be compared the language of kant logik

the analytical and the synthetical axioms he might almost 
have anticipated kants view of the whole question

and necessarily true of objects existing in the imagin 
ation they are only secondarily and hypothetically 
true of sensible objects in so far as they conform 
to the imaginary model if there is such a thing 
in the visible world as a perfect triangle its angles 
are equal to two right angles but if there is not 
the proposition is still true of the triangle as it 
exists in my imagination and the whole of geo 
metry as a speculative science would be unaffected 
by the annihilation of every material square or 
triangle in existence whatever might become of 
its merely approximate applications to purposes of 
practical utility whereas the truths of zoology or 
botany or mineralogy are dependent entirely on 
the existence of animals or plants or minerals not 
as images within the mind but as entities without 
the cause of this distinction is manifest from what 
has been said above the truths of geometry 
though subsequent to are not consequent on ex 
perience they relate not to the empirical figures 
of body but to the figures of that space upon 
which sensible experience is dependent they 
are therefore unaffected by the destruction of the 
visible bodies and could only become fictitious by 
the annihilation of space itself but the truths of 
physical science depend upon experience alone 
they are true of the objects only as actually pre 
sented to the senses and their reality depends 
entirely on the real existence of the sensible type 
as geometry is a science of necessary truths

relating to continuous quantities or magnitudes so 
arithmetic is a science of necessary truths relating 
to discrete quantities or numbers the two sciences 
however present some important features of 
distinction almost all the truths of geometry

immediately from the intuition of space and its 
processes consist in the demonstration of a multi 
tude of dependent propositions from the combin 
ation of these axioms with analytical principles 
on the other hand the fundamental operations of 
arithmetic addition and subtraction present to 
us a vast number of synthetical judgments each 
of which however is derived immediately from 
intuition and cannot by any reasoning process be 
deduced from any of the preceding ones pure 
geometry cannot advance a step without demon 
stration and its processes are therefore all reducible 
to the syllogistic form pure arithmetic contains

and subtracting men name other operations as multiplying 
and dividing yet are they the same for multiplication is but

that reasoning takes place and the laws of syllo

tells us that two and two make four nor when 
we have gained this proposition can we in any 
way deduce from it that two and four make six 
we must have recourse in each separate case to 
the senses or the imagination and by presenting 
to the one or the other a number of individual

words whether a man who has never learned to count beyond

serves nearly the same purpose as the figure in a 
geometrical demonstration with the exception 
that in the latter case the construction is adopted 
to furnish premises to a proposed conclusion while 
in the former it gives us a judgment which we 
have no immediate purpose of applying to any 
further use 

an apparent objection which meets us at the 
outset must not be left unnoticed if the results 
of arithmetic are altogether intuitive how is it 
that they extend to cases of which sense has never 
furnished us with the occasion of judging i may 
have never seen a thousand objects of any kind 
together yet i am as fully convinced that 
 as i am that of which 
i see instances every day of my life and even if 
i have seen examples of the former as well as of 
the latter how far does the observed fact help in 
the formation of the judgment is my sight so 
acute that i can distinguish at a glance a group of 
 objects from one of can i then in any 
case be said to have seen the fact verified and if 
not how is it that i do not merely know that what 
i have seen in a single case must be true univer 
sally but even can be assured of the necessity of 
truths which i have never accurately observed in 
any actual instance 

this objection is based on a confusion of intui 

awchauung usually translated intuition should be rendered 
by envisaging 



 prolegomena logic a 

tion in general with the special presentations ol 
sight when the propositions of arithmetic are 
said to be intuitive it does not follow that their 
truth must have been observed in visible instances 
that we must have seen for example that two and 
three make five in lines or pebbles or the fingers 
of the hand it implies only that we must have 
perceived the truth of the proposition in some 
individual series it may be of visible objects it may 
be of audible sounds it may be of states of our own 
minds present to internal observation in none 
of these cases do we deal with representative con 
cepts but with individual objects presented to the 
external or internal sense 

now how as a matter of fact are arithmetical 
judgments usually formed we see inexperienced 
calculators arrive at their results by running 
through orally or mentally the several units of 
the numbers to be added together if we do not 
remember that and make as readily as that 
 and make we supply the defect by summing 
up severally c the artificial aids to 
which we have recourse in larger sums by adding 
up for instance the corresponding digits in separate 
columns are but abbreviated steps of the same 
process 

 a confusion to which kant himself has perhaps in some 
degree contributed by representing proleg § five visible 
points as the intuition of the number thus by implication 
connecting arithmetic with space rather than with time 



prolegomena logic a 

setting aside as belonging to art rather than 
science all those methods whose aim is merely to 
extend or facilitate already existing processes the 
psychological foundation of arithmetic is to be 
found in the consciousness of successive mental 
states and its earliest actual process consists 
in giving names to the several members of the 
series such a process which may be denomi 
nated natural as distinguished from artificial 
numeration would proceed steadily forward from 
one member arbitrarily selected as the starting 
point acknowledging no relation between the 
several steps beyond that of succession to its 
predecessor until the computation ceased from 
the inability of the memory to carry on the series 
such a system however limited in its practical 
results would rest on precisely the same found 
ation as the more perfect methods which art has 
supplied us and will consequently contain all the 
data required for determining the nature of the 
necessary truths of arithmetical science 

as arithmetic as well as geometry contains 
such truths it must equally be regarded as founded 
on an internal law or condition of our mental 
constitution this condition is that of time a 
condition which governs not merely our external 
perceptions but our universal consciousness of all 
that takes place within or without ourselves 
every successive modification of the conscious 
mind can be made known to us only as a change 



 prolegomena logica 

of state a change which is only possible under 
the condition of succession in time — a transition 
from an earlier to a later phase of consciousness 
of time as an absolute existence we cannot 
form any idea whatever it is made known to us 
only as the condition or form of successive states 
of consciousness to ask therefore whether 
time has any existence out of our own minds 
is in the only intelligible mode of putting the 
question to ask whether other orders of intelligent 
beings are subject to the same conditions of intel 
ligence as ourselves whether they like us are 
conscious of various mental states one succeeding 
another put in this form the question is suf 
ficiently intelligible but obviously one which we 
have no data for determining put in any other 
form it is absolutely void of meaning it contains 
not the material for thought but only a negation 
of all thinking whatever 

it might indeed be argued with some show of 
probability that the condition of successive con 
sciousness is essentially the condition of a finite 
and imperfect intelligence consequent only upon 
its very limited power of simultaneous conscious 
ness the scholastic doctrine of an eternal now 
or nunc stans so contemptuously treated by hobbes 
in this respect contains assuredly no prima facie 
absurdity the error of such speculations is of 

y vide boeth de comol phil lib v pros vi 

 it is surprising to see how nenr some of the earlier views 



prolegomena logica 

another kind it consists in mistaking the negation 
of all thought for an act of positive thinking as 
our whole personal consciousness is subject to the 
condition of successiveness we can form no positive 
notion of a different state we only know that it 
is something which we have never experienced 
the nature and attributes of an infinite intel 
ligence must be revealed to us in a manner 
accommodated to finite capacities how far the 
accommodation extends we have no means of 
determining as we cannot examine the same data 
with a different set of faculties the importance 
of this distinction between positive and negative 
thinking will be more closely examined hereafter 



on this point approached to without actually arriving at the 
doctrine of kant had the question been considered sub 
jectively as well as objectively on the psychological as well as 
on the metaphysical side the most important conclusion of 
the critical philosophy would have been anticipated when 
hobbes in his controversy with bramhall said i never 
could conceive an everabiding now he was right but be 
was wrong in supposing that this was decisive of the point at 
issue we can only conceive in thought what we have expe 
rienced in presentation and all our past presentations have 
been given under the law of succession but this does not 
enable us to decide what may be the condition of other than 
human intelligences in this respect the remark of bramhall 
is exactly to the purpose though we are not able to com 
prehend perfectly what god i yet we are able to comprehend 
perfectly what god is not that is he is not imperfect and 
therefore he is not finite keid intell powers essay iii 
ch treats the nunc stans as a contradiction which it is 
not

but to return to the question of mathematical 
necessity to construct the whole science of 
arithmetic it is only requisite that we should be 
conscious of a succession in time and should be 
able to give names to the several members of the 
series and since in every act of consciousness 
we are subject to the law of succession it is im 
possible in any form of consciousness to represent 
to ourselves the facts of arithmetic as other than 
they are to the art not to the science of 
arithmetic belong all the methods for facilitating 
calculation which imply any thing more than the 
mere idea of succession such a method and a 
powerful one is afforded by the invention of scales 
of notation in which to the idea of succession is 
added that of recurrence the series being regarded 
as commencing again from a second unit after 
proceeding continuously through a certain number 
of members ten for example as in the common 
system hence we are enabled to repeat over 
again in the second and subsequent decades the 
operations originally performed in the first and 
thus indefinitely to extend our calculus in the 
form of a continually recurring series but the 
calculus though thus rendered infinitely more 
efficacious as an instrument remains in its psy 
chological basis unaltered 

from these considerations it follows that the 
several members of an arithmetical series are 



prolegomena logica 

incapable of definition succession in time and 
the consciousness of one two three c are not 
complex notions abstracted from and after a multi 
tude of intuitions but simple immediate intuitions 
differing as far as numeration is concerned only in 
the order of their presentation they are not by 
any act of thought compounded the later from 
the earlier they cannot be resolved into any 
simpler elements of consciousness presentative or 
representative being themselves the a priori con 
ditions of consciousness in general hence the 
failure of all attempts to analyse numerical calcu 
lation as a deductive process leibnitz and sub 
sequently hegel have endeavoured to represent 
the arithmetical processes as operations of pure 
analysis assuming for example and and 
as given concepts they shew that the first may be 
ultimately analysed into the same constituent units 
as the two last and this is regarded as an expla 
nation of the whole process of addition they 
overlook the fact that in that process is not 
given but has to be determined by the addition of 
the other two numbers arithmetic is not like 
geometry a science whose definitions are genetic 
and preliminary to its processes the analysis of 
any number into its constituent units presupposes 
the whole operation which it professes to give rise 
to we may call if we please such an analysis 
definition but we must not suppose that it in any 



 prolegomena logica 

degree correspond to the definitions of geometry 
or answers the same purpose in the operations of 
the science 

the above considerations are sufficient for our 
present purpose which is to determine the psycho 
logical basis of mathematical judgments and their 
consequent special character as necessary truths 
in a distinct sense from that in which the term is 
applied to logical or physical principles mathe 
matical judgments are synthetical based on the 
universal conditions of our intuitive faculties and 
are necessary not properly speaking as laws of 
thought but because thought can only operate in 
conjunction with matter given by intuition and 
intuition cannot be emancipated from its own sub 
jective conditions hence we are compelled to 
think of our intuitions under the same laws accord 
ing to which they are invariably realized in con 
sciousness judgments of logical necessity on the 
other hand are analytical and rest on the laws of 



a writers of a very different school from that of leibnitz 
or hegel have fallen into a similar error with regard to the 
nature of arithmetical processes mr mill for example 
regards the whole science of numbers as derived from the 
common axioms concerning equality and the definitions of 
the several numbers stewart appears to have been of the 
same opinion on the contrary the whole essentials of the 
science must be in existence before the socalled definitions 
can be formed the applications of the calculus as an instru 
ment must not be confounded with its essential constituents 
as a science

thought properly so called their analytical 
character is a necessary consequence of the con 
stitution of the thinking faculty and is so far from 
being a proof of the unsoundness or frivolity of 
logical speculations that it is the strongest 
evidence of their truth and scientific value and 
leads to most important consequences both in 
logic and in psychology 

the nature of these judgments as well as of 
those distinguished as metaphysically necessary 
will be examined in the following chapters 



chapter v 

on the psychological character of metaphysical necessity 

a distinction between necessary and contingent 
matter is found somewhat out of place it is true 
but still it is found in most of the older and 
among english writers in most also of the recent 
treatises on logic the boundaries of each 
however are not in the majority of instances de 
termined with any approach to accuracy among 
the schoolmen the favourite example of a pro 
position of the highest degree of necessity was 
omne animal rationale est risibile an example con 
sistent enough with the mediaeval state of physical 
science but which in the present day will scarcely 
be allowed a higher degree of certainty than be 

 matter in this sense must not be confounded with the 
modality recognised by aristotle and by most of the modern 
german logicians the former is an understood relation 
between the terms of a proposition the form of the pro 
position being in all cases a is b and is supposed to be 
of use in determining the quantity of indefinites the latter 
is an expressed relation the form of the necessary proposition 
being a must be b and this is applicable to universal and 
particular propositions indifferently the admission of the 
latter is still a point of dispute among eminent authorities 
the admission of the former will be tolerated by no logician 
who understands the nature of his own science 



prolegomena logica 

longs to any other observed fact in the constitution 
of things an eminent modern logician gives as 
an example of a proposition in necessary matter 
all islands are surrounded by water an example 
which is only valid in so far as the predicate forms 
part of the notion of the subject and which there 
fore has no other necessity than belongs to all 
analytical judgments a necessity derived from the 
form not from the matter b the distinction itself 
though altogether out of place when thought is 
considered merely in its relation to logic is in a 
psychological point of view of considerable im 
portance the following remarks will it is hoped 
throw some light on its true character 

all analytical judgments are necessary but they 
cannot properly be said to be in necessary matter 
they are all ultimately dependent on the principles 
of identity and contradiction every a is a 
and no a is not a c principles the necessity 

b examples of this kind were indeed indiscriminately ad 
mitted by the scholastic logicians who held any proposition 
to be in necessary matter in which the predicate was part 
of the essence or necessarily joined to the essence of the 
subject but this classification though tenable perhaps in 
connection with realist metaphysics is inconsistent with an 
accurate discrimination between the matter and the form of 
thought 

c kant kritik der r v p proleg § he derives all 
analytical judgments from the principle of contradiction 
it would be more accurate to distinguish this principle from 
that of identity and to derive the negative judgments from 
the former the affirmative from the latter 



 prolegomena logic a 

of which arises solely from their form without any 
relation to this or that matter that every triangle 
has three sides arises from a mere analysis of the 
notion of a triangle as that every island is sur 
rounded by water arises from a mere analysis of 
the notion of an island this necessity is derived 
solely from the laws of formal thinking 

of synthetical judgments every statement of a 
physical fact is in contingent matter at least if 
the opposite term be used in its highest sense 
however rigidly certain phenomena may be 
deduced from the assumption of a general law of 
nature the law itself remains nothing more than 
an observed fact of which we can give no other 
explanation than that it was the will of the 
creator to constitute things in a certain manner 
for example that a body in motion under certain 
conditions of projection and attracted by a force 
varying inversely as the square of the distance 
will describe an ellipse having the centre of 
attraction in one of the foci — this is matter of 
demonstration but that the earth is such a body 
acted upon by forces of this description is matter 
of fact of which we can only say that it is so and 
that it might have been otherwise the original 
premise being thus contingent all deductions from 
it are materially contingent likewise 

the same is the case with all psychological 
judgments so far as they merely state the fact 
that our minds are constituted in this or that 



prolegomena logica 

manner but there is one remarkable difference 
between this contingency and that which is pre 
sented by physical phenomena the laws of the 
latter impose no restraint on my powers of thought 
relatively to me they are simply universally ob 
served facts there is therefore no impediment 
to my uniting in a judgment any two notions once 
formed though the corresponding objects cannot 
consistently with existing laws of nature be united 
in feet i may thus conceive a mountain moving 
or a stone floating on the water though ray expe 
rience has always presented to me the mountain as 
standing and the stone as sinking but as regards 
psychology the powers of my mind cannot b 
presented to consciousness but under one deter 
minate manifestation the only variety is found 
in the objects on which they operate i am thus 
limited in my power of forming notions at all in 
all cases where i am by mental restrictions pre 
vented from experiencing the corresponding in 
tuition i have thus a negative idea only of the 
nature of an intelligent being constituted in a 
different manner from myself though i have no 
difficulty in supposing that many such exist i 
can suppose for instance that there may exist 
beings whose knowledge of material objects is not 
gained through the medium of bodily senses or 
whose understanding has a direct power of in 
tuition but to conceive such a being is beyond 
my power conception being limited to the field 



 prolegomena logica 

of positive intuitions in another point of view 
both physical and psychological judgments may 
be called necessary as the consequence of certain 
established laws which laws however might have 
been otherwise in this sense both might be 
classified as hypotheticcdly necessary in opposition 
to another class of judgments those relating to 
human actions which as will hereafter appear 
are in the fullest sense of the term contingent 
for logical purposes however the former clas 
sification is preferable 

on the other hand mathematical judgments 
have been almost universally regarded as belong 
ing to the province of necessary matter we 
can suppose the possibility of beings existing 
whose consciousness has no relation to space or 
time at all we can suppose it possible that some 
change in our mental constitution might present 
us with the intuition of space in more than three 
dimensions this is no more than to admit the 
possible existence of intelligent creatures other 
wise constituted than ourselves and consequently 
incomprehensible by us but to suppose the

intelligible from sensible magnitude the objections of sextus 
empiricus in ancient and of hume in modern times among 
sceptics so far as they have any special relation to geometry 
as well as those of m comte and mr mill among sensational 
ists are mainly based on a confusion of these two 



prolegomena logic a 

existence of geometrical figures or arithmetical 
numbers such as those with which we are now 
acquainted is to suppose the existence of space 
and time as we are now conscious of them and 
therefore relatively to beings whose mental con 
stitution is so far similar to our own such a 
supposition therefore necessarily carries with it 
all the mathematical relations in which time and 
space as given to us are necessarily thought 
for mathematical judgments strictly relate only 
to objects of thought as existing in my mind 
not to distinct entities as existing in a certain 
relation to my mind they therefore imply no 
other existence but that of a thinking subject 
modified in a certain manner destroy this sub 
ject or change its modification and we cannot 
say as in other cases that the object may possibly 
exist still without the subject or may exist in a 
new relation to a new subject for the object exists 
only in and through that particular modification 
of the subject and on any other supposition 
is annihilated altogether it is thus impossible 
to suppose that a triangle can in relation to 
any intelligence whatever have its angles greater 
or less than two right angles or that two and two 
should not be equal to four though it is possible 
to suppose the existence of beings destitute of the 
idea of a triangle or of the number two this is 
necessary matter in the strict sense of the term a 
relation which our minds are incapable of reversing

not merely positively in our own acts of thought 
but also negatively by supposing others who can 
do so 

there is one other science which has frequently 
been supposed to share this necessity with mathe 
matics metaphysics though so far as it deals 
in merely analytical judgments it has been suf 
ficiently shewn by kant to be incapable of leading 
to any scientific results is frequently regarded as 
possessing a certain number of synthetical axioms 
which under the various names of principles of 
necessary truth fundamental laws of human 
belief and sometimes even however incorrectly 
of laws of thought have held a prominent

the present time two of these principles may 
be especially selected for examination partly on 
account of the importance attached to them by 
eminent writers and partly on account of their

lost a great handle for trifling and disputation 

 it will be urged he continues that thus 
much at least is true to wit that we take away all 
corporeal substances to this my answer is that 
if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense 
for a combination of sensible qualities such as 
extension solidity weight and the like this we 
cannot be accused of taking away but if it be 
taken in a philosophic sense for the support of 
accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed 
i acknowledge that we take it away if one may 
be said to take away that which never had any 
existence not even in the imagination 

but after berkeley came hume who applied to 
the phenomena of internal perception the same 
process of reasoning which berkeley had applied

to the external within myself he argued i am 
conscious only of impressions and ideas the 
substance called mind is a mere fiction imagined 
for the support of these as the substance called 
matter is imagined for the support of sensible 
qualities in opposition to these sceptical con 
clusions reid and his disciples appealed to the 
authority of certain universally acknowledged 
axioms distinguished as principles of common 
sense or fundamental laws of human belief of 
which we can give no other account than that 
such is our constitution and we must think accord 
ingly one of these is the principle of substance 
mentioned above 

it is necessary to speak with diffidence on a 
point disputed by philosophers of such eminence 
but if there be any truth in the psychological dis 
tinction between thought and intuition noticed 
in my first chapter it will appear that the scottish 
philosophers in endeavouring to overthrow hume 
and berkeley at once abandoned the only position 
from which an attack might have been successfully 
made on either of them separately humes philo 
sophy is not a legitimate development of berkeleys 
unless we allow that our consciousness of mind as 
well as of matter is representative only if it be true 
that neither mental nor material substance as distin 
guished from the various states and attributes of 
either is in any manner presented intuitively the

two theories must stand or fall together and this 
point is over and over again conceded by reid and 
stewart 

under this concession the appeal to a funda 
mental law of belief is insufficient such a law 
can only state the fact that we are by our consti 
tution compelled to believe in a certain relation 
between two given notions it does not explain how 
either of such notions could have entered into the 
mind in the first instance but the appeal becomes 
selfcontradictory in the hands of any one who 
admits the views of locke or of kant concerning 
the limits of the understanding either a pre

subject to which the attributes belong but of this subject

powers essay v ch it is not matter or body which i 
perceive by my senses but only extension figure colour and 
certain other qualities which the constitution of my nature 
leads me to refer to something which is extended figured

mind we are not immediately conscious of its existence 
but we are conscious of sensation thought and volition 
operations which imply the existence of something which 
feels thinks and wills stewart elements in trod part i 

m yet kant no less than eeid allows that we are not 
immediately conscious of mind but only of its phenomena 
in his hands however the concession is perfectly suicidal 
and forms the weak part of the critical philosophy the 
reader who bears this inconsistency in mind may perhaps 
find an easier solution to some of kants paralogisms and 



prolegomena logica 

sentative origin must be found for the notions of 
substance and cause or we must admit that in 
these instances the act of thought has created its 
own objects 

we are therefore compelled to ask is this 
asserted analogy between our modes of conscious 
ness in relation to matter and mind really tenable 
does it not rather appear a flat selfcontradiction 
to maintain that i am not immediately conscious 
of myself but only of my sensations or volitions 
who then is this that is conscious and how can 
i be conscious of such states as mine in this 
case it would surely be far more accurate to say 
not that i am conscious of my sensations but that 
the sensation is conscious of itself but thus worded 
the glaring absurdity of the theory would carry 
with it its own refutation n

all it can be made no clearer by description or

and comparison can furnish only faint and partial

the extravagant speculations in which metaphy

all inquiry into its character as it is given as a 
power conscious of itself that there are many

to another that of which i am directly cognisant

given in a sensible intuition the substance is 
added to them by a representative act of thought 

beyond the range of conscious beings we can 
have only a negative idea of substance the name 
is applied in relation to certain collections of sensible 
phenomena natural or artificial connected with 
each other in various ways by locomotion by 
vegetation by contributing to a common end by 
certain positions in space but here we have no 
positive notion of substance distinct from phe 
nomena i do not attribute to the billiard ball a 
consciousness of its own figure colour and motion 
but in denying consciousness i deny the only form 
in which unity and substance have been presented 
to me i have therefore no data for thinking one 
way or the other on the question some kind of 
unity between the several phenomena may exist or 
it may not but if it does exist it exists in a 
manner of which i can form no conception and if 
it does not exist my faculties do not enable me to 
detect its absence 

such an acknowledgment of the negative cha 
racter of certain supposed thoughts i e of their 
not being really thoughts at all is very different 
from scepticism it does not teach a distrust of

our faculties within their proper limits but only 
tells us that they have limits and that they cannot 
transgress them in this there is no more of 
paradox than in asserting that we cannot see a 
man or a tower at a thousand miles distance 
the fault of berkeley did not consist in doubting 
the existence of matter but in asserting its non 
existence if i cannot see a spot a thousand 
miles off i am as far as sight is concerned equally 
incompetent to assert that there is or is not a 
tower standing upon it in like manner it is 
characteristic of all mere negative notions that 
we have no direct evidence whether their supposed 
objects exist or not to maintain that matter is 
a fiction invented for the support of attributes is 
to dogmatize in negation and after all to give a 
partial solution only of the question for fictions

tell us nothing of the kind and were these our only intuitive 
faculties we should never have supposed such a subject to 
exist to refer any belief to a principle of our nature is 
insufficient unless we can at the same time psychologically

their influence on thought and language it could 
scarcely have given rise either to the extreme 
scepticism of his successor or to the strange mis 
understandings of some of his adversaries 

the conclusion to be drawn from the above 
remarks is sufficiently obvious the general 
assertion that all sensible qualities belong to a 
subject cannot with any propriety be called a 
principle of necessary truth inasmuch as it is a 
principle which may be either true or false and 
we have no means of determining which nor is 
it correct to call it a fundamental law of human 
belief if by that expression is meant any thing 
more than an assertion of the universal tendency 
of men to liken other things to themselves and to 
speak of them under forms of expression adapted 
to such likeness far beyond the point where the 
parallel fails the trite law or principle which 
connects attributes with a substance extends no 
further than to the phenomena of the personal 
consciousness which are necessarily apprehended 
as attributes of myself and this principle does 
not warrant us in asserting that the whiteness 
and roundness and hardness of the billiardball 
are attributes of the ball in the same manner as 
my thoughts and feelings and sensations are attri 
butes of me nevertheless there is a real though 
an incomplete analogy between the two cases 
which may serve in some degree to account for 
the association which has led to the apparent 



 prolegomena logica 

recognition in the universal language of mankind 
of a relation which has no warrant in our imme 
diate consciousness though bodily attributes 
are not perceived as related to a substance they 
are in all cases perceived as related to each other 
the perception by sense of any phenomenon of 
matter is necessarily accompanied by an intel 
lectual apprehension of its relations to space as 
occupying it and contained in it colour cannot 
be perceived without extension nor extension 
without solidity and solidity is not a single 
attribute but includes in its comprehension the 
three dimensions of length breadth and thick 
ness but we can analyse in language what we 
cannot analyse in consciousness and by the 
appropriation of distinct names to the related 
attributes we are enabled to speak of them apart 
though we cannot perceive them except in con 
junction this is the real distinction indicated 
by the use of concrete or abstract terms the 
round hard white body denotes the attribute as 
perceived in space the roundness and hardness 
and whiteness severally denote the same attributes 
as separated in language this real distinction 
is coupled with an association transferred from 
the personal consciousness and men speak of 
the roundness and hardness and whiteness of the

consciousness is in the other an imaginary parallel 
which cannot be positively verified by conscious 
ness though for the same reason it cannot be 
positively denied 

but though there is thus no speculative reason 
for accepting or rejecting berkeleys theory as true 
or false or for attempting to adapt to it common 
forms of speech there may in certain philosophical 
inquiries be a practical reason for accepting or 
rejecting it as convenient or inconvenient if the 
method of metaphysical research can in any degree 
be simplified by divesting it of the hypothesis of 
a substratum of sensible attributes this will be a 
sufficient reason for accepting the theory as pro 
tanto valid such simplification will not however 
be effected by taking the berkleian theory in it 
whole extent the admission of ideas as the 
immediate objects of perception whether in 
berkeleys form as entities distinct from the mind 
or in fichtes as modifications of the mind itself 
and the necessary consequence that nothing exists 
except when it is perceived is too repugnant to 
the common sense of mankind to have any ulti 
mate value in philosophy there is still room 
however for an attempt to construct a similar 
theory viewed from the objective side which 
banishing the hypothesis of a substratum shall 
regard the sensible attributes as the things them 
selves whether such a theory would offer any 
ground for constructing metaphysical science on

a surer basis or whether it would share the fate of 
preceding systems remains to be seen 

much of the above reasoning is applicable to 
the principle of causality likewise i hold a 
piece of wax to the fire and it begins to melt 
here my senses inform me only of two successive 
phenomena the proximity of the fire and the 
melting of the wax that the one is the pro 
ductive cause of the other is an addition to the 
sensible data which so far as this particular 
instance is concerned is not given but inferred 
here again it becomes necessary to inquire 
whether we shall abandon the belief in causes 
altogether whether we shall concede that thought 
alone is competent to create the notion or 
whether we can discover any intuition in which 
causality as distinct from mere succession is 
immediately presented

term with these philosophers a cause is nothing 
more than something prior to the change and 
constantly conjoined with it we give the name 
of cause says brown to the object which we 
believe to be the invariable antecedent of a par 
ticular change we give the name of effect reci 
procally to that invariable consequent and the 
relation itself when considered abstractly we 
denominate power in the object that is the invari 
able antecedent — susceptibility in the object that 
exhibits in its change the invariable consequent 
we say of fire that it has the power of melting 
metals and of metals that they are susceptible of 
fusion by fire — that fire is the cause of the fusion 
and the fusion the effect of the application of fire 
but in all this variety of words we mean nothing 
more than our belief that when a solid metal is 
subjected for a certain time to the application of 
a strong heat it will begin afterwards to exist in 
that different state which is termed liquidity— 
that in all past time in the same circumstances 
it would have exhibited the same change — and 
that it will continue to do so in the same circum 
stances in all future time 

thus far hume and brown are at one into 
the subordinate question at issue between them 
as to the origin of our belief in the uniformity of 
nature it is foreign to my present purpose to 
enter i have at present to do only with that 

 inquiry into the relation of cause and effect p

portion of the theory in which both philosophers 
are agreed — the resolution of cause into invariable 
antecedent concerning which reid remarks that 
we may learn from it that night is the cause of 
day and day the cause of night for no two 
things have more constantly followed each other 
since the beginning of the world 

in the theory of causation as above stated two 
very distinct principles are fused into one and 
the fusion is indicated by the two words inva 
riable antecedent admitting for the moment that 
causation means no more than immediate ante 
cedence in time it is obviously one thing to say 
that every event must have some antecedent or 
other and another to say that this particular 
event must always have this particular antecedent 
the latter assertion which implies the assumption 
of the uniformity of nature in her operations is 
ven granting its universal truth obviously a law 
of things and not of thought the contradictory 
of which is at any time perfectly conceivable 
there is no absurdity in the supposition whether 
it be true or not as a fact that the phenomenon 
c may at one time be preceded by a and at 
another by b the other circumstances being in 
both cases exactly alike whether such a vari 
ation actually takes place under the existing con 
stitution of the world which we inhabit is another 
question but there is certainly no difficulty in 
conceiving that in an imaginary world it may

take place this portion of the principle being 
thus excluded from the class of necessary truths 
the remaining portion will not be difficult to ex 
plain the assertion that every event must have 
some antecedent or other implies no more than 
that we cannot conceive it as standing at the 
absolute beginning of all time apart from any x 
relation to a preceding series of phenomena 
this is an obvious result of the subjection of our 
consciousness to the law of time for our con 
sciousness of time is not of time in the abstract 
but of phenomena as taking place in time and 
the law which compels us to conceive every event 
as occurring in time obviously compels us also to 
conceive it as related to some temporal antecedent 
but as thus limited the principle however 
necessary is obviously inadequate as a theory of 
causation we cannot help feeling that there is 
a deficiency even in the original theory as stated 
by hume we feel that cause implies something 
more than invariable antecedent and that reids 
instance of day and night if it does not amount 
to a philosophical refutation of the theory is at 
least a practical proof of its insufficiency the 
feeling becomes still stronger when the element 

 in thus acknowledging one element of the principle of 
causality to depend on the mental law of existence in time 
i have partially adopted the theory of sir w hamilton for 
some observations on the remainder of that theory see

of invariability itself is shewn to be an adven 
titious accretion and the original principle is 
reduced to the mere acknowledgment of a tem 
poral antecedent of some kind or other rightly 
or wrongly all men do in fact unite with the 
idea of temporal antecedence that of productive 
power and regard this addition as essential to 
the conception of a cause a belief so universal 
even if it be delusive in a portion of its extent 
can only be explained even as a delusion by 
the supposition that it has an origin in truth 
that there is such a notion as power given in 
the actual facts of consciousness however it may 
be extended in imagination beyond the data which 
suggested it 

 the philosophers of the school of reid could 
not fairly meet humes theory of causation for 
the same reason that they could not fairly meet 
his theory of substance because they denied the 
existence of an immediate consciousness of mind 
as distinguished from its several states it was 
easy for hume to shew that volition is but one 
phenomenon and motion is but another and tha 
the former is so far from being the necessary 
cause of the other that a stroke of paralysis may 
put an end even to the uniformity of the sequence 
it was also easy for him to shew that as the 
motion of the arm is not the immediate consequent 
of the volition but is separated from it by an inter 
vening nervous and muscular action of which we 



prolegomena logic a 

are unconscious the one cannot be directly given 
as produced by the other the intuition of power 
is not immediately given in the action of matter 
upon matter nor yet can it be given in the action 
of matter upon mind nor in that of mind upon 
matter for to this day we are utterly ignorant 
how matter and mind operate upon each other 
we know not how the material refractions of the 
eye are connected with the mental sensation of 
seeing nor how the determination of the will 
operates in bringing about the motion of the 
muscles we can investigate severely the phe 
nomena of matter and of mind as we can examine 
severally the constitution of the earth and the 
architecture of the heavens we seek the boundary 
line of their junction as the child chases the 
horizon only to discover that it flies as we pur 
sue it 

there is thus no alternative but either to 
abandon the inquiry after an immediate intuition 
of power or to seek for it in mind as determining 
its own modifications — a course open to those who

admit an immediate consciousness of self and to 
them only my first and only presentation of 
power or causality is thus to be found in my 
consciousness of myself as willing in every act 
of volition i am fully conscious that it is in my 
power to form the resolution or to abstain and 
this constitutes the presentative consciousness of 
free will and of power like any other simple 
idea it cannot be defined and hence the dif 
ficulty of verbally distinguishing causation from 
mere succession but every man who has been 
conscious of an act of will has been conscious of 
power therein and to one who has not been so 
conscious no verbal description can supply the 
deficiency 

here again as in the case of substance as soon 
as we advance beyond the region of consciousness 
we find ourselves in the midst of negative notions

which we can neither conceive nor affirm nor 
deny our clearest notion of efficiency is that of 
a relation between two objects similar to that 
which exists between ourselves and our volitions 
but what relation can exist between the heat of 
fire and the melting of wax similar to that between 
a conscious mind and its selfdeterminations or 
if there is nothing precisely similar can there be 
any thing in any degree analogous we cannot 
say that there is or if there is how far the analogy 
extends and how and where it fails we can form 
no positive conception of a power of this kind 
we can only say that it is something different 
from the only power of which we are intuitively 
conscious but on the other hand we are not 
warranted in denying the existence of any thing 
of the kind for denial is as much an act of 
positive thought as affirmation and a negative 
idea furnishes no data for one or the other 

the principle of causality is thus precisely 
analogous to that of substance in its origin and 
legitimate application as well as in its perversion 
the idea of power cannot legitimately be extended 
beyond the phenomena of personal consciousness 
in which it is directly manifested but the phe 
nomena of matter are thus far similar to those of 
mind that both alike are subject to the law of

preceded by other phenomena as the phenomena

of volition are preceded by a productive energy of 
the person willing the relation which is given 
in the latter alone is transferred by association to 
the former and men speak of the power of fire to

departing from the field of consciousness they

harmony which ordained that at a certain moment

each other that at the same moment fire by

itself should burn and wax by its own laws should 
melt neither affecting the other — would not all 
the perceptible phenomena be precisely the same 
as at present these suppositions may be extra 
vagant though they are supported by some of the 
most eminent names in philosophy but the mere 
possibility of making them shews that the rival 
hypothesis is not a necessary truth the various 
principles being opposed only like the vortices of 
descartes and the gravitation of newton as more 
or less plausible methods of accounting for the 
same physical phenomena 

before we can positively assert as a principle of 
necessary truth that all physical phenomena must 
have a cause we must ascertain clearly what 
meaning we attach to the word cause if we 
eliminate the notion of power which has no 
positive significance in this relation and confine 
ourselves to that of chronological succession we 
may assign three different meanings to the term 
cause and three different degrees of certainty to 
the corresponding principle if we mean no more 
than that every event must have some chrono 
logical antecedent the principle is a necessary 
truth dependent upon an original law of the human 
consciousness by which we are compelled to con 
template all phenomena as taking place in time 
if we advance a step beyond this and add to the 
notion of succession that of invariability or repe 
tition of similar phenomena under similar circum 



 prolegomena logica 

stances the principle may be stated in two different 
ways we may interpret cause to mean simply 
invariable antecedent in which case the principle 
may be expressed as follows every phenomena 
which takes place in nature is preceded by some 
other phenomenon or aggregate of phenomena b 
with which it is invariably conjoined or secondly 
regarding the invariability as one of consequence 
and not of antecedence we may enunciate the 
principle in a somewhat more complex form 
every phenomenon which takes place has among 
its immediate antecedents some one phenomenon 
or aggregate of phenomena which being repeated 
the same consequent phenomenon will invariably 
recur 

as stated in the first of the above forms the 
principle of causality is no more than an induction 
from experience and can never at highest amount 
to more than the assertion of a general fact in 
nature we are not warranted in stating prior to 
observation that the two phenomena a and b are 
so invariably connected together that nature never 

b this last limitation is necessary the cause to speak 
accurately is the sum total of the conditions whose united 
presence is followed invariably by the effect it is not any 
single phenomenon unless we can by successive experiments 
eliminate all the concomitants save one and thus shew that 
as far as the given effect is concerned they are indifferent 
this however in practice is seldom the case on this subject 
some valuable remarks will be found in mills logic book iii 
ch 



prolegomena logica 

presents and man can never produce a single 
instance of the latter without the precedence of 
the former such a conclusion may be established 
as a matter of fact by a long course of observ 
ation it may be regarded as extremely probable 
beforehand from what observation teaches us of 
the uniformity of nature in other instances but 
in these cases it is not a principle of necessary 
truth it is an inductive law or general fact in the 
constitution of nature as now established by the 
will of god it is thus and it might be otherwise 

in point of fact the principle as thus explained 
is so far from being necessary that it has not yet 
been ascertained to be true as far as observation 
has hitherto gone the same phenomenon occurs at 
different times with totally different antecedents 
thus as mr mill has observed one set of observ 
ations or experiments shews that the sun is a cause 
of heat another that friction is a cause of it others 
that percussion electricity and chemical action 
are also causes it is very possible indeed highly 
probable that further observation may hereafter 
discover some one uniform feature running through 
these several sources but this is only a probability 
supported by the analogy of nature in other in 
stances it is not a necessary law of our own minds 
compelling us prior to experience to pronounce 
that a plurality of physical causes is impossible 

the second form of the principle is less open 
to exception for though it may be a matter 



 prolegomena logica 

of question whether the same phenomenon may 
not proceed from a variety of physical causes it 
appears to be beyond all doubt that any one of 
those causes whenever it takes place will be 
adequate to the production of the effect thus 
expressed the law in question is identical with that 
belief in the universal connection of similar events 
which hume reduces to the result of association 
which his antagonists of the scottish school refer 
to an original principle of our nature while mr 
mill holds it to be itself an instance of induction 
and induction by no means of the most obvious 
kind 

none of these solutions is entirely satisfactory 
that of hume has been sufficiently refuted even 
by the disciple of his general theory brown and 
the refutation holds good whether we suppose 
with brown that the theory in question is a 
dogmatic position maintained by hume himself 
or whether with sir w hamilton we regard it 
merely as the reductio ad absurdum of the dog 
matism then in vogue that of an original prin 
ciple of our nature though true as far as it 
goes is too vague and confounds under one 
general term things which it should be the prin 
cipal object of any mental classification to dis 
tinguish there are some original principles of 
our nature of immutable obligation and there are 
others which are perpetually leading us astray 
there are some which lead us to truths which we 



prolegomena logica 

cannot reverse even in thought and there are 
others which point out only contingent and variable 
phenomena sight and hearing appetite and 
desire the law of conscience and the intuitions of 
space and time are all equally original principles 
of our nature that is we can ultimately give no 
account of them but that it has pleased our maker 
so to constitute us mr mills explanation over 
looks the fact that when the principle in question 
is found in apparent conflict with experience it is 
invariably assumed to be in the right and expe 
rience in the wrong which is not the case with 
merely inductive laws to say nothing of the 
paralogism of making the ground and principle of all 
induction itself dependent upon induction and upon 
induction only our earliest and unphilosophical 
inductions appear as often to indicate variety in 
the operations of nature as uniformity the sun 
rises and sets the tide ebbs and flows with regu 
larity but storm and calm rain and sunshine 
appear to observe no fixed order of succession 
but in any instance whatever of physical causation 
let an apparent repetition of the cause not be fol 
lowed by that of the effect and all men alike 
philosophical or unphilosophical will at once 
assert that there was some latent variety in the 
circumstances and not a change in the uniformity 
of their succession 

the principle of causality as thus exhibited 
seems to combine in one formula two separate 



 prolegomena logica 

elements the one necessary the other empirical 
that matter in every relation is subject to some 
law by virtue of which a given antecedent admits 
at any one time of only one possible consequent 
seems to be a necessary and unavoidable con 
viction that this law will be manifested by the 
production of similar phenomena on similar oc 
casions is the result of a combination of this 
necessary conviction with the experience of the 
actual evidence of law in our own world in 
those cases which are most open to observation 
i can suppose it possible that in another world 
the law may be manifested in another way ac 
cording to which the phenomena of matter may 
have no settled relations to each other but 
phenomena at one time and in one place con 
nected as cause and effect may at another time 
or in another place have no connection at all 
but even in this case i can only conceive the 
material agents as passively obeying the law of 
their organization not as enabled by their own 
caprice to obey or disobey on different occasions 
whether the perceptible results be more or less 
regular i am still compelled to believe that in 
any single instance the antecedent circumstances 
being given the consequent cannot but be deter 
mined by them in one way and in one way 
only whether a similar antecedent will on a 
future occasion be followed by a similar con 
sequent or not 



prolegomena logica 

at the same time i am not entitled to pro 
nounce a priori that matter cannot possibly 
disobey its own law though assuredly i am unable 
to conceive how it can do so and we have 
thus a remarkable parallel between the general 
law of causation as applicable to physical pheno 
mena and the psychological facts of our own 
constitution the reverse of which as was observed 
at the beginning of the present chapter may be 
supposed but cannot be conceived and this 
parallel i am inclined to think furnishes a key 
to the true character of the law if we were 
told of an instance on our own globe in which 
the repetition of exactly similar phenomena had 
apparently not been followed by the same effect 
we should without hesitation account for it on one 
of two grounds either the phenomena were not 
really exactly similar or the interposition of some 
intelligent being had prevented the natural result 
and if we were asked why these two alternatives 
alone are admissible we should probably reply 
 because matter cannot change of itself and 
probably if we were informed that in some other 
world where the laws of matter are manifested 
otherwise than by regular succession the natural 
relation had in any given instance not taken 
place we should ascribe it in like manner to 
some external intervention not to any power of 
obedience or disobedience residing in the matter 
itself whatever relation of cause and effect is 

m 



 prolegomena looica 

conceived as existing between two material phe 
nomena whether limited to a single occasion 
or repeated in orderly recurrence we find it 
impossible to attribute to the phenomena at that 
particular time any thing like selfaction or a 
choice of alternatives to determine or be deter 
mined in this way or that now why cannot 
we think of matter as acting by itself because 
power and selfdetermination have never been 
given to us save in one form that of the actions 
of the conscious self what i am to conceive 
as taking place i must conceive as taking place 
in the only manner of taking place iif which it 
has ever been presented to me this reduces 
the law of causality in one sense indeed to an 
empirical principle but to an empirical principle 
of a very peculiar character one namely in 
which it is psychologically impossible that ex 
perience should testify in more than one way 
such principles however empirical in their origin 
are coextensive in their application with the whole 
domain of thought they cannot properly speak 
ing be called inductive truths for they require 
no accumulation of physical experience the 
course of nature is thought as uniform because 
so long as nature alone is spoken of that element 
is absent which alone we can think of as origin 
ating a change intelligence and for the same 
reason so long as the several phenomena of 
nature are believed to be each under the control 



prolegomena logica 

of a separate intelligence the axiom of her uni 
formity will admit of perpetual modification the 
winds may blow north or south as suits the 
caprices of yeolus xanthus may neglect the 
laws of his periodical rise and fall to arrest the 
progress of achilles and even the steadygoing 
coachman phoebus may alter upon occasion the 
pace of his chariot to gratify the wishes of his 
roving parent 

to call the principle of causality as thus ex 
plained a law of thought would be incorrect 
we cannot think the contrary not because the 
laws of thought forbid us but because the material 
for thought is wanting thought is subject to 
two different modes of restriction firstly from 
its own laws by which it is restricted as to it 
form and secondly from the laws of intuition 
by which it is restricted as to its matter the 
restriction in the present instance is of the latter 
kind we cannot conceive a course of nature 
without causation as we cannot conceive a 
being who sees without eyes or hears without 
ears because we cannot under existing circum 
stances experience the necessary intuition but 
such things may notwithstanding exist and under 
other circumstances they might become objects 
of possible conception the laws of the process of 
conception remaining unaltered this will be 
more clearly seen hereafter when we come to treat 
of logical necessity and the laws of thought

 prolegomena logica 

the principle of causality may thus as far as 
its necessity is concerned be referred to an inter 
mediate place between the axioms of mathematics 
and the generalizations of physical science being 
contingent in some degree as compared with 
the former and necessary in some degree as 
compared with the latter it is contingent inas 
much as it relates to circumstances to which 
our experience is subjected in the present state 
of things and those circumstances might possibly 
have been different it is necessary inasmuch 
as while those circumstances remain as they are 
the conviction produced by them is unavoidable 
in thought no less than in fact the necessity 
has thus a negative not a positive origin and 
this origin suggests a practical caution as regards 
the employment of the principle our immediate 
intuition of power as has been before observed 
is to be found in the consciousness of mind as 
modifying itself the ego determining its own 
volitions that mind operates upon matter we 
are not immediately conscious it is not given 
in any intuition that the determination of the will 
ads upon the muscles of the arm though the 
motion of the latter follows the generation of the 
former hence though we are compelled to 
ascribe all change to the only power of which we 
are conscious we are unable to ascribe it in the 
only manner of operation of which we are con 
scious for purposes of scientific investigation 



prolegomena logica 

the principle is thus purely negative though it 
serves to regulate our belief we know not to 
this day and we never can know in this life how 
mind operates upon matter though we must 
believe that in some way or other it does so 
operate it is impossible therefore to construct 
deductively any system of natural philosophy 
from the principle of causality or from any other 
axiom expressing the agency of mind upon matter 
the value of such principles is purely psycho 
logical 

from the view above given of the principle of 
causality some important consequences might be 
drawn relatively to other sciences which how 
ever my present limits do not permit me to 
attempt one such remark however will i trust 
be tolerated both from the intrinsic importance 
of the question to which it relates and from its 
connection with the doctrines of an eminent 
author to whom i have been considerably in 
debted in the preceding pages if the view above 
taken be sound we are enabled to detect a fun 
damental fallacy in the argument in favour of 
necessity from the determination of the will by 
motives if every thing in nature it is argued 
must have a cause or sufficient reason the deter 
minations of the will cannot be exempted from 
this general law if i am determined by motives 

c for the argument of mr mill here alluded to see 
appendix note d 



 prolegomena logic a 

in the formation of every act of volition then 
there is something previous to such act which 
made it to be necessarily produced if i am not 
so determined there is an effect in nature without 
a cause in this argument there is a latent 
ambiguity of language as applied to physics 
the cause of a phenomenon is a certain antecedent 
fact which being repeated the phenomenon will 
recur this notion of cause is gathered from 
material phenomena and can only by an imperfect 
analogy be applied to mental in this sense 
motives addressed to the will are not causes for 
in every act of volition i am fully conscious that 
i can at this moment act in either of two ways 
and that all the antecedent phenomena being 
precisely the same i may determine one way 
today and another way tomorrow to speak 
of the determinations of the will as earned by 
phenomena in the same sense in which the fusion 
of metal is caused by fire is to give the lie to 
consciousness for the sake of theory on the 
other hand if cause be interpreted to mean an 
agent with power my only positive notion of 
cause in this sense is derived from the conscious 
ness of myself as determining not as determined 
of the power of motives upon my will conscious 
ness tells me nothing but only that the one is 
presented and the other follows not r however 
as in physics uniformly my notion of causes 
with power other than myself is derived from the 



prolegomena logica 

primary intuition of myself as a cause and cannot 
be made to react upon that intuition without the 
fallacy of deducing the known from the unknown 
of myself as necessitated by motives my imme 
diate consciousness tells me nothing it is a mere 
inference from a supposed general law of causality 
which law is itself derived from the consciousness 
of the very reverse you are conscious says the 
necessitarian of yourself as a determining cause 
therefore you must be a determined effect by 
what logic does this follow if these consi 
derations suggest a limit to the universality of the 
principle of sufficient reason so be it no prin 
ciple can consistently be allowed so ipuch uni 
versality as to overthrow the intuition from which 
it had its rise d 

another observation will not be deemed un

e it will scarcely be credited that a philosopher of hegels 
eminence should have connected a logical theory of judgment 
with the fact that the german word urtheil etymologically 
means original part such a method of philosophizing could 
hardly have been surpassed by conradus crambe or his

words taken from the operations of sensible things 
and applied to certain modes of thinking by 
which we may give some kind of guess what kind 
of notions they were and whence derived which 
filled their minds who were the first beginners of 
languages and how nature even in the naming 
of things unawares suggested to men the originals 
and principles of all their knowledge f the 
fallacy of the theory attached to this fact by 
locke himself and by home tooke has been 
fully exposed by dugald stewart but it should 
also have been observed that in point of fact the 
obligation is not entirely on one side while as 
regards attributes and phenomena the language 
of mental science has mostly been borrowed from 
that of sensation in all that relates to the notions 
of cause or force as has been well remarked by 
maine de biran the language properly belonging 
to the mental fact has been transferred by analogy 
to the physical as the basis of a theory the 
fact is of no great value but its weight such as 
it is should at least be acknowledged to bear on 
both sides of thfe question

to say a few words in reference to an objection 
which will probably have frequently suggested 
itself to those conversant with the literature of the 
subject the origin here assigned to the principle 
of causality and the same may in some degree be 
said of that of substance also may perhaps appear 
to be of too empirical a character to consist with 
the amount of universality assigned to the principle 
itself besides being in some respects at variance 
with the opinions of those philosophers to whom 
the preceding pages are mostly indebted sir 
william hamilton has remarked that if the con 
ception of active power is derived as reid asserts 
from our voluntary exertions our notion of causality 
would be of an empirical derivation and without 
the quality of universality and necessity reid 
himself in another passage admits the same thing 
 the proposition to be proved he says is not a 
contingent but a necessary proposition it is not 
that things which begin to exist commonly have a 
cause or even that they always in fact have a 
cause but that they must have a cause and 
cannot begin to exist without a cause proposi 
tions of this kind from their nature are incapable 
of proof by induction experience informs us only 
of what is or has been not of what must be and

that experience is the chronological antecedent 
of all our knowledge even of the most necessary

once adverted to in the preceding pages between 
truths or notions of which experience is the source 
and those of which it is only the occasion the

and both as regards the present question tend 
rather to darken than to illustrate the point 
may be better explained by laying aside as far as 
is possible physical imagery altogether and by 
examining separately the relation to experience of 
notions or concepts and of judgments instead of 
confounding both under the vague expression

every general concept is in one sense empirical

and there are others which according to circum

will give rise to concepts which without any great 
impropriety of language may be called native or 
a priori being such as though not coeval with 
the mind itself will certainly be formed in every 
man as he grows up and such as it was preordained 
that every man should have the latter will give 
rise to concepts which for a like reason may be 
called adventitious or a posteriori being such as may

experience of this or that individual to the 
former class belong the notions of time and space

to this class belong also the notions of seeing hear

but a necessity of which i am conscious can 
like truth and falsehood exist only in judgments 
it may be ordained by the laws of my constitution 
that i must necessarily form certain notions but 
those notions are not therefore thought by me as 
necessary the simplest form in which necessity 
can be presented to my consciousness is that of a 
judgment a must be b this character belongs 
to all such judgments as by the laws of his con 
stitution a man must form supposing him to be 
possessed of the constituent concepts 

there are certain concepts which whether 
native or adventitious in their own origin must 
when once gained necessarily be thought in con 
junction there are others which we are at liberty 
to connect or not according to circumstances 
this necessity or contingency of judgments is 
generally confounded with necessity or contin 
gency in the corresponding concepts but the fact 
is that they are not even coextensive in their 
provinces there may be thousands of men who 
never heard of a circle or its radius there is not 
one who those notions being once acquired can 
fail to see that all the radii of a circle must be 
equal to each other

certain judgments which arises from the limitation 
of our faculties and from the circumstances in 
which all men alike are placed thus by the 
laws of thought every part of any given concept

identical with itself and hence arises the logical 
necessity of all analytical judgments by the laws 
of our intuitive faculties all objects of external 
perception have a certain relation to space and 
all objects of internal perception to time and 
hence arises the mathematical necessity of geo 
metrical and arithmetical judgments again the 
limitations imposed on our intuitive faculties re 
strict us in the case of certain intuitions to one 
relation only between them and hence arises the 
psychological necessity of certain judgments of 
which we can suppose but cannot conceive the 
contrary the restriction in this case is not 
properly a law regulating acts which we can per 
form but a bar separating us from acts which we 
cannot perform none of these classes of judg

dependent not on experience alone but on expe 
rience in conjunction with certain laws and limit

there is a class of judgments which are in the 
strictest sense contingent such as relate to the 
conduct of a voluntary agent who is subject to 
no necessary restraint whatever may be his moral 
obligations 

the above remarks are not designed as an exact 
statement of the theory of any previous philo 
sopher m nor as an explanation of language which 
has been hitherto employed in describing a sup 
posed origin of our ideas they are offered only 
as expressing what i believe to be a more exact 
and accurate account than is conveyed by the 
physical analogies already mentioned by the vague 
phraseology of source and occasion or by the obscure 
notions of potential and actual consciousness they 
likewise help to distinguish what it is important 
to keep separate from each other necessity in the 
acquisition of concepts and necessity in their 
combination in judgments it is hardly correct 
for example to call mathematical notions native 
or a priori since it is by no means necessary or 
universal among mankind to form the concept of 
a circle or a triangle still less of an ellipse or a 
parabola but the judgments affirming the pro 
perties of these figures are necessary in the highest 
possible degree on the other hand the concep

biran in his th and th answer to the objections of stapfer

tion of a cause is necessary in its origin all men 
being in some degree conscious of the exertion of 
power in their voluntary acts but the necessity 
of the principle of causality as a proposition is of 
an inferior degree to that of mathematical judg 
ments the general result may be summed up as 
follows 

 judgments necessary in the first degree or 
logical and mathematical necessity these are 
dependent on the laws of our mental operations 
and their contradictions are neither conceivable 
nor supposable 

 judgments necessary in the second degree 
or psychological necessity these are dependent 
on the restrictions of our mental constitution 
and their contradictories are supposable but not 
conceivable to this class belong the principles 
of causality and of substance 

 judgments necessary in the third degree or 
physical necessity these are dependent on the 
laws of the material world and their contradictories 
are both supposable and conceivable but never 
actually true 

 judgments purely contingent where either 
contradictory may be the true or the false alter 
native such are all judgments reducible to no 
law of causation 

to this last class belong at the present moment 
many judgments on physical phenomena but here 
the contingency solely arises from our ignorance

of the law and may hereafter be removed thus 
i am certain that the sun will rise tomorrow 
but i am uncertain whether the wind will blow 
from the north or south but this only means 
that we are acquainted with the laws of the one 
phenomenon and ignorant of those of the other 
the progress of science may raise all these judg 
ments to cases of physical necessity but my 
whole consciousness assures me that my own 
voluntary acts are subject to no invariable law 
and that to dream of any amount of future science 
enabling a man to predict these as he can now 
predict an eclipse and may hereafter predict a 
change of weather is perfectly chimerical these 
last judgments are therefore in the strictest sense 
of the term contingent while those of the second 
and third class as before observed may be called 
contingent or necessary according to the different 
points of view in which they are regarded 

it only remains to point out the relation of the 
present chapter to logical science accidentally 
it may be applied to the correction of a few 
perversions of the scholastic logic such as the 
theory of demonstrative syllogisms but its essential 
connection with the science will be found in the 
different forms of conceptions and judgments 
though the notions of substance and of cause are 
obscure and negative only the processes of con 
ception and judgment in their primitive form 
proceed upon the tacit acknowledgment of the

existence of something of the kind in the act 
of conception for example different attributes are 
regarded as forming one whole by relation to a 
common substance my conception of gold for 
example is that of a yellow hard heavy body 
but the colour is perceived by the eye the hard 
ness is discerned by touch the weight is made 
known by its pressure as it lies in my hand 
when i conceive these various attributes as form 
ing one thing the gold is neither the colour nor 
the hardness nor the weight but the something 
to which all these qualities belong again having 
conceived gold as yellow and hard and heavy 
i afterwards discover it to be soluble here in 
forming the judgment gold is soluble i regard 
the attributes forming the subject and the predi 
cate as coexisting in a common substance and this 
identity of substance is expressed by the copula 
our ordinary modifications of thought and speech 
thus contain certain negative elements the notions 
attached to which no amount of reflection or 
analysis can render perfectly clear and distinct 
though they have been instinctively adopted by 
all mankind and underlie forms of speech and 
thought which are found among all nations no 
language can in these respects be constructed 
upon principles of philosophical analysis for

all the imperfections consequent on a hasty gene 
ralization from the data of personal intuition the 
logical character of these negative notions will be 
more fully explained when we come to examine 
the distinction between the matter and the form 
of thought 

a preliminary examination of the principles of 
substance and causality is also necessary before 
we can inquire into the character of the logical 
laws of thought if it were strictly accurate to 
regard the principle of causality with m cousin 
as a principle of the reason — if it were true that 
one term of the judgment that of change being 
given the mind is competent by its own act to 
add the other and assert change supposes a 
cause and that this term thus added contains 
a positive element of thought and not a mere 
negation of the existence of data for thinking — if 
this were the case the whole science of logic 
would have to be remodelled accordingly the 
reason as distinguished in kants sense from the 
understanding would become a source of specu 
lative truth its principles would assume the cha 
racter of laws of thought and logic would 
become according to m cousins conception the 
passage from psychology to ontology the process 
of pure thinking would conduct us to the science 
of pure being a logic of the reason would thus 
become a necessary complement of the logic of

the understanding and considerable portion if 
not the whole of the hegelian dialectic must be 
incorporated with the formal science of kant

instead of making logic fruitful of truths would 
make it prolific of chimeras — instead of attaining 
knowledge would aim at impossibilities has been 
one of the main objects of the preceding inquiry 



chapter vi 

on logical necessity and the laws of thought 

the result of the two preceding chapters has 
been to mark off two classes of necessary truths 
which though dependent as all such truths must 
be upon mental laws and limitations do not pro 
perly speaking exhibit the operation of laws of 
thought nor come within the province of logic 
we have now to examine the psychological cha 
racter of the laws of pure thinking and the kind 
of necessity exhibited in consequence by strictly 
logical processes the following passage from 
mr mills logic may serve to introduce the 
subject 

 this maxim the dictum de omni et nullo when 
considered as a principle of reasoning appears 
united to a system of metaphysics once indeed 
generally received but which for the last two 
centuries has been considered as finally abandoned 
though there have not been wanting in our own 
day attempts at its revival so long as what were 
termed universals were regarded as a peculiar 
kind of substances having an objective existence 
distinct from the individual objects classed under 



 prolegomena logica 

them the dictum de omni conveyed an important 
meaning because it expressed the intercommunity 
of nature which it was necessary upon that theory 
that we should suppose to exist between those 
general substances and the particular substances 
which were subordinated to them that every 
thing predicable of the universal was predicable of 
the various individuals contained under it was 
then no identical proposition but a statement of 
what was conceived as a fundamental law of the 
universe the assertion that the entire nature 
and properties of the substantia secunda formed 
part of the properties of each of the individual 
substances called by the same name that the 
properties of man for example were properties of 
all men was a proposition of real significance 
when man did not mean all men but something 
inherent in men and vastly superior to them in 
dignity now however when it is known that a 
class an universal a genus or species is not an 
entity per se but neither more nor less than the 
individual substances themselves which are placed 
in the class and that there is nothing real in the 
matter except those objects a common name 
given to them and common attributes indicated 
by the name what i should be glad to know do 
we learn by being told that whatever can be 
affirmed of a class may be affirmed of every object 
contained in the class the class is nothing but 
the objects contained in it and the dictum dejomm 



prolegomena logica 

merely amounts to the identical proposition that 
whatever is true of certain objects is true of each 
of those objects if all ratiocination were no more 
than the application of this maxim to particular 
cases the syllogism would indeed be what it has 
so often been declared to be solemn trifling the 
dictum de omni is on a par with another truth 
which in its time was also reckoned of great im 
portance whatever is is and not to be com 
pared in point of significance to the cognate 
aphorism it is impossible for the same thing to 
be and not to be since this is at the lowest 
equivalent to the logical axiom that contradictory 
propositions cannot both be true to give any 
real meaning to the dictum de omni we must con 
sider it not as an axiom but as a definition we 
must look upon it as intended to explain in a 
circuitous and paraphrastic manner the meaning 
of the word class 

i quote the above passage from a work of high 
and in many respects of deserved reputation as a 
remarkable instance of the total misconception of 
the nature and purpose of logic arising from that 
erroneous view to which i have before alluded 
which regards the aristotelian and the baconian 
organon as forming portions of the same system 
and as subservient to the same end that of physical 
investigation or the discovery of fundamental 
laws of the universe that the deductive method 

 mills logic vol i p 



 prolegomena logic a 

may be advantageously applied to purposes of 
physical inquiry is unquestionable and in this 
respect mr mill has certainly not underrated its 
value any single proposition of any syllogism or 
chain of syllogisms may thus materially contain a 
fact or a law of nature but that the fundamental 
principle on which all reasoning is supposed to 
depend can by any possibility exhibit a law of 
external nature and not a law of mind is a sup 
position which if tenable would make a science of 
logic impossible if the dictum de omni were as 
mr mill supposes formed on the hypothesis that 
universals had a distinct existence in nature apart 
from the mind that contemplates them logic might 
be entitled to rank with optics or astronomy as 
a science of the laws of this or that order of natural 
phenomena or it might perhaps aspire to the 
character of a general cosmology including these 
and other physical sciences as subordinate branches 
but it could not pretend to the slightest knowledge 
of the laws which the mind obeys in thinking and 
its principles as mere generalizations from expe 
rience could never attain to more than a physical 
necessity as the statement of certain facts in the 
existing constitution of the world 

a science is never ultimately benefited by dis 
sembling any conclusion to which its principles 
appear fairly to lead still less can it gain by 
adulterating those principles themselves with foreign 
matter borrowed from other departments in the 



prolegomena logic a 

hope of obviating the apprehended results in the 
case of logic especially it may be confidently 
asserted that nine tenths of the confusion and 
misunderstanding which still prevail concerning 
its nature and capabilities have arisen from ill 
judged attempts to invest it with an appearance of 
utility in matters alien to its province let us 
therefore look the supposed charge fairly in the 
face and ask what will be the consequences if we 
admit that the fundamental principles of pure 
thinking are as they seem to be identical or 
analytical judgments is logic thereby deter 
mined to be false or futile by no means a 
system is futile only when it aims at the solution 
of questions beyond the reach of human faculties 
and even then the prosecution of such inquiries 
is attended with an indirect benefit inasmuch as 
it is only after repeated failures that men learn to 
know the true limits of their mental powers and 
can profit by the precept ultimately enjoined by a 
critical psychology 

 tecum habita et noris quam sit tibi curta su pel lex 

it may indeed be humiliating to learn what such 
an admission necessarily implies that the under 
standing of man is not furnished with a power of 
intuition as well as of thought but only in the 

b rosenkranz in his preface to kants logic speaks severely 
but truly on this point so ist derm auch die logik hundert

 prolegomena logic a 

same way as it is humiliating to know that he 
cannot fly like a bird nor swim like a fish the 
restriction is one which the maker of mankind has 
thought fit to impose upon his creatures and 
regret it as they may they cannot escape from it 
if logic indeed supplied us with nothing but 
identical principles it would by no means follow 
that the study of it is altogether useless but in 
point of fact it does very much more viewed in 
connection with psychology it points to the im 
portant fact that these principles are laws of mind 
and this fact alone applied to the past history and 
future prospects of philosophy will give rise to a 
series of practical rules of inestimable value in the 
direction of the mental powers 

to prove then that logic is either futile or 
false it must be shewn either that it is impossible 
for a thinking being to attain to a knowledge of 
the laws by which he thinks and to test thereby 
the legitimacy of the products of thought or that 
the laws by which the human mind is actually 
governed are different from those universally 
assumed and insisted upon by logicians but if 
on these two points logic and psychology are 
found to be at one each becomes the strongest 
possible guarantee of the truth and scientific value 
of the other the laws which the logician has 
all along assumed as the basis of his system are 
now shewn to be the very ones by which from 
the actual constitution of the human mind the 



prolegomena logica 

operations of thought are regulated the con 
clusions arrived at by a critical examination of 
the mental powers are shewn to be the same laws 
of thinking which had before been accepted as 
principles from a critical examination of the mental 
products thus by the united forces of logic 
and psychology we advance a step in the most 
important of all speculative knowledge the know 
ledge of ourselves and of our capacities and so 
far is either science from being thereby proved 
futile that they become the strongest possible 
safeguard against all futile speculations by point 
ing out clearly the nature of the laws of the pure 
understanding and the exact limits within which 
they are operative 

enough has i trust been said to vindicate 
logic from the charge of frivolity whatever may 
be the conclusion concerning its principles to 
which our inquiries finally lead us but in the 
eyes of a philosopher such a vindication is wholly 
unnecessary the only question worthy of a 
liberal mind as regards the result of any investi 
gation is not is it useful but is it true how 
ever fully persuaded we may be that every specu 
lative truth has its practical advantages to require 
a foresight of such advantages before entering on 
the inquiry is to interpose the most effectual bar 
that can be devised to the progress of any know 
ledge and the attainment of any benefit the

an english philosopher who has treated of the same

prolegomena looica 

that men do not as a matter of fact reason 
consciously or unconsciously according to its 
rules that the thinking process is not governed 
by laws at all or that its laws are totally different 
from those which the logician lays down 

but it is time to examine the question itself 
which has given rise to these observations are 
the laws of thought in reality identical judg 
ments or not it may perhaps appear that the 
socalled frivolity of such judgments is the result 
of unsuspected causes having their root in the 
nature of the mind itself that the very feature 
which is selected as the especial object of contempt 
and ridicule is the strongest evidence of the truth 
and value of the principles which it characterizes 
supposing then that the act of thinking is governed 
by certain laws what might we naturally expect 
to find as the prominent feature by which such 
laws will be distinguished a new truth is in its 
very nature partial it is new only because it is 
partial — the discovery of the particular attributes 
of some particular thing or class of things in a 
psychological point of view the determination of 
the laws of thought be their character as judg 
ments what it may is as much a new truth 
as any other being the discovery of a particular 
fact in the constitution of the human mind but 

sentiment briefly and well it may be universally true 
that knowledge is power but we have to do with it not as 
power but as knowledge 



 prolegomena logic a 

when we consider the same laws logically in their 
application to the products of thought how is it 
possible for any new truth to be determined by 
them as general laws they can have no special 
relation to this object of thought rather than that 
and it is upon such special relations that the 
discovery of every new property must depend 
material knowledge arises from the observation 
of differences the essential feature of laws of 
thought must be the abstraction from all differ 
ences d a necessary law of all thinking which 
shall at the same time ascertain the definite pro 
perties of a definite class of things is a contra 
diction in terms for it is optional and therefore 
contingent whether we shall apply our thoughts 
to that particular class of things or not but if 
all men have been thinking some on this thing 
some on that but all under one code of laws what 
marvel if when their attention is called to those 
laws they should recognise them as what they 
have all along virtually acknowledged herein 
lies at once the explanation and the justification 
of the socalled frivolity of principles of this kind 
they can determine only the general attributes 
common to all objects of thought as such and 
these attributes must constitute the very ana

more absurd than that which finds fault with a 
science for accomplishing the very purpose which 
it professes to attempt and for exhibiting the very 
features which if its pretensions are well founded 
and its method sound it necessarily must exhibit 

it is a remarkable fact in the modern history of 
philosophy as regards identical judgments that 
while english philosophers taking their departure 
from the principles of locke have been unsparing 
in their expressions of scorn and censure of them 
as mere verbal trifling german philosophers 
taking their departure from the principles of kant 
have placed them at the head of all philosophy 
as the only absolute principles of truth and 
certainty yet kant as well as locke and with 
far more accuracy of discrimination perceived and 
pointed out the impossibility of constructing a 
system of philosophy upon these judgments only 
that both extremes are equally in error — that both 
arise from a crude and onesided view of a philo 
sophy not perhaps in all respects consistent with 
itself — and that the truth lies between the two is 
a natural and obvious conclusion to enter into 
the extravagancies of fichte and schelling would 
be foreign to the purposes of the present work 
but as regards the disciple of locke it may be 
observed that he has no choice but of two 
alternatives either to repudiate the attack of his 
master on frivolous propositions or to retract his 
refutation of the doctrine of innate ideas if the 



 prolegomena logic a 

principles of thought are competent to supply any 
positive addition to what is given in intuition it 
follows that the act of thought can in so far 
create its own materials this brings us back of 
necessity to the theory of innate ideas if on 
the other hand the understanding can only modify 
what is given out of the act of thought it follows 
that analytical judgments are not mere verbal 
frivolities but fundamental laws of the thinking 
faculty 

the laws of thought properly so called may 
thus be psychologically distinguished from the 
other elements of the process by the answers to 
the following questions what is the material 
which must be given prior to any act of pure 
thinking how is that material modified by 
the act of thought itself what are the 
conditions by which the understanding is bound 
iu such modification the third question will 
determine the fundamental laws of the several 
operations of conception judgment and rea 
soning 

the act of conception consists in regarding 
certain attributes as coexisting in a possible object 
of intuition it has before been remarked that 
when the object of intuition is actual i e now 
and here present an act of thought is necessary 
to distinguish it as such from other objects simul 
taneously presented this however is not pure 
conception but conception in conjunction with 



prolegomena logic a 

intuition in pure conception the attributes are 
not presented in themselves but represented by 
their signs hence the necessity in some form 
or other of language and hence the object of 
intuition in an act of pure conception is not pre 
sented as actual but represented as possible 

two preliminary conditions are thus requisite 
prior to any act of pure conception firstly 
attributes must be given which in some com 
bination or other have been presented in a former 
intuition for as thought cannot create intuition 
attributes which have never been experienced are 
not conceivable they need not indeed have 
been experienced in their present relation but 
in some relation or other thus though i have 
never seen that combination of a mans head with 
a horses body which is supposed to constitute a 
centaur yet the notion of such a conjunction 
is perfectly conceivable because both the horses 
body and the mans head have been presented in 
other combinations secondly as the attributes 
are now given in and through their signs the 
import of those signs is presupposed to be known 
a word which i cannot connect with some known 
attribute is for all purposes of thought like 
the terms of an unknown tongue pure thought 
can neither supply defects in the experience of 
things nor ignorance of the meaning of words 

d cf krug logik § 
o 



 prolegomena looica 

information on both these points is therefore 
presupposed 

these materials being given how are they dealt 
with by the act of thought and what are the 
laws and limits which govern or confine the 
operation by the act of conception the given 
attributes are combined in an unity of repre 
sentation are there then any cases in which 
certain attributes being given i am compelled to 
think them bs representing an object are there 
any cases in which i am forbidden to do so and 
are there any in which as far as thought is con 
cerned i am left at liberty to do as i please 
pure conception being concerned with possible 
objects of intuition only the first and third cases 
merge into one the actual existence of any 
object can be determined only by its actual pre 
sence in this or that intuition and even then the 
evidence extends only to its present existence now 
and here not to its necessary existence at any 
future time when it may become an object of 
thought as an object of a past intuition it has 
then a possible and representative existence only 

 as not now present in time an immediate knowledge of 
the past is impossible the past is only mediately cognisable 
in and through a present modification relative to and repre 
sentative of it as having been to speak of an immediate 
knowledge of the past involves a contradiction in adjecto 
for to know the past immediately it must be known in itself 
and to be known in itself it must be known as now existing 
but the past is just a negation of the now existent its very 



prolegomena logica 

the first law of pure thinking applicable to con 
ception is thus indicated by the negative criterion 
that there are certain attributes which we cannot 
think as coexisting in any possible objefet of in 
tuition this leads us to the wellknown principle 
of contradiction f the most general form of which 
is nothing can be a and nota or u no object 
can be thought under contradictory attributes 
but though every thing which is contradictory is 
thus inconceivable it cannot be maintained on 
the other hand that every thing which is not 
contradictory is conceivable 

but the principle of contradiction as above 
enunciated can only be applied in thought co 
ordinately with another and a positive principle 
if an object cannot be thought under contra 
dictory attributes the impossibility arises from its 
having a definite character of its own including 
one of the contradictories and excluding the other 
the universe of conceivable objects embraces 
both a and nota it is only when definitely 
conceived as the one that an object cannot be 
conceived as the other every object of thought 
as such is thus conceived by limitation and dif 
ference as having definite characteristics by 

notion therefore excludes the possibility of its being imme 
diately known sir w hamilton reuts works p 

r this law as erug has remarked logik § ought 
rather to be called the principle of noncontradiction 

• on conceivability as a test of logical possibility see sir

which it is marked off and distinguished from 
all others as being in short itself and nothing 
lse the indefinite ideas therefore corresponding 
to the general terms thing object being in 
general are not concepts as containing no dis 
tinctive attributes and the general object denoted 
by such terms is inconceivable this second law 
of thought is expressed by the principle of 
identity every a is a or every object of 
thought is conceived as itself v 

but these two laws of thought necessarily 
involve a third the object which i conceive 
is by the law of identity discerned as being 
that which it is and by the law of contradiction 
is distinguished from that which it is not but 
these two correlatives must also be regarded as 
constituting between them the universe of all that 
is conceivable for the distinction above made 
is not between two definite objects of thought 
but between the object of which i think and 
all those of which i do not think nota implies 
the exclusion of a only and of nothing else 

h cf krug logik § who contemplates the principle 
from the opposite side he is wrong however in deducing 
from it the principle of contradiction which is an inde 
pendent axiom the two have been confounded or identified 
by many eminent philosophers as leibnitz reflex sur locke 
wolf ph rat § kant logik einl vii herbart einl in 
die philosophie § hoffbauer logik § shews that the 
two principles are independent and that neither can be 
deduced from the other without a petitio principiu

and thus denotes the universe of all conceivable 
objects with that one exception this relation 
in its more general expression constitutes a third 
law of thought the principle of excluded mid 
dle every possible object is either a or nota 
these three principles of contradiction identity 
apd excluded middle constitutes the laws of 
pure thinking or of thought as thought 

another limitation must be noticed which 
though perhaps not properly an a priori law 
arising out of the nature of thought itself is at 
least an universally valid a posteriori restriction 
arising from the practical limits of our intuitive 
powers thought can only deal with such at 
tributes as have been in some manner presented 
in intuition hence in all cases where intuition 
is impossible thought is impossible likewise hence 
arises a class of practical limitations of thought 
based on the limitations of possible experience 
some of these are partial and accidental only as 
in the case of a blind man who can have no 
intuitive experience of colours but one at least 
is common to all men and so far psychologically 
if not logically necessary though as far as the 
laws of thought are concerned it is permitted to 
unite in an act of conception all attributes which 
are not contradictory of each other it is impossible 

 principium exclusi medii inter duo contradictoria for the 
history of this expression and of the law denoted by it see 
sir w hamiltons lectures on logic vol i p

in practice to go beyond a very limited number 
the number of attributes in the universe not 
logically repugnant to each other is infinite and 
the mind can therefore find no absolute limits to its 
downward progress in the formation of subordinate 
notions to arrive at a notion which shall com 
prehend within itself all conceivable compatible 
attributes and which shall therefore admit of no 
further possible limitation but that of the individual 
conditions of presence in space and time is an act 
which if not a priori selfdestructive will at least 
in practice require an infinite grasp of mind and an 
infinite length of time for its accomplishment 

hence it follows at once that a logical highest 
genus and a logical lowest species i e a notion 
so simple as to admit of no further subtraction 
and a notion so complex as to admit of no further 
addition are both inconceivable the meaning of 
these two terms in logic must not be confounded 
with that which is applicable to this or that branch 
of material science the highest genus in any 
special science is the general class comprehending 

j this and the preceding condition are sometimes given as 
the laws of homogeneity and specification see kant kritik 
der r v p ed rosenkranz krug logik § b fries 
syst der logik § i prefer to regard them as deductions 
from a higher law it may be observed that those logicians 
who insist on the law of homogeneity are not consistent in 
calling thing or object a concept begriff the third law 
joined with these two that of logical affinity or continuity is 
questionable both as regards truth and value 



prolegomena logic a 

all the objects whose properties that science in 
vestigates the different lowest species are the 
classes at which that special investigation termi 
nates in geometry for example under the 
summum genus of magnitudes in space we find 
three coordinate infimce species of triangles the 
equilateral the isosceles and the scalene the 
geometrical properties of the figures are not 
affected by any further subdivision these three 
classes are therefore lowest species in geometry 
but not in logic for of geometrical limitations 
the logician as such knows nothing in a mere 
relation of concepts the notion of an equilateral 
triangle whose sides are three feet long is a 
further subdivision of the notion of an equilateral 
triangle and out of this again we may form the 
subordinate notion an equilateral triangle whose 
sides are three feet long and divided into inches 
this process may as far as logic is concerned be 
continued ad infinitum 

the extreme limits of generalization and speci 
fication being thus inconceivable we obtain from 
these conditions two characteristics of all logical 
concepts namely that they must have both com 
prehension and extension every notion that is 
to say as a condition of its conceivability must 
contain a plurality of attributes in consequence 
of which it is capable of subordination to a higher 
notion and it must contain a limited number only 
of attributes in consequence of which lower notions 



 prolegomena logica 

may be subordinated to it this canon of con 
ceivability as we have seen is not invalidated by 
the supposed highest and lowest classes of the 
logicians which are limits never arrived at in any 
process of actual thought neither is it invalidated 
by the socalled simple ideas which according to 
the doctrine of descartes and locke are the limits 
beyond which analysis is impossible for a simple 
idea like a summum genus is by itself incon 
ceivable in every intuition it is presented as 
part of a complex object and it can in no act 
of positive thought be contemplated out of that 
onnexion whiteness and redness for example 
are given to us in combination with extension 
motion with a moving body pleasure and pain 
with a conscious subject we cannot represent 
to ourselves as a possible object of intuition a 
colour unextended k a motion without a moving 
body a feeling without a mind simple ideas are 
thus never conceived as such but only as forming 
parts of a complex object that they are inde 
finable in lockes view of definition has been 
remarked in a former chapter but this arises not 
from their forming absolutely simple concepts but 
from their being simple portions of a complex 
intuition 

from these two characteristics of all concepts 

k the error of those philosophers who suppose that colour 
can be conceived apart from extension has been noticed by 
sir w hamilton ems works p

follows their capability of definition and division 
the former being an enumeration of the higher 
notions contained in the comprehension of a given 
concept the latter an enumeration of the lower 
notions contained in its extension the manner 
however in which these two operations are com 
monly treated in logical writings manifests an utter 
confusion between the general laws of thinking as 
applicable to any matter such as they are laid 
down in pure logic and the performance of a 
special act of thought about this or that matter 
which forms a portion of this or that branch of 
applied logic the socalled logical laws of 
definition and division are merely derived from an 
analysis of the notions of the operations them 
selves — notions such as might be borrowed con 
cerning any object from the art or science to 
which it materially belongs in the given notion 
of definition as the enumeration of the parts 
comprehended in a concept it is of course implied 
that it must be adequate otherwise the parts are 
not enumerated and that it is clearer otherwise 
they are not parts and so of division substituting 
parts of extension for those of comprehension 
such an analysis furnishes no test even of the 
formal validity of any single act of division or 
definition it only takes to pieces the general 
notion of the process but it is obvious that 
any given notion borrowed from any source what 
ever may be analysed in like manner by an appli

cation of thought from the notion of weighing 
a pound of cheese it follows of course firstly that 
the whole quantity weighed must be exactly a 
pound secondly that any part of the same must 
be less than a pound thirdly that the same ounce 
must not be weighed twice over if this criterion 
be adopted a chapter on cheeseweighing has as 
good a right to be placed in logic as a chapter on 
division or definition 

the question necessary to determine the true 
logical character of these processes is not given 
the general notions of the two operations to deter 
mine by analysis what those notions imply but 
 given any particular concept how much can be 
ascertained by pure thinking concerning its relation 
to higher or lower concepts viewed in this 
light definition as a logical operation is a portion 
of the act of conception governed by the same 
laws and subject to the same limitations we can 
determine thereby nothing concerning the actual 
possession of certain attributes by certain objects 
we cannot even ascertain that objects of any kind 
really exist in nature conception being limited 
to possible objects of intuition only definition is 
confined to the analysis and separate exposition of 
the attributes contained in a given concept and 
determines not their reality but their conceivability 
its only logical laws are the principles of identity 
and contradiction the one compelling us to regard 
any given concept as identical with the sum of its

constituent parts and the other pronouncing that 
a definition which enumerates attributes directly 
or by implication incompatible with each other 
is logically selfdestructive if the attributes are 
compatible the definition is allowed as valid as 
far as logic is qualified to pronounce judgment 
for further examination it must be referred to the 
tribunal of experience the purpose of logical 
definition is thus not material accuracy but formal 
distinctness as regards the intention or comprehen 
sion of the concept 

it is obvious that the rules of definition com 
monly given in logical treatises have no value or 
significance except in extralogical applications 
to say that a definition must be adequate to the 
notion which i entertain is only to say that what 
i assign as the contents of a notion must be what 
i think to be the contents which is of course 
implied in the fact of my assigning them the rule 
acquires a material significance when interpreted 
to mean that the attributes assigned in the definition 
must exactly correspond to the characteristic fea 
tures of the object as it exists in nature but then 
to determine whether this rule is complied with 
or not is clearly beyond the province of the 
logician i may assign rational animal as an 
analysis of my notion of man but to ascertain as 

 see drobisch neue darstellung der logik § that 
analytical distinctness alone falls within the province of logic 
is shewn by kant logik einl viii 



 prolegomena looica 

a matter of fact that all men possess reason and 
that all other animals are without it is manifestly 
a question not of thought but of experience 
there is no alternative between exempting the 
logician as such from all material knowledge 
whatever and requiring from him a minute ac 
quaintance with every possible branch of human 
knowledge if he is bound to know as a matter 
of fact that men are rational and horses hinnible 
he is by the same rule bound to be conversant 
with the constitution and properties of every object 
which nature can present or art produce 

it is obvious also that logic can admit one kind 
of definition and one only the socalled nominal 
definition by synonym or etymology would require 
of the logician a material knowledge of the voca 
bulary and construction of any given language 
thus making logic a compendium of all dictionaries 
and all grammars the socalled accidental 

m in this place says archbishop whately • we are 
concerned with nominal definitions only because all that is 
requisite for the purposes of reasoning which is the proper 
province of logic is that a term shall not be used in different 
tenses a real definition of any thing belongs to the science or 
system which is employed about that thing in the sense 
in which nominal and real definition were distinguished by 
the scholastic logicians the exact reverse is the truth logic 
is concerned with real i e with notional definitions only to 
explain the meaning of particular words belongs to the 
dictionaries or grammars of particular languages but this 
is only one out of thousands of errors committed by various 
writers through confounding the thing or notion in the mind 



prolegomena logica 

definition is a logical absurdity if the notion 
homo for example is composed of the notions 
animal rationale it cannot at the same time contain 
the distinct attributes of bipes implume to use 
the same word for both combinations is simply to 
employ language equivocally it may so happen 
that all the individuals possessed of reason are also 
provided with two legs and destitute of feathers 
but this is not implied in the notion of rationality 
and cannot be elicited by any act of pure thinking 
for this reason those logicians are clearly right 
who consider the enumeration of properties or 
accidents not as a definition of notions but as a 
description of individuals but such a description 
has clearly no connection with logic but solely 
with the natural history of the object described 

division on the other hand corresponds in ono 
sense to the remaining portion of the act of con 
ception the union of the attributes in a possible 
object of intuition and is thus regulated by the 
same laws as definition but division in this sense 
of the term is not specification but individualiz 
ation and moreover pays no attention to any 
coordinate members of the same class but is solely 
occupied with the one object conceived it thus 
belongs not to symbolical but to intuitive cogni 
tion being not the mere enumeration of the 
constituent elements of a concept but the veri

imagination such an imagination is in one sense 
a division for it is impossible for me to imagine 
an individual triangle which shall be neither equi 
lateral isosceles nor scalene one of these attri 
butes therefore enters into every actual intuition 
of a triangle and thus far limits and divides the 
general notion but then the attributes added 
are not in this case contemplated as the consti 
tuents of a lower class but of a possible individual 
in like manner i cannot imagine a man of no 
colour and no stature but in adding these parti 
culars to my conception i do not think of them 
as related to any coordinate class as constituting 
a division of men into tall and short or white and 
not white i think of them only as necessary to 
test the conceivability of the generic attributes with 
which they are combined the office of division 
in this respect is to make our conceptions clear as 
that of definition is to make them distinct n 

beyond this the process of division as con 
tributing to distinctness in the extension of a con 
cept cannot be regarded as an act of pure thinking 

b a conception is clear when its object as a whole can be 
distinguished from any other it is distinct when its several 
constituent parts can be distinguished from each other the 
merit of first pointing out these characteristics of the logical 
perfection of thought belongs to leibnitz see his medka

or as solely determined by logical laws even in 
the case of dichotomy by contradiction the prin 
ciple of division must be given as an addition to 
the attributes comprehended in the concept before 
the logician can take a single step for division 
is not like definition a mental analysis of given 
materials the specific difference must be added 
to the given attributes of the genus and to gain 
this additional material it is necessary to go out 
of the act of thought to seek for new empirical 
data divide animal is a command which no 
logician as such can obey for the mere notion 
animal does not of itself suggest rational or irra 
tional any more than mortal or immortal virtuous 
or vicious or any other attributes not logically 
incompatible with the genus p the principle of 
division must be given in addition to the concept 
to be divided and when it is given the process 
thus raised from a material to a formal one has 
like definition a potential only nt an actual 
value in relation to experience if the differentia 
rational is given i can divide animal into rational 
and notrational but if the differentia mortal is 
given i can also as far as logic is concerned 
divide into mortal and immortal i must appeal 

all thought is impossible it means only that we can proceed 
to the act of thought without additional data being required

to experience and not to thought to determine 
whether one or the other of these divisions is 
actually true whether the struldbrugs of luggnagg 
or the undying fish of bowscale tarn are really 
existing animals or not every concept is poten 
tially divisible by any two given differentiae con 
tradictory of each other and both compatible with 
the genus and the laws by which the process is 
governed are firstly the principle of contradiction 
and secondly that of excluded middle by the 
first we are forbidden to think that two con 
tradictory attributes can both be present in the 
same object by the second we are forbidden to 
think that both can be absent the first tells us 
that both differentiae must be compatible with the 
genus i cannot for example divide animal into 
animate and inanimate the second tells us that 
one or the other must be found in every member 
of the genus but in what manner this is actually 
carried out whether by every existing member 
possessing one of the differentiae and none the 
other or by some possessing one and some the 
other experience alone can determine q 

it thus appears that even dichotomy by con 
tradiction is not strictly speaking a formal process 
as kant considers it r but that it is partly material 
and so far extralogical and that the material

element predominates still more according as any 
other principle of division is adopted where the 
specific differences are not contradictory so that 
each naturally suggests the other every one of 
them must be given prior to any possible act of 
formal thinking the only division of a concept 
which can be regarded as a purely logical process 
is that sometimes distinguished as determination 
which consists in the reunion of attributes pre 
viously separated by definition in a formal point 
of view therefore the arrangement of those logi 
cians who treat of definition before division is 
preferable to the inverse order adopted by aldrich 
divisionem excipit definition 

throughout the preceding remarks the presence 
of all the antecedent conditions requisite to the 
logical perfection of cognitions is presupposed it 
is taken for granted that we are prior to any act 
of conception in possession of the materials neces 
sary to complete clearness and distinctness and 
that the act of thought consists merely in eliciting 
the concept with these qualities out of the sufficient 
data and this supposition is the only one which 
can be admitted into a system of pure logic or 
into psychology in its purely logical relation the 
failure of materials for conception is precisely 
analogous to the failure of materials for reasoning

or two premises so related that no necessary con

elusion follows from them the logician is not called 
upon to remedy the deficiency he simply decides 
that the data are insufficient for reasoning at all 
in like manner if the empirical data for clear or 
distinct conception are wanting the logician as 
such can only say that the materials for the thought 
are insufficient the distinction between clear and 
obscure distinct and indistinct conceptions is as 
much out of the province of pure logic as a dis 
tinction between syllogisms whose premises neces 
sitate their conclusion and reasonings in which the 
consequence may with more or less probability be 
conjectured in conception and in judgment as 
well as in reasoning there are processes necessitated 
by the laws of thought from certain data there are 
others which are not necessitated but which may 
be hazarded with more or less risk of error the pre 
sumption in their favour amounting in some cases 
to a moral certainty and binding upon our practice 
but never reaching the height of logical necessity 
or speculative perfection the first class alone 
are recognised by pure logic and that in relation 
not merely to reasoning but to all three operations 
of thought applied logic in the kantian sense 
of the term may treat of the several practical 
imperfections of human thought which lower in 
this or that special instance the logical standard of 
perfection here we may treat of notions more 
or less obscure or confused of judgments more or

less uncertain of reasonings more or less incon 
sequent the object of the present observations 
is rather to ascertain what light may be thrown by 
psychological considerations on the purely logical 
processes and to call attention to the fact that the 
distinction between material and formal thinking 
may and ought to be consistently carried out in 
reference to all the operations of the understanding 
judgment is distinguished from conception by 
the difference of its data in conception attributes 
are givfip to be united by thought in a possible 
object to intuition in judgment concepts are 
given to be united by thought in a common object 
like conception also judgment may be considered 
either as pure or as combined with a present 
intuition pure judgments are those in which the 
given concepts are of such a character that their 
mutual relation of agreement or difference can be 
determined by an act of thought alone without 
any appeal to experience this is the case when 
the attributes comprehended in the one concept 
form either the whole or a part of those com 
prehended in the other or where some attribute 
comprehended in the one is contradictory of one 
of those comprehended in the other in the 
former case we are enabled at once by the law of 
identity to unite the two concepts in an affirmative 
judgment and in the latter by the law of contra 
diction to separate them by a negative judgment 
but this class of judgments being those commonly

 prolegomena logic a 

known as analytical or explicative may with more 
propriety be included under the head of con 
ception the affirmative analytical judgment is 
in fact nothing more than the definition complete 
or partial of the subjectnotion while the negative 
judgment expresses only the necessary condition 
of all conception which by discerning any notion 
as being that which it is necessarily excludes it 
from all that it is not 

in synthetical or ampliative judgments the act 
of thought is not sufficient to determine the 
relation of the concepts to each other without 
the accompaniment of an intuition pure or em 
pirical for example in order to form the 
judgment two straight lines cannot inclose a 
space i must not only be able to conceive sepa 
rately the two notions of a straight line and of an 
inclosing of space but i must also by the aid of 
imagination construct a representation in my mind 
of two actual straight lines and their actual 
positions in space i must perceive that these 
two straight lines are incapable of inclosing a 
space before i pronounce the universal judgment 
concerning all pairs of straight lines here the 
relation between the two concepts is presented in 
a pure or d priori intuition ie in an intuition 
containing no adventitious element external to the 
mind itself again in order to form the judgment

gold does not in itself include the attribute of

yet in this class of judgments as well as in the 
former when the necessary intuition has once 
been given the act of thought itself is governed 
by the same laws of identity and contradiction 
in pronouncing that two distinct notions are 
united in one and the same object that it is the 
gold which is heavy i unite the concepts gold 
and heavy in a complex notion comprehending 
both and denoting the union of both in a common 
object that which was before conceived as 
gold is now conceived as heavy gold whether 
the new attribute becomes part of the meaning of 
the term gold or not is of no consequence and 
this complex notion is now exhibited in the act of 
judgment as analysed into its constituent parts 
and identified with them synthetical judgments 
may thus as far as the mere act of thought is 
concerned be brought under the same law as 
analytical ones namely the principle of identity

when the judgment is affirmative and that of 
contradiction when it is negative 

another law of thought is sometimes given as 
the foundation of judgment under the name of 
the logical principle of sufficient reason this 
law which must be carefully distinguished from the 
metaphysical principle of causality is enunciated 
u every judgment must have a sufficient ground 
for its assertion v but in truth the relation of 
this principle to the act of judgment is merely 
negative it forbids us in certain cases to judge at 
all and it does no more if the judgment is 
analytical the law of identity or of contradiction 
is the sufficient reason for making it if the judg 
ment is synthetical we have previously to the given 
intuition no reason at all and accordingly we 
suspend our thought till we have referred the 
decision to the tribunal of experience the only 
logical reason for a thought of any kind is its 
relation to some other thought and this relation 
will in each case be determined by its own proper 
law the principle of sufficient reason is there 
fore no law of thought but only the statement 
that every act of thought must be governed by 
some law or other

formal it is only a derivation of the three formal laws and 
in as much as it is material it coincides with the principle 
of causality and is extralogical kant logik einleitung

contradiction as the criterion of the logical possibility of a 
judgment that of sufficient reason as the criterion of its 
logical reality but of judgments as distinguished from the 
conclusions of syllogisms the only logical reality is possibility 
directly i have ascertained two notions not to be contradictory 
to each other i have made an actual judgment of the logical 
possibility of their coexistence and to take any step beyond 
this experience is required and not logic the difference 
between problematical and assertorial judgments is extralogical 
and depends on the question whether a logical judgment is 
or is not determined by experience to be materially true

ences of opposition and conversion in all these 
the material given prior to the act of thought is 
a judgment and the process of judging from 
concepts is thus not included but presupposed 
the conclusion being always a different judgment 
either in form as regards quantity quality or 
relation which is the case in immediate conse 
quences or partially in matter which is the case 
in mediate reasoning by syllogism the common 
arrangement therefore which places immediate 
inference in the second part of logic is objection 
able 

opposition may be treated in two points of 



 see kant logik § his theory of contraposition 
affecting the modality of the judgment is untenable and 
seems to result merely from that excessive love of system 
which must bring in four forms somehow the supposed 
demonstrative character of the conclusion in contraposition 
is merely a necessity of consequence from the position of the 
premise a character which is found in all logical reasoning 
whatever 

 this order however has by no means been uniformly 
adopted by logicians aristotle treats of opposition in the 
de interpretations and of conversion in the prior analytics 
wolf separates opposition and conversion considered as 
relations between two given propositions from the processes 
of inference derivable from each the former is treated in 
connection with judgment the latter under the name of 
immediate consequence in connection with reason in g

view firstly as a relation between two given 
propositions secondly as a process of inference 
in which one proposition being given another 
may be determined in the former character it 
is merely an explanation of the meaning of certain 
logical terms in the latter it is a process of 
reasoning a deduction of one proposition as con 
clusion from another as premise and governed 
as we shall see by the same laws as the mediate 
inference the primary processes on which the 
rest may be made to depend are those of sub 
altern and contradictory opposition the former 
being grounded on the principle of identity and 
the latter on those of contradiction and excluded 
middle thus in the proposition all a is some 



b on account of this identity of law various attempts have 
been made by ingenious writers to reduce immediate con 
sequences to the mediate form thus wolf exhibits sub 
altern opposition as a syllogism with the minor premise 
 some a is a thus perversely representing the law of thought 
which governs the reasoning process in general as a part of 
the special matter given preliminary to a particular act still 
more absurd is the elaborate system which krug after a hint 
from wolf has constructed in whiih all immediate infer 
ences appear as hypothetical syllogisms a major premise 
being supplied in the form if all a is b some a is b 
the author appears to have forgotten that either this premise 
is an additional empirical truth in which case the immediate 
reasoning is not a logical process at all or it is a formal 
inference presupposing the very reasoning to which it is 
prefixed and thus begging the whole question

b an identity is stated between the whole of the 
objects thought under the concept a and a portion 
of those thought under b e the conclusion 
 therefore some a is some b proceeds on the 
principle that every part of a must be identical 
with a part of that which has been given as 
identical with all a this process resembles the 
inference in an affirmative syllogism except that 
in the latter there is given a double identity 
firstly of the middle term with a part of the 
major and secondly of the minor with a part 
of the middle the inferences of contradictory 
opposition are based on the principles of con 
tradiction and excluded middle by the former 
when one of two contradictory judgments is given 
as true we infer that the other is false and by 
the latter when one is given as false we infer 

e throughout the following pages in order to exhibit the 
law of thought more clearly in each case i have in con 
formity with the view of sir william hamilton stated the 
quantity of the predicate as well as of the subject in each 
proposition of the value of this addition to the ordinary 
logical forms i have elsewhere expressed my opinion north 
british review no i have not therefore thought it 
necessary to enter into an elaborate examination of it here 
especially as it is sufficient for my purpose to bring forward 
only those forms of reasoning universally admitted by 
logicians in quantifying the predicate in these instances 
we only express what every treatise on logic tells us to 
understand viz that the predicate of an affirmative pro 
position is not distributed i e is thought as particular 



prolegomena logic a 

that the other is true the remaining inferences 
of opposition may be reduced to combinations of 
the above 

the several processes of conversion if the 
predicate is quantified as well as the subject may 
be reduced to simple conversion only and even 
under the old system conversion per accident may 
be regarded as a combination of simple conversion 
with one of the inferences of opposition d simple 
conversion is thus the only one which it is ne 
cessary to examine this cannot properly be 
regarded as a process of judgment for either 
the converted proposition is a new judgment 
distinct from the original one or it is merely the 
same judgment expressed in different language 
in the former case it is an inference from a 
premise and consequently a process of reasoning 
in the latter there is no process of thinking at all 
but merely a change in the language by which a 
given thought is expressed the former is the 
preferable view so long as the subject and pre 
dicate of a proposition are viewed in the relation 
of whole and part whether by the inclusion of 
the subject under the extension of the predicate 

d thus aldrich analyses conversion per accident sit 
vera e ergo et ejus simpliciter conversa ergo et converse 
subalternata qu® est expositee conversa per accidens sit

 prolegomena logtca 

or of the predicate in the comprehension of the 
subject for the inversion of the relations of 
whole and part is sufficient to constitute a new 
judgment but in the system of sir w hamilton 
in which every proposition is reduced to an 
equation or rather to an identification of object 
between the two terms the latter view seems 
more accurate it being manifestly the same thing 
to identify the object thought under a with that 
of b and that thought under b with that of a 

to opposition and conversion must be added a 
third process that of the immediate consequence 
of one equipollent proposition from another 
the equipollence in some cases can only be deter 
mined materially and the consequence is then 
extralogical as in the instance cited by wolf 
titius est pater caii ergo cains est jilxus titii 
but there are other instances in which the con 
sequence is formal and determined solely by the 
laws of thought thus by the principle of contra 
diction from the premise all a is b follows the 
immediate inference no a is notb in which is 
produced a change of quality from affirmative to 
negative in this way when one predicate is

the material from the formal cases of this consequence 
and it was probably this confusion that led kant to reject 
the inference altogether

affirmed of a subject its contradictory may always 
be denied the process commonly called con 
version by contraposition is properly the simple 
conversion of this equipollent proposition 

the whole of the preceding observations clearly 
point out the view in which logic and psychology 
must coincide concerning the nature and principles 
of the syllogism the former as the science of 
the laws of pure thinking has nothing to do with 
the inferences of more or less probability furnished 
by the analogies of this or that branch of physical 
science nor even with the general constitution of 
the material world so far as it is known to us only 
empirically as a fact its only province is with 
those inferences which are necessitated by the lawn 
of thought which certain data being furnished 
we cannot but draw as consequences that the 
premises of a syllogism necessarily imply and 
contain the conclusion is so far from being an 
imperfection in logic that it is a necessary 
consequence of the supposition that thought is 
governed by laws at all and in accordance with 
this conclusion psychology teaches us that thought 
is representative and reflective not presentative 
and intuitive that having no positive operation 
beyond the field of possible experience its laws 
can only be analytical and its processes must lead 
not to the acquisition of new knowledge but to 

 this has been remarked by fries § e and recently 
by mr karslake aids to the study of logic p

the modification of the old it only remains to 
exemplify this result by applying it to the ordinary 
forms of the logical syllogism

the above examples will suffice as specimens 
of the different forms of affirmative and negative 
reasoning admitted by the three aristotelian 
figures the fourth figure might be easily sub 
jected to the same treatment but it is preferable 
to regard its moods as inverted forms of the first 
on inspection of these specimens it appears that 
the principle of identity is immediately applicable 
to affirmative moods in any figure and the prin 
ciple of contradiction to negatives in barbara 
for example the minor term all s is identical with 
a part of m and consequently with a part of that 
which is given as identical with all m namely 
some p in darapti the minor term some s is 
identical with all m and consequently with some 
p the principle immediately applicable to both 
is the axiom that what is given as identical with 
the whole or a part of any concept must be 



prolegomena looica 

identical with the whole or a part of that which 
is identical with the same concept this may be 
briefly expressed by the principle of identity 
every a is a in celarent cesare and felapton 
some or all s being given as identical with all or 
some m is distinct from every part of that which 
is distinct from all m this is briefly expressed 
by the principle of contradiction no a is nota 

these two laws govern all the moods of cate 
gorical syllogism including under them as sub 
ordinate rules the dictum de omni et nullo or the 
nearly equivalent axiom nota notes est nota ret 
ipsitis as well as the distinct axioms which have 
been framed by different logicians as rules of the 
second and third figures the process of re 
duction which is properly and necessarily adopted 
by those logicians who with aristotle and kant 
acknowledge the principle of the first figure only 
now becomes unnecessary and inconsistent inas 
much as all the syllogistic figures are exhibited as 
equally direct exemplifications of the same general 
law for the same reason the distinction adopted 
by kant between syllogisms of the understanding 
and syllogisms of the reason in addition to the 

 under the system of a quantified predicate the second 
figure admits of affirmative syllogisms which like the rest 
may be referred to the principle of identity

psychological impropriety of distinguishing two 
faculties of thought is now shewn to be logically 
untenable also the processes of immediate and 
mediate reasoning being exhibited as cognate acts 
of thought governed by the same general laws 
and differing only in their material data 

by bearing in mind what has been above said of 
the nature of thought and its laws we shall also 
be enabled to take a juster view of a process more 
or less misrepresented in the majority of logical 
treatises induction scarcely any logician has 
accurately distinguished between formal induction 
in which the given premises necessitate the con 
clusion in conformity with the laws of thought 
and material induction in which the conclusion 
may be inferred with more or less probability from 
additional data not furnished by the premises — 
between what we must know as thinkers and what 
we may know as investigators of nature by some 
logicians induction is treated as a syllogism in 
barbara with the major or minor premise suppressed 
the advocates of this view overlooking the fact 
that the suppression of either premise leaves a 
deficiency to be supplied independently of the act 
of thought and thus reduces the whole process 
from formal to material — to say nothing of the 
inversion of the reasoning as actually performed

and the destruction of all foundation for the 
syllogistic process from universals to particulars 
by making every universal premise itself a deduction 
from a higher one by others induction is repre 
sented according to the baconian view as an in 
terrogation of nature by the selection in any 
physical investigation of such phenomena as may 
indicate the existence of a general law here it is 
forgotten that the fact that nature proceeds by 
uniform laws at all is a truth altogether distinct 
from the laws of thought and if not of wholly 
empirical origin at least one which cannot be 
ascertained a priori by the pure understanding 
others again struck by the physical difficulty of 
an exhaustive enumeration of individual cases 
endeavour to effect a compromise between material 
probability and formal necessity by describing the 
instances cited as representatives or samples of their 
class as if the nature of samples and represent 
atives could be made known by an innate principle 
of the mind independently of experience even 
the wonderful acuteness of kant in all questions 
between matter and form appears to have deserted 
him here and by describing induction as a 
syllogism of the judgment furnishing a logical 
presumption of a general conclusion he not only 
encumbers the science with an extralogical pro 
cess but neglects altogether the really formal 
reasoning which it is the duty of the logician to 
take into account 

k two distinguished exceptions to this general error must

the truth is that there are two totally distinct 
processes confounded under the general name of 
induction the baconian or material induction 
proceeds on the assumption of general laws in the 
relations of physical phenomena and endeavours 
by select observations and experiments to detect 
the law in any particular case this whatever be 
its value as a general method of physical investi 
gation has no place in formal logic the aris 
totelian or formal induction proceeds on the 
assumption of general laws of thought and inquires 
into the instances in which by such laws we are 
necessitated to reason from an accumulation of 
particular instances to a general or partial rule the 
process in this case may be affirmative or negative 
and it is governed like other formal reasonings by 
the general laws of identity and contradiction 
specimens of its several forms may be exhibited as 
follows 

affirmative induction 



x y z are some b 
x y z are all a 
 all a is some b 



x y z are some b 
x y z are some a 
 some a is some b 



however be noticed aristotles account of induction in 
anal pr ii incomplete as it is in many respects lias the 
merit of adhering accurately to the formal view of the process 
and the admirable article on logic by sir w hamilton 
in no of the edinburgh review reprinted in his 
discussions exhibits for the first time the logical character 
of induction divested of its material incumbrances and formal 
perversions 



prolegomena logica 

negative induction 



x y z are not any b 
x y z are all a 
 no a is any b 



x y z are not any b 
x y z are some a 
 some a is not any b 



other moods may be added to these by varying 
the quantity of the predicate in the major premise 
by assigning in conformity with the system of sir 
w hamilton a definite quantity to the predicate 
in all affirmative propositions we are enabled to 
avoid that ambiguity of the copula which has 
hitherto been the main defect in the logical analysis 
of inductive reasoning the relation of whole 
and part between the terms of the proposition 
being thus dispensed with the subject is no longer 
represented as at one time contained under at 
another constituting its predicate but each term 
in every case is equated or identified as to its 
object with the whole or a part of the other 

under this system it is no longer necessary to 
distinguish induction from the third figure of 
syllogism as this figure with a definite predicate 
will admit of universal as well as particular con 
clusions indeed every syllogism in this figure 
in which the minor premise is collective may be 
regarded as a logical induction in this point of 
view it is manifestly governed by the same laws as 
the syllogism the affirmative moods by the prin 
ciple of identity and the negative by the principle 
of contradiction the socalled imperfect induc

tion is altogether extralogical the constituted 
whole can in thought be identified only with the 
sum total of its parts not with a few represent 
atives and without such identification no inference 
can be necessitated by the laws of thought the 
physical difficulty of adducing all the members of a 
given class is a purely material consideration like 
that of the truth of the premises in a syllogism 
and is assumed not investigated by the logician 
but without such a preliminary datum we have 
no materials for drawing an universal conclusion 
by logical induction 

thus far we have shewn the several forms of 
mediate categorical reasoning to depend on two 
necessary laws of thought the principles of 
identity and contradiction a separate examin 
ation is needed to ascertain the character of the 
hypothetical propositions and syllogisms which 
as i am inclined to think has not hitherto been 
accurately exhibited even by the best logicians 
of the formal school 

by kant and his followers the hypothetical 
proposition is described as representing a form of 
judgment essentially distinct from the categorical 
the latter being thoroughly assertorial the former 
problematical in its constituent parts assertorial 
only as regards the relation between them two 
judgments each in itself false may thus be hypo 
thetically combined into a single truth and this 
combination cannot be reduced into categorical 



prolegomena logica 

form m the hypothetical syllogism in like manner 
is a form of reasoning distinct from the categorical 
and not reducible to it being based on a different 
law of thought namely the logical principle of 
sufficient reason a ratione ad rationatum a nega 
tione rationati ad negationem rationis valet conse 
quential 

of this principle as applied to judgments i have 
before remarked that it is not a law of thought 
but only a statement of the necessity of some law 
or other as applied to syllogisms it has the same 
character it states the fact that whenever a con 
dition whether material cause of a fact or formal 
reason of a conclusion exists the conditioned fact 
or conclusion exists also thus viewed it is not 
the law of any distinct reasoning process but a 
statement of the conditions in which laws of nature 
or of thought are operative when a material 
cause exists its material effect follows and the 
phenomenon indicates a law of nature when a 
logical premise is given its logical conclusion fol 
lows and the result indicates a law of thought 
what law must in each case be determined by the 
particular features of the phenomenon or reasoning 
in question but a statement of this kind is dis 
tinguished from laws of thought properly so called 
by the fact that it cannot be expressed in a sym

bolical form we require the introduction of a 
definite notion cause reason condition or some 
thing of the kind which is a special object of 
thought not the general representative of all 
objects whatever the principle in question is 
thus only a statement of the peculiar character 
of certain matters about which we may think and 
not a law of the form of thought in general 

it is obvious that the relation of premises and con 
clusion in a syllogism may like any other relation of 
condition and conditioned be expressed in the form 
of a hypothetical proposition if all a is b and 
all c is a then all c is b and the actual asser 
tion of the truth of these premises will furnish at 
once a socalled hypothetical syllogism but all 
a is b and all c is a therefore all c is b this 
was observed by fries who hence rightly maintains 
that analytical hypothetical judgments are formal 
syllogisms it is strange that after this he 
should not have gone a step further and discovered 
that synthetical hypothetical judgments are asser 
tions of material consequences the judgment if 
a is b c is d asserts the existence of a conse 
quence necessitated by laws other than those of 
thought and consequently out of the province of 
logic the addition of a minor premise and con 
clusion in the socalled hypothetical syllogism is 
merely the assertion that this general material 
consequence is verified in a particular case 

system der logik § 



prolegomena logica 

the distinction so much insisted on by the 
kantians of the problematical character of the two 
members of a hypothetical judgment is like the 
whole kantian doctrine of modality of no conse 
quence in formal logic all formal thinking is 
as regards the material character of its objects 
problematical only formal conception pronounces 
that certain objects of thought may possibly exist 
leaving their actual existence to be determined by 
experience formal judgment decides on the 
possible coexistence of certain concepts and formal 
reasoning on the truth of a conclusion subject to 
the hypothesis of the truth of its premises 

to state that this hypothesis is in a certain in 
stance true adds nothing to the logical part of the 
reasoning but only verifies the empirical prelimi 
naries which the logician in every case assumes as 
given to exhibit a formal consequence hypo 
thetically is only a needless reassertion of the 
existence of data which the act of thought pre 
supposes to exhibit a material consequence 
hypothetically is not to make it formal but only 
to state that in a certain given instance a conse 
quence not cognisable by logic takes place the 
sequence of c is d from a is b is not one 
whit more logical than it was before it is only 
stated to take place materially in the present case 

the omission of hypothetical syllogisms has 
frequently been blamed as a defect in aristotles 
organon and his french translator takes some 



 prolegomena logica 

fruitless pains to strain his text in order to make 
out that he does in fact treat of them if there 
isany truth in the preceding observations it will 
follow that aristotle understood the limits of logic 
letter than his critics and that his translator had 
letter have allowed the omission as a merit than 
hrye attempted to deny it as a fault when the 
hypothetical proposition states a formal conse 
 i lie nee the reasoning grounded upon it may always 
be reduced to categorical when it states a ma 
terial consequence it states what the logician as 
such cannot take into account aristotle is there 
fore quite right in saying that in this case the 
conclusion is not proved but conceded syllogism 
may be employed as a logical proof of the ante 
cedent the consequent is admitted to follow on 
grounds which the logician as such does not 
investigate but which may be warranted by the 
principles of this or that material science 

the true character of hypothetical reasoning is 
lost sight of in the examples commonly selected by 
logicians which have for their subject a proper 
name and indicate not a general relation of reason 
and consequent between two notions but certain 
accidental circumstances in the history of an indi 
vidual the adoption of this type has led to the 
logical anomaly that the propositions of a hypo

thetical syllogism are generally stated without any 
designate quantity whereas it is obvious that 
wherever concepts are compared together in any 
form of reasonings two distinct conclusions may 
follow according to the quantity assigned for 
example to the premise if men are wise they 
will consult their permanent interests we may 
supply two minors and conclusions in the con 
structive form according as we affirm the ante 
cedent of all men or of some it thus becomes 
necessary to distinguish between two different 
kinds of apparent hypothetical syllogisms those in 
which the inference is from a general hypothesis to 
all or some of its special instances and those in 
which a relation between two individual facts is 
assumed as a hypothesis leading to a singular 
conclusion the former contain a general relation 
of determining and determined notion which may 
always be expressed in three terms the occasional 
employment of four being only an accidental variety 
of language thus the general assertion if any 
country is justly governed the people are happy 
is equivalent to if any country is justly governed 
it has happy people this we may apply to 
special instances all countries some countries or 
this country being asserted to be justly governed 
and this is properly hypothetical reasoning the 
latter denote only a material connection between 
two single facts either of which may to certain 
minds possessed of certain additional knowledge 



 prolegomena logic a 

be an indication of the other but the true ground 
of the inference is contained in this additional 
knowledge and not in the mere hypothetical 
coupling of the facts by a conjunction this is 
not hypothetical reasoning i e it is not reason 
ing from the hypothesis but from other circum 
stances not mentioned in the hypothesis at all 

it thus appears that the only hypothetical judg 
ment which can be employed as the real major 
premise of a syllogism may be expressed in the 
form if any a is b it is c where a b and c 

r this may be made clearer by an example the following 
is cited by fries as an instance of a hypothetical proposition 
not reducible to categorical form if caius is free from 
business he is writing poetry this may be interpreted to 
mean either generally whenever caius is disengaged he 
writes poetry or specially if he is now disengaged he is 
now writing poetry under the former interpretation it is 
a general hypothesis which may be applied as a major 
premise to particular instances but in this case the true 
form of the reasoning is all times when caius is disengaged 
are times when he writes poetry and the present is such a 
time under the latter interpretation it is one of the cases of 
a material connection of two facts mentioned in the text now 
in this last case it is obvious that the inference is really 
made not from the hypothesis but from some circumstance 
known to the reasoner but not appearing in the proposition 
any man being asked why do you infer that caius being 
now disengaged is writing poetry would reply because 
he told me he should do so or something of the kind 
assuredly he would never dream of replying because if he 
is now disengaged he is writing in this case then he does 
not reason from the hypothesis and the expressed propositions 
do not compose a syllogism

excluded middle

 no c can be both thus viewed it is in reality 
a complex proposition containing two distinct 
assertions each of which may be the ground of

two opposite laws surely it is essential to all 
clear thinking that the two should be separated 
from each other and not confounded under one

biassed in his examination of logical processes by an almost

theory which deduced the three ideas of pure reason from 
the three kinds of dialectical syllogism

of logical science are not to be lightly regarded nor 
hastily departed from even if the views here 
advanced should be found on examination to be 
less tenable than the author believes them to be 
they will not have been without their use if by 
calling the attention of others to one or two of 
the weaker defences of the received doctrines of 
formal logic they should indirectly lead to a 
more satisfactory vindication of the positions as 
sailed 

it only remains to sum up as briefly as possible 
the results of the present chapter formal or 
logical necessity is dependent on one negative 
condition and on three positive laws the 
negative condition or sine qua non of thought in 
general is contained in the principle of sufficient 
reason which however in this relation belongs 
to psychology and not to logic being only a 
general statement of the conditions under which 
in the existing constitution of mans mind thought 
is possible — its dependence that is to say on a 
higher thought or on a fact of intuition the 
three positive laws or fundamental principles 
assumed by logic as regulating all its actual 
processes are those of identity of contradiction 
and of excluded middle the last however 
operating in most cases in subordination to the 
other two these three are the highest and 
simplest forms of identical judgments to one of 
which all analytical thinking may ultimately be 



prolegomena logica 

referred and all pure thinking may be shewn on 
psychological grounds to be of a strictly analytical 
character the necessity arising from these laws 
is that of the harmony of thought with itself — of 
its conformity to its own ruling principles as the 
forms of necessity noticed in the previous chapters 
were those arising from the relation of thought to 
the laws and conditions of intuition — the requisite 
harmony of the several mental faculties one with 
another these two harmonies constitute respec 
tively formal and material truth truth relatively 
to man cannot be defined as consisting in the con 
formity of knowledge with its object for to man 
the object itself exists only as it is known by one 
faculty or another material truth consists rather 
in the conformity of the object as represented in 
thought with the object as presented in intuition 
and of this no general law or criterion can be 
given its essence consisting in its adapting itself 
in every case to the diversities of this or that 
special presentation but logical truth which 
consists in the conformity of thought to its own 
laws can be submitted to those laws as general 
and sufficient criteria criteria however not of 
the real and existent but of the thinkable and 
possible of actual truth it furnishes one element 
only which becomes truth or not in combination

to be in conformity or at variance with the co 
ordinate decisions of experience by the same

criteria we shall also be able to determine the 
logical or extralogical character of any portion of 
the contents of existing treatises on the science 
according as it is a deduction of pure thinking 
from given materials or a mixed process com 
bining the act of thought with the acquisition of 
further empirical data on the distinction esta 
blished between material and formal thinking 
some further observations will be made in the 
next chapter 



chapter vii 

on trb matter and form of thought 

the distinction adopted between matter and 
form in common language relatively to works of 
art will serve to illustrate the character of the 
corresponding distinction in thought the term 
matter is usually applied to whatever is given to 
the artist and consequently as given does not 
come within the province of the art itself to supply 
the form is that which is given in and through 
the proper operation of the art in sculpture for 
example the matter is the marble in its rough 
state as given to the sculptor the form is that 
which the sculptor in the exercise of his art com 
municates to it the distinction between matter 
and form in any mental operation is analogous to 
this the former includes all that is given to the 
latter all that is given by the operation in the 
division of notions for example whether performed 
by an act of pure thinking or not the generic 
notion is that given to be divided the addition of 

 see fries system der logik § his division cor 
responds to the above though based on a somewhat different 
principle 

r 



 prolegomena logic a 

the difference in the act of division constitutes the 
species and accordingly genus is frequently 
designated by logicians the material difference the 
formal part of the species so likewise in any 
operation of pure thinking the matter will include all 
that is given to and out of the thought the form 
is what is conveyed in and by the thinking act itself 
the same analogy may be carried on in relation 
to what are called material and formal processes 
of thinking it may happen on certain occasions 
that the marble given to the sculptor is insufficient 
for the completion of the statue it becomes 
necessary therefore to suspend the artistic pro 
cess itself in order to obtain additional material 
and this provision of new material the artist does 
not undertake purely as a sculptor so in relation 
to any process of thinking the empirical data 
requisite for an act of conception judgment or 
reasoning may be insufficient and require the 
addition of fresh material not furnished by the 
mere act of thinking the operation in this case 
is one of mixed or material thinking ie of thinking 
preceded by an appeal to experience for the pro 
vision of further data and this appeal is no part 
of the duty of the logician as such whereas if 
the materials originally given are alone sufficient to 
necessitate in obedience to the laws of thought 
an act of conception judgment or reasoning the 
process is properly distinguished as one of pure or 
formal thinking 



prolegomena logica 

notwithstanding this analogy it is in many 
respects important that the matter and form of 
a thought should not be confounded with material 
and formal thinking respectively thinking is not 
always formal because its product has form nor 
does the presence of a form in the antecedent of 
thought always necessitate a formal process in 
consequence the sculptor to continue our image 
may ultimately complete his work with all the 
form and finish of art it does not therefore follow 
that all his material must have been given to him 
at once in the first instance or he may have 
carved with exactness one subordinate figure of 
a group it does not therefore follow that his 
material is sufficient to enable him to complete 
the whole the present chapter is intended to 
point out more clearly the distinction and re 
lation between the form of thought and formal 
thinking 

the antithesis of matter and form — the objective 
and the subjective — the variable and the permanent 
— the contingent and the necessary runs through 
all the phenomena of consciousness the mani 
fold elements presented by any object of conscious 
ness constitute the matter the relations which 
the mind acting by its own laws institutes between 
the several elements as it combines them into an 
object constitute the form b in this point of 
view space and time are called by kant the 

b see kant kritik der r v p ed rosenkranz 



 prolegomena logic a 

forms of the sensibility in general external or 
internal the objects of the former being neces 
sarily regarded by the mind as lying out of our 
selves in space the objects of the latter as suc 
ceeding one another in time these may thus 
be regarded as the subjective conditions under 
which sensibility in general is possible the same 
antithesis may be carried through those special 
acts of consciousness in which the understanding 
operates whether in conjunction with the pre 
sentative faculties as in an act of mixed thinking 
or representatively as in pure thinking a savage 
to adopt an illustration of kants sees a house in 
the distance not knowing what it is it is thus 
present to him only as an intuition in space 
but the very same complex phenomenon is pre 
sented to a man who knows it to be a building 
designed for the habitation of men to the same 
sensible data the understanding now adds its own 
contribution by which the several presentations 
of sense are combined into one whole under the 
general notion of a house the sensible attributes 
here constitute the matter their union in a concept 
is the form 

in thought as in intuition there is thus a 
variable and a permanent an objective and a sub 
jective element a matter given to the thinker 
a form communicated by the thinking act in 
respect of the matter concepts differ one from 
c logik einleitung v 



prolegomena logica 

another as being composed of this or that variety 
of given attributes in respect of the form all agree 
as being a collection of attributes constituting an 
object the universal conditions under which 
attributes are conceived in this relation have been 
pointed out in the last chapter as the principles 
of identity contradiction and excluded middle 
from these three laws we may deduce with some 
amendment the forms which have been regarded 
by logical writers as distinctive of the concept 
pjjpper the concept is necessarily conceived as 
one as one out of many and as constituting with the 
many an universe of all that is conceivable from 
the last of these three conditions it follows that 
the concept must possess a generic or universal 
feature by which it is characterized as a concept 
in general or a member of the conceivable 
universe from the second it follows that it 
must also possess a differential or peculiar feature 
by which it is distinguished from all others and 
from the first it follows that these two features 
must be united in a single whole hence every 
concept as such must possess in some degree the 
attributes of distinctness as having complex con 
tents of clearness as being by one portion of its 
contents distinguishable from other notions and 

d see kant logik y § fries system der loyik § 
the former places the form of a concept in its universality 
the latter adopts the same view subdividing universality into 
extension and comprehension 



 prolegomena logic a 

of relation to a possible object of intuition inasmuch 
as the unity of a complex notion depends not on 
a mere juxtaposition of terms but upon its being 
the representative of one object these three 
forms may be otherwise denominated for the 
difference is merely verbal comprefiension limit 
ation and extension as having complex contents 
every concept comprehends certain attributes as 
distinguishable from others it is limited by its 
specific difference and as representative of a 
class of possible objects it has a certain field over 
which it is extended the forms of the concept 
proper may thus be indifferently enumerated as 
distinctness clearness and relation to an object 
or as comprehension limitation and extension 

the matter and form of judgments may be dis 
tinguished in the same manner as those of concepts 
omitting those judgments which involve merely 
the enumeration of the attributes comprehended 
in a concept the analytical or explicative judg 
ments of kant which may be more properly 
classed as acts of conception and confining our 
selves to those in which the contents of the given 
concepts are distinct from each other the syn 
thetical or ampliative judgments of kant we may

distinguish as before between the preexisting 
materials which must be given before the act of 
judging takes place and the additions contributed 
by the act itself 

thus to take an example adduced in a former 
chapter if i poise a piece of gold in my hand in 
order to ascertain whether it is heavy the presented 
phenomena belong to distinct acts of sensation 
the evidence of sight attests the presence of a 
round yellow shining body the evidence of 
touch or rather of muscular pressure attests its 
weight to unite these attributes as belonging to 
one and the same thing is an act not of sensation 
but of thought the mere sensation aided by the 
concepts presents us with three things — the body 
which is seen the pressure which is felt and a 
certain temporal and local juxtaposition of the 
two to combine the presented attributes as 
belonging to one thing — to pronounce that it is 
the gold which is heavy is an act of thought 
constituting a judgment here then we have 
one form of the judgment expressed in the copula 
 gold is heavy this indicates the identification 
of two concepts as related to a common object 
an identification usually known as the quality of 
the judgment 

the same is the case with the quantity of 
judgments i see a number of balls lying on a 
table and pronounce at once that they are all 
white i see another collection and assert in like 



 prolegomena logic a 

manner that some are white and some black 
here the senses even when aided by the concepts 
in distinguishing the balls as such yet present to 
us only individual objects this this and this 
are within their province but they know nothing 
of au or sorte it is by an act of thought that 
the several individuals are regarded as constituting 
a whole and a judgment pronounced concerning 
that whole or a portion of it 

a third form of the judgment as indeed of all 
thought is limitation in predicating one notion 
of another i at the same time necessarily exclude 
every thing to which that predicate is opposed 
and thereby limit the subject to one alone of those 
contradictory determinations which make up the 
universe of thought in asserting for example 
that gold is heavy i as much exclude it from the 
class of imponderables as i include it in that of 
bodies possessing weight the canon that predi 
cation is limitation is now indeed generally admitted 
as an axiom in philosophy f and the various 
metaphysical systems of modern germany since 
the days of kant may be briefly described as so 
many attempts to evade the consequences of this 
principle by constructing a philosophy of the

unlimited on a basis independent of logical 
predication 

the two forms of quantity and quality are 
generally recognised by logicians of the school of 
kant to these are added two others relation 
and modality the former of thes€ includes the 
three subdivisions of categorical hypothetical 
and disjunctive and is necessarily included among 
the forms of thought by those who adopt kants 
theory of the nature of these three kinds of pro 
positions but the view which has been taken of 
these in the last chapter precludes the admission 
of relation as a distinct form from quantity and 
quality disjunctive judgments have there been 
treated as reducible to categorical forms and 
hypothetical as containing not a judgment 
properly speaking but a consequence formal or 
material in this case the relation is not between 
the different parts of a single judgment but be 
tween two judgments one dependent on the other 
the judgment proper being thus confined to the 
categorical form only relation becomes only a 
general expression for the connection of subject 
and predicate under certain conditions of quantity 
and quality and thus is not a special form of 
judgment but a term equivalent to form in 
general 

as regards modality judgments according to 
kant are of three kinds problematical assertorial 
and apodeictical the first are accompanied by 



 prolegomena logica 

a consciousness of the bare possibility of the 
judgment the second by a consciousness of 
its reality the third by a consciousness of its 
necessity modality is thus dependent on the 
manner in which a certain relation between two 
concepts is maintained and may vary according to 
the state of different minds the given concepts 
and consequently the matter of the judgment 
remaining unaltered these grounds are fully 
sufficient to establish modality in the extent to 
which it is acknowledged by kant and by aristotle h 
as in a psychological point of view belonging to 
the form not to the matter of judgment it is 
conveyed in the act of judging not given in 
the preliminary materials and affects the copula 
not the predicate but the forms cognisable by 
psychology must not be confounded with the 
forms cognisable by logic the latter science is

alone or the predicate alone not the relation between 
the two 



prolegomena looica 

not concerned as is sometimes maintained with 
the forma of thought in general but only with 
the forms of thought as related to pure or formal 
thinking the meaning of this limitation will 
appear more clearly in the sequel in this point 
of view modality stands on a very different footing 
from quantity and quality in cases where a 
modal conclusion is drawn from modal premises 
it is only the form of the conclusion as a judgment 
that differs from that of the pure syllogism its 
relation to the premises as a conclusion from them 
consequently the entire form of the reasoning is 
the same in both whereas by the substitution 
of a negative premise for an affirmative or of 
a particular for an universal the conclusiveness 
of the premises as necessitating a consequence 
and hence the whole form of the reasoning will 
in most cases vanish altogether for this reason 
modality though psychologically a form of judg 
ment is not one of those forms that properly fall 
within the province of logic this will be made 
clearer when we come to treat of the matter and 
form of syllogisms 

as conception furnishes the material for an act of 
judgment so judgment furnishes the material for 
an act of reasoning the matter of the inference 
consists in the several propositions of which it is 

 on the disputed question of the relation of modals to 
logic some further remarks will he found in the appendix 
note h 



 prolegomena logic a 

composed and which vary in every different in 
stance its form appears in the manner in which 
those propositions are invariably thought as con 
nected together as premises and conclusion this 
connection consists in the recognition of a relation 
of identity or contradiction between the terms as 
given in the antecedent and those connected by 
the act of reasoning in the consequent the 
forms of the syllogism may thus be determined 
by the following question given two judgments 
no matter what may be their material signi 
fication what relations must exist between them 
to warrant us in inferring a third judgment as 
their consequent 

in the first place the premises and conclusion 
must stand to each other in the relation of con 
dition and conditioned as the predicate of a 
judgment limits and determines the subject so 
the premises of a syllogism must limit and deter 
mine the conclusion limitation is thus a form 
of reasoning as of all thinking the act of reason 
ing being such as to determine the mind to one 
actual conclusion out of two contradictory possi 
bilities 

in the second place since the terms of the 
conclusion are not compared together directly 
but through the medium of a third it is neces 
sary that this third concept should be compared 
with each of the others this comparison as 
we have seen in the last chapter results in a 



prolegomena logica 

relation either of identity or contradiction the 
objects denoted by the two concepts being pro 
nounced identical when the premise is affirmative 
and contradictory when it is negative and a 
similar relation being consequently inferred to 
exist between the concepts compared together 
in the conclusion the forms which the syllo 
gism exhibits in these relations are those of mood 
and figure affirmative or negative which shew 
us what relations of identity or contradiction in 
the premises of a syllogism may legitimately 
determine a similar relation in the conclusion 

inferences as well as judgments are in some 
cases the result of an act of mixed thinking of 
reasoning that is in conjunction with an appeal 
to experience this is sometimes distinguished 
by logicians as material consequence the strictly 
logical operation being designated formal in the 
earlier portion of the present chapter it has been 
necessary to avoid this nomenclature the object 
having been to shew that in every act of thought 
pure or mixed the product exhibits the distinct 
features of a matter given to and a form given by 
the thinker the matter and form of thought 
are thus by no means coextensive with material 
and formal thinking and it becomes therefore 
necessary to examine separately the propriety of 
these last expressions and to determine what is 
the exact sense in which logic is defined to be a 
formal science 



 prolegomena lica 

the distinction between formal and material or 
as for the present it is better to term them between 
pure and mixed thinking has not in general been 
consistently followed out by logicians they have 
allowed the existence of material consequences in 
which the conclusion does not follow from the 
given premises but requires additional data from 
experience and these they have rightly regarded 
as extralogical but they have not observed that 
the same distinction is applicable to apprehension 
and judgment as well as to reasoning that there 
are pure and mixed concepts and judgments as 
well as pure and mixed reasonings and that in 
every case the province of logic is with the first 
only in consequence of this the province of 
logic has been by some too much widened and 
by others too much narrowed on the one side 
we are told that it can remedy indistinctness of 
apprehension and falsity of judgment — a pretension 
which announced without limitation is perfectly 
absurd and on the other side it has been described 
as concerned with the operation of reasoning only 
apprehension and judgment being considered only 
in subordination to this neither view has been 
consistently carried out the advocates of the 
former ought to have included within the province 
of logic induction analogy and the whole field 
of probable reasoning while the advocates of the 
latter ought to have extended the signification of 
of the term reasoning so as to include those forms 



prolegomena looica 

of pure thinking which are governed by the same 
laws as the formal syllogism 

it would be more correct to distinguish with 
regard to all the three operations of the under 
standing between those errors which arise from a 
defect in the thought itself and those which arise 
from a defect in the corresponding experience 
for example my conception of a particular flower 
is obscure when i have not noticed it so closely as 
to be able to distinguish it as a whole from certain 
others it is indistinct when i know it as a whole 
but have not analysed it so minutely as to be 
able to enumerate its botanical characteristics in 
these cases the defect is empirical and can only 
be remedied by closer attention to the individual 
flowers of that kind but on the other hand my 
conception may be obscure as containing attributes 
inconsistent with the existence of its object as an 
individual whole or it may be indistinct as con 
taining attributes incapable of coexisting with each 
other as parts of a whole thus we may be told 
to conceive a flower of no colour at all or a flower 
which shall be both red and white on the same 
part of the same leaf in these cases the defect is 
in the thought itself and accordingly logic is 
competent to declare the supposed object incon 
ceivable again a judgment may be empirically 
false as asserting a combination of attributes never 
actually found in experience as if it is asserted that 
a horse has five legs it may be logically false as 



 prolegomena logca 

coupling together attributes which contradict each 
other as if it is asserted that a quadruped has five 
legs in the former case i can contradict the 
assertion only by an appeal to the experience of 
all who are acquainted with the animal in the 
latter i can contradict it on logical grounds as 
false in the thought itself an inference in like 
manner may be empirically inconsequent as 
grounded on a relation of phenomena not in 
variable in nature it may be logically incon 
sequent as deduced from premises not neces 
sitating it by the laws of thought thus if i am 
asked whether this particular fall of the barometer 
is a ground for asserting that it will rain within 
twelve hours i can only reply as a logician that 
it is so if all falls of the barometer are so but 
whether this is the case in fact cannot be decided 
by logic but by experience on the other hand 
if it be expressly stated that some falls only of the 
barometer are indications of rain within twelve 
hours i can at once decide that it is logically

it thus appears that in all the three operations

incompetent to detect their external vices as

it cannot decide as to the necessary sequence of a

not in strict accuracy be used as synonymous 
the former is used properly with reference to an 
operation the latter with reference to its product 
conceiving judging reasoning are subject to 
certain laws concepts judgments syllogisms 
exhibit certain forms but the laws of thought 
are not always competent to determine its form 
as has been already shewn in the case of all the 
products of mixed thinking in a synthetical 
judgment for example the laws of thought can 
determine only its possible truth which equally 
implies its possible falsehood thus leaving it 
altogether undecided whether the form of the 

s 



 prolegomena logica 

judgment should be affirmative or negative uni 
versal or particular the form in all these cases 
is determined by that universal tendency of the 
human mind which has been noticed in a former 
chapter the tendency to regard physical phe 
nomena as indicating the existence of a substance 
or a cause similar to that of which we are directly 
conscious in our own mental states and operations 
tt is thus that when experience presents certain 
phenomena in juxtaposition the mind is invariably 
led to regard them as attributes of one and the 
same substance and this constitutes the form of 
all mixed concepts and judgments and in like 
manner when one phenomenon is the invariable 
consequent of another the mind is irresistibly led 
to regard them as respectively cause and effect 
and this constitutes the form in all cases of mixed 
inference the same tendencies which thus co 
operate with the presentations of experience in 
the acts of mixed thinking cooperate in like 
manner with the laws of thought in acts of pure 
thinking in the former case the attributes are 
given as empirically related as intuitions in the 
latter they are given as logically related as 
thoughts and in both they are regarded as 
mutually related to some unknown substance or 
cause but that these tendencies however uni 
versal or irresistible cannot properly be regarded 
as laws of thought or of intuition is manifest from 
the fact that they furnish no criterion for de 



prolegomena logica 

termining the legitimacy or illegitimacy of any 
product thoughts whether empirically true or 
false whether logically sound or unsound in this 
respect present precisely the same features an 
assertion false in point of fact or selfcontradictory 
in point of thought contains as regards the sup 
posed relation of attributes to a common substance 
precisely the same form as one logically and em 
pirically valid the principle of substance and 
causality are thus rather negative conditions than 
positive laws of thought they have a psycho 
logical relation to thought as it actually exists 
explaining and accounting for the fact of its 
invariably assuming a certain form but they have 
no logical relation to thought as it ought to be 
and furnish no criterion of its validity in any 
special instance 

logical or pure thinking is not therefore called 
formal because its product exhibits a form for 
the coexistence of matter and form is common 
to all thought and to all spurious imitations of 
thought but the justification of the terms formal 
and material as applied to pure and mixed pro 
cesses of thinking is to be found in the circum 
stance that in the former the act of thought is 
based on the form only of the preliminary data 
without reference to the particular matter while 
on the other hand matter is necessarily taken into 
account in every process of mixed thinking to 
an act of logical conception for example it is 



 prolegomena looica 

not necessary to examine in any case the special 
character of the attributes as having been actually 
combined in experience but only that they should 
be compatible with the possible existence of an 
object in space or time in an act of logical 
judgment one of the given concepts being always 
comprehended in the other it is indifferent of 
what special attributes either is composed pro 
vided they possess sufficient clearness and dis 
tinctness to enable the mind to discern the relation 
between them in an act of logical reasoning 
the validity of the conclusion depends solely on 
the quantity and quality of the given premises 
without any reference to the particular terms of 
which they are composed in all so long as the 
formal relation of the data remains the same the 
matter may be changed as we please without 
affecting the logical value of the thought in 
mixed thinking on the other hand the matter is 
of principal importance to determine that this 
or that object of conception actually exists that 
this or that judgment is in accordance with expe 
rience that this or that inference is sufficiently 
probable to furnish a reasonable motive to action 
we require to be guided by a knowledge of the 
nature and circumstances of the particular object 
in question and it is for this reason that all ex 
amples of logical thinking are better expressed by 
means of arbitrary symbols than of significant 
terms not that it is in any case possible to think 



prolegomena logca 

without some matter or other but because it is 
wholly indifferent what matter we may at the time 
be thinking about and therefore by employing 
an unmeaning sign indifferently representative of 
any object of thought we are enabled to clear the 
process from any accidental admixture of material 
knowledge and to exhibit the form alone iikits 
proper relation to the laws of thought 

in accordance with the view here given of form 
and formal processes it will be proper to modify 
slightly some of the definitions of logic given by 
those philosophers whose views have been princi 
pally followed in the present work logic to omit 
less accurate views of its nature has been defined 
as the science of the bare form of thought k or 
as the science of the formal laws of thought — 
definitions which though substantially approaching 
far nearer to the truth than any antagonist view 
still leave something to desire in point of verbal 
accuracy the term formal strictly belongs rather 
to the process of pure thinking than to the laws by 
which it is regulated or to the science which takes 
cognisance of them and logic is not the science 
of the forms of thought in general but only of 
such as are subservient to other processes of formal 
thinking other forms such as modality fall 
without the province of logic and within that of 
psychology to which latter science indeed all the

forms and laws of thought belong in their relation 
to the constitution of the thinking subject to 
logic on the other hand belong the same forms 
and laws in relation to those acts and products 
of pure thinking which are suggested by the one 
and governed by the other if therefore slightly 
altering the language of the above definitions we 
define logic as the science of the laws and pro 
ducts of pure or formal thinking we shall 
express with tolerable accuracy its character and 
province according to the views advocated in the 
preceding pages 

¦ this coincides nearly with the definition given by sir w 
hamilton reids works p the science of the lam of thought

chapter viii 

on positive and negative thought 

logic has been described by kant as the science 
of the necessary laws of the understanding and of 
the reason psychologically the propriety of this 
division of the mental faculties has been called in 
question by eminent critics and in a logical 
point of view it is untenable if as i have endea 
voured to shewjudgment and reasoning in so far 
as they are logical processes are both governed by 
the same laws and must be referred to the same 
faculty in the present chapter however it is 
proposed to examine another expression of the 
same definition and to enquire in what sense the 
laws of thought can properly be called necessary 
kant employed this term to distinguish the laws 
of thought in general from those of thought as 
employed upon any definite class of objects it 
being optional with every man and therefore con 
tingent whether he shall exercise his understand

ing on one class of objects rather than another b 
this distinction i have preferred to express in 
other words by separating pure ot formal from 
mixed or material thinking but the kantian 
phraseology may serve to introduce a subject the 
right understanding of which is of considerable 
importance in logic the difference namely be 
tween positive and negative thinking the phrase 
necessary laws of thought if such language is allow 
able ought to imply that we cannot think at all 
except under their conditions and yet it is notorious 
that such laws are daily transgressed that nothing 
is more common than illogical reasoning to 
reconcile the language with the fact is the object 
of the following observations 

illogical reasoning may be of two very different 
kinds it may violate the laws ofthought in cases 
where they are applicable or it may endeavour to 
extend them to cases where they are not applicable 
the offence in the former case consists in attempt 
ing to draw a conclusion opposed to that which 
the laws require in the latter in attempting to 
draw a conclusion where none can be legitimately 
inferred thus we may verbally at least reason 
 all a is b all c is a therefore no c is b w or 
we may reason all a is b some c is not a 
therefore some c is not b if the laws of thought 
are in the strict sense necessary i e obligatory 
upon every act of thinking it will follow that these 

b kant tjoffik einleitung j 



prolegomena logic a 

supposed reasonings are neither of them acts of 
thought at all 

it is of course always possible to compose a 
verbal representation of a thought in which the 
rules of logic shall be violated and to understand 
fully the meaning of each word of which it is 
composed the test however of the reality of a 
thought does not lie in the possibility of assertion 
but in the possibility of conception in the power 
that is to say of combining the given attributes in 
a single image representative of an individual object 
of intuition d i may make use of the words a 
round square or a bilinear figure but the terms 
imply no conception because the attributes cannot 
be united in an image these words therefore are 
not the signs of thought but only express the 
negation of any object on which thought can be 
exercised 

and such in ultimate analysis will be seen to 
be the case with all verbal combinations in which 
the laws of formal thinking are violated whether 
directly by denying their authority in cases to

observed before that all conception implies imagination 
though all imagination does not imply conception see above

 prolegomena logica 

which they are applicable or indirectly by attempt 
ing to apply them to cases where they are not 
applicable the only difference between these two 
offences is that in the former case the product is 
no thought whatever in the latter it is not that 
kind of thought which it professes to be 

let us suppose for example a syllogistic con 
clusion verbally asserted the reverse of that which 
the laws of thought require such as u all a is b 
all c is a therefore some c is not b w this rear 
soiling supposes the possibility of conceiving a c 
which shall at the same time be b and not b 
tried by this test the form of words is ascertained 
to be representative of no thought at all 

on the other hand in a case where the law of 
reasoning is not applicable as in the apparent 
syllogism t€ all y is some z no x is any y 
therefore no x is any z the thought is anni 
hilated as a syllogism only as a mere judgment 
the concluding proposition may or may not be true 
and there is no impossibility in conceiving an x 
which is neither y nor z but as a syllogism it 
maintains that x is not z became it is not y in 
other words that nothing which is not y can be z 
or that all z is y — an assertion which again in 
volves a contradiction of the major premise which 
in asserting that all y is some z only implies at 
the same time that some z is not y this contra 
diction is not so apparent in the ordinary form of 
the affirmative proposition in which the predicate 



prolegomena looica 

is expressed as indefinite though thought as parti 
cular and thus theelliptical and imperfect language 
of common logic has caused to be overlooked the 
important truth that illogical thinking is in reality 
no thinking at all 

the language of this chapter may recall to the 
mind of the reader a distinction made in an earlier 
portion of the present work between positive and 
negative ideas a comparison of the two cases will 
serve to shew that the expression negative thinking 
or negation of thought is properly applicable to 
both though in different relations and on different 
grounds positive thinking implies two conditions 
firstly the material condition that certain attri 
butes be given as united in a concept secondly 
the formal condition that the concept be capable 
of individualization i e that the attributes be such 
as can coexist in an object perceived or imagined 
if either of these conditions be wanting we are 
deficient in the sine qua non of actual thought 
a given form of words may thus in two different 
ways be void of a thought corresponding we 
may be unable to conceive separately one or more 
of the attributes given or we may be unable to 
conceive them in combination the former is the 
case when we have never been personally conscious 
of the said attribute as presented the latter is the 
case when the several presentations are incom 
patible with each other 

from defect in the first of these conditions 



 prolegomena logica 

a man born blind may be said to have a negative 
idea of light which he knows only as something 
different from darkness and consequently of the 
various colours which are different modifications 
of light and any man in like manner has but a 
negative idea of a colour which he has not actually 
seen f the blind man may be able to distinguish 
a sphere from a cube by touch but if he is told 
that the ball which he has in his hand is white he 
cannot connect the word with any sensation of which 
he has been at any time conscious and in like 
manner a man who has seen white objects only 
has no idea of red he knows it only as some 
colour which he has not seen in this manner 
it is that we have negative ideas only of many of 
the objects on which men most boldly speculate 
such is the case with all our speculations on 
causality as existing apart from the conscious 
exertion of power on substance other than as 
a conscious self on consciousness in general apart 
from the conditions of space and time of these 

 in the first of these instances the negative idea is so 
obscure as to be tantamount in its actual result to no idea 
at nil still the corresponding state of mind is not one of 
pure quiescence or mere absence of thought a blind man 
who had lived all his life among a nation of blind men and 
who had thus never been led to infer the existence visible 
objects at all would be in a different state from one who 
is continually told of things which he is unable to see and 
whose mind is consequently roused to an effort though an 
ineffectual one 



prolegomena logica 

we can only speak as a causality which is not our 
causality as a substance different from our 
substance as a consciousness unlike our con 
sciousness the same is the case with all the 
speculations of our reason concerning infinity 
and infinite attributes as such by removing 
the condition of limitation we remove the only 
condition under which such attributes have ever 
been presented to our consciousness further 
speculation is not thought but its negation 

the second condition fails in cases of illogical 
thinking all of which may be shewn ultimately to 
annihilate themselves by involving a contradiction 
and in these cases the attempt to individualize 
the thought furnishes at once a decisive criterion 
of its negative character in the former instances 
the thought is only ultimately discovered to be 
unattainable from the failure of every attempt to 
realize it in the present case the attributes can 
be immediately determined to be unthinkable as 
mutually destroying one another the former 
may be distinguished as materially or relatively 
negative from the absence of the requisite data 
for thinking the latter are formally or absolutely 
negative as containing data which offend against 
the universal laws of human thought the former 
might become positive if man were furnished with 
a new sense or any additional faculty of intuition 
the latter could only become so by a complete

inversion of the existing constitution of his mind 
the negative character of the first is shewn by 
psychology which ascertains empirically the limit 
ations to which the mind is subject in the accu 
mulation of materials for thinking the negative 
character of the second is shewn by logic which 
lays down d priori the conditions to which all 
materials whencesoever derived must be subjected 
in the formation of thought 

it is of the utmost importance to distinguish 
these two kinds of negative thinking the material 
or psychological and the formal or logical from 
each other no error in philosophy is more 
frequent in its occurrence or more pernicious in 
its results than a confusion on this point men 
are apt to mistake the absence of the materials for 
one thought for the presence of materials for its 
opposite — to imagine that it is all one to be unable 
to think of an object as existing and to be able 
to think of it as not existing — to fancy that 
certain positions are condemned by the laws of 
the understanding when the fact is only that their 
materials have not been given in an intuition — 
to suppose that to be rejected by reason which 
in truth has never come in contact with reason 
at all 

to examine in detail the prominent instances of 
the above confusion which are plentifully exhibited 
by some of the socalled philosophers of the present 
time would require a work of a higher and more

controversial character than the present i shall 
content myself with selecting two examples one 
ancient and one modern as specimens of the 
confident manner in which men of all ages and 
under all religious systems have been prone to 
dogmatize upon the highest matters of speculation 
upon no better basis than the absence of all 
materials for speculating at all 

aristotles wellknown argument to prove that 
the happiness of the gods consists in contem 
plation is based on the ground that we cannot 
attribute to them moral attributes in the only way 
in which such attributes come within the sphere 
of human consciousness viz under the limitations 
and imperfections consequent upon human passion 
and human error what scope he asks can there 
be for fortitude where there is no pain to undergo 
or for temperance where there are no evil desires 
to keep in check h but the reasoning is incom 
plete cotta in cicero pursuing the same prin 
ciple to its ultimate consequences shews clearly 
that we must equally deny of the deity the 
possession of any intellectual as well as of any 
moral quality what is the object of reason 
and intelligence but to gain a knowledge of 
that which is obscure what is the purpose of 
contemplation but to gain a closer insight into 
the nature of the things contemplated intel 
lectual attainments have the same relation to 

h eth nic x 



 prolegomena logic a 

human ignorance that moral virtues have to 
human frailty 

the error of both these reasonings is the same 
it consists in mistaking a psychological deficiency 
for a logical impossibility to determine in thought 
that certain attributes cannot exist in any being 
except under given conditions of manifestation it 
would be necessary that we should have had per 
sonal experience of the abrogation of those con 
ditions and of the absolute destruction of the 
attributes in consequence but such an experience 
in the present case is ex hypothesis impossible the 
conditions being those to which the universal 
human consciousness is subject to pronounce 
how consciousness exists in beings of a different 
nature from ourselves it would be necessary that 
we should be capable of possessing their nature 
and faculties as well as our own and of comparing 
the two together by the aid of a third power in 
dependent of either to pronounce that certain 
modes of consciousness cannot exist save as they 
exist to us it is necessary that we should have 
personally tried every other possible relation of 
modes of consciousness to a conscious subject 
until human experience has extended thus far to 
limit the province of faith by that of reason — to 
say that what we cannot compass in thought we may 
not believe as existing is to pass from criticism 
to dogmatism a dogmatism resting its claims to

the modern atheism of the german philo 
sopher feuerbach is based on a similar confusion 
it assumes that the measure of what man is 
to believe is to be determined by what he can 
grasp in an act of positive thought in other 
words that the mere absence of the necessary 
data for thinking at all is tantamount to a logical 
determination of the nonexistence of a corre 
sponding object god according to this system 
is but humanity deified in its intellectual or 
moral or physical attributes according to the 
varying condition characters and wants of this or 
that people but in all according to one form or 
another of anthropomorphism 

falsehood is only dangerous from its possessing 
a certain portion of a mutilated truth the one 
element of truth which underlies the atheism of 
the essence of religion is the fact that finite 
thought can only be positively exercised on finite 
objects thought on its positive side is ulti 
mately tested by the individualization of concepts 
to effect this they must be referred to the 
representative image of some actual state of 
consciousness — sensation volition affection c

in attempting to grasp the deity as an object of 
positive thought — to speculate beyond what is 
revealed to us of the divine attributes as mani 
fested in relation and accommodation to human 
faculties man can only bring god down to his 
own level and exercise his reason on those 
analogous attributes of which he has had expe 
rience in his personal consciousness the error 
consists in overlooking the religious feelings and 
affections as a distinct class of psychological 
facts coordinate with not subordinate to the

general as well as the consciousness of each 
individual alike testify that religion is not a 
function of thought and that the attempt to 
make it so if consistently carried out necessarily 
leads firstly to anthropomorphism and ultimately 
to atheism 

the incompetency of such reasoning to prove 
its conclusion is manifest from the fact that the 
mental phenomena on which alone it rests 
must from the nature of the case be precisely 
the same whether that conclusion be true or false 
if human thought is subject to laws and limit 
ations formal and material the mode and the 
sphere of positive thinking must be such as those 
laws and limitations require whether there exist

chapter ix 

of logic as belated to otheb mental sciences 

a division was early established in philosophy 
between the logica docens and the logica uteris 
the one concerned with the pure laws and forms 
of thought the other with the application of 
thought to this or that object matter the 
relations of the latter it is not my present purpose 
to examine every art or science in so far as it 
contains reasonings on its own special objects 
may be regarded as furnishing an instance of the 
logica utens and in this point of view logic has 
no special affinity with one branch of knowledge 
rather than another but in relation to the logica 
docens there are three branches of science real or 
apparent which from community of object and 
method as well as from historical connection 
demand a more special consideration 

the three sciences in question are grammar 
psychology and metaphysics rhetoric from 
an association with logic and grammar in the 
mediaeval trivium might also be thought to have 
a special claim on our attention but in truth 
rhetoric is connected by community of object 



prolegomena logica 

matter rather with the art of dialectic as exhi 
bited in the topics of aristotle and the probable 
syllogisms of the scholastic logic than with the 
formal science as treated of in the present work 
its relation to the latter is only by way of appli 
cation inasmuch as logical forms may be applied 
in rhetorical exercises — a relation which reduces 
it to a level with any other employment of the 
logica uteris with psychology indeed its con 
nection is far more intimate but on the opposite 
side from that by which the same science is 
related to logic logic as the science of the 
laws and products of the understanding is related 
to psychology through the medium of the spe 
culative and discursive faculties rhetoric as 
concerned with the movement of the will is 
related on the side of the emotional and prac 
tical faculties and is thus correctly described by 
aristotle as an offshoot of dialectic and moral 
philosophy 

on the other hand psychology metaphysics 
and grammar are intimately connected with the 
faculties the laws and the instruments of the 
universal process of thought — a connection which 
has been recognised with more or less clearness 
from the origin of logic to the present time 
the categories from the days of aristotle down 
wards have been disputed ground between logic 
and metaphysics and are treated of by the 
stagirite himself in connection with both sciences

the treatise irepl epfirjvtla whose title sorely

less prominently introduced claims her share in 
the multifarious matter of the organon in the 
account of the processes of sensation memory 
and experience as subsidiary to induction 

were we indeed to start from the whole organon 
of aristotle as an uniform treatise on a single 
subject it would be difficult to accommodate its 
contents to any modern classification of the mental 
sciences but it may fairly be questioned whether 
even the authority of the philosopher himself can 
be adduced in support of such a proceeding while 
we cannot help admitting with sir william hamil

vailed and still prevail in regard to the nature and 
province of logic are mainly to be attributed to 
the authority of the father of the science it may 
be doubted how far that authority has been put 
to a legitimate use by his followers the same

eminent critic to whom we have just referred has 
observed in another place that there is required 
for the metaphysician not less imagination than 
for the poet that it may in fact be doubted 
whether homer or aristotle possessed this faculty 
in greater vigour the two authors here placed 
in juxtaposition may be compared in more respects 
than that of their mental powers the influence 
of homer in poetry has been similar to that of 
aristotle in philosophy yet while from the 
father of criticism to the present day there has 
never been wanting a champion to maintain against 
all impugners the unity of design of the iliad 
and its exact relation to a beginning a middle and 
an end the primary argument of this one entire 
and perfect chrysolite has been almost as much 
disputed among critics as the question of the 
definition of logic different portions of the poem 
have been pronounced genuine or spurious accord 
ing to this or that conception of the poets design 
and finally it has even been maintained that the 
model of all succeeding epics is little more than a 
fortuitous concourse of atoms the fragments of 
distinct rhapsodists the organon of aristotle 
has had a similar fate various have been the 
conjectures concerning its design and method 
portions have been at different times regarded as 
logical as grammatical as metaphysical nor have 
there been wanting critics to deny the genuineness

of this or that part the parallel might be carried 
further the different portions of the iliad are 
said to have been collected and arranged in the 
time of pisistratus about years after the date 
assigned by herodotus rightly or wrongly to 
the birth of the poet and the writings of aristotle 
are generally supposed to have received their present 
form and arrangement at the hands of andronicus 
of rhodes a philosopher who flourished about 
three centuries later than the stagirite i am not 
indeed aware that any critic has been bold enough 
to maintain a thoroughly wolfian hypothesis of 
the origin of the organon and yet there are not 
wanting grounds on which a not very different 
theory might be supported not indeed as regards 
the authorship but certainly as regards the unity 
of design of the work the title by which the 
collected treatises are known is undoubtedly of 
recent origin it is not found in aristotle himself 
nor in any of his earlier commentators and as far 
as existing evidence can determine it appears not 
to have been in common use before the fifteenth 
century d the several treatises themselves are 
invariably mentioned by their author as distinct 
works under distinct titles and even after the time of 
andronicus commentaries were generally written 
not on the organon as a whole but separately on 
its constituent parts if from the books we turn to 
the matters of which they treat the result is the

same logic as the name of an art or science 
does not once occur in the writings of aristotle

peculiar and much more restricted sense than that

as analytic and dialectic are commensurate with

philosophy into logic physics and ethics adopted

field of inquiry i shall proceed to examine the 
relation in which logic as thus exhibited stands 
towards the cognate sciences of psychology 
grammar and metaphysics 

of psychology something has already been said 
in the earlier portion of the present essay logic 
deals with the products of the several thinking 
acts with concepts with judgments with reason 
ings as according to certain assumed laws of 
thinking they ought to be or not to be f it is 
competent to test the validity of all such products 
in so far as they comply or not with the conditions 
of pure thought leaving to this or that branch of 
material science to determine how far the same 
products of thought are guaranteed by the testi 
mony of this or that special experience thus it 
accepts as logically valid all such concepts judg 
ments and reasonings as do not directly or in 
directly imply contradictions pronouncing them 
thus far to be legitimate as thoughts that they do 
not in ultimate analysis destroy themselves that 
rhey will be also accepted upon an appeal to expe 
rience it does not decide it only recommends 
them as qualified for further examination it is

thus competent to determine the possible existence 
of a class of objects corresponding to a given 
concept the necessary truth of an analytical and 
the possible truth of a synthetical judgment the 
formal validity of a conclusion as necessarily fol 
lowing from certain assumed premises questions 
concerning the real existence of this or that class 
of objects the actual truth of a synthetical judg 
ment or of a conclusion out of relation to its given 
premises it sends up for judgment to the tribunal 
of experience 

as experience decides on the relations of any 
given product of thought to the actual phenomena 
presented by this or that object of intuition so 
psychology decides on its relations to the actual 
constitution of the human mind why it is that 
the laws of pure thinking extend thus far and no 
further — what are the mental processes preliminary 
and subsidiary to thought and the nature of the 
thinking act itself as giving rise to the logical 
products — whence arises the phenomenon of ille 
gitimate thinking — the nature and origin of various 
impediments and errors to which thinking and 
other mental acts are subjected in mankind — the 
relation of the several mental acts to one or more 
faculties of mind and the value of such distinction 
as absolute or relative implying a notional only 
or an actual separability — in short all inquiries 
into the actual phenomena of mans mental con

stitution and their explanation form the object 
matter of psychology g 

from this it appears that psychology as well 
as physical science is in the widest sense of the 
term empirical it inquires that is to say what 
are the actual phenomena of the several acts and 
states of the human mind and the actual laws or 
conditions on which they depend and in this 
sense the laws of thought themselves are empirical 
and within the province of psychology inasmuch 
a° it is a matter of fact and experience that men 
lo reason according to them logic on the other 
hand can in no sense be called empirical inasmuch 
as the actual constitution whether of the world 
within or of the world without is assumed indeed 
and implied in its researches but in no respect 
described or investigated we are not to ascertain 
as a matter of fact that men do reason in this or 
that form as governed by this or that law but on 
the assumption of certain laws we are to determine 
a priori the forms which legitimate thinking ought 
to exhibit whether mankind in general do comply 
with them or not logic is indeed ultimately to 
be referred to the test of experience but only in 

 much of this is distinguished by kant as applied logic 
which however he allows to be more properly referred to 
psychology

respect of its conformity with facts without its 
province not in respect of the coherence of its 
parts within so far as it implies that as a matter 
of fact men do reason in syllogisms so far its 
pretensions may be tested by reference to the 
empirical truths of psychology so far as it asserts 
that the legitimate forms of the syllogism are such 
and such it is simply deductive a priori and 
necessarily valid for any class of thinking beings 
whose laws are such as it presupposes an empi 
rical science may contain much partial truth though 
omitting many important phenomena and erro 
neously accounting for many which it recognises 
it offers much therefore for enlarged experience 
gradually to supply and correct an a priori 
science like logic is tested by experience only 
with reference to its fundamental hypotheses if 
these are accepted they carry with them the whole 
superstructure of details if these are rejected 
every portion of the science falls to the ground 
along with them 

but though logic and psychology have thus 
each their respective provinces and methods it 
cannot be too often repeated that neither can be 
taught as a science efficiently and satisfactorily 
unless in connection with the other we may 
learn by rote a multitude of logical rules and 
fondly imagine that we are acquiring an art 
which will enable us to think — a course of logic 
being in fact about as necessary for making men 



 prolegomena logic a 

thinkers as a course of ethical philosophy for 
making them honest or a course of optics for 
enabling them to see or we may analyse in 
dictione and extra dictionem all sorts of imaginary 
fallacies propounded by imaginary sophists and 
dream that we are forging an impenetrable pano 
ply against all the deceits of the world— as if we 
could bind men down in heavy securities to lie 
and cheat by rulein order that they may be 
detected in due course of art or we may draw 
up syllogisms in orthodox mood and figure and 
babble about laws of thought and never dream 
of asking what is the nature of thought as a 
process and with what elements does it combine 
in the actual formation of this or that compound 
or on the other hand starting from confused or 
erroneous notions of the nature and powers of the 
human mind we may blame logic for not accom 
plishing what no science can accomplish and 
deem its whole contents a tissue of jargon and 
imposture because it is neither able to open a 
royal road to the encyclopaedia nor to convert 
natural folly into supernatural wisdom it may 
safely be asserted that nine tenths of the mistaken 
judgments to which logic has been subjected on 
the part of friends and adversaries unreasonable 
eulogy on the one hand equally unreasonable 
abuse or contempt on the other have been owing 
to its treatment out of relation to psychology — to 
its having been expounded and studied without

any preliminary attempt to ascertain what are the 
nature and limits of the thinking faculty and what 
character its laws and products ought to exhibit

mind 

with grammar logic is connected through the 
medium of the universal instrument of thought 
language the practical necessity of this instru 
ment for the formation as well as for the com 
munication of thought has been noticed already 
it remains to inquire in what different ways this 
their common object is dealt with by logic and 
grammar respectively universal grammar with 
which alone we are concerned the history and 
idiomatic peculiarities of special languages being 
obviously unconnected with general logic has 
been happily defined as the science of the rela 
tions which the constituent parts of speech bear 
to each other in significant combination v it is 
thus concerned with language primarily and essen 
tially logic secondarily and accidentally the 
former has given certain articulate sounds to find 
their relation to certain supposed counterparts in 
thought the latter has given to determine the 
necessary relations of concepts to each other but 
in so doing it is compelled secondarily to exhibit

grammaire p 

u 



 prolegomena logica 

the corresponding relations of the sounds by which 
concepts are represented 

the two sciences differ also in the extent of 
their provinces logic considers language simply 
as the instrument and representative of thought 
grammar will include its relation to intuitions and 
emotions and every state of consciousness which 
finds its expression in speech k logic considers 
language only in so far as it is indispensable to 
thought and accordingly analyses speech only to 
that point at which it is representative of the 
simplest element of thought the concept any 
parts into which a concept may be divided which 
are not themselves concepts are beyond its pro 
vince as not being representative of a complete 
thought nor competent instruments alone for the 
performance of an act of thinking hence all 
syncategorematic words as not being per se signi 
ficant are not recognised by logic 

in grammar the unit of thought is a judgment 
both terms being necessarily represented by words 
hence the unit of speech in grammar is a pro 
position the office of the subordinate parts of 
speech being to limit or connect the primary parts 
as subjects or predicates of a given assertion 



k see harris hermes ch iii 

 for a further illustration of this doctrine not universally 
held by grammarians the reader is referred to an article by 
the present author on the philosophy of language in the 
north british review no

such connections and limitations may be more 
conveniently effected by the invention of words 
expressive of relations between concepts than 
by the use of distinct signs for every new con 
cept resulting from such relations this however 
is one of the luxuries only not one of the 
necessaries of language and as such is not 
noticed by logic viewed simply as an element 
of thought it is indifferent whether the same 
concept be expressed by a combination of sub 
stantive and adjective as in the english four 
footed beast or the german vierfiissiges thier 
by the interposition of a preposition as in the 
french bte a quatre pieds or by a single 
substantive such as the classical equivalent 
 quadruped 

in logic the unit of thought is also a judg 
ment but not one which requires a verbal repre 
sentative of both its constituent parts conception 
the simplest act of thought consists in the referring 
a given concept to possible objects as imagined 
here there is in the psychological sense of the 
term a judgment i e a consciousness of the pre 
sence of the objects in thought but that con 
sciousness does not form an additional concept 
nor require as its necessary exponent a second 
verbal sign hence the unit of speech in logic 
is a term such being a sufficient verbal instrument 
for the performance of the first and simplest act of 
thought 

u 



 prolegomena logica 

with reference to the second operation of 
thought judgment wherein the two sciences 
come most nearly into contact the following 
distinction is important grammar considers 
words objectively as signs of things hence the 
distinction of tenses according as the remote or 
represented object is considered as contempora 
neous with or distant in time from the speaker 
logic considers words subjectively as signs of 
thoughts hence the only logical tense is the 
present the immediate or presented objects being 
necessarily contemporaneous with the act of con 
sciousness by which they are now thought in 
conjunction 

it is sometimes said that logic recognises two 
only of the grammatical parts of speech the noun 
and the verb forming the two terms of the pro 
position with and without time it would be

interpretations of aristotle the type of the logical proposition 
is the form distinguished as secundi adjacmti the verb being 
neither the copula alone nor the predicate alone but the 



prolegomena logic a 

more correct to say that logic viewing language 
in a different light from grammar and analysing 
on a different principle does not recognise the 
grammatical parts of speech at all the simplest 
elements of a complete assertion in grammar are 
the noun and the verb the latter being a com 
bination of attribute and assertion hence the 
grammatical type of a proposition is that distin 
guished in scholastic language as secundi adfacentisf 
and to this form all varieties produced by the 
accidents of particular languages must in universal 
grammar be virtually reduced p in logic on 
the other hand for the purposes of opposition 
and conversion as well as from the necessity of 
assigning a quantity to both terms of the pro 
position the type is required to be of the form 



combination of the two however expressed a neglect of 
this has misled many commentators and critics on aristotle 
from ammonius to the present day 

 in all languages there are only two sorts of words 
which are necessary for the communication of our thoughts 
the noun and the verb tooke div of parley ch 

p hence it follows that the copula is grammatically speak 
ing no verb at all it fulfils none of the functions of that 
part of speech for it implies no attribute and cannot when 
united to a subject form a complete assertion in such a 
sentence as m the meadows are white with frost the true 
verb is not the copula but the copula with the adjective are 
white as may be seen by substituting the latin prata can is 
albicant pruinis whether this can be expressed in one word 
or not is an accidenfcof this or that language and is beyond 
the province of universal grammar 



 prolegomena logic a 

tertii adjacentis the subject and predicate being 
regarded as two given concepts the objects of 
which are identified or distinguished by means of 
the copula hence in every case in which the 
proposition is exhibited in its logical form the 
grammatical verb will correspond not to any 
single word in the proposition but to a com 
bination formed of the copula and the quantified 
predicate — to all in short that is asserted of the 
subject the predicate concept may thus in 
different points of view answer to two distinct 
grammatical relations taken by itself it is a 
noun identified in certain respects with another 
noun as the subject taken in its predicate 
character it forms a portion of the verb the 
remainder being supplied by the copula those 
logicians who maintain the copula to be the 
logical verb confound the accidents of particular 
languages with the essentials of language in general 
as a sign of thought with them the verb is 
determined solely by the subordinate feature of 
its personal inflection not by the primary charac 
teristic of its signification 

with regard to the relation of logic to meta 
physics some preliminary verbal explanation is 
necessary owing to the various senses in which 
the latter term has been used among modern 
philosophers empirical psychology which the 
ancients regarded as a branch of physics is

frequently classified as metaphysical thus the 
contributions of reid and stewart to the inductive 
science of the human mind are not unfrequently 
spoken of as scotch metaphysics a nomenclature 
which the latter of these philosophers has in some 
degree sanctioned by his own writings such a 
classification is however inconsistent with the 
fundamental doctrines of the scottish school 
it has been before observed that one of their 
leading principles is that in the investigation of 
mind as well as of matter phenomena alone are 
the legitimate objects of science the substance and 
essential nature of both being beyond the reach 
of human faculties whereas metaphysics has 
from the earliest days been distinguished as the 
science of being as being in opposition to all 
inquiries into the phenomena exhibited by this or 
that class of objects how far such a problem 
is capable of solution is another question but the 
mere propounding of it implies an object totally 

r for instance nothing contributes so much to form 
this talent as the study of metaphysics not the absurd 
metaphysics of the schools but that study which has the 
operations of the mind for its object elements vol i ch 
in other places stewart has noticed this phraseology as a 
loose use of language and has attempted to account for it 
but the term ought never to have been used at all

distinguished in all ages as the one and the real 
in opposition to the many and the apparent

qualities discernible some by sight some by smell 
some by touch some by hearing what is the

them what is it by virtue of which these several

religion these three objects of metaphysical 
inquiry god the world the mind correspond 
to kants three ideas of the pure reason and 
the object of his critique is to shew that in 
relation to all three the attainment of a system 
of speculative philosophy is impossible 

the former of these methods is the bolder and 
the more consequent and moreover the only 
one which can be consistently followed by those 
who believe in the possibility of a philosophy 
of the absolute for a plurality of real objects 
being once admitted as the highest reach attain 
able by human faculties these must necessarily be 
regarded as related to and limited by each other 
accordingly this method has been followed by 
the hardiest and most consistent reasoners on 
metaphysical questions by spinoza under the 
older form of speculation and by hegel after the 
kantian revolution but thus treated metaphysical 
speculation necessarily leads to pantheism and 
pantheism at this elevation is for all religious 
purposes equivalent to atheism the method is 

y it has of late been a favourite criticism of spinoza to say 
with hegel that his system is not atheism but acosmism 
and this is true in a speculative point of view but if i allow 
of no god distinct from the aggregate of the universe myself 
included what object have i of worship or if according to 
the later manifestation of pantheism the divine mind is but 
the sum total of every finite consciousness my own included 
what religious relation between god and man is compatible

thus condemned by its results and the condemn

commences by denying this relation starts with an 
assumption concerning the possible character of 
an intelligence other than human and conse 
quently incapable of verification by any human 
being yet the system is the product of a human 
thinker and addressed to human disciples 

the second method of metaphysical inquiry is 
less presumptuous though perhaps also less con

of beings thus virtually abandoning the philo 
sophy of the absolute this plurality is primarily

notself as related to and limiting each other 
but the consciousness of the relative and limited 
suggests by contrast the idea of the absolute and 
unlimited and thus gives rise to three distinct 
branches of metaphysical speculation the ego 
being identified with the substance of the human 
soul as distinguished from its phenomenal modes 
the nonego being identified with the reality which 
underlies the phenomena of the sensible world 
and the absolute or unconditioned with the deity

known as rational theology which endeavours 
from the conception of god as an absolutely 
perfect being to deduce the necessary attributes of 
the divine nature i shall say nothing in this place 
the question of the relation of the human mind to 
religious intuitions is one of the most delicate and 
the most difficult in psychology and to treat it 
adequately would require a separate volume on 
the two latter branches of metaphysics which 
kant regarded as equally unattainable with the 
first something has been said in a former chapter 
it was the opinion of kant as well as of reid and 
stewart that the subject of mental as well as of 
bodily attributes is not an immediate object of 
consciousness — in other words that in mind as

well as in body substance and unity are not 
presented but represented those who accept this 
doctrine are only consistent in regarding meta 
physical inquiry in all its branches as a delusion 
but a philosophical examination is incomplete 
unless it not only points out the truth but like 
wise explains the cause of error the weak point 
of the above doctrine is that it fails in explaining 
on psychological grounds how the supposed 
delusion originated experience furnishes if not 
the cause at least the occasion of every object of 
our cognition and unless upon the supposition 
that a knowledge of unity and substance is 
immediately given in one phase at least of con 
sciousness it is impossible to account for its in 
vention in any the multifarious phenomena of 
interna as well m of external sense present on 
the opposite hypothesis nothing in any respect 
analogous to the substance to which they are 
attributed — nothing that can operate in any way 
even as the occasional cause from which the 
existence of such a substance could be suggested 
metaphysical philosophy may contain much that 
is groundless much that is deceptive but the 
whole analogy of deception and hypothesis in 
other branches of speculation leads to the con 
viction that it can only arise from rashly 
transferring to new relations ideas which are 
given in some relation or other 

instead therefore of considering the whole of 



 prolegomena logica 

metaphysics to be based on a delusion and its 
ultimate destiny to be utter extinction we shall 
probably come nearer to the truth if we regard 
its unsound portions as based on a perverted 
intuition and anticipate that it will be finally 
absorbed in that science to which the intuition 
in its original relation properly belongs if for 
example it should ultimately be made manifest 
that to the material world we have no relation 
except through the various phenomena of sense 
but that in the mental world self as well as the 
phenomena of self is an immediate presentation of 
consciousness it will follow that in the former we 
have no ground for maintaining the existence of 
things other than the phenomena presented and 
that consequently in this department ontology 
as distinct from phenomenology occupied solely 
with chimeras of our own invention whereas 
psychology being called upon to extend its in 
quiries from the phenomena of self to that of 
which they are phenomena will legitimately in 
clude the remaining portion of those problems 
which have hitherto been appropriated to meta 
physics 

but this question cannot be discussed here 
my present concern is only with the relation 
supposed to exist between metaphysics as above 
described and logic in the earlier form of

of contradiction and excluded middle which 
have been exhibited in a former chapter as laws

the former together with that of sufficient 
reason is placed by wolf the immediate pre 
decessor of kant at the head of ontology but 
after the kantian critique this association was 
no longer possible kant shewed clearly that 
without synthetical judgments a priori meta 
physical science is impossible and this at once 
put an end to all attempts which had hitherto 
been made to elicit a science of being from the 
laws of formal thinking which are the foundation 
of logic the two sciences thus divorced be 
come apparently united again in the system of 
hegel but the union is apparent only for 
the hegelian logic is based not on an acknow

thought it is a logic of the reason of which 
the fundamental position is that the laws of the 
understanding are applicable to finite objects

as regards its object not to the aristotelian

the method pursued is opposed to plato as much

advocate of that view who is far from adopting

union of metaphysics and logic to a lecture on 
the integral calculus and the rule of three

prolegomena logica 

a form of thought implies a certain relation between 
given objects — a relation which might be further 
elucidated if the nature of objects in general could 
be satisfactorily determined thus we have seen 
that the form of logical judgments and reasonings 
contains by implication those negative notions of 
substance and cause the investigation of which is 
the special object of metaphysical inquiries the 
science of metaphysics therefore if it could be 
constructed on a solid basis would furnish a 
criticism of those principles which are tacitly 
acknowledged in every mental process but for 
the purposes of formal logic such a criticism is 
not needed it is sufficient for that science to 
accept the principles in the obscure form in which 
they are acknowledged by common thought and 
common language especially as being indifferently 
implied in sound and unsound thinking they furnish 
no criterion by which we can distinguish the one 
from the other 

this view is confirmed by the history of philo 
sophy down to the present time while logic from 
the days of aristotle has been in possession of a 
scientific method and a definite contents whose 
truth whatever opinion may be entertained of their 
utility no critic has succeeded in impugning 
metaphysics has from the same period been equally 
conspicuous as the changing proteus of philosophy 
whose concealed wisdom sought after by ceaseless 
efforts of strength and countless varieties of artifice

has invariably eluded the inquiries of his wor 
shippers the union of the two so far from con 
tributing to the scientific completeness of the 
former has only served to mar its beauty and 
simplicity by extralogical details and to misrepre 
sent its true purpose and value by obscure intima 
tions of deeper mysteries lying hid beneath its 
apparent surface on the other hand in propor 
tion as the true character of logic as a science 
has become better known and appreciated it has 
gradually been separated from metaphysics and 
been associated with psychology as the science 
of the laws of thought it is absurd to expect that 
its object and character can be rightly estimated by 
those who are unacquainted with the nature and 
powers of the understanding itself — with its re 
lation to the cognate faculties and operations of 
the human mind — with its legitimate province and 
duties it is only in this connection that we can 
hope to see logic finally freed from the unsightly 
excrescences with which it has hitherto been de 
formed yet still retaining a clearly defined portion 
of valuable scientific truth and cultivated in a spirit 
of enlightened appreciation and criticism equally 
removed from the blind veneration of the idolater 
and the blind hostility of the iconoclast it is 
only in this connection that the boundaries of the 
two sciences can be clearly marked out and those 
portions of psychological matter and phraseology 
whose random introduction has contributed so 



prolegomena logica 

much to deface and obscure the pages of logical 
treatises can become of inestimable value as part 
and parcel of a cognate and complementary but 
by no means identical study and if in this asso 
ciation it becomes necessary to abase considerably 
the once towering ambition of the art of arts and 
science of sciences the loss is more than compen 
sated by the substitution of a humbler indeed but 
more attainable and more serviceable aim — the 
knowledge of the distinct provinces to be assigned 
to thought and experience respectively of the 
true value of each within its province and its 
worse than uselessness beyond — the knowledge 
of ourselves and our faculties of our true intel 
lectual wealth the nature of its tenure and the 
conditions of its lawful increase by such cultiva 
tion alone can we hope to see logic finally ex 
hibited in its true character and estimated at its 
true value neither encumbered with fictitious 
wealth by a spurious utilitarianism nor unprofit 
ably buried in the earth of an isolated and barren 
formalism

appendix 



note a p 

it is much to be regretted that dr whewell who has 
made good use of kantian principles in many parts of his 
 philosophy of the inductive sciences has not more 
accurately observed kants distinction between the neces 
sary laws under which all men think and the contingent 
laws under which certain men think of certain things 
his neglect of this distinction has given a seeming ad 
vantage to the empirical arguments of his antagonist 
mr mill who is thus enabled apparently to decide the 
question at issue by what is in reality no more than an 
argumentum ad hominem thus dr whewell says of 
certain discoveries of physical laws so complete has 
been the victory of truth in most of these instances that 
at present we can hardly imagine the struggle to have 
been necessary the very essence of these triumphs is 
that they lead us to regard the views we reject as not only 
false but inconceivable in this relation it is obvious 
that the inconceivability is with reference to the human 
mind merely contingent and relative to the particular 
studies of particular men before the days of copernicus 
men could not conceive the apparent motion of the sun 
on the heliocentric hypothesis the progress of science 
has reversed the difficulty but the progress of science 



 appendix 

itself is contingent on the will of certain men to apply 
themselves to it by thus endeavouring to exalt inductive 
laws of matter into b priori laws of mind dr whewell 
has unintentionally contributed to give an undue plausi 
bility to the opposite theory which reduces all laws of 
mind into the mere associations of this or that material 
experience 

but on psychological grounds it would seem as if the 
point of separation between priori principlesand empirical 
generalizations ought not to be very difficult of deter 
mination the difference is not one of degree but of 
kind and the separation between the two classes of truths 
is such that no conceivable progress of science can ever 
convert the one into the other that which is incon 
ceivable not accidentally from the peculiar circumstances 
of certain men but universally to all must be so in con 
sequence of an original law of the human mind that which 
is universally true within the field of experience indicates 
an original law of the material world no transformation 
of one into the other is possible unless the progress of 
science can change mind to matter or matter to mind 
it is therefore incumbent on the philosopher who would 
extend mathematical certainty to the domain of physical 
science to confirm in every instance his theory by a 
psychological deduction of his principles as kant has 
done in the instances of space and time 

dr whewell lays much stress on clearness and distinct 
ness of conceptions as the basis of the axiomatic truths of 
physical science but the clearness or distinctness of any 
conception can only enable us more accurately to unfold 
the virtual contents of the concept itself it cannot 
enable us to add priori any new attribute in other 
words the increased clearness and distinctness of a con 
ception may enable us to multiply to any extent our 



appendix sl 

analytical judgments but cannot add a single synthetical 
one without something more than this the philosopher 
has failed to meet the touchstone of the kantian question 
how are synthetical judgments a priori possible f 

the spirit of dr whewells philosophy of the in 
ductive sciences is beyond all praise in these days of 
positivism and empiricism it is refreshing to find a writer 
of such vast attainments in the details of physical science 
comprising them under such truly philosophical principles 
but it is to be regretted that the accuracy of his theory 
has been in some instances vitiated by a stumble on 
the threshold of the critical philosophy the distinction 
laid down by kant between the synthetical or properly 
geometrical and the analytical or general axioms seems 
to have been altogether overlooked thus almost at the 
outset of the philosophy of the inductive sciences the 
analytical judgment if equals are added to equals the 
wholes are equal is given as a condition of the intuition 
of magnitudes and the same oversight runs through the 
essay on mathematical reasoning in which he speaks of 
 selfevident principles not derived in any immediate 
manner from experiment but involved in the very nature 
of the conceptions which we must possess in order to reason 
upon such subjects at all the very nature of the con 
ceptions however clearly apprehended can give rise only 
to analytical judgments 

and such i think may be shewn to be the character 
of all the mechanical axioms derived from the idea of 
force of force apart from the conscious exertion of will 
we have no positive conception per se we know it only by 
its effects of equal forces we have no positive conception 
beyond that of the production of equal effects to assert 
therefore that equal forces will balance each other at the 

 book ii ch ix 



 appendix 

two extremities of a lever is to assert no more than that 
effects universally equal will be equal in any particular 
case b 

but to establish mechanics as an d priori science upon 
the idea of force it will be necessary to commence with 
some axioms at least of a synthetical character analogous 
to the geometrical principles two straight lines cannot 
enclose a space or if a straight line meets two straight 
lines so as to make the two interior angles on the same 
side together less than two right angles the two straight 
lines will meet if produced 

as a matter of fact i do not think that dr whewell 
has hitherto succeeded in establishing in the science of 

b we most distinguish between the general theoretical statement of this 
axiom and its practical application to any given object in geometry 
the axiom if equals are added to equals the wholes are equal is a mere 
analytical judgment derived from the principle oi identity but to ascertain 
whether two given magnitudes are equal is a question of experiment or 
observation so in mechanics the axiom that bodies acting with equal 
forces to turn a lever in opposite directions will retain it in equilibrium is 
analytical and as thus stated it is unnecessary to add either that the 
directions of both forces must be perpendicular or the arms of the lever 
equal but in any special application of the axiom there arises at once 
the question how can we ascertain that any two given forces are equal as 
forces acting upon the lever t if the force for example be gravity and two 
equal weights be suspended one perpendicularly the other obliquely the 
whole weight of the latter does not act to turn the lever in opposition to 
the former and the hypothesis of the axiom is violated the forces not 
being in that relation equal or if both are suspended perpendicularly 
but at unequal distances from the fulcrum the moments or forces in 
relation to the lever are not equal the axiom as stated by dr whewell 
 if two equal forces act perpendicularly at the extremities of equal arms of 
a straight line has the appearance of a synthetical judgment by compre 
hending under one formula the mere analysis of the notion of equal forces 
and the empirical determination of equality in any particular instance if 
by equal forces is meant forces equal in effect on the lever the axiom as 
stated by dr whewell is tautological if the meaning is forces equal in 
their effects in some other situation the axiom is empirical only and not 
even universally true but except by its effect in some situation or other 
what test have we of the magnitude of a force 



appendix 

mechanics a system of ct priori synthetical truths derived 
from the idea of force as distinct from those which are 
mere applications of the mathematical intuitions of time 
or space but as regards mere hypothetical mechanics 
such a system is not inconceivable a more exact psycho 
logical analysis of the intuitive faculties may possibly 
establish the existence of other subjective conditions of 
intuition besides those of space and time and conse 
quently of other synthetical judgments a priori besides 
those of geometry and arithmetic but when the same 
theory comes to be applied not to hypothetical rigid bodies 
without weight but to the actual phenomena of natural 
agents as in the demonstration that all matter is heavy 
and verbally at least in speaking of the inconceivability of 
the precopernican astronomy we see at once that the 
boundary is overleaped which separates the necessary laws 
of thought from the generalized phenomena of matter 
this absolute boundary is sufficiently marked no matter 
of fact can in any possible state of human knowledge be 
a matter of demonstration nay even supposing such 
a demonstration possible it would not add one tittle to 
the evidence of the fact as such in the eyes of any one 
but an egoist by him it would be accepted as an 
additional proof that what are commonly considered as 
phenomena of the nonego are really only modifications of 
the percipient mind and governed solely by mental laws 
but to the realist it would at most only suggest the pos 
sibility of a preestablished harmony between the laws of 
mind and matter — a suggestion which would require in 
every special case to be verified by the empirical ex 

 personality may perhaps be specified as another condition of this kind 
and the a priori principles of morals as consequent upon it on this i

amination of the latter mental laws which alone deter 
mine conceivability are primarily operative only on 
mental objects and are applicable to external things only 
on the hypothesis of their conformity this hypothesis 
can only be verified empirically that every triangle 
for example has its angles equal to two right angles is 
strictly true only of the perfect triangle as contemplated 
by the mind that this bit of paper lying before me has 
its angles equal to two right angles is only true on the 
supposition of its being a perfect triangle and the truth 
of this supposition in any possible state of perfection of 
human senses and instruments can only be determined 
empirically it remains always conceivable that there 
may be an error in the measurement and that the paper 
may not have exactly two right angles the probability 
of such an error may be diminished to any degree accord 
ing to the perfection of our means of measurement but 
no approximation of this kind can ever become absolute 
certainty 

it is not without some hesitation that i have ventured 
thus far to criticise a work which i believe to be in 
its whole spirit and conception by far the most valuable 
contribution of modern times to the philosophy of the 
physical sciences to those who would survey this 
branch of knowledge in a sound philosophical spirit alike 
removed from the idealism of schelling and from the 
positivism of comte the writings of dr whewell are 
especially valuable to those who believe with the 
present writer that the future hopes of speculative 
philosophy rest on the possibility of a union of the 
critical principles of kant with the sober practical spirit 
 which is characteristic of english thinkers the writings 
of the same author afford one of the most cheering 
assurances that the spirit of philosophy under all its

discouragements is not yet extinct in this country 
with this declaration the spirit that has dictated the 
preceding criticism will not i trust be misunderstood 



note bp 

that berkeley was fully aware of the inconsequence of 
the conclusions which hume afterwards attempted to 
draw from his principles is manifest from the third 
dialogue between hylas and philonous in which he meets 
by anticipation the argument of the sceptic by maintain 
ing that we are directly conscious of our own being he 
is wrong indeed in calling this consciousness reflection 
this term being properly applicable only to attention 
directed to our internal phenomena — an attention which 
does not make known but presupposes the attending 
self but when he asserts know or am conscious of 
my own being and that i myself am not my ideas but 
somewhat else a thinking active principle that perceives 
knows wills and operates about ideas he states the 
true ground on which we may refute the sceptical con 



 the preceding note remains nearly as it appeared in the first edition 
of this work published in since that time some additional 
remarks on the matter in question have appeared in sir william 
hamiltons discussions p second edition p in dr whewells 
letter to the author of prolegomena loyica and in the authors pamphlet 
in reply entitled the limits of demonstrative science considered sir w 
hamiltons view is substantially the same as my own and i cannot help 
regarding this independent coincidence as a confirmation of my original 
criticism at the same time i feel bound to express my acknowledg 
ments to dr whewell for the instruction which his letter has afforded 
me and for the liberal and courteous tone in which his objections 
are urged 

f this part of berkeleys dialogue is meant as an answer to locke 
essay b ii ch but the same reasoning is also valid against 
hume 



 appendix 

elusions of hume indeed this part of the dialogue 
wants little more than a more complete exposition of the 
nature of the will to anticipate in principle the position 
afterwards taken against the great sceptic by maine de 
biran 

the weak side of berkeleys idealism is not to be found 
in its relation to hume but in its relation to fichte 
the object proposed by berkeley was to get rid of the 
contradictions and difficulties contained in the notion of 
matter as existing distinct from mind and thus to leave 
the existence of minds divine and human beyond question 
for this purpose he availed himself of two arguments 
one of which was borrowed from the cartesian philosophy 
the other was added by himself 

the cartesians denying the possibility of any direct 
influence of matter upon mind or of mind upon matter 
explained the phenomena of perception by the hypo 
thesis of divine assistance and occasional causes 
according to this theory the mental phenomena of 
sensation are not produced by any direct action of body 
upon mind but by the immediate agency of god who 
produces certain sensations in the conscious mind upon 
the occasion of certain corresponding movements in the 
bodily organism berkeley while denying the existence 
of matter and therefore rejecting the supposition of a 
bodily occasional cause retained the cartesian theory so 
far as to maintain that the presence of ideas in the mind 
is caused by the direct agency of the deity thus he 
says when in broad daylight i open my eyes it is 
not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no

appendix 

or to determine what particular objects shall present 
themselves to my view and so likewise as to the 
hearing and other senses the ideas imprinted on them 
are not creatures of my will there is therefore some 
other will or spirit that produces them 

with this argument which represents god as the 
efficient cause of our ideas berkeley combined another 
in which the deity is regarded as a constantly perceiving 
mind accepting as allowed on all hands the opinion 
that sensible qualities cannot subsist by themselves and 
rejecting the ordinary hypothesis of their existence in 
an insensible substratum he concluded that they must 
therefore exist in a mind which perceives them and that 
they have no existence apart from being perceived 
if therefore they continue to exist when we do not 
perceive them and that they do so is the irresistible 
conviction of all men they must be perceived by some 
other mind hence the continuous duration of things 
implies the existence of a constantly percipient mind 
that is of ood 

the relation between the divine and the human mind 
as thus conceived may be adapted either to a presentative 
or to a representative theory of idealism we may hold 
that the ideas perceived at any particular time by a given 
man are numerically one with those constantly perceived 
by the divine mind or we may regard them as having 
only a specific identity the former being the copy and 
the latter the archetype under the first hypothesis 
the divine ideas are presented to us as the direct objects 
of our perception under the second they are represented

by similar ideas excited in ourselves the former theory 
though susceptible of various developments in detail is 
in principle that of vision in god and is accordingly 
distinctly maintained by malebranche who asserts that 
a thousand men can see the same individual object 
namely the intelligible extension which is perceived in 
god k berkeley by rejecting the theory of malebranche 
was logically driven to the representative hypothesis 
though his language occasionally wavers between the 
two 

but to make this hypothesis the foundation of a 
theistic argument it is necessary to retain as berkeley 
in fact did retain the supposition of a real distinction 
between the idea or object perceived and the mind 
perceiving the idea though existing only as perceived 
and in the act of perception must yet not be identified 
with that act nor regarded as a mere modification or 
mode of being of the percipient mind if this simpler 
form of representationism be once adopted the legitimate 
inference is not theism but pantheism the ideas of 
which i am conscious being admitted to exist only as 
modes of my own being it is concluded by parity of 
reasoning that the archetypal world exists only in the 
form of various modes of the being of god 

and such is in fact the form which idealism assumes 
in the hands of fichte and schelling the theory of

 i mast acknowledge my obligations to professor webb the author of 
 the lntellectualism of locke both for the instruction derived from bis 
able and interesting work and also for some unpublished communications 
on berkeleys philosophy of winch i have availed myself in revising this 
note for the present edition at the same time i am unable to agree with 
him in regarding lockes and berkeleys theory of ideas as identical with 
that of amauld in which the representative idea is regarded as a modi 
fication of the mind indeed in berkeleys system the relation of substance 
and mode has properly no place 



appendix 

perceptions essentially representative which virtually 
regards the act and its immediate object as produced 
by the inherent power of the mind itself was not in 
arnaulds hands carried into any consequences beyond 
those required by his controversy with malebranche 
but a similar theory in the hands of the german philo 
sophers became the basis first of an absolute egoism 
and finally of an absolute pantheism consciousness 
being only possible in the form of this or that special 
modification it is but one step further to regard the true 
substance as an unmodified substratum existing out of 
consciousness though manifested only in the conscious 
ness of its several modes we have thus the absolute 
ego of fichte and by a still further generalization the 
absolute being of schelling which as the one substance 
from which personal and impersonal phenomena alike 
proceed may indifferently be called ego or god the 
conscious self and the objects of its consciousness being 
but opposite modes of the divine one and all 

nor will the idealism of berkeley however opposed 
to these conclusions offer any effectual barrier against 
them the distinction between ideas existing as objects 
in the mind and ideas existing as modes of the mind 
 is too slight to stand against that tendency to simpli 
fication which forms at once the chief virtue and the 
chief vice of philosophical speculation the natural 
judgment of mankind which affirms the knowledge of 
an external world existing independently of perception 
being once abandoned the only question which remains 
is how to account for the phenomena on the simplest 
hypothesis and the simplest hypothesis is that which 
postulates only one real existence underlying the multi 
plicity of phenomena the hypothesis whose various 
subordinate theories all finally converge in pantheism 



 appendix 

these consequences can only be avoided by abandoning 
the idealistic theory and substituting a natural realism 
dualism though it be admit with berkeley that the 
real things are those very things which i see and feel and 
perceive by my senses but deny his other main position 
that the mind perceives only its own ideas we may 
thus open the way for the direct recognition in conscious 
ness first of our own organism as extended and secondly 
of an external world in relation to that organism on 
this theory we may get rid of the metaphysical distinction 
between phenomena and noumena or between repre 
sentation and things in themselves the immediate object 
of perception is the thing and the representation is not 
opposed to the unperceived thing in itself but to the 
presentation or thing as given in immediate relation to 
the conscious subject 

another weak point of berkeleys philosophy is his 
theory of the nature of belief he considers that real 
things differ from chimeras in being more vivid and clear 
and not dependent on the will this accords with humes 
definition of belief a lively idea related to or associated 
with a present impression but the will is completely 
inactive in a dream and phantasms may be as lively and 
vivid when excited by a fiction as by a true relation the 
truth is that belief cannot be defined being presupposed 
in all consciousness every act of consciousness is a judg 
ment and therefore a belief in the presence of its object 
the question of reality or unreality depends upon where 
and how we judge it to be present if an object present 
to the imagination is declared to be present to the sense 
the judgment is false but the object is unreal only if by 
real we mean sensible all presentations as such may be 
called real relatively to their proper intuition and unreal

appendix 

relatively to any other the further question which of 
our intuitions indicate the presence of external objects 
and which are merely affections of the mind or the 
sensitive organism is one which however important 
on the realist hypothesis is out of place in a system of 
idealism 



note c p 

the following is sir william hamiltons analysis of 
the causal judgment as the result of the mental law of 
the conditioned the phenomenon is this — when 
aware of a new appearance we are unable to conceive that 
therein has originated any new existence and are there 
fore constrained to think that what now appears to us 
under a new form had previously an existence under 
others — others conceivable by us or not these others 
for they are always plural are called its cause and a 
cause or more properly causes we cannot but suppose 
for a cause is simply every thing without which the effect 
would not result and all such concurring the effect 
cannot but result we are utterly unable to construe it 
in thought as possible that the complement of existence 
has been either increased or diminished we cannot 
conceive either on the one hand nothing becoming 
something or on the other something becoming nothing 
when god is said to create the universe out of nothing 
we think this by supposing that he evolves the universe 
out of nothing but himself and in like manner we 
conceive annihilation only by conceiving the creator 
to withdraw his creation by withdrawing his creative 
energy from actuality into power 

d for some remarks on this question see the authors article meta 
phytics in the eighth edition of the encyclopaedia britannica p

 appendix 

 our judgment of causality he continues simply 
i — we necessarily deny or rather are unable to affirm 
in thought that the object which we apprehend as 
beginning to be really so begins but on the contrary 
affirm as we must the identity of its present sum of 
being with the sum of its past existence — and here it 
is not requisite for us to know or even to be able to 
conceive under what form or under what combination 
this quantum previously existed in other words it is 
unnecessary for us to recognise the particular causes of 
this particular effect a discovery of the determinate 
antecedents into which a determinate consequent may be 
refunded is merely contingent— merely the result of 
experience but the judgment that every event should 
have its causes is necessary and imposed on us as a 
condition of our human intelligence itself this necessity 
of so thinking is the only phenomenon to be explained 
the question of philosophy is not concerning the cause 
but concerning a cause 

such is sir w hamiltons statement of the phe 
nomenon the following is his explanation of it 

 the phenomenon of causality seems nothing more 
than a corollary of the law of the conditioned in its 
application to a thing thought under the form or mental 
category of existence relative in time we cannot 
know we cannot think a thing except under the attri 
bute of existence we cannot know or think a thing to 
exist except as in time and we cannot know or think 
a thing to exist in time and think it absolutely to com 
mence or terminate now this at once imposes on us the 
judgment of causality unable positively to think an 
absolute commencement our impotence to this drives us 
backwards on the notion of cause unable positively to 

o discussions p d edition 



appendix 

think an absolute termination our impotence to this 
drives us forwards on the notion of effect we are 
compelled he continues to believe that the object 
that is the certain quale and quantum of being whose 
phenomenal rise into existence we have witnessed did 
realty exist prior to this rise under other forms and 
by for™ be it observed i mean any mode of existence 
conceivable by us or not but to say that a thing 
previously existed under different forms is only to say 
in other words that a thing had causes it would be 
here out of place to refute the error of philosophers in 
supposing that any thing can have a single cause— 
meaning always by a cause that without which the effect 
would not have been i speak of course only of second 
causes for of the divine causation we can pretend to no 
conception 

to these extracts from sir w hamiltons discussions 
may be added a short passage from the appendix to his 
lectures on metaphysics containing his latest explanation 
of his theory causation is therefore necessarily within 
existence for we cannot think of a change either from 
nonexistence to existence or from existence to non 
existence the thought of power therefore always 
precedes that of creation and follows that of anni 
hilation and as the thought of power always involves 
the thought of existence therefore in so far as the 
thoughts of creation and annihilation go the necessity 
of thinking a cause for these changes exemplifies the 
facts — that change is only from one form of existence 
to another and that causation is simply our inability to 
think an absolute commencement or an absolute termi 
nation of being the sum of being actual and potential 
now extant in the mental and material worlds together

with that in their creator and the sum of being actual 
and potential in the creator alone before and after those 
worlds existed is necessarily thought as precisely the 
same take the instance of a neutral salt this is an 
effect the product of various causes — and all are neces 
sarily powers we have here an acid involving its 
power active or passive of combining with the alkali 
 an alkali involving its power active or passive of 
combining with the acid since as the chemical 
brocard has it corpora non agunt nisi soluta a fluid 
say water with its power of dissolving and holding in 
solution the acid and alkali a translative power say 
the human hand capable of bringing the acid the alkali 
and the water into correlation or within the sphere of 
mutual affinity these and they might be subdivided 
are all causes of the effect for abstract any one and the 
salt is not produced it wants a coefficient cause and 
the concurrence of every cause is requisite for an effect 
in describing the above four conditions as all in 
different ways causes of the effect sir w hamilton 
will probably meet with the concurrence of most of his 
readers but the further statement that these causes are 
all forms under which the effect previously existed will 
probably strike them as being at least verbally different 
from the common view most men would readily admit 
that the acid and the alkali and the portion of water 
necessary for combining them are but previous forms 
of the salt itself but they would hesitate to admit the 
hand or its action into the same list in other words 
they would allow that the earlier and the later sub 
stances are identical in the material particles of which 
they are composed but they would insist on distin 
guishing these particles from the efficient cause by which 
the composition is effected but when the identity is 



appendix 

stated in this way the judgment assumes a totally new 
character whether it be true or not that we cannot 
conceive the quantity of existence to be increased or 
diminished there is at any rate no such inability as 
regards the quantity of matter it may be true as a 
fact that no material atom has been added to the world 
since the first creation but the assertion however true 
is certainly not necessary the power which created 
once must be conceived as able to create again whether 
that ability is actually exercised or not 

the same conclusion is still more evident when we pro 
ceed from the consideration of matter to that of mind 
of matter we maintain that the creation of new portions 
is perfectly conceivable as a result at least if not as 
a process of mind we believe that such creation actually 
takes place every man who comes into the world comes 
into it as a distinct individual having a personality 
and consciousness of his own and that personality is a 
distinct accession to the number of persons previously 
existing whatever may be thought concerning the 
material particles of which my body is composed it 
cannot be maintained that i as a person had a previous 
existence in the personality of my parents however i 
may regard them as the causes of my being 

if then we are to identify the effect with the sum of 
its causes we must rise above the conceptions of matter 
as matter and of mind as mind and rise to the highest 
abstraction of existence in general which is not any 
particular existence the sum of being actual and 
potential now extant in the mental and material worlds 
together with that in their creator and the sum of being 
actual and potential in the creator alone before and 
after those worlds existed is necessarily thought as 
precisely the same this assertion involves a previous 



 appendix 

question is being in this abstract form necessarily 
thought as a sum at all or indeed necessarily thought 
in any way 

it is admitted that we not only can conceive but 
actually know by experience the origination of new 
forms of existence it is questioned whether these forms 
are regarded as new existences but strip off the form 
and what is left to constitute the existence the world 
as a world is not identical with its creator the creator 
as a creator is not identical with the world the identity 
if it is admitted at all can only be admitted as regards 
an unmodified substratum of existence in general which 
is no existence in particular but existence as an 
abstract substratum of this kind is to human thought 
absolute zero thus far the hegelian paradox is true 
pure being is pure nothing when we have abstracted 
from the world all that distinguishes it as a world and 
from the creator all that distinguishes him as a creator 
we have nothing left to constitute the identity of ex 
istence from the mere general statement that cause 
and effect both exist we have no more right to say 
that they are the same existence than from the general 
statement that they both appear we have a right to 
say that they are the same phenomenon 

our conception of existence as of appearance is not 
singular but plural we are not conscious of existence 
in general but of existing things as we are not con 
scious of appearance in general but of apparent objects 
the two may not indeed be always regarded as coex 
tensive diversity of phenomena does not always imply 
diversity of existence but neither on the other hand 
does it always imply identity of existence the primary 
fact of consciousness the distinction between the ego 
and the nonego is a distinction not of phenomena but 



appendix 

of realities i know myself as a distinctly existing 
being — indeed it is probably from that knowledge that 
my conception of being as distinguished from appearance 
is derived — and i know the external world as something 
different from myself arguing by analogy from this 
primary conviction i believe every man to be a distinct 
being from every other man and from all the other 
objects around him and i believe that every new person 
that comes into the world is as a person a new existence 
how far the same distinction may be extended to im 
personal objects is another question for in these we have 
no immediate knowledge of any principium individuations 
constituting a single reality out of this or that aggregate 
of phenomena but if we are unable to affirm the 
existence of such a principle we are also unable to 
deny it and hence we are not justified in asserting that 
all phenomena are but different modes of one and the 
same reality 

from this point of view the conception of potential 
existence on which sir w hamiltons theory mainly 
depends vanishes altogether if our conception of ex 
istence like all other conceptions is subject to the 
conditions of plurality and difference— if we have no 
conception of being at all except in the form of this 
being as distinguished from that — it follows that where 
the definite characteristics of this or that being are 
absent the being itself has no existence in any form 
the mere possibility of the existence of a man is not 
the existence of the man under another form for the 
man as such has no existence except in the particular 
form by which he is actually constituted to say that 
every thing which begins had a previous existence in 
another form is to say that the form is no part of the 
existence — a position which necessarily leads us back 



 appendix 

to the eleatic theory of the unity of all things and 
identifies existence with indifference 

if these objections are tenable the common statement 
of the causal judgment in which the cause is regarded 
as something different from the effect is more accurate 
and more in accordance with the philosophy of the 
conditioned than that of sir w hamilton in which 
the cause is regarded as identical with the effect both 
statements equally repudiate the absurdity of supposing 
existence to have originated from absolute zero for 
both alike suppose that nothing can begin to exist 
unless something had previously existed the question 
between them is merely this is this something a dif 
ferent existence or only the same existence in another 
form 

neither on the one supposition nor on the other do 
we obtain any positive conception of the nature of 
causation beyond that which is furnished by and limited 
to our own volitions mere temporal antecedence of 
one thing to another is not the whole of causation any 
more than the mere antecedence of the same thing under 
other forms we are compelled still to ask what is that 
peculiar relation between antecedent and consequent 
by which the one gives birth to the other or is changed 
into the other the origination of the consequent by 
the antecedent and the evolution of the actual from the 
potential alike require a further cause to account for 
them and this causative energy call it by what name 
you will power effort tendency still remains absolutely 
unknown but is still supposed as absolutely indis 
pensable

noted p 

the following is mr mills argument for the subjection 
of the human will to the law of physical causation to 
the universality which mankind are agreed in ascribing to 
the law of causation there is one claim of exception 
one disputed case that of the human will the deter 
minations of which a large class of metaphysicians are not 
willing to regard as following the causes called motives 
according to as strict laws as those which they suppose 
to exist in the world of mere matter this controverted 
point will undergo a special examination when we come 
to treat particularly of the logic of the moral sciences 
in the mean time i may remark that these metaphy 
sicians who it must be observed ground the main part 
of their objection upon the supposed repugnance of the 
doctrine in question to our consciousness seem to me to 
mistake the fact which consciousness testifies against 
what is really in contradiction to consciousness they 
would i think on strict selfexamination find to be the 
application to human actions and volitions of the ideas 
involved in the common use of the term necessity which 
i agree with them in thinking highly objectionable but 
if they would consider that by saying that a mans actions 
necessarily follow from his character all that is really 
meant for no more is meant in any case whatever of 
causation is that he invariably does act in conformity to 
his character and that any one who thoroughly knew his 
character could certainly predict how he would act in any 
supposable case they probably would not find this doc 
trine either contrary to their experience or revolting to 
their feelings and no more than this is contended for 
by any one but an asiatic fatalist 

r mills logic vol i p 



 appendix 

and no more than this we might add is needed to 
construct a system of fatalism as rigid as any asiatic can 
desire but we must proceed to mr mills further 
remarks in the logic of the moral sciences in this 
latter portion of his work the author has done little 
more than repeat his belief that the law of causality 
applies in the same strict sense to human actions as to 
other phenomena involving in both cases not constraint 
but invariable certain and unconditional sequence 
so that given the motives which are present to an 
individuals mind and given likewise the character and 
disposition of the individual the manner in which he will 
act may be unerringly inferred that if we knew the 
person thoroughly and knew all the inducements which 
are acting upon him we could foretell his conduct with 
as much certainty as we can predict any physical event 
he adds a distinction intended to rescue his theory from 
the charge of fatalism as usually implied in the term 
necessity that word in its other acceptations involves 
much more than mere uniformity of sequence it implies 
irresistibleness applied to the will it only means that 
the given cause will be followed by the effect subject to 
all possibilities of counteraction by other causes but in 
common use it stands for the operation of those causes 
exclusively which are supposed too powerful to be coun 
teracted at all the causes therefore he continues 
 on which action depends are never uncontrollable 
and any given effect is only necessary provided that the 
causes tending to produce it are not controlled that 
whatever happens could not have happened otherwise 
unless something had taken place which was capable of 
preventing it no one surely needs hesitate to admit 

that there is some fundamental weakness in the above 
 mills logic book vi chap 



appendix 

theory appears almost on the surface from the fact that 
so acute a thinker as mr mill can imagine that he has 
saved the principle of causality from the charge of 
fatalism by this concluding sentence that whatever 
happens could not have happened otherwise unless some 
thing had taken place capable of preventing it is indeed 
in one sense a perfectly harmless position but also a 
perfectly unproductive one it is the mere truism of the 
nursery rhyme 

 there was an old woman lived under a hill 
u and jf she not gone she lives there still 

examine it closer and the question at once arises whence 
is this counteracting something to come if from myself 
from a selfdetermined act of free will this concedes the 
whole question at issue if from an act of will deter 
mined by preexisting causes or altogether from without 
i am still in the iron grasp of necessity if the pre 
venting circumstance come whence it may comes as the 
certain sequence of antecedent phenomena i am still the 
slave of circumstances if otherwise the whole resemblance 
between moral and physical causation vanishes 

but let us go up to the fundamental principle of the 
theory itself the conduct of a man we are told is the 
invariable consequent of motives present to his mind so 
that given the motives and the mans character we could 
certainly predict the action character it must be ob 
served is not here to be understood in aristotles sense 
as a disposition caused by a series of voluntary acts it 
must be something coeval with the first act of socalled 
volition at the earliest period at which i am capable of 
acting i possess a character of some sort and that cha 
racter together with the motives presented determines 
certainly how i shall act 

the plausibility of the theory arises from an ambiguity 



 appendix 

in the term motive in knowing the phenomena present 
to a mans mind at the moment of any act of volition is 
it included that we are to know their relation to his will 
if so the supposed prediction is a mere begging of the 
question when i know how he will be inclined to act 
i know how he will act if not the advocate of the 
doctrine must succumb to the sophism of the asinus 
buridani and concede that the unfortunate animal be 
tween two bundles of hay exactly alike must starve 
the solution of this sophism supposing of course that 
the ass in that instance represents a voluntary and not 
merely a spontaneous agent is likewise the solution of 
mr mills argument what is meant by two bundles of 
hay exactly alike they must be indistinguishable by 
sight smell touch and so forth but are objects exactly 
similar as regards the senses therefore exactly similar as 
regards the will a lump of salt and a lump of sugar 
may be similar to the eye are they therefore similar to 
the palate if taste is not dependent upon another sense 
why may not will be independent of all the senses if 
on the other hand the two bundles of hay are to be 
exactly similar as motives in relation to the will the 
argument amounts to the mere truism that if the ass 
does not choose one he will choose neither 

exactly the same fallacy runs through mr mills theory 
of the causality of actions the socalled motives are 
either a set of phenomena viewed in their relation to the 
will or viewed out of that relation if the former the 
argument has long ago been refuted by reid the 
strongest motive prevails but i only know the strength 
of motives in relation to the will by the test of ultimate 
prevalence so that this means no more than that the 
prevailing motive prevails i have no measure of strength 
 active powers essay ir ph p ed hamilton 



appendix 

but its effects i only know certain things to be motives 
at all by the fact of their ultimate prevalence if on the 
other hand the phenomena are considered out of their 
relation to the will my consciousness testifies at once 
that my actions are not subject to the same invariable 
sequence as physical changes i know that is whenever 
i lift my arm to my head that it is at that moment in my 
power not to lift it and that the antecedent circum 
stances being precisely the same i may decide not to do 
so at any future time but says mr mill this decision 
of the will is itself a new antecedent certainly a new 
antecedent to the act but with what propriety can it be 
called a new antecedent to itself t the question is not 
whether the act of motion follows certainly upon that of 
volition but whether the act of volition follows certainly 
upon antecedent circumstances the former sequence 
depends on purely physical laws and the preventing 
causes such as a stroke of paralysis are purely physical 
also but if the latter sequence is invariable also wc 
admit not one new phenomenon but millions since an 
opposite determination of the will can only come in with 
its determinant and the determinant of that determinant 
and so on ad infinitum for to suppose that two opposite 
volitions can follow from the same determinant is incom 
patible with the whole hypothesis of causality if on the 
other hand the sequence of volition from given ante 
cedents is variable what becomes of the power of pre 
dicting a mans actions the contingency of a single 
link affects all the subsequent portion of the chain 
in reply then to the question are our volitions like 

¦ mr mill says the wish is a new antecedent if this term is meant 
to be synonymous with vrill it would be an improvement in language to 
change it if it is meant to be synonymous with desire the confusion of 
desire with will vitiates his whole argument 



 appendix 

other events the result of causes certainly not in the 
only intelligible senses of the term i have only two 
positive notions of causation one the exertion of power 
by an intelligent being the other the uniform sequence 
of phenomenon b from a a may here stand for a single 
phenomenon or a group for that antecedent or sum of 
antecedents which constitutes the sufficient reason 
the former hypothesis is fatalism if mywill results 
from the coercion of some other intelligence i am the 
slave of destiny the latter hypothesis is determinism 
a necessity no less rigid than fatalism besides being at 
variance with the whole testimony of consciousness and 
with the experience of every day besides these two 
there is no alternative but to admit in the fullest sense 
the freedom of the will by denying the applicability of 
the principle of causality to human actions 

this objection if not removed says mr mill would 
be fatal to the attempt to treat human conduct as a subject 
of science be it so it is better to accept the conse 
quence than to admit the alternative but it is fatal only 
according to mr mills view of science ethology as he 
conceives it in relation to individuals as the science of 
characters as they must be according to laws of physical 
and mental causation i do believe to be in its idea and 
pretensions chimerical but ethics as the science of such 
characters as they ought to be according to the laws of 
moral obligation remains undisturbed or rather more 
securely established it seems to be forgotten by writers 
of this school that these two systems are absolutely 
exclusive of each other that physical causation and moral 
obligation cannot in perfection exist side by side and 
that where they do coexist each must be in the inverse 
ratio of the other in proportion as we extend the 
domain of necessity we must diminish that of duty 



appendix s 

and necessity notwithstanding all that mr mill has 
advanced i still believe to be the inevitable result of 
subjecting moral acts to the laws of physical causation 
but ethology in relation to classes of men as affected by 
national professional educational physiological or even 
moral circumstances may notwithstanding attain to a vast 
amount of important practical principles and rules though 
still subject to the influence of individual contingency 
the actuary of an insurance company if he were to 
predict the duration of life of any one individual on the 
books of his office would in all probability guess wrong — 
as a matter of fact it is true mainly from his ignorance of 
physical circumstances but as a matter of theory also if 
we allow that the individual in question may falsify the 
prediction by a voluntary act of suicide but if the same 
experiment is tried on a sufficiently large scale opposite 
errors will counteract each other and the general ap 
proximate result attains almost to a moral certainty 
the general results of ethology as applied to classes are 
dependent in a great degree on similar circumstances and 
may attain to the same or a higher amount of practical 
utility 

in the course of the above remarks i have purposely 
avoided touching on a subject alluded to by mr mill the 
compatibility of mans freewill with gods foreknowledge 
this question is insoluble because we have nothing but 
negative notions to apply to it to enable us to determine 
the exact manner in which an infinite intelligence con 
templates succession in time it would be necessary that 
our intelligence should be infinite also in this as in 
all other revelations of gods relation to man we must 
be content to believe without aspiring to comprehend

us the manner he has left in darkness and we cannot

the necessitarian theory has recently been stated anew 
in two works both of high ability and reputation but 
written in very different spirits and with very different 
purposes the author of the first of these works while 
professedly writing in the name and in support of the 
principles of necessitarianism strenuously asserts at the 
same time the apparently opposite doctrine of the freedom 
of the will and the responsibility of man and writes with 
the avowed purpose of reconciling these seemingly con 
flicting beliefs the author of the second work pushes

his principles to a conclusion which cannot be otherwise 
understood than as exonerating human actions from all 
voluntariness and their agents from all responsibility 
the former of these works dr m c coshs method of 
the divine government is one from which i cannot 
dissent without extreme reluctance regarding it as i do 
as one of the most valuable contributions to christian 
philosophy which the present age has produced with 
many of the authors remarks on the present question 
i fully concur and in others i am inclined to hope that 
the difference between us is more verbal than real 
but there are some of his statements which even if not 
substantially erroneous in themselves may lead to error 
from their language and its associations 

dr m e coh takes his position as a necessitarian on 
the ground that the principle of cause and effect reigns 
in the domains of mind as in the territories of matter 
thus he considers the doctrine of necessity to be founded 
 on one of the very intellectual intuitions of mans mind 
which leads us in mental as in material phenomena to 
anticipate the same effects to follow he same causes 
of this intellectual intuition he says in another part of 
his work in regard to any one thought or feeling we 
affirm that it must have had a cause in some property 
of the mind or in some antecedent state of the mind 
or in the two combined it is by an intuition of our 
nature that we believe that this thought or feeling could 
not have been produced without a cause and that this 
same cause will again and for ever produce the same 
effects and this intuitive principle leads us to expect 
the reign of causation not only among the thoughts 
and feelings generally but among the wishes and volitions 
of the soul

 appendix 

i cannot help thinking that what dr mcosh here 
describes as an intuitive principle of the mind is in 
fact a combination of two principles differing both in 
their nature and in their origin that a given pheno 
menon whether material or mental could not have 
been produced without a cause is one assertion that 
 this same cause will again and for ever produce the same 
effects is another setting aside for the moment what 
we know empirically of the uniformity of nature it is 
perfectly conceivable that the world might have been 
so constituted that there should be no regularity in the 
succession of events but that the same cause which at 
one time is followed by a particular effect should at 
another have no such consequence the latter portion 
therefore of dr m c coshs principle is not entitled to 
rank among the original intuitions of the mind because 
even if experience assures us that as a matter of fact 
it never is violated we have no difficulty in conceiving 
that it may be 

but when the knowledge of the uniformity of nature 
is discarded what remains to constitute the intuitive 
principle row much or how little is implied in the 
mere conviction that every phenomenon must have a 
cause on the particular occasion of its occurrence if we 
know nothing about similarity of recurrence in the 
first place with regard to voluntary and involuntary 
phenomena alike it is implied that som other pheno 
menon has immediately preceded this is a necessary 
consequence of the subjection of our consciousness to 
the law of time in the next place with regard to 
voluntary actions alone of which i am the cause it is 
implied that at the moment of doing them i am con 
scious of being able to abstain from them and this is 
an immediate consciousness of power in the proper 



appendix 

sense of the term in the third place with regard to 
involuntary occurrences there is the assumption of an 
unknown something in the antecedent phenomenon ana 
logous to the productive power in voluntary agents 
this unknown something however is not power in the 
only form in which we are conscious of it nay it is 
the direct negation of it for power is positively con 
ceived only in the form of ability to choose between two 
alternatives b 

it seems then that the apparent universality of the 
axiom every event must have a cause is partly 
due to the ambiguity of its terms define clearly what 
is meant by a cause and the general axiom is at once 
divided into two special ones i am the cause of my 
actions inasmuch as i do them voluntarily with a power 
at the same time to abstain from them in this sense 
we cannot speak of a cause in relation to the pheno 
mena of matter it is not in this sense that the heat 
of the fire is the cause of the melting of the wax on 
the other hand in the sense in which hume and brown 
define a cause it is applicable to material phenomena 
but not to voluntary actions a cause in the sense 
of these philosophers means some one invariable ante 



¦ see above p 

b dr m c cosh p maintains that power is implied in oar very 
idea of substance and that this power these properties of substances 
are permanently in them and ready to be exercised at all times but 
power in this sense is not an idea distinct from the actual sequence 
of the effect it is merely that sequence viewed hypothetical when 
i speak of the power of fire to melt wax that power not being in 
actual exercise i mean no more than that the melting would follow 
if the wax were exposed to it in this sense we know nothing of power 
or property except as the manifestation of an effect hypothetical or 
actual moreover power in this sense as a permanent property involves 
the empirical idea of the uniformity of nature as well as the move 
conception of a substance as existing

cedent or group of antecedents the presence of which 
is always followed by the phenomenon in question in 
this sense if cannot be asserted that the determinations 
of the will have a cause meaning that the will is always 
determined in a similar manner by the presence of 
similar antecedent circumstances or thirdly if we 
discard the conception of invariability the axiom indeed 
becomes universal but does not amount to an assertion 
of a cause it then asserts positively no more than 
that every phenomenon has some other preceding it i e 
that no given phenomenon can be conceived as standing 
at the beginning of all time the unknown something 
which we term power in the cause to produce its effect 
can neither be included in this universal assertion nor 
referred to an original intuition of the mind for there 
can be no intuition of that which is unknown and no 
universality in that which is denied of one class of actions 
in the only sense in which it is affirmed of another 

but it is urged on the other side that human actions 
can be calculated beforehand and therefore are clearly 
subject to the operation of law we anticipate says 
dr m c cosh the voluntary actions of mankind as we 
anticipate their judgments no doubt we are at times 
mistaken in the one case as in the other in our anti 
cipations but we do not in these cases conclude that the 
voluntary actions of mankind have had no cause any 
more than we infer that their judgments have had no 
cause — we conclude merely that we did not know the 
cause and that if we had known the full cause we could 
have certainly anticipated the result there are statistics 
of the voluntary actions of mankind — as of crimes for 
instance — which are as accurate as the laws of mortality 
this statement would be a sufficient answer to a theory

of complete indifference which regards the will as entirely 
uninfluenced by motives up to the time when its choice 
is made but it does not meet the objections of those 
who while fully allowing the influence of motives yet 
maintain that that influence is different in its nature from 
any relation of material phenomena and therefore should 
not be called by the same name doubtless there are 
general anticipations to be drawn from mental inclinations 
no less than from physical successions if i throw a 
piece of wax into the fire i expect that it will melt 
if i offer money to an avaricious man i expect that he 
will take it the question is is the expectation in both 
cases equally certain or is the difference only such a 
can be accounted for by our greater or less knowledge of 
circumstances to assume this is to beg the entire 
question and on the strength of this assumption to 
call both relations by the common name of causation is 
only to confound together two different things under an 
ambiguity of language d 

dr mcosh himself admits the existence of a self 
activity of the will which if it means any thing means 
a power of resisting or yielding to the motives presented 
to it and of resisting at one time and yielding at another 
the concurrent circumstances being identical on both 

d if in moral reasoning it be mere mockery to use the language of 
demonstration and to build up systems by trains of d priori reasoning 
upon a single principle it is assuredly not less absurd to affect the forms 
of inductive proof in political speculation every political as well as 
every moral principle practically involves the determination of the will 
and thereby becomes at once separated from that class of investigations in 
which we consider the immutable relations of physical phenomena that 
the will is influenced by motives no one pretends to deny— but to compare 
that influence to a physical cause followed by an unvaried physical effect 
is only to confound things essentially different and must ever end in

in the other work to which i have above alluded 
mr buckles history of civilization in england the 
 statistics of the voluntary actions of mankind are 
adduced to prove a further conclusion which not merely 
subjects every moral agent to the law of causation but 
apparently exempts him from all personal responsibility 
rejecting the metaphysical dogma of free will as 
resting on the fallible testimony of consciousness mr 
buckle maintains that the actions of men vary in obe 
dience to the changes in the surrounding society and 
 that such variations are the result of large and general 
causes which working upon the aggregate of society 
must produce certain consequences without regard to 
the volition of those particular men of whom the society 
is composed and in applying this doctrine to particular 
cases he carries it out so consistently as to maintain 
 that suicide is merely the product of the general con 
dition of society and that the individual felon only 

e the above remarks were written before the publication of dr m c coshs 
recent work on the intuitions of the mind i do not find any substantial 
difference between the authors view as stated in this later work and that 
previously given in the method though there are some expressions 
which tend to confirm my suspicion that the difference between us is more 
verbal than real thus he asserts p that causation in the will is 
entirely different from causation in other action a statement m which 
i fully concur only doubting the propriety of calling the former by this 
name of causation at all if there is a causation though of a different 
kind in moral as well as in physical action the generic notion of cause 
should be the same in both the specific features alone being different 
as distinguishing this kind of cause from that but can any univocal 
generic notion be pointed out amounting to an adequate conception of 
causation as such if not the definition of causation as a common 
genus is not the same in both and we have not the subdivisions of a 
generic notion but only the different senses of an equivocal term

it is surprising that this acute writer should not have 
seen that in opposing the evidence of statistics to that of 
consciousness he is comparing together two witnesses 
who are not speaking of the same thing the fact to 
which consciousness bears witness is the freedom of our 
own personal actions the fact which the statistical 
evidence is adduced to prove is the recurrence within 
certain limits of greatest and least frequency of actions 
distributed over an entire community the former evi 
dence tells us nothing directly concerning the actions of 
societies the latter tells us nothing directly concerning 
the actions of individuals nay it is precisely because 
the individual actions are not reducible to any fixed law 
or capable of representation by any numerical calculation 
that the statistical averages acquire their value as sub 
stitutes no one dreams of applying statistical averages 
to calculate the period of the earths rotation by shewing 
that four and twenty hours is the exact medium of time

comparing one months or one years revolutions with 
anothers it is only where the individual movements are 
irregular that it is necessary to aim at a proximate 
regularity by calculating in masses • to what cause the 
individual irregularity is due whether to the complexity 
and minuteness of the physical conditions of the problem 
or to the presence of moral conditions and free agency — 
whether it indicates contingency in the facts themselves 
or only a defect in our means of calculating— this is a 
question which can only be answered by an acquaintance 
with the individual objects under examination and which 
gains no elucidation from the statistics of large classes 

note e p 

sir w hamilton in connection with his theory of the 
nature of the causal judgment maintains that the schemes 
of liberty and necessity are both equally inconceivable 
though for the fact of liberty we have immediately or 
mediately the testimony of consciousness a free voli 
tion he tells us is inconceivable because we cannot con 
ceive an absolute commencement a scheme of necessary 
determination is equally inconceivable because we cannot 
conceive an infinite noncommencement as equally 
unthinkable he says the two counter the two one 
sided schemes are thus theoretically balanced but 
practically our consciousness of the moral law which 
without a moral liberty in man would be a mendacious 
imperative gives a decisive preponderance to the doctrine 
of freedom over the doctrine of fate we are free in act 
if we are accountable for our actions

appendix 

this theory though differing somewhat in the mode of 
reasoning is in its conclusion similar to that previously 
arrived at by kant that philosopher in his third 
contradiction of transcendental ideas arranges in parallel 
columns the opposite arguments in behalf of liberty and 
necessity with the view of shewing that each is irre 
sistible in its attack upon the other kant too like sir 
w hamilton maintains that the fact of liberty is 
guaranteed by the testimony of the moral law whose 
categorical imperative thou shalt necessarily implies a 
corresponding thou canst kant however denies that the 
liberty as a fact can claim the direct testimony of con 
sciousness for consciousness in his philosophy is limited 
to the phenomena existing in space and time whereas 
the freedom guaranteed by the moral law is a purely 
transcendental idea subject to no conditions of time and 
incapable of being presented in experience and this 
conclusion so far as its negative result the denial of 
a consciousness of freedom is concerned cannot be 
avoided so long as we maintain along with the universal 
authority of the principle of causality the position that 
we are not directly conscious of self as a reality but only 
of its several modes and affections if my first conscious 
ness relative to volition is not that of myself as willing 
but only of will as a phenomenon — if in the judgment 
i will there is no consciousness of but only of will — 
to this phenomenon of volition i am compelled by the 
principle of causality to suppose an antecedent deter 
mining phenomenon and to that again another and so 
on ad infinitum

but this conclusion is no longer forced upon us if we 
admit the existence of an immediate consciousness not 
merely of the phenomena of mind but of the personal 
self as actively and passively related to them we thus 
obtain for the fact of liberty not merely the indirect 
testimony of consciousness through the medium of the 
moral law but the direct testimony by the presence of 
the fact itself i am conscious not merely of the phe 
nomenon of volition but of myself as producing it and as 
producing it by choice with a power to choose the 
opposite alternative in this case i am not compelled to 
go back to any prior cause whatever i need not suppose 
a prior intelligent cause for my only positive notion of 
such a cause is myself determining which does not imply 
myself determined i need not suppose a prior phenomenal 
cause for i am conscious of the influence of motives as 
inclining only not as necessitating the whole point at 
issue thus turns on the following question can the fact 
of consciousness expressed in the judgment i will be 
analysed into a relation of phenomena subject to the law 
of causality is the principle which we invariably apply 
to the sequence of one phenomenon on another also 
applicable to the relation of any phenomenon to the one 
given cause myself 

sir william hamilton lays much stress on the impos 
sibility of conceiving an absolute commencement if by 
this is meant that i cannot conceive myself standing at 
the beginning of all time out of all relation to any ante 
cedent series of phenomena it is undeniably true but 
is such a conception needed to render the scheme of 
liberty comprehensible is it not sufficient for me to 
know that none of the chronological antecedents stand to 
my volition in the particular relation of a determining 
cause and this is the case if it is neither given as an 



appendix 

active power coercing nor as a passive phenomenon in 
variably preceding to say that some antecedent or other 
must go before my will is only to say that i do not stand 
at the beginning of all time but does this imply some 
one antecedent which is invariably followed by volition 
or some active power necessitating in each particular 
case if on the presence of the antecedent or group of 
antecedents a my volition sometimes takes place one 
way and sometimes another it is not determined in the 
same manner as physical phenomena if there is not 
always present some conscious being exerting his power 
over my will it is not determined in the same manner as 
it determines its own volitions but excepting these two 
senses what is meant by determining cause f 

is there then extant any definition of will which does 
not imply another will preceding perhaps not but the 
fault lies only in the authors of the definitions to refute 
a given definition does not prove the nonexistence of 
the thing defined if liberty itself is a simple fact of con 
sciousness the error lies in the attempt to define it at all 
the definition will necessarily involve a circle and upon 
that circle and not on the fact the antagonist reasons 
but then if the definition and the fact of consciousness are 
at issue the former must give way not the latter now 
consciousness tells me not that my will mils but that 
j will is it necessary to the conceivability of this fact 
that i should be able to analyse it into two constituent 
elements — to place an abstract on one side and an abstract 
will on the other thus literally fulfilling the satirical 
direction for the turbulent puritans burial by laying john 
apart from lilburn and lilburn from john will any 
other state or act of mind bear a similar analysis can 
i in any case separate the state from the mind and the 
mind from the state or give any definition which does 



 appendix 

not virtually repeat itself bat is it correct on that 
account to call states which i experience every day in 
consciousness inconceivable 

if indeed the freedom of the will be supposed to 
mean an absolute indifference to and independence of 
motives such a liberty would be not only inconceivable 
as a fact but worthless as a principle of moral action 
but such is not the liberty to which consciousness bears 
witness nor is such a liberty required as the only 
alternative against fatalism the influence of motives 
on the will is not denied only it is maintained that 
influence is not necessary determination and that motives 
are not causes in any proper sense of the latter term 
thus interpreted believe the scheme of liberty is 
inconceivable only if the determinist argument is un 
answerable and its answer is what i have attempted in 
this and the preceding note if the attempt to establish 
a contradictory conclusion fails liberty though not 
definable is surely as conceivable as any other simple 
datum of consciousness 



note f p 

that our earliest notion of causality arises from the 
fact given in the determination of our own volitions is 
suggested by locke and established beyond all question 
by maine de biran but then arises the question by 
what process do we transcend our personal consciousness 
and acknowledge in relation to the changes of the sensible 
world the operation of causes other than ourselves 
this process is called by de biran and by royercollard 
a natural induction a term severely criticised by 
m cousin were the process really inductive he argues 
we must believe every cause in nature to be like our

selves voluntary conscious and free and even then 
the belief in question might perhaps be regarded as 
universally true within the limits of experience but 
could never rise to the character of a necessary truth 
for a more satisfactory explanation m cousin has 
recourse to the principle of causality which he regards 
as a necessary law of the reason by virtue of which it 
disengages in the fact of consciousness the necessary 
element of causal relation from the contingent element 
of my personal production of this or that particular 
movement this necessity which compels the reason 
to suppose a cause whenever the senses or the con 
sciousness present a phenomenon is the principle of 
causality 

it is obvious to ask what do we gain by the principle 
of causality thus supposed does it explain in any 
degree the nature of that power which we are supposed 
to attribute to inanimate objects does it explain 
how we divest our original notion of the attribute of 
personality and whdt is left when we have done so 
does it furnish the slightest hint or help for investigating 
the true character of efficient causes by no means 
the principle itself is a mere statement of the fact that 
we do invariably suppose a cause of physical changes and 
that we cannot but do so it offers no psychological 
explanation of the fact it merely gives it the name of a 
principle of reason it does not give us any positive 
notion of the cause in question this remains we know 
not what — a something different from our own causality 
and as such supposable perhaps but inconceivable it 
does not tell us how we can attain to a more positive 
knowledge not by the senses for these present to us 
only successive phenomena not by the internal con

seiousness for this informs us only of personal causation 
not by the reason for this only tells us in general terms 
that there is a cause but furnishes no means of observing 
and distinguishing its character and varieties the cause 
of physical changes still remains like the subject of 
physical attributes a negative idea aje ne sais quoi 

nor does m cousins theory any more than that of 
de biran explain how we get rid of the personal element 
with which all intuitive causality is involved it only 
says that we do so and that we must do so the term 
induction employed by de biran and royercollard is 
indeed objectionable whether it be taken in the aristo 
telian or in the baconian sense the former is objection 
able inasmuch as our personal acts are not supposed to 
constitute or even adequately to represent the whole body 
of causal relations the latter is objectionable for the 
same acts cannot be selected instances shewing diverse 
operations of a law but must from the nature of the case 
be all of one kind but this objection affects only the 
language and not the basis of the theory indeed the two 
philosophers in question have expressly stated that their 
natural induction must be carefully distinguished from 
that of physics n but in point of language the phrase 
principle of reason is equally objectionable partly as 
tending to check all further psychological investigation 
into a point by no means as yet satisfactorily explained 
and partly as opening the way to the thousand extrava 
gances of ontological speculation by concealing the purely 
negative character of the notion of physical power on 
m de birans theory says m cousin anthropomorphism 
becomes the universal and necessary law of thought it

might be replied that in all cases where the presentation 
is given by internal consciousness only anthropomorphism 
is in fact the condition and the limit of all positive 
thinking 

i conceive therefore that there is nothing in m 
cousins theory which dispenses with the obligation of 
a further psychological examination of the origin and 
character of the supposed principle of causality such as i 
have attempted in the text of the present work whether 
that explanation itself be right or wrong must be judged 
by others but whatever may be its fate in this respect 
i shall deem its purpose sufficiently answered if it serves 
to call the attention of philosophers to a point hitherto too 
much neglected in speculation the important distinction 
between positive and negative intuitions and thoughts 



note g p 

in the controversy concerning the existence of a moral 
sense the question at issue has suffered considerable mis 
representation from the want of an accurate distinction 
between intuitive or presentative consciousness whose 
object is an individual thing act or state of mind and 
reflective or representative consciousness whose immediate 
object is a general notion or principle stewart for 
example in his life of adam smith observes it was 
the opinion of dr cudworth and also of dr clarke that 
moral distinctions are perceived by that power of the 
mind which distinguishes truth from falsehood this 
system it was one great object of dr hutchesons philo 
sophy to refute and in opposition to it to shew that the 
words right and wrong express certain agreeable and dis 
agreeable qualities in actions which it is not the province 
of reason but of feeling to perceive and to that power of 



£ appendix 

perception which render us susceptible of pleasure or of 
pain from the view of virtue or of vice he gave the name 
of the moral sense the same philosopher in his 
philosophical essays endeavours to obviate humes de 
ductions from hutchesons theory by falling back in 
some degree upon the views of cudworth and clarke 
and referring the origin of our notions of right and wrong 
to reason instead of sense tastes and colours said 
hume and all other sensible qualities lie not in the 
bodies but merely in the senses the case is the same 
with beauty and deformity virtue and vice to this 
stewart replies the decisions of the understanding it 
must be owned with respect to moral truth differ from 
those which relate to a mathematical theorem or to the 
result of a chemical experiment inasmuch as they are 
always accompanied with some feeling or emotion of the 
heart but on an accurate analysis of this compounded 
sentiment it will be found that it is the intellectual 
judgment which is the groundwork of the feeling and 
not the feeling of the judgment 

in a lecture on moral relations by the late professor 
mills the different opinions concerning our perception of 
 morality are summed up as follows 

 some ascribe our apprehension of it with hutche 
son to a peculiar internal sense similar in its operations 
to the external senses and confound moral perception 
with taste this is strictly speaking the theory of a 
moral sense 

 others attribute moral perception not to any 
peculiar sense but yet to a peculiar faculty of the 
understanding distinct from its general powers and they 
appear to identify conscience with the moral faculty 

 many deny the existence of a peculiar moral 
faculty and maintain that moral principles are appre 



appendix 

headed by the same powers of the intellect which 
perceive other kinds of truth 

 the utilitarian theory implies that moral relations 
are ascertained and embraced by the operations of the 
discursive faculty only 

the whole controversy may be considerably cleared by 
distinguishing moral facts from moral principles facts 
of all kinds are presented to and perceived by different 
faculties of intuition similar in the manner of their 
operation to the perceptions of sense and hence with 
some allowance for metaphor we may speak of internal 
or external senses is it then asked whether we discern 
morality in individual acts by the same faculties by which 
we discern other qualities of individual objects presented 
to us but of these qualities some are visible some 
audible and so on is it meant that an act can literally 
be seen heard smelt felt or tasted to be virtuous or 
vicious if not the perception of the moral character of 
acts is a distinct presentation and as such to be referred 
to a distinct faculty though being as will appear an 
object of internal not of external perception it is not 
like the external senses connected with a distinct bodily 
organ

by the same powers of the intellect which perceive other 
kinds of truth is only applicable to the general concept 
or principle through which morality is repreeented as an 
object of thought truth and falsehood can be dis 
tinguished in representative knowledge only and all such 
knowledge is most conveniently classified by reference to 
the single faculty of the understanding the same power 
of thought may inquire into the ground of various pre 
sentations it may investigate for example why one 
object is white why another is harmonious why a third 
is sweet why a fourth is beautiful why a fifth is 
virtuous but in all such investigations the fact of a 
given object possessing a given quality must be pre 
supposed as the groundwork of the investigation the 
distinction between a true and a false theory of morals 
will be determined by the same test as that between 
truth and falsehood in any other inquiry — its agreement 
or not with the facts as given in intuition 

it thus appears that a power of discerning right and 
wrong in individual acts must be allowed as the present 
ative basis without which no system of moral philosophy 
is possible such a power thus limited it is impossible 
for the utilitarian to explain away by any theory of 
association or education education may corrupt and 
pervert our presented ideas but it cannot originate them 
it may teach me to regard an act as right which is really 
wrong or vice versa but it cannot create the original 
impression of either to deny with locke and paley 
the existence of a moral sense because one man holds to 
be wrong what another holds to be right is like denying 
the existence of a faculty of sight because a man with the 
jaundice sees all objects yellow the existence of the 
faculty is shewn by our approving or disapproving at all 
it cannot therefore be disproved by the fact of our some 



appendix 

times approving or disapproving wrongly the opposite 
error of hume in holding that virtue and vice exist in 
the sense only lies in a confusion of the subjective feeling 
of approbation with the objective quality which gives rise 
to it the same confusion has taken place with regard to 
the secondary qualities of body heat and colour as 
sensations exist only in a sentient being but that such 
sensations originate from nothing at all in the bodies them 
selves is an absurdity long ago exploded if indeed ever 
seriously maintained 

this presentation of right and wrong however is by 
no means accurately exhibited in the account commonly 
given of moral sense it is not correct to describe our 
perception of the moral character of actions in general 
as coordinate with or including the judgment of our 
own conduct in particular right and wrong are not 
directly presented to me in any other actions than my own 
tf i see a murder committed in a puppetshow i have all 
the same presented phenomena as if i see a murder com 
mitted by a man i do not feel the same moral disappro 
bation because i do not attribute to the puppet the 
same internal consciousness of obligation as to the man 
but this consciousness is not presented except in the case 
of my own acts and from these is transferred represent 
atively to other men whose mental constitution i believe 
to be in this respect similar to my own the intuitive 
faculty is properly limited to the approbation or disappro 
bation of my personal acts and to this personal conscious 
ness must thus be traced the original notions of right and 
wrong as of cause and of substance and of all internal 



 as is done by bishop sanderson in his pralechone de obugatione 
oonscientue as well as by shaftesbury hutoheson and most of the 
advocates of a moral sense and stall more by smith in his theory of 
sympathy

phenomena hence if the terms moral sense and con 
science be used according to the ordinary philosophical 
distinction it will be more correct to describe moral 
sense as an extension of conscience than conscience 
as a limitation of moral sense 



note h p 

the difference between the relations of the several 
forms of thought to psychology and to logic has not 
hitherto been accurately marked psychologically all 
that is communicated by not given to the act of thinking 
belongs to the form not to the matter of the product 
but these psychological forms do not come within the 
province of logic unless some further process of pure or 
formal thinking is affected by them in its psychological 
relation modality is clearly one of the forms of judgment 
the necessary judgment a must be b expresses the 
existence of a law of some kind or other by which the 
attributes are inseparably connected the contingent 
judgment whose full expression is v a may or may not 
be b denies the existence of any law of the kind while 
the pure judgment aw b states the fact of an existing 
connection without taking into account the question of 
law at all the psychological question is this is the 
presence or absence of a law connecting the terms of a 

 this is exactly the reverse of the theory of adam smith who main 
tains that our judgments concerning the morality of our own acts is 
entirely derived from that which we pass on others this theory he 
carries so far as to assert were it possible that a human creature could 
grow up to manhood in some solitary place without any communication 
with his own species he could no more think of his own character of the 
propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and conduct of the beauty 
or deformity of his own mind than of the beauty or deformity of his 
own face 



appendix 

judgment given to or by the act of judging is it part of 
the given phenomena or a manner in which the mind 
regards them in other words is modality an affection 
of the predicate or of the copula do i in thought 
decide on the actual connection of a with a given 
necessary b or on the necessary connection of a with a 
given b in the former case the modality belongs to 
the matter of the judgment in the latter to the form 

the true answer to this question is sufficiently plain 
if sensible experience is incompetent to furnish the 
notion of identity between two phenomena it is equally 
incompetent to furnish that of necessary or contingent 
identity these are additional products of the act of 
thought experience having only presented the pheno 
mena in a constant or variable juxtaposition nay further 
the hypothesis that modality is given in the predicate of 
a judgment not thought in the copula becomes in ulti 
mate analysis destructive of itself for if in thought 
we connect a with what is given as necessarily b this 
implies that b has previously been thought as necessarily 
connected with some subject or other a necessaryb 
has no intelligible sense except in relation to some 
previous judgment c must be b the identification 
of a with b then takes place through the medium of c 
and the supposition that modality can be given as an 
affection of the predicate implies that it has been pre 
viously thought as an affection of the copula this is 
sufficient to establish the psychological position of modality 
as a form of the judgment but thus admitted it is 
indispensable that it should be expressed in the copula 
and not as is frequently done left to be gathered from 
our knowledge of the matter a judgment of the form 
 a is b whatever notions may be expressed by the 
terms can never be thought as other than a pure or 



 appendix 

assertorial judgment an apodeictical or problematical 
judgment requires a different statement of the copular 
relation a must be b or a may be b 

on the other hand the criticism of sir w hamilton 
though accurately expressed in relation to one process of 
thought only may be so extended as to be decisive as 
regards the exclusion of modality from logic necessity 
contingency c he says are circumstances which do 
not affect the logical copula or the logical inference 
they do not relate to the connexion of the subject and 
predicate of the antecedent and consequent as terms in 
thought but as realities in existence they are meta 
physical not logical conditions the syllogistic inference 
is always necessary is modified by no extraformal 
condition is equally apodictic in contingent as in 
necessary matter 

as regards the syllogistic inference these remarks are 
strictly accurate and would be conclusive against any 
modality proposed as a form of reamndng were a 
distinction for example set up between syllogisms in 
which the conclusion necessarily follows from the pre 
mises and syllogisms in which it may be inferred with 
more or less probability the latter would rightly be 
condemned as extralogical the true syllogistic inference 
being always necessary as regards the copula in judg 
ments the criticism cannot be accepted as verbally 
accurate unless we distinguish the logical copula from 
the psychological that modality relates to realities in 
existence is not conclusive for quantity and quality 
in all synthetical judgments do the same in the same 
degree and yet are rightly classed as forms of thought 
but if we extend the distinction between formal and 
material thinking so as to embrace judgment and con 

 discussions p 



appendix 

ception as well as reasoning it is clear that the copula 
is always necessary in analytical or formal judging as 
the inference is always necessary in formal reasoning 
material judgments however cannot be entirely ex 
cluded from logic in so far as they furnish data for 
formal reasoning they are admissible however only 
in relation to this latter process and hence those forms 
of judgment only are rightly to be regarded as logical 
which affect the formal inference derivable from them 
this is the case with quantity and quality but not 
with modality the latter affects the conclusion of a 
syllogism not as a conclusion in its relation to the 
premises but only in itself as a proposition for this 
reason it is logically preferable to exclude modality as 
a form and to treat it as if it affected the predicate 
only of the judgment the logical copula thus becomes 
in every instance assertorial only and if this be carefully 
distinguished from the psychological copula the remarks 
of sir w hamilton may be regarded as applicable to 
the whole of logic and to every process of thought
