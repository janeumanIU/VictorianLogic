it is no reproach on former writers to declare 
that there is still much to be said by way of 
preface to a new essay on logic in the 
thickets and upland passes of any science there 
are always improvements or inventions to b 
made nor is it for the bold discoverer of the 
country to make them but some humbler per

that require more light people continue to 
imagine that a code of laws of thought is 
intended for an instrument to be openly carried 
and unblushingly used on all occasions as a 
protection from the specious currency of false 
arguments and that a thoroughpaced logician 
is one who not only talks orthodox syllogisms 
combined duly in analytic and synthetic method 
himself but also makes a point of bringing to 
the same pedantic accuracy the slipshod judg 
ments and crippled arguments which every day 
talkers are content to use if their view were 
correct we could not wonder at their treating 
such a public nuisance with some show of aver 
sion just as a publican hates an excisemans

which tries them as they arise the critical 
thoughts are continually present without the 
assent of the will one would think indeed 
were it not for the ohvious similarity these spon 
taneous visitors bear to the matter of former 
study that they were in no sense our own that 
an independent being one over whom we had 
absolutely no control was whispering within 
us in the poetical temperament the rising 
thoughts are less like anything we remember 
than in the workmg of common minds and 
hence poets have set up and maintained per 
haps in full sincerity a claim to the privilege of 
having an unseen spiritual prompter the source 
of their inspiration content to forego like 
baser men their independence for the sake of 
claiming high company in the madman a

of these two principles we maintain that the 
suggestive may be educated but only through 
long vigilance and training of the critical by 
no single act of the will can a man change his 
grovelling thoughts for high hid incorrect rea 
sonings for accurate but by a continued vigil 
ance in repressing and cutting off the thoughts 
we disrelish and approving those we affect the 
suggestions of our imagination will grow more 
in accordance with our judgment now logic 
is intended to educate the suggestive principle 
so that it generate none but just and exact 
thoughts by means of a constant supply of ex 
ercise for the critical not single acts of logical 
criticism has she in view but the formation of a 
logical habit through them which when she has 
accomplished her work is done wherefore 
though we impose strict rules and coin uncouth 
names for thoughts and arguments and enjoin 
a daily practice of minute and laborious exer

under this aspect the dulness of a treatise

outline of the laws of 
thought 

introduction 

like every other process the exercise of the 
understanding is conducted according to certain 
rules known or unknown we term the exer 
cise of the understanding thought the laws 
of thought are the laws hy which the under 
standing must act a complete code of he 
laws which regulate thought is termed the 
science of logic and the present introduction 
is devoted to the task of setting bounds to that 
science a labour by no means superfluous in a 
work of this kind since in their conception of 
the exact limits of logic no two independent 
writers that i can at present call to mind agree 
the intellect gains a knowledge of things 
by means of certain representations which they 
generate within it when subjected to observa 
tion such representations are of various kinds 

b 



 laws of thought 

differing in extent in clearness in value some 
are of individuals only and these are termed 
intuitions some are gained from intuitions by 
an internal process hereafter to be explained — 
these we call conceptions again some are 
conscious representations some not so a 
systematic division of representations in general 
is a necessary preliminary to our outline of 
logic 

they are divided then first into clear and 
obscure if one is conscious to ones self of the 
representation it is clear if not it is obscure 
consciousness being an imperative condition of 
every act of thought and logic being con 
versant only with acts of thought obscure re 
presentations as wanting this condition do not 
properly belong to the science nor indeed as 
this enters into every other to any science 
whatever to this class belong all sounds or 
sights which occur to a man in that state of 
reverie called absence of mind also many if 
not all images in dreams the conditions of 
reverie and dreaming being closely analogous 
besides these all representations which forming 
parts of a larger one are not consciously real 
ized owing to the minds preoccupation with 
the larger as a house or tree forming part of a 



introduction 

landscape we know that representation does 
take place without consciousness because when 
the attention is awakened to the representation 
we remember that prior to the awakening there 
was a certain affection pf the organ of sense 
which we are now enabled to identify as a re 
presentation a soldier in the heat of battle 
may receive a severe wound without immediately 
feeling pain his mind being completely preoc 
cupied and a man absorbed in thought will 
stare an acquaintance in the face without recog 
nizing him in short an impression is no 

more than the print which a seal can make on 
the finger of a waxdoll until by the mind it is 
made into sensation the fact established by 
these examples is that from some change in our 
state the same representation may become from 
an unnoted a noted from a fruitless a fruitful 
representation without any change in the object 
represented and the cause of the internal change 
is the awakening of consciousness conscious 
ness is the state of knowing that a representation 
is presented to the intellect or as it has been 
clearly enunciated by mr richardson the 
translator of kants logic it is a representa 
tion that another representation is within us 
all conscious representations are termed cog 



 laws of thought 

nitions clear representations or cognitions 
are subdivided into confused and distinct where 
all the marks of the representation are not 
distinguished it is conaised and distinct where 
we can distinguish and enumerate the marks 
for example the colour blue is a clear notion 
but we cannot tell by what marks we identify 
the colour and our cognition of it is confused 
house is a distinct notion when we can declare 
to ourselves its various marks namely that it is 
an enclosed and covered building fit for habita 
tion and it is to be remarked that this enu 
meration of notes or marks is in truth nothing 
else than a reference of the clear cognition to 
as many separate forms or genera as there are 
notes or marks to enumerate 

we subdivide the class of distinct cognitions 
twice according to two principles of division 
and first into adequate and inadequate cogni 
tions adequate cognitions are those in which 
besides enumerating the notes we can explain 
them that is can enumerate the marks of the 
marks of the distinct cognition and again the 
marks of those marks as this kind of analysis 
is almost interminable we call a cognition ade 
quate not when there can be no further enu 
meration of subordinate marks but when the 



introduction 

marks of marks are enumerated sufficiently for 
out present purpose in whatever subject we 
are employed our cognition of happiness for 
instance according to aristotle is adequate 
when we not only know that it is an energy of 
the soul according to the best virtue in a perfect 
life but can explain what is an energy of the 
soul what the best virtue and what a perfect 
life so we have an adequate notion of what 
hobbes means by right when we not only 
know that it is unresistible might in a state of 
nature but can explain unresistible might 
and state of nature the same two cogni 
tions are inadequate when we have the respec 
tive definitions but cannot explain them next 
distinct cognitions are divided into symbolical 
and intuitive an important division and more 
so in this treatise than in former ones because 
it enters into the doctrine of what are called 
identical judgments here more largely treated 
than elsewhere in a cognition we are able to 
substitute for an actual and present conscious 
ness of all its marks a symbol capable of re 
calling and serving as an equivalent to all the 
marks of the distinct cognition and such a 
substitute we term a symbolical cognition the 
intuitive cognition is one where a consciousness 



 laws of thought 

of all the marks is not only possible as in the 
symbolical but actual and simultaneous with 
the cognizing act simple mathematical notions 
may be of this kind and definitions in general

nate in using this table as an exercise write down 
the description of each division from memory with ex 
amples of it 

such are the materials out of which we con 
struct our thoughts but logic does not create 
the materials of thinking nor concern herself 
with their nature it is the process of thinking 
of which she expounds the laws thus to recur 
to instances already cited it is not the logician 
 but the moralist who first renders our confused 
notion of happiness a distinct one by declaring 
that it is an energy of the soul according to the 
best virtue in a perfect life and who after 
wards attempts to elevate our distinct notion 
into an adequate by means of an explanation 



introduction 

of each of its notes or marks as enumerated in 
the definition in doing all this he is a moralist 
bat in watching his own procedure whilst doing 
it in regulating every deduction and companson 
according to the necessary laws of thought in 
viewing each step of the process not merely by 
the light of a previous knowledge not merely by 
what he knows of the truth of his conclusicms 
but by rules independent of all reference to the 
object to determine whether they are conclu 
sions — real consequences evolved from what 
went before— or merely judgments jumbled into 
contact with prior ones — in doing this or in so 
far as he does it he is a logician we study 
logic separately but it is not a thing apart 
wherever there is a science there is ixc the 
science of morals is but the union of logic 
with a certain subjectmatter viz the happiness 
of man nay common conversation is but a 
similar union one cannot say his punch is too 
sweet or his horse a good one without uncon 
sciously putting in force a logical rule 

let us therefore examine more accurately 
what is the office of logic we define logic 
to be a science of the necessary laws of thinking 
or in more obscure phrase a science of theybrm 
of thought on the interpretation of this single 



 laws of thought 

syllable form depends our conceptio of the 
functions of the science it will be worth while 
therefore to explain it at some length but 
before dismissmg the division of cognitions and 
in connexion with the office of logic it may be 
here observed that if any one word can describe 
this office it is the word comparison thought 
is comparison of cognitions in two out of 
the three acts of thought this is plain enough 
judging is a mere expression of the relation of 
two cognitions when viewed with respect to each 
other and syllogizing as being conducted by 
judgments involves acts of comparison if less 
evident it is no less true in the third function of 
thought that of conception namely by con 
ception is meant the faculty of evolving from 
given cognitions other wider cognitions by 
means of the marks of those given thus by 
observing the marks possessed by every par 
ticular house we get the wider cognition house 
in general and here is plainly a comparison 
now viewing cognitions in this light we get a 
new division of them purely logical which the 
divisions already given are not — namely into 
comparanda and comparata into intuitions 
and conceptions intuitions are singular repre 
sentations or representahons of individuals 



introduction 

conceptions are universal representations re 
presentations of classes gained by comparing 
intuitions and cognizing the marks they have in 
common logic having to do with thought 
and thought being comparison intuitions are 
only considered in logic by virtue of their 
comparability of their serving as a ground for 
conceptions some notions however are both 
intuition and conception they are presented in 
speech by the name of the conception with the 
particle of singularity before it as a horsey a 
man 

and now what is the form of thought 
it is the fashion with certain modem logicians 
to insist on this phrase and yet i have met with 
no treatise on the science in which the doctrine 
of forms is clearly explicated whilst the case 
of a direct and demonstrable misapprehension 
of the philosophic use of the word form is not 
singular a learned writer in the edinburgh 
review no p who is right un 
sparing in his remarks on the oxford logic 
trips at this stumblingblock himself and in 
using the words formal laws — a tautologous 
expression ior form is law and lawformy as 
will presently appear — gives good reason of 
suspicion that he has been content with a phrase 

c 



 laws of thought 

without ascertaining its meaning even kant 
himself in his ixc is not clear on this point 
as when he defines p richardsons trans 
lation form as the way in which we know 
the ohject a definition borrowed from that of 
wolff p who tells us that rma is mo 
dus cognoscendi such a definition may be 
explained to mean pretty nearly any thing and 



 the writer in question can well afford to undergo 
a little further censure other sciences says he 
 propose for their object among the other faculties 
the operation of reasoning but this considered in its real 
nature logic on the contrary has the same for its 
object but only in its formal capacity in fact it has in 
propriety of speecht nothing to do with the process or opera 
tion but is conversant only with its laws now formal 
ia no way opposed to real but to material and it is 
absurd to say in the same breath that logic has no con 
cern with the process of reasoning and again that it is 
concerned to lay down the laws of that process in 
propriety of speech logic has nothing to do with a par 
licular act of thought but with the laws of the process 
in general again the intellectual operations were 
not in their own nature proposed to the logician — that 
belonged to the psychologist — but only in so far as they 
were dirigible or the subject of laws on the con 
trary it is precisely in their own nature for form as 
bacon says ipsissima res est that logic is concerned 
with these operations whilst psychology takes cogni 
zance of their manifeetationfl undier tarious subjectiye 



introduction 

in this instance kant makes it to include not 
what wolflf did but precisely that which in 
other terms wolff assigned to mattery its oppo 
site i it must however be observed that the 
 logic which bears kants name was not 
published with his sanction nor from his own 
ms 

let us first endeavour to frame a consistent 
explanation of the wordybrm and then to show 



conditions the word dirigible is nnfortanate for 
liogic is not primaruy employed in teaching io think but 
in showing how all must think again a first notion 
is the conception of a thing as it exists of itself and in 
dependently of any operation of thought ha john man 
animal c here two out of the three examples 
given are conceptions and as such presuppose an opera 
tion of thought namely conception if space would 
allow one might object to such expressions as generic 
categories one might tell the writer that in rejecting 
modality he begs the whole question by saying ne 
cessity possibility c are circumstances which do not 
affect the logical copula or the logical inference this 
unsupported assertion if it be simply an assertion or 
unwarranted argument if it be used as an argument is 
just what the kantian would unhesitatingly contradict 
see trendelenburg ezcerpta ez organo p and 
kants critick ed pickering p the modality 

of judgments only regards the talue of the copula 

the edinburgh reviewers errors spring all from one 
and the same source ignorance of the doctrine of forms 



 laws of thought 

on what foundation amidst a chaos of materials 
stored up in the writings of philosophers and 
those who ape them the explanation rests 
the word is used in three distinct but cognate 
senses itis a kw or an idea the latter 
bemg the former transferred to a thinking sub 
ject for that which contemplated objectively 
that is as existing externally to the mind 
we call a law the same contemplated subject 
ively that is as existing in a subject or mind 
is an idea hence plato often names ideas 
laws and lord bacon the british plato de 
scribes the laws of the material universe as 
ideas in nature quod in natura naturata 
jex in naturd naturante idea dicitur 
flame heated metal boiling water the rays 
of the sun all rank under one common form 
that is law of heat namely by which is 
meani that they all and each contain whatever 
is essential to heat lead gold vermilion 
stones and in a greater or less degree all 
sensible substances whatever possess gravita 
tion gravitation then is their form — the law 
under which they all come the condition with 
which they all comply by virtue of this form 



s t coleridge 



introduction 

they are — not bodies indeed — but gravitating • 
bodies in other words if that form or law 
were removed their existence as to that nature 
or property would terminate now how does 
every one of the given instances come under 
the forms heat and gravitation by some 
thing contained within itself — by its embodying 
the law or definition that which comes under 
the form of weighty must possess weight must 
have within it all that the definition of weight 
demands and hence we may trace the second 
meaning of the word form it is that part of 
any object through which it ranks under a 
given law every fresh representation for we 
are considering the question with reference to 
the thinking subject to which the mind is di 
rected is referred to different laws called forms 
by virtue of various qualities within itself each 
of which is termed metonymically and with 
respect to the law under which it is the means 
of ranking the representation its form for 
example let a man examine a stone and the 
intellect will forthwith and with the greatest 
rapidity proceed to class the representation of 
that stone afforded by the senses under the 
various forms of colour figure size weight 
temperature c and with reference to the 



 laws of thought 

• form say of weight the weight of ttie object 
would be its form sensu secundo with refer 
ence to the form sensu prime of colour the 
colour of the object would be its form so that 
that which in the object when viewed with re 
lation to one law or form is its form sensu 
secundo is not its form when the object is 
viewed in relation to another now the matter 
of any representation is that part of it which 
with reference to any given law is nonformal 
thus in our stone the weight size tempera 
ture are part of the matter as far as the law of 
colour is concerned for they all are nonformal 
and the colour of the stone alone is formal 
the matter is that which when added to the 
form sensu secimdo gives it extraneity — out 
ness — and makes it exist as a fact for without 
somewhat more than the mere form there can 
be no instance of a law an instance being the 
presence of the law in an object capable of con 
taining it and thus presupposing two things 
the law and the capable object whereof we 
term one the form sensu secundo and the 
other the matter for example triangle may 
be conceived by means of its ownrm or defi 
nition alone but it must have a material part 
it must become a triangle of lines or stone or 



introductioir 

wood as the sole condition of its external ex 
istence where no separation according to 
some law or other of a representation into its 
formal and material part takes place there must 
be total ignorance ofthe object represented 
the representation must remain obscure in 
which case it can never amount to a cognition 
the absolutely material part of a cognition will 
be that which remains unknown after it has 
been brought under as many forms as the ope 
rating intellect can reduce it to that which is 
nonformal throughout and never becomes the 
condition of the cognitions ranking under a law 
forms have a triple mode of existence they 
exist in the divine mind as ideas and are the 
archetypes of creation they exist as embodied 
in instances in which mode they are laws 
they exist lastly in the human mind as ideas 
thus they precede creation they are in it they 
succeed it 

there is yet a third sense of the wordrm 
as it denotes the law so by an easy transition 
it denotes the genus or class of instances 
brought together and cemented by the law 
thus to speak of the rm of animal may 
mean first the law or definition of animal in 
generali independent of all implication to in

by which it comes under the law and is what it

it will be needless to tell the student of rato 
that this doctrine is not new though he may 
look in vain in his favourite author for a con 
sistent exposition of it as applied to the subject 
of logic he will call to mind that the word 
idog is commonly and appropriately rendered 
by the latin ria which latter has been na 
turalized by philosophers in the word under 
discussion and that plato assigns to hoi all 
the three given senses as bacon to forma two 
at least of them for the use of those who are 
unaware of this a few illustrative quotations 
from different authors may be admitted in proof 
of what has been advanced the number of 
those from plato may easily be doubled or 
tripled by any one who will take pains to ex 
amine his works by the help of the indices of

with the citations from plato lord bacon says 
 the form of any nature is such that where it

nature presence and is in it all the same 
form is such that upon its removal the given 
nature infallibly vanishes therefore it is in 
variably absent where that nature is so it in 
those cases disavows that natures presence 
and is in it alone nov org ii the 
examination of forms proceeds thus concern

we speak of forms we understand nothing else 
than those laws and manifestations of the pure 
act which order and constitute any simple na 
ture as heat light weight in any sort of 
matter and subject that can contain them 
therefore the form of heat or form of light 
and the law of heat or light is the same thing 
nor do we ever abstract our thoughts from 
actualities and active manifestations nov 
org ii again for since the form of 
a thing is the very thing itself ipsissima resy

introduction 

that whicli is considered in relation to the uni 
verse or universal mind it follows clearly 
that no nature can be taken for the true form 
unless it ever decreases when the nature itself 
decreases and in like manner is always in 
creased when the nature is increased — nov 
or ii though kant is not so copious 
on the doctrine of forms it is clear that he had 
drank from the same sources as we since he 
uses as interchangeable the phrases form of 
thinking form of thought necessary laws 
of thinking necessary rules of thinking 
 laws of the understanding thus plainly 
evincing that after plato and bacon he re 
garded form in the sense of law this has 
not been overlooked by his interpreters every 
power writes dequincey exerts its agency 
under some laws — that is in the language of 
kant by certain foirms many casual re 
marks might be cited from writers old and 
modem in proof that they understood this doc 
trine with more or less distinctness for in 
stance clauberg says that things which are 
universal differ from universality itself as mat 
ter from form and le clerc defines ybrm to 
be that which constitutes a thing what it is per

 laws of thought 

this long chain of citations it will he seen that 
the sense assigned to form in the present work 
is at least amply warranted hy usage for the 
more important qualities of utility and selfcon 
sistency the reader must patiently question the 
whole hook and examine how far its teaching 
is fruitful and availahle in practice it remains 
to apply the doctrine oi forms to logic 

when it is asserted that logic concerns 
itself only with thoughts as to their form it is 
meant that the science neglects the distinctive 
parts of this thought and that regarding only 
the part which they have in common and hy 
which they come under the form or definition 
of thought as in forms in general the form 
of thought never occurs as a fact hut is only 
manifest when alloyed with something else 
which we call its matter that is there is never 
a thought hut it is a thought about something 
mathematical truths are thoughts ahout quan 
tity to logic their heing thoughts is the for 
mal their heing ahout quantity the material 
part the proposition that all radii of a circle 
are equal if examined as to our mode of con 
ceiving it will be found referable to two forms 
thought and quantity it is a thought — it is a

introduction 

with it only in the former character mathe 
matics only in the latter and therefore its 
respecting quantities is the material or extra 
fofmal part to logic but its being a thought 
is not in turn the material part to mathematics 
for we must remember that every science and 
therefore mathematics contains logic — is 
logic applied and that which is the form to 
logic is also part of the form to every other 
science since into every system of thinking 
logic enters 

but the province of logic is still farther re 
stricted not only are we bound to neglect the 
distinctions of cognitions as to the object as we 
have already seen but it is also incumbent 
upon us to examine the distinctions of various 
thinkers for if there be any process which one 
thinking subject admits as legitimate yet which 
another from conviction rejects such process 
cannot belong to the form of thought nor does 
the form accompany it otherwise it would be 
legitimate thought not merely to one subject 
but to all who were cognizant of it such a 
process if there be one cannot belong to uni 
versal thought it is but part of the individual 
constitution to determine thought we must 
know what the understanding is and we gain

for ourselves the form of the understanding by 
the same procedure as other forms that of com 
paring many examples and neglecting their dis 
tinctive part our cognitions to adopt a meta 
phor of bacons are as images glassed in vari 
ous mirrors of unequal faces which take a cer 
tain distortion from the surface that reflects 
them the comparison of many mirrors not de 
fective in the same parts and all more or less 
true suffices to certify us what the image would 
be thrown back from the surface of a faultless 
plane or we may compare the understanding 
to a lamp the representation is the object to 
be illumined the understanding itself is the 
light and the prejudices or peculiarities of the 
man stand for the coloured glass of the lantern 
surely he who would describe and explain the 
nature of the light would feel it incumbent on 
him to do so apart from the obstacles that inter 
cept and adulterate its rays one mind would 
jump to a conclusion of the guilt of an accused 
person from circumstantial evidence which a 
more impartial eye would at once pronounce de 
fective surely in this case the consequence or 
mode of concluding cannot belong to that form 
which universally accompanies thought and is 
its very self otherwise the second thinker would

not on examination have been able to reject it 
for every logical procedure carries cogency with 
in it the moment the terms conveying it afe 
clearly understood that a science regulating 
the processes and symptoms of thought which 
are not universal but limited to certain minds 
teaching how they should be treated so as to 
move in subordination to the higher modes 
would be most useful none will deny only ac 
cording to our view it is not logic let it be 
called by an old name metalogic or what its 
constructors will 

by some logicians second intentions are said 
to be the subjectmatter of logic the second 
intention of any representation is the mode in 
which it is regarded by logic and as we have 
shewn that logic only regards its formal part 
second intention is but another way of expressing 
formal part the first intention is the repre 
sentation as it naturally occurs to the mind 
prior to any attempt to refer it to the form of 
thought thus the straight lines a and b 
are equal caesar was ambitious man is 
bom to sorrow as to their first intention con

intention or mode in which the intellect knows 
them to he thoughts they are all one they are 
all judgments because in them all two repre 
sentations are conjoined in one consciousness 
second intentions are nothing else than cogni 
tions viewed as to the form of thought and di 
tested of their matter as the acts of the mind 
in thinking are three so are the classes of 
second intentions the first consists of concep 
tions with their various divisions and determi 
nations of genus species predicable c the 
second of judgments divided into affirmative 
and negative universal and particular substitu

in seeking the formal part of a given thought 
we are assisted by three viewpoints from each 
of which it must be examined and an examina 
tion conducted by which is exhaustive or 
rather the formal part is divisible by analysis 
into three ingredients and no more these are 
quantity quality and relation the last being 
found only in compound cognitions i e in

my reasons in the proper place a judgment is 
the most perfect act of thought for it contains 
all the three pdints of form and the more ex

they contain judgments not in virtue of their 
own nature besides these acts tajke place for 
the sake of obtaining a judgment and we call 
the end higher and more perfect than its hand

the three points of form the four in his system 
by the name of categories this title already 
introduced by aristotle to denote something 
wholly different is singularly infelicitous 
neither prior usage nor etymology affording the 
slightest sanction for its new sense arbitrary

change in the meanmg of received terms is 
one of the grand fountains of philosophical con 
fusion and controversy yet unlessoned hy time 
modem writers seem to surpass ancient in their 
addiction to it 

logic then is of cognitions as to the form 
not as to the matter of second intentions or 
notions not of first it remains to be shown 
how it treats these whether it looks to the ac 
quirement of a full knowledge of them and no 
burther — and this will constitute it a science 
or whether it meditates the application of that 
knowledge to an ulterior end adding something 
extraneous if necessary to facilitate that appli 
cation — in which case it will deserve the name of 
an art let us first attempt to obtain a more 
definite idea of science and art 

a science then is a code of principles and 
deductions on some objectmatter an art is a 
code of precepts with practical skill for the com 
pletion of some work art and science are each 
of them relative terms that is to say an art 
must be an art of doing something a sdence 



 such as has taken place in the words a priori ab 
strcxt and concrete chject and subject c consult tren 
delenburg ezcerpta ex organo on these words 



introduction 

must be a science of something in the one case 
the correlative being the result epyoy or thing 
to be effected and the correlative in the other 
being the objectmatter or thing to be known 
and the art will admit to its limits every thing 
that aids in the performance of the work for 
that performance is the sole principle of selec 
tion the science on the other hand having the 
objectmatter for its touchstone admits nothing 
save what relates directly to it now it may 
happen in some one case that an art and a science 
coincide precisely still they are not in idea the 
same and it would perhaps be a difficult matter 
to find the instance of their coincidence logic 
cannot be regarded as such an instance for a 
very slight acquaintance with the works of those 
who have treated it will satisfy us that where it 
has been constructed as an art with a view to 
the genesis and analysis of thoughts much has 
been necessarily admitted which could not con 
sistently be retained when it was to be con 
structed as a science however useful for its em 
ployment to that particular effect this fact 
must however be ascertained from those who 
we are sure have first realized to themselves a 
conception of the discipline whether art or 
science which they profess to teach there 



 laws of thought 

being many writers who neglecting tliis have 
united the definition of the science with the 
details of the art or committed mistakes equally 
glaring from possessing a merely historical 
knowledge of what they should have known 
philosophically aristotle may be cited as a 
constructor of the art kant of the science of 
logic wolff in his invaluable philosophia 
hationalisf though he calls it a science and 
treats it as an art proves by his very definition 
that what we think inseparable from an art he 
considers to belong to science so that on his 
own explanation of the technical terms he is 
quite consistent and adopts the aristotelian 
rather than anticipates the kantian view but 
the question which every future propounder of 
logic should ask himself is this — do i regard 
the objectmatter as the determining notion by 
which every thing is to be tried before i admit 
it within the logical pale — or do i more earnest 
for practical good and less tender of disfiguring 
the uniform structure by accessions from gram 
mar or from psychology neglect the object 
matter and look straight forward to the work 
which a knowledge of that objectmatter may be 
applied to achieve the answer will depend 
much on the taste of the selfinterrogator there 



introduction 

is no tribunal of appeal to bring the question to 
an issue making one view right and the other 
wrong the scientific view has however the 
advantages of clearness of completeness of 
brevity and putting each man in possession of 
the main knowledge required it will confer on 
every one the power of constructing an art out 
of the science which will be more useful than 
one externally acquired as formed with especial 
reference to his own necessities and failings 
and as more fully appropriated and dyed into 
the grain iykjptirfi£yov of his mind for no 
art of logic can be so complete as not to re 
quire considerable additions and modifications 
on the part of the student so that each in fact 
is in some sense the author of his own art 



 this view of art and science is not confidently 
offered for though it will be foand to ground itself on 
that of aristotle and not to be discrepant from common 
usage still it will not reconcile all the opinions on the 
matter as being contradictory any one disposed to 
 pursue the subject may consult among others aristotle

 laws of thought 

such are the notions that when hrought to 
gether make up the definition of logic which 
is a science of thought as to the form or in 
other words a science of the laws of thought 
it remains to add an explanation of certaiq 
other matters not integrant parts of this defini 
tion but still following from it first then 
logic has been called an a priori science 
what is the meaning of the words a priori 
an a priori cognition is usually explained to 
be one independent of experience and an a 
posteriori one which grounds on and proceeds 
from experience now a thing may be either 
independent of all experience whatever or of 
some particular experience of the latter use 
take the following example k a man cast a 
stone from his hand he knows a priori that 
it will come to the ground but he by no means 
has the knowledge independently of all expe 
rience since the law of gravitation which in

introduction 

eludes the fact in question has heen itself 
educed from a prior experience of his own so 
that in this case his a priori knowledge 
amounts to nothing more than the possession of 
a prior experience not of an innate idea and 
only implies independence of the particular fact 
tinder observation now when it is asserted 
that logic is an a priori science all that we 
affirm is that we can predict from our prior 
experience the cogency and accuracy of a de 
duction drawn in a logical way without any 
the least inquiry as to the nature of the par 
ticular example itself but without all expe 
rience and from our internal sources only we 
could not so determine in our former phrase 
our affirming the correctness of any appucation 
of logical rules is not independent of all but of 
this experience 

no doubt some reader has already antici 
pated a question which may be discussed here 
is logic solely concerned with thought and 
not with that medium through which we obtain 
an insight into the thoughts of others that 
which is the exponent of our own and without 
using which we not only cannot express our 
thoughts but actually do not think — i mean 
with language according to many logicians 



 laws of thought 

language and not thought is the adequate 
object matter of logic which they describe aa 
 an art of properly using words in argument 
whilst others expressly insist that thought or 
internal discourse sermo intemus not speech 
or external discourse sermo extemus is the 
object of logical inquiry these conflicting 
assertions suggest a difficulty which may be put 
in the following form if thought not speech 
is to be examined by logic it would seem that 
thinking and language are independent of each 
other and may be separately treated yet we 
know from daily experience — that not only are 
the connectives of our cognitions as they pass 
through the mind mere words which though 
unspoken the mind as it were whispers to 
itself but even many of our cognitions them 
selves are but symbolical and their symbols 
nothing else than the substantives which in 
uttered speech we assign them as names thus 
the cognition happiness occurs frequently to 
the moralist and doubtless when it occurs he 
understands by it whatsoever marks are in its 
definition at the same time he does not with 
every fresh recurrence realize those marks to 
himself but substitutes the symbol for the de 
finition as a natural abbreviation of the think 



introduction 

ing process we answer that it may be true 
that mternal discourse is conducted by means 
of the same symbols as would be used in 
making it external namely grammatical phrases 
and yet not true that there is a necessity fox 
the employment of these signs and no others 
the avoidance of a double process of ratiocina 
tion for every train of thought which having 
ourselves gone through we might wish to im 
part to others an immediate consequence of 
having two kinds of symbols one for thought 
another for speech would of itself be a suffix 
cient reason for thinking by words but a rea 
son grounded in expedience only not in any 
necessary connexion between speech and rea 
soning if my reader should be unable to 
imagine the possibility of any symbols of thought 
except spoken words let him reflect for a mo 
ment on the means which we possess for con 
versing at a distance when our spoken lan 
guage is useless in our naval signals and the 
telegraph the use of the latter instrument 
was termed by its inventor dr hooke a me 
thod of discoursing at a distance not by sound 
but by sight and why should it be impos 
sible to discourse to ourselves not by sound 
but by sight for example can we not con 

f

ceive the possibility of course i mean only the 
possibility of our using as a symbol for the 
united marks which make up our conception of 
happiness some such remembered image as 
 red flag over blue or the like and of our 
growing at last so expert that to see red flag 
over blue would immediately remind us of 
those marks this will excite a smile but 
had we been bom deaf and dumb and placed in 
circumstances to exercise our reflective powers 
we should beyond all doubt have been forced 
on some analogous invention and if i am 
reminded that telegraphic signs are not so pro 
perly signs as they are signs of signs i answer 
that the intervention of words between a com 
bination of flags and the cognition they denote 
is plainly a mere expedient founded on the 
universal acceptation of spoken language any 
fair account of the successful attempts to hold 
communication with the deaf and dumb — a sub 
ject deeply interesting — will substantiate all 
that is here advanced 

now though thought employs spoken words 
yet it having been shown that after the remo 
val of spoken words thought could still pro 
ceed it follows from what we have said of 
forms that the phenomena of speech can be 



introduction 

no part of iheform of thought and there 
fore belong not to logic the intellect must 
employ signs but not these signs i be 
lieve coleridge is reported to have said that 
processes of thought might be carried on inde 
pendent and apart from spoken or written lan 
guage i do not in the least doubt that if ian 
guage had been denied or withheld from man 
or that he had not discovered and improved 
that mode of intercommunication thought as 
thought would have been a process more sim 
ple more easy and more perfect than at pre 
sent and would both have included and evolved 
other and better means for its own manifesta 
tions than any that exist now and we are 
not bound to consider in this treatise such 
matters as equivocation of terms or the predi 
cate standing first in a sentence for the plain 
reason that these are to be provided for in 
grammar grammar must supply logic with 
symbols ready corrected an equivocal symbol 
is not a symbol in any available sense because 
the first condition we exact from a sign is that 
it serve to recall the thing it represents with 
which it cannot be said to comply if it stand 
for half a dozen different things thus if 
gallus stands both for i cock and a french 



 laws of thought 

man as some logicians quaintly assure us 
grammar must devise means by a capital g or 
otherwise to obviate the confusion because 
grammarians have neglected to treat of inter 
pretation or the art of connecting thought and 
speech so that the latter adequately represents 
the former the logician is not therefore bound 
to receive it into logic he may indeed re 
cite its rules as prefatory or supplementary to 
his science at his pleasure still less is he 
warranted in presenting the student with a list 
of the words commonly used ambiguously taken 
from the whole encyclopaedia of sciences as 
part of a logical system such a course smacks 
of the plan of the sophists of greece that of 
furnishing certain clever commonplaces or to 
pics excerptions from all sorts of disciplines 
with a view to the equipment of a knowing dis 
putant to teach the eristic or disputatory 
art is another matter than to lay down the 
rules of loc 

a few more general remarks will exhaust 
our introductory matter though our science 
of the laws of the understanding leaves out of 
view the content of every cognition and only 
regards what kind of cognition it is as concep 
tion judgment or syllogbm still the know 



introduction 

ledge of the content is indispensable in many 
applications of the necessary rules to a parti 
cular case this arises from an imperfection 
in the symbols we use in thinking which often 
furnish us with no means of determindig 
whether the whole or a part of some concep 
tion is brought into question men are ready 
to forgive injuries — men are mortal — both ap 
pear as judgments but if we would knowhow 
they differ from each other we must bring in 
our knowledge of the matter to aid us when it 
will appear that the former speaks of some men 
only the latter of men in general this use of 
our knowledge of the matter of judgments is 
no part of logic yet it is frequently called in as 
subsidiary to its application and only for this 
subsidiary purpose which no writer who views 
logic as an art could overlook has it been 
introduced into the body of certain treatises 

 common logic says carlyle from no 
valis is the grammar of the higher speech 

that is of thought logic occupies itself 

with the mere dead body of the science of 
thinking i may add — logic displays the 
skeleton of thought which does not acquire in 
dividuality until clothed with the muscles and 
scarfed with the skin of sciences less dry it 



 laws op thought 

is the painters layfigure which is now rohed 
for a brutus now for a bacchanal yet is at 
bottom the same figure still it is the bare 
trunk and branches of thinking on which other 
sciences are as the fruit and leaves furnishing 
the means of distinguishing tree from tree 
it is the rhythm of the tune the mould of the 
potter on which a thousand vases are moulded 
yet itself is none as other sciences take sim 
ple facts and classify them and enunciate the 
rules whereby they are governed so logic clas 
sifies these very rules abstracting from all 
sciences and laying down the laws that regulate 
them the givers of laws wherefore logic is 
the most abstract of all the sciences

intuitions are singular cognitions that is 
they represent single objects or individuals 
this last word is of logical origin and is ap

conceptions they cannot be divided without 
ceasing to be what they are — cum dimduntur

§ — conceptions 

a conception is defined to be a single cogni 
tion of the common marks of many objects it 
is formed by abstraction or the process by 
which when contemplating a plurality of objects 
we neglect their points of difference and observe 
only the notes they have in common from 
which we form a new representation 

soholion the term abstraction has been 
variously explained because different authors 
have assigned it to different parts of one 
and the same process with kant the final 
 act of the process commonly named general 
ization usurps the name here given to the 
whole whilst with others abstraction becomes 
almost the same as the reflection of kant but 
the difference is fortunately a verbal one for 
what the process is all are agreed though they 
enumerate its acts differently in the present 
essay abstraction applies to the whole process 
from first to last of forming conceptions and 
includes the various acts of comparison which 
views various representations together of re 
flection which seeks marks whereby these repre 
sentations may be combined in a single new 
one and of generalization which finally forms 
this new inclusive representation 



conceptions 

§ — difficulties suggested by the 
foregoing division 

some difficulties arise from this division of cog 
nitions as i how are imagined representations 
classed the notion we have of a landscape from 
some poetical description for example as 
being formed by marks they seem to be con 
ceptions but on the other hand as being of 
individuals and as borrowing somethmg of aid 
from the remembrance of similar objects to 
 envisage them they partake of the nature of 
intuitions omitting a nice question as to the 
difference of power in the imaginative faculty 
which in some cases calls up with a fidelity and 
determinateness almost equal to that of a pic 
ture in others cannot go beyond a vague con 
ception of principal features we may lay down 
in general that the representations under dis 
cussion are conceptions used partially § 
thus having a general notion of landscape we 
set apart or exclude some of the instances con 
tained under it by aid of the marks of time 
place feature supplied by the description and 
the more marks enumerated the fuller the de 
termination § and the nearer our concep 
tion will be to an intuition 

ii what are those cognitions to which though 



 laws of thought 

sensible images we give the name of the con 
ception as a house a king this difficulty has 
been solved already in the introduction they 
are both intuition and conception 

iii can there be abstraction without gene 
ralization as whately maintains suppose 
we are speaking of the present king of france 
says he he must actually be either at paiis 
or elsewhere sitting standing or in some other 
posture and in such and such a dress c yet 
many of these circumstances which are sepor 
rahle accidents and consequently which are 
regarded as nonessential to the individual are 
quite disregarded by us and we abstract from 
them what we consider as essential thus form 
ing an abstract notion of the individual yet 
there is here no generalization to which it 
may be answered first that strictly speaking no 
determination of time place or the like but is 
essential to the notion of the individual at any 
given period however nonessential to the in 
dividual looked at as part of a conception and 
next that the very power to distinguish what 
is essential from what is not proceeds from a 
prior act of generalization by which we get in 
the given instance the conception jcing with 
all that is essential thereto and that our notion 



conceptions 

of the inditidual is gained by adding to the con 
ception such marks of time place c as suffice 
to determine it there can be no abstraction 
without generalization somewhere in fact 
though we in name distinguish abstraction from 
generalization they are but parts of the same 
act 

§ — higher and lower conceptions 

abstraction has place not merely in com 
paring many intuitions to form a conception 
but also in comparing many conceptions to form 
a higher one the conceptions thus generated 
from lower conceptions may again be subjected 
to the same course and the new ones produced 
may again receive the same treatment but as 
we discard according to the very definition of 
abstraction certain marks from our conceptions 
and retain only certain others whenever we 
arrive at a conception the marks of which are 
 few that to cast away any would render it 
unintelligible and incapable of being represented 
then our liberty of abstracting ceases we have 
arrived at the highest conception — or summum 
genusf and further ascent is impossible 



 laws of thought 

§ — extension and intension of con 

ceptions 

the higher our conception is the more ohjects 
it contains under it as animal is a higher con 
ception than mammalia and contains more oh 
jects this capacity of a conception is called 
its extension but in proportion as this exten 
sion increases the numher of marks decreases 
and consequently the distinctness of the repre 
sentation to the mind which distinctness is 
termed the intension so the intension decreases 
as the extension increases and vice versd some 
call the intension what the conception contains 
in ity i e its marks and the extension what it 
contains under it i e the ohjects from which 
it was generated 

§ — determination 

the reverse of the abstractive process that of 
descending from higher conceptions to lower 
by resuming the marks laid aside is called de 
termination as abstraction augments the ex 
tension by diminishing the marks so determi 
nation augments the intension by increasing 
them in a conception which we term also a 
genus the lower conceptions are only partially 



conceptions 

marked out having no marks but those of the 
higher they are undetermined for their own 
marks determine to add marks to those 
aheady belonging to the superior conception 
taking care that those be not repugnant from 
these is to determine the species from the 
genus the lower from the higher conception 
intuitions or representations of individuals and 
they only are said to be fiilly determined be 
cause with them determination ceases there 
are no more marks to add the inclusion of 
conceptions one within another is called the 
subordination of them 

§ — genus and species 

genus and species are relative terms and a 
superior conception is relatively to its inferior 
named genus an inferior relatively to its supe 
rior species j kant the same conception 
is with respect to one ranking under it a genus 
with respect to the one above it a species in 
fima species is the species which cannot be a 
genus that is under which there is no lower 
conception to which it may stand in the relation 
of a genus it may be doubted whether we can 
ever declare the infima species since we cannot 
be sure that some marks out of which we might 



 laws of thought 

have determined a lower representation have not 
escaped us infima species is also defined qtue 
non nisi individua sub se continet 

§ — proximate and remote genus 

when we regard a species not in relation to 
the conception immediately ahove it but to one 
still higher we are said to pass by its proxtmate 
and refer it to its remotcf genus thus a being 
a conception included in and b in c b is the 
proximate genus of a and c the remote 

§ — privative conceptions 

we have hitherto spoken of conceptions as 
formed from positive marks but there is a class 
of them arising from a privation or absence of 
certain marks hence conceptions are divided 
into positive and privative the latter admits 
of subdivision but as this requires a knowledge 
of the matter of conceptions it has no place in 
a formal science the only kind of privatives 
which we recognize here are those expressed by 
the negative particle prefixed to a positive as 
from b the positive we gain the notion of not 
b the privative whose only mark is that it lacks 
the marks of b nothing included in the exten 
sion or sphere of b can be included in notb 



conceptions 



• 



hence they are said to he repugnant or opposed 
and no third conception from the same marks 
is possihle 

§ — the opposition of positives and 

privatives 

the opposition hetween a positive and its priva 
tive has been termed contradictory which term 
may produce confusion for there is no contra 
diction properly so called except between two 
judgments and the opposition found in these 
conceptions differs fundamentally from the con 
tradictory opposition of judgments explained 
hereafter for here the formation of a positive 
necessitates the cognate privative there cannot 
be a b but there is a notb but the formation 
of a judgment expels its contradictory and 
thus what is termed by logicians the contradic 
tory opposition of conceptions differs from the 
contradictory opposition of judgments in that 
contradictory conceptions must be tenable to 
gether contradictory judgments cannot 

§ — form of conceptions 

the form of conceptions is nothing more than 
the answer to the question — what do we know 
a priori is essential to all conceptions they 

h 



 laws of thought 

must be of a certain quantity universal namely 
singular representations being termed intuitions 
and of a certain quality that is either positive 
or privative to regard a given conception 
both as to form and matter is to consider it in 
its first intention to view it as to form alone 
i e to thihk of it only as a conception without 
regard to what it is a conception of is to con 
sider its second intention 

§ — resolution and partition 

to separate from each other the essential marks 
of a conception is called the resolution of it 
the separation of the parts of an intuition by 
which it ceases to be a whole is termed for dis 
tinctions sake partition this name is the 
more appropriate that the parts so attained can 
not be regarded as wholes in resolution of con 
ceptions on the contrary each of the marks 
becomes in one sense a larger whole than that 
into which it entered as part for example the 
resolution of the conception triangle mio jigure 
and ojthreesidesy its marks generates two 
wholes each of greater extension than the con 
ception produced by their confluence both 
these processes are sometimes improperly called 
division improperly because the avoidance of 
confusion should be our first care in a science 



conceptions 

and the name division has long been appropri 
ated by logicians to a strictly logical process 
which divides the extension not the intensionf 
of conceptions 

§ di verse genera 

after the resolution of a conception it may be 
included in one higher one by this mark and in 
another by that hence it appears that a lower 
conception may stand in the relation of species 
to different genera according as abstraction 
fixes on one set of marks or another 

§ — use of conceptions distri 
bution 

though all conceptions are universal they may 
still have a particular use in other words we 
can think of part only of a conception instead of 
the whole when the convenience of thought 
enjoins where we represent judge of or 
reason from a whole conception it is said in 
technical language to be distributed where a 
part only is treated we call it undistributed 

§ — abstract and concrete 
representations 

abstract and concrete are relative terms 
when a higher conception is seen to exist in a 



 laws of thought 

lower or in an intuition as we see the marks of 
animal in the conception horse or a horse we 
are said to see the abstract in the concrete so 
of two cognate conceptions the more abstract 
bears the name of the abstract the more deter 
mined § we call the concrete 

scholion these words abstract and con 
crete have already been noticed as having un 
dergone great changes of meaning and the 
explanation above is not the only one attached 
to them 

§ — division of conceptions 

the enumeration of the various species by ab 
stracting from which any genus is formed is 
called a division of such genus division re 
spects only the extension of conceptions § 
its rules are — the species enumerated called the 
membra dividentia must exclude one another 
that is no part of one is to be contained in any 
other they must be equal when taken toge 
ther to the divisum or conception divided 
the former rule depends on the use of one 
 principle of division and one only in each 
division thus men are divided as to charac 
ter the principle into righteous and unright 
teous but not into righteous and africans 
as that uses two principles

—judo me 

a declaration of the relation 
between two corapured representations this 
relation is either a of inclusion or exclusion 
or of substitution every judgment has three 
parts the subject or representation ahout which 
the judgment is the predicate or representa 
tion with which the subject is compared and 
the copula or nexus which expresses the mode 
n between them 



§ — two classes op judgments 
judgments of inclwiion called also attrihu 
live are those therein the subject differs from 
the predicate both as to form and matter and 
where it is declared how far tlie subject comes 
within the sphere or extension of the predicate 
judgements of aubatittition are those whose sub 
ject differs from the predicate as to the form 



t 



 laws of thought 

i e differs iom it not in having marks which 
is the form of a conception but in the particular 
marks which it has but does not differ as to 
the matter so that the subject and predicate 
are precisely equal being different representa 
tions of the same objects for example if the 
magnet be the only thing which attracts iron 
and also the only thing which points to the 
north both these properties are essential marks 
of the conception magnet now if one judge — 
 that which attracts iron or the magnet al 
ways points to the north the judgment is suhsti 
tutivey for the predicate differs from the subject 
in its marks but not in its objects or sphere 

§ — two predicables corresponding 
to the classes 

the distinction between these two classes de 
pends therefore on the extension of the predi 
cate as compared with that of the subject in 
ottributiye judgments the predicate may be 
greater or less than the subject in substitutive 
judgments the predicate is precisely equal to the 
subject so that one could be changed for the 
other from this difference of comparative ex 
tension two predicables or classes of predicates 
have been formed namely attribute and deji 



judgments 

nition the former including such predicates as 
are assigned to subjects differing from them in 
form and matter the latter those which are 
to their subjects but new forms of the same 
matter 

scholion it might appear that the name 
attribute should belong to both predicables 
but as a definition is in some sort the same as 
the conception of the thing it defines it cannot 
properly be an attribute of it since a thing can 
not be attributed to itself the name is there 
fore restricted to that class of predicates where 
something wholly new — new as to form and 
matter — is assigned to the subject 

scholion aristotle makes four predicables 
or classes of predicates two which can change 
places with their subjects the form ofthejudg 
ment remaining unaltered according to the 
rules of conversion hereafter explained these 
he calls definition and property — two which 
cannot these are genus and accident the two 
former have this licence as being exactly equal 
to the subject whilst the two latter as wanting 
this relation of equality cannot undergo the 
transposition without a certain restriction on the 
quantity of the judgment 

now the two predicables preserved in the 

i 



 laws of thought 

present system include as much as aristotles 
fopr that of definition including the convertible 
predicates property and definition that of at 
tribute comprehending the inconvertible genus 
and accident to distinguish between property 
and definition or between genus and accident 
is metaphysical not logical it may however 
be shown how property comes under the head 
of definition a definition as to its application 
is such a conception as will enable us to recog 
nize the definitum — with which as to matter it 
is identified — under any circumstances now 
as the predicating property of a thing is the 
assigning to it something which belongs to it 
alone and to it all at all times and as such a 
mark must in fact be an inseparable part of 
itself and therefore always sufiicing for its re 
cognition it is nothing else than what we have 
explained definition to be as for accident a 
conception representing it is nothing else than a 
genus in relation to its subject that a given 
predicate in accident is not at all times the genus 
in relation to a given subject is a point that 
does not affect the judgment so long as we do 
not argue from what is temporary to what is 
constant and immutable compare arist top 
i viii pacian ed 



judgments 

scholion we have said that a suhstitu 
tive predicate dififers from its subject in form 
and not in matter they do not differ in 
matter so they must in form otherwise they 
are the same which last is plainly not the 
case since the addition of one to the other adds 
something quite new to our cognition the 
difficulty is how being both conceptions and 
so far agreeing in form sensu primo p 
do they yet differ in form they differ ir 
form sensu secundo p that is though 
they agree in having marks they have diffh 
rent marks they differ in form in the sense 
of formal part — that which makes them what 
they are 

§ — of definition 

what is distinctive of the present work turns 
so much on this doctrine of predicables that it 
will be proper to examine the nature of them at 
more length and first of definition the term 
definition is a relative one and its correlative is 
the definitum or thing defined a definition is 
a complete conception of the objects represented 
by the definitum complete that is in requiring 
no farther determinants § no doubt the 
psychological qrigiii qf definition is the neces 



 laws of thought 

sity of jepresenting an object in a manner 
either universally or to us more understood 
this point however does not concern us we 
only require of a representation that it have 
the same matter with and a different form 
ftom another representation to constitute the 
one a definition and the other a definitum 
and this being the sole requirement it follows 
that a definition as fulfilling the condition 
may be regarded in turn as a definitum ac 
cording to the place it holds in the judgment 
for the subject is always the definitum and 
the predicate the definition 

§ — of the sources of definition 

definition may arise in five ways i by 
resolution § in which the definitum is 
resolved into its marks in the definition ii 
by composition the exact reverse of the last 
in which the definitum a conception enume 
rating its component marks stands subject to 
a definition implicitly containing those marks 
iii by division § wherein the definitum 
is defined by enumeration of its dividing mem 
bers iv by colligation the exact reverse of 
the last where the definitum enumerates the 
dividing members and the definition unites 



judgments 

them y by casual substitution where one 
representation is substituted for another on 
none of the four preceding principles but on 
that of accidental expedience 

to the first are to be ascribed those expla 
natory propositions to which the name defi 
nition is commonly appropriated the second 
includes the converses § of these in the 
third all disjunctive judgments rank they are 
judgments where the predicate is but the sub 
ject logically divided and the fourth class con 
sists of inductive judgments the fifth com 
prehends all those judgments not referable to 
any of the former classes yet possessing the 
property of a subject and predicate identical as 
to matter 

scholion this mention of matter will startle 
the logicians who follow an edinburgh reviewer 
quoted above p it is nevertheless true 
that the yery jbrm of these judgments depends 
on a certain relation as to matter between the 
parts of them we must add a caution that it 
is not logic that explores and takes cognizance 
of the matter of any conception but some other 
science according to what the conception is 



 laws of thought 

§ — kinds of definition as to 
quantity and quality 

defining judgments are as to qualityf invar 
riably affirmative the very function of a nega 
tive being to render indefinite they are com 
monly held to be universal also that is to dis 
tribute § the subject but this is not ne 
cessary to a definition part of a subject may 
be defined as well as the whole though of 
course the practical use of defining a portion 
and that not distinguished otherwise of a con 
ception is very limited the formal part of all 
judgments lies in the nexus or copula no 
two judgments dififering either in quantity 
quality or relation have the same nexus really 
though the grammatical is may stand alike 
in both but the more we express in our 
nexus the less confusion we shall be obnoxious 
to and for this reason we adopt for the copula 
of substitutive judgments the mathematical sign 
of equality with this restriction that it does 
not signify so much a mere equality as an ob 
jective identity 

scholion as in defining we assert some 
thing is equal to something it is plain that a 
definition of an undistributed term must be 



judgments 

false if the definition hold true of the same 
subject distributed § for example some 
triangles figures having three sides and three 
angles is absolutely false because all tri 
angles figures having three sides and three 
angles is true for the part cannot be equal 
to that to which the whole is equal this is 
to be noticed because in judgments where at 
tribute is the predicate the truth of the uni 
versal necessitates not precludes the truth of 
the particular 

§ — of the predicable attribute 

attribute is predicated of a conception 
wherever the predicate difipers both in form and 
matter from the subject not only must it 
possess dififerent marks but must include dif 
ferent objects it must be a new conception 
both as to intension and extension if the 
predicate include the same objects as the sub 
ject it must contain more or fewer otherwise 
it is a definition an attributive judgment is 
of less extensive use in deduction than a sub 
stitutive it is sometimes necessary in dis 
covery to treat that which objectively to others 
more fully informed is a defining judgment as 
subjectively a merely attributive one from our 



 laws of thought 

inability to determine the sphere of the predi 
cate relatively to the subject for it is com 
petent to us to treat any defining judgment as 
an attributive one but not vice versd 

§ — of the form of judgments 

we must now inquire what the form of judg 
ments is this we have already declared to 
be that which constitutes them what they 
are in other words that by which they are 
judgments at all it may be best found by 
reference of it to three distinct heads namely 
quantity quality and relation to these 
kant adds a fourth namely modality the 
reasons for renouncing which shall be presently 
stated the result of them being that the 
modality of judgments is not a part of their 
form 

§ — as to quantity 

as to quantity judgments are either uni 
versal particular or singular according as the 
subject about which the judgment is is a 
whole conception or part of a conception or 
only an intuition a particular judgment is 
one which declares something of a part only 
of its subject i e which judges of a subject 



judgments 

undistributed universal and singular judg 
ments declare something of the whole of theirs 
i e they judge of a suhject distributed 
though differing as to the extent of their sub 
ject as a cognition these two last are classed 
together as possessing the common property 
of distributing the subject 

schqlion the reason assigned for classing 
singulars with universals is this the form of 
judgments does not regard the absolute extent 
of the two terms but their nexus or the way 
in which they are conjoined it would be 
desirable indeed that the sign of universality 
or particularity should in all cases be attached 
to the copula instead of being prefixed to the 
subject now in universals the nexus of the 
two terms is without exception as by all a 
is b we mean that a is always b in par 
ticulars it is contingent and mutable as by 
 some c is d we mean c is sometimes hut 
not always d now there can be no other 
nexus as to the extent to which one belongs 
to the other than these two — always and not 
always it becomes a question then — which 
nexus has place in singular judgments the 
former for let it be the latter then some of 
the subject belongs to the predicate some does 

k 



 laws of thought 

not therefore the subject is divisible but it 
is an intuition therefore an individual there 
fore indivisible therefore a thing which is 
divisible is indivisible which is absurd those 
who wish for a lengthy and erudite thesis on 
this matter may consult walliss logic the 
sis i 

§ — as to quality 

judgments as to quality are either affirma 
tive or negative the former are such as have 
an affirmative nexusy which is either of inclu 
sion or identity i e of attribution or of defi 
nition the latter those containing a negative 
one which expresses exclusion 

lemma a sign of negation — the par 
ticle not — may enter into a judgment and 
yet the judgment be affirmative to know 
the true negatives we must see whether the 
copula contains a negation privative con 
ceptions § have a negative sign and yet 
the judgments into which they enter are not 
of necessity negative 

as the including a subject in a predicate 
which is a positive conception necessitates the 
exclusion of it from the cognate privative § 
and as the judgments expressing the two acts 



judgments 

are equivalent we may when we prefer a 
negative to an affirmative formula in analysis 
change the one for the other which is done 
where a privative — notb — is affirmed of a 
suhject hy denying the cognate positive of 
the same suhject thus a is notb be 
comes no a is b 

§ — as to relation 

judgments are of two kinds as to relation 
i e as to the comparative sphere of predicate 
and subject the extension in which they have 
with regard to each other these are attri 
buhve and substitutive judgments the for 
mer have a predicate of undefined extent the 
latter a predicate exactly equal in sphere that 
is in the objects it embraces to the subject 
it may appear that we here transgress the 
bounds of logical form in prescribing a dis 
tinction which presupposes a knowledge of the 
matter of the terms rather than of the nexus 
but a moments reflection will show that the 
nexus itself although expressed in both kinds 
by est and nonest is perfectly dififerent in 
the former est means is included in in the 
latter it may be rendered equals we have 
remedied the grammatical defect by retaining 



 laws of thought 

est for the copula in attributive judgments and 
adopting the mathematical sign of equality 
in substitutive the predicate of an attributive 
judgment belongs to the predicable of attribute 
that of a substitutive to the predicable dei 
nition 

§ — the common division of judg 
ments as to relation 

judgments are commonly divided into cate 
gorical hypothetical and disj unctive the first 
as explained by those who adhere to this divi 
sion expresses a relation between two concep 
tions as subject and predicate sls ais jb the 
hypothetical a relation between two judgments 
as condition and conditionate the condition 
being termed the antecedents and the condition 
ate the cotisequent as if a is b x is y 
the disjunctive between two or more judgments 
opposed to each other as excluding one another 
but ibaling up when taken together the sphere 
of all possible cases as to that particular subject 
matter as either a is b or it is c or it is d 
it remains to show how the membra dividentia 
of this division may be absorbed into those of 
ours 



judgments 

§ — the same dispensed with 

of categorical judgments all the negatives 
and part of the affirmatives rank under the class 
of attributives the remaining affirmatives 
those namely where the predicate is but a new 
representation of the same objects as the sub 
ject belong to the substitutive or defining 
class 

hrpothetical are referred to the class of 
categoricals as may easily be shown for the 
hrpothetical is a sentence consisting of two 
judgments connected as cause and efifect the 
antecedent setting forth the cause and the con 
sequent the efifect the nexus is to be sought 
not in antecedent or consequent separately but 
in the way they are combined now this way 
is no other than the way in which the terms of 
a categorical are combined for when we affirm 
that if a is b x is y what is it but to say 
that the caseyfacty or notion of as being jb 
is a caseyfacty or notion of xs being yf 
compare this with any other categorical affirm 
ation and no logical — no formal — difference can 
be found a is b asserts that b goes to 
make up the notion of a if a is b x is y 
asserts in like manner that x being y goes to 



 laws of thought 

make up the notion of a being b accordingly 
we refer hypotheticals to categoricals and to 
the substitutive or attributive class of these 
according to the relative sphere of the predi 
cate 

as for disjunctives they too are reducible to 
categorical judgments their subject is a con 
ception and their predicate the same conception 
logically divided ex gr either a is b or 
m is n or y is z is readily resolved into 
 the possible cases in this matter are that 
a is b m is n and y is z as it thus ap 
pears that subject and predicate differ in form 
but not in matter which constitutes a substi 
tutive judgment see § to that class we 
refer them 

inductive judgments also maybe ranked as sub 
stitutives for in them the subject is a divided 
conception and the predicate the same concep 
tion undivided they are the converses of dis 
junctives and have the same properties all 
inductive judgments may be exhibited by the 
formula ar jr a as all disjunctives may 
be by a a y z 



judgments 

§ — of modality as a formal part 

of judgments 

aristotle an pr i pacian division has 
divided judgments into three kinds according 
to the mode in which they are held true i pro 
blematical which are possibly true but neither 
subjectively nor objectively certain ii asser 
torial which are subjectively true but not ob 
jectively i e are valid for the thinker himself 
but not binding on others and iii apodictical 
which are true both for the thinker and for all 
others kant has assigned to this division 
the name of modality and has decided that 
it belongs to the form of thought assigning 
it an equal rank with quantity quality and 
relation 

on the exactness of the division of modality 
it must be noticed that to many the class of 
judgments called problematical appear not to 
be judgments at all but mere expressions of an 
act of comparison which precedes the formation 
of a judgment for in such sentences as man 
is possibly immortal we are essaymg to form 
a judgment that is to predicate one conception 
of another but have not yet done so these 
would perhaps prefer adopting the division of 



 laws of thought 

clauberg a cartesian logician who makes only 
two classes of judgments the necessary and 
those of moral certainty the etymology of 
which last phrase contains the characteristic of 
the class to which it is apphed being that class 
in which a subjective certainty influencing our 
manners moralis but not sufficient to con 
vince others finds place 

§ — reasons for rejecting it 

modality has been objected to and i think 
with justice as extralogical but the question 
of its admission or rejection is perhaps the 
most dildgicult in all logic and requires some 
consideration 

is modality part of the form of every judg 
ment if it be it must be something in the 
judgment itself any change in which would 
change the judgment thus if an assertorial 
judgment become an apodictical it is actually 
on this view a new judgment now all parties 
will allow that the points of form in a judgment 
reside in the copula or nexus that is that in 
some a is by there is a different nexus from 
that in all a is by and so on but when we 
come to apply this admission to modality 
opinions are again at issue the kantian 



judgments 

would urge that the nexus in an assertorial is 
quite distinct from that in an apodictical judg 
ment which his opponent denies declaring 
that the est or nonest of an assertorial and apo 
dictical have the same force and value on 
this douhtful point depends the present ques 
tion which those who do not understand it 
have settled in a very summary manner see p 
 note 

now it is plainly no answer to the kantian 
to say that the difference of nexus does not 
appear in the sign or word expressing it since 
the same argument would hold against quan 
tity as well as modality for in men are mortal 
and men are ingeniousy though the former is 
universal and the latter particular the nexus 
is just the same as far as appears defects in 
the signs of thought do not affect thought it 
self 

a hetter reason for dismissing modality is 
found in the fact that it is so intimately 
blended with psychological matters as to render 
it at least expedient to refer it to psychology 
for the enumeration of degrees of modality 
given by kant is not complete neither is the 
following though more ample 

l 



 laws of thouqht 

as to modality a judent may be 

a possible where no discrepancy appears 
between subject and predicate because we 
have not examined 

 dotibtfuly where after some trials of 
instances a few are favourable to the judg 
ment a few doubtful 

y prohahle where of a few trials all are 
favourable 

s morally certain for him who judges 
where the induction of favourable trials is 
wide enough to control his own belief not 
that of others 

ff morally certain for him and some 
others viz those of like character and modes 
of thought as a sect or a school 

f physically certain clauberg with 
a limit where the judgment grounds on an 
induction cognisable by all men which they 
believe complete but still admitting of over 
throw if future induction should contradict 
it of this sort are most truths in natural 
history as that all rostrate animals are 
birds proved erroneous by the discovery 
of the omithofynchus 

 physically certain without limitation 
where we know that the induction is com

canoes 



 metaphysically certain clauberg 
where the notion of the predicate enters into 
the subject as god is immortal here 
the proposition of contradiction as it is 
called applies for we say if not immortal 
then not god 

now it is plain that these kinds of judgment 
are distinguished from each other by the con 
dition of the particular thinker rather than by 
a real difference in the cognitions themselves 
available for and tangible by every intellect 
they may be presented to in other words 
the same judgment is commonly held by any 
two thinkers with different degrees of cer 
tainty nay some minds are so constituted as 
to be without one or more of the classes enu 
merated there is therefore every proba 
bility that modality lies wholly in the thinker 
and not in each of his judgments and though 
it is not convincing to say that it does not 
appear in the nexus it is at least nearly so to 
find that no examination of that nexus gives 
the slightest ground for distinguishing firom it 
between say a probable and morally cer 
tain judgment on these grounds leave we

§ — universal and particular use 

of conceptions in judgments 

see § 

in judging since conceptions to be compared 
commonly have not the same extension and 
again since the purposes of thought do not 
always require us to decide on the whole of a 
conception the particular use of conceptions be 
comes necessary it is known from iheform 
of a judgment what terms in it are distributed 
and what undistributed 

i quantity universal judgments distribute 

their subject particulars do not 
ii quality negative judgments distribute 

the predicate affirmatives do not 

e g no a is b distributes its predicate 

b for let b be undistributed then there 



 laws of thought 

is some part of b from which a is not ex 
cluded by the judgment it is therefore 
possible to affirm a of b and thus a is 
b can be true at the same time with no 
a is b but contrary judgments see 
below on opposition cannot be true toge 
ther sa these are contraries therefore 
the same judgments can and cannot be true 
together which is absurd 
iii relation substitutive judgments distri

for let the predicate be undistributed then 
a only a part of b and thus b is greater 
than a therefore not it thus the 
same thing is and not a which is 
absurd 

§ — different kinds of judgments 

it does not strictly belong to universal logic 
to enumerate different kinds of judgments ac 
cording to their value application or matter 
but since there are certain divisions which should 
be known yet are not laid down in the common 
systems of applied logic little apology is ne 
cessary after this caution for introducing them 
here 



judgments 

§ — theoretical and practical 
judgments 

judgments according to the end they have in 
view are divided into theoretical in which 
something is declared to he and their end is 
theory or speculation and practical in which 
something is declared capahle of heing done or 
the present concession of this possibility is de 
manded and their end is practice 

§ — demonstrable and indemon 
strable judgments 

judgments according to their manifestness 
evidentia are divided into indemonstrable or 
those which are manifest from the very terms 
and demonstrable or those which are not thus 
manifest but require a demonstration 

§ — the two preceding divisions 
regarded together

gain definitions of

another is sometimes called a corollary or

science in which it appears but is taken from 
another is called a lemma one which illus 
trates in some way the science where it appears

§ — syllogism consequence 

syllogism in general is the deduction of one 
judgment £rom one or two others according 
to certain laws the connexion between the 
judgment so deduced and that from which it 
comes is called the consequenccy though some 
times this title is metonymically applied to the 
deduced judgment itself 

§ — immediate and mediate 
consequence 

immediate consequence is where one judg 
ment can be deduced from another without the 
intervention of a third mediate consequence 
where a third and intermediate judgment is 
employed it is a fundamental property of all 
consequence that no absolutely new judgment 
is generated by it the explicit declaration of a

immediate consequence 

§ — kinds of immediate consequence 

there are several sorts of immediate conse 
quence which may be divided into two classes 
i those where the conclusion or judgment de 
duced differs in form from the premiss or 
ground of the deduction but not in matter 
that is not in the cognitions compared but in 
the mode of comparing them ii where the con 
clusion differs in matter from the premiss by 
additions made to it yet where the consequence 
is a priori certain and according to rules 
known without reference to the objects com 
pared

§ — opposition 

two judgments of the same matter but differ

and the relation they bear to each other is that 
of opposition in many kinds of opposition 
there is involved an immediate consequence 
either of amotion wherein the establishing of 
one judgment necessitates the removal or over 
throw of its opposite — or of position wherein 
the establishing of the one also establishes the 
other

§ — immediate consequence by con 
tradictory opposition 

contradictory opposition is the relation be 
twixt two judgments differing in quantity and 
quality but not in relation consequently they 
must be as to relation attributives since sub 



syllogisms 

stitutives cannot differ in quality it exists 
between a and o £ and i 

from the position of any judgment the amo 
tion of its contradictory follows as the immediate 
consequence and again from the amotion of a 
judgment follows the position of its contradic 
tory for the two can neither be trae nor false 
together 

scholion as to the matter of contradictory 
judgments it is not enough that they contain 
representations of the same objects but of the 
same objects under the same circumstances 
otherwise the contradiction may be merely a 
specious not a real one the circumstances to 
be attended to may be reduced to four heads 
the contradiction must be of the same judgment

judgments differing in quality i e between a

repugnant opposition 

repugnant opposition exists where of two 
judgments of one quality each distributes one 
term but each a diflferent one a and y 

the position of one implies the amotion of 
the other but not vice versa 

§ — conversion of judgments and 
immediate consequence by it 

an alteration in the relation which is defined 
the respect in which the two terms stand to 
each other of a judgment so that the two terms 
be transposed provided it be done according to 
certain laws is termed conversion the judg 
ment before this alteration we term the con 
vertend after it the converse the position 
of the convertend implies the position of the 
converse as its immediate consequence 



syllogisms 

§ — different kinds of conversion 

there are two kinds of conversion both pos 
sessing the marks of a transposition of subject 
and predicate j preservation of the same 
quality in convertend and converse 

these kinds are i simple conversion which 
has the above marks and which also y pre 
serves the same quantity in convertend and 
converse e i and a are converted in this 
manner 

ii accidental conversion which differs 
irom the former in changing the quantity a 
and y are converted by it some logicians 
assert that £ may be but this is not the case 
it may indeed be converted simply and then 
its subaltemate inferred but though the result 
looks uke an accidental conversion it is at 
tained in reality by a double process viz an 
inference by conversion and another by oppo 
sition 

 si quaeras car haec conversio dicatur per accidens 
ego de nominis ratione non sam admodum solicitas 
satis est qaod soliti fuerint logici sic loqui deque est 
necesse at rerum domina utat sine ratione imposita 
mutemns waius 



 laws of thought 

§ — laws op conversion 

l no term should he distributed in the con 
verse which was not in the convertend for 
the convertend being the sole ground of the 
converse from which the latter may be ga 
thered a priori it follows that we must not 
draw a conclusion wider than the ground war 
rants which will occur if we violate this law 

ii no term should be undistributed in the 
converse which in the convertend was distri 
buted for we should be able to reconvert the 
judgment and this we cannot do unless we 
preserve the full extent of the terms in the 
converse for example let all a is b be er 
roneously converted some b is a then from 
this converse being which distributes neither 
term § we cannot gain the former judg 
ment all a is b which as a distributes 
its subject § without violating the first 
law of conversion 

compliance with these laws it is which pro 
duces accidental conversion

§ — immediate consequence by 

privative conceptions 

see § 

in this kind of inference the matter of the 
consequent is different from that of the ground 
and not the form merely as in the preceding 
but the difference is strictly limitable by the 
form of conceptions § and therefore not 
extralogical the laws of privative conse 
quence are — i where the positive concep 
tion is affirmed of another the privative may 



 bnt o may be changed into i on the principles 
stated and 



 laws of thought 

be deniedi by inference and vice versa as 
 a is b • no a is nonb some a is 
not b • some nonb is a ii where a 
positive is affinned of a positive by inference 
the privative of one may be affirmed of the 
privative of the other provided always that 
if there be an undistributed term in the ground 
its privative shall stand subject in the conse 
quent as a is b • nonb is nona some 
a b • nona is nonb if no term is 
distributed as in i there is no privative con 
sequence if both terms then the privative of 
either may stand subject 

scholion though here is transposition of 
terms it is no logical conversion because the 
terms are changed as well as transposed 

§ — immediate consequence by added 

determinants 

a determinant is a mark added to a concep 
tion to render its tise § more contracted 
it is by the addition of determinants that we 
form inferior from higher conceptions but the 
addition of a determinant does not necessarily 
change the conception as may be gathered from 
its symbol the word expressing it and in these 
cases where the conception remains pltts the 



syllogisms 

determinant the fouowing consequence holds 
from any judgment as a ground the same judg 
ment with hoth its terms further determined 
i e having determinants added may be in 
ferred as a consequent provided i that no de 
terminant be added to one term which is not to 
the other and ii that the same distribution of 
terms be in the consequent which was in the 
 ground ba gr all a is b all a x is 
blx 

§ — immediate consequence by com 
pounded conceptions 

one conception may enter another as a mark 
as a tyrant into the slayer of a tyrant 
hence arises an immediate consequence from 
a judgment of simple conceptions as a ground 
may be inferred as a consequent a judgment 
of compound conceptions into which the sub 
ject and predicate of the ground enter as marks 
of subject and predicate respectively and which 
excepting these marks is tautologous exgr 
a triangle is a figure therefore he who con 
structs a triangle constructs a figure here too 
the distribution of the incorporated terms must 
be preserved 



 laws of thought 

§ — immediate consequences by dis 
junction 

a disjunctive judgment is a substitutive 
whose predicate is the subject divided into mem 
bers which taken together make up the subject 
the process of forming such a predicate we 
have already mentioned as division from one 
of its rules namely that what is in one member 
cannot be in any other which is called the rule 
of mutual exclusion § there arises an im 
mediate consequence from a disjunctive as the 
ground may be inferred the exclusion of one 
membrum from the others and again from 
another rule that the membra must exhaust the 
divisum § we gain another immediate con 
sequence ftrom a disjunctive as the ground 
may be inferred as a consequent that the part of 
the divisimi not in one membrum must be in 
one of the others

mediate consequence 

§ — a mediate consequence or medi 
ate syllogism is the illation of one judg 
ment from two others in which it is implicitly 
contained 

mediate consequence is founded on this 
canon — the agreement or repugnance of one 
conception from another is ascertained by a 

o 



 laws of thought 

third conception which either agrees with one 
or with both of the conceptions to he com 
pared 

§ — parts op a mediate syllogism 

it appears from the canon that a mediate syl 
logism contains three conceptions which are 
called termsi namely the suhject and predicate 
of the conclusion and the third term used as a 
mean of comparison the suhject of the coni 
elusion heing the term ahout which the whole 
is mainly concerned is emphatically the subject 
of the syllogism and this i propose to term the 
primus quoad nos its old name of minor 
never having been appropriate and being ren 
dered now stiu less so by the introduction of 
the identical judgments u and y the predi 
cate of the conclusion is called the tertius its 
former name of major being discarded for a 
similar reason the third term with which 
each of the others is compared is called as be 
fore the medius or middle 

as the canon requires three terms so it re 
quires three judgments in the first of these 
the medius is compared with the tertius quon 
dam major and this judgment is the proposi 
tion 



syllogisms 

in the second the medius is compared with 
the primus quondam minor and this com 
parison forms the assumption the two names 
proposition and assumption are used as purely 
arbitrary titles here and not as denoting any 
particular qualities of the judgments they signify 

and in the third the primus is compared 
with the tertius the judgment so formed being 
styled the conclusion or sometimes the ques 
tion complexion consequence inference or illa 
tion 

the proposition and assumption together are 
named the premisses 

§ — order of the premisses 

logicians are nearly unanimous in placing the 
proposition before the assumption and as it is 
desirable to change nothing except the evil of 
novelty is overbalanced by some gain as to cor 
rectness we preserve this order here thomas 
hobbes adopts the contrary order and i confess 
that his plan appears to be in by far the majority 
of cases most consistent with the natural order 
not to mention a strong argument to be drawn 
in its favour from the evident natural correct 
ness of the sorites which has premisses in this 
order an enumeration of cases of each may be 



 laws of thought 

found in hallams literature ofeurope vol 
iii p 

§ qq — the syllogistic figures 

syllogisms have been divided into three 
classes or figures according to the position of 
the medius in the premisses in the jirt 
figure the medius is subject of the proposition 
and predicate of the assumption in the second 
it is predicate of both in the third subject of 
both 

a fourth figure in which the medius is pre 
dicate of the proposition and subject of the as 
sumption has been added but it is at least un 
necessary and is described as a useless perver 
sion of the first with instead of the proper 
conclusion the converse of it gained by imme 
diate inference § and 

schohon it is not certain who is the 
inventor of the fourth figure nor would it 
confer immortality on his name if ascertained 
the following passage contains the commonly 
received opinion of the matter invenit 
galenus quartam hancce figuram ut ei 
attribuit averroes in cap viii lib i prior

tant nihil de hac figura legimus sed in aliis

§ — general rules of syllogisms 

the following rules are educed from the canon 
of mediate inference § in which the word 
agreement means either an agreement of coin 
cidence where one term is definitive of another 
or of inclusion where one term comprehends 
the other — and they are gained by applying 



 zabarella apud frobesium 



 laws of thought 

the canon to every possible combination of 
three terms in three figures 

r i in every syllogism there are three 
terms only 

remark this is implied by the canon 
which only requires two terms to be com 
pared and a third by which txi compare 
them 
r ii jeach term must he compared with 
every other 

remark this too is implied by the 
canon for the medius must be used with 
the other two severally and the result ex 
pressed by comparing the two 
r iii both premisses cannot he negative 
remark this also is plainly supposed 
m the canon for negatives express dis 
agreement of terms and if both are nega 
tive then the medius disagrees both with 
primus and tertius but the canon § 
only allows disagreement with one of 
them 
r iv the medius must he distributed 
§ once 

remark else the primus might be 
compared with one part of it and the 
tertius with another which in reality 
would warrant no comparison of them 



syllogisms 

r v not i if i oy nor o can he the 
premisses 

remark for the judgments these 
towels denote see § the old rule 
was — both premisses cannot be particular 
— here changed because they may be par 
ticular if y form one of them y has the 
property unknown to other particulars of 
distributing a term without necessitating 
a distribution in the conclusion as 
premisses offend r iv violate r vi 
and o i either r iv or r vi according 
to the figure 

rules for the conclusion 

r vi no term distributed § and 
in the condition unless in the premisses 

remark unless the whole of a term 
has been compared with the medius we 
cannot argue either agreement or the re 
verse of the whole of that term we should 
be judging about what had not been com 
pared 
r vii a negative premiss must have a 
negative conclusion 

remark a negative premiss denotes 
that one term is repugnant to the medius 



 laws of thought 

and if so then according to the canon the 
primus and tertius themselves are repug 
nant which can only he expressed hy a 
negative 
r viii i or o as premiss must have a 
particular conclusion 

remark here y is again excepted 
for the property mentioned at r v to 
violate the present rule invariahly implies 
the violation of some other as may he 
found hy experiment in any figure 
r ix if the primus as used is wider by 
position than the tertiusy the conclusion can 
not be universal 

remark the term wider by posi 
tion only applies to syllogisms into which 
u and y enter as premisses the nexui 
of equality between the terms u and y 
enables us in certain cases to know a 
priori that one term is of greater exten 
sion § than another for example if 
a be included in b and c be equal to b 
it is plain that c is wider than a for it is 
as wide as what includes it the words 
 as used mean as much of it as is 
used 
r x no conclusion can be an identical 



syllogisms 

or substitutive judgment unless one of the 
premisses is so 

remark infraction of this rule asserts 
a relation between the terms of the con 
clusion which the premisses have not war 
ranted it compels a violation of r vi 
r xi no conclusion can be an identical 
judgmenty where the primus as used is nar 
rower by position than the tertitts 

remark thus if b be equal to a 

and some c be in b then some c cannot 

be equal to a otherwise the contained 

would be equal to what is as wide as the 

containing which is absurd 

r xii if in the premisses a term be dc 

dared equal to the mediusy and the medius 

when compared with the other term be undis 

tributed then the term that is equal cannot be 

distributed in the conclusion 

remark for if a term be equal to 
another as man is to rational animal 
then what is affirmed of part of one can 
only be affirmed so far of part of the other 
for the objects they represent are the 
same 
r xiii except in the cases affected by the

last three rules any term distributed in the 
premisses may be so in the conclusion

we cannot gather from premisses moe 
than is set down in them we are war 
ranted in gathering as much as is so set 
down 

§ — of the modes 

every combination of premisses and conclu 
sion in any figure is called a mode and these 
vary with the quantity quality and relation 
of the judgments adopting the vowels to 
signify the various kinds of judgments § 
we are enabled to express any mode by three 
vowels of which the first denotes the quantity 
quality and relation of the proposition the 
second the same of the assumption the third 
the same of the conclusion k the number of 
the figure be added we can at once exhibit 
the whole logical properties of the syllogism

§ — that reduction is unnecessary 

reduction is described as the process of 
bringing a syllogism from an imperfect to a 
perfect figure in explanation of which we are 
told that the second and third are imperfect 
figures and the first the sole perfect one this 
perfection is merely a direct conformity with the 
dictum of aristotle categ ch but as in 
fact the said dictum only applies to the first 
figure it is ridiculous to call the others imper 
fect for not conforming to what does not con 
cern them in the present treatise i have 
accommodated the canon or dictum to all the 
figures and consider inference in one as per 
fect as in another as there can be no need 
then for exhibiting a syllogism in a new and 
not more perfect figure it is dispensed with 
not so however some of the processes which 
it employed in bringing its terms to the proper 
order they will be found under their old title 
of conversion among the immediate inferences 
but in place of the rejected process it may be 
as well here to explain how syllogisms can be 
exhibited in a less cumbrous manner than by 
the table already given from which explana 
tion the logical reader will gather incidentally 
the principle on which reduction is grounded 



syllogisms 

to have knowledge is possible in two ways 
says greek philosophy first the knowledge 
may be active and present to our consciousness 
second it may be quiescent and dormant so as 
that we are not conscious of it and yet may 
become so by an act of memory without recur 
ring to the original sources whence we derived 
it now in evoking a dormant cognition into 
activity we may observe that what was single 
and one when at rest may assume two or three 
shapes when put into motion for example 
if one knows that philip was attacked and 
beaten by peter our cognition respecting it 
when at rest is nothing more than a concep 
tion of a certain relation between two persons 
and is one but when we come to bring our 
cognition into internal discourse it becomes two 
for we either think that phikp was beaten by 
peter or that peter beat philip two distinct 
thoughts though relating to one fact in read 
ing from the tablet of our mind we may bring 
forward the images in one order or in another 
this doctrine is the statics and dynamics of 
thinking the principle which suggests one 
order rather than another is the more imme 
diate direction of our consciousness to one part 
of the representation for the leading notion 



 laws of thought 

or subject in the cognition may be sought from 
any part of the representation if complex 
thus philip was beaten by peter answers to 
the question what has befallen philip the 
notion of philip being the subject or that 
about which the thought is whereas peter 
has beaten philip is a thought more directly 
about peter in brief then out of absolutely 
the same subjective materials the mind may 
construct two or more thoughts according to 
the part of the materials whence it seeks its 
leading notion or subject and though these 
braininscribed materials are no thoughts until 
the consciousness is directed towards them we 
may by a metaphor term them thoughts at 
rest 

and this metaphor will help to explain the 
doctrine of the three figures of syllogisms one 
dormant syllogism may be awakened into dif 
ferent forms according to the order in which 
we direct our attention towards its component 
conceptions and as the truth i e selfcon 
sistency of our thinking depends on our con 
struction of each of the forms consistently with 
this dormant type so if we can adequately re 
present the type we shall be able to discover 
the ground of this internal truth compendiously 



syllogisms ill 

it may also subserve a mnemonic use espe 
cially in abstruse subjects to ascertain not the 
two or more syllogisms formed from the type 
but the type itself this may be done simply 
by representing the terms of a cognition by 
circles whose mutual position expresses the 
position of the conceptions in the type as to 
each other thus the judgment a univ aflf 
attr is represented by one circle within ano 
ther the less being its subject the greater its 
predicate an example perhaps may be the 
best explanation the syllogism aaa fig 
i § may be figured by three concentric 
circles 




let a b and c be three conceptions of which 
the first includes the second and the second the 
third now let each have a particular value 
let a stand for mortal for many and let c 



 laws of thought 

represent king our cognition of these objects 
as reposited in our mind stands as is here re 
presented i e as to extenstouy § the cod 
ception king is included in many and man in 
mortal and in evoking this reposited knowledge 
we may use the mode — a a a fig i as the 
readiest form 

thus aaa fig i 

all men are mortal 

all kings are men 

all kings are mortal 
here kings were the subject of thought to 
which we seek to attribute or not the conception 
of mortality y through means of that of humun 
ity but change the subject of thought which 
is always the primus or minor and let it be a 
instead of c the syllogism may stand 

y y y fig i 

some m£n kings or are all kings 

some mortal beings men 

some mortal beings kings 
comparing this with the last it will be found 
that the premisses of either simply converted 
§ and then transposed become the pre 
misses of the other that in short one is the 



syllogisms 

other backwards but both are adequately re 
presented by the single diagram above which 
diagram may stand for both and for any others 
if any there be which express a gradation of in 
clusion amongst three conceptions this hint 
may be used in practising logical analysis one 
remark must be made which is we are never to 
exhibit more in the diagram than the cognition 
warrants a fault we might easily slide into in 
particular judgments in the judgment i part 
afif attr we may not infer that because some 
a if b therefore some also is nou for all a 
may be b though we have not ascertained it 
so we must express it in diagram 

thus and not thus 





§ — f the hypothetical syllogism 
a spurious kind and its reduction 

the hypothetical syllogism has a hypothetical 
judgment for its major and a categorical for 

q 



 laws of thought 

minor which categorical must either assert the 
antecedent or deny the consequent of the 
major 

syuogisms sometimes assume the hypotheti 
cal form which are nothing more than catego 
ricals disguised most commonly hy the intrusioii 
of the minor term into the major premiss 
for example 

spirits are invisihle 

departed souls are spirits 

 departed souls are invisihle 
may stand 

if departed souls are spirits they are invisi 
hle 

they are spirits 

• they are invisible 
such a syllogism differs in no respect from a 
cryptical § one of the common kind to 
which it is immediately reducible by discarding 
the intruding term the subject of both ante 
cedent and consequent and forming the major 
of the two remaining predicates this plan of 
reduction is to be followed in all causes where 
the subject of antecedent and consequent is 
the same and the truth of the hypothetical 
depends solely on the truth of the categorical 
it covers 



syllogisms 

there are four moods of this kind o hypo 
thetical syllogism two in which the minor 
denies or takes away part of the major called 
modi tollentes and two in which it lays down 
part of the major called modi ponentes of 
these four two have place when the concealed 
major is an attributive two more when it is an 
identical or substitutive judgment 

the four moods are i to argue from the 
position i e the establishing for truth of the 
antecedent to the position of the consequent 
example 

if god is infinitely wise he must be infi 
nitely good 
and he is infinitely wise 
therefore he is infinitely good 
ii from the amotion i e the denial of the 
consequent to the amotion of the antecedent 
example 

 if men were truly charitable they would 
abstain from aggression 

they do not abstain from aggression 
and therefore are not truly charitable 
iii the cryptical categorical being here as 
to relation a substitutive or defining judg 
ment from the amotion of the antecedent 
to the amotion of the consequent example 



 laws of thought 

m 

if brutes have the faculty of choosid in 
two or more equally possible thingsy that 
which best pleases them they have free 
will 
but they have not this feculty 
therefore they have not free will 
iv the categorical being a defining jadg 
ment from the position of the conseqaoit 
to the position of the antecedent example 
if sir thomas browne displays erudition 
he displays knowledge gained by exten 
sive reading 
now he does display knowledge gained by 

extensive reading 
therefore he displays erudition 
it must be repeated that unless the concealed 
categorical be an identical or defining jodg 
ment the two last moods are invalid 



§ — the true hypothetical 

the only hypothetical deserving a separate 
name and explanation is that wherein one notion 
is affirmed of another in the consequent under 
a certain condition only expressed by the ante 
cedent the predicate of the antecedent not 
standing to that of the consequent as species to 



syllogisms 

genus but the two members being related as 
cause and effect it has been held that this 
kind of hypothetical syllogism is sui generis 
nor can possibly be reduced into a categorical 
i hope to shew that it is already a categorical 
requiring no farther alteration than a slight one 
in the symbols it employs at present calculated 
to mislead 

the copula though always found in a judg 
ment often occurs when no judgment takes 
place and this is true in the matter in hand for 
the antecedent and consequent of a hjrpothe 
tical judgment severally contain a copula and 
yet are no judgments at all but merely com 
pound conceptions for let any one examine 
an example of this if a is b x is y he will 
find that he neither affirms b of a nor y of x 
therefore they are no judgments but he does 
affirm x y of a b or in other words the 
compound conception a determined by is 
the subject to a predicate formed by the com 
pound conception x determined by y and 
all true hypothetical should be expressed as 
categoricals by the following change 

if aisb xisy 

aub 

 x is y 



 laws of thought 

reduced to 

the case of a being b is a case of x 

being y 
this is a case of a being b 
 this is a case of x being y 
and the syllogism as thus expressed pos 
sesses every qualification of a syllogism of the 
mood a a a of the first figure without hav 
ing lost any property possessed before 

§ — of disjunctive syllogisms 

a disjunctive syllogism is one which has a 
disjunctive judgment for its proposition a 
judgment of this kind has already been shewn 
to belong to the class of identical or defining 
judgments but the truth is such a one is not 
the real proposition of the syllogism bearing 
its name but a categorical derived immediately 
from it for example 

all a is b or c 

it is not b 

 it is c 
may be readily reduced by substituting a premiss 
fairly deducible § from the disjunctive for 
the disjunctive itself it will then stand 

all a that is not b is c 



syllogisms 

this is an a that is not b 

 this is c 
the principle of disjunctive judgments will 
appear from the rules of division it is briefly 
this — what lies under a conception must lie in 
one or other of that conceptions dividing parts 
this holds whether there be two or more dis 
junct members in the judgment and where 
there are more than two the syllogism may 
still be exhibited in the categorical form thus 

a is b or c or d 

it is b 

 it is not c or d 
may be reduced 

all a that is b is neither c nor d 

this is a that is b 

 this is neither c nor d 
it may be observed that the formula given 
for the true hypothetical syllogism after re 
duction will be found convenient for disjunc 
tives the case of a being b c 

§ — cryptical syllogisms 

the term cryptical is applied to syllogisms 
which do not appear in scientific order but have 
undergone some change for brevity of thought 



 laws of thought 

or expression or some similar cause referring 
to what has been said of reduction § 
crypsis i e disguise is no error when it ade 
quately represents the type or pattern of the 
syllogism latent in the mind but for full appli 
cation of the rules of deduction we are com 
pelled to remove it by supplpng ellipses re 
storing inversions and lopping off redundancies 
crypsis in syllogisms is the act of presenting 
reasoning in an inartificial shape the d priori 
validity of cryptical syllogisms can only be 
recognised when we have the two premisses 
given for the suppression of the conclusion can 
then be obviated but the want of a premiss can 
only be supplied by an appeal to the objects of 
thought crypsis which was probably first 

treated of by ramus and his followers may 

 

occur in many ways omission of the major or 
of the minor or of the conclusion inveron of 
the premisses or of the premisses and conclu 
sion iutersertion of extraneous terms or judg 
ments are each of them possible 

§ — enthymeme 

a cryptical syllogism produced by the sup 
pression of a premiss is called an enthymeme 
scholion a distinction must be made be 



syllogisms r 

tween the logical and rhetorical elnthymeme 
the logical i have just described the rhe 
torical as explained by aristotle is a syllo 
gism with a suppressed major which if filled 
up would be in a a a in any of the figures 
but we shall find on referring to the table 
§ that a a a is only logically valid in 
the first figure in the second it would con 
tain an undistributed middle in the third an 
illicit process of the minor the two last are 
therefore disowned by logic it may seem 
that arguments thus faulty should have no 
place either in logic or rhetoric it will 
however a little surprise many to learn that 
the mode of proof termed circumstantial 
evidence naturally assumes the shape of a 
string of rhetorical enthymeme of the second 
figure for example this man is the mur 
derer for he was near the spot he is the 
murderer for he was found with a discharged 
pistol he is the murderer for he trembled 
when we seized him he is the murderer for 
his clothes were torn as by resistance now 
singly every one of these is a faulty syllo 
gism but accumulated we find in them the 
ground — not from our logic but our experi 
ence—of the following judgment whoso 



f 



 laws of thought 

ever it not found in so many circumstances to 
differ from the murderer is the murderer 
and thence we frame a true logical argument 
condemning him and this last is properly 
the only logical step in the process 



§ — sorites 

a chain of judgments where the predicate of 
each is the suhject of the succeeding and the 
suhject of the first and the predicate of the 
last form the conclusion is termed a sorites 
lliis is nothing hut a chain of cryptical syllo 
gisms of which the first has no conclusion the 
last a conclusion hut no assumption and the 
rest neither assumption nor conclusion but as 
the conclusion of each serves for assumption to 
that which succeeds nothing more is requisite 
to exhibit the crrptical syllogisms as perfect 
than the intersertion of proper conclusions as 
they arise if the syllogisms into which it is 
thus resolved conform to the rules of mediate 
inference then only is the sorites proved to be 
correct the order of the premisses in a sor 
ites so evidently natural affords a strong argu 
ment that our placing the assumption ctfier the 
proposition is an arbitrary arrangement 



syllogisms

a is b b is c d is e

§ — epichereme or prosyllogism 

when a judgment is added to a premiss in 
proof of it and the cause of its being true the 
judgment added with the premiss it proves 
form an enthymeme called a prosyllogism or 
epichereme a prosyllogism then is defined — 
an enthymeme whose conclusion stands as pre 
miss in another syllogism 

§ — the dilemma 

with the dilemma as involving the discom 
fiture of an adversary which its common notion 
does we have nothing to do here because such 
matters are only accidental and extraneous to 
thinking and we are here to explain nothing 
but what is essential to and constitutive of it 
it is nothing else than a compound of two or 



 laws op thought 

more hypothetical syllogisms with the acci 
dental relation to the matter in hand that one 
of them must he true and whichever it is the 
adversary is discomfited 

the dilemma proper is a hypothetical syl 
logism of which either the antecedent or con 
sequent is disjunctive like the ordinary hy 
pothetical it has two modes the affirmative 
modus ponens and negative modus touens 
called respectively the constructive and de 
structive dilemma 

constructive dilemma 

if a is b or e is f then c is d 
but either a is b or £ is f 
 c is d 

the same exhibited categorically 

the cases of a heing b and e being f 

are cases of c being d 
this is a case of a being b or e being f 
 this is a case of c being d 

destructive dilemma 

k a is b then c is d or e is f 
but neither c is d nor e is f 
 a is not b 



syllogisms 

the same exhibited categorically 

the case of a being b is a case of c 

being d or e being f 
this is not a case of c being d or £ 

being f 
•• this is not a case of a being b 

schohon it may seem wrong to treat a 
judgment which both antecedent and conse 
quent appear to be as a conception still more 
to unite two seeming judgments in one con 
ception but it should be repeated first 
that the number of marks or determinations 
in a conception how great soever does not 
make it the less a conception provided the 
mind can and does combine them as one re 
presentation which is the case here in spite of 
the quasi copula and next that two or more 
of these qiuisi judgments may be united in 
one conception if regard be had to the princi 
ple of unity of representation thus george 
sand is a man or a woman here the expo 
nent of the unity in this disjoined predicate 
would be human creature of which man 
and woman are dividing members 



 laws of thought 

§ — induction 

according to the common perhaps to the 
universal teaching of logicians induction is a 
mode of reasoning sui generis many avoiding 
the attempt to reduce it to a syllogism at all 
and others finding in it a new and anomalous 
one not conforming to the rules of categoricals 
the error of these latter arose from no fault in 
their exhibition of the inductive argument but 
of their doctrine of syllogisms in general it 
can be shown that induction is but an ordinary 
syllogism with one substitutive judgment 

induction is the reasoning whereby we infer 
that something belongs to a whole because it 
belongs to a sufficient number of its parts in 
logical induction i e the induction which is 
valid a priori no enumeration less than entire 
is considered sufficient its canon being — what 
is true of all the parts of a conception is true of 
the whole positis omnibus partibus iisdemque 
junctis ponitur totum this is called com 
plete induction 

example in a u a fig iii 

x y z are b 

xyz a 
 all a is b 



syllogisms 

incomplete induction accepts an enumeration 
of instances less than the whole where the 
whole cannot be observed and this enumera 
tion may be either of many or of one case ac 
cording to the facilities of observation but it 
holds as an invariable rule that wherever an 
inductive judgment is made the basis of a pro 
cess of reasoning it is in some way held true as 
a complete induction 

scholion some psychologists have as 
serted that the induction from one instance 
only holds in cases of inward experience 
where connexionis necessarisb inter subjec 
tum et praedicatum probe nobis consciisumus 
later writers enumerate certain notes which 
a sound induction of the incomplete kind 
will possess such as i a ready identification 
with our conceptions of facts ii the power 
of predicting in cases yet unexamined iii 
the consilience of it with others where many 
and widely different lines of experience spring 
together into one theory which explains them 
all — see quarterly review no p
