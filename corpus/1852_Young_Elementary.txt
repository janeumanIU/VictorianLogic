introduction 



thb tenn logic is primarily derived from the greek word logos but 
more immediately from the french and signifies a word or an idea em 
bodied in language but this signification has been at various times 
extended so that the term in question has been frequently used to signify 
not only a word or simple idea embodied in language but also a discourse 
a reason in the sense of argument or proof the relsoning power itself and 
finally the reasoning process hence the name logic has assumed a 
signification more or less extended according to the views of the various 
writers that have treated upon this department of science 

there are some writers who have included under the scientific art of 
logic the whole range of mental philosophy in addition to this others 
have included the art of rhetoric a third have restricted it to the single 
process of deduction or of unfolding particular truths wrapt up in given 
premises while a fourth would confine it to the mental process of 
induction 

this diversity in the application of the term has given rise to much 
misconception and controversy not only has the name been misapplied 
but the nature design and legitimate province of the science been mis 
apprehended even by its friends and the greatest obloquy thrown upon 
it by its enemies in consequence of the preposterous and extravagant 
claims advanced by the former in behalf of their favorite science the 
result has been no less injurious to logic in particular than it has been 
detrimental to science and philosophy in general it would be fruitless 
to enter upon the particulars of these controversies being generally of so 
trivial and absurd a natqre it will be necessary therefore only to give 
such a general outline of the science as will assist the reader in his efforts 
to master its principles 

in treating of any science one of the first things to be attended to is 
to point out in as few words as possible its essential attributes or to give 



ttr introduction 

what is usually called a definition of it this is perhaps more difficult 
in the case of logic than of any other in the whole range of existing 
sciences the reason is ohvious in as much as logic must necessarily 
have to do with the whole field of human knowledge and the universal 
range of human intelligence it has been defined by some the theory 
or calculus of proof this definition is hardly satisfactory as it is con 
nected with every process of the human judgment perhaps it might be 
defined the scientific art which takes cognisance of inferential relations 
with the immediate knowledge of the judgment or the senses logic can 
have nothing directly to do but simply with that knowledge which comes 
to the mind through the medium of proof as the latter species of know 
ledge however is acquired by the mind in a threefold manner the rea 
soning science must naturally be considered under a threefold aspect — 

 the knowledge acquired of particular facts from other particular 

facts 

 the knowledge acquired by inductive generalizations 

 the knowledge acquired by deductive inferences 

some will no doubt consider the above definition faulty others that the 
reasoning process is the same whether connected with judgment induction 
or deduction it may be said also that it takes no notice of the cogniz 
ance which logic necessarily takes of language but let it be observed 
that logic only stands in a secondary relation to human language it 
takes cognizance of it only so far as it is the medium of human knowledge 
human reasoning and human communication it stands to it in precisely 
the same relation that the carpenters tools do in reference to the scientific 
art of ship building but the philosophy of language as silchy belongs 
entirely and exclusively to grammar 

in all reasoning whatever certain signs or symbols must be used by 
which other intelligent agencies may apprehend our inward cognitions 
so far then as language is the external sign or symbol of the minds 
conceptions logic as a member of the great commonwealth of sciences 
must necessarily feel a common interest in the common medium of our 
common nature nor is this all for as there is no well defined science 
but has its own peculiar or technical language for its own special use so 
it is and ought to be the case with logic 

in every process of reasoning there are the means of proof and the thing 
proved or what is generally called the premises and the comlusion 
whether this mental process be — 



introduction ul 

 the judging process 

 the generalizing process 

 the syllogising process 

premises again are made up of propositions and propositions are made 
up of terms it may be further observed that the terms joined by what 
is called the copula constitute a proposition for example the following 
terms — 



but 



caesar man ambitious miserable 

caesar was an ambitious man or 
caesar was a miserable man 



are propositions yet none of these as such contain a process of rea 
soning but simply an act of judgment of themselves they do not constitute 
an argument for every argument must consist of two things the roq and 
the thing proved but supposing we should ¦ say caesar was ambitious 
therefore he was miserable it would then be an argument 

arguments 

 this candle has burnt me therefore j 

that candle will bum me j assoaatoon 



 john peter and james are mortal 

these are men therefore generalization 

all men are mortal 



 



 all men are mortal 

james is a man therefore deduction 
james is mortal j 

these three arguments as above expressed show us the three modes in 
which the mind reasons if however the above argument caesar was 
ambitious therefore he was miserable should be objected to that 
objection must either apply to the assertion made or the conclusion inferred 
it may be denied that caesar was ambitious or it may be admitted 
but that it does not necessarily follow that he was miserable the major 
premise must therefore be first admitted all ambitious men are miser 
able before we infer in the conclusion that cceaar was miserable the 
logic of deduction takes cognizance of inferences such as these but is of 
no avail until we first obtain a major premise it is here where the logic 
of induction comes into play in order to supply what may be termed 
generalized premises not intuitive principles how then are we to 



iv qitboduotion 

obtain the major premise all ambitious men are miserable if logic 
had merely to do with mere deduction its sphere of usefulness would be 
very limited and comparatively of little value 

the only way in wliich to obtain the generalized conclusion that all 
ambitious men are mortal is by induction only true there is a mental 
process prior to induction this i admit this is called by logicians sim 
ple perception observation an act of judgment c or what may be 
called the investigating process but let it be observed that even here 
logic comes into full play except merely in the case of the intuitive per 
ceptions whether arising from an internal or external condition these 
being primary and fundamental elements of human knowledge with which 
the judgment has nothing directly to do for example — 



objective 



 i see the table 

 i smell the rose 



s i tasted the wine 
 i heard the noise 



 i felt the blow 



subjective 



 i do exist i i am conscious 

 i think reason c 

these are sometimes called acts of judgment but the judgment as 
such has nothing to do with them and only commences its functions after 
the immediate knowledge of consciousness and the semes is supplied bat 
in what is called the investigating process the element of reasoning is intro 
duced so as to discover sufficient hcts for generalizing this generalizing 
process may be called a reasoning but not a syllogistic or deciphering 
process thus why do i believe that the sun will rise tomorrow €• 
is it a simple inference i apprehend not it is an inductive belief in 
the uniformity of sequences in nature immediately based upon a mental 
generalization occasioned by previous experience it is from the want of 
giving sufficient attention to this generalizing element in human nature 
that our modem logicians have so greatly misconceived and so grossly 
perverted the principles of this noble science 

it has been already observed that there are four mental processes con 
nected with reasoning 



intbobuotion 

 the perception of fietcts or ideas 

 the judgments of reason 

 the induction of generalizationb 
 the deduction of inferences 

the first has strictly speaking to do with metaphysics and does not come 
within the legitimate province of logic though it is of the utmost importance 
to the logician to he thoroughly acquainted with the metaphysical principles 
upon which these mental operations are based this perception of facts 
cognition of principles or passing of judgments are as we have already 
observed occasioned by observation and experience from thence the 
mind judges generalizes and infers

john is mortal 

genbbalizing frocbss infebbxtial prgcbss 

peter james and john are mortal all men are mortal 

these are men therefore john is a man therefore 

all men are mortal john is mortal 

the only way to guard against the errors of the first is to examine 
those sources whence human error springs the way to test an inductive 
syllogism is different to that by which a deductive syllogism is to be 
tested 

inductive test 

 if one fact can be adduced contradictory of the generalized conclusion 
the whole argument falls to the ground 

deductive test 

 whatever is predicated of a term distributed may be predicated in like 
manner of any thing contained imder that term 

having now given a short outline of what i apprehend to be the legitimate 
province of logic it will be necessary briefly to advert to the opinions of 
others in respect to this science the theory of aristotle is evidently that 
which confines the reasoning science to pure deduction watts includes 
within its range the philosophy of the mind and the art of rhetoric dr 
whately perceived the error of watts and mshed to the opposite ex 
treme but in seeug the mote in his neighbours he did not detect the 
beam in his own eye he confines the province of logjlc qsa

inference or the deciphering process leechman follows in the wake of 
the learned prelate mills strikes out a new path but his theory is 
neither fish nor flesh it is neither inductive nor deductive if it be any 
thing definite at all it is that all reasoning is from particulars to particulars 
de morgan has propounded some very refined speculations in connection 
with this science but his work as a logical treatise is of no practical 
value

having now briefly set forth the legitimate province of logic it will be 
as well to observe that reasoning is not confined as is generally sup 
posed to mere disputation mathematicians are constantly engaged in 
reasoning though their propositions are based upon incontrovertible proof 
the general theories of geometry are demonstrated by means of syllogisms 
founded upon the axioms and definitions the form of syllogisms 
employed in geometrical reasoning is of the simplest character every 
syllogism consists of three propositions of which two are called the 
premises and the third the conclusion these propositions contain three 
terms the subject and predicate of the conclusion and the middle term 
which connects the predicate and conclusion together the subject of the 
conclusion is called the minora and the predicate of the conclusion is called 
the major term of the syllogism the major term appears in one premise 
and the minor term in the other with the middle term which is in both 
premises that premise which contains the middle term and the major 
term is called the major premise and that which contains the middle 
term and the minor term is called the minor premise of the syllogism 
as an example we may take the first syllogism in the demonstration of 
prob i book i of euclid wherein it will be seen that the middle term 
is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor 



viu introduction 

mcqor premise — because the straight line a b is equal to the straight 

line a c and 
minor premise — because the straight hne b c is equal to the straight 

line a b therefore 
conclusion — the straight hne b g is equal to the straight line a c 
here b c is the subject and a c the predicate of the conclusion 

b c is the subject and a b the predicate of the minor premise 
a b is the subject and a c the predicate of the major premise 
also a c is the major term b c the minor term and a b the middle 
term of the syllogism 

in this syllogism it may be remarked that the definition of a straight 
line is assumed and the definition of the geometrical equality of two straight 
lines also that a general theoretic truths or axiom forms the ground of 
the conclusions 

this is no less true in every other department of science and philosophy 
where reasoning is employed whether in grammar history poetry 
geology or divinity if reasoning be at all employed logic takes cog 
nizance of it 

it has been a subject of dispute both in ancient and modem times 
whether logic be a science or an art some have considered it one some 
the other it is evidently both as a science it has to do with the laws 
and principles of reasoning itself whatever the subject matter may be as 
an art it lays down rules by which we are enabled to exhibit truth in all 
its clearness and to detect the various errors that vitiate the legitimacy of 
our conclusions as an art it does more for it regulates language the 
vehicle of human reasoning in the various logical forms which it assumes 
in argumentation to see its value let us take a few examples of fallacious 
reasoning 

i association 

j the sun shines by its own light therefore 
the moon shines by its own light 

 this rose has a sweet smell therefore 
that rose has the same 

 this cigar smokes well therefore 
that one will smoke well c 

the only way to test fallacious reasoning from particulars to particulars 
is by experience or judgment if the fallacy springs from material quali 
ties or the phenomena of nature it is to be tested by the senses if it 
springs from an assumed principle or relation then it is to be tested by 
the judgment 



introduction ix 

 induction 

bolingbroke volney paine voltarre eosseau and carlyle were 

notorious for their gross immorality of conduct 
these were modern infidel philosophers therefore 
all modern infidel philosophers were notorious for their gross im 
morality of conduct 

the way by which to test this syllogism is to ascertain if any fact can 
be found to contradict this generalised conclusion such a fact can be 
ascertained for david hume forms an honourable exception to this lot o 
worthies the argument as such therefore falls to the ground 

m deduction 

light is contrary to darkness 
feathers are light therefore 
feathers are contrary to darkness 

taght is the middle term in this syllogism which is ambiguous and 
therefore there are virtually two middle terms in sense though only one 
in sound 

white is a colour 

black is a colour therefore 

black is white 

the fallacy in this syllogism lies in the middle term also colour is 
not distributed or used in the whole of its extension or to represent the 
whole of its significates in the minor premise so that black was compared 
with one part of it and white with another part again — 

all men grow 

a woman grows therefore 

a woman is a man 

this is similar to the former take for example the following falla 
cious argument — 

every virtuous youth is attentive to his studies 
this youth is attentive to his studies therefore 
he is virtuous 

such an argument as this might easily be passed off as valid especially 
in the heat of discussion but so far as the validity of the reasoning is 
concerned it is precisely the same as the following — 



x introduction 

every man eats 

a dog eats therefore 

a dog is a man 

let us takft another example of fallacious reasoning — 

every ambitious man is miserable 

this person is not an ambitious man therefore 

he is not miserable 

this argument exactly corresponds with the following — 

every man has a power of beginning motion 

a horse is not a man therefore 

a horse has not the power of beginning motion 

or again — 

the dog barks 

the dog is a star therefore 

the star barks 

from these specimens of sophistical reasoning the necessity will be more 
clearly seen of having certain scientific rules whereby to detect the various 
fallacies that lurk in what may apparently be considered fair and legitimate 
argumentation and though natural sagacity may enable a person to 
expose the more apparent fallacies still how much more efficient would 
that natural sagacity be if it were expanded and developed by the best 
principles of scientific truth 

this logtc professes to do so far as reasoning is concerned but let it 
be observed that logic of itself will never make a reasoner it will not 
supply the materials of knowledge this must be acquired from every 
possible source honey must be collected from every flower and when the 
elements of knowledge are acquired then will logic assist us in presenting 
truth in her best and noblest form

operations of the mind 

connected with logic 



in every process of argumentation there are four distinct operations of the 
mind called into exercise — 

 the intuitive the inductive 

 the judging the syllogistic 

by the intuitive we gain our perceptions and ideas by the judging we 
cognize their relations and pronounce upon their agreement or disagree 
ment by the inductive we generalize these judgments and by the 
syllogistic process we unfold the particular principles wrapt up in these 
generalizations to analyse the action of these powers and investigate 
their phenomena in so far as they are purely mental operations unconnected 
with argumentation exclusively belongs to the science of metaphysics it 
is only so far as they are employed ia judging generalizing bxa sillogizingy 
that they come within the domain of logic the perceptions and ideas 
of intuition embodied in language are called terms the decisions of 
judgment when expressed are called propositions or judgments the pro 
cesses of induction are called generalizations and those of syuogism are 
called concltlsions but these however are all liable to defects terms 
may be indistinct vague and indefinite propositions may be false general 
izations inconect and conclusions jcdlaciotto it is the legitimate province 
of logic to guard against these defects by devising rules based on scien 
tific principles so as to have terms distinct and definite propositions true 
generalizations correct and conclusions based upon and part of the 
immutable principles of truth

part i — terms part il — propositions 

part i — terms 

in conducting the reasoning process it has been found necessary to 
employ technical language in defining terms explaining principles and 
laying down rules the first part of logic therefore treats of terms 
but terms may be vague indistinct and indefinite logic endeavours to 
guard against this as far as possible by assigning them a clear distinct 
and definite meaning by rules of — 

 distinction division 

 classification definition 

these are sometimes called logical instruments 

i distinction 

 verbal distinctions — the nature of verbal distinctions comes more 
properly under the cognisance of the science of grammar however as an 
example of them we may select the term cause strictly speaking there 
is but one catlse — the primary fountain of all being it is however 
applied both to animate and inanimate objects in a subordinate sense 
there is again distinctions in reference to subordinate causes the principal 
of which are — 

 the efficient cause from which the effect proceeds 

 the material cause of which it is produced 

 the formal cause the mode in which it is accomplished 

 the final cause the object designed or the end in view 

tnke the term watch — 

 the man that made it 

 the materials of which it was made 

 the mode in which it is accomplished 

 the end in view 

 modal distinctions — this refers to the manner in which words are 
employed for instance there are unwoccuy equwoccdy and analogmis 
terms they are not however be it observed distinct classes of terms but 
the same term used in either signification at the option of the writerr 
thus the term lady may be considered urdvoccu because it is only 
applicable in the same sense to one class but it may be used as to give 
it a different meaning every time it is employed hence it would very pro 
perly be called egyivocol when two objects bear a certain resemblance to 
each other they are often similarly named thus a crop of com and a crop 
of bayonets have a certain resemblance to each other and are therefore 
said to be analogous 



ok logic 



 real distuictions — terms in which a real distinction obtains have 
been arranged by logicians into the following classes — 

 singular and common terms 

 absolute relative and correlative ierms 

 opposite and compatible terms 

 abstract concrete and collective terms 

 connotative or attributive and nonconnotative or non 

attributive terms 

 positive negative and privative terms 

 definite and indefinite terms 

 contradictory and contrary terms 

 categorimatic and suncategorimatic terms 
 mixed and infinitive terms 

 singular and common terms — a singular term stands for a single 
individual as caesar the thames these it is plain cannot be said 
affirmatively of anything but those individuals respctively a common 
term stands for an indefinite number of individuals or singular terms 
which are called its significates and can be applied to any of tliem as com 
prehending them in its single signification as many river tree 

 absolute relativey and correlative — an absolute term is a term 
which is viewed as a wlhou without reference to anything of which it is a 
part or with which it may be connected as a livmg creature a 
human being a relative term expresses an object considered as part 
of a whole viewed in reference to that complex idea correlative terms 
denote objects related to each other and viewed in that relation professor 
and student master and servant are relative terms being regarded each 
as a part of the complex objects professor and student master and servant 
but when terms are viewed under a correlative aspect they are not only 
viewed as to what that relation denotes but in reference to that relation 
itself thus take the terms king subject servant 

king servant not correlative as such 

king subject correlative 

between king and servant there is no direct relation as such but be 
it observed the king may be viewed under three aspects — 

 king — subject 

 master il f servant 

 man — man 

it will thus be seen that there is no direct relation between servant and 
king but simply an indirect one the direct one being from servant to 
master the indirect one through the master to the king relatives how 
ever are only opposite when applied to the same subject as one may be 
both master and servant but not at the same time to the same person 

 opposite and compatible terms — terms are said to be opposite when 
there are two views which cannot be taken of one single object at the 
same time as for example a piece of paper could be black and white at 
the same time but it may be white and stovi or white and bad hence they 
are caued compatible 

 abstract concrete and collective terms — an abstract term expresses 
an idea or notion without any reference to the subject with which it is 
connected when conjoined with the object that occasioned the idea it 
is then called concrete collective army names of multitude c 




 elelfbntaut treatise 

 abstract goodness vice folly 

 concrete good viscious foo or foolish 

 connotative or attributive nonconnotative or non attributive — 

when a noun is used so as to bring some prominent attribute of it before 
the mind at the same time it is said to be connotative for example 

nonconnotaxrve connotative 

bacon the father of liductive philosophy 

aristotle the father of logic 

romulus the ibumfer of rome 

brewster the inventor of the kaleidescope 

london the capital of england 

here as father of inductive philosophy you connote bacon a certain 
attribute not mvolved in the bare term bacon itself and so with the rest 
it may be further observed that every concrete oomrrum term is connotative 
both in the adjective and substantive forms but not so with the abstract 
common term unless when some quality or condition is implied in the 
term such as heroism which may be considered as implying hope of mind 
or renown 

substantive adjective 

connotative do nonconnotative 

man human human nature 

saint holy holiness 

triangle triangular triangularity 

 positive negative and privative — a jerm expressing a certain view 
of an object as being actually taken of it is called positive as a • man 
walking a term denoting that this view might concurrently be taken of it 
but is not is privative as dmnbness a man dumb a term which 
denotes that such a notion is not and could not be taken of it is called 
negative as a dumb statue a lifeless carcase 

 definite and indefiyiite tenns — a privative or negative term is 
called iiidejimte in respect to its not defining or marking out an object the 
positive being called definite because it defines or marks out the object 
 caesar is called definite not caesar is called indefinite 

 contradictory and contrary terms — the most perfect opposition 
between terms exists between any two when the particle not is attached 
to it for instance inanimate not inanimate incorporeal 
 not incorporeak it is impossible for both these views to be taken 
at once of the same thing it is also impossible but that one or other 
should be applicable to any object for as there is nothing can be both 
so there is nothing can be neither on the other hand contrary terms 
those coming under one class are the most different that belong to that 
class such as wise and foolish proud and humble those 
denoting mental habits are opposed but in a different manner for though 
both cannot be applied to the same object there may be other objects to 
which neither can be applied 

 categorimatic and suncategorimatic terms — the first is one that 
can enter into predication by itself adverbs propositions c also 
nouns in the oblique cases are suncategorimatic ie can only form part 
of a term 

 mixed and infinitive — a verb except the verb to he is a mixed 
word being resolvable hito copula and predicate vik is very often so 



on logic o 

resolved in translating from one langtiage to another as ipse adest lie is 
present but even the substantive verb to be itself can at times be so

troes we are trojans no longer the infimlivey it may be observed 
is never the predicate except when an infinitive is the subject not to 
advance is to fall back not to be for us is to be against us 

n classification 

under this head have been comprehended what have been usually called 
the ten categories or predicaments and the five predicables the 
former were given as a complete enumeration of every thing that could be 
expressed without composition and structure and were intended to include 
all possible objects of thought knowledge and discourse each category 
was considered to be a summum genus of the most extensive generalization 
that can be drawn there being according to aristotle ten such in nature 
these objects of thought were again subdivided into five classes accord 
ing to their extension so that any object of thought might be traced up 
through these five classes or predicables until it was ultimately referred to 
its summum genus which as a matter of course was one or other of the 
ten categories each step in the ladder of extension becoming more 
extended or embracing more objects as a class within its bounds so that 
an object of thought would consequently loose at each step some of the 
peculiarities by which it was ranked in the less extended grades on the 
basis of which it could only be merged in the higher or more extended 
hence the distinction between extension and comprehension the less the 
extension the greater the comprehension for in ascending the ladder of 
extension you select a more general property of the object of thought than 
in the preceding in which to rank it as a class thus take for instance 
the word animal the generalized thought which this term represents is 
that of vitality hence all vitalized objects may be considered as ranking 
under it but if we take the term man all living creatures do not come 
within this term or stand for all its significates but for the human species 
only let us illustrate this by the categories of substance and quantity — 

the ten categoeies or summa genera 

situation relation quality substance place time quantity possession 
action suffering 

 genus animal square 

 species man parallelogram 

 diffirentia rationality all sides equal 

i square on diagonal 

 proprium o progressive improvement equal to square 

 on one side 

 accident separable f born in london c first taught by the 

or inseparable wearing white clothes greeks c 

the student may trace any nameajble thing up to one or other of these 
categories through the predicables as above 

li this way the student may trace up all objects of thought to a 
summum genus or category but this does not explain all a genus may 
be again considered as 

a proximum genus or a subaltern genus 

but this we shall illustrate hereafter let us for the present examine the 
categories a little further

some logicians resolve them all into substance and attribute but it 
is evident that such a classification would not be adequate and at the same 
time would be too vague and indefinite for any practical purposes how 
ever it is quite clear that the above classification is far from being perfect 
that for instance could not be a very comprehensive view of reuxtum 
which would exclude action and local situation from that category

the predicables 

a precucable is a term whicli can be affirmed of several others it is 
evident however that whatever is affirmed of another must express some 
relation to that object it either points out its whole essence which is 
called its species or the material part of which is called its oenus or 
its distinguishing characteristic which is called its diffirentia or some 
tliing joined to its essence either separable or inseparable which is called 
its property or accident this has given rise to tne doctrine of the five 
umversala or predicables to wit — 

 genus proprium 

 species accidens 
 diffirentia 

several oher classifications have been attempted yet the predicables 
have maintained their position to the present time 

looke hume 

 indentity or simularity resemblance 

 relation identity 

 coexistence relation of time h space 

 real existence relation of quantity and number 

 degrees of quality 

 contrariety 
• causation 

lockes enumeration contains none of the ancient predicables nor does 
that of humes with two of lockes left out locke who declaimed so 
much against the aristotelian logicj made but a very lame attempt to re 
construct what he so strenuously endeavoured to destroy his classifica 
tion is of no practical value and is not worth consideration let us now 
examine more closely what is called the predicables it will be as well to 
observe here that the distinction which obtains among the predicables is 
not based upon a differeice in their meaning that is in the attribute which 
they connote but in the class which they denote they may be divided 
into two classes — 

l the substantive the adjective 

this will be illustrated in a subsequent table 

 oenus is the highest or most universal class comprehending under it 
two or more species thus man c are included under the genus animal 

 species is a class comprehended under a higher class and is com 
posed of individuals 

 diffirentia is that which distinguishes one species from another or 
is characteristic to the species but not to the genus 

 proprium is some property peculiar to a species and belongs to the 
whole of it but not its distinguishing characteristic they are divided 



 elementary treatise 

under two heads universal but not peculiar such as to breath air is 
not peculiar to man but to be a poet is though this might perhaps be 
more properly termed an accident 

 accident is an attribute or condition which may or may not be 
absent without destroying the nature of a species hot or cold 
 rich or poor frenchman or scotchman are all accidents 
they are either separable or inseparable clothed in black is a separable 
accident a native of england is inseparable 



the whole essence 
of its subject 
ie the species 



every predicable denotes either 



or part of its essence 



i 

or something joined 
to its essence 



i genus— diffirentia 



property 



accident 



universal but peculiar but uniyersal and i 

not peculiar not universal peculiar 

inseparable— separable 

the genus together with the diffirentia make up the species thus the 
genus animal together with the diffirentia rationality makes up the 
species man though we apprehend the true definition of man to be the 
only being that has the idea of god

a genus may be either a sumimum or subauem genus it is the former 
when it has no genus above it thus a substance is a awmmium genu 
because it is not a species of a higher genus a subaltern genus is both 
a species of a higher genus and a genus in reference to the roecies into 
which it may be divided thus animal is a subaltern genus m reference 
to the higher genus substance and at the same time it is a genus of 
 man bird and every other species of hving creatures that genus 
which is the nearest that can be predicated of a species is called its 
proximum genus thus juice is the proximum genus of wine liquid 
being its more remote genus a species which cannot be considered a 
genus because including no other species is called an infima species 

as was before observed and as will now appear more evident some of 
these predicables are more universal than others this has given rise to 
what is taught in logic respecting the extension and the comprehension of a 
term by the former is meant the number of individuals of which the 
term may be predicated the latter signifies all the simple ideas which 
united constitute what the term denotes the term animal has a 
greater extension than man because it can be predicated of man 
 beast bird and all living creatures but man is more com 
prehensive than animal because it includes not only the attribute of 
 animality but all that belongs to the rational animal man 

in the same way the name of an individual is more comprehensive 
than a term denoting a species but at the same time its extension is 
obviously less caesar can only be predicated of an individual but it 
includes besides the common attributes of humanity all that is peculiar to 
the individual himself hence it is clear that the greater the extension 
of a term the less its comprehension and vice versa 

in division 

division as applied to logic is a metaphorical expression signifying the 
separate enumeration of several things by one common term it is of the 
utmost importance to remember that logical and physical divisions are 
founded upon principles fundamentally distinct a tree may be divided 
into root trunk branches and leaves so that each of these members 
must be less than the whole tree but in a logical division the element 
of extension and comprehension comes into play which constitutes the 
fundamental distinction in question take for example the genus tree 
it may be logically divided into oaky elnhy ash c and does not 
imply the destruction of organization in a logical division the whole is 
distributed into its several parts and those divisible parts consist of genera 
and species the genus is distributed into its species the species into its 
individuals but an individual itself is incapable of logical division because 
it is simply one object be it observed therefore a logical division pro 
ceeds upon the principle of the predicables and not upon a physical prin 
ciple in order to aid us in such divisions the following rules have been 
laid down — 

 each of the parts or any nunber of them short of ally must have a 
narrower signification than the thing divided — thus the genus mineral 
may be divided into the species stones metals c the species 
 metal again into gold silver c because of each of these or 
any number of them short of all contains less than the thing divided 

 all things together must contain nether mare nor less than the whole 



ok logic 

thus medicine has been divided into the means of preserving 
health and tlie means of restoring health because there is no other 
kintl except these two it may be said that there are medicines also 
 for destroying health but then they are not medicinea but poiaon 
every thing of which we have a conception must be either animate or 
inanimate li this way a twofold division may be made of any 
subject so as to extend iu to divide minerals into stones and 
 metals would be an imperfect division because these parts together do 
not make up the whole under this rule may be given what is called 
porphiys tree

in this way the division might be carried on to any length 

 itis parts must be opposed not contained m each otair— if book 
were divided into poetical historical folio quarto french 
 latin these pomts would be contained not opposed to each other 
because a poetical book might be a folio a quarto french and a histo 
rical book latin or again if a division of anmcds were made into men 
bipeds quadrupeds horses asses and ponies the parts would be contained 
in each other m like manner but men may be divided into rich and 
 poor • good and bad young and old because the paxti are 
opposed to each other 



 zlcmsmiaby treatie 

 the fuuural order shom he observecl in arranging the several 
fnemberi hus animal may be divided into man beast bird 
 fish insect but if we were to arrange them into inaecty man bird 
beast the enumeration would be faulty because the natural order of 
things would not be observed 

 when a subject can be divided in several ways toe should select the 
one best adapted for our purpose — thus mankind may be divided 
poutically physiologically geographically or theologically 

 politically lawyer merchant tradesman 

 physiologically wlute negro mulatto 

 geographically european african american 

 theologically christian or pagan heathen or mahometan 

we must therefore determine at first which will best suit our purpose 

ill definition 

the term definition literally signifies to lay down a boundary and 
has been primarily applied to the separation of objects in nature from 
this it has been borrowed and adopted into the field of science and 
literature by a logical definition it is not to be supposed that we are to 
obtain a perfect conception of the thing defined it is simply intended 
as a fine of demarkation to prevent a term being used in two di£perent 
senses in a process of reasoning definitions may be divided under two 
heads — 

i nominal — grammatical or etymological 
il real — def proper 

 essential a physical or natural b logical or metaphysical 
 accidental mixed 

aristotle has defined a definition to be a certain notification of an 
essence but without waiting to examine this nice point for the present 
a definition may be considered a proposition declaring the meaning of the 
word or thing defined 

l nominal definition — this has been called the definition of the name 
as it merely explains the meaning of a word that is not clearly understood 
such as decalogue the ten commandments a triangle that 
which has three angles 

n real definitions — 

 an essential defiidtion — this has been called by logicians the 
definition of the thing a it explains a thing by pointing out its essential 
attributes thus a square is a figure which has four equal sides and 
four right angles 

a the physical or natural definition proceeds upon the principle of the 
parts going to make up the whole — as watch consisting of balance 
darrel spring spiral chain fusee c c 

i a logical definition is made up of the genus and diffirentia of the 
thing defined as wine is the juice of the grape man is a rational 
animal 



on logic 

 accidental definition — by this is meant a description or as it is 
sometimes called an imperfect dednition wliich is merely an enumeration 
of the accidental properties or conditions belonging to the object which we 
wish to define such as a landscape may be described as containing 
cornfields and meadows hills and dales brooks and lakes villages 
houses c all situated in such a manner as to distinguish it from 
other landscapes 

in this way alone individuals can be defined we must enumerate the 
accidents which distinguish one individual from another and add the 
species and then they are accurately defined thus philip was a man of 
macedon who subdued greece 

the principle rules for definition are the following — 

 a definition must he adequate by this is meant that it must 
neither be too extensive nor too narrow for the thing defined thus if 
 bird were defined an animal that flies this would in one sense be too 
extensive because it is applicable to insects c when a definition is 
adequate it may be converted such as the juice of the grape is wine 
 wine is the juice of the grape 

 a definition must be clearer than the thing defined — it must be 
expressed in language as plain and simple as the subject will allow and at 
the same time it must present it more clearly and under a more definite 
aspect to the mind 

 it should he expressed in as few appropriate words as possibletoo 
much brevity must not be used and prolixity must be guarded against 
obscure equivocal and vague terms should not be used neither should 
figurative language be indulged in but in a description figurative 
language may be employed

part ii— propositions 



 a proposition is a judgment repressed in loordslt has been defined 
logically as a sentence indicative that is a sentence affinning or 
denying seritence being the genusy indicative the dijirentia a proposition 
consists of three parts expressed or understood the subject the 
 copula and the predicate the subject is that concerning which 
something is affirmed or denied the predicate is that which is affirmed or 
denied of the subject and the copula is some part of the substantive 
verb to be expressed or understood connecting the subject and 
predicate which are sometimes called the extremes of a proposition 

proposition 
i the subject stands first in the following propositions — 



sub cop pred 

 time is precious 

 csesar was a tyrant 



sub cop pred 

 he is absent 

 not to advance is to fall back 



ii the subject however does not always stand first as in the follow 
ing propositions which may be considered as stated rhetorically or the 
form in which to produce the most effect 



pred cop sub 

 great is diana of the ephe 

sians 

 great is the work of life 



pred cop sub 

 immense was the sensation pro 

duced 

 short will be his career 



in but neither does the subject nor predicate always stand first as 
will be seen from the following — 



cop pred sub 

 it is criminal to put a man 

to death 

 it is impossible to stand such 
insults 



cop pred sub 

 it is glorious to die for ones 

country 

 it is proper to study logic 



iv the copula is sometimes suppressed altogether 



pred sub 
 i hope to succeed is not 
expressed 
to succeed is what i hope 



pred sub 
 i trust in christ only 

christ only is he in whom i 
trust 



v propositions are sometimes expressed in one or two words his 
is particularly the case in latin 



vivo 
amo 



sub pred 
ego vivo 
ego amo 



sub cop pred 
ego sum vivens 
ego sum amans 



 sliemlsniabt treatise 

the above will serve to illustrate what a proposition is but it will be 
as well to observe that questions or commands arc not considered as propo 
sitions such as up guards and at them or choose this day between 
god and ball ihe next thing to be considered is the various aspects 
under which a proposition may be viewed propositions may be viewed 
under three aspects 

i as to substance or nature ii as to quality 

iii as to quantity 

 as to substance or nature propositions considered merely as 
sentences are either categorical or hypothetical 

 categorical propostionsk proposition is categorical when the 
sentence is expressed in an absolute or unconditional form as caesar 
deserved death croesus was rich all men are mortal 

 hypothetical projotow— propositions of this nature are ex 
pressed under a condition or hypothesis as if caisar was a tyrant he 
deserved death 

as to form categorical propositions are considered either tird or modal 
they are pure when they express merely the agreement or disagreement 
between the subject and the predicate as caesar was killed they are 
modal when the proposition includes also the mode or manner in which 
the predicate is connected with the subject as caesar was killed justly 
 smoking is injurious to health is pure but smoking is probably 
injurious to health is modal 

hypothetical propositions are either conjunctive or disjunctive the 
difference between them is that the former is expressed by if and such 
like while the latter is expressed by either and or 

ii as to quality — propositions must be affirmative or negative 
they are affirmative when the predicate agrees with the subject thus 
 man is mortal they are negative when the subject and predicate do 
not agree thus man is not a tree it may be observed that aristotle 
introduces another quality here he considered them as to their matter 
as to their matter it is the connexion between the extremes propositions 
are either impossible or possible necessary or contingent true or false 

when the terms on which a proposition is expressed agree with the 
things signified the proposition is true when they do not agree it is 
 false hence propositions must not be ambiguous for then it has 
more than one meanmg and in reality not one proposition but many 
 impossible is when the two extremes constantly disagree thus a bird is 
not a man necessarywhen the two terms must agree thus birds 
have wings contingent matter is when the terms may or may not 
agree j thus food is necessary to life animals are not quadrupeds 

iii as to quantity f propositions are considered either universal 
general particular or indejinitea proposition is considered universal 
when the predicate is affirmed or denied of the whole of the subject so 
likewise in respect to a general proposition the difference being that the 
first refers to genera and the latter to species thus all animals are 
mortal is a universal all men are mortal a general proposition when 
it is affirmed or denied of a part of it only it is particular some 
men are just some islands are fertile are particular proppsitions 
generals and universals are denoted by the words all none 



on looio 

 every and particularly some many a few c an tnrftf 
jinite proposition is one in which the subject is a common term without 
any of the universal or particular signs expressed with it here the quan 
tity is determined by the matter u the matter be necessary or impos 
sible the proposition is considered as universal in ccmtingent 
matter the proposition is particular 

another class of propositions is that denominated singular those 
whose subject is either a proper name or a common term with a singular 
sign are thus called they are considered univenalsf because in them 
we speak of the whole of the subject if however any qualifying term is 
not inserted to indicate that the whole of the subject is not to be mduded 
the proposition may be viewed as particular 

the four letters a e i o are used to signify four different kinds of 
proportions thus — 



a universal affirmative 



i particular affirmative 



£• universal negative particular negative 

a includes i e includes o 

we have already spoken of the distribution of the subject being in 
every universal but never in a particular but the distribution of the 
predicate depends on the quality not the quantity of the propo 
sition 

the rules here to be observed are 

 all universals but no particulars distribute the subject t e use the 
subject in the whole of its extension as man is mortal man here stands 
lor all men and mortal being more extensive than man it distributes the 
subject man that is makes it stand for all its significates 

 all negatives but no affirmatives distribute the predicate 

 hatever is universally predicated respecting any term distributed 
may be equally predicated of any thing contained under that term 

affeotionb or pofobitionb 

 subalternation conversion opposition 

the affections are the relations of propositions being that pro 
perty by which they undergo various mutual changes propositions 
be it remembered are universal or particular according to quantity 
affirmative or negative as to quality and that the are denoted a 
univeisal affirmative £ universal negative i particular affirmative 
and o particular negative 



a every vine is a tree 
e no vine is a tree 



i some vine is a tree 
o some vine is not a tree 



in reference to negatives in logic a negative proposition never 
implies that the contrary is affirmed 

particular denial does not imply the denial of what is not included 

in it 

c 



 elbuentasy treatise 



i subalternatiok 



subalternation is the substitution of a particular proposition for a 
universal when they agree in quality thus — 

e no tyrants are happy 

o some tyrants are not happy 



a all men are mortal 
i some men are mortal 



in subalternation the universal proposition is called the subaltemans 
and the particular which is substiiuted for it is called the subalterna 
in this case the propositions differ in their quantity alone and the 
maxims laid down in reference to propositions of this manner are — 

 that the truth of the particular proposition is contained in the 
truth of the universal 

 the falsity of the particular in the falsity of the universal 

 whether universal or particular they may be either both tru 
or alse or the one true and the other false 

 convebsion 

the conversion of propositions is the transposing of their terms 
so that the subject is made the predicate and the predicate the sub 
ject thus — 

solomon was the wisest man the wisest man was solomon 

when nothing more is done this is called simple conversion 
but no conversion takes place unless if be illative or legitimate 
that is except the truth of the one is implied in the truth of the other 
or as it is expressed the truth of the converse is implied in the truth 
of the original or exposita we are not to suppose illative is used 
in reference to a process of reasoning it is in fact only modifying 
a proposition or stating the same judgment in another form illative 
conversion can only take place when no term is distributed in the 
converse which was undistributed in the exposita hence since 
e distributes both terms and i neither these may both be illatively 
converted but as a does not distribute the predicate it cannot be 
illatively converted simply 

all men are animals but we cannot say all animals are men as there 
would be a term distributed in the converse which is not distributed in 
the exposita we must therefore limit its quantity from universal to 
particular and the conversion will then be illative this is called con 
version per accidens e may be thus converted but in o whether the 
quantity be changed or no there will still be a term predicate of the 
converse distributed which was not before you can therefore only 
convert it illatively by changing the quality i considering the 
negative as attached to the predicate instead of being attached to the 
copula and thus regarding it as i one of the terms will not then be 
the same but will be equipollent this may be called conversion by 
negation or contraposition thus in one of these ways every proposi 
tion may be illatively converted — 

e i simply a o by negation a e by limitation 



on logic 

 simple conversiox 

e no virtuous mau is a rebel no rebel is a virtuous man 
i some boasters are cowards some cowards are boasters 

 contehsion by negatin 

a every poet is a man of genius he who is not a man of genius 
is not a poet 

 some who possess wealth are not happy some who are not 

happy possess wealth 

 conversion by limitation 

a all birds are animals some animals are birds 

e no man is perfect something that is not perfect is man 

iii opposition 

two propositions are said to be opposed to each other when having 
the same subject and predicate they differ in quantity or in quality or 
in botji there are four different kinds of opposition 

 the two universals a and e are called contraries 

 the two particulars i and o are called subcontraries 

 a and i or e and o subalterns 

 a and o or e and i contradictories 

in necessary matter it is to be observed that all affirmatives are true 
and negatives false in impossible matter vice versa in contingent 
matter all universals false and particulars true 

examples 

 in necessary matter it is to be observed that all affirmatives are 
true and negatives false 

all islands are surrounded by water — true 
some islands are surrounded by water — true 
no islands or some are not — false 

 in impossible matter all negatives are true and affirmatives 
false 

 

all birds are men — false 
some birds are men — false 
no birds are men kc — true 

 in contingent matter all universals are false and particulars true 

all islands are fertile — false 

no islands are fertile — false 

some islands are fertile — true 

some islands are not fertile — true 

here it will be evident that contraries will be both alse in contin 
gent matter but never both true subcontraries both rue in contingent 
matter but never both false contradictories always one true and the 
other yafy c

i— r eflective logic 



metaphysics of logic 



it is of the utmost importance to the logician to hare a clear percep 
on of the nature and sources of human knowledge so far as they 
aare connected with the reasoning science it is also of no small im 
portance to be well acquainted with the first or fundamental principles 
of truth though the consideration of these points does not form 
a direct or integral part of logic that logicians however have 
practically recognised the importance of what we are about to con 
sider is evident from the fact that they have invariably given a long 
list of fallacies c to guard the judgment against error as bearing 
indirectly upon the science in question and this too notwithstanding 
their peculiar opinions respecting the legitimate province of logic in 
addition to what they have done in a negative and indirect form i 
purpose also doing under a positive and direct aspect this i shall 
briefly do under the five following heads — 

 the sources of human knowledge 

 the nature of human knowledge 

 the relation between the subjective powers of man and objective 

relations 

 the various modes in which human knowledge is acquired 

 some of the first principles of human knowledge 

in accordance with this plan we are to consider— 

 the sources of human knowledpeas it would be impossible 
to enter into the full consideration of the various hypotheses advanced 
in respect to human knowledge i shall simply mention them without 
making any observations as to their respective merits one hypo 
thesis that of descartes is that human knowledge is to be ultimately 
traced to certain innate ideas of the mind a second that of hobbs 
is that which traces it to sensation 

he to the senses would all knowledge trace 
and every vestige of a soul deface 
throughout all nature could he but natter find 
the brain and nervous system were his mind 



 elementilby tbeatise 

a third that ot locke to sensation and reflection a fourth to sen 
sation reflectiony and intuition i do not see the propriety of 
considering reflection a fundamental source of human knowledge for 
the very term reflection presupposes prior knowledge it implies 
not only a cognising power to reflect but knowledge to reflect 
upon and according to lockes theory must evidently be based upon 
sensation the same is true also in regard to experience the 
empirical capacities imply not only cognizing powers but likewise a 
prior knowledge of subjective existence when i first smel a rose 
or eat an apple i afterwards say that i have experienced these sen 
sations and to the whole aggregate of my past s msations i give the 
name experience my first consciousness cognitions c are intuitive 
and when the subjective mind becomes cognizant of these states of 
consciousness along with my perceptions of an external universe and 
i proceed to examine them i give to the aggregate of these concep 
tions the name of reflection but it is evident that the conscious 
mind existed as a cognizing power prior to either consciousness 
evidently therefore is at the foundation of all human knowledge and 
sensation and intuition are the mere primary sources by which the 
conscious mind developes its latent powers the latter being the sub 
jective or direct the former being the objective or indirect source 
i confess that i do not like the term intuitive as applied to the 
subjective source because the objective source is just as intuitive 
in its nature as the subjective source itself the term intuition 
therefore properly refers not to the nature of the cognizing power 
itself but to the mode of its cognition i should therefore prefer 
to base the foundation of human knowledge upon — 

 primary sources 

intuitive or f subjective consciousness direct 
immediate sensational consciousness indirect 

 secondary sources 

mediate reflection experience 
 observation 

the senses are the media of sensational or empirical knowledge 
the mental perceptions of which are the conditions upon which the 
judgment perceives fresh relations but it is to be observed that con 
sciousness as such is not to be considered a cognizing power but sim 
ply a universal condition of all intelligence the judgment undoubtedly 
being its primary power and as such may be viewed under two aspects 

 primary judgment the judgment primary judgments 

 subordinate judgment the reason reflections 

it is not to be supposed that the judgment and the reason are two 
distinct powers they are one and the same primary power the above 
distinction being based not upon the subjective power itself but upon 
its mode of develbpment under its primary aspect the judgment 
grasps certain principles in virtue of the constitutional laws super 
seded upon the mind by god under its secondary aspect the 
judgment receives an objective development from external nature 



os looio 

and under that aspect this power may very properly be called the 
reason as to personal identity it is generally supposed to spring 
from consciousness and memory there is i think another element to 
be taken into consideration that of intuition personal identity is 
an intuitive belief strengthened by the intuitive capacity of memory 
that i and no other person filled a certain sphere of relative existenee 
the ultimate sources of human knowledge therefore are — 

 subjective consciousness intuitions 

 objective consciousness sensations 

but granting that these are the fundamental sources of human know 
ledge the question arises is the knowledge cognized by these sources 
relative or absolute 

 the nature of human knowledge — is human knowledge relative 
or is it absolute has been the great question upon which german 
philosophy merged into transcondentaiism this question may be 
viewed under two aspects 

 is human knowledge relative or absolute in its own nature 

 is it relatively or absolutely perceived by the mind 

the principles of truth i apprehend to be both relative and absolute 
subjective and objective all the principles of which are in conformity 
to the divine mind 

 subjective truth kssence and relations j 
 objective truth essence and relations f 
 absolute truth relations principles 

 relative truth relations j 

divine mimd 

subjective truths are those connected with mind and its operations 
objective truths are those connected with mattei and its phenomena 
relative truths have no objective existence when the laws and con 
ditions that occasion them are withdrawn thus supposing the laws of 
nature are withdrawn the truths connected with them would fade out 
of being and could have no further existence than the mere obstract 
conception of them in the divine mind but not so with absolute 
truths they are and ever will be parallel with absolute intelligence 
itself but the other grand question connected with this point is 
the mode or manner by which the mind perceives it is the perception 
relative or absolute 

 the relation between the subjective powers of man and objective 
existence — it has been already observed that all truth is the aggregate 
of those relations in accordance with the divine mind the question 
now is does the human mind perceive the constituted relation of 
these truths as the divine mind does or has each mind a perception 
of them peculiar to itself thus do all minds perceive that and 
make and nothing else and is this the deitys own cunception of 
it i think that all alike have this perception and that deity himself 
has a similar perception we know that these truths enunciated 
are alike and if language be the outward embodiment of thought 
then these perceptions must be alike also but it is to be observed 



 elebcentaby lesatibb 

that these are sabjective pereeptions and specially lelatinp to the judg 
ment and it is wonderful that thea conceptions of which we haye 
an absolute idea as if to show man his finite nature should have 
indefinite bounds but then have we the same absolute idea of ob 
jective perceptions here i see before me a piece of paper which i 
call while but what i see while does another see black for though 
we may similarly name these perceptions they may it is said in 
reality be different at all events we cannot prove that they are not 
but though i cannot perceive through another mans senses the nature 
of his perceptions i have a conscious belief that we both see alike a 
belief as special and primitive as my nature itself and no other sup 
position has a constitutioital adaptation to my cognizing powers than 
that such is the case i may suppose the contrary but cannot be 
lieve it and if my primaiy and constituted convictions are wrong all 
that i can say is that they have been wrongly constituted but may 
not this belief it is said be the result of experience i believe that 
experience occasions and expands the range of this belief but if it be 
the result of it i have never yet found experience of this nature deceive 
me my senses never gave me wrong information and if it has been 
wrong in any case it may be wrong in every case so that con 
sequently all the inductive sciences may be thrown overboard 
kant says that we cannot prove human knowledge to be absolute 
and that we must consequently consider it as relalive i apprehend 
the foregoing considerations must show the absurdity of such a sup 
position for if what kant says be true there is no alternative but 
the nihilism of hume it is absolute knowledge or nihilism and 
here it may be observed that the whole transcendentalism of german 
metaphysics with all its boasted originality is but a magnificent 
plagiarism of david humes speculations for what are the transcen 
dental nostrums of fichle but the ideas and impressiotis of the scotch 
philosopher kant saw humes subtile reasoning in respect to cause 
and effect as well as held and was at issue with reid in respect to 
the foundations of human knowledge but then he maintained that 
it was relalive reid that it was absolute from this starting point 
of relalive knowledge the transcendental coach of german philo 
sophy started a new phraseology was put into the mouth of the guards 
but they travelled by the same rail and ended at the same terminus 
at which the immortal hume with less ostentation but with far more 
ingenuity and power of thought landed years previously 

 the different modes by which human knowledge is acquired 
there are two ways in which human knowledge is acquured one 
by alternate succession of causes and effects that they all ultimately 
hang upon one primary and fundamental cause i have attempted to 
prove in another place the connexion between cause and effect it 
may be observed is not so much a disputed point as to what the nature 
of our idea of it is some philosophers contend that we merely have the 
bare idea of antecedence and consequence others that there is a power 
in the cause adequate to the production of the effect i apprehend 
that this difference of opinion arises from a fale or restricted concep 
tion the idea is evidently complex and may be viewed under two 
aspects— 

 as involving a power to produce the effect 

 as antecedence and consequence 



oir logto 

the illttsttfttions of those philosophers who adopt the latter opinion 
are invariably taken from the phenomena of inorganic matter in as 
much as illustrations of this nature are more favorable to their peculiar 
opinions but if we take our illustrations from mind or a principle of 
activity the tables ate immediately turned cause being power in 
agtion the illustration ought evidently to be taken from a principle of 
activity supposing a man sit down to dinner he himself being the 
cause of eating that dinner i would ask has he not an idea of power 
within himself to do so but then there is another disputed question 
connected with this interesting point did he acquire this idea from 
intuition or fiom experience the capacity of perceiving it is 
cdentiy born with us and experience is merely the occasion of its 
development when an infant sucks its mother for the first time it 
as the cause could not have acquired it 

i a direct way an indirect way 

the first is by consciousness the second by the senses these two 
modes may again be viewed under a fourfold aspect 

 by intuition — consciousness the senses 

 by judgment 

 by induction refiection observation 

 by deduction 

tjnder the head of intuition therefore comes observation and 
experiment the knowledge gained thereby being immediate the 
knowledge acquired otherwise being mediate that is through the 
medium of proof by reflecting judging and reasoning the first 
may be considered as the fouiuiation of all knowledge and of all 
reasoning and it is only with the second that reasoning properly 
commences and logic in reality begins as knowledge however is 
acquired in the four ways abovementioned we may easily see that 
there will be four species of fallacy or sources of error 

 the fallacies of intuition 

 the fallacies of judgment 

 the fallacies of induction 

 the fallacies of deduction 

the consideration of fallacies being an evident method of guarding 
against error they will naturally fall to be considered after we have 
examined the direct method the one being tho ride the other the 
exception before i quit this head i shall briefly consider the nature 
of our idea of oauee and effect being one of the most important points 
within the whole range of mental philosophy because the whole series 
of mental operations and of mental phenomena are but the conscious 
perception that he has the power of doing so however obscure it may 
be from his yet undeveloped capacities but it may be asked when 
the child has burnt his finger for the first time by the candle had he the 
idea f a power in the flame of the candle to produce this sensation i 
apprehend not but it might be asked with the same propriety when 
a man first tasted arsenic did he know before hand that it would 
poison him certainly not to say that the child knew that the 
candle would burn him before it did so would be to say that the 



 blbxxntabt ibvatiss 

cbild knew it before it did know it but this does not make the 
knowledge thus acquired the less intuitive the first sensation was 
instantly perceived for it did not require a prior sensation to make 
the jirst sensation to be perceived these sensations are the occa 
sions of human knowledge the mind itself not coming in tlirect 
contact with the material qualities of external nature but through the 
medium of certain sensational organs having thought much upon 
this question i have come to the conclusion uiat our idea of cause 
and efiect may be viewed under three aspects 

 that of antecedence and consequence that there is a power 
in the cause to produce the effect that in the absence of 
the cause we determine its nature by that of the effect 

 some of the first principles of human knowlege 

i the first principles of kecessart truth

 that design of the intelligence in the cause may be inferred with 
certainty from marks or signs of it in the effect

the logic of judgment 



ob 



rbasonino from pabtictjlabs to particulara 



in affirming or denying one thing of another there is an immediate 
act of judgment this act of judgment expressed in words is csued a 
proposition and when two or more propositions are compared it is 
then a process of the judging power but the doctrine of proposi 
tions as shchy is not peculiar to any department of the reasoning 
science 

a proposition may be one of — 

iituitiou i see john 

judgment thomas is kmd 

induction all men aire mortal 

deduction john is mortal 

but let it be observed that there is a distinction between the 
judging act and the judging process with the judging act logic 
lias strictly speaking nothing to do but only with the judging process 

judging act this candle burnt me therefore 

judging process that candle will burn me 

this process as we have already observed is of a threefold 
nature — 

the judging process 

the inductive process logic 
the deductive process 

in the judging process we proceed from one proposition or act of 
judgment to another proposition or act of judgment in the act of 
judgment we pronounce two ideas to agree or disagree with this act 
of judgment we proceed and apply this already affirmed act to 
another object of a like nature or that the same thing will be true or 
not true of the same thing again in the judging act it will be 
observed then that we commence with two ideas but that in the 
judging process we commence not with a simple idea but with an act 
of judgment e y 

idea ideu 
finger candle agree to burn 



ov loxo 

this candle burnt the fingerict of jadgment uiereforeproce 
of judgentuiat candle will burn the finger 

from what has been said it will appear obvious that in the logic 
of judgment all reasoning is from particulars to particulars t 

john has died therefore 
mary will die 

again 

peter mary and thomas haye died therefore 
the whole family will die 

from one or more particular facts we reason to other particular 
facts without reasoning through the medium of general laws or 
buppowd uniformity of sequences in nature it will appear obvious 
upon a little reflection that the great mass of the ignorant part of 
mankind reason from particulars to particulars and on this score 
they may be put upon a level with children and the inferior animals 
we only rise to generalities as we advance in intelligence when 
the flre burns the child for the first time he infers it wul do so again 
 with the dog if it bums him once he infers it will do so the second 
time or give him a piece of beef with mustard upon it he will 
reason that it will cause him the same unpleasant sensation as before 
the true distinction therefore between the reasoning of men and of 
animals is that 

 animals reason from particulars to particulars only 

 men from particulars generals and universals 

it may be said that the dog reasons upon the principle of asso 
ciation that man does the same so that there is in reality no dis 
tinction between them man associates material qualities just like 
the animal but how can he associate abstractions generalizations or 
first principles they have no corresponding objective existence for 
the purpose of association and to this the animal evidently cannot 
rise and besides it would be impossible for the lower animals to 
rise up to generals universals or the infinite without general signs 
that is without language it is here then where the manifest dis 
tinction between reason and instinct lies — where the former terminates 
and the latter commences 

in reasoning fiom particulars to particulars we are reasoning upon 
the confines of intuitive truth i have really thought very often 
whether what we call acts qf judgment be properly so called and 
whether they be not sensational perceptions expressed in words it 
appears to me that the judgment has really nothing to do with many 
propositions and that instead of considering them acts of judgment 
expressed in words they ought to be considered sensational or 
intuitional perceptions expressed in words thus take the following 
propositions which of course according to the orthodox logic are 
acts of judgment — 

mary stabbed me with a pin james knocked me in the eye 
thomas is drowned waller broke his leg john cut my hand the 
cannon shot frightened me the smell disgusted me the taste was 
nauseous 



 blsmsktly tusatibb 

j would ask how many of these propositions are acts of judgment 
expressed in words it appears to me that they are all intuitive 
truths hased upon sensation and that in reality the judgment has 
nothing to do with them as such let us throw one of them into the 
syllogistic form 

whoever stahs with a pin ought to be punished mary stahbed 
with a pin therefore mary ought to be punished 

supposing our principal logicians were sitting in a parlour 
enjoying a chat with the ladies and that by a previously concerted 
plan some of the mischievous young rascals agreed at the same 
moment of time to try an experiment with their pins upon the nether 
part of these venerable authors i should like to know how many 
would consider such an experiment expressed in tdords an act of 
judgment but i may now be asked where lies the act of judgment i 
i unhesitatingly answer that the act of judgment is the act of com 
parison the process the procedure of inference 

in reasoning from these intuitional propositions we must guard 
against extending the attribute of one object to that of a different 
object thus — 

sugar is sweet therefore sand is sweet 

in this case the only way is to deny the inference or existence of the 
attribute and show intuitionally its fallaciousness

ths term induction is derived from the latin verb tndueo and 
primarily signifies a leading arranging or gathering in of facts it is 
also used in a secondary sense to signify the inducing of the mind to 
believe in the uniformity of sequences that obtains in respect to the laws 
of nature this inductive belief being based upon the uniformity 
that it obtains in respect to the facts of its own experience induction 
in the former sense is synonymous with observation and experiment 
but in that sense has nothing to do with the logic of induction but 
with intuition which we have already examined induction there 
fore properly so called is the inducing of the mind to a generalized 
conclusion in conformity with the uniformity of sequences that obtain 
in the phenomena of nature in order to have generalized conclu 
sions it is necessary to have general terms but it is not to be supposed 
that these general terms represent general substances they merely 
connote some primary attribute or attributes 

test of inductive syllogisms 

 oneact he found to contradict the facts upon which m inductive 
tyllogism ultimately resis the whole argument falu to the ground 

peter james and john are mortal these are men therefore 
all men are mortal 

hence the inference is inductively drawn the mind following the 
law or affirming the attribute that obtains respecting the facts and 
extends it in his belief to all facts of a similar nature it will be 
observed that the inference proceeds upon the basis that the cquise 



d slelcbntabir ifrtatisb 

of nalure is uniform but if one fact be found contradictory of the facts 
upon which the inference is based the whole argument falls to the 
ground 

abistotles syllogism by induction 

man hors and muld sie lenglited 
man horse and mule are void of bile 
the whole class void of bile are longlived 

according to aristole the minor premise must be convertible 

thus — 

man horse mule are longlived 

fman horse mule are void of bile in i j • 

¦ uvoc iuuc €mo ysjlxm vi ic converted minor 

 thmgs void of bile are man horse mule j 
the whole class void of bile are longlived 

i apprehend that aristotle would find few very such inductive syllo 
gisms in nature as would require to enumerate all the facts in the 
minor premise as to the truth of the above inductive syllogism i leave 
professor holloway and the college of physicians to decide it is 
beyond my capacity from che above syllogism i think it is obvious 
that aristotle was not acquainted with what might be termed the 
 baconian syllogism or reasoning from particulars to generals or uni 
versals but there is no wonder at this from the age in which he lived 
and the triumphs which his ereat genius achieved but it is wonderful 
to see with what tenacity his apostolic successors cling to the ortho 
doxy of their great master and how religiously they stick to the 
logical cut of their great logical tailor 

it will be observed that induction implies not only reasoning from 
particulars to generals but also from generals to universals 

sheep oxen deer € ruminate these are different in upper 

cutting teeth c therefore all such ruminate 
again— all men beasts birds insects fishes c have a power of 

beginning motion these are animals therefore all animals have 

a power of beginning motion 

take also the following instances of the inductive syllogism — 

logic metaphysics mathematics music c deserve encourage 
ment these are useful studies therefore all useful studies 
deserve encouragement 

or again — iron steel silver gold c increase in heat in their 
degree of nearness to fire these are substances therefore all sub 
stances will do the same 

again — peter james and paul as witnesses sufferers and martyrs 
of a religion divinely attested ought to be believed these were 
apostles of a religion divinely attested therefore all apostles 
of a religion divinely attested ought to be believed 



on logic 

from these examples c the student will be able to understand 
what we mean by induction it is to be observed that the two 
premises are to be considered as minor premises for there is no mqfor 
premise in an inductive syllogism the object of induction being to 
generalize or to get major premises 

minor premises soeii moses socrates christ c are wrong 
in what they taught these taught moral systems therefore 

conelusionall moral systems are wrong that have been taught 
except of course mr robert owens 

major remm— all moral systems that have been taught are 
wrong the moral system of socrates was taught therefore 
the moral system of socrates is wrong

logic of deduction it will be unnecessary to enter upon it in this 
place— ism introduction

the logic of deduction 



ob 



reasoning from qbnbrals and uniybesals to 
particulabs and generals 



etxry deductive argument when stated at full length or jut into a 
logical form is called a sjuowny which consists of three propositions 
either expressed or understood divided into two parts the means of 
proof and the thing proved 

r all men are mortal means of droof 

propositions j john is a man therefore j 

 john is mortalthe thing proved 

the thing proved before it is proved is called the question 
but after being proved it is called the conclusion when the 
means of proof are stated first they are called premues but if 
stated last the reason the order generally observed in stating a 
syllogism is first to lay down the premises and then draw the 
conclusion 

all tyrants are miserable premises 

csesar was a tyrant therefore f 
csesar was miserable — conclusion 

in every syllogism the propositions are not only confined to three 
in number but the terms are three in number also take for instance 
the following syllogism — 

all men are endowed with reason john is a man therefore john 
is endowed with reason 

the three terms of the above are men endowed with reason 
 john which being syllogistically compared form the three propos 
itions in question 

endowed with reason the major term 

john the minor term 

men the middle term 



on looio 

the migor and minor terms give their respeclive names to the 
premises in which they are compared the proposition in which the 
major term appears is called the major proposition or premise that in 
which the minor terra appears is called the minor premise the major 
and minor terms being in the first place compared with the middle 
term in the premises and then with each other in the conclusion into 
which the middle term never enters it will be as well to observe 
that the term compare as used in logic is like many other metaphys 
ical terms borrowed from the phenomena of matter thus take 
any two objects in nature— two men — two horses— two muskets — 
two ships c and they may be compared in various ways as to size 
strength speed power beauty c but the term as used in logic 
implies that a certain quality attribute or condition is affirmed or 
denied of a certain object and according to the perceptions of the 
judgment is said to agree or disagree with each other thus take 
the following syllogism — 

all men are mortal john is a man therefore john is mortal 

here the attribute of mortality is affirmed of all men in the 
major premise the attributes of humanity affirmed of john in the 
minor ihd then in the conclusion the attribute of mortality is 
affirmed of john singly in the above process men and mortal 
 john and man are said to be compared with each other 

no discontented men are happy some rich men are discontented 
therefore some rich men are not happy 

here discontented men and happy are first compared and 
then rich men and discontented that is in the major premise 
the state of happiness is denied of discontented men in the 
minor premise the state of discontent is affirmed of rich men c 

it will be as well to observe further before we enter upon the strict 
analysis of the syllogism that the logic of deduction takes no cog 
nizance whatever of the truth or falsity of the premises it proceeds 
upon the assumption that the premises are either selfevident or 
granted to be true the question with which the logic of deduction 
has to do is simply whether the said conclusion is legitimately 
drawn from given premises if the premises be true and a false con 
clusion inferred logic detects the error if on the other hand the 
premises are false nevertheless admitted and the conclusion legit 
imately drawn the error is beyond the cognizing range of the deductive 
logic take for instance the following syllogism — 

all men have wings john is a man therefore john has wings 

if these premises be granted the conclusion must be admitted 
the error in the above syllogism is beyond the sphere of the 
deductive logic the detection of which belongs to another depart 
ment of the science already treated of

 slementabt treatise 

a syllogism is that form of reasoning in which every deductiye 
argument can be logically stated it consists of three propositions 
the major minor and the conclusion these propositions again 
consist of three terms the major minor and middle term by 
the comparing of which terms with each other the propositions in 
question are formed — 

middle term major term 
every man has a soul 

minor term middle term 
john is a man therefore 

minor term major term 
john has a soul 

i the syllogistic maxim or aristotles dictum 

dictum de omni et nuuo or whatever is predicated that is afigurmed 
or denied of a term distributed that is used in the whole of its exten 
sion may be predicated in like manner of every thing contained under 
it upon this maxim the validity of every syllogistic argument 
ultimately rests 

ii its axioms 

 if two terms agree with one and the same third they agree with 
each other upon this axiom rests the validity of affirmative con 
clusions 

 if one term agrees and the other disagrees with one and the 
same third they disagree with each other ujpon this axiom rests the 
validity of negative conclusions 

iii lis rules 

 every syllogism has three and only three terms 

 every syllogism has three and only three propositions 

 the middle term must be distributed once at least and must not 
be ambiguous 

 no term must be distributed in the conclusion which was not 
distributed in the premises 

 from negative premises nothing can be inferred 

 if one premise be negative the conclusion must be negative 

 from a general proposition with a specific predicate you can 
only infer a particular or general conclusion 

from the above rules it will appear evident — 

ist that from two particular premises nothing can be inferred 

nd that if one premise be particular the conclusion must be 
particular 

rd a third is added by logicians that we cannot always infer a 
universal conclusion from two universal premises fsee mule 



on looio 



i tfib syllooistio maxim 

whauver is affirmed or denied of a term distributed may he affirmed 
or denied oj anything contained under it 

all men are mortal john is a man therefore john is mortal 

the term men in the major premise is distributed in the above 
syllogism of which mortal is affirmed the term mortal being 
more extensive than the term men consequently distributes that is 
makes it stand for all its significates or in other words the whole of 
humanity in the minor premise the term man is affirmed of 
 john which of course is included as one of the significates of the 
term men in the major premise and in the conclusion the term 
 mortal may accordigly be affirmed of john as one of the signi 
ficates of men the above rule may be ultimately applied to all de 
ductive arguments whose validity ultimately rests on their conformity 
thereto but it cannot be directly applied to all even of pure 
categorical syllogisms for the sake of brevity therefore some other 
axioms are commonly applied in practice to avoid the occasional 
tediousness of reducing all syllogisms to that form in which the 
arstotelian dictum is immediately applicable 



categorical syllogisms 
ii — axioms 

 if two terma agree with one and the same third they agree mth one 
another 

all birds have wings the lark is a bird therefore the lark has wings 

here birds and wings are compared and are said to agree with 
each other ihen the term bird is compared with mark which is 
likewise said to agree so that birds agreeing with wings and lark agreeing 
with birdf hence it will follow that lark and wings will agree 

 one term agrees and another disagrees with one and the same 
third these two disagree with each otjier 

no man is happy before death john is a man therefore john is 
not happy before death 

here man and happy before death are compared in the major 
and are said to disagree with each other so disagreeing in the premises it 
naturally follows that they disagree in the conclusion 

in — bulbs 

 every syllogism has three and only three terms these are the 
middle term the major and minor terms or as they are sometimes called 
the extremes of the conclusion of these the subject of the conclusion is 
called the minor term and the predicate the major term in the premises 



 elbmentaby tbeatie 

the middle term is compared with the major and minor terms and in the 
conclusion the major and minor are compared with each other if there 
fore there were two middle terms the terms of the conclusion not being 
both compared at the same time they could not be conclusively compared 
with each other 

light is contrary to darkness feathers are light therefore feathers are 
contrary to darkness 

in the above syllogism there are virtually two middle terms in sense 
though only one in sound and so in the following — 

white is a colour black is a colour therefore black is white 

here white is compared with one portion of colour and 
 black with another portion of it 

• 

 every syllogism has three and only three propositions st the 
major premise in which the major term is compared with the middle term 
nd the minor premise in which the minor term is comparea with the 
middle term and rd the conclusion in which the minor term is com 
pared ynih the major 

 tjie middle term must he distributed once at least in the premises 
that is it must either be the subject of a universal or the predicate of a 
major proposition 

some animals are beasts some animals are birds therefore some 
birds are beasts 

here animals is not distributed or used in the whole of its extension 
it is quite true that some animals are beasts and it is equally true 
that some animals are birds but then beasts and birds are compared 
with a di£perent part of the significates under the term animal 

 no term must be distributed in the conclusion which was not dis 
tritmted in one of the premises for in that case you would employ the 
whole of a term in the conclusion when you had only employed a part of 
it in the premises and by this means be really introducing a fourth 
term — 

all bipeds are animals a horse is not a biped therefore a horse is 
not an animal 

here the term animal is not distributed in the major premise but 
is distributed in the conclusion 

again whatever is related in the koran is unworthy of credit 

miraculous stories are related in the koran therefore miraculous 
stories are unworthy of credit 

in the above syllogism there is what is termed an illicit process 
of the major term because miraculous stories in the minor is a par 
ticular proposition that is some miraculous c all therefore that 
can be inferred in the conclusion is simply some miraculous stories are 
unworthy of credit 

 from negative premises nothing can be inferred 



on looio 

no man is happy before death no woman is happy before death — 
proves nothmg a lion is not a biped a horse is not a biped— 
proves nothing likewise 

 if one premise he negative the conclusion must be negative for 
the middle term is found to disagree with one of the extremes and in the 
other to agree with the other extreme therefore the extremes disagreeing 
with each other it must be negative 

no man is happy before death john is a man therefore john is not 
happy before death 

 from a general proposition with a specific predicate you can only 
infer a particular or general conclusion 

all gold is precious all gold is a mineral therefore some mineral 
is precious 

inferences deduced from preceding rules 

 huu nothing can he inferred from two particular premises 

some men are sagacious some beasts are sagacious — proves nothing 
some animals are sagacious some beasts are not sagacious there 
fore some beasts are not animals 

 animals is distributed in the conclusion but not in the major pre 
mium there is consequently an illicit process 

 ione of the premises he particular the conclusion muat he particular 

all who fight bravely deserve reward some soldiers fight bravely 
therefore some soldiers deserve reward 

 from two universal premises you cannot always infer a universal 
conclusion see rule 

all gold is precious all gold is a mineral therefore some mineral 
is precious 

these are evidently not universal premises it will be seen that we 
have formerly drawn a distinction between general and universal proposi 
tions a general proposition we have stated to be a proposition of 
which a species is the subject in the major premise of the above 
syllogism gold is a species whereas mineral is a genus so that 
from a species as such and particulary an infirma species you can only 
infer something of the individuals contained under it 

the above syllogism taken from whatelys logic fiilly stated 
would run thus — 

all gold is precious all gold is a mineral therefore all gold or some 
mineral is precious 

the worthy prelate has therefore evidently misapprehended the true 
nature of the above syllogism the following proposition is precisely 
analogous — 

all men are bipeds all men are animals therefore some animals are 
bipeds or all men are bipeds 



 elbcentabt tbeiltise 

the term animals in the conclusion must stand for men alone 
as it sigoificates and cannot include any other species in as much as it 
was only compared with men in the premise the some animals may 
therefore be considered as identical with all men 



n— of moods 

the mood of a syllogism is the legitimate determination of these propo 
sitions in the order in which they stand accoiding to their respective 
quantity and qmuty as indicated by their symbols a e i 

there being four kinds of propositions a e i and three proposi 
tions in each syllogism all the possible ways of arranging them will be 
but this is merely a numerical calculation of their possible modes of combi 
nation without regard to logical rules for it will be found on examination 
that the great majority of these are inadmissible and that all legitimate 
moods are confined to the narrow compass of eleven

n of figures 

categorical sylloaisms 



the figure of a syllogism consists in the situation of the middle term 
the premise or in respect to the major and minor terms 

all the possible moods of a syllogism are four and are designated 
by the figures 



ok logic 

ist jthi fint figure is thai m which the middle term is made the subject 
qftkiwkif and predicate of the minor premise 

nd the second figure is that in which the middle term is the predicate 
of both premises 

rd in the third figure the middle term is the subject of both premises 

th the fourth figure is that in which the middle term is the predicate of 
the major and subject of the minor premises 

ist flgube 

middle term subject of the major predicate of the minor 

middle term 
a every principle of religion promotes human happiness 

middle term 

a benevolence is a principle of reugion therefore 
a benevolence promotes human happiness 

this is the most dear and rational of all the gures because to syllogisms 
in this figure only does the aristotelian dictum at once apply 

nd fioube 

middle term predicate of both premises 

a every virtue is praiseworthy 

e intemperance is not praiseworthy therefore 

e intemperance is not a virtue 

in this figure only negative conclusions can be proved because one 
of the premises must be negative 

rd figure 

middle term the subject of both premises 

a all flowers are beautiful 

i some flowers are roses therefore 

l some roses are beautiful 

none but particular conclusions can be drawn in this figure 

th figure 
middle term predicate of the major svbject of the minor 

every man is an animal every animal is sentient therefore something 
that is sentient is man 

this figure is the most awkward of all though a syllogism stated thus 
if according to rule would certainly be valid it is only however a 
clumsy way of stating what could be more naturally expressed in the first 
figure by transferring the premises and simply converting the conclusion 

thus take the above syllogism — 

every animal is sentient every man is an animal therefore man is 
sentient 



 xlemeirrabt treatise 

by applying the moods to each figure it will be found that each figure 
will admit six moods only as not violating the rules against undistributed 
middle and illicit process but of the moods thus admitted several are 
useless as having a particular conclusion when a universal might be drawn 
of these twentyfour moods five are for this reason neglected so that 
only nineteen remain

it is worthy of remark that i e o which is excluded from all the modal 
figures is the only one of the fiftythree that is excluded because it cannot 
be used in any one of the figures 

m modal figures 

it will be observed that out of the sixtyfour possible moodsy eleven 
only can be used in a legitimate term and that even these are not all allow 
abk in the same figure some being used in one and some in another it 
win be also observed that of the twentyfour legitimate modal figures 
ninetai only are vahd and useful to distinguish these moods and the 
figoras in which they are found and also to faciutate their reduction names 
have been devised and embodied in the following mnemonic lines which 
the student ought to commit to memory

in order to facilitate the labours of the student we shall give an ex 
ample of each of the above in the following table but it will be as well 
to remind him here that in studying the above table he must not only 
commit it accurately to memory but that he must likewise test the various 
syllogisms in the different moods so as to make himself perfect master of 
the principles upon which it is based he will perceive that a can only 
be found in the first figure in which also every other proposition may be 
found that the second only procures negatives because the middle term 
being predicate in both premises would not be distributed unless one were 
negative the third only particulars 

let us first take one example in each figure

it win he ohserved that this figure only proves negative condusicms 
the reason is ohvious the middle term heing the predicate of both the 
premises would not be distributed unless it were a negative 

it is worthy of remark also that if you wish to establish an objeetitm 
this is the foarm into which most of such arguments will naturally foll 
for exame if any one should argue against the existence of god 
because he does not see him he may be refuted by the argument that 
our thoughts are not seen by us though we nevertheless believe in tlieir 
existence

we wish the student to observe in respect to the above syllogism that 
some logical authors consider the major premise a tiimyrso propositicm 
we omsider it only a general proposition the subject of it bemg a species 
simply we recommend therefore to the intelligent student to study 
particularly the difference between specific and generic subjects as also 
between specific and generic predicates the former being general aflbma 
dons the latter universal affirmations or denials

 elementary treatise 



on the reduction of syllogisms 

the four moods of the first figure barbara celarent darii ferio 
as they are the clearest and most natural are called perfect the moods 
of the other figures are called imperfect in as much as the aristotelian 
dictum cannot be directly and immediately applied to them but as all 
deductive reasoning ultimately depends on this dictum all the moods of 
the other three figures may be brought into some of the four moods of the 
first figure when a syllogism has been thus resolved it is said to be 
reduced from an imperfect to a perfect mood and any argument that 
cannot be so reduced is not considered valid 

li studjdng the process of syllogistic reduction the student should 
thoroughly master that part of lqgic which treats of the affections of 
propositions and particularly that of conversion as it bears an immediate 
relation to the process in question it will be as well to observe that in 
the process of reduction we are not allowed to change termsy or introduce 
new propositions when the premises are laid down and their truth 
granted all that we are permitted to do is simply to connect or transpose 
them so that they may become subject to the laws and conditions of the 
first figure this may be done in two ways 

i by direct reduction ii by indirect reduction 

i direct reduction — in this species of syllogistic reiuction we may 
convert the major or minor premise and if necessary to transpose the 
premises after being so converted and in this way the imperfect mood may 
be reduced to one of the four perfect moods 

thus — 

bramartip of the fourth 

every man is an animal every animal is sentient something that is 
sentient is man 

may be reduced to barbara of the first figure by transposing the pre 
mises the conclusion naturally following according to the form of the first 
figure 

every animal is sentient every man is an animal therefore man is 
sentient 

n indirect reduction 

by this we prove in the first figure not directly that the original 
conclusion is true but that it cannot he false that is that an absurdity 
would follow from the supposition of its being false thus — 

all true patriots are friends to religion 

some great statesmen are not friends to religion 

some great statesmen are not true patriots 

if this conclusion be not true its contradictory must — 

an great statesmen are true patriots 



on logic 

let this proposition then be made the minor of the above syllogism 
and a false conclusion will be proved — 

bar all true patriots are friends to religion 
ha all great statesmen are true patriots 
rot ajl great statesmen are friends to religion 



or 



all truly wise men live virtuously 
some philosophers do not live virtuously 
some philosophera are not truly wise men 



take the contradictory of the above conclusion as your minor premise 

all truly wise men live virtuously 
all philosophers are truly wise men 
all philosophers live virtuously 

this conclusion k the contradictory of the original minor premises and 
must therefore be fietlse because the premises are always supposed to be 
granted if this conclusion be false then it necessarily follows that one 
of the premises from which it has been legitimately derived must be false 
likewise but the major premiaey being one of those originally granted 
must be true the falsity must therefore rest with the minor premise 
but die minor premise bemg the contradictory of the original conclusions 
hence the origmal conclusion must be true this kind of reduction it 
may be ofaaerved is seldom used except for baroho and bokardoy which 
may howater be reduced directly by contraposition thus 

ba all true patriots are friends to religion 

ro some great statesmen are not friends to religion 

ko some great statesmen are not true patriots 

this may be reduced to jpertb by converting the major by negation or 
contraposition 

whoever is not a friend to religion is not a true patriot 
some great statesmen are not mends to religion 
some great statesmen are not true patriots 

so with bokardo which may be reduced to darii convertting the major 
premise by contraposition and then transposing them 

some slaves are not discontented all slaves are wronged therefore 
some who are wronged are not discontented thus — 

all slaves are wronged 

some who arc not discontented are slaves 

some who are not discontented are wronged 

it will be necessary now to explain the use of the mnemonic lines 
barbara celarent dariiy ferio c the initial letters of all the moods 
are b c d f the first letter in every imperfect mood indicates that it 
is to be reduced to that mood of the first figure that begins with the same 
letter thus every mood commencing with b is to be reduced to barbara 
with c to celarent with d to darii with f to ferio besides these 
uiitial letters there arc other consonants in the middle or end of the names 



 xlehemtaby treatise 

of the different moods indicating the kind of reduction that is to be n 
ployed these letters are p m o s p and c refer to the vowels 
immediately preceding them that v to the propositions denoted hy these 
vowels 

 the proposition denoted by the rowta before it to be simply 
converted 

p the proposition denoted by the vowel before it to be converted per 
accidens 

e refers to indirect reduction it shows that the proposition denoted by 
the vowel before it must be left out and the contradictory of the conclusion 
substituted in its place 

m that the premises are to be transposed that is the minor part 
instead of the major and the major instead of the mindr

n — comfodird stixogisiis 

a compound syeogisin is defined to be two or more categoruxds united 
by a eojmla the proposilions of which have been named from their 
respectiye oonjmietions they may however be divided under three 
heads — 

 conjunctive 

 conditional constructive or destructive 

 disjunctive 

f 

l conjtjncnvbs 

in the case of omjunctive sydogisms the condition expessed is attached 
to om of he termsf and not to the premise as such e g 

every enthusiast is either a knave or fool 
loyola was an enthusiast therefore 
loyola was either a knave or a fool 

or 

every statesman is either a patriot or an adventurer 
caniung was a statesman uierefbre 
canning was either a patriot or an advoiturer 

il conditionals 

li the case of the oonditiooals the reasoning rests on an hypothesis the 
major being called the hypothetical the miuot the catorical premise 

if the tories are patriots they deserve the support of the country 

the tories are pots therefore 

the tories deserve the support of the country 

in every conditional syllogism there are what may be called three 
terms — the consequencey arueoedent and consequent their natural 
ord is as follows though that is not of any very material importance as 
we frequently find them reversed 

conseqiience antecedent conseqnent 

if — there is a grod — he ought to be worshipped 

consequent consequence antecedent 

the french are a wonderfol people — tf — they are happy 

consequence consequent antecedt 

if — he knew his advantages — the young man would be prudent 

in all propositions of this nature if correct in point of form the truth of 
the antecedent must necessarily imply the truth of the consequent for other 
wise the proposition would be frdse and ought not to be admitted into 
argumentation 

if christianity be from grod it ought to be embraced 

in this case the antecedent and consequent are tme in themselves and 



ok logic 

the whole proposition is tirue likewise because there is a real connection 
between them 

if christianity be an imposition it ought to be abandoned 

in this case both the antecedent and consequent ssejalse in themselves 
but the whole proposition is true as the consequent legitimately follows 
from the antecedent i e there is such a connection between them that 
if q admit the one you must admit the other also 

bules fob cinitinal syllogisms 

• if the antecedent is granted the consequent may be inferred 
 if the consequent is denied the antecedent may be denied 

there are two modes of arguing in respect to conditionals the first is 
based upon the admmion or nonadmission of the antecedent by the minor 
premise 

in the first we argue from the admission of the antecedent to the admis 
sion of the consequent 

in the second we argue from the removal of the consequent to the 
rmnoval of the antecedent the first is the constructive the second is the 
destructiife form 

there is another way of arguing which is evidently inadmissible — from 
the admission of the consequent to the admission of the antecedent the 
following rules must therefore be observed in conditional syllogisms •— 

 if the minor affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent the 
condusion toul be valid 

 if the minor affirms the eonsequenf or denies the antecedent nothing 
can be iriferred 

antecedent consequent 

if logic is useful it deserves to be studied 

but logic is usejul therefore constructive 

it deserves to be studied 

in the above syllogism the antecedent is affirmed in the minor premise 
and is accordingly vajid 

if slavery be contrary to the laws of christ it ought to be abolished 
hy entrap to his law therefore constructive 
it ought to be abolished j 

antecedent consequent 

if mormanism be of god it must promote virtue 

but mormanism does not promote virtue therefore destructive 

it is not of god 

the minor denies the consequent 

antecedent gonsequent 

 if the season has been good com must be cheap 
but com is not cheap therefore destractive 

the season has not been good 



 elementart teeatie 

if mormanism be of god it will flourish inadmissible minor 

but mormanism is not of god therefore denies the ante 

it will not flourish y cedent 

if a stone is exposed to the rays of the sun it will contract heat 
but it has not oern so exposed therefore 
it has not contracted heat 

the reasoning in the above is evidently fallacious because the stone 
might contract heat in some other way it will be observed the minor 
denies the antecedent this species of reasoning is from the admission of 
the consequent to the admission of the antecedent and is evidently inad 
missible for the same consequent may follow from other antecedents 

if a stone be exposed to the rays of gas ht it will contract heat 
but it has been so exposed therefore 
it has contracted heat 

ill disjunctives 

when the major premise is disjunctive the syllogism to which it be 
longs is called a disjunctive syllogism in a disjunctive proposition it is 
implied that at least some one of its members must be true if then all 
except one be denied in the minor premise the truth of this remaining 
one may be inferred in the conclusion 

the world is either eternally selfexistent or the work of some finite 
or infinite being 

but it is neither selfexistent nor the work of a finite being there 
fore it is the work of an infinite being 

in the minor premises all the predicates are removed except one and 
the conclusion must necessarily establish that one 

it is either spring summer or autumn 
but it is not spring or summer therefore 
it is autumn 

the coin is either gold silver or copper 
but it is neither gold nor silver therefore 
it is copper 

but some time after several of the categorical propositions are denied 
there are more than one predicate remaining in this case the conclusion 
will be a disjunctive proposition 

the coin is either gold silver copper or brass 
but it is neither gold nor silver 
it is therefore copper dr brass 

in these examples it is impked that any one of the categorical proposi 
tions may be true and hence if the minor affirms that proposition the 
rest must be denied in the conclusion e g 

the coin is either gold silver copper or brass 

but it is gold therefore 

it is either silver copper or brass 



oy loo 



ebdtjotion of oomfoukd syllogisms 

though the mien already laid down are lufficicnt for ascertaining the 
validity of hypothetical argumenth a however all deductive reasoning 
may ultimately le tested by the amtoulian dictum we must now show 
how a comound may be reduced so that this test may at once apply 

ifi again the major premiae bo hypothetical and the antecedent and 
consequent happen to have the same subject in this case the minor and 
conclusim are categorical and may therefore be easily formed into a 
regular syllogism 

if civsar was a tyrant he deserved deatli 
but ctusar was a tyrant therefore 
he deserved death 

in the above syllogism the major is hypothetical and the minor cat 
fforical a conditional proposition may be legitimately converted by uiking 
tne cofitradictory of the consecjuent for an antecedent and the contradictory 
of the antecedent for a consequent 

if cmar was a tyranty he deserved death mphest 
if he did ut deserve death ctfisar was not a tyrant 

this corresponds with the conversion of a categorical jroposition by 
contraposition hence every conditional proposition is in fact equivalent 
to a universal affirmative categorical propositionthe antecedent answering 
to the svbjectf and the consequent to xxxa predicate 

lot us assume then as a major the equivalent proposition that 
 all tyrants deserve death it is then reduced to a categorical syllogism 
in barbara 

all tyrants deserve death 

but cficsar was a tyrant therefore 

caesar deserved death 

but the above method of reduction will not apply when the antecedent 
and consequent have not the same subject the other method is to con 
sider every conditional as a universal anirmative ropohition of which the 
terms are entire propositions the antecedent answering to the subject and 
the consequent to the predicate 

if the season is good trade is likely to be brisk 
but the season is aood therefore 
trade is likely to le brisk 

thus — 

the moral confidence that the season will be good is the moral con 
fidence that trade will be brisk 
the present confidence is the confidence that the season will be good 
the present confidence is the confidence that trade will be brisk 

tlie above is a constructive conditional reduced to barbara but it is 
not to be supposed that such reduction alters the nature of a proposition 
but simply its form 



 eleicentjlby treatise 



desteuctivb conditional 



if trade is brisk wages will be iiigh 
but wages are not high therefore 
trade is not brisk 

thus — 

the cause or supposition of trade being good is the cause of wages 

being high 
the present cause is not the cause of trade being good therefore 
the present cause is not the cause of trade being good 

or again — 

to say that wages are high is not true 

to say that trade is god is to say that wages are high therefore 

to say that trade is good is not true 

in some cases it is better to unfold the argument into two syllogisms 

if fillimore is a good president america is likely to prosper 
but fillimore is a good president therefore 
america is likely to prosper 

thus 

fillimore is a good president 

the ruler of america is fillimore therefore 

the ruler of america is a good president 

again — 

every nation governed by a good president is likely to prosper 
america is governed by a good president therefore 
america is likely to prosper 

reduction of disjunctives 

a disjunctive may be reduced to a conditional by taking as an ante 
cedent the contradictory of one or more of its members 

it is either spring summer autumn or winter 

but it is spring therefore 

it is neither summer autumn or winter 

if it is neither spring nor summer it is either autumn or winter 
but it is neither spring or summer therefore 
it is autumn or winter 

the student can easily manage the rest 



irregular syllogisms 

we have hitherto been examining syllogisms stated in the logical form 
and now proceed to examine what are usually termed irregular syllogisms 
from the fact of their being stated in an abridged or defective shape but 



ok logic 

mtjr be easily expanded into regular syllogisms of these there 
are four nnds — 



 the enthymeme 

 the sorites 



 the epichrema 

 the dilemma 



i the bnthtmeme 

this is an irregular syllom which is stated in two propositions one a 
premise the other a conclusion it will be at once seen from the following 
example that the other premise is suppressed thus — 

napokoq violated the law of nations therefore 
he deserved death 

in the above instance we have the minor premise and the conclusion 
and have therefore only to supply the major premise in order to form a 
regular syllogism 

bveiy one who violates the law of nations deserves death 
napoleon violated the law of nations therefore 
napoleon deserved death 

again — 

every religion not based upon justice benevolence and piety is not 

of grod therefore 
mahometanism is not of god 

in this case the minor premise is omitted 

every religion not based on justice benevolence and piety is not 

of god 
mahometanism is not based on justice benevolence and piety 

therefore 
mahometanism is not of god 

in order to supply more readily the suppressed premise of an enthymeme 
the following rules have been laid down 

 if the term twice repeated be found in the subject of the conclusion 
the mqjor premise must be supplied 

 if the term twice repeated be found in the predicate of the con 
clusion the minor premise must be supplied thus — 

man is a reasonable being therefore 
man is accountable 

here the term twice repeated is man and is the subject of the con 
clusion hence the major premise must be supplied 

every reasonable being is accountable 
man is a reasonable being therefore 
man is accountable 

let us now illustrate the second rule 

a free people must be happy therefore 
the americans must be happy 



 elekentabt tbeatie 

the term twice repeated here is happy being the predicate of the 
conclusion hence the minor premise must be supplied 

a free people must be happy 

the americans are a free people therefore 

the americans must be happy 

it will be observed that in these cases the reasoning is purely syllogis 
tic and must accordingly be judged by the laws of the syllogism 

ii the sorites 

the sorites is derived from a greek word signifying an accumulation 
or heap being an abridged form of stating a train of arguments whose 
several propositions are so arranged that the predicate of the first becomes 
the subject of the second and so on in regular progression till at length 
the last predicate is affirmed of the first subject in the ultimate con 
clusion 

thus— 

the soul is a thinking substance 

a thinking substance is spirit 

spirit has no extension 

what has no extension has no organization 

what has no organization is indestructible 

what is indestructible is immortal therefore 

the soul is immortal 

this series of propositions may be continued to any length without 
weakening the ground on which the conclusion rests this arises from 
there being as many middle terms as there are intermediate propositions 
between the first and last proposition in order to reduce the above 
sorites to syllogisms take the second propositions for your major premise 

 a thinking substance is spirit 
the soul is a thinking substance 
the soul is spirit 

 the spirit has no extension 
the soul is spirit 

the soul has no extension 

 what has no extension has no organization 
ihe soul has no extension 

the soul has no organization 

 what has no organization is indestructible 
the soul has no organization 

the soul is indestructible 

 what is indestructible is immortal 
the soul is indestructible therefore 
the soul is immortal 

it will be observed that the first proposition in a sorites is the only 
minor premise expressed because each successive conclusion becomes the 
minor premise of the succeeding syllogism hence the first and last pro 
positions only can be particular the intermediate must be major premises 



on logic 

it b obvious also that in a sorites there can ho onljr one negative premise 
vis the last in the series of four if the others were negative we should 
have a negative minor premise which is inadmissible in the first figure 
it is further evident that a sorites may be formed of conditional as well 
as of jcategorical prolositions in the case of a conditional sorites the 
consequent of the first shall become successively the antecedent of the 
next in which case by establishing the antecedent of the first proposition 
we establish the consequent of the last or by securing the last consequent 
we reserve also the first antecedent 

constructive conditional sorites 

if free trade be the true system of commercial policy it is sure to in 
crease human labour 

if it is sure to increase human labour it must increase human 
comforts 

if it increases human comforts it must advance human happiness 

if it advances human happiness it must advance the cause of human 
progress 

but it does advance the cause of human progress therefore 

free trade is the true system of commercial policy 

in the case of a destnictive conditional sorites we must go back to tho 
denial of the last consequent and to the denial of the first antecedent 

if the soul is material it must have extension 
if it has extension it must have organization 
if it has organization it may be destructible 
if it be destructible it is mortal 
but it is not mortal i therefore 
it is not material 

it is very easy for the student to resolve these examples into regular 

syllogiims and to try their validity by the rules formerly laid down i 

cannot help giving the following specimens of a sorites before i conclude 

this subject the first is the merry argument of themistoclcs that his son 

a boy of ten years of age governed the whole world thus — 

my son governs his mother his mother governs me i the athenians 
the athenians the greeks greece commands europe europe the whole 
world therefore my son governs the whole world 

the next is from qlcero — 

quoniam deos beatissimos sue constat 
beatus autem nemo sine virtute esse potest

all perfectly happy beings are virtuous 
the gods are perifectly happy beings 
the gods are virtuous 

all virtuous beings have reason 

the gods are virtuous beings therefore 

the gods have reason

all who have reason are in the human fomiy

the two following verses from john l appelr to me somewhit to 
resemble a logical sorites 

 in him was life and the life was the light of men 
 the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended 
it not 

ni epichbbma 

this is a syllogism to one or both of whose premises the proof is 
immediately subjoined — 

those who waylay a man to kill him it is lawful for him to kill as is 
allowed by the laws of nature and of nations and by the practices of 
the best of men 

but clodius waylaid milo with that view as appears from his forming 
an ambuscade before his country house his arms his guards c 
therefore 

it was lawfril for milo to kill clodius 

the proof is sometimes attached to both premises and sometimes only 
to the minor 

all useful studies deserve encouragement 

logic is a useful study because it assists us to detect error and to 

reason accurately therefore 
logic deserves encouragement 

in this case the major premise is self evident so that the proof is 
attached to the minor 

all useful studies deserve encouragement 
logic is a useful study therefore 
logic deserves encouragement 

wliatever assists us to detect error and to reason accurately deserves 

encouragement 
logic does this therefore

every thing is a blessing to men that leads them to prepare for eternity 
because in so doing they act wisehr secure their present peace — and pro

sometimes a blessing to men see pitts speech on the slave trade 

ly dilemma 

the true dilemma appears to me to be a conditional syuoffism with 
several antecedents m the major and a disjunctive minor the term itself 



ok looio 

is derived from the greek from the principal members of which such an 
argument consists it is sometimes called the comatua syllogismaa the 
homed syllogism — whence the horns of a dilemma it is also called the 
crocodounuu ayuogismusy because the crocodile either leads such to the nile 
as follow it or pursues such as fly to destroy them of dilemmas there 
are three kinds — 

 the simple dilemma the dilemma improper 

 the compound dilemma 

i the simple constructive 

if the blest in heaven have no desires they will be perfectly content 
so they will if their desires are fully gratified but they will either have 
no desires or they will be fully gratified therefore in either case they will 
be perfectly content 

destructive 

if this man were wise he would not speak irreverently of the scriptures 
in jest and if he were good he would not do so in earnest but he does it 
either in jest or in earnest therefore he is either not wise or not good 

dilemma improper 

if the world were eternal the most useful arts such as printing c 
would be of unknown antiouity and on this supposition there would be 
records long prior to the mosaic and likewise the sea and land in all 
parts of the globe might be expected to maintain their same relative situa 
tions now as formerly but none of these are the fact therefore the world 
is not eternal 

the above is simply two conditional syllogisms conjoined 

it may be observed that the arguments generallv called dilemmas 
differ very little from conditional syllogisms and in the following 
examples the one may be reduced to two destnictive conditionals and 
the other to two constructive conditionals 

if this man were prudent he would behave well for his own sake 
if he were benevolent he would behave well for the good of others 
but he does not behave well for his own sake or for the good 

of others therefore 
he is neither prudent nor benevolent 

thus— 

if this man were prudent he would behave well for his own sake 
but he does not behave well for his own sake therefore 
he is not prudent 

again 

if this man were benevolent he would behave well for the good 

of others 
but he does not behave well for the good of others therefore 
he is not benevolent 



 slemkjilabt tbkaiisb 

the next is an example of the constructive dilemma reduced to two 
conditionals 

if this spendthrift is rich he is prodigal 
if he is poor he is unjust 
but he is neither rich or poor therefore 
ue is either prodigal or unjust 

if this spendthrift is rich he is prodigal 
but he is rich therefore 
he is prodigal 

again — 

if this spendthrift is poor he is unjust 
but he is poor therefore 
he is unjust 

the following is another instance of the destructive dilemma 

if schylus joined in the public rejoicings he is inconsistent 

if he did not he is unpatriotic 

but he either did join or not therefore 

he is either inconsistent or unpatriotic 

it may be reduced thus — 

if schylus joined in the public rejoicings he is inconsistent 
but he did join therefore 
he is inconsistent 

again — 

if schylus did not join in the public rejoicing he is un 
patriotic 
but he did not join thirefore 
he is unpatriotic 

it may be observed that the dilemma is generally employed to prove 
the absurdity or falsity of some assertion in order to this we 
assume a conditional proposition the antecedent of which is the asser 
tion to be disproved and the consequent is a disjunctive proposition 
enumerating all the possible suppositions on which the assertion can 
take place it appears then if we deny each of the consequents the 
antecedent must be false thus if we have such a proposition 
as this for the major premise and the minor rejects the consequent it 
is obvious that the conclusion must reject the antecedent assertion 
when we have admitted truth to two or more conjunctive proposi 
tions with the same consequent but different antecedents and these 
antecedents are such that you cannot be sure of the truth of one of 
them separately but are certain that one or other is true then the 
dilemma is used 

when we have a major premise having several antecedents but 
only one consequent e one consequent to all and these antecedents 
are disjunctively granted in the minor then the conclusion infers the 
consequent common to all these antecedents but the dilemma is 
not confined to the constructive form but also takes the destructive 
if the major premise has several antecedents each with a separate 
consequent and the minor premise disjunctively denies the consequents 



on logic 

the conclusion may disjunctively deny the antecedents in order to 
preyent a dilemma being retorted by an antagonist the following rules 
should be observed 

• a full enumeration of parts 

£ that the dilemma press the adversary alone and the person who 
makes it be not liable to have it retorted upon him 

in the course of my historical readings i have selected the following 
specimens from celebrated authors which i lay before the student 
for the exercise of his judgment 

a lady wishing to dissuade her son from marriage used the follow 
ing dilemma 

either the woman you marry will be handsome or ugly 

if handsome she will caue you jealousy if ugly displeasure 

cicero uses the following beautiful dilemma to prove that all pain 
is to be borne with patience 

every pain is either violent or light 

if light it will be easily borne 

if violent it will be of short duration 

the same orator used the following dilemma to prove that no mes 
sengers should be sent to antony 

legates decernitis si ut deprecenter contemnet 
si ut imperltis non audiet 

nor must we omit the beautiful dilemma of tertuuian whereby 
he clears the christians and accuses trajan who forbade seeking them 
out and yet ordered them to be prosecuted when found 

 o sententiam necessitate confusam negat inquircndos ut nocentes 
et mandat puniendos ut innocentes parcit suevit dissimulat et 
animadvertit quid temetipsum censura circum venis si damnas 
cur non et inquiris si non inquiris cur non et absolvis 

the following is that of an ancient prophetess dissuading her son 
from haranguing the people 

 nam si injusta suaseris habebis deos iratos sin vero justa 
iratos habebis homines the youth thus retorted upon his mother 
imo says he kxpedit ad populuqi verba facere nam si justa 
dixero dii me amabunt si injusta homines 

this kind of argument was used by the opponents of don carlos to 
the throne of spain they say — 

 if a king of spain has a right to alter the law of succession 
carlos has no claim and if no king of spain has that right carlos 
has no claim but a king of spain either has or has not such a 
right therefore in either case carlos has no claim 

i shall conclude with the following — 

euathlus a rich young man desirous of learning the art of pleading 
applied to protagoras a celebrated sophist to instruct him offering a 



 



 elementabt tbeatie 

great sum as his reward one half of which was paid down the other 
half to be paid as soon as he should plead a cause and gain it 
protagoras found him an apt scholar but after he had made good pro 
gressy he was in no haste to plead causes the master conceiying 
tiiat by this means he intended to shift off the second payment took 
as he thought a sure method of getting the better of his delay he 
sued euathlus before the judges and haying opened his case at the 
bar he pleaded to this purpose o most foolish young man do 
you not see that in any event i must gain my point for if the 
judges give sentence for me you must pay by dieir sentence if 
against me the conditions of our bargain are fulfilled and you have 
no plea left for your delay after having pleaded and gained a cause 
to which euatiilus replied o most wbe master i might have 
avoided the force of your argument by not pleading my own cause 
but giving up this advantage do you not see that whatever sentence 
the judges pass i am safe if they give sentence for me i am acquitted 
by their sentence if against me the conditions of our bargain are not 
fulfilled by my pleading a cause and loosing it the judges 
thinking the arguments unanswerable on both sides put off the cause 
to a long day 

fallacies 

all fallacies are the negation of truth so that in examining them 
we are really considering a species of negative logic fallacies may 
be considered either intentional or unintentional the latter being 
synonymous with superstition and incredulity the former fallacies 
strictly so called generally involve the element of intention employed 
so as to effect some purpose as we are all liable to be wrong 
a priori and as deceptive reasoning is still prevalent it is of great im 
portance that we should be acquainted with the doctrine of the 
fallacies so as to be more able to detect error under whatever guise 
it is presented to our minds aristotle divided the fallacies into two 
great classes fallacies in the matter and fallacies in the orm the 
former he denominated fallacia extra dictumem the latter fallada 
in dictione the division generally adopted by logicians now is the 
following — 

 logical fallacies semi logical fallacies 

 nonlogical fallacies 

there are many grave objections to this division as not being sufii 
ciently comprehensive and i apprehend the following is much more 
perfect — 



 fallacies of intuition 

 fallacies of judgment 



 fallacies of induction 

 fallacies of deduction 



in accordance with this arrangement the fallacies of intuition fall 
first to be examined 

 fallacies of intuition 

these again may be subdivided into — 

 subjective fallacies objective fallacies 



ok logic 

what has been tenned subjectiye fallacies are simply the fallacious 
tendencies of the human mind and shall be examined under the head of 
induction 

 objbctiye faluloies of intuxtiok 

the principal fallacies under this head are alse perqeptions 
iufisions optwu deceptions and such like to this may be traced 
ghost stories hobgoblins the tricks of jugglers popish miracles and 
illusions of reverie thus supposing a person witnessed the feats 
performed by the great wizard of the north his senses would be im 
posed upon just in the same way that a sophist would impose upon 
the judgment we are very often deceived by the senses in 
looking at an object through mist but at no time is a person so 
likely to be deceived with such illusions as when false perceptions 
flash across the mind in a nervous state of excitement or when the 
mind is lost in some reverie 

 fallaoies of judgbcent 

under this head fails to be considered what logicians have termed 
nonlogical fallacies 

 fallacia noh causae pro causa 

 petetio principii 
 ignoratio elenchi 

the fallacies now to be considered are to be found in the premises 
of an argument and not in the connexion between them and the con 
clusions it is the judgment therefore that can alone detect and 
expose them each of the above assume various phases and are 
presented under diflerent aspects 



i pbekises false ob umsufpobtbd

 elementaby treatise 



iii irbelevant conclusion ignoratio elenchi 

 confasion of terms 

 emotion or sentiment sought to be substituted instead of the 
real conclusion 

 shifting ground 

 fallacy of objections 

 proving part 

 suppressing conclusion 

the above i apprehend embraces the leading forms which the above 
fallacies assume 

i premises false ob unsupported 

 the fallacies of causation — this fallacy consists as it is gen 
erally expressed in assigning an event to a wrong cause — an error 
into which men have always been prone to fall it is sometimes 
• non causse pro causa or non effectus pro effcctu many of the 
doctrines of ancient philosophy are reducible to this head as for 
instance when the peripatetics gravely informed us that nature 
abhorred a vacuum and that this was the cause why water would not 
run out of a long tube if it were turned upside down if a comet 
appears or an eclipse of the sun or moon takes place it is customary 
for them to look upon these phenomena as the forerunners of war 
pestilence and famine and if a person has been guilty oi some 
crime and shortly after meets with some temporal calamity the one 
is ascribed to the other or if involved in afflictions it is concluded 
that these are judgments come upon him for his iniquities but all 
these conclusions are mere sophisms it may also be observed that 
many of the popular objections to christianity are to be referred to 
this head 



in analyzing the process that takes place in this fallacy we shall 
find that that which chiefly distinguishes it is the assumption of one 
of the premises this assumption will either be a pretended cause to 
establish a supposed effect or i pretended effect to establish a supposed 
caussy or di pretended connexion assumed between two existing facts 



thus — 

rau cruel persons will be visited with some heavy 
pretended cause j calamity 

assumed j this person is cruel therefore 

he will be visited with a heavy calamity 

or again — 

all afflicted persons must have been peculiarly 
guilty 
this person has been afflicted therefore 
he must have been peculiarly guilty 

again — 

 all persons who take medicine are cured 

xt n i this person took medicine therefore 
but that is all he was cured 



ok looxo 

in the last syllogism the fallacy is obvious for though the facts are 
admitted to a certain extent that is all that we can say the supposed 
connexion cannot be inferred the best plan to detect such fallacies 
is to supply the supposed premise 

whenever a comet has appeared a war has taken place 
a comet has appeared this year therefore 
a war will take place 

another form of this fallacy is that of bold assertions or indirect 
insinuations of an unsupported premise this is particularly the 
case with infidel objections in respect to christianity such as christi 
anity is a foe to liberty an abettor of tyranny c therejis your 
chrutian govimment there are your christian parsons c another 
form which it assumes is called a fallacy of reference for example 
supposing you argue with an illiterate man and vanquish him com 
pletely reference is made to such and such a champion of the cause 
who would soon establish what he was advocating c another form 
of this fallacy is what is called an assumed parallelism non tali pro 
talu this takes place when a person argues from a case not parsdlel 
as if it were parallel thus from the circumstance that some persons 
have abused charity it has been contended that to give alms in any 
case is improper or because a person from a particular class of 
society when raised to a station of trust and importance has acted 
improperly it has been argued that to raise any other of that class to 
the same station must be attended with similar evil consequences 
in the non tali pro tau the supposed premise is false for it is in this 
premise that the parallelism is affirmed and in the non vera pro 
vera the expressed premise is false 

the limit from which this fallacv assumes is that of undue proba 
bility this often takes place when in a long chain of argument 
we omit to calculate the probabilities in each successive step each 
step may have an excess of chances in its favour and yet the ultimate 
conclusion may have a great preponderance against it 

for example — 

the reports which this author heard are probably true 

this which he records is a report which he probably heard 

therefore 
this statement is probably true 

suppose the majority of the reports he heard byour out of seven 
are true and that he generally say two in three times reports faith 
fully what he heard it follows that of twentyone of his reports only 
eight are true 

ii unduly assumbd frbmises 

this fedlacy is generally known as the petith prinoipiiy or begging 
the question one form of it is that the premise virtually involves 
the conclusion such as the celebrated metaphysical axiom of descartes 
 ego cogito ergo ego sum i think therefore i exist another 
form of this fallacy is when the premise and conclusion bear the same 

i 



 flemetaby treatise 

meaning though differently worded thus the amusing doggrel in 
mills logic — 

 mihi deraandatur 
a doctissimo doctore 
quare opium facit dormire 

et ego respondeo 
quia est in eo 
virtus dormitiva 
cujus natura est sensus assoupire 

though be it observed it may be perfectly allowable at the com 
mencement of an argument to take for granted a premise that is not 
more evident than the conclusion or that may be disputed by your 
adversary provided you engage fairly to prove that premise after 
wards it is also perfectly allowable in an argument to begin by 
deducing your conclusion from a premise which may be exactly 
equivalent to the one which is to be proved provided that no undue 
advantage be taken in respect to the point in question but in doing 
this the sophist will endeavour to blink the question altogether or in 
a flourish of words merely bring forward the same proposition ex 
pressed in synonymous terms thus were the question in dispute 
whether christian unity is preserved in the roman catholic church 
alone if a member of that church were to argue as follows he would 
be guilty of this fallacy examine the catholic church in every age 
and in every country and you will find it precisely the same from his 
holiness the pope down to the meanest member of the true church — 
from the days of the apostles down to the present time a sacred 
unity has ever been preserved this is obviously a mere fallacy for 
what ought to be proved is boldly assumed tn order to answer 
a person reasoning as above he ought to be asked in what does this 
unify consist is it a unity of 

 intelligence j action or of opinion 

 love i doctrine 

if a unity of doctrine is it meant by this that the church always 
held the same dogmas if so how is it that pope pius added 
another article of belief to the creed of the church the other day at 
gkieta that of the immgculacy of the virgin mary is it a unity of 
intelligence certainly not is it a unity of love let the bloody 
wars of popish nations answer is it a unity of action or of opinion 
no let jansenists and jesuits answer is it a unity or rather union 
of expediency yes and this for the express purpose of more effectually 
trampling on human liberty and every thing that is sacred to man 

the last form of this fallacy is that of reasoning in a circle the 
above church has made unsparing use of this fallacy likewise to support 
her pretensions it is to be observed that this species of reasoning 
takes place when the same propositions are made alternately premises 
and conclusions thus the church of rome has contended that the 
scriptures are so obscifffe and ambiguous that when left to themselves 
they are more liky to generate error than truth to foment division 
rather than to produce unanimity and agreement to this objection 
it may be replied what is the reason that the scriptures may not be 
trusted alone why say our opponents they are liable to be 



on logic 

misinterpreted und wrested to coimtenance the respective opinions and 
practices of different seels and parties granted but what remedy 
can be devised to obviate this evil is their use to be entirely pro 
scribed • no say they but they must be invariably accompanied by 
another book which may be considered in the light of an authorized 
commentary then are we to judge the bible by the commentary 
yes but how are we to judge of the commentary it is to be read 
upon the authority of the church yes but how am i to judge of 
the authority of the church it is to be plainly seen in the bible 
then i am in the first place to judge the bible by the commentary 
then the commentary by the authority and then the authority by the 
bible so that after all my own reason is the ultimate judge of the 
bible round this vicious circle poor roman peter may be eter 
nally lashed 

iii irrelevant conclusion ignoratio elenchi 

this is the fallacy of an irrelevant conclusion and it takes place 
when the proposition which you prove is not the contradictory of 
your opponents assertion thus if the advocate of a person con 
victed of a crime in court were to attempt to dispute the charge by 
proving that the person had been greatly injured — that he was a man 
of excellent character — that nothing of the kind had ever before been 
laid to his charge and that he was highly connected he would be 
guilty of this fallacy for none of these points was the matter under 
consideration and they might be all true while his guilt remained 

one form which this fallacy assumes is that of a confusion of 
terms thus if a person should attempt to prove that the inha 
bitants of a civilized country were noifree and in proof of this prove 
that they misi be subject to such and such laws he would be guilty of 
this fallacy anotlier form of this fallacy is that of substituting 
for the real conclusion an emotion or a sentiment popular orators 
who expatiate on supposed national wrongs are very often guilty of 
this fallacy andl apprehend that the late daniel oconnelis speeches 
would furnish a rich supply of these fallacious sophicisms and more 
paiticularly that form of the fallacy under present consideration 
thus instead of proving that the irish was a nation of slaves honest 
dan would exclaim to poor paddy — 

 oh erin wert thou free 
urst flower of the earth 
fitbt gem ol the sea 

a third form which this fallacy assumes is that of shifting the 
ground when the sophist cannot maintain his point he shifts 
the ground of the argument to some other view of the subject which 
he can more easily defend this he frequently does by substituting a 
particular for a universal term or vice versa or he may prove some 
thing possible when he ought to prove it probable ox probable when it 
ought to have been found necessary or he may prove it to be not 
necessary when it should have been proved tiot probable or improbable 
when he should have shown that it was impossible a fourth form 
assumed by this fallacy is that of the fallacy of objections this 
form of the fallacy is practised by showing that there are objections 



 slembntrt tftsatise 

against the point in dispite and from thence infering that it ought not 
to he received this is the fallacy most commonly hrought forward 
hy those who attempt to impugn the divine origin of the christian 
religion jt may he assumed thus qranted that there are some 
parts of christianity that cannot he satisfactorily explained hut as 
the religion exists this is the phenomenon — if we reject it we are 
hound to give some solution to this phenomenon less open to objec 
tions than we nd from the adoption of it we are bound in candour 
to adduce some hypothesis that will give a likely solution to the quejb 
tion connected with historical facts and all tbe circumstances of the 
case that infidels have never done this though they have had 
years to try amounts to a confession that no such hypothesis can be 
devised which will not be open to greater objections than lie against 
christianity a fourth form of this fallacy is proving a point and 
then drawing a conclusion as if the whole were proved or disproved 
nothing affords a better example of this fallacious mode of reasoning 
than the present system of reviewing works as they issue from the 
press this is the case whether the review be favourable or un 
favourable the last form which this fallacy assumes is that of 
 suppressing the conclusion here the sophist instead of stating 
the conclusion will try to suppress it altogether and conclude the 
argument by merely stating the inference is from this plain thus i 
 have fully established my point the position of my opponent is 
completely overthrown c 

iii fallacies of indttction 

under this head may be considered the idola of bacon he has 
denominated the various causes of error the idols of the under 
standing and arranged them into four classes 



 idola tribus 

 idola species 



 idola fori 

 idola theatri 



to every false notion of the mind lord bocon has given the name 
of idol by this figurative term he elegantly distinguishes between 
false science and true these erroneous notions are a specious of 
idols which usurp the homage which the mind ought to render only 
to truth and are therefore designated as false doctrines which ought 
to be destroyed and to be abandoned of these causes of error the 
first class includes — 

the idola tribus or idols of the tribe 

these have their foundation in human nature itself without regard 
to any modifying circumstances and are therefore incident to the 
whole tribe or race of man 

this head lord bacon illustrates in a very admirable manner by 
showing how apt we are to reason on a mere assumption to regard 
our preconceived opinions to follow our imagination to expect too 
much from our limited capacities to trust too implicitly to the test 
ing of our senses and to cherish an undue fondness for generaliz 
ation 



ov looxo 

in illuitration of these particulars lord bacon observes that the 
mind supposes a greater order and uniformity in things than is 
really the case tiiough many things are unique and many thiujis 
extremely dissimilar yet the mind is stiu imagining parallels corres 

sondenciesy and relatiyes that hare no real existence hence the 
ction of uie ancient astronomers that ail celestial bodies more in 
perfect circles that there were only four elements in nature c 

with regard to our preconceived notions he observes that when 
the mind is once pleased with certain things it draws all others to 
consent and go along with them hence in cases of superstition of 
astrology dreams omens and such like vanities those who find 
pleasure in these things always observe when the event answers to 
their predictions but pass over or but slightly notice the instances 
in which their predications fail which generally are by far the most 
numerous 

the passions and affections also lead us often astray the light of 
the understanding is not a pure or dry light but is drenched in the 
will and affections hence what men desire to bo true they are most 
easily inclined to believe so that in numberless ways and sometimes 
in a manner almost imperceptible the affections and propositions of 
men tinge and affect their understanding too implicit confidence 
in the report of the senses is also another fruitful source of error 
and misconception those things that strike the senses unjustly 
overbalance those that do not and little or no regard is paid to 
objects that lie beyond the reach of physical examination we are 
thus led to judge of spiritual natures as we do of material objects 
around us and to invest the supreme being with a figure and 
pourtray him with passion similar to man another fertile source of 
misconception is an undue fondness for abstraction generalization c 
all of which have their origin in the uniformity of the human mind 
and to which all are alike liable 

the second class in lord bacons division is the 

idola sfecibs ob thb idols of thb dek 

these are prejudices which have their foundation not in the con 
stitution of human nature but in something peculiar to the individual 
they arise from the peculiar organization of the individual and are 
produced by the education customs pursuits and other accidental 
circumstances that tend to form the human character hence men 
are fond of some sciences and studies either because they have be 
stowed much pains upon them or because they have been peculiarly 
successful in their prosecution their thoughts are thus confined to 
a certain tract and when they venture out of their beaten course and 
apply themselves to any new point they generally endeavour to 
wrest and torture it so to agree with their preconceived notions 
they judge of things by the maxims of their profession and view them 
under the aspect and through the dark glass of former prejudice 
as one instance in point mr locke mentions an eminent musician who 
believed that qod created the world in six days and rested upon the 
seventh because there were seven notes in bittsic a third class of 
prejudices in this division is the 



 elementary treatise 



idola fori ob idols of the mabket place 

these have their ongin in the imperfection of human language 
in all places of public resort or wherever the general intercourse of 
mankind is carried on words are used in a loose lax and capricious 
sense this is perhaps of all the most prolific source of human 
prejudice as misconceptions insinuate themselves into the mind from 
the associations of words and terms the idols which words impress 
on the understanding are ranked under two heads by lord bacon 

 the names of things that have no real existence 

 the names of things that do exist 

of the former he mentions the prtmum mobile the orbs of the 
planets the element of fire and fictions of a like nature many 
terms of this kind exist at the present day such as chance fortune 
nature luck c which have nothing corresponding to them in actual 
existence but which from being used in a vague indefinite sense 
often lead to serious eitor both in judging and in reasoning 

the others are those which have a corresponding existence in 
nature as an example the word moisture is selected by his lordship 

thus moisture signifies that which is undeterminable of itself and 
cannot fix — that which yields easily every way — that which readily 
divides and scatters itself — that which easily unites with itself and runs 
together — that which easily flows and is set in motion — that which 
readily sticks to another body and wets it — and that which is easily 
melted or reduced from a solid to a fluid now when this term comes 
to be employed with an exception of some of the significations flame 
will be moist with the exception of others air is not moist with the 
exception of some others fine powdered glass may be said to be moist 
hence therefore that the notion taken from this term has been incon 
siderately taken from water and other common liquids aud has not 
been truly verified or made to agree precisely with the thing which it 
signifies before it was adopted 

the last class of prejudices contains those which lord bacon 
denominates idola theatri these are the prejudices of fashion and 
of authority which spring from great names or from following a 
master which arise from the systems we adopt or the sects which we 
have espoused these like the representations of the stage are likely 
to impose upon us hence the approbation they have received pre 
judices of this nature are not to be found in the nature of man itself 
but are imposed upon us by false theories and perverted laws of demon 
stration such theories have abounded in the philosophical political 
and religious worlds such then are the various sources of error 
which fill our minds with prejudices or idols and pervert our judg 
ments and reasonings the necessity of dislodging which is obvious 
and of seeking as much as possible to free the mind from their per 
nicious influence both in searching after truth and of communicating 
it to others or in the language of bacon these several sorts of idols 
are all of them to be solemnly and for ever renounced that the under 
standing may be thoroughly purged and cleansed for the kingdom of 
man which is founded in the sciences can scarcely be entered other

children 

iv fallaoiss of dbdvottok 
under this head will be examined what is generally termed 
i logical fallacies ii semi logical fallacies 

we shall first examine those that are considered primarily logical 
or where the conclusion does not follow from the premises 

 illicit process 

 undistributed middle 
 negative premise 

 affirmative conclusion from negative premise 
 negative conclusion from affirmative premise 
 more than three premises 

 semilogioal fallacies 

i forms a term ambiguous in itself 

a fallacy of etymology or of figurcd dictionia 

b „ interrogationum 

c „ equivocationis 

d „ amphibolise 

ii ambiguous from the context 

a fallacia divisionis 
• z compos tionis 

c „ accidentis 

d „ substantias secundum quid a dictum simplicter 

vice versa 

what are called pure logical fallacies have been already illustrated 
under the special rules for constructing the syllogisms and it would be 
merely repeating what has been already laid down to illustrate them 
with examples there is one mode of fallacious reasoning however 
which may be referred to this head the common error of supposing 
the conclusion false because the argument is unsound or of supposing 
the premises true because the conclusion is a truth 

thus— 

whatever is universally believed must be true 

the existence of a god is not universally believed therefore 

the existence of a god is not true 



 eleuentabt txatib 

thia syllogism is a pure fallacy because there is an itucit process 
of the major the term true is distributed in the conclusion by 
being the predicate of a negative proposition while it is not distri 
buted in the major premise being then only the predicate of an 
affirmative proposition 

again — 

whatever is universally believed is true 
the existence of god is true therefore 
the existence of a god is universally believed 

in this case we have the fallacy of an undistributed middle because 
the middle term true is neither the subject of a universal nor the 
predicate of a negative proposition the argument is therefore in 
conclusive the fallacy of the following unsound argument would 
not be very perceptible at first sight 

every rational agent is not accountable 
brutes are not rational agents therefore 
brutes are not accountable 

the above syllogism is principally analogous to the following — 

every ass is an animal 

sheep are not asses therefore 

sheep are not animals 

this is particularly the best way to refute such a fallacy there is 
one syllogism however with which we have met very difficult of 
solution and which we shall leave to the ingenuity of the student 
to solve — 

what is not praiseworthy is not virtuous 
some pleasures are not praiseworthy therefore 
some pleasures are not virtuous 

ii semiloqical fallacies 

in logical fallacies the extremes are compared with two parts of 
the same terms but in those now to be considered they are compared 
with two different terms because the middle term is used in different 
senses in the two premises 

 a term ambiguous in itself 

a fallacy op etymology figtjkab dictionis 

this fallacy takes place when a term is introduced in an argument 
which resembles in sound the one for which it is substituted but not 
in sense 

theorists are unsafe guides 

this man has formed a theory therefore 

he is an unsafe gtdde 



on looic 

honco the fallacy lies in insinuating that he who forms a theory 
using tho term in its proper acceptation must bo a theoristy every one 
who revels in tho airy fictions of his own imagination 

again 

to be suspected of witchcraft is a presumption of guilt 
this woman is so suspected therefore 
wc may presume that she is guilty 

the fallacy here lies in supposing an exact correspondence between 
presume and presumption this however is not the case presump 
tion in the one premise evidently means a slight suspicion 
whereas to presume is used to express absolute belief some 
times this fallacy arises from a word being used at one time in its 
customary y and at another in its etymological sense 

h fallacia interrogationum 

this fallacy consists in asking several questions which appear to be 
but one in such a way that whatever one answer is given being of 
course applicable to only one of the questions may be interpreted as 
applied to some one of the others thus if it be asked are virtue 
and vice desirable whether you reply yes or no you are equally 
entangled if however you reply to each question separately you 
detect and expose the fallacy thus virtue is desirable vice is not 
but if several questions that are proposed together are accordingly 
brought forward as distinct questions there is no fallacy in the case 
thus christ put two questions to the pharisees respecting the baptism 
of john — 

was the baptism of john from heaven 
or was it of men 

the above questions are perfectly legitimate it will be observed 
that the poor pharisees were put upon the horns of a dilemma by 
these questions for whatever answer they gave was equally detrimental 
to them hence they viewed the horns and kept at a respectful 
distance from them 

e fallacia equivocationis 

this fallacy takes place when one of the terms in an argument has 
in itself from its own equivocal nature two meanings 



thus — 



or— 



the dog barks 

the dog is a star therefore 

the star barks 



walking is healthy 

this man is walking therefore 

this man is healthy 



 elememtahy treatise 

d fallacia amphiboliae 

this fallacy takes place when a sentence employed in reasoning is 
capable of two meanings not from any double sense of any of the 
terms but from its admitting of a double construction the heathen 
oracles of old afford us many examples of this ambiguity thus the 
response given to croesus king of lydia previous to his going to war 
with cyrus 

 if croesus goes to war a great empire shall be overthrown 

the oracle might safely predict this because battles in those days 
generally decided the fate of empires poor croesus thought this 
referred to cyius whereas it so happened that it was his own empire 
that was overthrown similar to this is the witch prophecy in 
shakspeare 

 the duke yet lives that henry shall depose 

this may either signify that the duke lives who shall depose henry 
or whom henry shall depose under this fallacy comes the famous 
logical puzzle of achilles and the tortoise the argument is let 
achilles run ten times as fast as the tortoise yet if the tortoise has 
the start achilles will never overtake him 

hobbes hinted that the fallacy lies in the tacit assumption that what 
is infinitely divisible is infinite the following solution is given to 
it in mills logic the argument is let achilles run ten times as 
fast as the tortoise yet if the tortoise has the start achilles will never 
overtake him to suppose them to be at first separated by an interval 
of feet when achilles has run these feet the tortoise 
would have got when achilles has got those the tortoise 
will have run and so on for ever therefore achilles may run for 
ever without overtaking the tortoise 

now for ever in the conclusion means for any length of time 
that can be supposed but in the premise ever does not mean any 
length of time it means any number of suhditistons of time it means 
that we divide feet by and the quotient again by and so 
on as often as we please that there never will be an end to the sub 
divisions of the distance nor consequently to those of the time in 
which it is performed but an unlimiied number of subdivisions may 
be made of that which is itself limited the argument proves no 
other infinity of duration than may be embodied in five minutes so 
long as the five are not expired what remains of them may be 
divided by ten and again by ten as often as we like which is 
perfectly compatible with there being only five minutes altogether it 
proves in short that to pass through the infinite space requires a time 
which is infinitely divisible but not an infinite time the confounding 
of which distinction hobbes had already seen to be the gist of the 
fallacy 

ii tebms allbigtjons fboli the context 

a fallacia divisionis 

this fallacy takes place when we affirm of it only in a divided 
sense what is only true of it ccuectively for example — 



on logic 

five is one number 

three and two are five therefore 

three and two are one number 

again — 

the members of the houses upper and lower constitute the 

british parliament 
lord brougham and joseph hume are members of the houses 

upper and lower therefore 
lord brougham and joseph hume constitute the british 

parliament 

or again — 

these persons can lift ten tons 

this man is one of these persons therefore 

this man can lift ten tons 

this fallacy very often turns on the ambiguity of the word all 
which may however be dispelled by substituting for it the word 
 every or each where that is its true signification 

ft fallacia compositionis 

this fallacy is the reverse of the former and takes place when we 
assume that to be true collectively which is only true distributively 

thus — 

two and three are an equal and an unequal number 
two and three are five therefore 
five is an equal and an unequal number 



again — 



three and two are two numbers 
five is three and two therefore 
five is two numbers 



in these examples the ambiguity of the middle term is obvious 
being used in the major premise diatrihuiively and in the minor 
collectively 

c fallacia acgidentis 

this fallacy takes place when a person argues for or against anything 
from what is merely accidental instead of what is essential to the 
subject this fallacious mode of reasoning must also be referred to 
an ambiguous middle this middle term is used in one premise to 
signify something considered as to its essential properties in the other 
premise it is considered as implying that its properties are taken into 
account with it 



thus — 



what is sold in the market is food for man 
undressed meat is sold in the market therefore 
undressed meat is the food of man 



 £leh£ntabt treatise 

in the above instance the middle term in the major premise is 
understood as to its essential properties and in the minor to its acci 
dental circumstances 

again — 

christianity existed from the days of the apostles 
protestantism did not exist from the days of the apostles but 

only from the time of luther therefore 
protestantism is not christianity 

the fallacy here lies in the error of insinuating that what is true of 
any subject considered simply in itself must be true likewise of it in 
all its particular modifications the absurdity of the above popish 
argument will become apparent when an analogous one is brought 
forward 

lord derby existed last century 

the present first lord of the treasury did not exist last century 

but only from the time of his appointment to this high office 

therefore 
lord derby is not first lord of the treasury 

by bringing forward a parallel case all such sophisms may be in a 
popular manner triumphantly refuted 

d fallacia substantiab secundum quid ad dictum 

aut vicessim 

this fallacy is very nearly allied to the preceding and takes place 
when any person argues for a thing in an absolute sense when it is only 
true in a restricted sense or the contrary 

opium is poison secundum quid physicians proscribed it 
an ethiopian is white as to his teeth therefore 
he is white 
a man acted prudently in certain particular circumstances 

therefore 
he will so act under circumstances or vice versa 

or thus — 

prodigies and omens are not to be believed 

livy in his roman history describes omens and prodigies therefore 

livy in his roman history is not to be believed 

again — 

all men have a right to their personal liberty 

a madman is a man therefore 

he has a right to his personal liberty 

all these fallacies can be easily solved by showing that a thing may 
be true in some respects while it is not so in others or that it may 
be true considered simply in itself while it is not so viewed under 
other circumstances 



on logic 

we have now gone through all the divisions of logic and unfolded 
the principles and laws of sound and sophistical reasoning and shall 
now proceed to examine briefly the views of others in respect to the 
legitimate province of this science 



the province of logic 

from the peculiar views lately propounded by some of our first 
logicians in respect to the legitimate province of the reasoning science i 
purpose briefly to advert to the opinions of whately leechman and mill 
they being the only modern logicians from whoso writings the student is 
likely to derive any practical advantage it will be remembered that the 
above writers have been already referred to — 

whately all reasoning from generals to particulars 

lbbchman o do 

mill from particulars to particulars 

o from particulars to particulars 

 from particulars and generals to generals and 

umversals 

 from generals and universals to particulars gene 

rals and universals 

according to dr whately all reasoning is deductive or from given 
premises admitted or assumed we draw a certain conclusion in the 
drawing of the conclusion consists the reasoning process which as a matter 
of course is to be tested by the aristotelian dictum in the following 
syllogism the learned prelate attempts to reduce the inductive to that of the 
deductive process — 

the earth mercury venus c move round the sun in an elliptical orbit 

these are planets therefore 

isome planets move round the sun in an elliptical orbit 

the natural inference here would be that all planets move round the 
sun in an elliptical orbit which would be false out it will be obvious to 
any one who examines the above syllogism that there is no inference in 
the conclusion at all and if the natural conclusion even though true 
were drawn that all planets move round the sun c then there would 
be inferred in the conclusion what was not involved in the premises a con 
tradiction which th deductive logicians have never yet cleared up it is 
evident therefore that the worthy prelate has entirely misapprehended the 
legitimate province of logic uad he taken more into consideration the 
generalizing element in the human judgment he would not have fallen into 
this egregious error as has been already observed all planets move 
round the sun c would have been the natural inference but this as 
the learned prelate observes would have been false so it would just as 
false in inference as your lordships logical theory is false in principle 
a nd besides if any attempt be made to reduce the inductive to the deduc 
tive it is only by assuming from the particular facts a generalized conclusion 
though the use of the assumption is not admitted he worthy prelate in 



 slemektaby treatise 

such an attempt can only be compared to the boy who pretended to throw 
a rope from the gromid through an aperture at the top of a steeple whe 
he at the same time innocently and unconsciously made use of a convenient 
ladder in order to effect his purpose it is no less amusing to see how 
mr leechman who may be viewed in the light of a logical chaplain to the 
learned archbishop makes use of the same ladder which might be termed 
the ladder of generalization in page of lus very useful work on 
logic he says that induction a process of enquiry that it is by 
investigation that premises are obtained now is it by investigation or 
enquiry that we obtain the major premise of the following syllogism — 

all men are mortal 
john is a man therefore 
john is mortal 



in the same page after stating that the legitimate province of logic is 
exclusively connected with the reasoning process or the drawing of conclu 
sions he goes on to state that this process must therefore ever remain a 
distinct operation from the collecting of facts or the ladng down of pre 
mises are we to understand from this mr leechman that collecting of 
facts or laying down premises are one and the same operation to collect 
facts is one thing to lay down premises quite another thing observation 
and experience give the facts induction generalizes them or supplies the 
premises i cannot help quoting the following passage from the succeeding 
page but if we look at the other process which takes place in induction 
that of deducing inferences from the facts already obtained by observation 
and experiment we shall find that this is a process of reasoning capable of 
being syllogistically expressed it would appear from this that mr 
leechman includes under the head of induction the investigating and 
generalizing processes the latter of which is capable of being syllogis 
tically stated and that we are in such cases employing a syllogism 
in barbara with the major premise suppressed for example the 
approach of a hot body increases heat according to the degree of nearness 
and the case is the same with light for the nearer an object is placed to the 
light the more visible it becomes the first is thus syllogistically stated 

bar whatever belongs to these particular instances belongs to that class 

in which they are included 
ha in these particular instances the nearer the approach of a hot body 

the greater is the degree of heat therefore 
ra in all instances the approach of a hot body increases heat according 

to the degree of nearness 

now i should uke to see mr leechman reconcile the sixth general rule 
for the construction of syllogisms with his minor premise and the conclusion 
drawn from it for pray how can all instances be inferred from these 
particular instances upon the syllogistic principle that nothing can be 
inferred in the conclusion which was not previously admitted in the premises 
in the first place he generalizes in the major premise but giving this 
advantage the minor and conclusion can never be reconciled to the aris 
totelian dictum it must be obvious that the minor of the syllogism is a 



on logic 

particular proposition clothed in a verbiage of words to deceive the judg 
ment the sixth general rule of the construction of syllogisms is that if 
one of the premises be particular the conclusion must be particular in 
the above we have a particular minor and a general conclusion if this be 
denied then let it be shown how the minor of the above syllogism involves 
the conclusion 

the next writer who merits attention and who stands preeminently con 
nected with this science is mr mill it is hardly possible however to 
get at this writers real or definite opinions for in his anxious endeavours 
to reconcile the friends and foes of the syllogism he proceeds unsparingly 
to the work of demolition on the one hand and of reconciliation on the 
other if he has any definite views at all they appear to be that all 
reasoning s from particulars to particulars take for example the following 
syllogism — 

all men are mortal 

the duke of wellington is a man therefore 

the duke is mortal 

but how mr mill asks do we get the general conclusion that all men 
are mortal we conclude says he from the death of john thomas 
and co or any other person we have heard of that the duke of 
wellington is mortal like the rest 

induction 

john thomas and co are mortal 
these are men therefore 
all men are mortal 

deduction 

all men are mortal 

the duke is a man therefore 

the duke is mortal 

but says mr mill the inference is not in the deductive process for 
when we infer that all men are mortal we include wellington among the 
rest in the deductive process it is but a deciphering of our notes 
mr mill would have us therefore take a short cut and not travel on the 
high road of generalization at sjl in fact he would have us infer that 
because john thomas and co are mortal therefore the duke is mortal 
without noticing the contradiction in which mr mill involves himself here 
in reference to his previous statement that when we inferred that all men 
are mortal we include the duke among the rest it may be asked can we 
have inference at all in many cases without a previous process of general 
ization i apprehend not for though the particular facts be the ultimate 
basis of otu major premise as the gold in the bank of england is the 
ultimate basis of its credit for the notes issued we must generalize before 
we can infer anything of these particular facts except what is true of these 
facts themselves let us take the example given by mr mill himself — 

john thomas and co are mortal therefore 
the duke is mortal 



 elementary treatise on logic 

but it will appear abvious upon the slightest reflection that we cannot 
infer from john thomas and co the mortality of the duke all that 
we can infer or decipher is simply the mortality of john thomas or any 
other individual of that co for instance 

john thomas and co are mortal these are men therefore 

john is mortal or 

thomas is mortal or 

any other person of the said co is mortal 

we cannot decipher from our notes what is not in them this can 
only be done from notes in which the duke is included from this it is 
obvious that there can be no inference in many cases without a preceding 
act of generalization either assumed or expressed it is rather singular 
that mr mill who is probably one of the first metaphysicians of the age 
should have overlooked the natural frmctions of one of the primary elements 
of human nature in conclusion however it may be observed that no 
student of logic should be without his masterly production on that science

ecwiomist

 its principles remain the same as of yore though enforced with for more vigour — 
observer 

 distinguished by high literaiy ability and a tone of fearless and truthful discussion 
which is fiiu of promise for the future — wly news 

 the variety and ability of the articles are great and the general tone of the review 
is unequivocally the expression of matured thought and earnest and devated con 
victions — inquirer 

 we congratulate mr chapman on the high tone and spirit of superior enterprise 
manifest in the review — cowrt jowmol 



the westminster review is designed as an instrament for the 
development and guidance of earnest thought on politics social philosophy 
religion and general literature and is the organ bf the most able and 
independent minds of the day 

the fundamental principle of the work is the recognition of the law 
of progress in conformity with this principle and with the consequent 
conviction that attempts at reform — though modified by the experience of 
the past and the ctmditions of the present — should be directed and 
animated by an advancing ideal the editors seek to maintain a steady 
comparison of the actual with the possible as the most powerful stimulus 
to improvement nevertheless in the deliberate advocacy of organic 



the westminster review 

changes it will not be forgotten that the institutions of man no less than 
the products of nature are strong and durable in proportion as they are 
the results of a gradual devdopment and that the most salutary and 
permanent reforms are those which while embodring the wisdom of the 
time yet sustain such a relation to the moral and intellectual condition of 
the people as to ensure their support 

in contradistinction to the practical infidelity and essentially destruc 
tive policy which would ignore the existence of widespread doubts in 
relation to established creeds and systems and would stifle all inquiry 
dangerous to prescriptive claims the review exhibits that untemporizing 
expression of opinion and that fearlessness of investigation and criticism 
which are the results of a consistent faith in the ultimate prevalence of truth 

aware that the same fundamental truths are apprehended under a 
variety of forms and that therefore opposing systems may in the end 
prove complements of each other the editors endeavour to institute such 
a radical and comprehensive treatment of those controverted questions 
which are practically momentous as may aid in the conciliation of divergent 
views in furtherance of this object a limited portion of the work under 
the head of independent contributions is set apart for the reception of 
articles ably setting forth opinions which though not discrepant with the 
general spirit of the review may be at variance with the particular ideas or 
measures it will advocate the primary object of this department is to 
facilitate the expression of opinion by men of high mental power and 
culture who while they are zealous friends of freedom and progress yet 
differ widely on special points of great practical concern both from the 
editors and from each other 

the review gives especial attention to that wide range of topics which 
may be included under the term social philosophy it endeavours to form 
a dispassionate estimate of the diverse theories on these subjects to give 
a deflnite and intelligible form to the chaotic mass of thought now preva 
lent concerning them and to ascertain both in what degree the popular 
efforts after a more perfect social state are countenanced by the teachings 
of politicoeconomical science and how far they may be sustained and 
promoted by the actut j character and culture of the people 

in the department of politics careful consideration is given to all the 
most vital questions without regard to the distinctions of party the only 
standard of consistency to which the editors adhere being uie real and not 
the accidental relations of measures — their bearing not on a ministry or 
a class but on the public good 

in the treatment of religious questions the review unites a spirit of 
reverential sympathy for the cherished associations of pure and elevated 
minds with an uncompromising pursuit of truth the elements of ecclesi 
astical authority and of dogma are fearlessly examined and the results of 
the most advanced biblical criticism are discussed without reservation 
under the conviction that religion has its foundation in mans nature and 
will only discard an old form to assume and vitalize one more expressive 
of its essence while however the editors do not shrink from the ex 
pression of what they believe to be sound negative views they equally 
bear in mind the preeminent importance of a constructive religious phi 
losophy as connected with the development and activity of the moral

nature and of those poetic and emotional elements out of which proceed 
our noblest aspirations and the essential beauty of life 

in the department of general literature the criticism is animated bj 
the desire to elevate the standard of the public taste in relation both to 
artistic perfection and moral purity larger space is afforded for articles 
intrinsically valuable by the omission of those minor and miscellaneous 
notices which are necessarily forestalled by newspapers and magazines and 
equivalent information is given in a single article showing the course of 
literary production during each preceding quarter the foreign section of 
the review is also condensed into an historical survey of the novelties in 
continental and american literature which have appeared in the same 
interval

the prospective review is devoted to a free theology and the 
moral aspects of literature under the conviction that lingering influences 
from the doctrine of verbal inspiration are not only depriving the primitive 
records of the gospel of their true interpretation but even destroying fsmh 
in christianity itself tlie work is conducted in the confidence that only a 
living mind and heart not in bondage to any letter can receive the living 
spirit of revelation and in the fervent belief that for all such there is a true 
gospel of god which no critical or historical speculation can discredit or 
destroy it aims to interpret and represent spiritual christianity in its 
character of the universal religion fully adopting the sentiment of 
coleridge that the exercise of the reasoning and reflective powers 
increasing insight and enlarging views are requisite to keep ahve the 
substantial faith of the heart — with a grateful appreciation of the labours 
of faithful predecessors of all churches — it esteems it the part of a true 
reverence not to rest in their conclusions but to think and live in their 
spirit by the name pkospective review it is intended to lay no 
claim to discovery but simply to express the desire and the attitvde pf 
progress to suggest continually the duty of using past and present as a 
trust for the future and openly to disown the idolatrous conservatism of 
whatever sect which makes christianity but a lifeless formula

 it is highly ereditiie to mr chapman to find his name in connexion with so much welldirected 
enterprise in the cause of german literature and philosophy he is the first publisher who eeeme to 
have proposed to himself the worthy object of introducing the english reader to the philosophic 
mind of germany uninfluenced by the tradesmans distrust of the marketable nature of the ardele 
it is a very praiseworthy ambition and we trust the public will justify his confidence nothing 
could be more unworthy than the attempt to disoonrsge and indeed punish such unselfish enterprise 
by attaching a bad reputation for orthodoxy to everything connected with german philosophy and 
theology this is especially unworthy in the student or the scholar to borrow fichtes names
