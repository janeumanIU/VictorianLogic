my dear sedgwick 

when i showed you the last sheet of my history of the in 
ductive sciences in its transit through the press you told me that 
i ought to add a paragraph or two at the end by way of moral 
to the story and i replied that the moral would be as long as 
the story itself the present work ihe moral which you then 
desired i have with some effort reduced within a somewhat 
smaller compass than i then spoke of and i cannot dedicate it 
to any one with so much pleasure as to you 

it has always been my wish that as far and as long as men 
might know anything of me by my writings they should hear of me 
along with the friends with whom i have lived whom i have loved 
and by whose conversation i have been animated to hope that i 
too might add something to the literature of our country there 
is no one whose name has on such grounds a better claim than 
yours to stand in the front of a work which has been the subject 
of my labours for no small portion of our long period of friend 
ship but there is another reason which gives a peculiar pro 
priety to this dedication of my philosophy to you i have little 
doubt that if your life had not been absorbed in struggling 
with many of the most difficult problems of a difficult science 
you would have been my fellowlabourer or master in the work 
which i have here undertaken the same spirit which dictated 
your vigorous protest against some of the errors which i also 
attempt to expose would have led you if your thoughts had been 
more free to take a leading share in that reform of philosophy 

a 



 



iv dedication 

which all who are alive to such errors must see to be now indis 
pensable to you i may most justly inscribe a work which con 
tains a criticism of the fallacies of the ultralockian school 

i will mention one other reason which enters into the satisfac 
tion with which i place your name at the head of my philosophy 
by doing so i may consider myself as dedicating it to the college 
to which we both belong to which we both owe so much of all 
that we are and in which we have lived together so long andso 
happily and that be it remembered the college of bacon and of 
newton that college i know holds a strong place in your affec 
tions as in mine and among many reasons not least on this 
account we believe that sound and enduring philosophy ever 
finds there a congenial soil and a fostering shelter if the doc 
trines which the present work contains be really true and valu 
able my unhesitating trust is that they will spread gradually 
from these precincts to every part of the land 

that this office of being the fosterer and diffuser of truth may 
ever belong to our common nursing mother and that you my 
dear sdgvvick may long witness and contribute to these bene 
ficial influences is the hearty wish of 

yours affectionately

preface 



the work now before the reader is intended as an 
application of the plan of bacons novum organum to 
the present condition of physical science the progress 
of such science during the last three centuries has given 
us the means of inquiring with advantages which former 
generations did not possess what that organ or intellec 
tual method is by which solid truth is to be extracted 
from the observation of nature and though the attempt 
to discover this cannot but be an arduous undertaking it 
is so plainly required of the present generation that any 
one engaging in it with sobriety and industry may claim 
to have his labours soberly and tolerantly estimated i 
shall therefore make no apology for what might otherwise 
appear the presumption of such a design my scheme is 
however narrower than bacons in this respect that i 
have in the present work confined myself to those 
branches of human knowledge which have external 
nature for their object and are often exclusively termed 
sciences the reason given for this limitation in the 
following pages namely that it seemed proper to collect 
our philosophy of knowledge from the most certain and 
distinct portions of knowledge alone will i trust be 
considered as an adequate justification of the course 
pursued 

vol i b 



x preface 

many writers both before and since bacon have 
employed themselves upon the subjects with which we 
are here concerned the philosophy of knowledge and 
the methods of arriving at science and i have availed 
myself of their conclusions where they appeared to be real 
additions to sound philosophy i must add that i have 
not scrupled to subject their speculations to a critical 
examination and to reject all that was thus found to be 
erroneous or worthless a system which professes to give 
a view of the nature of knowledge supplies canons of 
criticism by which all other philosophical doctrines must 
be tried in order to determine their import and reality 
it is an office essentially connected with the exposition of 
such a system to pronounce on the value of previous 
essays of the same kind hence i have not hesitated 
on some occasions to dissent from the great masters of 
the philosophy of science from bacon from cuvier and 
even from newton himself believing that they upon 
maturer consideration would have been led to those doc 
trines and precepts which i have preferred to theirs in 
like manner although i have adopted kants reasoning 
respecting the nature of space and time it will be found 
by any one acquainted with the system of that acute 
metaphysician that my views differ widely from his i 
have also ventured to condemn some of the opinions 
respecting physical philosophy published by another emi 
nent german writer schelling to whose works i have in 
other subjects great obligations 

the present work was announced in the outset of a 



preface xi 

history of the inductive sciences which was published three 
years ago that history was indeed the result of labours 
undertaken with a view to the formation of a pjiilosophy 
of science and was intended from the first as an intro 
duction to a work on that subject i may therefore take 
the liberty of saying that i have as yet seen no reason to 
wish to make any material change in the history as it is 
now before the world i will not omit this opportunity 
of expressing my obligations to the german translator of 
the history it is a testimony which may well give an 
author some confidence in the value of his work that 
one of the most eminent men of science in europe should 
spontaneously postpone other tasks in order to give it 
with the most flattering expressions to the public of his 
own country i may add that a review of my history 
which has appeared in our own language has tended in 
no small degree to convince me that the work contains 
few material errors and none which are of any importance 
with regard to its general scope the reviewer ob 
viously an enemy eager to find faults was able to detect 
but very few passages which are really mistakes f 

other critics have made objections of various kinds to 

 the history of the inductive sciences has been translated into 
german by m yon littrow director of tlie imperial observatory at 
vienna and author of many wellknown mathematical works 

t see edinburgh review no cxxxiii p also no cxxxvi p 
 but i am compelled by justice to acknowledge that the value of 
this testimony is materially weakened by the reviewers extreme laxity 
and obscurity of view with regard to the nature of science defects 
which make his judgment on such subjects nearly worthless 

b 



xll preface 

that part of the history which relates to physiology but 
none which it is necessary to notice here i regret that 
my plan should again lead me in the present work to 
trespass upon the domain of the physiologists those who 
have well studied that subject feel a persuasion a very 
natural and just one that nothing less than a life profes 
sionally devoted to the science can entitle a person to 
decide the still controverted questions which it involves 
and hence they look with a reasonable jealousy upon 
attempts to discuss such questions made by a lay specu 
lator i trust it will be found that i have not in the 
present work asserted any opinions on such subjects with 
out alleging sufficient reasons such discussions as i 
have introduced appeared to me to be requisite to com 
plete the philosophy of science the value of the opinions 
thus delivered it must be left to physiologists present 
and future to decide 

in writing the history i was led on several occasions 
to pass on from the facts to the lessons of philosophy which 
they suggest i have now in three or four instances 
taken the liberty of restoring reflections so made to their 
proper place by incorporating a few phrases or here 
and there a sentence from the history in the present 
work i think it right to mention this that those who 
read both works may not deem me guilty of careless 
repetition 

perhaps i shall be charged with having employed the 
term idea in an unusual manner in these pages almost 
every writer who has introduced that term into his spe 



preface xiii 

dilations has been accused by succeeding critics of 
some degree of vagueness and vacillation in its use the 
mode in which i have applied it appears to me very defi 
nite the grounds of the universal and necessary truths 
which we are able to assert in various departments of 
knowledge reside in certain general forms of apprehen 
sion or relations of our conceptions as space time 
cause and these i term ideas or when ambiguity is to 
be guarded against fundamental ideas if i could have 
found any other word or phrase which in common usage 
came nearer to this meaning i should have been glad to 
adopt it i have employed the word conception to ex 
press that which is i think its common signification 
our conceptions are that in the mind which we denote by 
our general terms as a triangle a square number 
a force but still this term in the present work implies 
principles which have not been employed at least not 
commonly by previous writers for in the course of my 
speculations i am further led to speak of such concep 
tions as modifications of our fundamental ideas and as 
deriving from the ideas their power of leading to uni 
versal and necessary truths in instances in which no 
obscurity appeared likely to arise i may perhaps occa 
sionally have employed the terms idea conception 
notion and others with less discrimination 

bacons purpose and promise was that his new organ 
should produce material as well as intellectual profit 
works as well as knowledge that the study of the 
order of nature does add to mans power the history of 



xiv preface 

the sciences since bacon has abundantly shown but 
though this hope of derivative advantages may stimulate 
our exertions it cannot govern our methods of seeking 
knowledge without leading us away from the most gene 
ral and genuine forms of knowledge the nature of 
knowledge must be studied in itself and for its own sake 
before we attempt to learn what external rewards it will 
bring us i have therefore not aimed at imitating bacon 
in those parts of his work in which he contemplates the 
increase of mans dominion over nature as the main 
object of natural philosophy being fully persuaded that 
if bacon himself had had unfolded before him the great 
theories which have been established since his time he 
would have acquiesced in the contemplation of them 
and would have readily proclaimed the real reason for 
aiming at the knowledge of such truths to be that they 
are true thus i have ventured to separate his first 
aphorism into two to consider the interpretation as our 
primary object not the ministration tlie knowing not the 
doing the intelligence not the power 

the mode of delivering the philosophy of science in 
aphorisms which bacon has adopted would not well suf 
fice for the treatment of the subject at present since 
many questions must be discussed many perplexities ex 
plained no writer upon such subjects can expect to be 
either understood or assented to beyond the limits of a 

 homo naturae minister et interpres tantum facit et intelligit 
quantum de naturae ordine re vel mente observaverit nee amplius scit 
aut potest 



preface xv 

narrow school who is not prepared with good arguments 
as w r ell as magisterial decisions upon the many obscure 
and controverted points which the subject brings before 
him but though an aphoristic philosophy unsupported 
by reasoning is thus unsuited to the time it may be satis 
factory to many readers to see the philosophy to which in 
the present work we are led presented in the aphoristic 
form i have therefore expressed in aphorisms a large 
part of the doctrines resulting from the discussions which 
occupy the following pages these aphorisms are given 
at the end of this preface 

along with these i shall add some other aphorisms 
on the subject of the language of science a subject in 
which it appears to be time to collect from the usage of 
the most judicious writers some rules which may tend to 
preserve the purity and analogies of scientific language 
from wanton and needless violation as this subject is 
not discussed in the work itself i have given along with 
these aphorisms such examples as may tend to confirm 
and illustrate them and have applied them to some cases 
at present unsettled 



aphorisms concerning ideas 



i 

man is the interpreter of nature science the right interpre 
tation 

ii 

the senses place before us the characters of the book of 
nature but these convey no knowledge to us till we have dis 
covered the alphabet by which they are to be read 

iii 

the alphabet by means of which we interpret phenomena 
consists of the ideas existing in our own minds for these give to 
the phenomena that coherence and significance which is not an 
object of sense 

iv 

the antithesis of sense and ideas is the foundation of the 
philosophy of science no knowledge can exist without the 
union no philosophy without the separation of these two ele 
ments 

v 

fact and theory correspond to sense on the one hand and to 
ideas on the other so far as we are conscious of our ideas but 
all facts involve ideas unconsciously and thus the distinction of 
facts and theories is not tenable as that of sense and ideas is 

vi 

sensations and ideas in our knowledge are like matter and 
form in bodies matter cannot exist without form nor form 



xv aphorisms 

without matter yet the two are altogether distinct and opposite 
there is no possibility either of separating or of confounding 
them the same is the case with sensations and ideas 

vii 

ideas are not transformed but formed sensations for with 
out ideas sensations have no form 

viii 

the sensations are the objective the ideas the subjective part 
of every act of perception or knowledge 

ix 

general terms denote ideal conceptions as a circle an orbit 
a rose these are not images of real things as was held by the 
realists but conceptions yet they are conceptions not bound 
together by mere name as the nominalists held but by an idea 

x 

it has been said by some that all conceptions are merely 
states or feelings of the mind but this assertion only tends to con 
found what it is our business to distinguish 

xi 

observed facts are connected so as to produce new truths by 
superinducing upon them an idea and such truths are obtained 
by induction 

xii 

truths once obtained by legitimate induction are facts 
these facts may be again connected so as to produce higher truths 
and thus we advance to successive generalizations 

xiii 

truths obtained by induction are made compact and perma 
nent by being expressed in technical terms 



concerning ideas 



xiv 

experience cannot conduct us to universal and necessary 
truths not to universal because she has not tried all cases 
not to necessary because necessity is not a matter to which expe 
rience can testify 

xv 

necessary truths derive their necessity from the ideas which 
they involve and the existence of necessary truths proves the 
existence of ideas not generated by experience 

xvi 

in deductive reasoning we cannot have any truth in the 
conclusion which is not virtually contained in the premises 

xvii 

in order to acquire any exact and solid knowledge the student 
must possess with perfect precision the ideas appropriate to that 
part of knowledge and this precision is tested by the students 
perceiving the axiomatic evidence of the axioms belonging to each 
fundamental idea 

xviii 

the fundamental ideas which it is most important to con 
sider as being the bases of the material sciences are the ideas 
of space time including number cause including force and 
matter outness of objects and media of perception of secondary 
qualities polarity contrariety chemical composition and 
affinity substance likeness and natural affinity means and 
ends whence the notion of organization symmetry and the 
ideas of vital poicers 

xix 

the sciences which depend upon the ideas of space and 
number are pure sciences not inductive sciences they do not 
infer special theories from facts but deduce the conditions of all 
theory from ideas the elementary pure sciences or elemen 
tary mathematics are geometry theoretical arithmetic and 
algebra 



xx aphorisms 



xx 

the ideas on which the pure sciences depend are those of 
space and number but number is a modification of the concep 
tion of repetition which belongs to the idea of time 

xxi 

the idea of space is not derived from experience for expe 
rience of external objects presupposes bodies to exist in space 
space is a condition under which the mind receives the impres 
sions of sense and therefore the relations of space are necessarily 
and universally true of all perceived objects space is a form of 
our perceptions and regulates them whatever the matter of them 
may be 

xxii 

space is not a general notion collected by abstraction from 
particular cases for we do not speak of spaces in general but of 
universal or absolute space absolute space is infinite all 
special spaces are in absolute space and are parts of it 

xxiii 

space is not a real object or thing distinct from the objects 
which exist in it but it is a real condition of the existence of 
external objects 

xxiv 

we have an intuition of objects in space that is we con 
template objects as made up of spatial parts and apprehend their 
spatial relations by the same act by which we apprehend the 
objects themselves 

xxv 

form or figure is space limited by boundaries space has 
necessarily three dimensions length breadth depth and no 
ethers which cannot be resolved into these 



concerning ideas xxi 



xxvi 

the idea of space is exhibited for scientific purposes by the 
definitions and axioms of geometry such for instance as 
these the definition of a right angle and of a circle the 
definition of parallel lines and the axiom concerning them 
the axiom that two straight lines cannot inclose a space these 
definitions are necessary not arbitrary and the axioms are 
needed as well as the definitions in order to express the neces 
sary conditions which the idea of space imposes 

xxvii 

the definitions and axioms of elementary geometry do not 
completely exhibit the idea of space in proceeding to the 
higher geometry we may introduce other additional and inde 
pendent axioms such as that of archimedes that a curve line 
uhich joins tic o points is less than any broken line joining the same 
points and including the curve line 

xxviii 

the perception of a solid object by sight requires that act of 
mind by which from figure and shade we infer distance and 
position in space the perception of figure by sight requires that 
act of mind by which we give an outline to each object 

xxix 

the perception of form by touch is not an impression on the 
passive sense but requires an act of our muscular frame by which 
we become aware of the position of our own limbs the percep 
tive faculty involved in this act has been called the muscular sense 

xxx 

the idea of time is not derived from experience for expe 
rience of changes jovsupposes occurrences to take place in time 
time is a condition under which the mind receives the impres 
sions of sense and therefore the relations of tine are necessarily 



xxh aphorisms 

and universally true of all perceived occurrences time is a form 
of our perceptions and regulates them whatever the matter of 
them may be 

xxxi 

time is not a general notion collected by abstraction from 
particular cases for we do not speak of particular times as 
examples of time in general but as parts of a single and infinite 
time 

xxxii 

time like space is a form not only of perception but of 
intuition we consider the whole of any time as equal to the 
sum of the parts and an occurrence as coinciding with the por 
tion of time which it occupies 

xxxiii 

time is analogous to space of one dimension portions of 
both have a beginning and an end are long or short there is 
nothing in time which is analogous to space of two or of three 
dimensions and thus nothing which corresponds to figure 

xxxiv 

the repetition of a set of occurrences as for example strong 
and weak or long and short sounds according to a steadfast order 
produces rhythm which is a conception peculiar to time as 
figure is to space 

xxxv 

the simplest form of repetition is that in which there is no 
variety and this gives rise to the conception of number 

xxxvi 

the simplest numerical truths are seen by intuition when 
we endeavour to deduce the more complex from these simplest 
we employ such maxims as these if equals be added to equah 
the wholes are equal if equals be subtracted from equals the 
remainders are equal the whole is equal to the sum of all its parts 



concerning ideas xxili 



xxxvii 

the perception of time involves a constant and latent kind 
of memory which may be termed a sense of succession the 
perception of number also involves this sense of succession 
although in small numbers we appear to apprehend the units 
simultaneously and not successively 

xxxviii 

the perception of rhythm is not an impression on the pas 
sive sense but requires an act of thought by which we connect 
and group the strokes which form the rhythm 

xxxix 

intuitive is opposed to discursive reason in intuition we 
obtain our conclusions by dwelling upon one aspect of the funda 
mental idea in discursive reasoning we combine several aspects 
of the idea that is several axioms and reason from the combi 
nation 

xl 

geometrical deduction and deduction in general is called 
synthesis because we introduce at successive steps the results of 
new principles but in reasoning on the relations of space we 
sometimes go on separating truths into their component truths 
and these into other component truths and so on and this is 
geometrical analysis 

xli 

among the foundations of the higher mathematics is the 
idea of symbols considered as general signs of quantity this 
idea of a sign is distinct from and independent of other ideas 
the axiom to which we refer in reasoning by means of symbols 
of quantity is this the interpretation of such symbols must be 
perfectly general this idea and axiom are the bases of algebra 
in its most general form 



xxiv aphorisms 

xlii 

among the foundations of the higher mathematics is also 
the idea of a limit the idea of a limit cannot be superseded 
by any other definitions or hypotheses the axiom which we 
employ in introducing this idea into our reasoning is this 
what is true up to the limit is true at the limit this idea and 
axiom are the bases of all methods of limits fluxions diffe 
rentials variations and the like 

xliii 

there is a pure science of motion which does not depend 
upon observed facts but upon the idea of motion it may 
also be termed pure mechanism in opposition to mechanics 
proper or machinery which involves the mechanical conceptions 
of force and matter it has been proposed to name this pure 
science of motion kinematics 

xliv 

the pure mathematical sciences must be successfully culti 
vated in order that the progress of the principal inductive sciences 
may take place this appears in the case of astronomy in 
which science both in ancient and in modern times each advance 
of the theory has depended upon the previous solution of problems 
in pure mathematics it appears also inversely in the science of 
the tides in which at present we cannot advance in the theory 
because we cannot solve the requisite problems in the integral 
calculus 

xlv 

the idea of cause modified into the conceptions of mecha 
nical cause or force and resistance to force or matter is the 
foundation of the mechanical sciences that is mechanics 
including statics and dynamics hydrostatics and physical 
astronomy 

xlvi 

the idea of cause is not derived from experience for in 
judging of occurrences which we contemplate we consider them 



concerning ideas xxv 

as being universally and necessarily causes and effects which 
a finite experience could not authorize us to do the axiom 
that every event must have a cause is true independently of 
experience and beyond the limits of experience 

xlvii 

the idea of cause is expressed for purposes of science by 
these three axioms every event must have a cause causes 
are measured by their effects reaction is equal and opposite to 
action 

xlviit 

the conception of force involves the idea of cause as applied 
to the motion and rest of bodies the conception of force is 
suggested by muscular action exerted the conception of matter 
arises from muscular action resisted we necessarily ascribe to 
all bodies solidity and inertia since we conceive matter as that 
which cannot be compressed or moved without resistance 

xlix 

mechanical science depends on the conception of force 
and is divided into statics the doctrine of force preventing 
motion and dynamics the doctrine of force producing motion 

l 

the science of statics depends upon the axiom that action 
and reaction are equal which in statics assumes this form 
when two equal weights are supported on the middle point 
between them the pressure on the fulcrum is equal to the sum of the 
weights 

li 

the science of hydrostatics depends upon the fundamental 
principle that fluids press equally in all directions this prin 
ciple necessarily results from the conception of a fluid as a body 
of which the parts are perfectly moveable in all directions for 
since the fluid is a body it can transmit pressure and the trans 
mitted pressure is equal to the original pressure in virtue of the 
vol i c 



xxvi aphorisms 

axiom that reaction is equal to action that the fundamental 
principle is not derived from experience is plain both from its 
evidence and from its history 

lii 

the science of dynamics depends upon the three axioms 
above stated respecting cause the first axiom that every 
change must have a cause gives rise to the first law of 
motion that a body not acted upon by a force will move with a 
uniform velocity in a straight line the second axiom that 
causes are measured by their effects gives rise to the second 
law of motion that when a force acts upon a body in motion 
the effect of the force is compounded with the previously existing 
motion the third axiom that reaction is equal and opposite 
to action gives rise to the third law of motion which is 
expressed in the same terms as the axiom action and reaction 
being understood to signify momentum gained and lost 

liii 

the above laws of motion historically speaking were esta 
blished by means of experiment but since they have been dis 
covered and reduced to their simplest form they have been con 
sidered by many philosophers as selfevident this result is 
principally due to the introduction and establishment of terms 
and definitions which enable us to express the laws in a very 
simple manner 

liv 

in the establishment of the laws of motion it happened in 
several instances that principles were assumed as selfevident 
which do not now appear evident but which have since been de 
monstrated from the simplest and most evident principles thus 
it was assumed that a perpetual motion is impossible that the 
velocities of bodies acquired by falling down planes or curves of the 
same vertical height are equal that the actual descent of the 
centre of gravity is equal to its potential ascent but we are not 
hence to suppose that these assumptions were made without 
ground for since they really follow from the laws of motion 



concerning ideas xxvll 

they were probably in the minds of the discoverers the results 
of undeveloped demonstrations which their sagacity led them to 
divine 

lv 

it is a paradox that experience should lead us to truths con 
fessedly universal and apparently necessary such as the laws of 
motion are the solution of his paradox is that these laws are 
interpretations of the axioms of causation the axioms are 
universally and necessarily true but the right interpretation of 
the terms which they involve is learnt by experience our 
idea of cause supplies the form experience the matter of these 
laws

primary qualities of bodies are those which we can con 
ceive as directly perceived secondary qualities are those which 
we conceive as perceived by means of a medium 

lvii 

we necessarily perceive bodies as without us the idea of 
externality is one of the conditions of perception 

lviii 

we necessarily assume a medium for the perceptions of light 
colour sound heat odours tastes and this medium must 
convey impressions by means of its mechanical attributes 

lix 

secondary qualities are not extended but intensive their 
effects are not augmented by addition of parts but by increased 
operation of the medium hence they are not measured directly 
but by scales not by units but by degrees 

lx 

in the scales of secondary qualities it is a condition in 
order that the scale may be complete that every example of the 
quality must either agree with one of the degrees of the scale 
or lie between two contiguous degrees

lxi 

we perceive by means of a medium and by means of impres 
sions on the nerves but we do not by our senses perceive 
either the medium or the impressions on the nerves 

lxii 



the prerogatives of the sight are that by this sense we neces 
sarily and immediately apprehend the position of its objects and 
that from visible circumstances we infer the distance of objects 
from us so readily that we seem to perceive and not to infer 

lxiii 

the prerogatives of the hearing are that by this sense we 
perceive relations perfectly precise and definite between two notes 
namely musical intervals as an octave a fifth and that when 
two notes are perceived together they are apprehended as dis 
tinct a chord and as having a certain relation concord or 
discord 

lxiv 

the sight cannot decompose a compound colour into simple 
colours or distinguish a compound from a simple colour the 
hearing cannot directly perceive the place still less the distance 
of its objects we infer these obscurely and vaguely from 
audible circumstances 

lxv 

the first paradox of vision is that we see objects upright 
though the images on the retina are inverted the solution is 
that we do not see the image on the retina at all we only see by 
means of it 

lxvl 

the second paradox of vision is that we see objects single 
though there are two images on the retinas one in each eye 
the explanation is that it is a law of vision that we see small 
or distant objects single when their images fall on corresponding 
points of the two retinas 



concerning ideas xxix 

lxvil 

the law of single vision for near objects is this when the 
two images in the two eyes are situated part for part nearly but 
not exactly upon corresponding points the object is apprehended 
as single and solid if the two images are such as would be pro 
duced by a single solid object seen by the eyes separately 

lxviii 

the ultimate object of each of the secondary mechanical 
sciences is to determine the nature and laws of the processes by 
which the impression of the secondary quality treated of is con 
veyed but before we discover the cause it may be necessary to 
determine the laws of the phenomena and for this purpose a 
measure or scale of each quality is necessary 

lxix 

secondary qualities are measured by means of such effects as 
can be estimated in number or space 

lxx 

the measure of sounds as high or low is the musical scale 
or harmonic canon 

lxxi 

the measures of pure colours are the prismatic scale the 
same including fraunhofer s lines and newtons scale of colours 
the principal scales of impure colours are werners nomencla 
ture of colours and merimees nomenclature of colours 

lxxii 

the idea of polarity involves the conception of contrary pro 
perties in contrary directions the properties being for example 
attraction and repulsion darkness and light synthesis and analy 
sis and the contrary directions being those which are directly 
opposite or in some cases those which are at right angles

coexistent polarities are fundamentally identical 

lxxiv 

the idea of chemical affinity as implied in elementary 
composition involves peculiar conceptions it is not properly 
expressed by assuming the qualities of bodies to resemble those of 
the elements or to depend on the figure of the elements or on 
their attractions 

lxxv 

attractions take place between bodies affinities between the 
particles of a body the former may be compared to the alli 
ances of states the latter to the ties of family 

lxxvi 

the governing principles of chemical affinity are that it is 
elective that it is definite that it determines the properties of the 
compound and that analysis is possible 

lxxvii 

we have an idea of substance and an axiom involved in this 
idea is that the weight of a body is the sum of the weights of all its 



lxxviii 

hence imponderable fluids are not to be admitted as che 
mical elements 

lxxix 

the doctrine of atoms is admissible as a mode of expressing 
and calculating laws of nature but is not proved by any fact 
chemical or physical as a philosophical truth 

lxxx 

we have an idea of symmetry and an axiom involved in this 
idea is that in a symmetrical natural body if there be a ten 
dency to modify any member in any manner there is a tendency 
to modify all the corresponding members in the same manner 



concerning ideas xxxi 



lxxxi 

all hypotheses respecting the manner in which the elements 
of inorganic bodies are arranged in space must be constructed 
with regard to the general facts of crystallization 

lxxxii 

when we consider any object as one we give unity to it by 
an act of thought the condition which determines what this 
unity shall include and what it shall exclude isthis that asser 
tions concerning the one thing shall be possible 

lxxxiii 

we collect individuals into kinds by applying to them the 
idea of likeness kinds of things are not determined by defini 
tions but by this condition that general assertions concerning 
such kinds of things shall be possible 

lxxxiv 

the names of kinds of things are governed by their use and 
that may be a right name in one use which is not so in another 
a whale is not a fish in natural history but it is a fish in com 
merce and law 

lxxxv 

we take for granted that each kind of things has a special 
character which may be expressed by a definition the ground 
of our assumption is this that reasoning must be possible 

lxxxvi 

the five words genus species difference property acci 
dent were used by the aristotelians in order to express the sub 
ordination of kinds and to describe the nature of definitions and 
propositions in modern times these technical expressions have 
been more referred to by natural historians than by metaphy 
sicians

lxxxvii 

the construction of a classificatory science includes termi 
nology the formation of a descriptive language diataxis the 
plan of the system of classification called also the systematic 
diagnosis the scheme of the characters by which the different 
classes are known called also the characteristic physiography 
is the knowledge which the system is employed to convey 
diataxis includes nomenclature 

lxxxviii 

terminology must be conventional precise constant copious 
in words and minute in distinctions according to the needs of 
the science the student must understand the terms directly 
according to the convention not through the medium of explana

lxxxix 

the diataxis or plan of the system may aim at a natural 
or an artificial system but no classes can be absolutely arti 
ficial for if they were no assertions could be made concerning 
them 

xc 

an artificial system is one in which the smaller groups the 
genera are natural and in which the wider divisions classes 
orders are constructed by the peremptory application of selected 
characters selected however so as not to break up the smaller 
groups 

xci 

a natural system is one which attempts to make all the 
divisions natural the widest as well as the narrowest and there 
fore applies no characters peremptorily 

xcii 

natural groups are best described not by any definition which 
marks their boundaries but by a type which marks their centre 
the type of any natural group is an example which possesses in 
a marked degree all the leading characters of the class 



concerning ideas xxx 



xciii 

a natural group is steadily fixed though not precisely 
limited it is given in position though not circumscribed it is 
determined not by a boundary without but by a central point 
within not by what it strictly excludes but by what it emi 
nently includes by a type not by a definition 

xciv 

the prevalence of mathematics as an element of education 
has made us think definition the philosophical mode of fixing the 
meaning of a word if scientific natural history were intro 
duced into education men might become familiar with the fixa 
tion of the signification of words by types and this agrees more 
nearly with the common processes by which words acquire their 
significations 

xcv 

the attempts at natural classification are of three sorts 
according as they are made by the process of blind trial of general 
comparison or of subordination of characters the process of 
blind trial professes to make its classes by attention to all the 
characters but without proceeding methodically the process of 
general comparison professes to enumerate all the characters and 
forms its classes by the majority neither of these methods can 
really be carried into effect the method of subordination of 
characters considers some characters as more important than 
others and this method gives more consistent results than the 
others this method however does not depend upon the idea 
of likeness only but introduces the idea of organization or 
function 

xcvi 

a species is a collection of individuals which are descended 
from a common stock or which resemble such a collection as 
much as these resemble each other the resemblance being 
opposed to a definite difference 



xxxiv aphorisms 

xcvii 

a genus is a collection of species which resemble each other 
more than they resemble other species the resemblance being 
opposed to a definite difference 

xcviii 

the nomenclature of a classificatory science is the collection 
of the names of the species genera and other divisions the 
binary nomenclature which denotes a species by the generic and 
specific name is now commonly adopted in natural history 

xcix 

the diagnosis or scheme of the characters comes in the 
order of philosophy after the classification the characters do 
not make the classes they only enable us to recognize them the 
diagnosis is an artificial key to a natural system 

c 

the basis of all natural systems of classification is the idea 
of natural affinity the principle which this idea involves is 
this natural arrangements obtained from different sets of cha

in order to obtain a science of biology we must analyse the 
idea of life it has been proved by the biological speculations

forces involves a peculiar fundamental idea

gunpowder liberated from their chemical union exert great 
mechanical force a galvanic battery acting by chemical pro 
cess does the like vital forces include in their nature both 
chemical affinities and mechanical forces for vital powers 
produce both chemical changes as digestion and motions which 
imply considerable mechanical force as the motion of the sap 
and of the blood 

civ 

in voluntary motions sensations produce actions and the 
connexion is made by means of ideas in reflected motions the 
connexion neither seems to be nor is made by means of ideas in 
instinctive motions the connexion is such as requires ideas but 
we cannot believe the ideas to exist 

cv 

the assumption of a final cause in the structure of each part 
of animals and plants is as inevitable as the assumption of an 
efficient cause for every event the maxim that in organized 
bodies nothing is in vain is as necessarily true as the maxim that 
nothing happens by chance 

cvi 

the idea of living beings as subject to disease includes a 
recognition of a final cause in organization for disease is a 
state in which the vital forces do not attain their proper ends 

cvii 

the palsetiological sciences depend upon the idea of cause 
but the leading conception which they involve is that of historical 
cause not mechanical cause 

cviii 

each palsetiological science when complete must possess 
three members the phenomenology the etiology and the 
theory 



xxxvi aphorisms concerning ideas 

cix 

there are in the palsetiological sciences two antagonist doc 
trines catastrophes and uniformity the doctrine of a uniform 
course of nature is tenable only when we extend the notion of 
uniformity so far that it shall include catastrophes 

cx 

the catastrophist constructs theories the uniformitarian 
demolishes them the former adduces evidence of an origin the 
latter explains the evidence away the catastrophists dogmatism 
is undermined by the uniformitarian s skeptical hypotheses 
but when these hypotheses are asserted dogmatically they cease 
to be consistent with the doctrine of uniformity 

cxi 

in each of the palsetiological sciences we can ascend to 
remote periods by a chain of causes but in none can we ascend 
to a beginning of the chain 

cxii 

in contemplating the series of causes and effects which con 
stitutes the world we necessarily assume a first cause of the 
whole series 

cxiii 

the palaetiological sciences point backwards with lines which 
are broken but which all converge to the same invisible point 
and this point is the origin of the moral and spiritual as well as 
of the natural world

aphorisms concerning science 



i 

the two processes by which science is constructed are the 
explication of conceptions and the colligation of facts 

ii 

the explication of conceptions as requisite for the progress 
of science has been effected by means of discussions and contro 
versies among scientists often by debates concerning definitions 
these controversies have frequently led to the establishment of a 
definition but along with the definition a corresponding pro 
position has always been expressed or implied the essential 
requisite for the advance of science is the clearness of the concep 
tion not the establishment of a definition the construction of 
an exact definition is often very difficult the requisite condi 
tions of clear conceptions may often be expressed by axioms as 
well as by definitions 

iii 

conceptions for purposes of science must be appropriate as 
well as clear that is they must be modifications of that funda 
mental idea by which the phenomena can really be interpreted 
this maxim may warn us from error though it may not lead to 
discovery discovery depends upon the previous cultivation or 
natural clearness of the appropriate idea and therefore no dis 
covery is the work of accident 

iv 

facts are the materials of science but all facts involve ideas 
since in observing facts we cannot exclude ideas we must for 
the purposes of science take care that the ideas are clear and 
rigorously applied 



xxxvlli aphorisms 



v 

the last aphorism leads to such rules as the following 
that facts for the purposes of material science must involve 
conceptions of the intellect only and not emotions that facts 
must be observed with reference to our most exact conceptions 
number place figure motion that they must also be ob 
served with reference to any other exact conceptions which the 
phenomena suggest as force in mechanical phenomena concord 
in musical 

vi 

the resolution of complex facts into precise and measured 
partial facts we call the decomposition of facts this process 
is requisite for the progress of science but does not necessarily 
lead to progress 

vii 

science begins with common observation of facts but even at 
this stage requires that the observations be precise hence the 
sciences which depend upon space and number were the earliest 
formed after common observation come scientific observation 
and experiment 

viii 

the conceptions by which facts are bound together are sug 
gested by the sagacity of discoverers this sagacity cannot be 
taught it commonly succeeds by guessing and this success 
seems to consist in framing several tentative hypotheses and select 
ing the right one but a supply of appropriate hypotheses cannot 
be constructed by rule nor without inventive talent 

ix 

the truth of tentative hypotheses must be tested by their 
application to facts the discoverer must be ready carefully to 
try his hypotheses in this manner and to reject them if they will 
not bear the test in spite of indolence and vanity 



concerning science xxxix 

x 

the process of scientific discovery is cautious and rigorous not 
by abstaining from hypotheses but by rigorously comparing 
hypotheses with facts and by resolutely rejecting all which the 
comparison does not confirm 

xl 

hypotheses may be useful though involving much that is 
superfluous and even erroneous for they may supply the true 
bond of connexion of the facts and the superfluity and error may 
afterwards be pared away 

xii 

it is a test of true theories not only to account for but to 
predict phenomena 

xiii 



induction is a term applied to describe the process of a true 
colligation of facts by means of an exact and appropriate con 
ception an induction is also employed to denote the proposition 
which results from this process 

xiv 

the consilience of inductions takes place when an induction 
obtained from one class of facts coincides with an induction 
obtained from another different class this consilience is a test 
of the truth of the theory in which it occurs 

xv 

an induction is not the mere sum of the facts which are 
colligated the facts are not only brought together but seen in 
a new point of view a new mental element is superinduced 
and a peculiar constitution and discipline of mind are requisite in 
order to make this induction 

xvi 

although in every induction a new conception is superin 
duced upon thfr facts yet this once effectually done the novelty 



xl aphorisms 

of the conception is overlooked and the conception is considered 
as a part of the fact 

xvii 

the logic of induction consists in stating the facts and the 
inference in such a manner that the evidence of the inference is 
manifest just as the logic of deduction consists in stating the 
premises and the conclusion in such a manner that the evidence 
of the conclusion is manifest 

xviii 

the logic of deduction is exhibited by means of a certain 
formula namely a syllogism and every train of deductive 
reasoning to be demonstrative must be capable of resolution into 
a series of such formulae legitimately constructed in like man 
ner the logic of induction may be exhibited by means of certain 
formulas and every train of inductive inference to be sound 
must be capable of resolution into a scheme of such formulae 
legitimately constructed 

xix 

the inductive act of thought by which several facts are col 
ligated into one proposition may be expressed by saying the 
several facts are exactly expressed as onetfact if and only if we 
adopt the conceptions and the assertion of the proposition 

xx 

the one fact thus inductively obtained from several facts 
may be combined with other facts and colligated with them 
by a new act of induction this process may be indefinitely 
repeated and these successive processes are the steps of induc 
tion or of generalization from the lowest to the highest 

xxl 

the relation of the successive steps of induction may be 
exhibited by means of an inductive table in which the several 
facts are indicated and tied together by a bracket and the in 
ductive inference placed on the other side of the bracket and 



concerning science xli 

this arrangement repeated so as to form a genealogical table of 
each induction from the lowest to the highest 

xxii 

the logic of induction is the criterion of truth inferred 
from facts as the logic of deduction is the criterion of truth 
deduced from necessary principles the inductive table enables 
us to apply such a criterion for we can determine whether each 
induction is verified and justified by the facts which its bracket 
includes and if each induction in particular be sound the 
highest which merely combines them all must necessarily be 

sound also 

xxiii 

the distinction of fact and theory is only relative events 
and phenomena considered as particulars which may be colligated 
by induction are facts considered as generalities already ob 
tained by colligation of other facts they are theories the 
same event or phenomenon is a fact or a theory according as it 
is considered as standing on one side or the other of the inductive 

bracket 

xxiv 

inductive truths are of two kinds laws of phenomena and 
theories of causes it is necessary to begin in every science 
with the laws of phenomena but it is impossible that we 
should be satisfied to stop short of a theory of causes in phy 
sical astronomy physical optics geology and other sciences 
we have instances showing that we can make a great advance in 
inquiries after true theories of causes 

xxv 

art and science differ the object of science is knowledge 
the objects of art are works in art truth is a means to an 
end in science it is the only end hence the practical arts are 
not to be classed among the sciences 

xxvi 

practical knowledge such as art implies is not knowledge 
such as science includes brute animals have a practical know

xl aphorisms 

ledge of relations of space and force but they have no know 
ledge of geometry or mechanics 

xxvii 

the methods by which the construction of science is pro 
moted are methods of observation methods of obtaining clear 
ideas and methods of induction 

xxviii 

the methods of observation of quantity in general are 
numeration which is precise by the nature of number the 
measurement of space and of time which are easily made pre 
cise the conversion of space and time by which each aids the 
measurement of the other the method of repetition the 
method of coincidences or interferences the measurement of 
weight is made precise by the method of doubleweighing 
secondary qualities are measured by means of scales of degrees 
but in order to apply these scales the student requires the edu 
cation of the senses the education of the senses is forwarded 
by the practical study of descriptive natural history chemical 
manipulation and astronomical observation 

xxix 

the methods by which the acquisition of clear scientific 
ideas is promoted are mainly two intellectual education and 
discussion of ideas 

xxx 

the idea of space becomes more clear by studying geometry 
the idea of force by studying mechanics the ideas of likeness 
of kind of subordination of classes by studying natural history 

xxxi 

elementary mechanics should now form a part of intellectual 
education in order that the student may understand the theory 
of universal gravitation for an intellectual education should 
cultivate such ideas as enable the student to understand the 
most complete and admirable portions of the knowledge which 
the human race has attained to 



concerning science 

xxxii 

natural history ought to form a part of intellectual educa 
tion in order to correct certain prejudices which arise from cul 
tivating the intellect by means of mathematics alone and in 
order to lead the student to see that the division of things into 
kinds and the attribution and use of names are processes sus 
ceptible of great precision 

xxxiii 

the conceptions involved in scientific truths have attained 
the requisite degree of clearness by means of the discussions 
respecting ideas which have taken place among discoverers 
and their followers such discussions are very far from being 
unprofitable to science they are metaphysical and must be so 
the difference between discoverers and barren reasoners is that 
the former employ good and the latter bad metaphysics 

xxxiv 

the process of induction may be resolved into three steps 
the selection of the idea the construction of the conception and 
the determination of the magnitudes 

xxxv 

these three steps correspond to the determination of the in 
dependent variable the formula and the coefficients in mathema 
tical investigations or to the argument the law and the 
numerical data in a table of an inequality 

xxxvi 

the selection of the idea depends mainly upon inventive 
sagacity which operates by suggesting and trying various hypo 
theses some inquirers try erroneous hypotheses and thus 
exhausting the forms of error form the prelude to discovery 

xxxvii 

the following rules may be given in order to the selection 
of the idea for purposes of induction the idea and the facts 
must be homogeneous and the rule must be tested by the facts 

d 



xlv aphorisms 

xxxviii 

the construction of the conception very often includes in a 
great measure the determination of the magnitudes 

xxxix 

when a series of progressive numbers is given as the rasult 
of observation it may generally be reduced to law by combina 
tions of arithmetical and geometrical progressions 

xl 

a true formula for a progressive series of numbers cannot 
commonly be obtained from a narrow range of observations 

xli 

recurrent series of numbers must in most cases be expressed 
by circular formulae 

xlii 

the true construction of the conception is frequently sug 
gested by some hypothesis and in these cases the hypothesis 
may be useful though containing superfluous parts 

xliii 

there are special methods of induction applicable to quan 
tity of which the principal are the method of curves the 
method of means the method of least squares and the method 
of residues 

xliv 

the method of curves consists in drawing a curve of which 
the observed quantities are the ordinates the quantity on which 
the change of these quantities depends being the abscissa its 
efficacy depends upon the faculty which the eye possesses of 
readily detecting regularity and irregularity in forms it may be 
used to detect the laws which the observed quantities follow 
and also when the observations are inexact it may be used to 
correct these observations so as to obtain data more true than the 
observed facts themselves 



concerning science xlv 

xlv 

the method of means gets rid of irregularities by taking the 
arithmetical mean of a great number of observed quantities its 
efficacy depends upon this that in cases in which observed quan 
tities are affected by other inequalities besides that of which we 
wish to determine the law the excesses above and defects below 
the quantities which the law in question would produce will in 
a collection of many observations balance each other 

xlvi 

the method of least squares is a method of means in which 
the mean is taken according to the condition that the sum of the 
squares of the errors of observation shall be the least possible 
which the law of the facts allows it appears by the doctrine of 
chances that this is the most probable mean 

xlvii 

the method of residues consists in subtracting from the quan 
tities given by observation the quantity given by any law already 
discovered and then examining the remainder or residue in 
order to discover the leading law which it follows when this 
second law has been discovered the quantity given by it may be 
subtracted from the first residue thus giving a second residue 
which may be examined in the same manner and so on the 
efficacy of this method depends principally upon the circumstance 
of the laws of variation being successively smaller and smaller in 
amount or at least in their mean effect so that the ulterior 
undiscovered laws do not prevent the law in question from being 
prominent in the observations 

xlviii 

the method of means and the method of least squares can 
not be applied without our knowing the arguments of the inequa 
lities which we seek the method of curves and the method of 
residues when the arguments of the principal inequalities are 
known often make it easy to find the others 



xly aphorisms 



xlix 

the law of continuity is this that a quantity cannot pass 
from one amount to another by any change of conditions without 
passing through all intermediate magnitudes according to the 
intermediate conditions it may often be employed to disprove

the method of gradation consists in taking a number of stages 
of a property in question intermediate between two extreme 
cases which appear to be different it is employed to determine 
whether the extreme cases are really distinct or not 

li 

the method of gradation applied to decide the question 
whether the existing geological phenomena arise from existing 
causes leads to this result that the phenomena do appear to 
arise from existing causes but that the action of existing causes 
may in past times have transgressed to any extent their 
recorded limits of intensity 

lil 

the method of natural classification consists in classing 
cases not according to any assumed definition but according to 
the connexion of the facts themselves so as to make them the

aphorisms 
concerning the language of science 



introduction 

it has been shown in the history of science and will 
further appear in the course of the present work that almost 
every step in the progress of science is marked by the formation 
or appropriation of a technical term common language has 
in most cases a certain degree of looseness and ambiguity as 
common knowledge has usually something of vagueness and 
indistinctness in common cases too knowledge usually does 
not occupy the intellect alone but more or less interests some 
affection or puts in action the fancy and common language 
accommodating itself to the office of expressing such knowledge 
contains in every sentence a tinge of emotion or of imagina 
tion but when our knowledge becomes perfectly exact and 
purely intellectual we require a language which shall also be 
exact and intellectual which shall exclude alike vagueness and 
fancy imperfection and superfluity in which each term shall 
convey a meaning steadily fixed and rigorously limited such a 
language that of science becomes through the use of technical 
terms and we must now endeavour to lay down some maxims 
and suggestions by attention to which technical terms may be 
better fitted to answer their purpose in order to do this we 
shall in the first place take a rapid survey of the manner in 
which technical terms have been employed from the earliest 
periods of scientific history 

the progress of the use of technical scientific language offers 
to our notice two different and successive periods in the first of 
which technical terms were formed casually as convenience in 



the language of science xijx 

each case prompted while in the second period technical lan 
guage was constructed intentionally with set purpose with a 
regard to its connexion and with a view of constructing a system 
though the casual and systematic formation of technical terms 
cannot be separated by any precise date of time for at all periods 
some terms in some sciences have been framed unsystematically 
we may as a general description call the former the ancient and 
the latter the modern period in illustrating the two following 
aphorisms i will give examples of the course followed in each 
of these periods 

aphorism i 

in the ancient period of science technical terms were formed in 
three different ways by appropriating common words and 
fixing their meaning by constructing terms containing a 
description by constructing terms containing reference to a 
theory 

the earliest sciences offer the earliest examples of technical 
terms these are geometry arithmetic and astronomy to 
which we have soon after to add harmonics mechanics and 
optics in these sciences we may notice the abovementioned 
three different modes in which technical terms were formed 

i the simplest and first mode of acquiring technical terms 
is to take words current in common usage and by rigorously 
defining or otherwise fixing their meaning to fit them for the 
expression of scientific truths in this manner almost all 
the fundamental technical terms of geometry were formed 
a sphere a cone a cylinder had among the greeks at first 
meanings less precise than those which geometers gave to 
these words and besides the mere designation of form implied 
some use or application a sphere crfalpa was a handball 
used in games a cone kwvos was a boys spinningtop or the 
crest of a helmet a cylinder fcvwspos was a roller a cube 
tcvftos was a die till these words were adopted by the geo 
meters and made to signify among them pure modifications of 



t aphorisms concerning 

space so an angle ywvia was only a corner 
was a signal a line ypapprj was a mark a straight line 
evoela was marked by an adjective which at first meant only 
direct a plane evtresoy is the neuter form of an adjective 
which by its derivation means on the ground and hence flat in 
all these cases the word adopted as a term of science has its 
sense rigorously fixed and where the common use of the term is 
in any degree vague its meaning may be modified at the same 
time that it is thus limited thus a rhombus pofios by its 
derivation might mean any figure which is ticisted out of a regular 
form but it is confined by geometers to that figure which has 
four equal sides its angles being oblique in like manner a tra 
pezium rpatretyov originally signifies a table and thus might 
denote any form but as the tables of the greeks had one side 
shorter than the opposite one such a figure was at first called a 
trapezium afterwards the term was made to signify any figure 
with four unequal sides a name being more needful in geometry 
for this kind of figure than for the original form 

this class of technical terms namely words adopted from 
common language but rendered precise and determinate for pur 
poses of science may also be exemplified in other sciences thus 
as was observed in the early portion of the history of astronomy 
a day a month a year described at first portions of time marked 
by familiar changes but afterwards portions determined by rigor 
ous mathematical definitions the conception of the heavens as 
a revolving sphere is so obvious that we may consider the terms 
which involve this conception as parts of common language as 
the pole ttoos of the arctic circle which includes the stars that 
never set the horizon plcov a boundary applied technically 
to the circle bounding the visible earth and sky the turnings 
of the sun rpotral rjexloio which are mentioned by hesiod gave 
occasion to the term tropics the circles at which the sun in his 
annual motion turns back from his northward or southward advance 
the zones of the earth the torrid temperate and frigid the 
gnomon of a dial the limb or border of the moon or of a circular

instrument are terms of the same class an eclipse xfif is 
originally a deficiency or disappearance and joined with the name 
of the luminary an eclipse of the sun or of the moon described 
the phenomenon but when the term became technical it suf 
ficed without addition to designate the phenomenon 

in mechanics the greeks gave a scientific precision to very 
few words we may mention weights ftapea the arms of a lever 
ea its fulcrum utroyuoxtw and the verb to balance 
looppoirelv other terms which they used as momentum 
potrrj said force swajus did not acquire a distinct and definite 
meaning till the time of galileo or later we may observe that 
all abstract terms though in their scientific application expressing 
mere conceptions were probably at first derived from some word 
describing external objects thus the latin word for force vis 
seems to be connected with a greek word is or fls which often 
has nearly the same meaning but originally as it would seem 
signified a sinew or muscle the obvious seat of animal strength 

in later times the limitation imposed upon a word by its 
appropriation to scientific purposes is often more marked than 
in the cases above described thus the variation is made to 
mean in astronomy the second inequality of the moons motion 
in magnetism the variation signifies the angular deviation of the 
compassneedle from the north in pure mathematics the varia 
tion of a quantity is the formula which expresses the result of any 
small change of the most general kind in like manner parallax 
trapaxxagis denotes a change in general but is used by astro 
nomers to signify the change produced by the spectators being 
removed from the centre of the earth his theoretical place to the 
surface alkali at first denoted the ashes of a particular plant 
but afterwards all bodies having a certain class of chemical pro 
perties and in like manner acid the class opposed to alkali 
was modified in signification by chemists so as to refer no longer 
to the taste 

words thus borrowed from common language and converted 
by scientific writers into technical terms have some advantages 
and some disadvantages they possess this great convenience 
that they are understood after a very short explanation and 



lll aphorisms concerning 

retained in the memory without effort on the other hand they 
lead to some inconvenience for since they have a meaning in 
common language a careless reader is prone to disregard the 
technical limitation of this meaning and to attempt to collect 
their import in scientific hooks in the same vague and conjectural 
manner in which he collects the purpose of words in common 
cases hence the language of science when thus resembling 
common language is liable to be employed with an absence of that 
scientific precision which alone gives it value popular writers 
and talkers when they speak of force momentum action and 
reaction and the like often afford examples of the inaccuracy 
thus arising from the scientific appropriation of common terms 

ii another class of technical terms which we find occurring 
as soon as speculative science assumes a distinct shape consists of 
those which are intentionally constructed by speculators and 
which contain some description or indication distinctive of the 
conception to which they are applied such are a parallelogram 
raparypaijfjov which denotes a plane figure bounded by 
two pairs of parallel lines a parallelepiped trapdkkrfkojrijteov 
which signifies a solid figure bounded by three pairs of parallel 
planes a triangle rplycovos and a quadrangle rerp dycovos 
were perhaps words invented independently of the mathemati 
cians but such words extended to other cases pentagon decagon 
heccwdecagon polygon are inventions of scientific men such 
also are tetrahedron hexahedron dodecahedron tesseracontaocto 
hedron polyhedron and the like these words being con 
structed by speculative writers explain themselves or at least 
require only some conventional limitation easily adopted thus 
parallelogram might mean a figure bounded by any number of 
sets of parallel lines but it is conventionally restricted to a figure 
of four sides so a great circle in a sphere means one which 
passes through the centre of the sphere and a small circle is any 
other so in trigonometry we have the hypotenuse jutrorei 
vovcra or subtending line to designate the line subtending an 
angle in this branch of mathematics we have many invented 
technical terms as complement supplement cosine cotangent a 
sphtrical angle the pole of a circle or of a sphere the word sine 



the language of science liii 

itself appears to belong to the class of terms already described as 
scientific appropriations of common terms although its origin is 
somewhat obscure 

mathematicians were naturally led to construct these and 
many other terms by the progress of their speculations in like 
manner when astronomy took the form of a speculative science 
words were invented to denote distinctly the conceptions thus in 
troduced thus the suns annual path among the stars in which 
not only solar but also all lunar eclipses occur was termed the 
ecliptic the circle which the sun describes in his diurnal motion 
when the days and nights are equal the greeks called the equi 
diurnal laypepivos the latin astronomers the equinoctial and 
the corresponding circle on the earth was the equator the 
ecliptic intersected the equinoctial in the equinoctial points the 
solstices in greek rpotral were the times when the sun 
arrested his motion northwards or southwards and the solstitial 
points ra rpotriica otjaeia were the places in the ecliptic 
where he then was the name of meridians was given to circles 
passing through the poles of the equator the solstitial colure 
tcoovpos curtailed was one of these circles which passes 
through the solstitial points and is intercepted by the horizon 

we have borrowed from the arabians various astronomical 
terms as zenith nadir azimuth almacantar and these words 
which among the arabians probably belonged to the first class 
of appropriated scientific terms are for us examples of the second 
class invented scientific terms although they differ from most 
that we have mentioned in not containing an etymology corre 
sponding to their meaning in any language with which european 
cultivators of science are generally familiar indeed the distinc 
tion of our two classes though convenient is in a great measure 
casual thus most of the words we formerly mentioned asparal 
lax horizon eclipse though appropriated technical terms among 
the greeks are to us invented technical terms 

in the construction of such terms as we are now considering 
those languages have a great advantage which possess a power of 
forming words by composition this was eminently the case 
with the greek language and hence most of the ancient terrm 



lv aphorisms concerning 

of science in that language when their origin is once explained 
are clearly understood and easily retained of modern european 
languages the german possesses the greatest facility of com 
position and hence scientific authors in that language are 
able to invent terms which it is impossible to imitate in the 
other languages of europe thus weiss distinguishes his vari 
ous systems of crystals as zweiundzweigliedrig einundzwei 
gliedrig dreyunddreygliedrig c twoandtwomembered 
oneandtwomembered threeandthreemembered and hes 
sel also a writer on crystallography speaks of doublyonemem 
bered edges fourandthree spaced rays and the like 

how far the composition of words in such cases may be 
practised in the english language and the general question what 
are the best rules and artifices in such cases i shall afterwards 
consider in the mean time i may observe that this list of in 
vented technical terms might easily be much enlarged thus in 
harmonics we have the various intervals as a fourth a fifth an 
octave diatessaron diapente diapason a comma which is the 
difference of a major and minor tone we have the various 
moods or keys and the notes of various lengths as minims 
breves semibreves quavers in chemistry gas was at first a 
technical term invented by van helmont though it has now 
been almost adopted into common language i omit many 
words which will perhaps suggest themselves to the reader 
because they belong rather to the next class which i now proceed 
to notice 

iii the third class of technical terms consists of such as are 
constructed by men of science and involve some theoretical idea 
in the meaning which their derivation implies they do not 
merely describe like the class last spoken of but describe with 
reference to some doctrine or hypothesis which is accepted as a 
portion of science thus latitude and longitude according to 
their origin signify breadth and length they are used however 
to denote measures of the distance of a place on the earths sur 
face from the equator and from the first meridian of w t hich dis 
tances one cannot be called length more properly than the other 
but this appropriation of these words may be explained by recol

lecting that the earth as known to the ancient geographers was 
much further extended from east to west than from north to south 
the precession of the equinoxes is a term which implies that the 
stars are fixed while the point which is the origin of the measure 
of celestial longitude moves backward the eight ascension of a 
star is a measure of its position corresponding to terrestrial longi 
tude this quantity is identical with the angular ascent of the 
equinoctial point when the star is in the horizon in a right sphere 
that is a sphere which supposes the spectator to be at the equa 
tor the oblique ascension a term now little used is derived 
in like manner from an oblique sphere the motion of a planet 
is direct or retrograde in consequentia signa or in antecedentia 
in reference to a certain assumed standard direction for celestial 
motions namely the direction opposite to that of the suns daily 
motion and agreeing with his annual motion among the stars or 
with what is much more evident the moons monthly motion 
the equation of time is the quantity which must be added to or 
subtracted from the time marked by the sun in order to reduce 
it to a theoretical condition of equable progress in like manner 
the equation of the centre of the sun or of the moon is the angle 
which must be added to or subtracted from the actual advance of 
the luminary in the heavens in order to make its motion equable 
besides the equation of the centre of the moon which represents 
the first and greatest of her deviations from equable motion there 
are many other equations by the application of which her motion 
is brought nearer and nearer to perfect uniformity the second 
of these equations is called the ejection the third the variation 
the fourth the annual equation the motion of the sun as affected 
by its inequalities is called his anomaly which term denotes ine 
quality in the history of astronomy we find that the ine 
quable motions of the sun moon and planets were in a great 
measure reduced to rule and system by the greeks by the aid of 
an hypothesis of circles revolving and carrying in their motion 
other circles which also revolved this hypothesis introduced 
many technical terms as deferent epicycle eccentric in like 
manner the theories which have more recently taken the place of 
the theory of epicycles have introduced other technical terms as 



lv aphorisms concerning 

the elliptical orbit the radius vector and the equable description 
of areas by this radius which phrases express the true laws of the 
planetary motions 

there is no subject on which theoretical views have been so 
long and so extensively prevalent as astronomy and therefore no 
other science in which there are so many technical terms of 
the kind we are now considering in other subjects so far as 
theories have been established they have been accompanied by 
the introduction or fixation of technical terms thus as we have 
seen in the examination of the foundations of mechanics the 
terms force and inertia derive their precise meaning from a recog 
nition of the first law of motion accelerating force and compo 
sition of motion involve the second law moving force momentum 
action and reaction are expressions which imply the third law 
the term vis viva was introduced to express a general property of 
moving bodies and other terms have been introduced for like pur 
poses as impetus by smeaton and work done by other engineers 
the proposition which was termed the hydrostatic paradox had 
this name in reference to its violating a supposed law of the action 
of forces the verb to gravitate and the abstract term gravitation 
sealed the establishment of newtons theory of the solar system 

in some of the sciences opinions either false or disguised in 
very fantastical imagery have prevailed and the terms which 
have been introduced during the reign of such opinions bear the 
impress of the time thus in the days of alchemy the sub 
stances with which the operator dealt were personified and a 
metal when exhibited pure and free from all admixture was con 
sidered as a little king and was hence called a regulus a term 
not yet quite obsolete in like manner a substance from which 
nothing more of any value could be extracted was dead and was 
called a caput mortuum quick silver that is live silver argen 
tum vivum was killed by certain admixtures and was revived 
when restored to its pure state 

we find a great number of medical terms which bear the 
mark of opinions formerly prevalent among physicians and 
though these opinions hardly form a part of the progress of 
science and were not presented in our history we may notice

some of these terms as examples of the mode in which words 
involve in their derivation obsolete opinions such words as 
hysterics hypochondriac melancholy cholera colic quinsey squinan 
tia ovvdyrj a suffocation megrim migraine hemicranium the 
middle of the skull rickets rachitis from aw the backbone

apopa the joints are names derived from the supposed or real 
seat and circumstances of the diseases the word from which 
the first of the above names is derived vcnepa the last place 
signifies the womb according to its order in a certain systematic 
enumeration of parts the second word hypochondriac means 
something affecting the viscera below the cartilage of the breast 
bone which cartilage is called ovspos melancholy and cholera 
derive their names from supposed affections of ox the bile 
colic is that which affects the colon cwxov the largest member 
of the bowels a disorder of the eye is called gutta serena the 
 drop serene of milton in contradistinction to gutta turbida 
in which the impediment to vision is perceptibly opake other 
terms also record the opinions of the ancient anatomists as duode 
num a certain portion of the intestines which they estimated as 
twelve inches long we might add other allusions as the tendon 
of achilles 

astrology also supplied a number of words founded upon 
fanciful opinions but this study having been expelled from the 
list of sciences such words now survive only so far as they have 
found a place in common language thus men were termed mer 
curial martial jovial or saturnine accordingly as their characters 
were supposed to be determined by the influence of the planets 
mercury mars jupiter or saturn other expressions such as 
disastrous illstarred exorbitant lord of the ascendant and hence 

vol i e 



aphorisms concerning 

mcenclancy influence a sphere of aitloji and the like may serve 
to show how extensively astrological opinions have affected lan 
guage though the doctrine is no longer a recognized science 

the preceding examples will make it manifest that opinions 
even of a recondite and complex kind are often implied in the 
derivation of words and thus will show how scientific terms 
framed by the cultivators of science may involve received hypo 
theses and theories when terms are thus constructed they 
serve not only to convey with ease but to preserve steadily and 
to diffuse widely the opinions which they thus assume more 
over they enable the speculator to employ these complex con 
ceptions the creations of science and the results of much labour 
and thought as readily and familiarly as if they were convictions 
borrowed at once from the senses they are thus powerful 
instruments in enabling philosophers to ascend from one step of 
induction and generalization to another and hereby contribute 
powerfully to the advance of knowledge and truth 

it should be noticed before we proceed that the names of 
natural objects when they come to be considered as the objects of 
a science are selected according to the processes already enume 
rated for the most part the natural historian adopts the com 
mon names of animals plants minerals gems and the like and 
only endeavours to secure their steady and consistent application 
but many of these names imply some peculiar often fanciful 
belief respecting the object 

various plants derive their names from their supposed virtues 
as herniaria rupturewort or from legends as herba sancti jo 
kannis st johns wort the same is the case with minerals 
thus the topaz was asserted to come from an island so shrouded 
in mists that navigators could only conjecture rotrdw where it 
was in these latter cases however the legend appears not to 
be the true origin of the name but to be suggested by it 

the privilege of constructing names where they are w r anted 
belongs to natural historians no less than to the cultivators of 
physical science yet in the ancient world writers of the former 
class appear rarely to have exercised this privilege even when 
they felt the imperfections of the current language thus aris

totle repeatedly mentions classes of animals which have no name 
as coordinate with classes that have names but he hardly ven 
tures to propose names which may supply these defects the 
vast importance of nomenclature in natural history was not recog 
nized till the modern period 

we have however hitherto considered only the formation or 
appropriation of single terms in science except so far as several 
terms may in some instances be connected by reference to a com 
mon theory but when the value of technical terms began to be 
fully appreciated philosophers proceeded to introduce them into 
their sciences more copiously and in a more systematic manner 
in this way the modern history of technical language has some 
features of a different aspect from the ancient and must give rise 
to a separate aphorism 

aphorism ii 

in the modern period of science besides the three processes 
anciently employed in the formation of technical terms there 
have been introduced systematic nomenclature systematic 
terminology and the systematic modification of terms to 
express theoretical relations 

writers upon science have gone on up to modern times 
forming such technical terms as they had occasion for by the 
three processes above described namely appropriating and 
limiting words in common use constructing for themselves 
words descriptive of the conception which they wished to con 
ve y or framing terms which by their signification imply the

classes of animals are quadrupeds birds fishes whales cetaceans oysters 
 testaceans animals like crabs which have no general name crustaceans

by a name malacostraca softshelled which has since been adopted by 
naturalists

adoption of a theory thus among the terms introduced by 
the study of the connexion between magnetism and electricity 
the word pole is an example of the first kind the name of the 
subject electromagnetism of the second and the term current 
involving an hypothesis of the motion of a fluid is an instance 
of the third class in chemistry the term salt was adopted 
from common language and its meaning extended to denote 
any compound of a certain kind the term neutral salt implied 
the notion of a balanced opposition in the two elements of the 
compound and such words as subacid and superacid invented 
on purpose were introduced to indicate the cases in which this 
balance was not attained again when the phlogistic theory of 
chemistry was established the term phlogiston was introduced to 
express the theory and from this such terms as phlogisticated and 
dephlogisticated were derived exclusively words of science but 
in such instances as have just been given we approach towards a 
systematic modification of terms which is a peculiar process of 
modern times of this modern chemistry forms a prominent 
example which we shall soon consider but we shall first notice 
the other processes mentioned in the aphorism 

i in ancient times no attempt was made to invent or select 
a nomenclature of the objects of natural history which should 
be precise and permanent the omission of this step by the 
ancient naturalists gave rise to enormous difficulty and loss of 
time when the sciences resumed their activity we have seen 
in the history of the sciences of classification and of botany in 
especial that the early cultivators of that study in modern times 
endeavoured to identify all the plants described by greek and 
roman writers with those which grow in the north of europe 
and were involved in endless confusion j by the multiplication 
of names of plants at the same time superfluous and ambiguous 
the synonymies which botanists bauhin and others found it 
necessary to publish were the evidences of these inconveniences 
in consequence of the defectiveness of the ancient botanical 
nomenclature we are even yet uncertain with respect to the iden

tification of some of the most common trees mentioned by classical 
writers the ignorance of botanists respecting the importance of 
nomenclature operated in another manner to impede the progress 
of science as a good nomenclature presupposes a good system 
of classification so on the other hand a system of classification 
cannot become permanent without a corresponding nomenclature 
csesalpinus in the sixteenth century published an excellent sys 
tem of arrangement for plants but this not being connected with 
any system of names was never extensively accepted and soon 
fell into oblivion the business of framing a scientific botanical 
classification was in this way delayed for about a century in 
the same manner willoughbys classification of fishes though as 
cuvier says far better than any which preceded it was never 
extensively adopted in consequence of having no nomenclature 
connected with it 

ii probably one main cause which so long retarded the work 
of fixing at the same time the arrangement and the names of 
plants was the great number of minute and diversified particulars 
in the structure of each plant which such a process implied the 
stalks leaves flowers and fruits of vegetables with their appen 
dages may vary in so many ways that common language is quite 
insufficient to express clearly and precisely their resemblances 
and differences hence botany required not only a fixed system 
of names of plants but also an artificial system of phrases fitted 
to describe their parts not only a nomenclature but also a 
terminology the terminology was in fact an instrument indis 
pensably requisite in giving fixity to the nomenclature the 
recognition of the kinds of plants must depend upon the exact 
comparison of their resemblances and differences and to become 
a part of permanent science this comparison must be recorded in 
words 

the formation of an exact descriptive language for botany 
was thus the first step in that systematic construction of the 
technical language of science which is one of the main features 

 for instance whether the fagus of the latins be the beech or the 
chesnut

aphorisms concerning 

in the intellectual history of modern times the ancient botan 
ists as decandolle says did not make any attempt to select 
terms of which the sense was rigorously determined and each 
of them employed in his descriptions the words metaphors or 
periphrases which his own genius suggested in the history of 
botany f i have noticed some of the persons who contributed 
to this improvement chasms it is there stated first taught 
botanists to describe well he introduced exactitude precision 
neatness elegance method he says nothing superfluous he 
omits nothing necessary this task was further carried on by 
jung and rayj in these authors we see the importance which 
began to be attached to the exact definition of descriptive terms 
for example ray quotes jungs definition of caulis a stalk 

the improvement of descriptive language and the formation 
of schemes of classification of plants went on gradually for some 
time and was much advanced by tournefort but at last 
linnaeus embodied and followed out the convictions which had 
gradually been accumulating in the breasts of botanists and by 
remodelling throughout both the terminology and the nomencla 
ture of botany produced one of the greatest reforms which ever 
took place in any science he thus supplied a conspicuous 
example of such a reform and a most admirable model of a lan 
guage from which other sciences may gather great instruction 
i shall not here give any account of the terms and words intro 
duced by linnaeus they have been exemplified in the history 
of science and the principles which they involve i shall con 
sider separately hereafter i will only remind the reader that 
the great simplification in nomenclature which was the result of 
his labours consisted in designating each kind of plant by a binary 
term consisting of the name of the genus combined with that of 
the species an artifice seemingly obvious but more convenient 
in its results tfran could possibly have been anticipated 

since linnaeus the progress of botanical anatomy and of

descriptive botany have led to the rejection of several inexact 
expressions and to the adoption of several new terms especially 
in describing the structure of the fruit and the parts of cryptoga 
mous plants hedwig medikus necker desvaux mirbel and 
especially gsertner link and richard have proposed several 
useful innovations in these as in other parts of the subject but 
the general mass of the words now current consists still and will 
probably continue to consist of the terms established by the 
swedish botanist 

when it was seen that botany derived so great advantages 
from a systematic improvement of its language it was natural 
that other sciences and especially classificatory sciences should 
endeavour to follow its example this attempt was made in 
mineralogy by werner and afterwards further pursued by mohs 
werners innovations in the descriptive language of mineralogy 
were the result of great acuteness an intimate acquaintance 
with minerals and a most methodical spirit and were in 
most respects great improvements upon previous practices yet 
the introduction of them into mineralogy was far from rege 
nerating that science as botany had been regenerated by the 
linnsean reform it would seem that the perpetual scrupulous 
attention to most minute differences as of lustre colour frac 
ture the greater part of which are not really important fetters 
the mind rather than disciplines or arms it for generalization 
cuvier has remarked f that werner after his first essay on the 
characters of minerals wrote little as if he had been afraid of 
using the system which he had created and desirous of escaping 
from the chains which he had imposed upon others and he 
justly adds that werner dwelt least in his descriptions upon that 
which is really the most important feature of all the crystalline 
structure this which is truly a definite character like those 
of botany does when it can be clearly discerned determine the 
place of the mineral in a system this therefore is the character 
which of all others ought to be most carefully expressed by an 
appropriate language this task hardly begun by werner has 
since been fully executed by others especially by rome de fjsle 

 decandolle thelem p t elogcs ii 



lxv aphorisms concerning 

hauy and mohs all the forms of crystals can be described 
in the most precise manner by the aid of the labours of these 
writers and their successors but there is one circumstance 
well worthy our notice in these descriptions it is found that 
the language in which they can best be conveyed is not that of 
words but of symbols the relations of space which are involved 
in the forms of crystalline bodies though perfectly definite are so 
complex and numerous that they cannot be expressed except in 
the language of mathematics and thus we have an extensive 
and recondite branch of mathematical science which is in fact 
only a part of the terminology of the mineralogist 

the terminology of mineralogy being thus reformed an at 
tempt was made to improve its nomenclature also by following the 
example of botany professor mohs was the proposer of this 
innovation the names framed by him were however not com 
posed of two but of three elements designating respectively the 
species the genus and the order thus he has such species as 
rjiombohedral lime haloide octahedral fluor haloide prismatic 
hal baryte these names have not been generally adopted nor 
is it likely that any names constructed on such a scheme will find 
acceptance among mineralogists till the higher divisions of the 
system are found to have some definite character we see no 
real mineralogical significance in mohss genera and orders and 
hence we do not expect them to retain a permanent place in 
the science 

the only systematic names which have hitherto been generally 
admitted in mineralogy are those expressing the chemical consti 
tution of the substance and these belong to a system of technical 
terms different from any we have yet spoken of namely to terms 
formed by systematic modification 

iii the language of chemistry was already as we have seen 
tending to assume a systematic character even under the reign of 
the phlogiston theory but when the oxygen theory succeeded to 
the throne it very fortunately happened that its supporters had the 
courage and the foresight to undertake a completely new and sys 
tematic recoinage of the terms belonging to the science the new 
 hist ind sci iii 



the language of science lxv 

nomenclature vas constructed upon a principle hitherto hardly 
applied in science but eminently commodious and fertile namely 
the principle of indicating a modification of relations of elements 
by a change in the termination of the word thus the new che 
mical school spoke of sulphuric and sulphurous acids of sulphates 
and sulphites of bases and of sulphurets of metals and in like 
manner of phosphoric and phosphorous acids of phosphates phos 
phites phosphurets in this manner a nomenclature was produced 
in which the very name of a substance indicated at once its con 
stitution and place in the system 

the introduction of this chemical language can never cease to 
be considered one of the most important steps ever made in the 
improvement of technical terms and as a signal instance of the 
advantages which may result from artifices apparently trivial if 
employed in a manner conformable to the laws of phenomena and 
systematically pursued it was however proved that this lan 
guage with all its merits had some defects the relations of 
elements in composition were discovered to be more numerous 
than the modes of expression which the terminations supplied 
besides the sulphurous and sulphuric acids it appeared there were 
others these were called the hyposulphurous and hyposulphuric 
but these names though convenient no longer implied by their 
form any definite relation the compounds of nitrogen and 
oxygen are in order the protoxide the deutoxide or binoxide 
hyponitrous acid nitrous acid and nitric acid the nomen 
clature here ceases to be systematic we have three oxides of 
iron of which we may call the first the protoxide but we cannot 
call the others the deutoxide and tritoxide for by doing so we 
should convey a perfectly erroneous notion of the proportions of 
the elements they are called the protoxide the black oxide 
and the peroxide we are here thrown back upon terms quite 
unconnected with the system 

other defects in the nomenclature arose from errors in the 
theory as for example the names of the muriatic oxymuriatic 
and hyperoxymuriatic acids which after the establishment of the 
new theory of chlorine were changed to hydrochloric acid chlo 
rine and chloric acid 



lxvi aphorisms concerning 

thus the chemical system of nomenclature founded upon the 
oxygen theory while it shows how much may he effected by a 
good and consistent scheme of terms framed according to the real 
relations of objects proves also that such a scheme can hardly be 
permanent in its original form bnt will almost inevitably become 
imperfect and anomalous in consequence of the accumulation of 
new facts and the introduction of new generalizations still 
we may venture to say that such a scheme does not on this 
account become worthless for it not only answers its purpose 
in the stage of scientific progress to which it belongs so far 
as it is not erroneous or merely conventional but really sys 
tematic and significant of truth its terms can be translated at 
once into the language of any higher generalization which is after 
wards arrived at if terms express relations really ascertained to 
be true they can never lose their value by any change of the 
received theory they are like coins of pure metal which even 
when carried into a country which does not recognize the sove 
reign whose impress they bear are still gladly received and may 
by the addition of an explanatory mark continue part of the 
common currency of the country 

these two great instances of the reform of scientific language 
in botany and in chemistry are much the most important and 
instructive events of this kind which the history of science offers 
it is not necessary to pursue our historical survey further our 
remaining aphorisms respecting the language of science will be 
collected and illustrated indiscriminately from the precepts and 
the examples of preceding philosophers of all periods 

we may however remark that aphorisms iii iv v 
vi vii respect peculiarly the formation of technical terms 
by the appropriation of common words while the remaining 
ones apply to the formation of new terms 

it does not appear possible to lay down a system of rules 
which may determine and regulate the construction of all techni 
cal terms on all the occasions on which the progress of science 
makes them necessary or convenient but if we can collect a few 
maxims such as have already offered themselves to the minds of 
philosophers or such as may be justified by the instances by which 



the language of science lxv 

we shall illustrate them these maxims may avail to guide us in 
doubtful cases and to prevent our aiming at advantages which arc 
unattainable or being disturbed by seeming imperfections which 
are really no evils i shall therefore state such maxims of this 
kind as seem most sound and useful 

aphorism iii 

in framing scientific terms the appropriation of old words is 
preferable to the invention of new ones 

this maxim is stated by bacon in his usual striking man 
ner after mentioning metaphysic as one of the divisions of 
natural philosophy he adds wherein i desire it may be 
conceived that i use the word metaphysic in a differing sense 
from that that is received and in like manner i doubt not but 
it will easily appear to men of judgment that in this and other 
particulars wheresoever my conception and notion may differ 
from the ancient yet i am studious to keep the ancient terms 
for hoping well to deliver myself from mistaking by the order 
and perspicuous expressing of that i do propound i am otherwise 
zealous and affectionate to recede as little from antiquity either in 
terms or opinions as may stand with truth and the proficience of 
knowledge to me that do desire as much as lieth in my 
pen to ground a sociable intercourse between antiquity and pro 
ficience it seemeth best to keep a way with antiquity usque ad 
aras and therefore to retain the ancient terms though i some 
times alter the uses and definitions according to the moderate 
proceeding in civil governments when although there be some 
alteration yet that holdetk which tacitus wisely noteth eadem 
magistratuum vocdbula 

we have had before us a sufficient number of examples of 
scientific terms thus framed for they formed the first of three 
classes which we described in the first aphorism and we 
may again remark that science when she thus adopts terms 
which are in common use always limits and fixes their meaning 
in a technical manner we may also repeat here the warning 
 de augm y lib iii c 



lxv aphorisms concerning 

already given respecting terms of this kind that they are peculi 
arly liable to mislead readers who do not take care to understand 
them in their technical instead of their common signification 
force momentum inertia impetus vis viva are terms which are 
very useful if we rigorously bear in mind the import which belongs 
to each of them in the best treatises on mechanics but if the 
reader content himself with conjecturing their meaning from the 
context his knowledge will be confused and worthless 

in the application of this third aphorism other rules are 
to be attended to which i add 

aphorism iv 

when common words are appropriated as technical terms their 
meaning and relations in common use should be retained as far 
as can conveniently be done 

i will state an example in which this rule seems to be appli 
cable mr davies gilbert has recently proposed the term 
efficiency to designate the work which a machine according to 
the force exerted upon it is capable of doing the work being 
measured by the weight raised and the space through which it 
is raised jointly the usual term employed among engineers for 
the work which a machine actually does measured in the way 
just stated is duty but as there appears to be a little incon 
gruity in calling that work efficiency which the machine ought to 
do when we call that work duty which it really does i have 
proposed to term these two quantities theoretical efficiency and 
practical efficiency or theoretical duty and practical duty 

since common words are often vague in their meaning i 
add as a necessary accompaniment to the third aphorism the 
following 

 phil trans p 



the language of science lxlx 

aphorism y 

when common words are appropriated as technical terms their 
meaning may be modified and must be rigorously fixed 

this is stated by bacon in the above extract to retain the 
ancient terms though i sometimes alter the uses and definitions 
the scientific use of the term is in all cases much more precise 
than the common use the loose notions of velocity and force 
for instance which are sufficient for the usual purposes of lan 
guage require to be fixed by exact measures when these are made 
terms in the science of mechanics 

this scientific fixation of the meaning of words is to be looked 
upon as a matter of convention although it is in reality often an 
inevitable result of the progress of science momentum is con 
ventionally defined to be the product of the numbers expressing 
the weight and the velocity but then it could be of no use 
in expressing the laws of motion if it were defined otherwise 

hence it is no valid objection to a scientific term that the 
word in common language does not mean exactly the same as 
in its common use it is no sufficient reason against the use of 
the term acid for a class of bodies that all the substances belong 
ing to this class are not sour we have seen that a trapezium is 
used in geometry for any foursided figure though originally it 
meant a figure with two opposite sides parallel and the two others 
equal a certain stratum which lies below the chalk is termed 
by english geologists the green sand it has sometimes been 
objected to this denomination that the stratum has very fre 
quently no tinge of green and that it is often composed of lime 
with little or no sand yet the term is a good technical term 
in spite of these apparent improprieties so long as it is care 
fully applied to that stratum which is geologically equivalent to 
the greenish sandy bed to which the appellation was originally 
applied 

when it appeared that geometry would have to be employed 
as much at least about the heavens as the earth plato exclaimed 
against the folly of calling the science by such a name since the 
word signifies earthmeasuring yet the word geometry has 



lxx aphorisms concerning 

retained its place and answered its purpose perfectly welljip to 
the present day 

but though the meaning of the term may be modified or 
extended it must be rigorously fixed when it is appropriated to 
science this process is most abundantly exemplified by the 
terminology of natural history and especially of botany in 
which each term has a most precise meaning assigned to it 
thus linnaeus established exact distinctions between fasciculus 
capitulum racemus thyrsus paniculus spica amentum corymbus 
umbella cyma verticillus or in the language of english bo 
tanists a tuft a head a duster a bunch a panicle a spike a cat 
kin a corymb an umbel a cyme a whorl and it has since been 
laid down as a rule that each organ ought to have a separate and 
appropriate name so that the term leaf for instance shall never 
be applied to a leaflet a bractea or a sepal of the calyx 

botanists have not been content with fixing the meaning of 
their terms by verbal definition but have also illustrated them 
by figures which address the eye of these as excellent modern 
examples may be mentioned those which occur in the works of 
mirbelf and lmdleyj 

aphorism vi 

when common words are appropriated as technical terms this must 
be done so that they are not ambiguous in their application 

an example will explain this maxim the conditions of a 
body as a solid a liquid and an air have been distinguished as 
different forms of the body but the word form as applied to 
bodies has other meanings so that if we were to inquire in what 
form water exists in a snowcloud it might be doubted whether 
the forms of crystallization were meant or the different forms of 
ice water and vapour hence i have proposed to reject the 
term form in such cases and to speak of the different consistence 
of a body in these conditions the term consistence is usually 
applied to conditions between solid and fluid and may without 

 decandolle theor el t elemens de botanique 

j elements of botany hist ind sci iii 



the language of science lxxi 

effort be extended to those limiting conditions and though it 
may appear more harsh to extend the term consistence to the 
state of air it may be justified by what has been said in speaking 
of aphorism v 

i may notice another example of the necessity of avoiding 
ambiguous words a philosopher who makes method his study 
would naturally be termed a methodist but unluckily this word 
is already appropriated to a religious sect and hence we could 
hardly venture to speak of csesalpinus ray morison rivinus 
tournefort linnaeus and their successors as botanical methodists 
again by this maxim we are almost debarred from using the 
term physician for a cultivator of the science of physics because 
it already signifies a practiser of physic we might perhaps 
still use physician as the equivalent of the french physicien 
in virtue of aphorism v but probably it would be better to 
form a new word thus we may say that while the naturalist 
employs principally the ideas of resemblance and life the physicist 
proceeds upon the ideas of force matter and the properties of 
matter 

whatever may be thought of this proposal the maxim which 
it implies is frequently useful it is this 

aphorism vii 

it is better to form new words as technical terms than to employ 
old ones in which the last three aphorisms cannot be complied 
with 

the principal inconvenience attending the employment of 
new words constructed expressly for the use of science is the 
difficulty of effectually introducing them readers will not 
readily take the trouble to learn the meaning of a word in which 
the memory is not assisted by some obvious suggestion connected 
with the common use of language when this difficulty is 
overcome the new word is better than one merely appropriated 
since it is more secure from vagueness and confusion and in 
cases where the inconveniences belonging to a scientific use of 
common words become great and inevitable a new word must 
be framed and introduced 



lxx aphorisms concerning 

the maxims which belong to the construction of such words 
will be stated hereafter but i may notice an instance or two 
tending to show the necessity of the maxim now before us 

the word force has been appropriated in the science of 
mechanics in two senses as indicating the cause of motion and 
again as expressing certain measures of the effects of this cause 
in the phrases accelerating force and moving force hence we 
might have occasion to speak of the accelerating or moving force 
of a certain force for instance if we were to say that the centre 
of force which governs the motions of the planets resides in the 
sun and that the accelerating force of this force varies only with 
the distance but its moving force varies as the product of the 
mass of the sun and the planet this is a harsh and incongruous 
mode of expression and might have been avoided if instead of 
accelerating force and moving force single abstract terms had been 
introduced by newton if for instance he had said that the 
velocity generated in a second measures the acceleratimty of the 
force which produces it and the momentum produced in a second 
measures the motimty of the force 

the science which treats of heat has hitherto had no special 
designation treatises upon it have generally been termed treatises 
on heat but this practice of employing the same term to denote 
the property and the science which treats of it is awkward and 
often ambiguous and it is further attended with this incon 
venience that we have no adjective derived from the name of the 
science as we have in other cases when we speak of acoustical 
experiments and optical theories this inconvenience has led 
various persons to suggest names for the science of heat m 
le comte terms it thermology in the history of the sciences 
i have named it thermotics which appears to me to agree better 
with the analogy of the names of other corresponding sciences 
acoustics and optics 

electricity is in the same condition as heat having only one 
word to express the property and the science m le comte 
proposes electrology for the same reason as before i should 
conceive electrics more agreeable to analogy the coincidence 
of the word with the plural of electric would not give rise to 



the language of science lxx 

ambiguity for electrics taken as the name of a science would 
be singular like optics and mechanics but a term offers itself 
to express common or machine electrics which appears worthy 
of admission though involving a theoretical view the received 
doctrine of the difference between voltaic and common electricity 
is that in the former case the fluid must be considered as in 
motion in the latter as at rest the science which treats of the 
former class of subjects is commonly termed electrodynamics 
which obviously suggests the name electrostatics for the latter 

the subject of the tides is in like manner destitute of any 
name which designates the science concerned about it i have 
ventured to employ the term tidology having been much engaged 
in tidological researches 

many persons possess a peculiarity of vision which disables 
them from distinguishing certain colours on examining many 
such cases we find that in all such persons the peculiarities are 
the same all of them confounding scarlet with green and pink 
with blue hence they form a class which for the convenience 
of physiologists and others ought to have a fixed designation 
instead of calling them as has usually been done persons having 
a peculiarity of vision we might take a greek term implying 
this meaning and term them idiopts 

but my business at present is not to speak of the selection of 
new terms when they are introduced but to illustrate the maxim 
that the necessity for their introduction often arises the con 
struction of new terms will be treated of subsequently 



aphorism viii 

terms must be constructed and appropriated so as to be fitted to 
enunciate simply and clearly true general propositions 

this aphorism may be considered as the fundamental prin 
ciple and supreme rule of all scientific terminology it is asserted 
by cuvier speaking of a particular case thus he says of 

 regne animal introd viii 
vol i 



lxxiv aphorisms concerning 

gmelin that by placing the lamantin in the genus of morses and 
the siren in the genus of eels he had rendered every general pro 
position respecting the organization of those genera impossible 

the maxim is true of words appropriated as well as invented 
and applies equally to the mathematical chemical and classifi 
catory sciences with regard to most of these and especially the 
two former classes it has been abundantly exemplified already in 
what has previously been said and in the history of the sciences 
for we have there had to notice many technical terms with the 
occasions of their introduction and all these occasions have 
involved the intention of expressing in a convenient manner some 
truth or supposed truth the terms of astronomy were adopted 
for the purpose of stating and reasoning upon the relations of the 
celestial motions according to the doctrine of the sphere and the 
other laws which were discovered by astronomers the few 
technical terms which belong to mechanics force velocity mo 
mentum inertia see were employed from the first with a view 
to the expression of the laws of motion and of rest and were in 
the end limited so as truly and simply to express those laws when 
they were fully ascertained in chemistry the term phlogiston 
was useful as has been shown in the history in classing toge 
ther processes which really are of the same nature and the 
nomenclature of the oxygen theory was still preferable because it 
enabled the chemist to express a still greater number of general 
truths 

to the connexion here asserted of theory and nomenclature 
we have the testimony of the author of the oxygen theory in 
the preface to his chemistry lavoisier says thus while i 
thought myself employed only in forming a nomenclature and 
while i proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the 
chemical language my work transformed itself by degrees with 
out my being able to prevent it into a treatise on the elements 
of chemistry and he then proceeds to show how this hap 
pened 

it is however mainly through the progress of natural history 
in modern times that philosophers have been led to see the import 
ance and necessity of new terms in expressing new truths thus 



the language of science lxxy 

harvey in the preface to his work on generation says be 
not offended if in setting out the history of the egg i make use 
of a new method and sometimes of unusual terms for as they 
which find out a new plantation and new shores call them by 
names of their own coining which posterity afterwards accepts 
and receives so those that find out new secrets have good title to 
their compellation and here methinks i hear galen advising 
if we consent in the things contend not about the words 

the nomenclature which answers the purposes of natural 
history is a systematic nomenclature and will be further consi 
dered under the next aphorism but we may remark that the 
aphorism now before us governs the use of words not in science 
only but in common language also are we to apply the name 
fish to animals of the whale kind i the answer is determined by 
our present rule we are to do so or not accordingly as we can 
best express true propositions if we are speaking of the internal 
structure and physiology of the animal we must not call them 
fish for in these respects they deviate widely from fishes they 
have warm blood and produce and suckle their young as land 
quadrupeds do but this would not prevent our speaking of the 
whalefishery and calling such animals fish on all occasion con 
nected with this employment for the relations thus arising depend 
upon the animals living in the water and being caught in a 
manner similar to other fishes a plea that human laws which 
mention fish do not apply to whales would be rejected at once by 
an intelligent judge 



aphorism ix 

in the classifcatory sciences a systematic nomenclature is neces 
sary and the system and the nomenclature are each essential 
to the utility of the other 

the inconveniences arising from the want of a good nomen 
clature were long felt in botany and are still felt in mineralogy 
the attempts to remedy them by synonymies are very ineffective 



lxxv aphorisms concerning 

for such comparisons of synonymes do not supply a systematic no 
menclature and such a one alone can enable us to state general 
truths respecting the objects of which the classificatory sciences 
treat the system and the names ought to be introduced together 
for the former is a collection of asserted analogies and resem 
blances for which the latter provide simple and permanent ex 
pressions hence it has repeatedly occurred in the progress of 
natural history that good systems did not take root or produce 
any lasting effect among naturalists because they were not accom 
panied by a corresponding nomenclature in this way as we have 
already noticed the excellent botanical system of csesalpinus was 
without immediate effect upon the science the work of wil 
loughby as cuvier says forms an epoch and a happy epoch in 
ichthyology yet because willoughby had no nomenclature of his 
own and no fixed names for his genera his immediate influence 
was not great again in speaking of schlotheinis work con 
taining representations of fossil vegetables m adolphe brong 
niart observes f that the figures and descriptions are so good that 
if the author had established a nomenclature for the objects he 
describes his work would have become the basis of all succeeding 
labours on the same subject 

as additional examples of cases in which the improvement of 
classification in recent times has led philosophers to propose new 
names i may mention the term pcecilite proposed by mr cony 
beare to designate the group of strata which lies below the oolites 
and lias including the new red or variegated sandstone with the 
keuper above and the magnesian limestone below it again the 
transition districts of our island have recently been reduced to 
system by professor sedgwick and mr murchison and this step 
has been marked by the terms cambrian system and silurian 
system applied to the two great groups of formations which they 
have respectively examined and by several other names of the 
subordinate members of these formations 

thus system and nomenclature are each essential to the other 
without nomenclature the system is not permanently incor 

 hist dcs poissons pref t prjdrom veg foss p 



the language of science lxxvii 

porated into the general body of knowledge and made an 
instrument of future progress without system the names can 
not express general truths and contain no reason why they should 
he employed in preference to any other names 

this has been generally acknowledged by the most philosophi 
cal naturalists of modern times thus linnaeus begins that part 
of his botanical philosophy in which names are treated of by 
stating that the foundation of botany is twofold disposition and 
denomination and he adds this latin line 

nomina si nescis perit et cognitio remm 

and cuvier in the preface to his animal kingdom explains in 
a very striking manner how the attempt to connect zoology with 
anatomy led him at the same time to reform the classifications 
and to correct the nomenclature of preceding zoologists 

i have stated that in mineralogy we are still destitute of a 
good nomenclature generally current from what has now been 
said it will be seen that it may be very far from easy to supply 
this defect since we have as yet no generally received system 
of mineralogical classification till we know what are really 
different species of minerals and in what larger groups these spe 
cies can be arranged so as to have common properties we shall 
never obtain a permanent mineralogical nomenclature thus 
leucocydite and tesselite are minerals previously confounded 
with apophyllite which sir john herschel and sir david 
brewster distinguished by those names in consequence of certain 
optical properties which they exhibit but are these properties 
definite distinctions and are there any external differences cor 
responding to them if not can we consider them as separate 
species and if not separate species ought they to have sepa 
rate names in like manner we might ask if augite and horn 
blende are really the same species as gustavus rose has main 
tained if diallage and hyperstkene are not definitely distin 
guished which has been asserted by kobell till such questions 
are settled we cannot have a fixed nomenclature in mineralogy 
what appears the best course to follow in the present state of the 
science i shall consider when we come to speak of the form of 
technical terms 



lxxvlii aphorisms concerning 

i may however notice here that the main forms of systema 
tic nomenclature are two terms which are produced by com 
bining words of higher and lower generality as the binary names 
consisting of the name of the genus and the species generally 
employed by natural historians since the time of linnaeus and 
terms in which some relation of things is indicated by a change 
in the form of the word for example an alteration of its termina 
tion of which kind of nomenclature we have a conspicuous 
example in the modern chemistry 

aphorism x 

new terms and changes ofterms which are not needed in order to 
express truth are to be avoided 

as the seventh aphorism asserted that novelties in language 
may be and ought to be introduced when they aid the enunciation 
of truths we now declare that they are not admissible in any other 
case new terms and new systems of terms are not to be intro 
duced for example in virtue of their own neatness or symmetry 
or other merits if there is no occasion for their use 

i may mention as an old example of a superfluous attempt of 
this kind an occurrence in the history of astronomy in 
john bayer and julius schiller devised a ccelum christianum 
in which the common names of the planets c were replaced by 
those of adam moses and the patriarchs the twelve signs 
became the twelve apostles and the constellations became sacred 
places and things peireskius who had to pronounce upon the 
value of this proposal praised the piety of the inventors but did 
not approve he said the design of perverting and confounding 
whatever of celestial information from the period of the earliest 
memory is found in books 

nor are slight anomalies in the existing language of science 
sufficient ground for a change if they do not seriously interfere 
with the expression of our knowledge thus linnaeus saysf 
that a fair generic name is not to be exchanged for another 
though apter one and j if we separate an old genus into several 

 gassendi vita pwreskii t phil bot 



the language of science 

we must try to find names for them among the synonyms which 
describe the old genus this maxim excludes the restoration 
of ancient names long disused no less than the needless in 
vention of new ones linnaeus lays down this rule and adds 
that the botanists of the sixteenth century well nigh ruined botany 
by their anxiety to recover the ancient names of plants in like 
manner cuvierf laments it as a misfortune that he has had to 
introduce many new names and declares earnestly that he has 
taken great pains to preserve those of his predecessors 

the great bulk which the synonymy of botany and of mine 
ralogy have attained shows us that this maxim has not been 
universally attended to in these cases however the multiplica 
tion of different names for the same kind of object has arisen in 
general from ignorance of the identity of it under different circum 
stances or from the want of a system which might assign to it its 
proper place but there are other instances in which the multi 
plication of names has arisen not from defect but from excess of 
the spirit of system the love which speculative men bear 
towards symmetry and completeness is constantly at work to 
make them create systems of classification more regular and more 
perfect than can be verified by the facts and as good systems 
are closely connected with a good nomenclature systems thus 
erroneous and superfluous lead to a nomenclature which is preju 
dicial to science for although such a nomenclature is finally 
expelled when it is found not to aid us in expressing the true 
laws of nature it may obtain some temporary sway during 
which and even afterwards it may be a source of much confusion 

we have a conspicuous example of such a result in the geo 
logical nomenclature of werner and his school thus it was 
assumed in werners system that his first second and third 
flotz limestone his old and new red sandstone were universal 
formations and geologists looked upon it as their business to 
detect these strata in other countries names were thus assigned 
to the rocks of various parts of europe which created immense 
perplexity before they were again ejected the geological terms 
which now prevail for instance those of smith are for the most 
 phil jbotj t regne animj pref p xvi 



lxxx aphorisms concerning 

part not systematic but are borrowed from accidents as localities 
or popular names as oxford clay and cornbrash and hence 
they are not liable to be thrust out on a change of system on the 
other hand we do not find sufficient reason to accept the system of 
names of strata proposed by mr conybeare m the introduction to 
the geology of england and wales according to which the car 
boniferous rocks are the medial order having above them the 
supermedial order new red sand oolites and chalk and above 
these the superior order tertiary rocks and again having 
below the submedial order the transition rocks and the 
inferior order mica slate gneiss granite for though these 
names have long been proposed it does not appear that they are 
useful in enunciating geological truths we may it would seem 
pronounce the same judgment respecting the system of geological 
names proposed by m alexander brongniart in his tableau 
des terrains qui composent pecorce du globe he divides these 
strata into nine classes which he terms terrains alluviens 
lysiens pyrogenes clysmiens yzemiens hemilysiens agaly 
siens plutoniques vulcaniques these classes are again variously 
subdivided fhus the terrains yzemiens are thalassiques pela 
giques and abyssiques and the abyssiques are subdivided into 
lias keuper conchiliens pceciliens peneens rudimentaires 
entritiques houillers carbonifers and gres rouge ancien 
scarcely any amount of new truths would induce geologists to 
burthen themselves at once with this enormous system of new 
names but in fact it is evident that any portion of truth which 
any author can have brought to light may be conveyed by means 
of a much simpler apparatus such a nomenclature carries its 
condemnation on its own face 

nearly the same may be said of the systematic nomencla 
ture proposed for mineralogy by professor mohs even if all 
his genera be really natural groups a doctrine which we can 
have no confidence in till they are confirmed by the evidence of 
chemistry there is no necessity to make so great a change in 
the received names of minerals his proceeding in this respect 
so different from the temperance of linnaeus and cuvier has 
probably ensured a speedy oblivion to this part of his system 



the language of science lxxxl 

in crystallography on the other hand in which mohss improve 
ments have been very valuable there are several terms introduced 
by him as rhombohedron scalenohedron hemihedral systems of 
crystallization which will probably be a permanent portion of 
the language of science 

i may remark in general that the only persons who succeed 
in making great alterations in the language of science are not 
these who make names arbitrarily and as an exercise of ingenuity 
but those who have much new knowledge to communicate so 
that the vehicle is commended to general reception by the value 
of what it contains it is only eminent discoverers to whom the 
authority is conceded of introducing a new system of names 
just as it is only the highest authority in the state which has the 
power of putting a new coinage in circulation 

i will here quote some judicious remarks of mr howard which 
fall partly under this aphorism and partly under some which 
follow he had proposed as names for the kinds of clouds the 
following cirrus cirrocumulus cirrostratus cumulostratus 
cumulus nimbus stratus in an abridgment of his views given 
in the supplement to the encyclopaedia britannica english names 
were proposed as the equivalents of these curlcloud sonder 
cloud wanecloud twaincloud stackencloud eaincloud fall 
cloud upon these mr howard observes i mention these in 
order to have the opportunity of saying that i do not adopt them 
the names for the clouds which i deduced from the latin are 
but seven in number and very easy to remember they were 
intended as arbitrary terms for the structure of clouds and the 
meaning of them was carefully fixed by a definition the ob 
server having once made himself master of this was able to apply 
the term with correctness after a little experience to the subject 
under all its varieties of form colour or position the new 
names if meant to be another set of arbitrary terms are super 
fluous if intended to convey in themselves an explanation in 
english they fail in this by applying to some part or circum 
stance only of the definition the whole of which must be kept in 
view to study the subject with success to take for an example 
the first of the modifications the term cirrus very readily takes 



lxxx aphorisms concerning 

an abstract meaning equally applicable to the rectilinear as to 
the flexuous forms of the subject but the name of curlcloud 
will not without some violence to its obvious sense acquire this 
more extensive one and will therefore be apt to mislead the 
reader rather than further his progress others of these names 
are as devoid of a meaning obvious to the english reader as the 
latin terms themselves but the principal objection to english 
or any other local terms remains to be stated they take away 
from the nomenclature its general advantage of constituting as 
far as it goes an universal language by means of which the intel 
ligent of every country may convey to each other their ideas 
without the necessity of translation 

i here adduce these as examples of the arguments against 
changing an established nomenclature as grounds of selecting 
a new one they may be taken into account hereafter 

aphorism xl 

terms which imply theoretical views are admissible as far as the 
theory is proved 

it is not unfrequently stated that the circumstances from 
which the names employed in science borrow their meaning 
ought to be facts and not theories but such a recommendation 
implies a belief that facts are rigorously distinguished from theories 
and directly opposed to them which belief we have repeatedly 
seen is unfounded when theories are firmly established they 
become facts and names founded on such theoretical views are 
unexceptionable if we speak of the minor axis of jupiters 
orbit or of his density or of the angle of refraction or the length 
of an undulation of red light we assume certain theories but 
nasmuch as the theories are now the inevitable interpretation of 
ascertained facts we can have no better terms to designate the 
conceptions thus referred to and hence the rule which we must 
follow is not that our terms must involve no theory but that 
they imply the theory only in that sense in which it is the inter 
pretation of the facts 

for example the term polarization of light was objected to 



the language of science lxxxlil 

as involving a theory perhaps the term was at first suggested 
by conceiving light to consist of particles having poles turned in 
a particular manner but among intelligent speculators the 
notion of polarization soon reduced itself to the simple conception 
of opposite properties in opposite positions which is a bare state 
ment of the fact and the term being understood to have this 
meaning is a perfectly good term and indeed the best which we 
can imagine for designating what is intended 

i need hardly add the caution that names involving theo 
retical views not in accordance with facts are to be rejected 
the following instances exemplify both the positive and the 
negative application of this maxim 

the distinction of primary and secondary rocks in geology 
was founded upon a theory namely that those which do not 
contain any organic remains were first deposited and afterwards 
those which contain plants and animals but this theory was 
insecure from the first the difficulty of making the separation 
which it implied led to the introduction of a class of transition 
rocks and the recent researches of geologists lead them to the 
conclusion that those rocks which are termed primary may be the 
newest not the oldest productions of nature 

in order to avoid this incongruity other terms have been pro 
posed as substitutes for these mr lyell remarks that granite 
gneiss and the like form a class which should be designated by 
a common name which name should not be of chronological 
import he proposes hypogene signifying netherformed and 
thus he adopts the theory that they have not assumed their 
present form and structure at the surface but determines nothing 
of the period when they were produced 

these hypogene rocks again he divides into unstratified or 
plutonic and altered stratified or metamorphic the latter term 
implying the hypothesis that the stratified rocks to which it is 
applied have been altered by the effect of fire or otherwise since 
they were deposited that fossiliferous strata in some cases at 
least have undergone such a change is demonstrable from facts f 

the modern nomenclature of chemistry implies the oxygen 

 prim geol iv t jelem geol p 



lxxxv aphorisms concerning 

theory of chemistry hence it has sometimes been objected to 
thus davy in speaking of the lavoisierian nomenclature makes 
the following remarks which however plausible they may sound 
will be found to be utterly erroneous simplicity and pre 
cision ought to be the characteristics of a scientific nomenclature 
words should signify things or the analogies of things and not 
opinions a substance in one age supposed to be simple in 
another is proved to be compound and vice versa a theoretical 
nomenclature is liable to continual alterations oxygenated muri 
atic acid is as improper a term as dephlogisticated marine acid 
every school believes itself to be in the right and if every school 
assumes to itself the liberty of altering the names of chemical 
substances in consequence of new ideas of their composition there 
can be no permanency in the language of the science it must 
always be confused and uncertain bodies which are similar to 
each other should always be classed together and there is a 
presumption that their composition is analogous metals earths 
alkalis are appropriate names for the bodies they represent and 
independent of all speculation whereas oxides sulphurets and 
muriates are terms founded upon opinions of the composition of 
bodies some of which have been already found erroneous the 
least dangerous mode of giving a systematic form to a language 
seems to be to signify the analogies of substances by some com 
mon sign affixed to the beginning or the termination of the word 
thus as the metals have been distinguished by a termination in 
um as aurum so their calciform or oxidated state might have 
been denoted by a termination in a as aura and no progress 
however great in the science could render it necessary that 
such a mode of appellation should be changed 

these remarks are founded upon distinctions which have no 
real existence we cannot separate things from their properties 
nor can we consider their properties and analogies in any other 
way than by having opinions about them by contrasting analo 
gies with opinions it might appear as if the author maintained 
that there were certain analogies about which there was no room 
for eironeous opinions yet the analogies of chemical compounds 
 elements of chem phil p 



the language of science lxxxv 

arc in fact those points which have heen most the subject of differ 
ence of opinion and on which the revolutions of theories have 
have most changed mens views as an example of analogies 
which are still recognized under alterations of theory the writer 
gives the relation of a metal to its oxide or calciform state but 
this analogy of metallic oxides as red copper or iron ore to calx 
or burnt lime is very far from being selfevident so far indeed 
that the recognition of the analogy was a great step in chemical 
theory the terms which he quotes oxygenated muriatic acid 
and the same may be said of dephlogisticated marine acid if 
improper are so not because they involve theory but because they 
involve false theory not because those who framed them did 
not endeavour to express analogies but because they expressed 
analogies about which they were mistaken unconnected names 
as metals earths alkalis are good as the basis of a systematic 
nomenclature but they are not substitutes for such a nomencla 
ture a systematic nomenclature is an instrument of great utility 
and power as the modern history of chemistry has shown it 
would be highly unphilosophical to reject the use of such an in 
strument because in the course of the revolutions of science we 
may have to modify or even to remodel it altogether its utility 
is not by that means destroyed it has retained transmitted and 
enabled us to reason upon the doctrines of the earlier theory so 
far as they are true and when this theory is absorbed into a 
more comprehensive one for this and not its refutation is the 
end of a theory so far as it is true the nomenclature is easily tran 
slated into that which the new theory introduces we have seen 
in the history of astronomy how valuable the theory of epicycles 
was in its time the nomenclature of the relations of a planets 
orbit which that theory introduced was one of keplers resources 
in discovering the elliptical theory and though now superseded 
is still readily intelligible to astronomers 

this is not the place to discuss the reasons for the form of 
scientific terms otherwise we might ask in reference to the 
objections to the lavoisierian nomenclature if such forms as 
aurum and aura are good to represent the absence or presence of 
oxygen why such forms as sulphite and sulphate are not equally 



lxxxv aphorisms concerning 

good to represent the presence of what we may call a smaller or 
larger dose of oxygen so long as the oxygen theory is admitted in 
its present form and to indicate still the difference of the same 
substances if under any change of theory it should come to be 
interpreted in a new manner 

but i do not now dwell upon such arguments my object in 
this place being to show that terms involving theory are not only 
allowable if understood so far as the theory is proved but of 
great value and indeed of indispensable use in science the ob 
jection to them is inconsistent with the objects of science if 
after all that has been done in chemistry or any other science we 
have arrived at no solid knowledge no permanent truth if all 
that we believe now may be proved to be false tomorrow then 
indeed our opinions and theories are corruptible elements on which 
it would be unwise to rest any thing important and which we 
might wish to exclude even from our names but if our knowledge 
has no more security than this we can find no reason why we 
should wish to have names of things since the names are needed 
mainly that we may reason upon and increase our knowledge such 
as it is if we are condemned to endless alternations of varying 
opinions then no doubt our theoretical terms may be a source of 
confusion but then where would be the advantage of their being 
otherwise what would be the value of words which should 
express in a more precise manner opinions equally fleeting it 
will perhaps be said our terms must express facts not theories 
but of this distinction so applied we have repeatedly shown the 
futility theories firmly established are facts is it not a fact 
that the rusting of iron arises from the metal combining with the 
oxygen of the atmosphere is it not a fact that a combination of 
oxygen and hydrogen produces water that our terms should 
express such facts is precisely what we are here inculcating 

our examination of the history of science has led us to a view 
very different from that which represents it as consisting in the 
succession of hostile opinions it is on the contrary a progress in 
which each step is recognized and employed in the succeeding one 
every theory so far as it is true and all that have prevailed ex 
tensively and long contain a large portion of truth is taken up 



the language of science lxxxv 

into the theory which succeeds and seems to expel it all the 
narrower inductions of the first are included in the more compre 
hensive generalizations of the second and this is performed 
mainly by means of such terms as we are now considering 
terms involving the previous theory it is by means of such 
terms that the truths at first ascertained become so familiar and 
manageable that they can be employed as elementary facts in the 
formation of higher inductions 

these principles must be applied also though with great cau 
tion and in a temperate manner even to descriptive language 
thus the mode of describing the forms of crystals adopted by 
werner and rome de tlsle was to consider an original form from 
which other forms are derived by truncatiom of the edges and the 
angles haiiys method of describing the same forms was to 
consider them as built up of rows of small solids the angles being 
determined by the decrements of these rows both these methods 
of description involve hypothetical views and the last was 
intended to rest on a true physical theory of the constitution of 
crystals both hypotheses are doubtful or false yet both these 
methods are good as modes of description nor is hattys termi 
nology vitiated if we suppose as in fact we must suppose in 
many instances that crystalline bodies are not really made up of 
such small solids the mode of describing an octahedron of fluor 
spar as derived from the cube by decrements of one row on all the 
edges would still be proper and useful as a description whatever 
judgment we should form of the material structure of the body 
but then we must consider the solids which are thus introduced 
into the description as merely hypothetical geometrical forms 
serving to determine the angles of the faces it is in this way 
alone that haiiys nomenclature can now be retained 

in like manner we may admit theoretical views into the 
descriptive phraseology of other parts of natural history and 
the theoretical terms will replace the obvious images in propor 
tion as the theory is generally accepted and familiarly applied 
for example in speaking of the honeysuckle we may say that 
the upper leaves are perfoliate meaning that a single orbicular 
leaf is perforated by the stalk or threaded upon it here is an 



lxxxv aphorisms concerning 

image which sufficiently conveys the notion of the form but it is 
now generally recognized that this apparent single leaf is in fact 
two opposite leaves joined together at their bases if this were 
doubted it may be proved by comparing the upper leaves with the 
lower which are really separate and opposite hence the term 
connate is applied to these conjoined opposite leaves implying that 
they grow together or they are called connatoperfoliate again 
formerly the corolla was called monopetalous or polypetalous as it 
consisted of one part or of several but it is now agreed among 
botanists that those corollas which appear to consist of a single 
part are in fact composed of several soldered together hence 
the term gamopetalous is now employed by decandolle and his 
followers instead of monopetalous 

in this way the language of natural history not only expresses 
but inevitably implies general laws of nature and words are 
thus fitted to aid the progress of knowledge in this as in other 
provinces of science 

aphorism xii 

if terms are systematically good they are not to be rejected because 
they are etymologically inaccurate 

terms belonging to a system are defined not by the meaning 
of their radical words but by their place in the system that 
they should be appropriate in their signification aids the processes 
of introducing and remembering them and should therefore be 
carefully attended to by those who invent and establish them 
but this once done no objections founded upon their etymo 
logical import are of any material weight we find no inconve 
nience in the circumstance that geometry means the measuring of 
the earth that the name porphyry is applied to many rocks which 
have no fiery spots as the word implies and oolite to strata which 
have no roelike structure in like manner if the term pwcilite 

 on this subject see illiger versuch einer systematischen vollstandigen 
terminologie fur das thierreich und pflanzenreich decandolle 
theorie elementaire de la botanique

were already generally received as the name of a certain group of 
strata it would be no valid ground for quarreling with it that this 
group was not always variegated in colour or that other groups 
were equally variegated although undoubtedly in introducing such 
a term care should be taken to make it as distinctive as possible 
it often happens as we have seen that by the natural progress of 
changes in language a word is steadily confirmed in a sense quite 
different from its etymological import but though we may 
accept such instances we must not wantonly attempt to imitate 
them i say not wantonly for if the progress of scientific iden 
tification compel us to follow any class of objects into circum 
stances where the derivation of the term is inapplicable we may 
still consider the term as an unmeaning sound or rather an his 
torical symbol expressing a certain member of our system thus 
if in following the course of the mountain or carboniferous lime 
stone we find that in ireland it does not form mountains nor 
contain coal we should act unwisely in breaking down the 
nomenclature in which our systematic relations are already ex 
pressed in order to gain in a particular case a propriety of lan 
guage which has no scientific value 

all attempts to act upon the maxim opposite to this and to 
make our scientific names properly descriptive of the objects have 
failed and must fail for the marks which really distinguish the 
natural classes of objects are by no means obvious the discovery 
of them is one of the most important steps in science and when 
they are discovered they are constantly liable to exceptions 
because they do not contain the essential differences of the classes 
the natural order umbellatw in order to be a natural order must 
contain some plants which have not umbels as eryngium in 
such cases said linnaeus it is of small import what you call 
the order if you take a proper series of plants and give it some 
name which is clearly understood to apply to the plants you have 
associated i have he adds followed the rule of borrowing 
the name a fortiori from the principal feature 

the distinction of crystals into systems according to the degree 
of symmetry which obtains in them has been explained elsewhere 
see hist tnd sd iii 

vol i g 



xc aphorisms concerning 

two of these systems of which the relation as to symmetry might 
be expressed by saying that one is square pyramidal and the other 
oblong pyramidal or the first square prismatic and the second 
oblong prismatic are termedby mohs the first pyramidal and the 
second prismatic and it may be doubted whether it is worth 
while to invent other terms though these are thus defective in 
characteristic significance as an example of a needless rejection 
of old terms in virtue of a supposed impropriety in their mean 
ing i may mention the attempt made in the last edition of haiiys 
mineralogy to substitute autopside and heteropside for metallic and 
unmetattic it was supposed to be proved that all bodies have 
a metal for their basis and hence it was wished to avoid the term 
unmetattic but the words metallic and unmetattic may mean 
that minerals seem metallic and unmetallic just as well as if they 
contained the element opside to imply this seeming the old 
names express all that the new express and with more simpli 
city and therefore should not be disturbed 

the maxim on which we are now insisting that we are not to 
be too scrupulous about the etymology of scientific terms may at 
first sight appear to be at variance with our fourth aphorism that 
words used technically are to retain their common meaning as far as 
possible but it must be recollected that in the fourth aphorism 
we spoke of common words appropriated as technical terms we 
here speak of words constructed for scientific purposes and 
although it is perhaps impossible to draw a broad line between 
these two classes of terms still the rule of propriety may be 
stated thus in technical terms deviations from the usual mean 
ing of words are bad in proportion as the words are more familiar 
in our own language thus we may apply the term cirrus 
to a cloud composed of filaments even if these filaments are 
straight but to call such a cloud a curl cloud would be much 
more harsh 

since the names of things and of classes of things when con 
structed so as to involve a description are constantly liable to be 
come bad the natural classes shifting away from the descriptive 
marks thus prematurely and casually adopted i venture to lay 
down the following maxim 



the language of science 



aphorism xiii 

the fundamental terms of a system of nomenclature may be conve 
niently borrowed from casual or arbitrary circumstances 

for instance the names of plants of minerals and of geolo 
gical strata may be taken from the places where they occur con 
spicuously or in a distinct form as parietaria parnassia chal 
cedony arragonite silurian system purbeck limestone these 
names may be considered as at first supplying standards of refer 
ence for in order to ascertain whether any rock be purbeck lime 
stone we might compare it with the rocks in the isle of purbeck 
but this reference to a local standard is of authority only till the 
place of the object in the system and its distinctive marks are 
ascertained it would not vitiate the above names if it were 
found that the parnassia does not grow on parnassus that 
chalcedony is not found in chalcedon or even that arragon 
ite no longer occurs in arragon for it is now firmly established 
as a mineral species even in geology such a reference is arbi 
trary and may be superseded or at least modified by a more sys 
tematic determination alpine limestone is no longer accepted 
as a satisfactory designation of a rock now that we know the 
limestone of the alps to be of various ages 

again names of persons either casually connected with the 
object or arbitrarily applied to it may be employed as designa 
tions this has been done most copiously in botany as for ex 
amenicotiana daliliafucjmajungermannia lonicera and 
linnaeus has laid down rules for restricting this mode of per 
petuating the memory of men in the names of plants those 
generic names he says which have been constructed to preserve 
the memory of persons who have deserved well of botany are to 
be religiously retained this he adds is the sole and supreme 
reward of the botanists labours and must be carefully guarded 
and scrupulously bestowed as an encouragement and an 
honour still more arbitrary are the terms borrowed from 
the names of the gods and goddesses heroes and heroines of 
 phil bot

antiquity to designate new genera in those departments of 
natural history in which so many have been discovered in 
recent times as to weary out all attempts at descriptive nomen 
clature cuvier has countenanced this method i have had to 
frame many new names of genera and subgenera he says 
 for the subgenera which i have established wer u so numerous 
and various that the memory is not satisfied with numerical in 
dications these i have chosen either so as to indicate some cha 
racter or among the usual denominations which i have latinized 
or finally after the example of linnaeus among the names of 
mythology which are in general agreeable to the ear and which 
are far from being exhausted 

this mode of framing names from the names of persons to 
whom it was intended to do honour has been employed also in 
the mathematical and chemical sciences but such names have 
rarely obtained any permanence except when they recorded an 
inventor or discoverer some of the constellations indeed have 
retained such appellations as berenices hair and the new star 
which shone out in the time of csesar would probably have re 
tained the name given to it of the julian star if it had not 
disappeared again soon after in the map of the moon almost 
all the parts have had such names imposed upon them by those who 
have constructed such maps and these names have very properly 
been retained but the names of new planets and satellites thus 
suggested have not been generally accepted as the medicean 
stars the name employed by galileo for the satellites of jupiter 
the georgium sidus the appellation proposed by herschel for 
uranus when first discovered ceres ferdinandea the name 
which piazzi wished to impose on the small planet ceres the 
names given to astronomical tables by the astronomers who con 
structed them have been most steadily adhered to being indeed 
names of books and not of natural objects thus there were 
the ilchanic the alphonsine the rudolphine the carolinian 
tables comets which have been ascertained to be periodical 
have very properly had assigned to them the name of the person 
 who established this point and of these we have thus halles 
 regne an p xvi 



the language of science xclii 

enckes and gambarfs comets the latter is often unjustly 
called bielas comet 

in the case of discoveries in science or inventions of appa 
ratus the name of the inventor is very properly employed as the 
designation thus we have the torricellian r acuum the voltaic 
pile fahrenheits thermometer and in the same manner with 
regard to laws of nature we have keplers laws boyle or mari 
ottes law of the elasticity of air huyghenss law of double refrac 
tion newtons scale of colours descartes law of refraction is an 
unjust appellation for the discovery of the law of sines was made 
by snell in deductive mathematics where the invention of a 
theorem is generally a more definite step than an induction this 
mode of designation is more common as demoivre theorem 
maclaurins theorem lagranges theorem eulerian integrals 

in the history of science i have remarked that in the dis 
covery of what is termed galvanism voltas office was of a higher 
and more philosophical kind than that of galvani and i have 
on this account urged the propriety of employing the term vol 
taic rather than galvanic electricity i may add that the elec 
tricity of the common machine is often placed in contrast with 
this and appears to require an express name mr faraday calls 
it common or machine electricity but i think that franklinic 
electricity would form a more natural correspondence with vol 
taic and would be well justified by franklins place in the his 
tory of that part of the subject 

aphorism xiv 

in forming a terminology words may be invented when necessary 
but they cannot be conveniently borrowed from casual or arbi 
trary circumstances 

it will be recollected that terminology is a language em 
ployed for describing objects nomenclature a body of names of 
the objects themselves the names as was stated in the last 
maxim may be arbitrary but the descriptive terms must be 



xcv aphorisms concerning 

borrowed from words of suitable meaning in the modern or the 
classical languages thus the whole terminology which linnaeus 
introduced into botany is founded upon the received use of latin 
words although he defined their meaning so as to make it precise 
when it was not so according to aphorism v but many of the 
terms were invented by him and other botanists as perianth 
nectary pericarp so many indeed as to form along with the 
others a considerable language many of the terms which are 
now become familiar were originally invented by writers on 
botany thus the word petal for one division of the corolla was 
introduced by fabius columna the term sepal was devised by 
neckar to express each of the divisions of the calyx and up 
to the most recent times new denominations of parts and con 
ditions of parts have been devised by botanists when they found 
them necessary in order to mark important differences or resem 
blances thus the general receptacle of the flower as it is 
termed by linnaeus or torus by salisbury is continued into organs 
vhich carry the stamina and pistil or the pistil alone or the 
whole flower this organ has hence been termed gonophore 
carpophore and anthophore in these cases 

in like manner when cuvier had ascertained that the lower 
jaws of saurians consisted always of six pieces having definite re 
lations of form and position he gave names to them and termed 
them respectively the dental the angular the coronoid the articu 
lar the complementary and the opercular bones 

in all these cases the descriptive terms thus introduced have 
been significant in their derivation an attempt to circulate a 
perfectly arbitrary word as a means of description would probably 
be unsuccessful we have indeed some examples approaching 
to arbitrary designations in the wernerian names of colours 
which are a part of the terminology of natural history many 
of these names are borrowed from natural resemblances as auri 
cula purple apple green straw yellow but the names of others 
are taken from casual occurrences mostly however such as were 
already recognized in common language as prussian blue dutch 
orange kings yellow

the extension of arbitrary names in scientific terminology is 
by no means to be encouraged i may mention a case in which 
it was very properly avoided when mr faradays researches 
on voltaic electricity had led him to perceive the great impro 
priety of the term poles as applied to the apparatus since the 
processes have not reference to any opposed points but to two 
opposite directions of a path he very suitably wished to substi 
tute for the phrases positive pole and negative pole two words end 
ing in ode from osos a way a person who did not see the 
value of our present maxim that descriptive terms should be de 
scriptive in their origin might have proposed words perfectly 
arbitrary as alphode and betode or if he wished to pay a tribute 
of respect to the discoverers in this department of science gal 
vanode and vouaode but such words would very justly have 
been rejected by mr faraday and would hardly have obtained 
any general currency among men of science zincode and pla 
tinode terms derived from the metal which in one modification 
of the apparatus forms what was previously termed the pole are 
to be avoided because in their origin too much is casual 
and they are not a good basis for derivative terms the pole 
at which the zinc is is the anode or cathode according as it 
is associated with different metals either the zincode must some 
times mean the pole at which the zinc is and at other times that 
at which the zinc is not or else we must have as many names 
for poles as there are metals anode and cathode the terms 
which mr faraday adopted were free from these objections for 
they refer to a natural standard of the direction of the voltaic 
current in a manner which though perhaps not obvious at first 
sight is easily understood and retained anode and cathode 
the rising and the setting way are the directions which corre 
spond to east and west in that voltaic current to which we must 
ascribe terrestrial magnetism and with these words it was easy 
to connect ariion and catjiion to designate the opposite elements 
which are separated and liberated at the two electrodes 

the following aphorisms respect the form of technical 
terms 

by the form of terms i mean their philological conditions 



xcv aphorisms concerning 

as for example from what languages they may be borrowed by 
what modes of inflexion they must be compounded how their 
derivatives are to be formed and the like in this as in other 
parts of the subject i shall not lay down a system of rules but 
shall propose a few maxims 

aphorism xv 

the two main conditions of the form of technical terms are that 
they must be generally intelligible and susceptible of such gram 
matical relations as their scientific use requires 

these conditions may at first appear somewhat vague but it 
will be found that they are as definite as we could make them 
without injuriously restricting ourselves it will appear more 
over that they have an important bearing upon most of the ques 
tions respecting the form of the words which come before us 
and that if we can succeed in any case in reconciling the two 
conditions we obtain terms which are practically good whatever 
objections may be urged against them from other considerations 

 the former condition for instance bears upon the 
question whether scientific terms are to be taken from the 
learned languages greek and latin or from our own 
and the latter condition very materially affects the same ques 
tion since in english we have scarcely any power of inflect 
ing our words and therefore must have recourse to greek or 
latin in order to obtain terms which admit of grammatical modi 
fication if we were content with the term heat to express the 
science of heat still it would be a bad technical term for we 
cannot derive from it an adjective like thermotical if bed or 
layer were an equally good term with stratum we must still retain 
the latter in order that we may use the derivative stratification 
for which the english words cannot produce an equivalent sub 
stitute we may retain the words lime andyfovztf but their adjec 
tives for scientific purposes are not limy and flinty but calcareous 
and siliceous and hence we are able to form a compound as 
calcareo siliceous which we could not do with indigenous

words we might fix the phrases bent back and broken to mean 
of optical rays that they are reflected and refracted but then 
we should have no means of speaking of the angles of reflection 
and refraction of the refractive indices and the like 

thus one of the advantages of going to the greek and latin 
languages for the origin of our scientific terms is that in this way 
we obtain words which admit of the formation of adjectives and 
abstract terms of composition and of other inflexions another 
advantage of such an origin is that such terms if well selected 
are readily understood over the whole lettered world for this 
reason the descriptive language of science of botany for instance 
has been for the most part taken from the latin many of the 
terms of the mathematical and chemical sciences have been 
derived from the greek and when occasion occurs to construct 
a new term it is generally to that language that recourse is had 
the advantage of such terms is as has already been intimated 
that they constitute an universal language by means of which 
cultivated persons in every country may convey to each other 
their ideas without the need of translation 

on the other hand the advantage of indigenous terms is 
that so far as the language extends they are intelligible much 
more clearly and vividly than those borrowed from any other 
source as well as more easily manageable in the construction of 
sentences in the descriptive language of botany for example 
in an english work the terms drooping nodding onesided 
twining straggling appear better than cernuous nutant secund 
wlubile divaricate for though the latter terms may by habit 
become as intelligible as the former they cannot become more so 
to any readers and to most english readers they will give a far 
less distinct impression 

 since the advantage of indigenous over learned terms or 
the contrary depends upon the balance of the capacity of inflexion 
and composition on the one hand against a ready and clear signi 
ficance on the other it is evident that the employment of scientific 
terms of the one class or of the other may very properly be ex 
tremely different in different languages the german possesses 
in a very eminent degree that power of composition and derivation 



xcv aphorisms concerning 

which in english can hardly be exercised at all in a formal 
manner hence german scientific writers use native terms to a 
far greater extent than do our own authors the descriptive 
terminology of botany and even the systematic nomenclature of 
chemistry are represented by the germans by means of german 
roots and inflexions thus the description of potentilla anserina 
in english botanists is that it has leaves interruptedly pinnate 
serrate silky stem creeping stalks axillar oneflowered here 
we have words of saxon and latin origin mingled pretty equally 
but the german description is entirely teutonic die blume in 
achsel die blatter unterbrochen gefiedert die bldttchen scharf 
gesagt die stdmme kriechend die bluthenstiele eiiiblumig we 
could imitate this in our own language by saying brokenly 
feathered sharpsawed by using threed for ternate as the ger 
mans employ gedreit by saying fingered feathered for digitato 
pinnate and the like but the habit which we have in common 
as well as in scientific language of borrowing words from the 
latin for new cases would make such usages seem very harsh 
and pedantic 

we may add that in consequence of these different practices 
in the two languages it is a common habit of the german reader 
to impose a scientific definiteness upon a common word such as 
our fifth aphorism requires whereas the english reader expects 
rather that a word which is to have a technical sense shall be 
derived from the learned languages die kelch and die blume 
the cup and the flower easily assume the technical meaning of 
calyx and corolla die griffel the pencil becomes the pistil 
and a name is easily found for the pollen the anthers and the 
stamens by calling them the dust the dustcases and the dust 
threads der staub die staubbeutel or staubfdcher and die staub 
fdden this was formerly done in english to a greater extent 
than is now possible without confusion and pedantry thus in 
grews book on the anatomy of plants the calyx is called the 
impalement and the sepals the impalers the petals are called 
the leaves of the flower the stamens with their anthers are the 
seminiform attire but the english language as to such mat 
ters is now less flexible than it then was partly in conse

quence of having adopted the linnsean terminology almost entire 
without any attempt to naturalise it for any attempt at idio 
matic description would interfere with the scientific language now 
generally received in this country in germany on the other 
hand those who wrote upon science in their own language imi 
tated the latin words which they found in foreign writers 
instead of transferring new roots into their own language thus 
the numerator and denominator of a fraction they called the namer 
and the counter iienner and zahler this course they pursued 
even where the expression was erroneous thus that portion 
of the intestines which ancient anatomists called duodenum 
because they falsely estimated its length at twelve inches the 
germans also term zwolffingerdarm twelveinchgut though 
this intestine in a whale is twenty feet long and in a frog not 
above twenty lines as another example of this process in ger 
man we may take the word muttersackbauchblatte the uterine 
peritonaeum 

it is a remarkable evidence of this formative power of the 
german language that it should have been able to produce 
an imitation of the systematic chemical nomenclature of the 
french school so complete that it is used in germany as fami 
liarly as the original system is in france and england thus 
oxygen and hydrogen are sauerstoff and wafferstoff azote is 
stickstoff suffocating matter sulphuric and sulphurous acid 
are schwefelsaure and schwefelichtesdure the sulphate and sul 
phite of baryta and sulphuret of baryum are schwefelsaure 
barijterde schwefelichtesaure baryterde and schwefelbaryum 
carbonate of iron is kohlensdures eisenoxydul and we may 
observe that in such cases the german name is much more agree 
able to anology than the english one for the protoxide of 
iron and not the iron itself is the base of the salt and the 
german language has not only thus imitated the established 
nomenclature of chemistry but has shown itself capable of sup 
plying new forms to meet the demands which the progress of 
theory occasions tims the hydracids are wasserstoffsduren 
and of these the hyclriodic acid is lodwasserstoffsaure and so 
of the rest in like manner the translator of berzelius has found 



c aphorisms concerning 

german names for the sulphosalts of that chemist thus he has 
wasserstoffschwefliges schwef ellithium which would be if we 
were to adopt his theoretical view hydrosulphuret of sulphuret 
of lithium and a like nomenclature for all other similar cases 

 in english we have no power of imitating this process 
and must take our technical phrases from some more flexible 
language and generally from the latin or greek we are indeed 
so much accustomed to do this that except a word has its origin 
in one of these languages it hardly seems to us a technical term 
and thus by employing indigenous terms even descriptive ones 
we may perhaps lose in precision more than we gain in the vivid 
ness of the impression perhaps it may be better to say cuneate 
lunate hastate sagittate reniform than wedgeshaped crescent 
shaped halbertheaded arrow headed kidneyshaped ringent and 
personate are better than any english words which we could sub 
stitute for them labiate is more precise than lipped would readily 
become urceolate trochlear are more compact than pitcher 
shaped pulley shaped and infundibuliform hypocrateriform 
though long words are not more inconvenient than funnelshaped 
and sahershaped in the same way it is better to speak with 
dr prichard of repent and progressive animals than of creeping 
and progressive the two latin terms make a better pair of cor 
relatives 

 but wherever we may draw the line between the proper use 
of english and latin terms in descriptive phraseology we shall 
find it advisable to borrow almost all other technical terms from 
the learned languages we have seen this in considering the 
new terms introduced into various sciences in virtue of our ninth 
maxim we may add as further examples the names of the 
various animals of which a knowledge has been acquired from 
the remains of them which exist in various strata and which 
have been reconstructed by cuvier and his successors such are 
the palceotlierium the anoplotherium the megatherium the 
dinotherium the chirotherium the megalichthys the mastodon 
the ichthyosaurus the plesiosaurus the pterodactylus to these 
others are every year added as for instance very recently the 

 researches p 



the language of science ci 

toxodon zeuglodon and phascolotherium of mr owen and the 
thylacotherium of m valenciennes the names of species as well 
as of genera are thus formed from the greek as the plesiosau 
rus dolickodeirus longnecked ichthyosaurus platyodon broad 
toothed the irish elk termed cervus megaceros largehorned 
but the descriptive specific names are also taken from the latin 
as plesiosaurus brevirottrif longirostris crassirostris besides 
which there are arbitrary specific names which we do not here 
consider these names being all constructed at a period when 
naturalists were familiar with an artificial system the standard 
language of which is latin have not been taken from modern 
language but the names of living animals and even of their 
classes long ago formed in the common language of men have 
been in part adopted in the systems of naturalists agreeably to 
aphorism third hence the language of systems in natural 
history is mixed of ancient and modern languages thus cuviers 
divisions of the vertebrated animals are mammiferes latin 
oiseaux beptiles poissons bimanes qtiadrumanes carnassieres 
rongeurs pacliydermes greek euminans latin cetaces 
latin in the subordinate divisions the distribution being 
more novel the names are less idiomatic thus the kinds of rep 
tiles are cheloniens sauriens ophidiens batriciens all which 
are of greek origin in like manner fish are divided into 
chondropterygiens malacopterygiens acanihopterygiens the 
unvertebrated animals are mollusques or animaux articules and 
animaux ray ounces and the former are divided into six classes 
according to the position of their foot namely cephalopodes 
pteropodes gasteropodes acephales brachiopodes cirrhopodes 

in transferring these terms into english when the term is 
new in french as well as english we have little difficulty for 
we may take nearly the same liberties in english which are 
taken in french and hence we may say mammifers rather 
mammals cetaceans or cetaces batracians rather latrachians 
using the words as substantives but in other cases we must go 
back to the latin thus we say radiate animals or radiata 
rather radials for rayonnees these changes however rather 
refer to another aphorism 



cli aphorisms concerning 

 when new mineral species have been established in recent 
times they have generally had arbitrary names assigned to them 
derived from some person or places in some instances however 
descriptive names have been selected and then these have been 
generally taken from the greek as auglte stilbite diaspore 
dichrolte dioptase several of these greek names imposed by 
haiiy refer to some circumstances often fancifully selected in 
his view of the crystallization of the substance as epidote peri 
dote pleonast similar terms of greek origin have been intro 
duced by others as orthite anorthite periklin greek names 
founded on casual circumstances are less to be commended 
berzelius has termed a mineral eschynite from aigyyvri shame 
because it is he conceives a shame for chemists not to have sepa 
rated its elements more distinctly than they did at first 

 in botany the old names of genera of greek origin are 
very numerous and many of them are descriptive as glycyrhiza 
yvicvs pla sweet root liquorice rhododendron rose tree 
hcematoxylon bloody wood chrysocoma golden hair alope 
curus fox tail and many more in like manner there are 
names which derive a descriptive significance from the latin 
either adjectives as impatiens gloriosa sagittaria or substan 
tives irregularly formed as tussilago atussis domatione urtica 
ab urendo tactu salsola a salsedine but these though good 
names when they are established by tradition are hardly to be 
imitated in naming new plants in most instances when this is 
to be done arbitrary or local names have been selected as stre 
litzia 

 in chemistry new substances have of late had names 
assigned them from greek roots as iodine from its violet colour 
chlorine from its green colour in like manner fluorine has by 
the french chemists been called phthor from its destructive 
properties so the new metals chrome rhodium iridium 
osmium had names of greek derivation descriptive of their pro 
perties some such terms however were borrowed from localities 
as strontia yttria the names of new earths others have a 
mixed origin as pyrogallic pyroacetic and pyroligneous spirit 
in some cases the deviation has been extravagantly capricious 



the language of science clll 

thus in the process for making pyrogallic acid a certain sub 
stance is left behind from which m braconnot extracted an acid 
which he called ellagic acid framing the root of the name by 
reading the word galle backwards 

the new laws which the study of electrochemistry brought 
into view required a new terminology to express their conditions 
and in this case as we have observed in speaking of the twelfth 
maxim arbitrary words are less suitable mr faraday very 
properly borrowed from the greek his terms electrolyte electrode 
anode cathode anion catkion dilectric in the mechanico 
chemical and mechanical sciences however new terms are less 
copiously required than in the sciences of classification and when 
they are needed they are generally determined by analogy from 
existing terms thermoelectricity and electrodynamics were terms 
which very naturally offered themselves nobilis thermomul 
tiplier snow harriss unitjar were almost equally obvious 
names in such cases it is generally possible to construct terms 
both compendious and descriptive without introducing any new 
radical words 

 the subject of crystallography has inevitably given rise to 
many new terms since it brings under our notice a great number 
of new relations of a very definite but very complex form 
haiiy attempted to find names for all the leading varieties of 
crystals and for this purpose introduced a great number of new 
terms founded on various analogies and allusions thus the 
forms of calcspar are termed by him primitive equiae inverse 
metastatique contrastante imitable birhomboidale prismatique 
apophane uniternaire bisunitaire dodecaedre contracted dilatce 
sexduodecimale bisalterne binoternaire and many others the 
want of uniformity in the origin and scheme of these denomina 
tions would be no valid objection to them if any general truth 
could be expressed by means of them but the fact is that there 
is no definite distinction of these forms they pass into each 
other by insensible gradations and the optical and physical pro 
perties which they possess are common to all of them and as 
a mere enunciation of laws of form this terminology is insuffi 
cient thus it does not at all convey the relation between the 



civ aphorisms concerning 

bisalterne and the binoternaire the former being a combination of 
the metastatique with the prismatique the latter of the metastique 
with the contrastante again the contrastante the mixte the 
cuboide the contractee the dilatee all contain faces generated by 
a common law the index being respectively altered so as to be in 
these cases f and this which is the most important geo 
metrical relation of these forms is not at all recorded or indicated 
by the nomenclature the fact is that it is probably impossible 
the subject of crystallography having become so complex as it 
now is to devise a system of names which shall express the rela 
tions of form numerical symbols such as those of weiss or 
naumann or professor miller are the proper ways of expressing 
these relations and are the only good crystallographic terminology 
for cases in detail 

the terms used in expressing crystallographic laws have 
been for the most part taken from the greek by all writers except 
some of the germans these we have already stated have 
constructed terms in their own language as zweiundein gliedrig 
and the like 

in optics we have some new terms connected with crystal 
line laws as uniaxal and biaxal crystals optical axes which 
offered themselves without any effort on the part of the discover 
ers in the whole history of the undulatory theory very few 
innovations in language were found necessary except to fix the 
sense of a few phrases as planepolarized light in opposition to 
circularly polarized and the like 

this is still more the case in mechanics astronomy and pure 
mathematics in these sciences several of the primary stages of 
generalization being already passed over when any new steps are 
made we have before us some analogy by which we may frame 
our new terms thus when the plane of maximum areas was 
discovered it had not some new arbitrary denomination assigned 
it but the name which obviously described it was fixed as a 
technical name 

the result of this survey of the scientific terms of recent 
formation seems to be this that indigenous terms may be 
employed in the descriptions of facts and phenomena as they at 



the language of science cv 

first present themselves and in the first induction from these 
but that when we come to generalize and theorize terms borrowed 
from the learned languages are more readily fixed and made 
definite and are also more easily connected with derivatives 
our native terms are more impressive and at first more intelli 
gible but they may wander from their scientific meaning and 
are capable of little inflexion words of classical origin are 
precise to the careful student and capable of expressing by their 
inflexions the relations of general ideas but they are unintelli 
gible even to the learned man without express definition and 
convey instruction only through an artificial and rare habit of 
thought 

since in the balance between words of domestic and of foreign 
origin so much depends upon the possibility of inflexion and 
derivation i shall consider a little more closely what are the 
limits and considerations which we have to take into account in 
reference to that subject 

aphorism xvi 

in the composition and inflexion of technical terms philological 
analogies are to be preserved if possible but modified according 
to scientific convenience 

in the language employed or proposed by writers upon sub 
jects of science many combinations and forms of derivation occur 
which would be rejected and condemned by those who are careful 
of the purity and correctness of language such anomalies are 
to be avoided as much as possible but it is impossible to escape 
them altogether if we are to have a scientific language which 
has any chance of being received into general use it is better 
to admit compounds which are not philologically correct than 
to invent many new words all strange to the readers for whom 
they are intended and in writing on science in our own lan 
guage it is not possible to avoid making additions to the voca 
bulary of common life since science requires exact names for 
many things which common language has not named and 

vol i h 



cv aphorisms concerning 

although these new names should as much as possible be 
constructed in conformity with the analogies of the language 
such extensions of analogy can hardly sound to the gram 
marians ear otherwise than as solecisms but as our maxim 
indicates the analogy of science is of more weight with us 
than the analogy of language and although anomalies in our 
phraseology should be avoided as much as possible innovations 
must be permitted wherever a scientific language easy to acquire 
and convenient to use is unattainable without them 

i shall proceed to mention some of the transgressions of strict 
philological rules and some of the extensions of grammatical forms 
which the above conditions appear to render necessary 

i the combination of different languages in the derivation 
of words though to be avoided in general is in some cases ad 
missible 

such words are condemned by quintilian and other gramma 
rians under the name of hybrids or things of a mixed race as 
biclinium from bis and klvri epitogium from evl and toga 
nor are such terms to be unnecessarily introduced in science 
whenever a homogeneous word can be formed and adopted with 
the same ease and convenience as a hybrid it is to be preferred 
hence we must have ichthyology not piscology entomology not 
insectology insectivorous not insectophagous in like manner it 
would be better to say unoculus than monoculus though the 
latter has the sanction of linnaeus who was a purist in such 
matters dr e turner in his chemistry speaks of protoxides and 
binoxides which combination violates the rule for making the 
materials of our terms as homogeneous as possible protoxide 
and deutoxide would be preferable both on this and on other 
accounts 

yet this rule admits of exceptions mineralogy with its 
greek termination has for its root minera a medieval latin word 
of teutonic origin and is preferable to oryctology terminology 
appears to be better than glossology which according to its deri 
vation would be rather the science of language in general than of 
technical terms and horology from opos a term would not be 
immediately intelligible even to greek scholars and is already 



the language of science cvii 

employed to indicate the science which treats of horologes or 
timepieces 

indeed the english reader is become quite familiar with the 
termination ology the names of a large number of branches 
of science and learning having that form this termination 
is at present rather apprehended as a formative affix in our 
own language indicating a science than as an element borrowed 
from a foreign language hence when it is difficult or imposs 
ible to find a greek term which clearly designates the subject of a 
science it is allowable to employ some other as in tidology the 
doctrine of the tides 

the same remark applies to some other greek elements of 
scientific words they are so familiar to us that in composition 
they are almost used as part of our own language this natu 
ralization has taken place very decidedly in the element arch 
dpxbs a leader as we see in archbishop archduke it is effected 
in a great degree for the preposition anti thus we speak of anti 
slavery societies antireformers antibilious or antiacid medi 
cines without being conscious of any anomaly the same is the 
ease with the latin preposition pro or pre as appears from such 
words as preengage prearrange prejudge prepaid and in 
some measure with pro for in colloquial language we speak of 
procatholics and anticatholics also the preposition ante is simi 
larly used asantenicene fathers the preposition co abbreviated 
from con and implying things to be simultaneous or connected 
is firmly established as part of the language as we see in coexist 
coheir coordinate hence i have called those lines cotidal lines 
which pass through places where the high water of the tide 
occurs simultaneously 

 as in the course of the mixture by which our language 
has been formed we have thus lost all habitual consciousness of 
the difference of its ingredients greek latin norman french 
and anglosaxon we have also ceased to confine to each ingre 
dient the mode of grammatical inflexion which originally belonged 
to it thus the termination ive belongs peculiarly to latin 
adjectives yet we say sportive talkative in like manner able is 
added to words which are not latin as eatable drinkable piti 



cviii aphorisms concerning 

able enviable also the termination al and ical are used with 
various roots as loyal royal farcical whimsical hence we may 
make the adjective tidal from tide this ending al is also 
added to abstract terms in ion as occasional provisional inten 
tional national hence we may if necessary use such words 
as educational terminational the ending ic appears to be suited 
to proper names as pindaric socratic platonic hence it may 
be used when scientific words are derived from proper names as 
voltaic or galvanic electricity to which i have proposed to add 
franklinic 

in adopting scientific adjectives from the latin we have not 
much room for hesitation for in such cases the habits of deri 
vation from that language into our own are very constant ivus 
becomes ive as decursive inus becomes ine as in ferine atus 
becomes ate as hastate and us often becomes ous as rufous aris 
becomes ary as axillary ens becomes ent as ringent and in 
adopting into our language as scientific terms words which in 
another language the french for instance have a latin origin 
familiar to us we cannot do better than form them as if they 
were derived directly from the latin hence the french adjec 
tives cetace crustace testace may become either cetaceous crusta 
ceous testaceous according to the analogy of farinaceous preda 
ceous or else cetacean crustacean testacean imitating the form 
of patrician since as i shall soon have to notice we require 
substantives as well as adjectives from these words we must at 
least for that use take the forms last suggested 

in pursuance of the same remark rongeur becomes rodent 
and edente would become edentate but that this word is rejected 
on another account the adjectives bimane and guadrumane are 
bimanous and quadrumanous 

 there is not much difficulty in thus forming adjectives 
but the purposes of natural history require that we should have 
substantive words corresponding to these adjectives and these 
cannot be obtained without some extension of the analogies of our 
language we cannot in general use adjectives or participles as 
singular substantives the happy or the doomed would according 
to good english usage signify those who are happy and those 



the language of science cix 

who are doomed hence we could not speak of a particular 
scaled animal as the squamate and still less could we call any such 
animal a squamate or speak of squamates in the plural some 
of the forms of our adjectives however do admit of this substan 
tive use thus we talk of europeans plebeians republicans of 
divines and masculines of the ultramontanes of mordants and 
brilliants of abstergents and emollients of mercenaries and tribu 
taries of animals manuals and officials of dissuasives and 
motives we cannot generally use in this way adjectives in ous 
nor in ate though reprobates is an exception nor english par 
ticiples nor adjectives in which there is no termination imitating 
the latin as happy good hence if we have for purposes of 
science to convert adjectives into substantives we ought to 
follow the form of examples like these in which it has already 
appeared in fact that such usage though an innovation at first 
may ultimately become a received part of the language 

by attention to this rule we may judge what expressions to 
select in cases where substantives are needed i will take as an 
example the division of the mammalian animals into orders 
these orders according to cuvier are bimanes quadrumanes 
carnassiers rongeurs edentes ruminans pachydermes cetaces 
bimanes quadrumanes rodents ruminants are admissible as 
english substantives on the grounds just stated cetaceous 
could not be used substantively but cetacean in such a usage is 
sufficiently countenanced by such cases as we have mentioned 
patrician c hence we adopt this form we have no english 
word equivalent to the french carnassiers the english trans 
lator of cuvier has not provided english words for his technical 
terms but has formed a latin word carnaria to represent the 
french terms from this we might readily form carnaries 
but it appears much better to take the linnsean name ferce as 
our root from which we may take ferine substantive as well as 
adjective and hence we call this order ferines the word for 
which it is most difficult to provide a proper representation is 
edente edentata for as we have said it would be very harsh to 
speak of the order as the edentates and if we were to abbreviate 
the word into edent we should suggest a false analogy with 



cx aphorisms concerning 

rodent for as rodent is quod rodit that which gnaws edent woum 
be quod edit that which eats and even if we were to take 
edent as a substantive we could hardly use it as an adjective 
we should still have to say for example the edentate form of 
head for these reasons it appears best to alter the form of the 
word and to call the order the edentals which is quite allow 
able both as adjective and substantive 

there are several other words in ate about which there is the 
same difficulty in providing substantive forms are we to speak 
of vertebrates or would it not be better in agreement with what 
has been said above to call these vertebrals and the opposite 
class invertebrate 

there are similar difficulties with regard to the names of sub 
ordinate portions of zoological classification thus the ferines are 
divided by cuvier into cheiropteres insectiwres carnivores 
and these latter into plantigrades digitigrades amphibies mar 
mpiaux there is not any great harshness in naturalizing these 
substantives as chiropters insectivores carnivores plantigrades 
digitigrades amphibians and marsupials the words carni 
vores and insectivores are better because of more familiar origin 
than greek terms otherwise we might if necessary speak of 
zoophagans and entomophagans 

it is only with certain familiar adjectival terminations as ous 
and ate that there is a difficulty in using the word as substantive 
when this can be avoided we readily accept the new word as 
pachyderms and in like manner mollusjcs 

if we examine the names of the orders of birds we find that 
they are in latin predator es or accipitres passer es scansores 
easores or gallinw grallatores palmipedes and anseres cuviers 
orders are oiseaux de proie passereaux grimpeurs gallina 
ces echassiers palmipedes these may be englished conveni 
ently as predators passerines scansors gallinaceans rather than 
rasors grallators palmipedans scansors grallatorsndirasor 
are better as technical terms than climbers waders and scratch 
ers we might venture to anglicize the terminations of the 
names which cuvier gives to the divisions of these orders thus 
the predators are the diurnals and the nocturnals the passer 



the language of science cxi 

ines are the dentirostres the fissirostres the conirostres the 
tenuirostres and the syndactyls the word lustre showing that 
the former termination is allowable the scansors are not sub 
divided nor are the gallinaceans the grallators are pressirostres 
cultrirostres and macrodactyls the palmipedans are the plung 
ers the longipens the totipalmes and the lamellirostres 

the next class of vertebrals is the reptiles and these are 
either chelonians saurians ophidians or batrachians cuvier 
writes batraciem but we prefer the spelling to which the greek 
word directs us 

the next class is the fishes in which province cuvier has 
himself been the great systematist and has therefore had to devise 
many new terms many of these are of greek or latin origin 
and can be anglicized by the analogies already pointed out as 
chondropterygians malacopterygians lophobranchs plectognaths 
gymnodonts scleroderms discoboles and apodes may be eng 
lish as well as french there are other cases in which the 
author has formed the names of families either by forming a 
word in ides from the name of a genus as gadoides gobioides 
or by gallicizing the latin name of the genus as salmones from 
salmo clupes from clupea esoces from esox cyprins from cy 
prinus in both these cases the best procedure seems to be to 
form the english substantive in idan as gadoidans gobioidans 
salmonidans clupeidans esocidans cyprinidans one of the 
orders of fishes coordinate with the chondropterygians and the 
lophobranchs is termed osseux by cuvier it appears hardly 
worth while to invent a substantive word for this when bony 
fishes is so simple a phrase and may readily be understood as a 
technical name of a systematic order 

the mollusks are the next class and these are divided into 
cephalopods gasteropods and the like the gasteropods are nu 
dibranchs infer obranchs tectibranchs pectinibranchs scuti 
branchs and cyclobranchs in framing most of these terms 
cuvier has made hybrids by a combination of a latin word with 
branchiae which is the greek name for the gills of a fish and 
has thus avoided loading the memory with words of an origin not 
obvious to most naturalists as terms derived from the greek 



cx aphorisms concerning 

would have been another division of the gasteropoda is pul 
mones which we must make pulmonians in like manner the 
subdivisions of the pectinibranchs are the trochoidans and bug 
einoidans trochdides buccindides the acephales another 
order of mollusks may be acephals in english 

after these comes the third grand division of articulated ani 
mals and these are annelidans crustaceans arachnidans and 
insects i shall not dwell upon the names of these as the form 
of english words which is to be selected must be sufficiently 
obvious from the preceding examples 

finally we have the fourth grand division of animals the 
llayonnes or radiata which for reasons already given we may 
call radials these are echinoderms intestinals acalephes and 
polyps the polyps which are composite animals in which many 
gelatinous individuals are connected so as to have a common life 
have in many cases a more solid framework belonging to the com 
mon part of the animal this framework of which coral is a 
special example is termed in french polypier the word has been 
anglicized by the word polypary after the analogy of amary and 
apiary thus polyps are either polyps with polyparies or naked 
polyps 

any common kind of polyps has usually in the english lan 
guage been called polypus the greek termination being retained 
this termination in us however whether latin or greek is to 
be excluded from the english as much as possible on account of 
the embarassment which it occasions in the formation of the 
plural for if we say polypi the word ceases to be english 
while polypuses is harsh and there is the additional inconveni 
ence that both these forms would indicate the plural of individuals 
rather than of classes if we were to say the corallines are a 
family of the polypuses with polyparies it would not at once 
occur to the reader that the three last words formed a technical 
phrase 

this termination us which must thus be excluded from the 
names of families may be admitted in the designation of genera 
of animals as nautilus echinus hippopotamus and of plants as 
crocus asparagus narcissus acanthus eanunculus fungus 



the language of science cxiii 

the same form occurs in other technical words as fucus mucus 
esophagus hydrocephalus callus calculus uterus foetus 
radius focus apparatus it is however advisable to retain 
this form only in cases where it is already firmly established in 
the language for a more genuine english form is preferable 
hence we say with mr lyell icthyosaur plesiosaur ptero 
dactyl in like manner mr owen anglicizes the termination 
erium and speaks of the anoplothere and paleothere 

since the wants of science thus demand adjectives which 
can be used also as substantive names of classes this consideration 
may sometimes serve to determine our selection of new terms 
thus mr lyelfs names for the subdivisions of the tertiary strata 
miocene pliocene can be used as substantives but if such words 
as mioneous plioneous had suggested themselves they must have 
been rejected though of equivalent signification as not fulfilling 
this condition 

 abstract substantives can easily be formed from ad 
jectives from electric we hve electricity from galvanic galvan 
ism from organic organization velocity lemty gravity are 
borrowed from latin adjectives caloric is familiarly used for 
the matter of heat though the form of the word is not supported 
by any obvious analogy 

 it is quite intolerable to have words regularly formed in 
opposition to the analogy which their meaning offers as when 
bodies are said to have conductibiliti or conducibility with regard 
to heat the bodies are conduct and their property is con 
ductivity 

 the terminations ize rather than ise ism and ist are 
applied to words of all origins thus we have to pulverize to 
colonize witticism heathenism journalist tobacconist hence 
we may make such words when they are wanted as we cannot 
use physician for a cultivator of physics i have called him a 
physicist we need very much a name to describe a cultivator 
of science in general i should incline to call him a scientist 
thus we might say that as an artist is a musician painter or 
poet a scientist is a mathematician physicist or naturalist 

 connected with verbs in ize we have abstract nouns in 



cxv aphorisms concerning 

ization as polarization crystallization these it appears proper 
to spell in english with z rather than s governing our practice 
by the greek verbal termination o which we imitate but we 
must observe that verbs and substantives in yse analyse belong 
to a different analogy giving an abstract noun in ysis and an 
adjective ytic or ytical analysis analytic analytical hence 
electrolyse is more proper than electrolyze 

 the names of many sciences end in ics after the analogy 
of mathematics metaphysics as optics mechanics but these in 
most other languages as in our own formerly have the singular 
form optice ioptique optik optick and though we now write 
optics we make such words of the singular number newtons 
opticks is an example as however this connexion in new 
words is startling as when we say thermoelectrics is now much 
cultivated it appears better to employ the singular form after 
the analogy of logic and rhetoric when we have words to con 
struct hence we may call the science of languages linguistic 
as it is called by the best german writers for instance william 
von humboldt 

 in the derivation of english from latin or greek words 
the changes of letters are to be governed by the rules which have 
generally prevailed in such cases the greek ol and ai the 
latin oe and ae are all converted into a simple e as in economy 
geodesy pnal cesar hence according to common usage 
we should write phenomena not phenomena paleontology not 
paleontology miocene not miocome pekilite not pcekilite but 
in order to keep more clearly in view the origin of our terms it 
may be allowable to deviate from these rules of change especially 
so long as the words are still new and unfamiliar dr buckland 
speaks of the poikilitic not pecilitic group of strata palaeontology 
is the spelling commonly adopted and in imitation of this i 
have vfiiitqtipalwtiology the diphthong et was by the latins 
changed into i as in aristdes and hence this has been the 
usual form in english some recent authors indeed mr mitford 
for instance write aristedes but the former appears to be the 
more legitimate hence we write nuocene pkocene not meio 
cene pliocene the greek t becomes y and ov becomes u in 



the language of science cxv 

english as in latin as crystal colure the consonants k and 
become c and ch according to common usage hence we write 
crystal not chrystal batracjian not batracian cryolite not cryo 
lite as however the letter c before and i differs from k which 
is the sound we assign to the greek k it may be allowable to use 
k in order to avoid this confusion thus as we have seen poiilite 
has been used as well as pecilite even in common language 
some authors write sceptic which appears to be better than scep 
tic with our pronunciation and is preferred by dr johnson 
for the same reason namely to avoid confusion in the pronuncia 
tion and also in order to keep in view the connexion with 
cathode the elements of an electrolyte which go to the anode and 
cathode respectively may be termed the anion and catfaon 
although the greek would suggest cation car iov 

 the example of chemistry has shown that we have in the 
terminations of words a resource of which great use may be made 
in indicating the relations of certain classes of objects as sul 
phurous and sulphur acids sulphates sulphites and sulphurets 
since the introduction of the artifice by the lavoisierian school it 
has been extended to some new cases thus chlorm fluorine 
bromine iodine had their names put into that shape in conse 
quence of their supposed analogy and for the same reason have 
been termed chlore phtore brome lode by french chemists 
in like manner the names of metals in their latin form have 
been made to end in um as osmium palladium and hence it is 
better to say platimm molybdenum than plating molybdena 
it has been proposed to term the basis of boracic acid boron 
and those who conceive that the basis of silica has an analogy 
with boron have proposed to term it silicon while those who 
look upon it as a metal would name it silicium selenium was 
so named when it was supposed to be a metal as its analogies 
are now acknowledged to be of another kind it would be desirable 
if the change were not too startling to term it selen as it is in 
german phosphow in like manner might be phosphor which 
would indicate its analogy with sulphur 

the resource which terminations offer has been applied in 
other cases the names of many species of minerals end in lite 



cxv aphorisms concerning 

or ite as staurote augite hence adolphe brongniart in order 
to form a name for a genus of fossil plants has given this termi 
nation to the name of the recent genus which they nearly resem 
ble as zaanites from zamia lycopodto from lycopodium 

names of different genera which differ in termination only 
are properly condemned by linnaeus as alsine alsinoides 
alsinella alsinastrum for there is no definite relation marked 
by those terminations linnaeus gives to such genera distinct 
names alsine bufonia sagina elatine 

terminations are well adapted to express definite systematic 
relations such as those of chemistry but they must be employed 
with a due regard to all the bearings of the system davy 
proposed to denote the combinations of other substances with 
chlorine by peculiar terminations using ane for the smallest 
proportion of chlorine and anea for the larger as cuprane 
cupranea in this nomenclature common salt would be sodane 
and chloride of nitrogen would be azotane this suggestion 
never found favour it was objected that it was contrary to the 
linnsean precept that a specific name must not be united to a 
generic as a termination but this was not putting the matter 
exactly on its right ground for the rules of nomenclature of 
natural history do not apply to chemistry and the linnsean rule 
might with equal propriety have been adduced as a condemnation 
of such terms as sulphurous sulphur but davys terms were 
bad for it does not appear that chlorine enters as oxygen does 
into so large a portion of chemical compounds that its relations 
afford a key to their nature and may properly be made an 
element in their names 

this resource of terminations has been abused wherever it 
has been used wantonly or without a definite significance in the 
variety this is the case in m beudanfs mineralogy among 
the names which he has given to new species we find the follow 
ing besides many in ite scolexero opsimose exanthelo 
c diacras panabas neopk neocl rhode stibi 
comx c marcel wilhelnuw sec exited and many 
others in addition to other objections which might be made 
 phil jot 



the language of science cxv 

to these names their variety is a material defect for to make 
this variety depend on caprice alone as in those cases it does is 
to throw away a resource of which chemical nomenclature may 
teach us the value 

aphorism xvii 

when alterations in technical terms become necessary it is desirable 
that the new term should contain in its form some memorial of 
the old one 

we have excellent examples of the advantageous use of this 
maxim in linnseuss reform of botanical nomenclature his 
innovations were very extensive but they were still moderated as 
much as possible and connected in many ways with the names 
of plants then in use he has himself given several rules of 
nomenclature which tend to establish this connexion of the 
old and new in a reform thus he says generic names 
which are current and are not accompanied with harm to botany 
should be tolerated a passable generic name is not to be 
changed for another though more apt new generic names 
are not to be framed so long as passable synonyms are at hand 
 a generic name of one genus except it be superfluous is not 
to be transferred to another genus though it suit the other 
better if a received genus requires to be divided into 
several the name which before included the whole shall be 
applied to the most common and familiar kind and though 
he rejects all generic names which have not a greek or latin 
rootu he is willing to make an exception in favour of those 
which from their form might be supposed to have such a root 
though they are really borrowed from other languages as thea y 
which is the greek for goddess coffea which might seem to come 
from a greek word denoting silence eo cheiranthus 
which appears to mean handflower but is really derived from 
the arabic keiri and many others 

as we have already said the attempt at a reformation of the 

 philosophia botanica art t p j p 

p j p t p 



cxviii aphorisms concerning 

nomenclature of mineralogy made by professor mohs will pro 
bably not produce any permanent effect on this account amongst 
others that it has not been conducted in this temperate mode 
the innovations bear too large a proportion to the whole of the 
names and contain too little to remind us of the known appella 
tions yet in some respects professor mohs has acted upon this 
maxim thus he has called one of his classes spar because 
felspar belongs to it i shall venture to offer a few suggestions 
on this subject of mineralogical nomenclature 

it has already been remarked that the confusion and complexity 
which prevail in this subject render a reform very desirable 
but it will be seen from the reasons assigned under the ninth 
aphorism that no permanent system of names can be looked for 
till a sound system of classification be established the best 
mineralogical systems recently published however appear to con 
verge to a common point and certain classes have been formed 
which have both a naturalhistorical and a chemical significance 
these classes according to naumann whose arrangement appears 
the best are hydrolytes haloids silicides oxides of metals 
metals sulphurides pyrites glances and blendes and anthra 
cides now we find that the hydrolytes are all compounds 
such as are commonly termed salts that the haloids are many 
of them already called spars as calc spar heavy spar iron 
spar zinc spar that the silicides the most numerous and 
difficult class are denoted for the most part by single words 
many of which end in ite that the other classes or subclasses 
oxides pyrites glances and blendes have commonly been so 
termed as red iron oxide iron pyrites zinc blende while 
pure metals have usually had the adjective native prefixed 
as native gold native copper these obvious features of 
the current names appear to afford us a basis for a systematic 
nomenclature the salts and spars might all have the word 
salt or spar included in their name as natron salt glauber 
salt hock salt calc spar bitter spar carbonate of lime 
and magnesia fluor spar phosphor spar phosphate of 
lime heavy spar celestine spar sulphate of strontian 
chromic lead spar chromate of lead the silicides might all 



the language of science 

have the name constructed so as to be a single word ending in ite 
as chabasite chabasie natr elite mesotype sommite nephe 
line pistacite epidote from this rule might be excepted the 
gems as topaz emerald corundum which might retain their 
old names the oxides pyrites glances and blendes might be 
so termed thus we should have tungstic iron oxide usually 
called tungstate of iron arsenical iron pyrites mispickel 
tetrahedral copper glance fahlerz quicksilver blende cinna 
bar and the metals might be termed native as native copper 
native silver 

such a nomenclature would take in a very large proportion of 
commonly received appellations especially if we were to select 
among the synonyms as is proposed above in the case of glauber 
salt bitter spar sommite pistacite natrolite hence it might 
be adopted without serious inconvenience it would make the 
name convey information respecting the place of the mineral in 
the system and by imposing this condition would limit the 
extreme caprice both as to origin and form which has hitherto 
been indulged in imposing mineralogical names 

the principle of a mineralogical nomenclature determined by 
the place of the species in the system has been recognized by mr 
beudant as well as mr mohs the former writer has proposed 
that we should say carbonate calcaire carbonate witherite sul 
phate couperose silicate stilbite silicate chabasie and so on 
but these are names in which the part added for the sake of the 
system is not incorporated with the common name and would 
hardly make its way into common use 

we have already noticed mr mohss designations for two of 
the systems of crystallization the pyramidal and the pris 
matic as not characteristic if it were thought advisable to re 
form such a defect this might be done by calling them the 
square pyramidal and the oblong prismatic which terms while 
they expressed the real distinction of the systems would be intel 
ligible at once to those acquainted with the mohsian terminology 

i will mention another suggestion respecting the introduction of 
an improvement in scientific language the term depolarization 
was introduced because it was believed that the effect of certain 



cxx aphorisms concerning the language of science 

crystals when polarized light was incident upon them in certain 
positions was to destroy the peculiarity which polarization had 
produced but it is now well known that the effect of the second 
crystal in general is to divide the polarized ray of light into two 
rays polarized in different planes still this effect is often spoken 
of as depolarization no better term having been yet devised i 
have proposed and used the term depolarization which well ex 
presses what takes place and so nearly resembles the older word 
that it must sound familiar to those already acquainted with 
writings on this subject 

i may mention one term in another department of literature 
which it appears desirable to reform in the same manner the 
theory of the fine arts or the philosophy which speculates con 
cerning what is beautiful in painting sculpture or architecture 
and other arts often requires to be spoken of in a single word 
baumgarten and other german writers have termed this province 
of speculation esthetics aicrddvecroai to perceive being a word 
which appeared to them fit to designate the perception of beauty 
in particular since however aesthetics would naturally denote 
the doctrine of perception since this doctrine requires a name 
since the term aesthetics has actually been applied to it by other 
german writers as kant and since the essential point in the 
philosophy now spoken of is that it attends to beauty it appears 
desirable to change this name in pursuance of the maxim now 
before us i should propose the term callwsthetics or rather in 
agreement with what was said in page cxiv callwsthetic the 
science of the perception of beauty 

i may here notice a principle which may sometimes be allowed 
to influence us in selecting one form rather than another for a 
technical term it is convenient to make correlative terms re 
semble each other in termination even when the resemblance is 
only apparent thus we may speak of marine and terrene animals 
rather than terrestrial or tellurian dr prichard speaks of car 
nivorous waphytiborous insects preferring the latter term to phy 
tophagous on account of its sound i suppose as well as for other 
reasons

introduction 

the philosophy of science if the phrase were to be 
understood in the comprehensive sense which most natu 
rally offers itself to our thoughts would imply nothing 
less than a complete insight into the essence and con 
ditions of all real knowledge and an exposition of the 
best methods for the discovery of new truths we must 
narrow and lower this conception in order to mould it 
into a form in which we may make it the immediate 
object of our labours with a good hope of success yet 
still it may be a rational and useful undertaking to 
endeavour to make some advance towards such a philo 
sophy even according to the most ample conception of it 
which we can form the present work has been written 
with a view of contributing in some measure however 
small it may be towards such an undertaking 

but in this as in every attempt to advance beyond 
the position which we at present occupy our hope of 
success must depend mainly upon our being able to profit 
to the fullest extent by the progress already made we 
may best hope to understand the nature and conditions 
of real knowledge by studying the nature and conditions 
of the most certain and stable portions of knowledge 
which we already possess and we are most likely to 
learn the best methods of discovering truth by examin 

b 



 of ideas in general 

ing how truths now universally recognised have really 
been discovered now there do exist among us doc 
trines of solid and acknowledged certainty and truths of 
which the discovery has been received with universal 
applause these constitute what we commonly term 
sciences and of these bodies of exact and enduring 
knowledge we have within our reach so large and varied 
a collection that we may examine them and the history 
of their formation with a good prospect of deriving from 
the study such instruction as we seek we may best 
hope to make some progress towards the philosophy of 
science by employing ourselves upon the philosophy 
of the sciences 

the sciences to which the name is most commonly 
and unhesitatingly given are those which are concerned 
about the material world whether they deal with the 
celestial bodies as the sun and stars or the earth and its 
products or the elements whether they consider the 
differences which prevail among such objects or their 
origin or their mutual operation and in all these 
sciences it is familiarly understood and assumed that 
their doctrines are obtained by a common process of col 
lecting general truths from particular observed facts 
which process is termed induction it is further assumed 
that both in these and in other provinces of knowledge 
so long as this process is duly and legitimately performed 
the results will be real substantial truth and although 
this process with the conditions under which it is 
legitimate and the general laws of the formation of 
sciences will hereafter be subjects of discussion in this 
work i shall at present so far adopt the assumption of 
which i speak as to give to the sciences from which our 
lessons are to be collected the name of inductive sciences 
and thus it is that i am led to designate my work as 
the philosophy of the inductive sciences 



introduction 

the views respecting the nature and progress of 
knowledge towards which we shall be directed by such a 
course of inquiry as i have pointed out though derived 
from those portions of human knowledge which are more 
peculiarly and technically termed sciences will by no 
means be confined in their bearing to the domain of such 
sciences as deal with the material world nor even to the 
whole range of sciences now existing on the contrary 
we shall be led to believe that the nature of truth is in all 
subjects the same and that its discovery involves in all 
cases the like conditions on one subject of human 
speculation after another mans knowledge assumes that 
exact and substantial character which leads us to term it 
science and in all these cases whether inert matter or 
living bodies whether permanent relations or successive 
occurrences be the subject of our attention we can point 
out certain universal characters which belong to truth 
certain general laws which have regulated its progress 
among men and we naturally expect that even when we 
extend our range of speculation wider still when we 
contemplate the world within us as well as the world 
without us when we consider the thoughts and actions of 
men as well as the motions and operations of unintelli 
gent bodies we shall still find some general analogies 
which belong to the essence of truth and run through 
the whole intellectual universe hence we have reason 
to trust that a just philosophy of the sciences may throw 
light upon the nature and extent of our knowledge in 
every department of human speculation by considering 
what is the real import of our acquisitions where they are 
certain and definite we may learn something respecting 
the difference between true knowledge and its precarious 
or illusory semblances by examining the steps by which 
such acquisitions have been made we may discover the 
conditions under which truth is to be obtained by 



 of ideas in general 

tracing the boundaryline between our knowledge and 
our ignorance we may ascertain in some measure the 
extent of the powers of mans understanding 

but it may be said in such a design there is nothing 
new these are objects at which inquiring men have often 
before aimed to determine the difference between real 
and imaginary knowledge the conditions under which w r e 
arrive at truth the range of the powers of the human 
mind has been a favourite employment of speculative 
men from the earliest to the most recent times to 
inquire into the original certainty and compass of mans 
knowledge the limits of his capacity the strength and 
weakness of his reason has been the professed purpose of 
many of the most conspicuous and valued labours of the 
philosophers of all periods up to our own day it may 
appear therefore that there is little necessity to add one 
more to these numerous essays and little hope that any 
new attempt will make any very important addition to 
the stores of thought upon such questions which have 
been accumulated by the profoundest and acutest thinkers 
of all ages 

to this i reply that without at all disparaging the 
value or importance of the labours of those who have 
previously written respecting the foundations and con 
ditions of human knowledge it may still be possible to 
add something to what they have clone the writings of 
all great philosophers up to our own time form a series 
which is not yet terminated the books and systems of 
philosophy which have each in its own time won the ad 
miration of men and exercised a powerful influence upon 
their thoughts have had each its own part and functions 
in the intellectual history of the world and other 
labours w r hich shall succeed these may also have their 
proper office and useful effect we may not be able to 
do much and yet still it may be in our power to effect 



introduction 

something perhaps the very advances made by former 
inquirers may have made it possible for us at present to 
advance still further in the discovery of truth in the 
developement of mans mental powers and privileges 
each generation has its assigned part and it is for us to 
endeavour to perform our portion of this perpetual task 
of our species although the terms which describe our 
undertaking may be the same which have often been em 
ployed by previous writers to express their purpose yet 
our position is different from theirs and thus the result 
may be different too we have as they had to run our 
appropriate course of speculation with the exertion of 
our best powers but our course lies in a more advanced 
part of the great line along wiiich philosophy travels 
from age to age however familiar and old therefore 
be the design of such a work as this the execution 
may have and if it be performed in a manner suitable 
to the time will have something that is new and not 
unimportant 

indeed it appears to be absolutely necessary in order 
to check the prevalence of grave and pernicious error 
that the doctrines which are taught concerning the foun 
dations of human knowledge and the powers of the 
human mind should be from time to time revised and 
corrected or extended erroneous and partial views are 
promulgated and accepted one portion of the truth is 
insisted upon to the undue exclusion of another or 
principles true in themselves are exaggerated till they 
produce on mens minds the effect of falsehood when 
evils of this kind have grown to a serious height a reform 
is requisite the faults of the existing systems must be 
remedied by correcting what is wrong and supplying 
what is wanting in such cases all the merits and ex 
cellencies of the labours of the preceding times do not 
supersede the necessity of putting forth new views suited 



 of ideas in general 

to the emergency which has arrived the new form 
which error has assumed makes it proper to endeavour to 
give a new and corresponding form to truth thus the 
mere progress of time and the natural growth of opinion 
from one stage to another leads to the production of 
new systems and forms of philosophy it will be found 
i think that some of the doctrines now most widely pre 
valent respecting the foundations and nature of truth are 
of such a kind that a reform is needed the present age 
seems by many indications to be called upon to seek a 
sounder philosophy of knowledge than is now current 
among us to contribute towards such a philosophy is 
the object of the present work the work is therefore 
like all works which take into account the most recent 
forms of speculative doctrine invested with a certain 
degree of novelty in its aspect and import by the mere 
time and circumstances of its appearance 

but moreover we can point out a very important 
peculiarity by which this work is in its design distin 
guished from preceding essays on like subjects and this 
difference appears to be of such a kind as may well en 
title us to expect some substantial addition to our know 
ledge as the result of our labours the peculiarity of 
which i speak has already been announced it is this 
that we purpose to collect our doctrines concerning the 
nature of knowledge and the best mode of acquiring it 
from a contemplation of the structure and history of 
those sciences the material sciences which are univer 
sally recognised as the clearest and surest examples of 
knowledge and of discovery it is by surveying and 
studying the whole mass of such sciences and the vari 
ous steps of their progress that we now hope to approach 
to the true philosophy of science 

now this i venture to say is a new method of pur 
suing the philosophy of human knowledge those who 



introduction 

have hitherto endeavoured to explain the nature of know 
ledge and the process of discovery have it is true often 
illustrated their views by adducing special examples of 
truths which they conceived to be established and by 
referring to the mode of their establishment but these 
examples have for the most part been taken at random 
not selected according to any principle or system often 
they have involved doctrines so precarious or so vague 
that they confused rather than elucidated the subject j 
and instead of a single difficulty what is the nature 
of knowledge these attempts at illustration introduced 
two what was the true analysis of the doctrines thus 
adduced and whether they might safely be taken as 
types of real knowledge 

this has usually been the case when there have been 
adduced as standard examples of the formation of human 
knowledge doctrines belonging to supposed sciences other 
than the material sciences doctrines for example 
of political economy or philology or morals or the phi 
losophy of the fine arts i am very far from thinking 
that in regard to such subjects there are no important 
truths hitherto established but it would seem that those 
truths which have been obtained in these provinces of 
knowledge have not yet been fixed by means of 
distinct and permanent phraseology and sanctioned 
by universal reception and formed into a connected 
system and traced through the steps of their gradual 
discovery and establishment so as to make them in 
structive examples of the nature and progress of truth 
in general hereafter we trust to be able to show that 
the progress of moral and political and philological and 
other knowledge is governed by the same laws as that 
of physical science but since at present the former 
class of subjects are full of controversy doubt and 
obscurity while the latter consist of undisputed truths 



 of ideas in general 

clearly understood and expressed it may be considered 
a wise procedure to make the latter class of doctrines 
the basis of our speculations and on the having taken 
this course is in a great measure my hope founded of 
obtaining valuable truths which have escaped preceding 
inquirers 

but it may be said that many preceding writers on 
the nature and progress of knowledge have taken their 
examples abundantly from the physical sciences it 
would be easy to point out admirable works which have 
appeared during the present and former generations in 
which instances of discovery borrowed from the physical 
sciences are introduced in a manner most happily 
instructive and to the works in which this has been 
done i gladly give my most cordial admiration but at 
the same time i may venture to remark that there still 
remains a difference between my design and theirs and 
that i use the physical sciences as exemplifications of the 
general progress of knowledge in a manner very mate 
rially different from the course which is followed in works 
such as are now referred to for the conclusions stated 
in the present work respecting knowledge and discovery 
are drawn from a connected and systematic survey of the 
whole range of physical science and its history whereas 
hitherto philosophers have contented themselves with 
adducing detached examples of scientific doctrines drawn 
from one or two departments of science so long as we 
select our examples in this arbitrary and limited manner 
we lose the best part of that philosophical instruction 
which the sciences are fitted to afford when we consider 
them as all members of one series and as governed by rules 
which are the same for all mathematical and chemical 
truths physical and physiological doctrines the sciences of 
classification and of causation must alike be taken into 
our account in order that we may learn what are the 



introduction 

general characters of real knowledge when our con 
clusions assume so comprehensive a shape that they apply 
to a range of subjects so vast and varied as these we 
may feel some confidence that they represent the genuine 
form of universal and permanent truth but if our 
exemplification is of a narrower kind it may easily 
cramp and disturb our philosophy we may for instance 
render our views of truth and its evidence so rigid and 
confined as to be quite worthless by founding them too 
much on the contemplation of mathematical truth we 
may overlook some of the most important steps in the 
general course of discovery by fixing our attention too 
exclusively upon some one conspicuous group of dis 
coveries as for instance those of newton we may 
misunderstand the nature of physiological discoveries by 
attempting to force an analogy between them and dis 
coveries of mechanical laws without attending to the 
intermediate sciences which fill up the vast interval 
between these extreme terms in the series of material 
sciences in these and in many other ways a partial 
and arbitrary reference to the material sciences in our 
inquiry into human knowledge may mislead us or at 
least may fail to give us those wider views and that 
deeper insight which should result from a systematic study 
of the whole range of sciences with this particular object 

the design of the following work then is to form a 
philosophy of science by analysing the substance and 
examining the progress of the existing body of the 
sciences as a preliminary to this undertaking a survey 
of the history of the sciences was necessary this 
accordingly i have already performed and the result of 
the labour thus undertaken has been laid before the 
public as a history of the inductive sciences 

in that work i have endeavoured to trace the steps 
by which men acquired each main portion of that know 



 of ideas in general 

ledge on which they now look with so much confidence 
and satisfaction the events which that history relates the 
speculations and controversies which are there described 
and discussions of the same kind far more extensive 
which are there omitted must all be taken into our 
account at present as the prominent and standard 
examples of the circumstances which attend the progress 
of knowledge with so much of real historical fact 
before us we may hope to avoid such views of the pro 
cesses of the human mind as are too partial and limited 
or too vague and loose or too abstract and unsubstantial 
to represent fitly the real forms of discovery and of truth 
of former attempts made with the same view of 
tracing the conditions of the progress of knowledge that 
of bacon is perhaps the most conspicuous and his 
labours on this subject were opened by his book on the 
advancement of learning which contains among other 
matter a survey of the then existing state of knowledge 
but this review was undertaken rather with the object of 
ascertaining in what quarters future advances were to be 
hoped for than of learning by what means they were to be 
made his examination of the domain of human know 
ledge was conducted rather with the view of discovering 
what remained undone than of finding out how so much 
had been done bacons survey was made for the purpose 
of tracing the boundaries rather than of detecting the 
principles of knowledge i will now attempt he says 
 to make a general and faithful perambulation of learn 
ing with an inquiry what parts thereof lie fresh and 
waste and not improved and converted by the industry of 
man to the end that such a plot made and recorded to 
memory may both minister light to any public designa 
tion and also serve to excite voluntary endeavours 
nor will it be foreign to our scheme also hereafter to 
 achoncement of learning b i p 



introduction 

examine with a like purpose the frontier of mans intel 
lectual estate but the object of our perambulation in 
the first place is not so much to determine the extent of 
the field as the sources of its fertility we would learn 
by what plan and rules of culture conspiring with the 
native forces of the bounteous soil those rich harvests 
have been produced which fill our garners bacons 
maxims on the other hand respecting the mode in which 
he conceived that knowledge was thenceforth to be cul 
tivated have little reference to the failures still less to 
the successes which are recorded in his review of the 
learning of his time his precepts are connected with 
his historical views in a slight and unessential manner 
his philosophy of the sciences is not collected from the 
sciences which are noticed in his survey nor in truth 
could this at the time when he wrote have easily been 
otherwise at that period scarce any branch of physics 
existed as a science except astronomy the rules which 
bacon gives for the conduct of scientific researches are 
obtained as it were by divination from the contempla 
tion of subjects with regard to which no sciences as yet 
were his instances of steps rightly or wrongly made in 
this path are in a great measure cases of his own devis 
ing he could not have exemplified his aphorisms by 
references to treatises then extant on the laws of nature 
for the constant burden of his exhortation is that men 
up to his time had almost universally followed an erro 
neous course and however we may admire the sagacity 
with which he pointed the way along a better path we 
have this great advantage over him that we can interro 
gate the many travellers who since his time have journeyed 
on this road at the present day when we have under 
our notice so many sciences of such wide extent so well 
established a philosophy of the sciences ought it must 
seem to be founded not upon conjecture but upon an 



 of ideas in general 

examination of many instances should not consist of a 
few vague and unconnected maxims difficult and doubt 
ful in their application but should form a system of which 
every part has been repeatedly confirmed and verified 

this accordingly it is the purpose of the present work 
to attempt but i may further observe that as my hope 
of making any progress in this undertaking is founded 
upon the design of keeping constantly in view the whole 
result of the past history and present condition of science 
i have also been led to draw my lessons from my exam 
ples in a manner more systematic and regular as appears 
to me than has been done by preceding writers bacon 
as i have just said was led to his maxims for the promo 
tion of knowledge by the sagacity of his own mind with 
little or no aid from previous examples succeeding 
philosophers may often have gathered useful instruction 
from the instances of scientific truths and discoveries 
which they adduced but their conclusions were drawn 
from their instances casually and arbitrarily they took 
for their moral any which the story might suggest bat 
such a proceeding as this cannot suffice for us whose aim 
is to obtain a consistent body of philosophy from a con 
templation of the whole of science and its history for 
our purpose it is necessary to resolve scientific truths into 
their conditions and ingredients in order that we may see 
in what manner each of these has been and is to be 
provided in the cases which we may have to consider 
this accordingly is necessarily the first part of our task 
to analyse scientific truth into its elements this attempt 
will occupy the earlier portion of the present work and 
will necessarily be somewhat long and perhaps in many 
parts abstruse and uninviting the risk of such an 
inconvenience is inevitable for the inquiry brings before 
us many of the most dark and entangled questions in 
which men have at any time busied themselves and 



introduction 

even if these can now be made clearer and plainer than 
of yore still they can be made so only by means of men 
tal discipline and mental effort moreover this analysis 
of scientific truth into its elements contains much both in 
its principles and in its results different from the doctrines 
most generally prevalent among us in recent times but 
on that very account this analysis is an essential part 
of the doctrines which i have now to lay before the 
reader and i must therefore crave his indulgence towards 
any portion of it which may appear to him obscure or 
repulsive 

there is another circumstance which may tend to 
make the present work less pleasing than others on the 
same subject in the nature of the examples of human 
knowledge to which i confine myself all my instances 
being as i have said taken from the material sciences 
for the truths belonging to these sciences are for the 
most part neither so familiar nor so interesting to the 
bulk of readers as those doctrines which belong to some 
other subjects every general proposition concerning 
politics or morals at once stirs up an interest in mens 
bosoms which makes them listen with curiosity to the 
attempts to trace it to its origin and foundation every 
rule of art or language brings before the mind of culti 
vated men subjects of familiar and agreeable thought 
and is dwelt upon with pleasure for its own sake as well 
as on account of the philosophical lessons which it may 
convey but the curiosity which regards the truths of 
physics or chemistry or even of physiology and astro 
nomy is of a more limited and less animated kind 
hence in the mode of inquiry which i have prescribed 
to myself the examples which i have to adduce will not 
amuse and relieve the readers mind as much as they 
might do if i could allow myself to collect them from 
the whole field of human knowledge they will have in 



 of ideas in general 

them nothing to engage his fancy or to warm his heart 
i am compelled to detain the listener in the chilly air 
of the external world in order that we may have the 
advantage of full daylight 

but although i cannot avoid this inconvenience so far 
as it is one i hope it will be recollected how great are the 
advantages which we obtain by this restriction we are 
thus enabled to draw all our conclusions from doctrines 
which are universally allowed to be eminently certain 
clear and definite the portions of knowledge to which 
i refer are well known and well established among men 
their names are familiar their assertions uncontested 
astronomy and geology mechanics and chemistry optics 
and acoustics botany and physiology are each recognised 
as large and substantial collections of undoubted truths 
men are wont to dwell with pride and triumph on the 
acquisitions of knowledge which have been made in each 
of these provinces and to speak with confidence of the 
certainty of their results and all can easily learn in 
what repositories these treasures of human knowledge are 
to be found when therefore we begin our inquiry 
from such examples we proceed upon a solid foundation 
with such a clear ground of confidence we shall not be 
met with general assertions of the vagueness and un 
certainty of human knowledge with the question what 
truth is and how we are to recognise it with complaints 
concerning the hopelessness and unprofitableness of such 
researches we have at least a definite problem before 
us we have to examine the structure and scheme not 
of a shapeless mass of incoherent materials of which we 
doubt whether it be a ruin or a natural wilderness but of 
a fair and lofty palace still erect and tenanted where 
hundreds of different apartments belong to a common 
plan where every generation adds something to the 
extent and magnificence of the pile the certainty and 



introduction 

the constant progress of science are things so unques 
tioned that we are at least engaged in an intelligible 
inquiry when we are examining the grounds and nature 
of that certainty the causes and laws of that progress 

to this inquiry then we now proceed and in 
entering upon this task however our plan or our prin 
ciples may differ from those of the eminent philosophers 
who have endeavoured in our own or in former times to 
illustrate or enforce the philosophy of science we most 
willingly acknowledge them as in many things our 
leaders and teachers each reform must involve its own 
peculiar principles and the result of our attempts so far 
as they lead to a result must be in some respects 
different from those of former works but we may still 
share with the great writers who have treated this 
subject before us their spirit of hope and trust their 
reverence for the dignity of the subject their belief in 
the vast powers and boundless destiny of man and we 
may once more venture to use the words of hopeful 
exhortation with which the greatest of those who have 
trodden this path encouraged himself arid his followers 
when he set out upon his way 

 concerning ourselves we speak not but as touching 
the matter which we have in hand this we ask that 
men deem it not to be the setting up an opinion but the 
performing of a work and that they receive this as a 
certainty that we are not laying the foundations of any 
sect or doctrine but of the profit and dignity of mankind 
furthermore that being well disposed to what shall 
advantage themselves and putting off factions and pre 
judices they take common counsel with us to the end 
that being by these our aids and appliances freed and 
defended from wanderings and impediments they may 
lend their hands also to the labours which remain to be 
performed and yet further that they be of good hope 
vol i c 



 of ideas in general 

neither imagine to themselves this our reform as some 
thing of infinite dimension and beyond the grasp of 
mortal man when in truth it is the end and true limit of 
infinite errour and is by no means unmindful of the 
condition of mortality and humanity not confiding that 
such a thing can be carried to its perfect close in the 
space of one single age but assigning it as a task to a 
succession of generations 



chapter ii 
of facts and theories 

 i regret very much that i must begin my discus 
sion by questioning the validity of a distinction which is 
usually considered to be clear and plain for my pur 
pose is to establish distinctions not to obliterate them 
and with regard to such contrasts as are commonly 
recognised among men it will generally be my business 
rather to point out their real import and give them as 
much clefiniteness as possible than to endeavour to 
involve them in doubt and confusion and indeed 
though i am compelled at first to expose the obscurity 
of the supposed line which separates fact and theory i 
shall afterwards have to show that the contrast which we 
mark by these terms does really involve an antithesis 
which is the foundation of the whole philosophy of know 
ledge 

every one is familiar with the distinction of fact and 
theory as commonly understood facts offer themselves 
to our senses on every side ingenious men have framed 
theories that is modes of mental conception by which 
the facts are interpreted connected and accounted for 
every moment offers us examples of the two the day 



of facts and theories 

dawns the suns bright edge beams over the distant 
hills that is the fact the theory is that the earths 
surface rolls round towards the sun and thus brings him 
into view the dewdrops hang on the blade and the 
leaf their globular form is a fact by our theory we 
see in this fact a mutual attraction of the minutest por 
tion of the water which composes the drops each drop 
as it hangs in the sunshine has on its surface a bright 
spot which shifts as the beholder moves and has behind 
it another bright speck which falls on some neighbouring 
object these facts our theories make us contemplate 
as the reflected and refracted light of the sun the 
plant thus hung with dew exhibits to us its leaves and 
flowers but in our minds we compare it with other plants 
in which the leaves and flowers are more or less different 
we consider these facts as indicating the relation of this 
particular plant to some wider family of the vegetable 
system such as in our theory we have arranged it or 
if we are acquainted with the plants of other regions we 
may see in the existence and features of such a plant the 
confirmation of a theory by which we look upon some 
portion of our vegetable population as strangers wandered 
hither from a distant land 

 in all these cases the distinction between the fact 
as it presents itself to our senses and the theoretical 
view seems at first sight plain enough yet a little con 
sideration may show us that this distinction is not in 
every case quite clear is it not a fact as well as a 
theory that we see the light reflected from the surface of 
a dewdrop and do we not by our common language 
acknowledge it to be so and is not the refraction of 
the light through the water as much a fact as its reflection 
from the surface does not the manner in which the 
drop hangs from the leaf show that it is a fact that the 
particles of water adhere to or attract each other is not 

c 



 of ideas in general 

tins as much a fact as the globular form of the drops or 
indeed more so for the drops are riot strictly globular 
that they are not so we learn from theory and thus 
our theory corrects our facts is not the greater or less 
resemblance of one plant to another a fact and is not 
therefore a classification which is merely a collection of 
such resemblances a fact also and if the doctrine of 
the derivation of any particular plant from one region to 
another be a true theory is it not a fact on that very 
account 

and with regard to the first mentioned of the above 
cases the theoretical motion of the earth is not that also 
a fact if the theory be true it may be said that the 
theory contradicts the facts as noticed by our senses 
but that our senses may misinform us respecting facts 
we easily see when we glide along smooth water in 
a barge our senses inform us that the shore moves away 
from us but we know the fact to be otherwise and if 
the motion of the barge be the fact in this case is not 
the motion of the earth by which the suns rising is pro 
duced a fact no less 

again if it were said that that is a fact which our 
senses perceive the question must be asked whose senses 
one man watches the stars all the night and sees them 
describe circles about the pole another looks at them 
carelessly and at intervals and sees no circles is not 
the diurnal circular motion of the stars a fact again 
a man may rightly apprehend the motion of the stars for 
one night but may not notice the motion of the moon 
among the stars from night to night another man 
notices this latter motion also to him the moons 
monthly circuit through the heavens is a fact and 
again to another observer more vigilant the annual 
motion of the sun in the ecliptic is a fact just as much 
as the monthly motion of the moon in her orbit for 



of facts and theories 

the only difference is that the moons light quenches 
only the smaller stars in her neighbourhood while the 
sun obliterates all and thus what is matter of theory 
to one observer is matter of fact to another 

is it not indeed evident that a theory if it be true 
is on that very account a fact all the great theories 
which have successively been established in the world 
are now thought of as facts is not the motion of the 
earth round the sun a fact is not the elliptical form 
of the planets orbits a fact is not the attraction of the 
sun upon the planets a fact is not the circulation of 
the blood a fact the definite and multiple proportions 
of the elements of bodies which make up what is com 
monly called the atomic theory are not they facts 

thus the opposition of fact and theory a contrast 
which at first appeared so broad and plain as we examine 
it becomes wavering obscure and doubtful the line of 
demarcation is invisible the application of the distinc 
tion full of difficulty that which is a fact under one 
aspect is a theory under another the most recondite 
theories when firmly established are accepted as facts 
the simplest facts appear to involve something of the 
nature of theory 

 but yet in what has been said something of a 
difference between fact and theory still remains apparent 
it is only when theories are firmly established and recog 
nised as indisputably true that they become facts the 
view originally theoretical becomes at length so con 
vincing that it occurs to us as the most natural view and 
then it is theoretical no longer the interpretation of 
appearances which was at first a novelty and an effort 
becomes at last so familiar that we are not conscious of 
it and then the distinction of theory and fact in that 
instance melts away theory is some interpretation 
of phenomena or inference from them which we make 



 of ideas in general 

by a conscious act of thought adding some new form of 
conception to that which at first offers itself and as 
the doubt and the effort and the consciousness of the 
mental act gradually depart the theory is a theory no 
longer but becomes a fact 

and thus as we become more and more familiar with 
sound theoretical views such views become to us as 
really facts as those which are most obvious to the senses 
the astronomer constantly observing the moon and de 
termining from her apparent her real motions sees 
that she is drawn by the earth as clearly as a common 
spectator sees the needle drawn by the magnet that 
which is intellectual effort to others is unconscious habit 
in him he sees the true motion in the apparent and 
separates the compound course into the simple paths with 
no more doubt than the voyager feels when in judging of 
the course of a distant ship he allows for the motion of 
his own vessel and for his own movements as he walks 
the deck and as this true motion of the paths of the 
earth and moon which is to him an habitual and ine 
vitable interpretation of their visible changes is thus a 
fact the mutual attraction of the two bodies which is 
but a further interpretation equally inevitable of those 
motions is also a fact to him while to those less accus 
tomed to such interpretations and who therefore cannot 
apply them without a conscious act of thought such a 
view of the case even when accepted as true is more 
properly described as theory 

 in this instance the doctrine of which i have 
spoken the attraction which the earth exerts upon the 
moon would be termed a theory by most persons because 
those to whom this is a familiar and simple inference from 
the phenomena are only a few accomplished astronomers 
but in other similar cases many or most persons per 
form a similar act of interpretation without being con 



of facts and theories 

scions of it when we assert that the magnet draws the 
needle we see only the motion of the needle which oc 
curs when the magnet is brought into its neighbourhood 
it is by an act of our own minds that we ascribe this 
motion to a force that in this case a force is exerted 
upon the needle such as we could by our volition exert 
is our unconscious interpretation of the phenomena and 
is hence received by us as a fact 

 but it is not in such cases only that we interpret 
phenomena in our own way without being conscious of 
what we do we see a tree at a distance and judge it 
to be a chestnut or a lime yet this is only an inference 
from the colour or form of the mass according to precon 
ceived classifications of our own our lives are full of 
such unconscious interpretations the farmer recognises 
a good or bad soil the artist a picture of a favourite 
master the geologist a rock of a known locality as we 
recognise the faces and voices of our friends that is by 
judgments formed on what we see and hear but judg 
ments in which we do not analyse the steps or distinguish 
the inference from the appearance and in these mix 
tures of observation and inference we speak of the 
judgment thus formed as a fact directly observed 

even in the case in which our perceptions appear to 
be most direct and least to involve any interpretations of 
our own in the simple process of seeing who does 
not know how much we by an act of the mind add to 
that which our senses receive does any one fancy that 
he sees a solid cube it is easy to show that the solidity 
of the figure the relative position of its faces and edges 
to each other are inferences of the spectator no more 
conveyed to his conviction by the eye alone than they 
would be if he were looking at a painted representation of 
a cube the scene of nature is a picture without depth 
of substance no less than the scene of art and in the 



 of ideas in general 

one case as in the other it is the mind which by an act 
of its own discovers that colour and shape denote dis 
tance and solidity most men are unconscious of this 
perpetual habit of reading the language of the external 
world and translating as they read the draughtsman 
indeed is compelled for his purposes to return back in 
thought from the solid bodies which he has inferred to 
the shapes of surface which he really sees he knows 
that there is a mask of theory over the whole face of 
nature if it be theory to infer more than we see but 
other men unaware of this masquerade hold it to be a 
fact that they see cubes and spheres spacious apartments 
and winding avenues and these things are facts to 
them because they are unconscious of the mental opera 
tion by which they have penetrated natures disguise 

and thus we still have an intelligible distinction of 
fact and theory if we consider theory as a conscious and 
fact as an unconscious inference from the phenomena 
which are presented to our senses 

 yet still the distinction thus stated is far from 
being rigorous and permanent as in truth we have already 
seen that in practice it is very precarious and obscure 
the difference of conscious and unconscious acts is by no 
means strongly marked education habit the degree of 
selfobservation the circumstances of the case all serve 
to make the person unconscious or conscious of mental 
acts in innumerable degrees the draughtsman sees in 
nature features and outlines which others do not see 
the practised astrologer sees the moon walk from house 
to house in her path as he sees his friend walk from house 
to house in the street the beginner in the study sees this 
with conscious effort but one of these habits gradually 
passes into the other the distinction of conscious and 
unconscious acts of thought fades away as we examine it 
we may walk or talk as well as see without conscious 



of facts and theories 

effort yet walking and talking imply acts of thought as 
we perceive when we walk on a rugged path or talk in 
a foreign language hence if this greater or less consci 
ousness of our own internal act be all that distinguishes 
fact from theory we must allow that the distinction is still 
untenable the boundaryline again melts away the 
difference is unsubstantial the opposition loses its signi 
ficance as we examine it 

still there appears to be something real in this anti 
thesis and we must return to the examination of it under 
another form 



chapter iii 
of sensations and ideas 

 it has appeared that facts as well as theories in 
volve some act of the mind but it is also clear that they 
must involve something else besides an act of the mind 
if we must exercise an act of thought in order to see force 
exerted or orbits described by bodies in motion or even 
in order to see bodies in space and to distinguish one 
kind of object from another still the act of thought alone 
does not make these objects there must be something 
besides on which the thought is exerted a colour a 
form a sound are not produced by the mind however 
they may be moulded combined and interpreted by our 
mental acts a philosophical poet has spoken of 

all the world 

of eye and ear both what they half create 
and what perceive 

but it is clear that though they half create they do not 
wholly create there must be an external world of colour 
and sound to give impressions to the eye and ear as 
well as internal powers by which we perceive what is 



 of ideas in general 

offered to those organs the mind is in some way passive 
as well as active there are sensations as well as acts of 
thought objects without as well as faculties within 

 indeed this is so far generally acknowledged that 
according to common apprehension the mind is passive 
rather than active in acquiring the knowledge which it 
receives concerning the material world its sensations are 
generally considered as more evident than its operations 
the world without is held to be more clearly real than 
the faculties within that there is something different 
from ourselves something external to us something in 
dependent of us something which no act of our minds 
can make or can destroy is held by all men to be at 
least as evident as that our minds exert any effectual pro 
cess in modifying and appropriating the impressions made 
upon them most persons are more likely to doubt 
whether the mind be always active in contemplating 
external objects than whether it be always passive in 
perceiving them 

this question however we have already in some mea 
sure answered for we have shown that in many in 
stances where we are at the time unconscious of what we 
do we are combining interpreting reasoning from the 
appearances which we have before our eyes and that 
without this operation we cannot know anything nor even 
recognise any single body as existing in the space about us 
this view of the process of perception will be further pro 
secuted hereafter but in the mean time we have it may 
be hoped made it appear that in his apprehension of the 
objects which nature presents to him man is both active 
and passive that he has both ideas and sensations 

 i use the term idea here to designate those 
inevitable general relations which are imposed upon our 
perceptions by acts of the mind and which are different 
from anything which our senses directly offer to us thus 



of sensations and ideas 

we see various shades and colours and shapes before us 
but the outlines by which they are separated into distinct 
objects the conception by which they are considered as solid 
bodies at various distances from us these elements are not 
ministered by the senses but supplied by the mind itself 
and in drawing the outlines of bodies in placing them at 
different distances from us the mind proceeds in accord 
ance with certain necessary general relations which are 
involved in the idea of space in like manner when seeing 
the motions of a needle towards a magnet we conceive an 
attractive force exerted and obeyed we form this concep 
tion by referring these motions to the idea of cause 

our sensations are constantly apprehended in subor 
dination to such ideas as these and ideas of this wide 
and comprehensive nature such as space and time num 
ber and figure cause and resemblance which are the 
source of an innumerable series of more limited concep 
tions i term fundamental ideas and i shall hereafter 
endeavour to enumerate and analyse some of the most 
important of them 

 i am thus using the term idea in a very wide sense 
but yet this use of it is far more limited than that which 
occurs in common language for i restrict its applica 
tion to the relations and conditions which are imposed on 
our sensations through the activity of the mind and 
thus i do not apply the term to any impressions made 
upon the mind in virtue of its passive nature merely 
whereas the term idea has often been used for almost all 
imaginable results of our passive and active powers com 
bined if we speak of an idea of any existing object as 
for example of st pauls cathedral we denote by this 
use of the term a combination of various recollected im 
pressions of form and colour as well as order and sym 
metry and we thus include in the word a mixture of 
sensations as well as ideas in the more exact sense which 



 of ideas in general 

i would assign to the term but the word thus applied 
appears to answer no purpose of analysis or at least not 
the purpose which we have here in view the distinction 
of sensations which the mind passively receives and ideas 
which it actively employs is of the highest importance in 
order to the prosecution of our investigations and in 
order that we may keep this difference steadily before us 
i shall trust to be allowed the liberty of assigning to these 
terms in these pages this definite and constant sense 
i must now further consider the distinction and indepen 
dence of these two elements 



chapter iv 

of the difference and opposition of 
sensations and ideas 

 ideas and sensations are distinct thus ideas are 
the active sensations the passive element of our minds 
but it may be urged that it is impossible to make such a 
separation of our consciousness there are as we have 
already said few cases if any in which the mind is 
entirely passive some act of the mind accompanies the 
reception of our most tranquil perceptions and on the 
other hand it is clear that no act of the mind can be con 
ceived without some impression previously made on the 
senses without the use of sight and touch where 
would be our idea of space or number or resemblance 
or cause and thus it may be said ideas in our sense 
of the term without sensations and sensations without 
ideas are altogether idle and imaginary hypotheses 
they can nowhere be found in reality and a distinction 
where separation is impossible can be of no use or value 

to this we reply that although it is impossible com 
pletely to separate in any actual cases sensations and 



opposition op sensations and ideas 

ideas nevertheless tlie distinction is real and the oppo 
sition of the two is a principle of the most essential im 
portance in all philosophy and this principle we must 
endeavour to illustrate further 

the distinction has constantly exercised a very im 
portant influence on the speculations respecting the nature 
of knowledge in which men have employed themselves in 
all ages and in the course of these speculations it has 
been illustrated by means of various images one of the 
most ancient of these and one still very instructive is 
that which speaks of the sensations as the matter and 
the ideas as the form of our knowledge just as ivory 
is the matter and a cube the form of a die and this 
comparison may at least show us how little force there is 
in the objection just stated that sensations and ideas are 
not separable in fact and therefore that their separation 
in our reasonings can be of no service for the same is 
the case with respect to matter and form these two 
things cannot by any means be detached from each 
other the ivory must have some form if not a cube 
a sphere or some other the cube in order to be a cube 
must be of some material or other a figure without 
matter is merely a geometrical conception an idea 
matter without figure is a mere abstract term a sup 
posed union of sensible qualities which so insulated from 
others cannot exist yet the distinction of matter and 
form is real for it is clear and plain as a subject of con 
templation and it is by no means useless for the 
speculations which treat of materials are very widely 
separated from those which treat of figure on each 
subject there may be much to be said and the two 
subjects would be through their whole extent distinct 
the researches concerning the two may involve principles 
as different for example as the principles of chemistry and 
geometry if therefore we were to refuse to consider the 



 of ideas in general 

matter and the form of bodies separately because we 
cannot exhibit matter and form separately we should 
shut the door to all philosophy on such subjects and 
the same is the case with the analogous instance of sensa 
tions and ideas 

 ideas are not transformed sensations in a certain 
school of speculators there has existed a disposition to 
derive all our ideas from our sensations the term idea 
having been used in its wider sense so as to include all 
modifications and limitations of our fundamental ideas 
the doctrines of this school have been summarily 
expressed by saying that every idea is a transformed 
sensation now even supposing this assertion to be 
exactly true we easily see from what has been said how 
little we are likely to answer the ends of philosophy by 
putting forward such a maxim as one of primary import 
ance for we might say in like manner that every 
statue is but a transformed block of marble or every 
edifice but a collection of transformed stones but 
what would these assertions avail us if our object were to 
trace the rules of art by which beautiful statues were 
formed or great works of architecture erected the 
question naturally occurs what is the nature the prin 
ciple the law of this transformation in what faculty 
resides the transforming power what train of ideas 
of beauty and symmetry and stability in the mind of 
the statuary or the architect has produced those great 
works which mankind look upon as among their most 
valuable possessions the apollo of the belvedere the 
parthenon the cathedral of cologne when this is what 
we want to know how are we helped by learning that the 
apollo is of parian marble or the cathedral of basaltic 
stone we must know much more than this in order 
to acquire any insight into the principles of statuary or of 
architecture in like manner in order that we may 



opposition of sensations and ideas 

make any progress in the philosophy of knowledge which 
is our purpose we must endeavour to learn something 
further respecting ideas than that they are transformed 
sensations even if they were this 

but in reality the assertion that our ideas are trans 
formed sensations is erroneous as well as frivolous for 
it conveys and is intended to convey the opinion that 
our sensations have one form which properly belongs to 
them and that in order to become ideas they are con 
verted into some other form but the truth is that our 
sensations of themselves without some act of the mind 
such as involves what we have termed an idea have no 
form we cannot see one object without the idea of 
space we cannot see two without the idea of resem 
blance or difference and space and difference are not 
sensations thus if we are to employ the metaphor of mat 
ter and form which is implied in the expression to which 
i have referred our sensations from their first reception 
have their form not changed but given by our ideas 
without the relations of thought which we here term 
ideas the sensations are matter without form matter 
without form cannot exist and in like manner sensations 
cannot become perceptions of objects without some forma 
tive power of the mind by the very act of being received 
as perceptions they have a formative power exercised 
upon them the operation of which might be expressed 
by speaking of them not as transformed but simply as 
formed as invested with form instead of being the 
mere formless material of perception the word inform 
according to its latin etymology at first implied this 
process by which matter is invested with form thus 
virgil speaks of the thunderbolt as informed by the 

 ferrum exercebant vasto cyclopes in antro 

brontesque steropesque et nudus membra pyracmon 
his informattim manibus jam parte polita 
fulmen erat viii 



 of ideas in general 

hands of brontes and steropes and pyracmon and 
dryden introduces the word in another place 

let others better mould the running mass 
of metals or inform the breathing brass 

even in this use of the word the form is something 
superior to the brute matter and gives it a new signi 
ficance and purpose and hence the term is again used 
to denote the effect produced by an intelligent principle 
of a still higher kind 

he informed 

this illshaped body with a daring soul 

and finally even the soul itself in its original condition 
is looked upon as matter when viewed with reference to 
education and knowledge by which it is afterwards 
moulded and hence these are in our language termed 
information if we confine ourselves to the first of these 
three uses of the term we may correct the erroneous 
opinion of which we have just been speaking and retain 
the metaphor by which it is expressed by saying that 
ideas are not transformed but informed sensations 

 subjective and objective there is another mode of 
expressing the distinction of our sensations and our 
ideas which has been often used by writers on such 
topics although in our own country of late years it has 
not been familiar to general readers according to the 
technical language of ancient philosophy any ones quali 
ties and acts are attributes of which he is the subject 
and thus the mind is the subject to which its own ideas 
and operations appertain but these ideas are employed 
upon external objects and from external objects all his 
sensations proceed hence that part of mans mental 
occupation which springs from the faculties and operations 
of his own mind is subjective while that which flows in 
upon him from the world external to him is objective 
and as in his contemplation of nature there is always 



opposition of sensations and ideas 

some act of thought which depends ou himself and 
some matter of thought which is independent of him 
there is in every part of his knowledge a subjective and 
an objective element 

this phraseology is very familiar in the philosophical 
writers of germany and france and is not uncommon in 
every age of our own literature but whether or no we 
think fit to adopt these terms the opposition which they 
imply is one of essential and fundamental importance in 
all our speculations concerning the nature of knowledge 
we may express the opposition in what terms we please 
we may speak for instance of internal and external 
sources of our knowledge of the world within and the 
world without us of man and nature of ideas and ex 
perience and of many other antitheses but in what 
ever way we denote the contrast of the subjective and 
objective part of our speculations the distinction is real 
and solid and we shall hereafter see how essential the 
principle of this contrast is in order to express the laws 
of the successful prosecution of knowledge 

the combination of the two of ideas and experience 
is as we shall see necessary in order to give us any 
knowledge of the external world any insight into the 
laws of nature different persons according to their 
mental habits and constitution may be inclined to dwell 
by preference upon one or the other of these two ele 
ments but no knowledge can exist without the prac 
tical union of the two nor any philosophy without their 
speculative separation it may perhaps interest the 
reader to see this combination and this opposition illus 
trated in the intercourse of two eminent men of genius 
of modern times gbthe and schiller 

gbthe himself gives us the account to which i refer 
in his history of the progress of his speculations concern 
ing the metamorphosis of plants a mode of viewing their 
vol i d 



 of ideas in general 

structure by which he explained in a very striking and 
beautiful manner the relations of the different parts of a 
plant to each other as has been narrated in the history 
of the inductive sciences gbthe felt a delight in the 
passive contemplation of nature unmingled with the 
desire of reasoning and theorizing a delight such as 
naturally belongs to those poets who merely embody the 
images which a fertile genius suggests and do not mix 
with these pictures judgments and reflections of their 
own schiller on the other hand both by his own strong 
feeling of the value of a moral purpose in poetry and by 
his adoption of a system of metaphysics in which the sub 
jective element was made very prominent was well dis 
posed to recognize fully the authority of ideas over 
external impressions 

gbthe for a time felt a degree of estrangement to 
wards schiller arising from this contrariety in their views 
and characters but on one occasion they fell into dis 
cussion on the study of natural history and gbthe 
endeavoured to impress upon his companion his persua 
sion that nature was to be considered not as composed 
of detached and incoherent parts but as active and alive 
and unfolding herself in each portion in virtue of prin 
ciples which pervade the whole schiller objected that 
no such view of the objects of natural history had been 
pointed out by observation the only guide which the 
natural historians recommended and was disposed on this 
account to think the whole of their study narrow and shal 
low upon this says go the i expounded to him 
in as lively a way as i could the metamorphosis of plants 
drawing on paper for him as i proceeded a diagram to 
represent that general form of a plant which shows itself 
in so many and so various transformations schiller at 
tended and understood and accepting the explanation 
he said this is not observation but an idea i replied 



opposition op sensations and ideas 

adds gothe with some degree of irritation for the 
point which separated us was most luminously marked by 
this expression but i smothered my vexation and 
merely said i was happy to find that i had got ideas 
without knowing it nay that i saw them before my 
eyes gothe then goes on to say that he had been 
grieved to the very soul by maxims promulgated by 
schiller that no observed fact ever could correspond with 
an idea since he himself loved best to wander in the 
domain of external observation he had been led to look 
with repugnance and hostility upon anything which pro 
fessed to depend upon ideas yet he observes it 
occurred to me that if my observation was identical with 
his idea there must be some common ground on which 
we might meet they went on with their mutual ex 
planations and became intimate and lasting friends 
 and thus adds the poet by means of that mighty 
and interminable controversy between object and subject 
we two concluded an alliance which remained unbroken 
and produced much benefit to ourselves and others 

the general diagram of a plant of which gothe here 
speaks must have been a combination of lines and marks 
expressing the relations of position and equivalence among 
the elements of vegetable forms by which so many of 
their resemblances and differences may be explained 
such a symbol is not an idea in that general sense in 
which we propose to use the term but is a particular 
modification of the general ideas of symmetry develope 
ment and the like and we shall hereafter see according 
to the phraseology which we shall explain in the next 
chapter such a diagram might express the ideal conception 
of a plant 

 other modes of expressing this antithesis besides 
this antithesis of subjective and objective some of the 
more recent schools of german metaphysics have ex 

d 



 of ideas in general 

pressed the same opposition in other ways they 
have for instance divided the universe into the me and 
the notme ich and nicht ici upon such attempts we 
may observe that the fundamental distinction between 
our own thoughts and the objects of our thoughts is of 
the highest consequence but that if this distinction be 
clearly understood and recognised little appears to be 
gained by expressing it in any novel manner the most 
weighty part of the philosophers task is to analyse the 
operations of the mind and for this purpose it can aid us 
but little to call it instead of the mind the subject or the 
me whenever it appears that our views can be enun 
ciated more clearly by the use of such phraseology we 
shall not scruple to avail ourselves of it but we shall not 
think it necessary to dilate upon these different modes of 
expressing the same truth 



chapter v 
of ideal conceptions 

 by what has been said we are directed towards an 
analysis of our thoughts and our knowledge into two 
opposite elements sensations and ideas the latter ele 
ment will require further examination and this must be 
the more carefully conducted in consequence of the great 
vagueness and vacillation with which the term has com 
monly been used the word idea is not unfrequently 
employed to designate those conceptions which the mind 
forms and which it expresses by means of general terms 
for example taking as our plan requires instances 
from the sciences an angle a circle a central force a 
reflected or refracted ray a neutral salt a rose a reptile 
or again we may employ this term idea to express cer 



of ideal conceptions 

tain wider fields of mental apprehension each of which 
includes many such conceptions as the above as when 
we speak of the idea of space of time of number of 
cause of composition of resemblance of symmetry of 
organization it will be necessary for our purpose to dis 
tinguish these two modes of thought the latter i shall 
term fundamental ideas and i shall in the succeeding 
books enumerate and scrutinize such ideas in succession 
the other class of notions i shall term ideal conceptions 
for reasons which i shall soon state 

each of the fundamental ideas supplies us with many 
ideal conceptions thus straight lines angles polygons 
cubes tangents curvatures and the like are all modifi 
cations of the fundamental idea of space in like manner 
the fundamental idea of cause furnishes us with such con 
ceptions as accelerating and moving force pressure and 
inertia attraction and repulsion the fundamental idea 
of resemblance gives rise to the conceptions of class genus 
species and when followed into futher detail and deve 
loped by the suggestions of observation this along with 
other ideas produces the conception of a particular genus 
or species as a rose and so on in other cases 

 much perplexity and difference of opinion have pre 
vailed among metaphysicians respecting these ideal con 
ceptions it has been a matter of long and intricate 
discussion what is the object or act of thought which is 
denoted by general terms some have held that we have 
in our minds a real idea something of the nature of an 
image which we signify by such terms that we have in 
this sense a general idea of an angle a polygon a central 
force a crystal a rose others have held that in using 
such terms there is merely an act of the mind marked by 
a name an act by which the mind collects and connects 
many impressions these two views that of thejrealists 
and that of the nominalists have prevailed with various 



 of ideas in general 

fluctuations and modifications through all ages of philo 
sophy but that either opinion in its extreme form 
involves us in insuperable difficulties is easily seen and 
of late both parties appear to be willing to adopt the 
word conception as expressing that which by such terms 
we intend this word indicating both an act of the 
mind by which unity is given to that which was previously 
scattered and the result of the act abiding with us when 
the act is performed partakes of both views so far as 
each is true and will most conveniently aid us in pro 
ceeding with our analysis 

 but to the word conception i join the adjective 
ideal for we have to use the term not to describe the 
mental images of individual objects casually taken but 
to denote those definite abstract conceptions which are 
the subjects of our general knowledge these we can 
reason upon securely precisely because they are modi 
fications of our fundamental ideas for these ideas as we 
shall hereafter show contain the grounds of demonstra 
tive truth the conception of a circle is determined 
by relations involved in the idea of space and hence its 
properties can be certainly known the conception of 
mutual attraction involves necessary principles derived 
from theldea of cause the conception of a crystalline 
arrangement of particles involves the idea of symmetry 
and the case is similar in other examples hence i term 
these ideal conceptions intending by this designation to 
remind the reader that the unity which these conceptions 
give to the circumstances included in them is not a casual 
or arbitrary unity but is derived from the necessity of 
the case there are ideal relations which necessarily 
form the foundation of our knowledge in each province 
of human thought and these relations govern our con 
ceptions at first as well as determine the scientific truths 
which by means of our conceptions once formed we are 
able to enunciate 



of ideal conceptions 

 since the ideal conceptions of which we here speak 
are only modifications and limitations of the fundamental 
ideas themselves the reader will not think it strange 
that sometimes it may not be easy to draw a line of 
distinction between ideas and conceptions in the senses 
in which we have used the terms the modification 
may be of so comprehensive a character that it may 
appear almost as extensive as the idea itself and as well 
fitted to supply a foundation for general truths thus we 
may doubt whether number be a modification of the idea 
of time or an independent idea and some persons may 
decide that the idea of number supplies us with principles 
which are the proper foundation of arithmetic without 
any reference to the idea of time in like manner some 
may be of opinion that mechanical force is a distinct 
idea distinguishable from the idea of cause and capable 
of affording us those axioms on which the reasonings of 
the science of mechanics must rest now with respect 
to doubts and ambiguities of this kind we may observe 
that it is of small moment to our view of the philosophy 
of science how they are decided whether number 
and force be called ideas or conceptions they are funda 
mental so far as the sciences founded upon them are 
concerned and they partake of the nature of ideas 
at least so far as this that they are the sources of 
necessary truth as we shall hereafter show we shall 
analyse the truths of arithmetic and of mechanics so 
as to see that they depend upon our necessary mode 
of apprehending number and force whether we can 
analyse these modes of apprehension still further is 
another question not without interest in itself but not 
affecting our previous analysis hence it will not be 
inconsistent with the general course of our speculations 
if number force and the like very general modifications 
of our ideas should occasionally in these pages be 



 of ideas in general 

themselves termed ideas to reduce our fundamental 
ideas to the smallest possible number rigorously inde 
pendent of each other is a problem which perhaps we 
have not completely solved in the present work but any 
defect in the solution of this problem will by no means 
affect our general reasonings 

 it has been said by some writers that all concep 
tions whether ideal that is of such a general kind as 
those just adduced or conceptions of particular objects 
are merely states or feelings of the mind that these 
conceptions all belong to the mind in some way being 
its creations or acts or if any one prefers the expres 
sion its states or feelings although the latter terms appear 
far less appropriate it is superfluous to assert or to deny 
but if it be meant by saying that all conceptions are 
merely feelings of the mind to imply that this general 
description of them supersedes or diminishes the neces 
sity of examining minutely their differences their pro 
perties and the very curious and complex principles 
which they involve the opinion appears to be very 
unphilosophical and the phrase which suggests it is 
likely only to mislead us we shall we trust show 
hereafter that these acts or states of mind by whatever 
name they be called contain in them very fertile and 
varied elements of truth and we are in no way for 
warded in our pursuit of such elements by being told 
that all conceptions about which we can reason are 
merely so many states of the mind the question still 
remains what are the peculiarities of each of those 
states and to what conclusions do they entitle us to 
proceed when we say that the conceptions of straight 
lines and circles are merely states of the mind we rather 
increase than diminish the difficulty of understanding 

 bkownsj lectures vol ii 



of ideal conceptions 

how these states of mind and no other make the whole 
body of geometrical knowledge possible 

we must now endeavour to explain in what manner 
such ideal conceptions as those which we have pointed 
out enter into the formation of our knowledge 



chapter vi 
of induction 

 when we have become possessed of such ideal con 
ceptions as those just described cases frequently occur 
in which we can by means of such conceptions connect 
the facts which we learn from our senses and thus 
obtain truths from materials supplied by experience in 
such cases the truth to which we are thus led is said 
to be collected from the observed facts by induction 

thus hipparchus tracing the unequal motion of the 
sun among the stars in different parts of the year as 
learnt from observation found that this inequality 
might be fitly represented by the conception of an 
eccentric a circle in which the sun had an equable 
annual motion the spectator not being situated in the 
centre of the circle and thus he established by induc 
tion the truth that the sun appears to move in such an 
eccentric at a later period kepler proceeding upon 
more exact observations was able to show that not a 
circle about an eccentric point but an ellipse about the 
focus was the conception which truly agreed with the 
motion of the earth and of the other planets about the 
sun and thus the elliptical form of these orbits was 
established by induction from many observed facts 
again to take an example of another kind the forms of 
flowers may have applied to them conceptions borrowed 



 of ideas in general 

from the idea of symmetry of parts and this symmetry 
may contain three similar portions as in the lily and its 
tribe or five as in the wild rose and many others 
now it appears by observation of many particular cases 
that these differences in the kind of symmetry of the 
flower are conjoined with differences in the seed the 
tripartite symmetry prevailing in those seeds which have 
only one cotyledon or lobe enveloping the embryo and 
the quinquepartite symmetry in those seeds which have 
two cotyledons here then we have a truth concerning 
the laws of vegetable form established by induction 

in these and in all cases of induction the ideal con 
ception which the mind itself supplies is superinduced 
upon the facts as they are originally presented to obser 
vation before the inductive truth is detected the facts 
are there but they are many and unconnected the 
conception which the discoverer applies to them gives 
them connexion and unity before hipparchus it was 
known that the motion of the sun was not equable but 
it appeared to be irregular and lawless all parts of the 
motion became regular and orderly by the introduction 
of the conception of the eccentric in the case of hip 
parchus we can only conjecture the nature of the efforts 
by which the conception was discovered and applied 
to the facts but in keplers case we know from his 
own narrative how hard lie struggled and laboured to 
find the right conception how many conceptions he tried 
and rejected what corrections and adjustments of his 
first guesses he afterwards introduced in his case we 
see in the most conspicuous manner the philosopher 
impressing his own ideal conception upon the facts the 
facts being exactly fitted to this conception although no 
one before had detected such a fitness and in like 
manner in all other cases the discovery of a truth by 
 hist inductive sciences iii 



of induction 

induction consists in finding a conception or combination 
of conceptions which agrees with connects and arranges 
the facts 

 such ideal conceptions or combinations of concep 
tions superinduced upon the facts and reducing them to 
rule and order are theories and thus we seem to have 
again brought before us as a real and positive distinc 
tion that separation of fact and theory which in the 
outset of our inquiry chap ii we found ourselves com 
pelled to reject for we are at present led to this 
result that a theory is a truth collected from facts by 
induction that is by superinducing upon the facts ideal 
conceptions such as they truly agree with 

of the apparent contradiction thus brought before 
us the explanation is this that what we commonly 
term facts involve an act of the mind of the same 
kind as that which we have described as induction 
and thus do not in that respect differ essentially from 
theory thus we speak of the eccentric theory of the 
suns motions as collected by induction from the facts of 
his unequal motion at different times of the year but 
these facts are themselves theories collected by induction 
for they depend upon the conception of an ecliptic or 
circle passing round the heavens in which ecliptic the suns 
motion at each time is to be inferred by referring his 
places to the stars but this ecliptic and these modes of 
reference are manifestly creations of the mind and 
notwithstanding this artificial mode of measuring the 
suns motion the motion itself is as much a fact as the 
moons motion among the stars which is visible to the 
eye nor is there essentially any difference even in the 
mode of perceiving these motions for in our apprehen 
sion of the moons motion among the stars we assign to 
her a path and a velocity which are conceptions of our 
own minds and no mere impressions upon the senses 
and thus as theories are collected by induction from facts 



 of ideas in general 

facts are collected by an induction of the same kind from 
other facts and so on till we approach to bare impressions 
upon the senses which yet w r e can never quite divest of 
some conception or other the act of the mind by 
which it converts facts into theories is of the same kind 
as that by which it converts impressions into facts in 
both cases there is a new principle of unity introduced 
by the mind an ideal connexion established that which 
was many becomes one that which was loose and law 
less becomes connected and fixed by rule and this is 
done by induction or as we have described this process 
by superinducing upon the facts as given by observation 
the conception of our own minds 

 it has already been noticed that there is in different 
cases a wide difference as to the degree in which we are 
conscious of this operation in some cases we see the 
facts distinct and separate before they are brought to 
gether by the conception of our own minds in other 
cases we never contemplate them thus detached and 
can hardly conceive them under any other form than that 
which our conceptions give them yet it is easy to see 
that these two classes of cases pass into each other by in 
sensible gradations to take an example of this if we 
had to decipher an ancient inscription of which a few 
broken letters and imperfect marks only remained we 
might possibly by an intimate acquaintance with the lan 
guage in which it was written and with the usual forms 
of such inscriptions and by the aid of great sagacity and 
perseverance discover the meaning so that no doubt 
should remain of the justness of our conjecture in this 
case we might with propriety assert the import of the 
legend to be obtained by induction from the few facts 
which were placed before us if the inscription were 
entire and plainly legible we should without hesitation 
assert it to be a fact that we had before cur eyes the 
declaration whatever it was which the legend might con 



of induction 

tain yet in the latter case as well as in the former it is 
plain that there is much which the mind itself supplies in 
addition to the impressions which it receives much which 
it brings as well as that which it finds in the one case 
as in the other the reader must be provided with know 
ledge of the letters and of the language and if not in 
the same degree as in the other case yet no less neces 
sarily with attention and coherence of thought if there 
be induction in the one case it must exist more obscurely 
perhaps but no less certainly in the other also 

and thus it appears that understanding the term 
induction in that comprehensive sense in which alone it 
is consistent with itself it is requisite to give unity to a 
fact no less than to give connexion to a theory and the 
conclusion at which we formerly arrived that fact ana 
theory pass into each other by insensible degrees is not 
disturbed but confirmed and illustrated by our view of 
induction as the act of superinducing upon the impres 
sions of observation an ideal conception by which they 
receive connexion and unity 



chapter vii 
of successive generalizations 

 thus we are again led to the doctrine that fact and 
theory have no essential difference except in the degree 
of their certainty and familiarity theory when it 
becomes firmly established and steadily lodged in the 
mind becomes fact and thus as our knowledge becomes 
more sure and more extensive we are constantly trans 
ferring to the class of facts opinions which were at first 
regarded as theories 

now we have further to remark that in the progress 



 of ideas in general 

of human knowledge respecting any branch of speculation 
there may be several such steps in succession each 
depending upon and including the preceding the 
theoretical views which one generation of discoverers 
establishes become the facts from which the next gene 
ration advances to new theories as they rise from the 
particular to the general they rise from what is general 
to what is more general each induction supplies the 
materials of fresh inductions each generalization with 
all that it embraces in its circle may be found to be but 
one of many circles comprehended within the circuit of 
some wider generalization 

this remark has already been made and illustrated 
in the history of the inductive sciences and in truth 
the whole of the history of science is full of suggestions 
and exemplifications of this course of things it may be 
convenient however to select a few instances which may 
further explain and confirm this view of the progress of 
scientific knowledge 

 the most conspicuous instance of this succession is 
to be found in that science which has been progressive from 
the beginning of the world to our own times and which 
exhibits by far the richest collection of successive disco 
veries i mean astronomy it is easy to see that each of 
these successive discoveries depended on those antece 
dently made and that in each the truths which were the 
highest point of the knowledge of one age were the fun 
damental basis of the efforts of the age which came next 
thus we find in the days of greek discovery hipparchus 
and ptolemy combining and explaining the particular 
facts of the motion of the sun moon and planets by 
means of the theory of epicycles and eccentrics a highly 
important step which gave an intelligible connexion and 
rule to the motions of each of these luminaries when 

 hist inductive sciences ii 



of successive generalizations 

these cycles and epicycles thus truly representing the 
apparent motions of the heavenly bodies had accumulated 
to an inconvenient amount by the discovery of many 
inequalities in the observed motions copernicus showed 
that their effects might all be more simply included by 
making the sun the centre of motion of the planets in 
stead of the earth but in this new view he still retained 
the epicycles and eccentrics which governed the motion 
of each body tycho brahes observations and keplers 
calculations showed that besides the vast number of facts 
which the epicyclical theory could account for there were 
some which it would not exactly include and kepler was 
led to the persuasion that the planets move in ellipses 
but this view of motion was at first conceived by kepler 
as a modification of the conception of epicycles on one 
occasion he blames himself for not sooner seeing that such 
a modification was possible what an absurdity on my 
part he cries as if libra tion in the diameter of the 
epicycle might not come to the same thing as motion in 
the ellipse but again keplers laws of the elliptical 
motion of the planets were established and these laws 
immediately became the facts on which the mathema 
ticians had to found their mechanical theories from 
these facts newton as we have related proved that the 
central force of the sun retains the planets in their orbits 
according to the law of the inverse square of the dis 
tance the same law was shown to prevail in the gravi 
tation of the earth it was shown too by induction 
from the motions of jupiter and saturn that the planets 
attract each other by calculations from the figure of the 
earth that the parts of the earth attract each other and 
by considering the course of the tides that the sun and 
moon attract the waters of the ocean and all these 
curious discoveries being established as facts the subject 
 hist inductive sciences i 



 of ideas in general 

was ready for another step of generalization by an un 
paralleled rapidity in the progress of discovery in this 
case not only were all the inductions which we have first 
mentioned made by one individual but the new advance 
the higher flight the closing victory fell to the lot of the 
same extraordinary person 

the attraction of the sun upon the planets of the 
moon upon the earth of the planets on each other of the 
parts of the earth on themselves of the sun and moon 
upon the ocean all these truths each of itself a great 
discovery were included by newton in the higher gene 
ralization of the universal gravitation of matter by which 
each particle is drawn to each other according to the law 
of the inverse square and thus this long advance from 
discovery to discovery from truths to truths each justly 
admired when new and then rightly used as old was 
closed in a worthy and consistent manner by a truth 
which is the most worthy admiration because it includes 
all the researches of preceding ages of astronomy 

 we may take another example of a succession of 
this kind from the history of a science which though it 
has made wonderful advances has not yet reached its goal 
as physical astronomy appears to have done but seems to 
have before it a long prospect of future progress i now 
refer to chemistry in which i shall try to point out how 
the preceding discoveries afforded the materials of the 
succeeding although this subordination and connexion 
is in this case less familiar to mens minds than in astro 
nomy and is perhaps more difficult to present in a clear 
and definite shape sylvius saw in the facts which 
occur when an acid and an alkali are brought together 
the evidence that they neutralize each other but cases 
of neutralization and acidification and many other effects 
of mixture of the ingredients of bodies being thus viewed 
as facts had an aspect of unity and law given them by 



of successive generalizations 

geoffroy and bergman who introduced the conception 
of the chemical affinity or elective attraction by which 
certain elements select other elements as if by preference 
that combustion whether a chemical union or a chemi 
cal separation of ingredients is of the same nature with 
acidification was the doctrine of beccher and stahl and 
was soon established as a truth which must form a part 
of every succeeding physical theory that the rules of 
affinity and chemical composition may include gaseous 
elements was established by black and cavendish and 
all these truths thus brought to light by chemical disco 
verers affinity the identity of acidification and combus 
tion the importance of gaseous elements along with all 
the facts respecting the weight of ingredients and com 
pounds which the balance disclosed were taken up 
connected and included as particulars in the oxygen 
theory of lavoisier again the results of this theory and 
the quantity of the several ingredients which entered 
into each compound such results for the most part 
being now no longer mere theoretical speculations but 
recognised facts were the particulars from which dalton 
derived that wide law of chemical combination which we 
term the atomic theory and this law soon generally 
accepted among chemists is already in its turn become 
one of tq facts included in faradays theory of the identity 
of chemical affinity and electric attraction 

it is unnecessary to give further exemplifications of 
this constant ascent from one step to a higher this per 
petual conversion of true theories into the materials of 
other and wider theories it will hereafter be our busi 
ness to exhibit in a more full and formal manner the 
mode in which this principle determines the whole scheme 
and structure of all the most exact sciences and thus 
beginning with the facts of sense we gradually climb to 

 hist inductive sciences iii 
vol i e 



 of ideas in general 

the highest forms of human knowledge and obtain from 
experience and observation a vast collection of the most 
wide and elevated truths 

there are however truths of a very different kind to 
which we must turn our attention in order to pursue our 
researches respecting the nature and grounds of our 
knowledge but before we do this we must notice one 
more feature in that progress of science which we have 
already in part described 



chapter viii 
of technical terms 

 it has already been stated that we gather know 
ledge from the external world when we are able to apply 
to the facts which we observe some ideal conception 
which gives unity and connexion to multiplied and 
separate perceptions we have also shown that our 
conceptions thus verified by facts may themselves be 
united and connected by a new bond of the same nature 
and that man may thus have to pursue his way from 
truth to truth through a long progression of discoveries 
each resting on the preceding and rising above it 

it is now further to be noticed that each of these 
steps in succession is recorded fixed and made available 
by some peculiar form of words and such words thus 
rendered precise in their meaning and appropriated to 
the service of science we may call technical terms it 
is in a great measure by inventing such terms that men 
not only best express the discoveries they have made 
but also enable their followers to become so familiar 
with these discoveries and to possess them so thoroughly 
that they can readily use them in advancing to ulterior 
generalizations 



of technical terms 

most of our ideal conceptions are described by exact 
and constant words or phrases such as those of which we 
here speak we have already had occasion to employ 
many of these thus we have had instances of technical 
terms expressing geometrical conceptions as ellipsis 
radius vector axis plane the proportion of the inverse 
square and the like other terms have described mecha 
nical conceptions as accelerating force and attraction 
again chemistry exhibits as do all sciences a series of 
terms which mark the steps of her progress the views 
of the first real founders of the science are recorded by 
the terms which are still in use neutral salts affinity and 
the like the establishment of daltons theory has pro 
duced the use of the word atom in a peculiar sense or 
of some other word as proportion in a sense equally 
technical and mr faraday has found it necessary in 
order to expound his electrochemical theory to intro 
duce such terms as anode and cathode anion and cathion 

 i need not adduce any further examples for my 
object at present is only to point out the use and influence 
of such language its rules and principles i shall hereafter 
try in some measure to fix but what we have here to 
remark is the extraordinary degree in which the progress 
of science is facilitated by thus investing each new dis 
covery with a compendious and steady form of expression 
these terms soon become part of the current language of 
all who take an interest in speculation however strange 
they may sound at first they soon grow familiar in our 
ears and are used without any effort or recollection of the 
difficulty they once involved they become as common 
as the phrases which express our most frequent feelings 
and interests while yet they have incomparably more 
precision than belongs to any terms which express feel 
ings and they carry with them in their import the results 
of deep and laborious trains of research they convey the 

e 



 of ideas in general 

mental treasures of one period to the generations that 
follow and laden with this their precious freight they sail 
safely across gulfs of time in which empires have suffered 
shipwreck and the languages of common life have sunk 
into oblivion we have still in constant circulation 
among us the terms which belong to the geometry the 
astronomy the zoology the medicine of the greeks and 
the algebra and chemistry of the arabians and we can 
in an instant by means of a few words call to our own 
recollection or convey to the apprehension of another 
person phenomena and relations of phenomena in optics 
mineralogy chemistry which are so complex and abstruse 
that it might seem to require the utmost subtlety of the 
human mind to grasp them even if that were made the 
sole object of its efforts by this remarkable effect of 
technical language we have the results of all the labours 
of past times not only always accessible but so prepared 
that we may provided we are careful in the use of our 
instrument employ what is really useful and efficacious 
for the purpose of further success without being in any 
way impeded or perplexed by the length and weight of 
the chain of past connexions which we drag along 
with us 

by such means by the use of the inductive process 
and by the aid of technical terms man has been constantly 
advancing in the path of scientific truth in a succeed 
ing part of this work we shall endeavour to trace the 
general rules of this advance and to lay down the maxims 
by which it may be most successfully guided and for 
warded but in order that we may do this to the best 
advantage we must pursue still further the analysis of 
knowledge into its elements and this will be our employ 
ment in the first part of the work 



chapter ix 
of necessary and contingent truths 

 course of the argument every advance in human 
knowledge consists as we have seen in adapting 
new ideal conceptions to ascertained facts and thus 
in superinducing the form upon the matter the active 
upon the passive processes of our minds every such 
step introduces into our knowledge an additional portion 
of the ideal element and of those relations which flow 
from the nature of ideas it is therefore important for 
our purpose to examine more closely this element and to 
learn what the relations are which may thus come to form 
part of our knowledge an inquiry into those ideas 
which form the foundations of our sciences into the 
reality independence extent and principal heads of the 
knowledge which we thus acquire is a task on which we 
must now enter and which will employ us for several of 
the succeeding books 

in this inquiry our object will be to pass in review all 
the most important fundamental ideas which our sciences 
involve and to prove more distinctly in reference to 
each what we have already asserted with regard to 
all that there are everywhere involved in our knowledge 
acts of the mind as well as impressions of sense and that 
our knowledge derives from these acts a generality cer 
tainty and evidence which the senses could in no degree 
have supplied but before i proceed to do this in par 
ticular cases i will give some account of the argument 
in its general form 

we have already considered the separation of our 
knowledge into its two elements impressions of sense 
and ideas as evidently indicated by this that all know 
ledge possesses characters which neither of these elements 



 of ideas in general 

alone could bestow without our ideas our sensations 
could have no connexion without external impressions 
our ideas would have no reality and thus both ingredi 
ents of our knowledge must exist but there is another 
mode in which we may prove the distinct and indepen 
dent existence of these two elements namely by con 
sidering that there are two large classes of truths which 
differ entirely from each other and of which the differ 
ence arises from this that the one class derives its 
nature from the one and the other from the other of 
these two elements these are what are technically 
termed necessary and contingent truths truths of demon 
stration and truths of experience i shall first point out 
the difference of these two kinds of truths which differ 
ence is briefly this that the former are true universally 
and necessarily the latter only learnt from experience 
and limited by experience i shall show that upon vari 
ous subjects we possess truths of the former kind that 
the universality and necessity which distinguish them can 
by no means be derived from experience that these cha 
racters do in reality flow from the ideas which these 
truths involve and that when their necessity is exhibited 
in the way of logical demonstration it is found to depend 
upon certain fundamental principles definitions and 
axioms which may thus be considered as expressing 
n some measure the essential characters of our ideas 
these fundamental principles i shall afterwards proceed to 
discuss and to exhibit in each of the principal depart 
ments of science 

 of necessary truths necessary truths are those 
in which we not only learn that the proposition is 
true but see that it must be true in which the negation 
of the truth is not only false but impossible in which 
we cannot even by an effort of imagination or in a sup 
position conceive the reverse of that which is asserted 



of necessary and contingent truths 

that there are such truths cannot be doubted we 
may take for example all relations of number three 
and two added together make five we cannot con 
ceive it to be otherwise we cannot by any freak of 
thought imagine three and two to make seven 

it may be said that this assertion merely expresses 
what we mean by our words that it is a matter of defi 
nition that the proposition is an identical one 

but this is by no means so the definition of five is 
not three and two but four and one how does it 
appear that three and two is the same number as four 
and one it is evident that it is so but why is it evi 
dent not because the proposition is identical for if 
that were the reason all numerical propositions must be 
evident for the same reason if it be a matter of defi 
nition that and make it must be a matter of defi 
nition that and make but who will say that 
the definition of is and yet the magnitude 
of the numbers can make no difference in the ground of 
the truth how do we know that the product of and 
 is less than the product of and we see 
that it is so if we perform certain operations by the rules 
of arithmetic but how do we know the truth of the 
rules of arithmetic if we divide by 
according to the process taught us at school how are we 
assured that the result is correct and that the number 
 thus obtained is really the number of times one 
number is contained in the other 

the correctness of the rule it may be replied can be 
rigorously demonstrated it can be shown that the pro 
cess must inevitably give the true quotient 

certainly this can be shown to be the case and 
precisely because it can be shown that the result must be 
true we have here an example of a necessary truth and 
this truth it appears is not therefore necessary because it 



 of ideas in general 

is itself evidently identical however it may be possible to 
prove it by reducing it to evidently identical propositions 
and the same is the case with all other numerical propo 
sitions for as we have said the nature of all of them is 
the same 

here then we have instances of truths which are not 
only true but demonstrably and necessarily tr u e now such 
truths are in this respect at least altogether different 
from truths which however certain they may be are 
learnt to be so only by the evidence of observation in 
terpreted as observation must be interpreted by our own 
mental faculties there is no difficulty in finding ex 
amples of these merely observed truths we find that 
sugar dissolves in water and forms a transparent fluid 
but no one will say that we can see any reason beforehand 
why the result must be so we find that all animals 
which chew the cud also have the divided hoof but could 
any one have predicted that this would be universally the 
case or supposing the truth of the rule to be known can 
any one say that he cannot conceive the facts as occurring 
otherwise water expands when it crystallizes some 
other substances contract in the same circumstances but 
can any one know that this will be so otherwise than by 
observation we have here propositions rigorously true 
we will assume but can any one say they are necessarily 
true these and the great mass of the doctrines esta 
blished by induction are actual but so far as we can see 
accidental laws results determined by some unknown se 
lection not demonstrable consequences of the essence of 
things inevitable and perceived to be inevitable according 
to the phraseology which has been frequently used by phi 
losophical writers they are contingent not necessary truths 

it is requisite to insist upon this opposition because 
no insight can be obtained into the true nature of 
knowledge and the mode of arriving at it by any one 



of necessary and contingent truths 

who does not clearly appreciate the distinction the 
separation of truths which are learnt by observation and 
truths which can be seen to be true by a pure act of 
thought is one of the first and most essential steps in 
our examination of the nature of truth and the mode of 
its discovery if any one does not clearly comprehend 
this distinction of necessary and contingent truths he 
will not be able to go along with us in our researches 
into the foundations of human knowledge nor indeed 
to pursue with success any speculation on the subject 
but in fact this distinction is one that can hardly fail 
to be at once understood it is insisted upon by almost 
all the best modern as well as ancient metaphysicians 
as of primary importance and if any person does not 
fully apprehend at first the different kinds of truth thus 
pointed out let him study to some extent those sciences 
which have necessary truth for their subject as geometry 
or the properties of numbers so as to obtain a familiar 
acquaintance with such truth and he will then hardly 
fail to see how different the evidence of the propositions 
which occur in these sciences is from the evidence of 
the facts which are merely learnt from experience 
that the year goes through its course in days can 
only be known by observation of the sun or stars that 
 days is weeks and a day it requires no expe 
rience but only a little thought to perceive that bees 
build their cells in the form of hexagons we cannot 
know without looking at them that regular hexagons 
may be arranged so as to fill space may be proved with 
the utmost rigour even if there were not in existence 
such a thing as a material hexagon 

i have taken examples of necessary truths from the 
properties of number and space but such truths exist 
no less in other subjects although the discipline of 

 aristotle dr whately dugald stewart c 



 of ideas in general 

thought which is requisite to perceive them distinctly 
may not be so usual among men with regard to the 
sciences of mechanics and hydrostatics as it is with 
regard to the sciences of geometry and arithmetic yet 
every one may perceive that there are such truths in 
mechanics if i press the table with my hand the 
table presses my hand with an equal force here is a 
selfevident and necessary truth in any machine 
constructed in whatever manner to increase the force 
which i can exert it is certain that what i gain in force 
i must lose in the velocity which i communicate this 
is not a contingent truth borrowed from and limited by 
observation for a man of sound mechanical views applies 
it with like confidence however novel be the construc 
tion of the machine when i come to speak of the ideas 
which are involved in our mechanical knowledge i 
may perhaps be able to bring more clearly into view 
the necessary truth of general propositions on such 
subjects that reaction is equal and opposite to action 
is as necessarily true as that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space it is as impossible theoretically to make 
a perpetual motion by mere mechanism as to make the 
diagonal of a square commensurable with the side 

the existence of these two kinds of truth necessary 
and contingent and their separate nature being estab 
lished or allowed we proceed onwards with the argument 

necessary truths must be universal truths if any 
property belong to a rightangled triangle necessarily it 
must belong to all rightangled triangles and it shall be 
proved in the following chapter that truths possessing 
these two characters of necessity and universality can 
not possibly be the mere results of experience 



 

chapter x 
of experience 

 i here employ the term experience in a more 
definite and limited sense than it possesses in common 
usage for i restrict it to matters belonging to the 
domain of science in such cases the knowledge which 
we acquire by means of experience is of a clear and 
precise nature and the passions and feelings and 
interests which make the lessons of experience in prac 
tical matters so difficult to read aright no longer disturb 
and confuse us we may therefore hope by attending 
to such cases to learn what efficacy experience really 
has in the discovery of truth 

that from experience including intentional expe 
rience or observation we obtain much knowledge which 
is highly important and which could not be procured 
from any other source is abundantly clear we have 
already taken several examples of such kuowledge 
we know by experience that animals which ruminate 
are clovenhoofed and we know this in no other 
manner we know in like manner that all the 
planets and their satellites revolve round the sun from 
west to east it has been found by experience that all 
meteoric stones contain chrome many similar portions 
of our knowledge might be mentioned 

now what we have here to remark is this that in 
no case can experience prove a proposition to be neces 
sarily or universally true however many instances we 
may have observed of the truth of a proposition yet if it 
be merely observation there is nothing to assure us that 
the next case shall not be an exception to the rule if 
it be strictly true that every ruminant animal yet known 
has cloven hoofs we still cannot be sure that some 



 of ideas in general 

creature will not hereafter be discovered which has the 
first of these attributes without having the other 
when the planets and their satellites as far as saturn 
had been all found to move round the sun in one direc 
tion it was still possible that there might be other such 
bodies not obeying this rule and accordingly when the 
satellites of uranus were detected they appeared to 
offer an exception of this kind even in the mathe 
matical sciences we have examples of such rules sug 
gested by experience and also of their precariousness 
however far they may have been tested we cannot 
depend upon their correctness except we see some 
reason for the rule for instance various rules have 
been given for the purpose of pointing out prime 
numbers that is those which cannot be divided by any 
other number we may try as an example of such a 
rule this one any odd power of the number two dimi 
nished by one thus the third power of two diminished 
by one is seven the fifth power diminished by one is 
thirtyone the seventh power so diminished is one 
hundred and twentyseven all these are prime num 
bers and we might be led to suppose that the rule is 
universal but the next example shows us the falla 
ciousness of such a belief the ninth power of two 
diminished by one is five hundred and eleven which is 
not a prime being divisible by seven 

experience must always consist of a limited nnmber 
of observations and however numerous these may be 
they can show nothing with regard to the infinite 
number of cases in which the experiment has not been 
made experience being thus unable to prove a fact to 
be universal is as will readily be seen still more 
incapable of proving a truth to be necessary expe 
rience cannot indeed offer the smallest ground for the 
necessity of a proposition she can observe and record 



of experience 

what has happened but she cannot find in any case or 
in any accumulation of cases any reason for what must 
happen she may see objects side by side but she 
cannot see a reason why they must ever be side by side 
she finds certain events to occur in succession but the 
succession supplies in its occurrence no reason for its 
recurrence she contemplates external objects but she 
cannot detect any internal bond which indissolubly 
connects the future with the past the possible with the 
real to learn a proposition by experience and to see it 
to be necessarily true are two altogether different pro 
cesses of thought 

 but it may be said that we do learn by means of 
observation and experience many universal truths 
indeed all the general truths of which science consists 
is not the doctrine of universal gravitation learnt by 
experience are not the laws of motion the properties 
of light the general principles of chemistry so learnt 
how with these examples before us can we say that 
experience teaches no universal truths 

to this we reply that these truths can only be 
known to be general not universal if they depend upon 
experience alone experience cannot bestow that uni 
versality which she herself cannot have and that necessity 
of which she has no comprehension if these doctrines 
are universally true this universality flows from the ideas 
which we apply to our experience and which are as we 
have seen the real sources of necessary truth how far 
these ideas can communicate their universality and 
necessity to the results of experience it will hereafter be 
our business to consider it will then appear that when 
the mind collects from observation truths of a wide and 
comprehensive kind which approach to the simplicity 
and universality of the truths of pure science she gives 



of ideas in general 

them this character by throwing upon them the light of 
her own fundamental ideas 

but the truths which we discover by observation of 
the external world even when most strikingly simple 
and universal are not necessary truths is the doctrine 
of universal gravitation necessarily true it was doubted 
by clairaut so far as it refers to the moon when the pro 
gression of the apogee in fact appeared to be twice as 
great as the theory admitted it has been doubted even 
more recently with respect to the planets their mutual 
perturbations appearing to indicate a deviation from the 
law it is doubted still by some persons with respect 
to the double stars but suppose all these doubts to be 
banished and the law to be universal is it then proved 
to be necessary manifestly not the very existence of 
these doubts proves that it is not so for the doubts were 
dissipated by reference to observation and calculation 
not by reasoning on the nature of the law clairauts 
difficulty was removed by a more exact calculation of 
the effect of the suns force on the motion of the apogee 
the suggestion of bessel that the intensity of gra 
vitation might be different for different planets was 
found to be unnecessary when professor airy gave 
a more accurate determination of the mass of jupiter 
and the question whether the extension of the law of 
the inverse square to the double stars be true one of 
the most remarkable questions now before the scientific 
world must be answered not by any speculations 
concerning what the laws of attraction must necessarily 
be but by carefully determining the laws of the motion 
of these curious objects by means of the observations 
such as those which sir john herschel has collected for 
that purpose by his unexampled survey of both hemi 
spheres of the sky and since the extent of this truth is 



of experience 

thus to be determined by reference to observed facts it 
is clear that no mere accumulation of them can make its 
universality certain or its necessity apparent 

thus no knowledge of the necessity of any truths 
can result from the observation of what really happens 
this being clearly understood we are led to an import 
ant inquiry 

the characters of universality and necessity in the 
truths which form part of our knowledge can never 
be derived from the experience by which so large a 
part of our knowledge is obtained but since as we 
have seen we really do possess a large body of truths 
which are necessary and because necessary therefore 
universal the question still recurs from what source 
these characters of universality and necessity are 
derived 

the answer to this question we will attempt to give 
in the next chapter 



chapter xi 
of the grounds of necessary truths 

 to the question just stated i reply that the necessity 
and universality of the truths which form a part of our 
knowledge are derived from the fundamental ideas which 
those truths involve these ideas entirely shape and cir 
cumscribe our knowledge they regulate the active opera 
tions of our minds without which our passive sensations 
do not become knowledge they govern these operations 
according to rules which are not only fixed and perma 
nent but which may be expressed in plain and definite 
terms and these rules when thus expressed may be made 
the basis of demonstrations by which the necessary rela 
tions imparted to our knowledge by our ideas may be 



 of ideas in general 

traced to their consequences in the most remote ramifi 
cations of scientific truth 

these enunciations of the necessary and evident con 
ditions imposed upon our knowledge by the fundamental 
ideas which it involves are termed axioms thus the 
axioms of geometry express the necessary conditions 
which result from the idea of space the axioms of 
mechanics express the necessary conditions which flow 
from the ideas of force and motion and so on 

 it will be the office of several of the succeeding 
books of this work to establish and illustrate in detail what 
i have thus stated in general terms i shall there pass in 
review many of the most important fundamental ideas 
on which the existing body of our science depends and 
i shall endeavour to show for each such idea in succes 
sion that knowledge involves an active as well as a passive 
element that it is not possible without an act of the 
mind regulated by certain laws i shall further attempt 
to enumerate some of the principal fundamental relations 
which each idea thus introduces into our thoughts and 
to express them by means of definitions and axioms and 
other suitable forms 

i will only add a remark or two to illustrate further 
this view of the ideal grounds of our knowledge 

 to persons familiar with any of the demonstrative 
sciences it will be apparent that if we state all the defini 
tions and axioms which are employed in the demon 
strations we state the whole basis on which those 
reasonings rest for the whole process of demonstrative 
or deductive reasoning in any science as in geometry for 
instance consists entirely in combining some of these 
first principles so as to obtain the simplest propositions of 
the science then combining these so as to obtain other 
propositions of greater complexity and so on till we 
advance to the most recondite demonstrable truths these 



grounds of necessary truths 

last however intricate and unexpected still involving no 
principles except the original definitions and axioms 
thus by combining the definition of a triangle and of 
equal lines and equal angles namely that they are such 
as when applied to each other coincide with the axiom 
respecting straight lines that two such lines cannot 
inclose a space we demonstrate the equality of triangles 
under certain assumed conditions again by combining 
this result with the definition of parallelograms and with 
the axiom that if equals be taken from equals the wholes 
are equal we prove the equality of parallelograms between 
the same parallels and upon the same base from this 
proposition again we prove the equality of the square on 
the hypotenuse of a triangle to the squares on the two 
sides containing the right angle but in all this there is 
nothing contained which is not rigorously the result of 
our geometrical definitions and axioms all the rest of 
our treatises of geometry consists only of terms and 
phrases of reasoning the object of which is to connect 
those first principles and to exhibit the effects of their 
combination in the shape of demonstration 

 this combination of first principles takes place 
according to the forms and rules of logic all the steps 
of the demonstration may be stated in the shape in which 
logicians are accustomed to exhibit processes of reasoning 
in order to show their conclusiveness that is in syllo 
gisms thus our geometrical reasonings might be resolved 
into such steps as the following 

all straight lines drawn from the centre of a circle to 
its circumference are equal 

but the straight lines ab ac are drawn from the 
centre of a circle to its circumference 

therefore the straight lines a b ac are equal 

each step of geometrical and all other demonstrative 
reasoning may be resolved into three such clauses as 
vol i f 



 of ideas in general 

these and these three clauses are termed respectively 
the major premiss the minor premiss and the conclusion 
or more briefly the major the minor and the con 
clusion 

the principle which justifies the reasoning when exhi 
bited in this syllogistic form is this that a truth which 
can be asserted as generally or rather as universally true 
can be asserted as true also in each particular case the 
minor only asserts a certain particular case to be an 
example of such conditions as are spoken of in the major 
and hence the conclusion which is true of the major by 
supposition is true of the minor by consequence and 
thus we proceed from syllogism to syllogism in each one 
employing some general truth in some particular instance 
any proof which occurs in geometry or any other 
science of demonstration may thus be reduced to a series 
of processes in each of which we pass from some gene 
ral proposition to the narrower and more special propo 
sitions which it includes and this process of deriving 
truths by the mere combination of general principles 
applied in particular hypothetical cases is called deduc 
tion being opposed to induction in which as we have 
seen a new general principle is introduced at every step 

 now we have to remark that this being so however 
far we follow such deductive reasoning we can never have 
in our conclusion any truth which is not virtually included 
in the original principles from which the reasoning started 
for since at any step we merely take out of a general 
proposition something included in it while at the pre 
ceding step we have taken this general proposition out of 
one more general and so on perpetually it is manifest 
that our last result was really included in the principle 
or principles with which we began i say principles 
because although our logical conclusion can only exhibit 
the legitimate issue of our first principles it may never 



grounds of necessary truths 

theless contain the result of the combination of several 
such principles and may thus assume a great degree of 
complexity and may appear so far removed from the 
parent truths as to betray at first sight hardly any rela 
tionship with them thus the proposition which has 
already been quoted respecting the squares on the sides 
of a rightangled triangle contains the results of many 
elementary principles as the definitions of parallels tri 
angle and square the axioms respecting straight lines 
and respecting parallels and perhaps others the con 
clusion is complicated by containing the effects of the 
combination of all these elements but it contains no 
thing and can contain nothing but such elements and 
their combinations 

this doctrine that logical reasoning produces no new 
truths but only unfolds and brings into view those truths 
which were in effect contained in the first principles of 
the reasoning is assented to by almost all who in modern 
times have attended to the science of logic such a view 
is admitted both by those who defend and by those who 
depreciate the value of logic whatever is established 
by reasoning must have been contained and virtually 
asserted in the premises the only truth which such 
propositions can possess consists in conformity to the 
original principles 

in this manner the whole substance of our geo 
metry is reduced to the definitions and axioms which we 
employ in our elementary reasonings and in like manner 
we reduce the demonstrative truths of any other science 
to the definitions and axioms which we there employ 

 but in reference to this subject it has sometimes 
been said that demonstrative sciences do in reality depend 
upon definitions only and that additional kind of 

 whateleys logic pp 

f 



 of ideas in general 

principle such as we have supposed axioms to be is 
absolutely required it has been asserted that in geo 
metry for example the source of the necessary truth of 
our propositions is this that they depend upon definitions 
alone and consequently merely state the identity of the 
same thing under different aspects 

that in the sciences which admit of demonstration as 
geometry mechanics and the like axioms as well as defi 
nitions are needed in order to express the grounds of 
our necessary convictions must be shown hereafter by an 
examination of each of these sciences in particular but 
that the propositions of these sciences those of geometry 
for example do not merely assert the identity of the same 
thing will i think be generally allowed if we consider 
the assertions which we are enabled to make when 
we declare that a straight line is the shortest distance 
between two points is this merely an identical proposi 
tion the definition of a straight line in another form 
not so the definition of a straight line involves the 
notion of form only and does not contain anything about 
magnitude consequently it cannot contain anything 
equivalent to shortest thus the propositions of geo 
metry are not merely identical propositions nor have 
we in their general character anything to countenance 
the assertion that they are the results of definitions 
alone and when we come to examine this and other 
sciences more closely we shall find that axioms such as 
are usually in our treatises made the fundamental prin 
ciples of our demonstrations neither have ever been nor 
can be dispensed with axioms as well as definitions 
are in all cases requisite in order properly to exhibit the 
grounds of necessary truth 

 thus the real logical basis of every body of demon 
strated truths are the definitions and axioms which are 
the first principles of the reasonings but when we are 



grounds of necessary truths 

arrived at this point the question further occurs what is 
the ground of the truth of these axioms it is not the 
logical but the philosophical not the formal but the real 
foundation of necessary truth which we are seeking 
hence this inquiry what is the ground of the axioms of 
geometry of mechanics and of any other demonstrable 
science necessarily comes before us 

the answer which we are led to give by the view 
which we have taken of the nature of knowledge has 
already been stated the ground of the axioms belong 
ing to each science is the idea which the axiom involves 
the ground of the axioms of geometry is the idea of 
space the ground of the axioms of mechanics is the 
idea of force of action and reaction and the like and 
hence these ideas are fundamental ideas and since 
they are thus the foundations not only of demonstration 
but of truth an examination into their real import and 
nature is of the greatest consequence to our purpose 

 not only the axioms but the definitions which 
form the basis of our reasonings depend upon our funda 
mental ideas and the definitions are not arbitrary defi 
nitions but are determined by a necessity no less rigorous 
than the axioms themselves we could not think of 
geometrical truths without conceiving a circle and we 
could not reason concerning such truths without defining 
a circle in some mode equivalent to that which is com 
monly adopted the definitions of parallels of right 
angles and the like are quite as necessarily prescribed 
by the nature of the case as the axioms which these defi 
nitions bring with them indeed we may substitute one 
of these kinds of principles for another we cannot 
always put a definition in the place of an axiom but we 
may always find an axiom which shall take the place of 
a definition if we assume a proper axiom respecting 
straight lines we need no definition of a straight line 



 of ideas in general 

but in whatever shape the principle appear as definition 
or as axiom it has about it nothing casual or arbitrary 
but is determined to be what it is as to its import by the 
most rigorous necessity growing out of the idea of space 

 these principles definitions and axioms thus 
exhibiting the primary developements of a fundamental 
idea do in fact express the idea so far as its expression 
in words forms part of our science they are different 
views of the same body of truth and though each prin 
ciple by itself exhibits only one aspect of this body 
taken together they convey a sufficient conception of it 
for our purposes the idea itself cannot be fixed in 
words but these various lines of truth proceeding from 
it suggest sufficiently to a fitlyprepared mind the place 
where the idea resides its nature and its efficacy 

it is true that these principles our elementary defi 
nitions and axioms even taken altogether express the 
idea incompletely thus the definitions and axioms of 
geometry as they are stated in our elementary works do 
not fully express the idea of space as it exists in our 
minds for in addition to these other axioms indepen 
dent of these and no less evident can be stated and are 
in fact stated when we come to the higher geometry 
such for instance is the axiom of archimedes that a 
curve line which joins two points is less than a broken 
line which joins the same points and includes the curve 
and thus the idea is disclosed but not fully revealed 
imparted but not transfused by the use we make of it 
in science when we have taken from the fountain so 
much as serves our purpose there still remains behind a 
deep well of truth which we have not exhausted and 
which we may easily believe to be inexhaustible 



 



chapter xii 

the fundamental ideas are not derived 
from experience 

 by the course of speculation contained in the last 
three chapters we are again led to the conclusion which 
we have already stated that our knowledge contains an 
ideal element and that this element is not derived from 
experience for we have seen that there are proposi 
tions which are known to be necessarily true and that 
such knowledge is not and cannot be obtained by mere 
observation of actual facts it has been shown also that 
these necessary truths are the results of certain funda 
mental ideas such as those of space number and the 
like hence it follows inevitably that these ideas and 
others of the same kind are not derived from experience 
for these ideas possess a power of infusing into their 
developements that very necessity which experience can 
in no way bestow this power they do not borrow from 
the external world but possess by their own nature thus 
we unfold out of the idea of space the propositions of 
geometry which are plainly truths of the most rigorous 
necessity and universality but if the idea of space were 
merely collected from observation of the external world 
it could never enable or entitle us to assert such proposi 
tions it could never authorize us to say that not merely 
some lines but all lines not only have but must have 
those properties which geometry teaches geometry in 
every proposition speaks a language which experience 
never dares to utter and indeed of which she but half 
comprehends the meaning experience sees that the 
assertions are true but she sees not how profound and 
absolute is their truth she unhesitatingly assents to 
the laws which geometry delivers but she does not pre 



 of ideas in general 

tend to see the origin of their obligation she is always 
ready to acknowledge the sway of pure scientific prin 
ciples as a matter of fact but she does not dream of offer 
ing her opinion on their authority as a matter of right 
still less can she justly claim to be herself the source of 
that authority 

david hume asserted that we are incapable of seeing 
in any of the appearances which the world presents any 
thing of necessary connexion and hence he inferred that 
our knowledge cannot extend to any such connexion 
it will be seen from what we have said that we assent to 
his remark as to the fact but we differ from him alto 
gether in the consequence to be drawn from it our 
inference from humes observation is not the truth of 
his conclusion but the falsehood of his premises not 
that therefore we can know nothing of natural con 
nexion but that therefore we have some other source of 
knowledge than experience not that we can have no 
idea of connexion or causation because in his language 
it cannot be the copy of an impression but that since 
we have such an idea our ideas are not the copies of our 
impressions 

since it thus appears that our fundamental ideas are 
not acquired from the external world by our senses but 
have some separate and independent origin it is import 
ant for us to examine their nature and properties as they 
exist in themselves and this it will be our business to do 
through a portion of the following pages but it may be 
proper first to notice one or two objections w hich may 
possibly occur 

 it may be said that without the use of our senses 
of sight and touch for instance we should never have any 
idea of space that this idea therefore may properly be 
said to be derived from those senses and to this i reply 

 essay s vol ii p 



fundamental ideas not derivative 

by referring to a parallel instance without light we 
should have no perception of visible figure yet the 
power of perceiving visible figure cannot be said to be 
derived from the light but resides in the structure of the 
eye if we had never seen objects in the light we should 
be quite unaware that we possessed a power of vision yet 
we should not possess it the less on that account if we 
had never exercised the senses of sight and touch if we 
can conceive such a state of human existence we know 
not that we should be conscious of an idea of space 
but the light reveals to us at the same time the existence 
of external objects and our own power of seeing and 
in a very similar manner the exercise of our senses dis 
closes to us at the same time the external world and 
our own ideas of space time and other conditions with 
out which the external world can neither be observed nor 
conceived that light is necessary to vision does not in 
any degree supersede the importance of a separate exa 
mination of the laws of our visual powers if we would 
understand the nature of our own bodily faculties and 
the extent of the information they can give us in like 
manner the fact that intercourse with the external world 
is necessary for the conscious employment of our ideas 
does not make it the less essential for us to examine those 
ideas in their most intimate structure in order that we 
may understand the grounds and limits of our know 
ledge even before we see a single object we have a 
faculty of vision and in like manner if we can suppose 
a man who has never contemplated an object in space or 
time we must still assume him to have the faculties of 
entertaining the ideas of space and time which faculties 
are called into play on the very first occasion of the use 
of the senses 

 in answer to such remarks as the above it has 
sometimes been said that to assume separate faculties in 



 of ideas in general 

the mind for so many different processes of thought is to 
give a mere verbal explanation since we learn nothing 
concerning our idea of space by being told that we have 
a faculty of forming such an idea it has been said that 
this course of explanation leads to an endless multipli 
cation of elements in mans nature without any advan 
tage to our knowledge of his true constitution we 
may it is said assert man to have a faculty of walking 
of standing of breathing of speaking but what it is 
asked is gained by such assertions to this i reply that 
we undoubtedly have such faculties as those just named 
that it is by no means unimportant to consider them and 
that the main question in such cases is whether they are 
separate and independent faculties or complex and deri 
vative ones and if the latter be the case what are the 
simple and original faculties by the combination of which 
the others are produced in walking standing breath 
ing for instance a great part of the operation can be re 
duced to one single faculty the voluntary exercise of our 
muscles but in breathing this does not appear to be 
the whole of the process the operation is in part at 
least involuntary and it has been held that there is a 
certain sympathetic action of the nerves in addition to 
the voluntary agency which they transmit which is essen 
tial to the function to determine whether or no this 
sympathetic faculty is real and distinct and if so what 
are its laws and limits is certainly a highly philosophical 
inquiry and well deserving the attention which has been 
bestowed upon it by eminent physiologists and just of 
the same nature are the inquiries with respect to mans 
intellectual constitution on which we propose to enter 
for instance man has a faculty of apprehending time and 
a faculty of reckoning numbers are these distinct or is 
one faculty derived from the other to analyse the vari 
ous combinations of our ideas and observations into the 



fundamental ideas not derivative 

original faculties which they involve to show that these 
faculties are original and not capable of further analysis 
to point out the characters which mark these faculties 
and lead to the most important features of our know 
ledge these are the kind of researches on which we 
have now to enter and these we trust will be found 
to be far from idle or useless parts of our plan if we 
succeed in such attempts it will appear that it is by 
no means a frivolous or superfluous step to distinguish 
separate faculties in the mind if we do not learn much 
by being told that we have a faculty of forming the idea 
of space we at least by such a commencement circum 
scribe a certain portion of the field of our investigations 
which we shall afterwards endeavour to show requires 
and rewards a special examination and though we shall 
thus have to separate the domain of our philosophy into 
many provinces these are as we trust it will appear 
neither arbitrarily assigned nor vague in their limits nor 
infinite in number 



chapter xiii 
of the philosophy of the sciences 

s 

we proceed in the ensuing books to the closer 
examination of a considerable number of those funda 
mental ideas on which the sciences hitherto most suc 
cessfully cultivated are founded in this task our 
objects will be to explain and analyse such ideas so as 
to bring into view the definitions and axioms or other 
forms in which we may clothe the conditions to which 
our speculative knowledge is subjected i shall also 
try to prove for some of these ideas in particular what 
has been already urged respecting them in general that 



 of ideas in general 

they are not derived from observation but necessarily 
impose their conditions upon that knowledge of which 
observation supplies the materials i shall further in 
some cases endeavour to trace the history of these ideas 
as they have successively come into notice in the progress 
of science the gradual developement by which they have 
arrived at their due purity and clearness and as a neces 
sary part of such a history i shall give a view of some of 
the principal controversies which have taken place with 
regard to each portion of knowledge 

an exposition and discussion of the fundamental 
ideas of each science may with great propriety be 
termed the philosophy of such science these ideas 
contain in themselves the elements of those truths 
which the science discovers and enunciates and in the 
progress of the sciences both in the world at large and in 
the mind of each individual student the most important 
steps consist in apprehending these ideas clearly and in 
bringing them into accordance with the observed facts 
i shall therefore in a series of books treat of the philo 
sophy of the pure sciences the philosophy of the mecha 
nical sciences the philosophy of chemistry and the like 
and shall analyse and examine the ideas which these 
sciences respectively involve 

in this undertaking inevitably somewhat long and 
involving many deep and subtle discussions i shall take 
as a chart of the country before me by which my course 
is to be guided the scheme of the sciences which i was 
led to form by travelling over the history of each in 
order each of the sciences of which i then narrated 
the progress depends upon several of the fundamental 
ideas of which i have to speak some of these ideas are 
peculiar to one field of speculation others are common to 
more a previous enumeration of ideas thus collected 
 history of the inductive sciences 



philosophy of sciences 

may serve both to show the course and limits of this part 
of our plan and the variety of interest which it offers 

i shall then successively have to speak of the ideas 
which are the foundation of geometry and arithmetic 
and which also regulate all sciences depending upon 
these as astronomy and mechanics namely the ideas 
of space time and number 

of the ideas on which the mechanical sciences as 
mechanics hydrostatics physical astronomy more pecu 
liarly rest the ideas of force and matter or rather the 
idea of cause which is the basis of these 

of the ideas which the secondary mechanical sciences 
acoustics optics and thermotics involve namely the 
ideas of the externality of objects and of the media by 
which we perceive their qualities 

of the ideas which are the basis of mechanicochemi 
cal and chemical science polarity chemical affinity and 
substance and the idea of symmetry a necessary part of 
the philosophy of crystallography 

of the ideas on which the classificatory sciences pro 
ceed mineralogy botany and zoology namely the ideas 
of resemblance arid of its gradations and of natural 
affinity 

finally of those ideas on which the physiological 
sciences are founded the ideas of separate vital powers 
such as assimilation and irritability and the idea of final 
cause 

we have besides these the palsetiological sciences 
which proceed mainly on the conception of historical 
causation 

it is plain that when we have proceeded so far as 
this we have advanced to the verge of those speculations 
which have to do with mind as well as body the 
extension of our philosophy to such a field if it can be 
justly so extended will be one of the most important 



 of ideas in general 

results of our researches but on that very account we 
must fully study the lessons which we learn in those 
fields of speculation where our doctrines are most secure 
before we venture into a region where our principles will 
appear to be more precarious and where they are inevi 
tably less precise 

we now proceed to the examination of the above 
ideas and to such essays towards the philosophy of each 
science as this course of investigation may suggest 



 



book ii 



the philosophy of the pure 
sciences 



chapter i 
of the pure sciences 

 all external objects and events which we can 
contemplate are viewed as having relations of space 
time and number and are subject to the general 
conditions which these ideas impose as well as to the 
particular laws which belong to each class of objects and 
occurrences the special laws of nature considered under 
the various aspects which constitute the different sciences 
are obtained by a mixed reference to experience and to 
the fundamental ideas of each science but besides the 
sciences thus formed by the aid of special experience the 
conditions which flow from those more comprehensive 
ideas first mentioned space time and number constitute 
a body of science applicable to objects and changes of 
all kinds and deduced without recurrence being had to 
any observation in particular these sciences thus 
unfolded out of ideas alone unmixed with any reference 
to the phenomena of matter are hence termed pure 
sciences the principal sciences of this class are geome 
try theoretical arithmetic and algebra considered in its 
most general sense as the investigation of the relations 
of space and number by means of general symbols 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

 these pure sciences were not included in our 
survey of the history of the sciences because they are 
not inductive sciences their progress has not consisted 
in collecting laws from phenomena true theories from 
observed facts and more general from more limited laws 
but in tracing the consequences of the ideas themselves 
and in detecting the most general and intimate analogies 
and connexions which prevail among such conceptions as 
are derivable from the ideas these sciences have no 
principles besides definitions and axioms and no process 
of proof but deduction this process however assuming 
here a most remarkable character and exhibiting a com 
bination of simplicity and complexity of rigour and 
generality quite unparalleled in other subjects 

 the universality of the truths and the rigour of 
the demonstrations of these pure sciences attracted 
attention in the earliest times and it was perceived that 
they offered an exercise and a discipline of the intellec 
tual faculties in a form peculiarly free from admixture 
of extraneous elements they were strenuously culti 
vated by the greeks both with a view to such a disci 
pline and from the love of speculative truth which pre 
vailed among that people and the name mafliematics by 
which they are designated indicates this their character 
of disciplined studies 

 as has already been said the ideas which these 
sciences involve extend to all the objects and changes 
which we observe in the external world and hence the 
consideration of mathematical relations forms a large 
portion of many of the sciences which treat of the phe 
nomena and laws of external nature as astronomy 
optics and mechanics such sciences are hence often 
termed mixed mathematics the relations of space and 
number being in these branches of knowledge combined 
with principles collected from special observation 



of the idea of space 

while geometry algebra and the like subjects which 
involve no result of experience are called pure mathe 
matics 

 space time and number may be conceived as 
forms by which the knowledge derived from our sensa 
tions is moulded and which are independent of the dif 
ferences in the matter of our knowledge arising from the 
sensations themselves hence the sciences which have 
these ideas for their subject may be termed formal 
sciences in this point of view they are distinguished 
from sciences in which besides these mere formal laws 
by which appearances are corrected we endeavour to 
apply to the phenomena the idea of cause or some of the 
other ideas which penetrate further into the principles 
of nature we have thus in the history distinguished 
formal astronomy and formal optics from physical 
astronomy and physical optics 

we now proceed to our examination of the ideas 
which constitute the foundation of these formal or pure 
mathematical sciences beginning with the idea of space 



chapter ii 
of the idea of space 

 by speaking of space as an idea i intend to imply 
as has already been stated that the apprehension of 
objects as existing in space and of the relations of posi 
tion c which thus prevail among them is not a conse 
quence of experience but a result of a peculiar constitu 
tion and activity of the mind which is independent of all 
experience in its origin though constantly combined with 
experience in its exercise 

that the idea of space is thus independent of experi 
ence has already been pointed out in speaking of ideas 

vol i g 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

in general but it may be useful to illustrate the doctrine 
further in this particular case 

i assert then that space is not a notion obtained 
by experience experience gives us information con 
cerning things without us but our apprehending them 
as without us takes for granted their existence in space 
experience acquaints us what are the form position 
magnitude of particular objects but that they have form 
position magnitude presupposes that they are in space 
we cannot derive from appearances by the way of 
observation the habit of representing things to ourselves 
as in space for no single act of observation is possible 
any otherwise than by beginning with such a representa 
tion and conceiving objects as already existing in space 

 that our mode of representing space to ourselves 
is not derived from experience is clear also from this 
that through this mode of representation we arrive at 
propositions which are rigorously universal and neces 
sary propositions of such a kind could not possibly be 
obtained from experience for experience can only teach 
us by a limited number of examples and therefore can 
never securely establish a universal proposition and 
again experience can only inform us that anything is so 
and can never prove that it must be so that two sides 
of a triangle are greater than the third is a universal and 
necessary geometrical truth it is true of all triangles 
it is true in such a way that the contrary cannot be con 
ceived experience could not prove such a proposition 
and experience has not proved it for perhaps no man 
ever made the trial as a means of removing doubts and 
no trial could in fact add in the smallest degree to the 
certainty of this truth to seek for proof of geometrical 
propositions by an appeal to observation proves nothing 
in reality except that the person who has recourse to such 
grounds has no due apprehension of the nature of geo 



of the idea of space 

metrical demonstration we have heard of persons who 
convinced themselves by measurement that the geome 
trical rule respecting the squares on the sides of a right 
angled triangle was true but these were persons whose 
minds had been engrossed by practical habits and in 
whom the speculative developement of the idea of space 
had been stifled by other employments the practical 
trial of the rule may illustrate but cannot prove it 
the rule will of course be confirmed by such trial because 
what is true in general is true in particular but it cannot 
be proved from any number of trials for no accumulation 
of particular cases makes up a universal case to all 
persons who can see the force of any proof the geome 
trical rule above referred to is as evident and its evidence 
as independent of experience as the assertion that sixteen 
and nine make twentyfive at the same time the truth 
of the geometrical rule is quite independent of numerical 
truths and results from the relations of space alone 
this could not be if our apprehension of the relations of 
space were the fruit of experience for experience has no 
element from which such truth and such proof could 
arise 

 thus the existence of necessary truths such as 
those of geometry proves that the idea of space from 
which they flow is not derived from experience such 
truths are inconceivable on the supposition of their being 
collected from observation for the impressions of sense 
include no evidence of necessity but we can readily 
understand the necessary character of such truths if we 
conceive that there are certain necessary conditions under 
which alone the mind receives the impressions of sense 
since these conditions reside in the constitution of the 
mind and apply to every perception of an object to which 
the mind can attain we easily see that their rules must 
include not only all that has been but all that can be 

g 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

matter of experience our sensations can each convey 
no information except about itself each can contain no 
trace of another additional sensation and thus no rela 
tion and connexion between two sensations can be given 
by the sensations themselves but the mode in which 
the mind perceives these impressions as objects may and 
will introduce necessary relations among them and thus 
by conceiving the idea of space to be a condition of per 
ception in the mind we can conceive the existence of 
necessary truths which apply to all perceived objects 

 if we consider the impressions of sense as the 
mere materials of our experience such materials may 
be accumulated in any quantity and in any order but 
if we suppose that this matter has a certain form given 
it in the act of being accepted by the mind we can 
understand how it is that these materials are subject to 
inevitable rules how nothing can be perceived exempt 
from the relations which belong to such a form and 
since there arc such truths applicable to our expe 
rience and arising from the nature of space we may 
thus consider space as a form which the materials given 
by experience necessarily assume in the mind as an 
arrangement derived from the perceiving mind and not 
from the sensations alone 

 thus this phrase that space is a form belonging 
to our perceptive power may be employed to express 
that we cannot perceive objects as in space without an 
operation of the mind as well as of the senses without 
active as well as passive faculties this phrase how 
ever is not necessary to the exposition of our doctrines 
whether we call the conception of space a condition of 
perception a form of perception or an idea or by any 
other term it is something originally inherent in the mind 
perceiving and not in the objects perceived and it is 
because the apprehension of all objects is thus subjected 



of the idea of space 

to certain mental conditions forms or ideas that our 
knowledge involves certain inviolable relations and neces 
sary truths the principles of such truths so far as they 
regard space are derived from the idea of space and we 
must endeavour to exhibit such principles in their general 
form but before we do this we may notice some of 
the conditions which belong not to our ideas in general 
but to this idea of space in particular 



chapter iii 

of some peculiarities of the idea of 
space 

 some of the ideas which we shall have to examine 
involve conceptions of certain relations of objects as the 
idea of cause and of likeness and may appear to be 
suggested by experience enabling us to abstract this 
general relation from particular cases but it will be 
seen that space is not such a general conception of a 
relation for we do not speak of spaces as we speak of 
causes and likenesses but of space and when we 
speak of spaces we understand by the expression parts 
of one and the same identical everywhere extended 
space we conceive a universal space which is not made 
up of these partial spaces as its component parts for it 
would remain if these were taken away and these 
cannot be conceived without presupposing absolute space 
absolute space is essentially one and the complication 
which exists in it and the conception of various spaces 
depends merely upon boundaries space must therefore 
be as we have said not a general conception abstracted 
from particulars but a universal mode of representation 
altogether independent of experience 

 space is infinite we represent it to ourselves ps 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

an infinitely great magnitude such an idea as that of 
likeness or cause is no doubt found in an infinite 
number of particular cases and so far includes these 
cases but these ideas do not include an infinite number 
of cases as parts of an infinite whole when we say 
that all bodies and partial spaces exist in infinite space 
we use an expression which is not applied in the same 
sense to any cases except those of space and time 

 what is here said may appear to be a denial of 
the real existence of space it must be observed how 
ever that we do not deny but distinctly assert the 
existence of space as a real and necessary condition of all 
objects perceived and that we not only allow that 
objects are seen external to us but we found upon the 
fact of their being so seen our view of the nature of 
space if however it be said that we deny the reality 
of space as an object or thing this is true nor does it 
appear easy to maintain that space exists as a thing 
when it is considered that this thing is infinite in all its 
dimensions and moreover that it is a thing which 
being nothing in itself exists only that other things may 
exist in it and those who maintain the real existence 
of space must also maintain the real existence of time in 
the same sense now two infinite things thus really 
existing and yet existing only as other things exist in 
them are notions so extravagant that we are driven to 
some other mode of explaining the state of the matter 

 thus space is not an object of which we perceive 
the properties but a form of our perception not a thing 
which affects our senses but an idea to which we con 
form the impressions of sense and its peculiarities 
appear to depend upon this that it is not only a form of 
sensation but of intuition that in reference to space 
we not only perceive but contemplate objects we see 
objects in space side by side exterior to each other 



peculiarities of the idea of space 

space and objects in so far as they occupy space have 
parts exterior to other parts and have the whole thus 
made up by the juxtaposition of parts this mode of 
apprehension belongs only to the ideas of space and 
time space and time are made up of parts but cause 
and likeness are not apprehended as made up of parts 
and the term intuition in its rigorous sense is appli 
cable only to that mode of contemplation in which we 
thus look at objects as made up of parts and apprehend 
the relations of those parts at the same time and by the 
same act by which we apprehend the objects themselves 

 as we have said space limited by boundaries 
gives rise to various conceptions which we have often to 
consider thus limited space assumes form or figure 
and the variety of conceptions thus brought under our 
notice is infinite we have every possible form of line 
straight line and curve and of curves an endless 
number circles parabolas hyperbolas spirals helices 
we have plane surfaces of various shapes parallelograms 
polygons ellipses and we have solid figures cubes 
cones cylinders spheres spheroids and so on all 
these have their various properties depending on the 
relations of their boundaries and the investigation of 
their properties forms the business of the science of 
geometry 

 space has three dimensions or directions in which 
it may be measured it cannot have more or fewer the 
simplest measurement is that of a straight line which 
has length alone a surface has both length and 
breadth and solid space has length breadth and thick 
ness or depth the origin of such a difference of dimen 
sions will be seen if we reflect that each portion of space 
has a boundary and is extended both in the direction in 
which its boundary extends and also in a direction from 
its boundary for otherwise it would not be a boundary 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

a point has no dimensions a line has but one dimen 
sion the distance from its boundary or its length a 
plane bounded by a straight line has the dimension 
which belongs to this line and also has another dimension 
arising from the distance of its parts from this boundary 
line and this may be called breadth a solid bounded 
by a plane has the dimensions which this plane has and 
has also a third dimension which we may call height or 
depth as we consider the solid extended above or below 
the plane or thickness if we omit all consideration of up 
and down and no space can have any dimensions 
which are not resoluble into these three 

we may now proceed to consider the mode in 
which the idea of space is employed in the formation 
of geometry 



chapter tv 

of the definitions and axioms which 
relate to space 

 the relations of space have been apprehended 
with peculiar distinctness and clearness from the very 
first unfolding of mans speculative powers this was a 
consequence of the circumstance which we have just 
noticed that the simplest of these relations and those on 
which the others depend are seen by intuition hence 
as soon as men were led to speculate concerning the 
relations of space they assumed just principles and 
obtained true results it is said that the science of 
geometry had its origin in egypt before the dawn of the 
greek philosophy but the knowledge of the early 
egyptians exclusive of their mythology appears to have 
been purely practical and probably their geometry 
consisted only in some maxims of landmeasuring which 



definitions and axioms relating to space 

is what the term implies the greeks of the time of 
plato had however not only possessed themselves of 
many of the most remarkable elementary theorems of 
the science but had in several instances reached the 
boundary of the science in its elementary form as when 
they proposed to themselves the problems of doubling 
the cube and squaring the circle 

but the deduction of these theorems by a systematic 
process and the primary exhibition of the simplest 
principles involved in the idea of space which such a 
deduction requires did not take place so far as we are 
aware till a period somewhat later the elements of 
geometry of euclid in which this task was performed are 
to this day the standard work on the subject the author 
of this work taught mathematics with great applause at 
alexandria in the reign of ptolemy lagus about 
years before christ the principles which euclid makes 
the basis of his system have been very little simplified 
since his time and all the essays and controversies 
which bear upon these principles have had a reference to 
the form in which they are stated by him 

 definitions the first principles of euclids geo 
metry are as the first principles of any system of geo 
metry must be definitions and axioms respecting the 
various ideal conceptions which he introduces as straight 
lines parallel lines angles circles and the like but it 
is to be observed that these definitions and axioms are 
very far from being arbitrary hypotheses and assumptions 
they have their origin in the idea of space and are 
merely modes of exhibiting that idea in such a manner 
as to make it afford grounds of deductive reasoning 
the axioms are necessary consequences of the concep 
tions respecting which they are asserted and the defi 
tions are no less necessary limitations of conceptions not 
requisite in order to arrive at this or that consequence 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

but necessary in order that it may be possible to draw any 
consequences and to establish any general truths 

for example if we rest the end of one straight 
staff upon the middle of another straight staff and move 
the first staff into various positions we by so doing 
alter the angles which the first staff makes with the 
other to the right hand and to the left but if we 
place the staff in that special position in which these two 
angles are equal each of them is a right angle according 
to euclid and this is the definition of a right angle 
except that euclid employs the abstract conception of 
straight lines instead of speaking as we have done of 
staves but this selection of the case in which the two 
angles are equal is not a mere act of caprice as it might 
have been if he had selected a case in which these angles 
are unequal in any proportion for the consequences 
which can be drawn concerning the cases of unequal 
angles do not lead to general truths without some refer 
ence to that peculiar case in which the angles are equal 
and thus it becomes necessary to single out and define 
that special case marking it by a special phrase and 
this definition not only gives complete and distinct know 
ledge what a right angle is to any one who can form the 
conception of an angle in general but also supplies a 
principle from which all the properties of right angles 
may be deduced 

 axioms with regard to other conceptions also as 
circles squares and the like it is possible to lay down 
definitions which are a sufficient basis for our reasoning 
so far as such figures are concerned but besides these 
definitions it has been found necessary to introduce 
certain axioms among the fundamental principles of geo 
metry these are of the simplest character for instance 
that two straight lines cannot cut each other in more than 
one point and an axiom concerning parallel lines like 



definitions and axioms relating to space 

the definitions these axioms flow from the idea of space 
and present that idea under various aspects they are 
different from the definitions nor can the definitions be 
made to take the place of the axioms in the reasoning by 
which elementary geometrical properties are established 
for example the definition of parallel straight lines is 
that they are such as however far continued can never 
meet but in order to reason concerning such lines we 
must further adopt some axiom respecting them for 
example we may very conveniently take this axiom that 
two straight lines which cut one another are not both of 
them parallel to a third straight line the definition 
and the axiom are seen to be inseparably connected by 
our intuition of the properties of space but the axiom 
cannot be proved from the definition by any rigorous 
deductive demonstration and if we were to take any 
other definition of two parallel straight lines as that 
they are both perpendicular to a third straight line we 
should still at some point or other of our progress fall in 
with the same difficulty of demonstratively establishing 
their properties without some further assumption 

 thus the elementary properties of figures which 
are the basis of our geometry are necessary results of our 
idea of space and are connected with each other by the 
nature of that idea and not merely by our hypotheses 
and constructions definitions and axioms must be com 
bined in order to express this idea so far as the purposes 
of demonstrative reasoning require these verbal enun 
ciations of the results of the idea cannot be made to 
depend on each other by logical consequence but have a 
mutual dependence of a more intimate kind which words 
cannot fully convey it is not possible to resolve these 
truths into certain hypotheses of which all the rest shall 
be the necessary logical consequence the necessity is 

 this axiom is simpler and more convenient than that of euclid 
it is employed by the late professor playfair in his geometry 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

not hypothetical but intuitive the axioms require not 
to be granted but to be seen if any one were to assent 
to them without seeing them to be true his assent would 
be of no avail for purposes of reasoning for he would be 
also unable to see in what cases they might be applied 
the clear possession of the idea of space is the first requi 
site for all geometrical reasoning and this clearness of 
idea may be tested by examining whether the axioms 
offer themselves to the mind as evident 

 the necessity of ideas added to sensations in order 
to produce knowledge has often been overlooked or 
denied in modern times the ground of necessary truth 
which ideas supply being thus lost it was conceived that 
there still remained a ground of necessity in definitions 
that we might have necessary truths by asserting especi 
ally what the definition implicitly involved in general it 
was held also that this was the case in geometry that 
all the properties of a circle for instance were implicitly 
contained in the definition of a circle that this alone is 
not the ground of the necessity of the truths which regard 
the circle that we could not in this way unfold a defini 
tion into proportions without possessing an intuition of 
the relations to which the definition led has already been 
shown but the insufficiency of the above account of the 
grounds of necessary geometrical truth appeared in ano 
ther way also it was found impossible to lay down a 
system of definitions out of which alone the whole of 
geometrical truth could be evolved it was found that 
axioms could not be superseded no definition of a 
straight line could be given which rendered the axiom 
concerning straight lines superfluous and thus it ap 
peared that the source of geometrical truths was not 
definition alone and we find in this result a confirmation 
of the doctrine which we are here urging that this source 
of truth is to be found in the form or conditions of our 
perception in the idea which we unavoidably combine 



definitions and axioms relating to space 

with the impressions of sense in the activity and not 
in the passivity of the mind 

 this will appear further when we come to con 
sider the mode in which we exercise our observation 
upon the relations of space but we may in the first 
place make a remark which tends to show the connexion 
between our conception of a straight line and the axiom 
which is made the foundation of our reasonings concern 
ing space the axiom is this that two straight lines 
which have both their ends joined cannot have the 
intervening parts separated so as to inclose a space 
the necessity of this axiom is of exactly the same 
kind as the necessity of the definition of a right angle 
of which we have already spoken for as the line 
standing on another makes right angles when it makes 
the angles on the two sides of it equal so a line is a 
straight line when it makes the two portions of space on 
the two sides of it similar and as there is only a single 
position of the line first mentioned which can make the 
angles equal so there is only a single form of a line which 
can make the spaces near the line similar on one side and 
on the other and therefore there cannot be two straight 
lines such as the axiom describes which between the 
same limits give two different boundaries to space thus 
separated and thus we see a reason for the axiom 
perhaps this view may be further elucidated if we take a 
leaf of paper double it and crease the folded edge we 
shall thus obtain a straight line at the folded edge and 
this line divides the surface of the paper as it was origi 
nally spread out into two similar spaces and that these 

 i formerly stated views similar to these in some remarks 
appended to a work which i termed the mechanical euclid pub 
lished in these remarks so far as they bear upon the question 
here discussed were noticed and controverted in no of the edin 
burgh review as an examination of the reviewers objections may 
serve further to illustrate the subject i shall annex to this chapter an 
answer to the article to which i have referred 



 philosophy op the pure sciences 

spaces are similar so far as the fold which separates them 
is concerned appears from this that these two parts 
coincide when the paper is doubled and thus a fold in 
a sheet of paper at the same time illustrates the defini 
tion of a straight line according to the above view and 
confirms the axiom that two such lines cannot enclose a 
space 

if the separation of the two parts of space were made 
by any other than a straight line if for instance the 
paper were cut by a concave line then on turning one of 
the parts over it is easy to see that the edge of one part 
being concave one way and the edge of the other part 
concave the other way these two lines might enclose a 
space and each of them would divide the whole space 
into two portions which were not similar for one portion 
would have a concave edge and the other a convex edge 
between any two points there might be innumerable lines 
drawn some convex one way arid some convex the other 
way but the straight line is the line which is not convex 
either one way or the other it is the single medium 
standard from which the others may deviate in opposite 
directions 

such considerations as these show sufficiently that 
the singleness of the straight line which connects any 
two points is a result of our fundamental conceptions of 
space but yet the above conceptions of the similar 
form of the two parts of space on the two sides of a line 
and of the form of a line which is intermediate among 
all other forms are of so vague a nature that they cannot 
fitly be made the basis of our elementary geometry and 
they are far more conveniently replaced as they have 
been in almost all treatises of geometry by the axiom 
that two straight lines cannot inclose a space 

 but we may remark that in what precedes we have 
considered space only under one of its aspects as a 
plane the sheet of paper which we assumed in order 



definitions and axioms relating to space 

to illustrate the nature of a straight line was supposed to 
be perfectly plane or flat for otherwise by folding it we 
might obtain a line not straight now this assumption 
of a plane appears to take for granted that very concep 
tion of a straight line which the sheet was employed to 
illustrate for the definition of a plane given in the ele 
ments of geometry is that it is a surface on which lie 
all straight lines drawn from one point of the surface to 
another arid thus the explanation above given of the 
nature of a straight line that it divides a plane space 
into similar portions on each side appears to be imper 
fect or nugatory 

and to this we reply that the explanation must be 
rendered complete and valid by deriving the conception 
of a plane from considerations of the same kind as those 
which we employed for a straight line any portion of 
solid space may be divided into two portions by surfaces 
passing through any given line or boundaries and these 
surfaces may be convex either on one side or on the 
other and they admit of innumerable changes from being 
convex on one side to being convex on the other in any 
degree so long as the surface is convex either way the 
two portions of space which it separates are not similar 
one having a convex and the other a concave boundary 
but there is a certain intermediate position of the sur 
face in which the two portions of space which it divides 
have their boundaries exactly similar in this position 
the surface is neither convex nor concave but plane 
and thus a plane surface is determined by this condition 
of its being that single surface which is the intermediate 
form among all convex and concave surfaces by which 
solid space can be divided and of its separating such 
space into two portions of which the boundaries though 
they are the same surface in two opposite positions are 
exactly similar 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

thus a plane is the simplest and most symmetrical 
boundary by which a solid can be divided and a straight 
line is the simplest and most symmetrical boundary by 
which a plane can be separated these conceptions are 
obtained by considering the boundaries of an interminable 
space capable of imaginary division in every direction 
and as a limited space may be separated into two parts 
by a plane and a plane again separated into two parts by 
a straight line so a line is divided into two portions by a 
point which is the common boundary of the two por 
tions the end of the one and the beginning of the other 
portion having itself no magnitude form or parts 

 the geometrical properties of planes and solids are 
deducible from the first principles of the elements with 
out any new axioms the definition of a plane above 
quoted that all straight lines joining its points lie in the 
plane being a sufficient basis for all reasoning upon these 
subjects and thus the views which we have presented 
of the nature of space being verbally expressed by means 
of certain definitions and axioms become the ground 
work of a long series of deductive reasoning by which 
is established a very large and curious collection of 
truths namely the whole science of elementary plane 
and solid geometry 

this science is one of indispensable use and constant 
reference to every student of the laws of nature for the 
relations of space and number are the alphabet in which 
those laws are written but besides the interest and im 
portance of this kind which geometry possesses it has a 
great and peculiar value for all who wish to understand 
the foundations of human knowledge and the methods 
by which it is acquired for the student of geometry 
acquires with a degree of insight and clearness which the 
unmathematical reader can but feebly imagine a convic 
tion that there are necessary truths many of them of a 



definitions and axioms relating to space 

very complex and striking character and that a few of 
the most simple and selfevident truths which it is pos 
sible for the mind of man to apprehend may by syste 
matic deduction lead to the most remote and unexpected 
results 

in pursuing such philosophical researches as that 
in which we are now engaged it is of great advantage 
to the speculator to have cultivated to some extent the 
study of geometry since by this study he may become 
fully aware of such features in human knowledge as 
those which we have mentioned by the aid of the 
lesson thus learned from the contemplation of geome 
trical truths we have been endeavouring to establish 
those further doctrines that these truths are but dif 
ferent aspects of the same fundamental idea and that the 
ground of the necessity which these truths possess reside 
in the idea from which they flow this idea not being a 
derivative result of experience but its primary rule 
when the reader has obtained a clear and satisfactory 
view of these doctrines so far as they are applicable to 
our knowledge concerning space he has we may trust 
overcome the main difficulty which will occur in follow 
ing the course of the speculations now presented to him 
he is then prepared to go forwards with us to see over 
how wide a field the same doctrines are applicable and 
how rich and various a harvest of knowledge springs 
from these seemingly scanty principles 

but before we quit the subject now under our con 
sideration we shall endeavour to answer some objections 
which have been made to the views here presented and 
shall attempt to illustrate further the active powers which 
we have ascribed to the mind 



vol i h

chapter v 

of some objections which have been 

made to the doctrines stated 

in the previous chapter 

the edinburgh review no cxxxv contains a 
critique on a work termed the mechanical euclid in which 
opinions were delivered to nearly the same effect as some 
of those stated in the last chapter and in chapter xi of 
the first book although i believe that there are no 
arguments used by the reviewer to which the answers will 
not suggest themselves in the mind of any one who has 
read with attention what has been said in the preceding 
chapters except perhaps one or two remarks which have 
reference to mechanical ideas it may serve to illustrate 
the subject if i reply to the objections directly taking 
them as the reviewer has stated them 

 i had dissented from stewarts assertion that mathe 
matical truth is hypothetical or depends upon arbitrary 
definitions since we understand by an hypothesis a 
supposition not only which we may make but may abstain 
from making or may replace by a different supposition 

 in order to render the present chapter more intelligible it may 
be proper to state briefly the arguments which gave occasion to the 
review after noticing stewarts assertions that the certainty of 
mathematical reasoning arises from its depending upon definitions and 
that mathematical truth is hypothetical i urged that no one has yet 
been able to construct a system of mathematical truths by the aid of 
definition alone that a definition would not be admissible or appli 
cable except it agreed with a distinct conception in the mind that the 
definitions which we employ in mathematics are not arbitrary or hypo 
thetical lut necessary definitions that if stewart had taken as his 
examples of axioms the peculiar geometrical axioms his assertions 
would have been obviously erroneous and that the real foundation of 
the truths of mathematics is the idea of space which may be ex 
pressed for purposes of demonstration partly by definitions and 
partly by axioms 



answer to objections 

whereas the definitions and hypotheses of geometry are 
necessarily such as they are and cannot be altered or 
excluded the reviewer p informs us that he under 
stands stewart when he speaks of hypotheses and defini 
tions being the foundation of geometry to speak of the 
hypothesis that real objects correspond to our geometrical 
definitions if a crystal be an exact hexahedron the 
geometrical properties of the hexahedron may be predi 
cated of that crystal to this i reply that such hypo 
theses as this are the grounds of our applications of geo 
metrical truths to real objects but can in no way be said 
to be the foundation of the truths themselves that i do 
not think that the sense which the reviewer gives was 
stewarts meaning but that if it was this view of the 
use of mathematics does not at all affect the question 
which both he and i proposed to discuss which was 
the ground of mathematical certainty i may add that 
whether a crystal be an exact hexahedron is a matter of 
observation and measurement not of definition i think 
the reader can have no difficulty in seeing how little my 
doctrine is affected by the connexion on which the re 
viewer thus insists i have asserted that the proposition 
which affirms the square on the diagonal of a rectangle to 
be equal to the squares on two sides does not rest upon 
arbitrary hypotheses the objector answers that the pro 
position that the square on the diagonal of this page is 
equal to the squares on the sides depends upon the arbi 
trary hypothesis that the page is a rectangle even if 
this fact were a matter of arbitrary hypothesis what 
could it have to do with the general geometrical pro 
position how could a single fact observed or hypo 
thetical affect a universal and necessary truth which 
would be equally true if the fact were false if there 
be nothing arbitrary or hypothetical in geometry till we 
come to such steps in its application it is plain that the 

h 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

truths themselves are not hypothetical which is the 
question for us to decide 

 the reviewer then p considers the doctrine 
that axioms as well as definitions are the foundations of 
geometry and here he strangely narrows and confuses 
the discussion by making himself the advocate of stewart 
instead of arguing the question itself i had asserted 
that some axioms are necessary as the foundations of 
mathematical reasoning in addition to the definitions 
if stewart did not intend to discuss this question i had 
no concern with what he had said about axioms but i 
had every reason to believe that this was the question 
which stewart did intend to discuss i conceive there is 
no doubt that he intended to give an opinion upon the 
grounds of mathematical reasoning in general for he 
begins his discussion elements vol ii p by contesting 
reids opinion on this subject which is stated generally 
and he refers again to the same subject asserting in 
general terms that the first principles of mathematics are 
not axioms but definitions if then afterwards he made 
his proof narrower than his assertion if having declared 
that no axioms are necessary he afterwards limited him 
self to showing that seven out of twelve of euclids 
axioms are barren truisms it was no concern of mine to 
contest this assertion which left my thesis untouched 
i had asserted that the proper geometrical axioms that 
two straight lines cannot inclose a space and the axiom 
about parallel lines are indispensable in geometry 
what account the reviewer gives of these axioms we 
shall soon see but if stewart allowed them to be axioms 
necessary to geometrical reasoning he overturned his 
own assertion as to the foundations of such reasoning 
and if he said nothing decisive about these axioms 
which are the points on which the battle must turn he 
left his assertion altogether unproved nor was it neces 



answer to objections 

sary for me to pursue the war into a barren and unim 
portant corner when the metropolis was surrendered 
the reviewers exultation that i have not contested the 
first seven axioms is an amusing example of the self 
complacent zeal of advocacy 

 but let us turn to the material point the proper 
geometrical axioms what is the reviewers account of 
these which side of the alternative does he adopt 
do they depend upon the definitions and is he prepared 
to show the dependence or are they superfluous and 
can he erect the structure of geometry without their aid 
one of these two courses it would seem he must take 
for we both begin by asserting the excellence of geometry 
as an example of demonstrated truth it is precisely 
this attribute which gives an interest to our present in 
quiry how then does the reviewer explain this excel 
lence on his views how does he reckon the foundation 
courses of the edifice which we agree in considering as a 
perfect example of intellectual building 

i presume i may take as his answer to this question 
his hypothetical statement of what stewart would have 
said p on the supposition that there had been among 
the foundations of geometry selfevident indemonstrable 
truths although it is certainly strange that the reviewer 
should not venture to make up his mind as to the truth or 
falsehood of this supposition if there were such truths 
they would be he says legitimate filiations of the defi 
nitions they would be involved in the definitions 
and again he speaks of the foundation of the geo 
metrical doctrine of parallels as a flaw and as a truth 
which requires but has not received demonstration 
and yet again he tells us that each of these supposed 
axioms euclids twelfth for instance is merely an 
indication of the point at which geometry fails to perform 
that which it undertakes to perform p and 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

that in reality her truths are not yet demonstrated the 
amount of this is that the geometrical axioms are to be 
held to be legitimate filiations of the definitions because 
though certainly true they cannot be proved from the 
definitions that they are involved in the definitions 
although they cannot be evolved out of them and that 
rather than admit that they have any other origin than 
the definitions we are to proclaim that geometry has 
failed to perform what she undertakes to perform 

to this i reply that i cannot understand what is meant 
by legitimate filiations of principles if the phrase do 
not mean consequences of such principles established by 
rigorous and formal demonstration that the reviewer if 
he claims any real signification for his phrase must sub 
stantiate the meaning of it by such a demonstration 
he must establish his legitimate filiation by a genea 
logical table in a satisfactory form when this cannot 
be done to assert notwithstanding that the propositions 
are involved in the definitions is a mere begging the 
question and to excuse this defect by saying that geo 
metry fails to perform what she has promised is to calum 
niate the character of that science which we profess to 
make our standard rather than abandon an arbitrary 
and unproved assertion respecting the real grounds of her 
excellence i add further that if the doctrine of parallel 
lines or any other geometrical doctrine of which we see 
the truth with the most perfect insight of its necessity 
have not hitherto received demonstration to the satisfac 
tion of any school of reasoners the defect must arise 
from their erroneous views of the nature of demonstra 
tions and the grounds of mathematical certainty 

 i conceive then that the reviewer has failed alto 
gether to disprove the doctrine that the axioms of geo 
metry are necessary as a part of the foundations of the 
science i had asserted further that these axioms supply 



answer to objections 

what the definitions leave deficient and that they along 
with definitions serve to present the idea of space under 
such aspects that we can reason logically concerning it 
to this the reviewer opposes p the common opinion 
that a perfect definition is a complete explanation of a 
name and that the test of its perfection is that we 
may substitute the definition for the name wherever it 
occurs i reply that my doctrine that a definition ex 
presses a part but not the whole of the essential cha 
racters of an idea is certainly at variance with an opinion 
sometimes maintained that a definition merely explains 
a word and should explain it so fully that it may always 
replace it the error of this common opinion may i think 
be shown from considerations such as these that if we 
undertake to explain one word by several we may be called 
upon on the same ground to explain each of these seve 
ral by others and that in this way we can reach no limit 
nor restingplace that in point of fact it is not found to 
lead to clearness but to obscurity when in the discussion 
of general principles we thus substitute definitions for 
single terms that even if this be done we cannot reason 
without conceiving what the terms mean and that in 
doing this the relations of our conceptions and not the 
arbitrary equivalence of two forms of expression are the 
foundations of our reasoning 

 the reviewer conceives that some of the socalled 
axioms are really definitions the axiom that magni 
tudes which coincide with each other that is which fill 
the same space are equal is a definition of geometrical 
equality the axiom that the whole is greater than its 
part is a definition of whole and part but surely there 
are very serious objections to this view it would seem 
more natural to say if the former axiom is a definition 
of the word equal that the latter is a definition of the 
word greater and how can one short phrase define two 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

terms if i say the heat of summer is greater than 
the heat of winter does this assertion define anything 
though the proposition is perfectly intelligible and dis 
tinct i think then that this attempt to reduce these 
axioms to definitions is quite untenable 

 i have stated that a definition can be of no use 
except we can conceive the possibility and truth of the 
property connected with it and that if we do conceive 
this we may rightly begin our reasonings by stating the 
property as an axiom which euclid does in the case of 
straight lines and of parallels the reviewer inquires 
p whether i am prepared to extend this doctrine to 
the case of circles for which the reasoning is usually rested 
upon the definition whether i would replace this defini 
tion by an axiom asserting the possibility of such a circle 
to this i might reply that it is not at all incumbent 
upon me to assent to such a change for i have all along 
stated that it is indifferent whether the fundamental pro 
perties from which we reason be exhibited as definitions 
or as axioms provided their necessity be clearly seen 
but i am ready to declare that i think the form of our 
geometry w t ould be not at all the worse if instead of the 
usual definition of a circle that it is a figure contained 
by one line which is called the circumference and which 
is such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point 
within the circumference are equal to one another 
we were to substitute an axiom and a definition as 
follows 

axiom if a line be drawn so as to be at every point 
equally distant from a certain point this line will return 
into itself or will be one line including a space 

definitions the space is called a circle the line the 
circumference and the point the centre 

and this being done it would be true as the reviewer 
remarks that geometry cannot stir one step without 



answer to objections 

resting on an axiom and i do not at all hesitate to say 
that the above axiom expressed or understood is no less 
necessary than the definition and is tacitly assumed in 
every proposition into which circles enter 

 i have i think now disposed of the principal 
objections which bear upon the proper axioms of geo 
metry the principles which are stated as the first seven 
axioms of euclids elements need not as i have said be 
here discussed they are principles which refer not to 
space in particular but to quantity in general such 
for instance as these if equals be added to equals the 
wholes are equal if equals be taken from equals the 
remainders are equal but i will make an observation 
or two upon them before i proceed 

both locke and stewart have spoken of these axioms 
as barren truisms as propositions from which it is not 
possible to deduce a single inference and the reviewer 
asserts that they are not first principles but laws of 
thought p to this last expression i am willing 
to assent but i would add that not only these but all 
the principles which express the fundamental conditions 
of our knowledge may with equal propriety be termed 
laws of thought for these principles depend upon our 
ideas and regulate the active operations of the mind by 
which coherence and connexion are given to its passive 
impressions but the assertion that no conclusions can 
be drawn from simple axioms or laws of human thought 
which regard quantity is by no means true the whole 
of arithmetic for instance the rules for the multiplica 
tion and division of large numbers for finding a common 
measure and in short a vast body of theory respecting 
numbers rests upon no other foundation than such 
axioms as have been just noticed that if equals be added 
to equals the wholes will be equal and even when 
lockes assertion that from these axioms no truths can 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

be deduced is modified by stewart and the reviewer and 
limited to geometrical truths it is hardly tenable although 
in fact it matters little to our argument whether it is 
or no for the greater part of the seventh book of 
euclids elements on commensurable and incommen 
surable quantities and the fifth book on proportion 
depend upon these axioms with the addition only of the 
definition or axiom for it may be stated either way 
which expresses the idea of proportionality in numbers 
so that the attempt to disprove the necessity and use of 
axioms as principles of reasoning fails even when we 
take those instances which the opponents consider as the 
more manifestly favourable to their doctrine 

 but perhaps the question may have already sug 
gested itself to the readers mind of what use can it be 
formally to state such principles as these for example 
that if equals be added to equals the wholes are equal 
since whether stated or no they will be assumed in our 
reasoning and how can such principles be said to be 
necessary when our proof proceeds equally well without 
any reference to them and the answer is that it is 
precisely because these are the common principles of 
reasoning which we naturally employ without specially 
contemplating them that they require to be separated 
from the other steps and formally stated when we 
analyse the demonstrations which we have obtained 
in every mental process many principles are combined 
and abbreviated and thus in some measure concealed 
and obscured in analysing these processes the combi 
nation must be resolved and the abbreviation expanded 
and thus the appearance is presented of a pedantic and 
superfluous formality but that which is superfluous for 
proof is necessary for the analysis of proof in order to 
exhibit the conditions of demonstration distinctly they 
must be exhibited formally in the same manner in 



answer to objections 

demonstration we do not usually express every step in 
the form of a syllogism but we see the grounds of the 
conclusiveness of a demonstration by resolving it into 
syllogisms neither axioms nor syllogisms are necessary 
for conviction but they are necessary to display the con 
ditions under which conviction becomes inevitable the 
application of a single one of the axioms just spoken of 
is so minute a step in the proof that it appears pedantic 
to give it a marked place but the very essence of 
demonstration consists in this that it is composed of an 
indissoluble succession of such minute steps the admi 
rable circumstance is that by the accumulation of such 
apparently imperceptible advances we can in the end 
make so vast and so sure a progress the completeness 
of the analysis of our knowledge appears in the small 
ness of the elements into which it is thus resolved the 
minuteness of any of these elements of truth of axioms 
for instance does not prevent their being as essential as 
others which are more obvious and any attempt to 
assume one kind of element only when the course of our 
analysis brings before us two or more kinds is alto 
gether unphilosophical axioms and definitions are the 
proximate constituent principles of our demonstrations 
and the intimate bond which connects together a defini 
tion and an axiom on the same subject is not truly 
expressed by asserting the latter to be derived from the 
former this bond of connexion exists in the mind of 
the reasoner in his conception of that to which both defi 
nition and axiom refer and consequently in the general 
fundamental idea of which that conception is a modifi 
cation

chapter vi 
of the perception of space 

 according to the views above explained certain of 
the impressions of our senses convey to us the perception 
of objects as existing in space inasmuch as by the con 
stitution of our minds we cannot receive those impres 
sions otherwise than in a certain form involving such a 
manner of existence but the question deserves to be 
asked what are the impressions of sense by which we 
thus become acquainted with space and its relations 
and as we have seen that this idea of space implies an 
act of the mind as well as an impression on the sense 
what manifestations do we find of this activity in our 
observation of the external world 

it is evident that sight and touch are the senses by 
which the relations of space are perceived principally or 
entirely it does not appear that an odour or a feeling 
of warmth or cold would independently of experience 
suggest to us the conception of a space surrounding us 
but when we see objects we see that they are extended 
and occupy space when we touch them we feel that 
they are in a space in which we also are we have 
before our eyes any object for instance a board covered 
with geometrical diagrams and we distinctly perceive 
by vision those lines of which the relations are the sub 
jects of our mathematical reasoning again we see 
before us a solid object a cubical box for instance we 
see that it is within reach we stretch out the hand and 
perceive by the touch that it has sides edges corners 
which we had already perceived by vision 

 probably most persons do not generally apprehend 
that there is any material difference in these two cases 



of the perception of space 

that there are any different acts of mind concerned in 
perceiving by sight a mathematical diagram upon paper 
and a solid cube lying on a table yet it is not difficult 
to show that in the latter case at least the perception of 
the shape of the object is not immediate a very little 
attention teaches us that there is an act of judgment as 
well as a mere impression of sense requisite in order that 
we may see any solid object for there is no visible 
appearance which is inseparably connected with solidity 
if a picture of a cube be rightly drawn in perspective and 
skilfully shaded the impression upon the sense is the same 
as if it were a real cube the picture may be mistaken for 
a solid object but it is clear that in this case the solidity 
is given to the object by an act of mental judgment 
all that is seen is outline and shade figures and colours 
on a flat board the solid angles and edges the relation 
of the faces of the figure by which they form a cube is a 
matter of inference this which is evident in the case 
of the pictured cube is true in all vision whatever we 
see a scene before us on which are various figures and 
colours but the eye cannot see more it sees length 
and breadth but no third dimension in order to know 
that there are solids we must infer as well as see and 
this we do readily and constantly so familiarly indeed 
that we do not perceive the operation yet we may detect 
this latent process in many ways for instance by attending 
to cases in which the habit of drawing such inferences 
misleads us most persons have experienced this delu 
sion in looking at a scene in a theatre and especially 
that kind of scene which is called a diorama when 
the interior of a building is represented in these 
cases the perspective representations of the various 
members of the architecture and decoration impress us 
almost irresistibly with the conviction that we have 
before us a space of great extent and complex form 
instead of a flat painted canvass here at least the 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

space is our own creation but it is manifestly created 
by the same act of thought as if we were really in the 
palace or the cathedral of which the halls and aisles thus 
seem to inclose us and the act by which we thus 
create space of three dimensions out of visible extent 
of length and breadth is constantly and imperceptibly 
going on we are perpetually interpreting in this 
manner the language of the visible world from the 
appearances of things which we directly see we are con 
stantly inferring that which we cannot directly see their 
distance from us and the position of their parts 

 the characters which we thus interpret are various 
they are for instance the visible forms colours and 
shades of their parts understood according to the maxims 
of perspective for of perspective every one has a prac 
tical knowledge as every one has of grammar the 
effort by which we fix both our eyes on the same object 
and adjust each eye to distinct vision and the like 
the right interpretation of the information which such 
circumstances give us respecting the true forms and 
distances of things is gradually learned the lesson being 
begun in our earliest infancy and inculcated upon us 
every hour during which we use our eyes the com 
pleteness with which the lesson is mastered is truly 
admirable for we forget that our conclusion is obtained 
indirectly and mistake a judgment on evidence for an 
intuitive perception we see the breadth of the street 
as clearly and readily as we see the house on the other 
side of it and we see the house to be square however 
obliquely it be presented to us this however by no 
means throws any doubt or difficulty on the doctrine 
that in all these cases we do interpret and infer the 
rapidity of the process and the unconsciousness of the 
effort are not more remarkable in this case than they are 
when we understand the meaning of the speech which 
we hear or of the book which we read in these latter 



of the perception of space ill 

cases we merely hear noises or see black marks but we 
make out of these elements thought and feeling without 
being aware of the act by which we do so and by an 
exactly similar process we see a variouslycoloured 
expanse and collect from it a space occupied by solid 
objects in both cases the act of interpretation is become 
so habitual that we can hardly stop short at the mere 
impression of sense 

 but yet there are various ways in which we may 
satisfy ourselves that these two parts of the process of 
seeing objects are distinct to separate these operations 
is precisely the task which the artist has to execute in 
making a drawing of what he sees he has to recover 
the consciousness of his real and genuine senations and 
to discern the lines of objects as they appear this at 
first he finds difficult for he is tempted to draw what 
he knows of the forms of visible objects and not what 
he sees but as he improves in his art he learns to put 
on paper what he sees only separate from what he infers 
in order that thus the inference and with it a conception 
like that of the reality may be left to the spectator and 
thus the natural process of vision is the habit of seeing 
that which cannot be seen and the difficulty of the art 
of drawing consists in not seeing more than is visible 

 but again even in the simplest drawing we 
exhibit something which we do not see however slight 
is our representation of objects it contains something 
which we create for ourselves for we draw an outline 
now an outline has no existence in nature there are 
no visible lines presented to the eye by a group of figures 
we separate each figure from the rest and the boundary 
by which we do this is the outline of the figure and the 
like may be said of each member of every figure a painter 
of our own times has made this remark in a work upon his 
art the effect which natural objects produce upon our 

 phillips on painting 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

sense of vision is that of a number of parts or distinct 
masses of form and colour and not of lines but when 
we endeavour to represent by painting the objects which 
are before us or which invention supplies to our minds 
the first and the simplest means we resort to is this 
picture by which we separate the form of each object 
from those that surround it marking its boundary the 
extreme extent of its dimensions in every direction as 
impressed on our vision and this is termed drawing its 
outline 

 again there are other ways in which we see clear 
manifestations of the act of thought by which we assign 
to the parts of objects their relations in space the 
impressions of sense being merely subservient to this 
act if we look at a medal through a glass which 
inverts it we see the figures upon it become concave 
depressions instead of projecting convexities for the 
light which illuminates the nearer side of the convexity 
will be transferred to the opposite side by the apparent 
inversion of the medal and will thus imply a hollow 
in which the side nearest the light gathers the shade 
here our decision as to which part is nearest to us has 
reference to the side from vhich the light comes in 
other cases it is more spontaneous if we draw black 
outlines such as represent the edges of a cube seen 
in perspective certain of the lines will cross each other 
and we may make tins cube appear to assume two 
different positions by determining that the lines which 
belong to one end of the cube shall be understood to be 
before or to be behind those which they cross here an 
act of the will operating upon the same sensible image 
gives us two cubes occupying two entirely different 
positions again many persons may have observed that 
when a windmill in motion at a distance from us so 
that the outline of the sails only is seen stands obliquely 
to the eye we may by an effort of thought make the 



of the perception of space 

obliquity assume one or the other of two positions and 
as we do this the sails which in one instance appear to 
turn from right to left in the other case turn from left 
to right a person a little familiar with this mental 
effort can invert the motion as often as he pleases so 
long as the conditions of form and light do not offer a 
manifest contradiction to either position 

thus we have these abundant and various manifesta 
tions of the activity of the mind in the process by which 
we collect from vision the relations of solid space of three 
dimensions but we must further make some remarks on 
the process by which we perceive mere visible figure 
and also on the mode in which we perceive the relations 
of space by the touch and first of the latter subject 

 the opinion above illustrated that our sight 
does not give us a direct knowledge of the relations of 
solid space and that this knowledge is acquired only by 
an inference of the mind was first clearly taught by the 
celebrated bishop berkeley and is a doctrine now gene 
rally assented to by metaphysical speculators 

but does the sense of touch give us directly a know 
ledge of space this is a question which has attracted 
considerable notice in recent times and new light has 
been thrown upon it in a degree which is very remark 
able when we consider that the philosophy of perception 
has been a prominent subject of inquiry from the earliest 
times two philosophers advancing to this inquiry 
from different sides the one a metaphysician the other a 
physiologist have independently arrived at the conviction 
that the long current opinion according to which we 
acquire a knowledge of space by the sense of touch is 
erroneous and the doctrine which they teach instead 
of the ancient error has a very important bearing upon 
the principle which we are endeavouring to establish 

 theory of vision 
vol i i 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

that our knowledge of space and its properties is derived 
rather from the active operations than from the passive 
impressions of the percipient mind 

undoubtedly the persuasion that we acquire a know 
ledge of form by the touch is very obviously suggested 
by our common habits if we wish to know the form of 
any body in the dark or to correct the impressions 
conveyed by sight when we suspect them to be false we 
have only it seems to us at least at first to stretch forth 
the hand and touch the object and we learn its shape 
with no chance of error in these cases form appears 
to be as immediate a perception of the sense of touch as 
colour is of the sense of sight 

 but is this perception really the result of the 
passive sense of touch merely against such an opinion 
dr brown the metaphysician of whom i speak urges 
that the feeling of touch alone when any object is applied 
to the hand or any other part of the body can no more 
convey the conception of form or extension than the 
sensation of an odour or a taste can do except we have 
already some knowledge of the relative position of the 
parts of our bodies that is except we are already in 
possession of an idea of space and have in our minds 
referred our limbs to their positions which is to suppose 
the conception of form already acquired 

 by what faculty then do we originally acquire onr 
conceptions of the relations of position brown answers 
by the muscular sense that is the conscious exertions 
of the various muscles by which we move our limbs 
when we feel out the form and position of bodies by 
the hand our knowledge is acquired not by the mere 
touch of the body but by perceiving the course the 
fingers must take in order to follow the surface of the 
body or to pass from one body to another we are 

 lecturer vol i p j 



of the perception of space 

conscious of the slightest of the volitions by which we 
thus feel out form and place we know whether we move 
the finger to the right or left up or down to us or from 
us through a large or a small space and all these con 
scious acts are bound together and regulated in our minds 
by an idea of an extended space in which they are per 
formed that this idea of space is not borrowed from the 
sight and transferred to the muscular feelings by habit 
is evident for a man born blind can feel out his way 
with his staff and has his conceptions of position deter 
mined by the conditions of space no less than one who 
has the use of his eyes and the muscular consciousness 
which reveals to us the position of objects and parts of 
objects when we feel them out by means of the hand 
shews itself in a thousand other ways and in all our 
limbs for our habits of standing walking and all other 
attitudes and motions are regulated by our feeling 
of our position and that of surrounding objects and 
thus we cannot touch any object without learning some 
thing respecting its position not that the sense of touch 
directly conveys such knowledge but we have already 
learnt from the muscular sense constantly exercised the 
position of the limb which the object thus touches 

 the justice of this distinction will i think be 
assented to by all persons who attend steadily to the 
process itself and might be maintained by many forcible 
reasons perhaps one of the most striking evidences in 
its favour is that as i have already intimated it is the 
opinion to which another distinguished philosopher sir 
charles bell has been led reasoning entirely upon phy 
siological principles from his researches it resulted that 
besides the nerves which convey the impulse of the will 
from the brain to the muscle by which every motion of 
our limbs is produced there is another set of nerves which 
carry back to the brain a sense of the condition of the 

i 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

muscle and thus regulate its activity and give us the 
consciousness of our position and relation to surrounding 
objects the motion of the hand and fingers or the con 
sciousness of this motion must be combined with the 
sense of touch properly so called in order to make an 
inlet to the knowledge of such relations this conscious 
ness of muscular exertion which he called a sixth sense 
is our guide sir c bell shows in the common practical 
government of our motions and he states that having 
given this explanation of perception as a physiological 
doctrine he had with satisfaction seen it confirmed by 
dr browns speculations 

 thus it appears that our consciousness of the re 
lations of space is inseparably and fundamentally con 
nected with our own actions in space we perceive only 
while we act our sensations require to be interpreted by 
our volitions the apprehension of extension and figure 
is far from being a process in which we are inert and 
passive we draw lines with our fingers we construct 
surfaces by curving our hands we generate spaces by the 
motion of our arms when the geometer bids us form 
lines or surfaces or solids by motion he intends his in 
junction to be taken as hypothetical only we need only 
conceive such motions but yet this hypothesis repre 
sents truly the origin of our knowledge we perceive by 
motion at first as we conceive afterwards or if not 
always by actual motion at least by potential if we 
perceive the length of a staff by holding its two ends in 
our two hands without running the finger along it this is 
because by habitual motion we have already acquired a 
measure of the distance of our hands in any attitude of 
which we are conscious even in the simplest case our 
perceptions are derived not from the touch but from the 

 bridgewater treatise p phil trans p ii 
p 



of the perception of space 

sixth sense and this sixth sense at least whatever may 
be the case with the other five implies an active mind 
along with the passive sense 

 upon attentive consideration it will be clear that 
a large portion of the perceptions respecting space which 
appear at first to be obtained by sight alone are in fact 
acquired by means of this sixth sense thus we consider 
the visible sky as a single surface surrounding us and re 
turning into itself and thus forming a hemisphere but 
such a mode of conceiving an object of vision could never 
have occurred to us if we had not been able to turn our 
heads to follow this surface to pursue it till we find it re 
turning into itself and when we have done this we 
necessarily represent it to ourselves as a concave inclosure 
within which we are the sense of sight alone without 
the power of muscular motion could not have jed us to 
view the sky as a vault or hemisphere under such cir 
cumstances we should have perceived only what was pre 
sented to the eye in one position and if different 
appearances had been presented in succession we could 
not have connected them as parts of the same picture 
for want of any perception of their relative position 
they would have been so many detached and incohe 
rent visual sensations the muscular sense connects 
their parts into a whole making them to be only different 
portions of one universal scene 

 these considerations point out the fallacy of a very 
curious representation made by dr reid of the convic 
tions to which man would be led if he possessed vision 
without the sense of touch to illustrate this subject 
reid uses the fiction of a nation whom he terms the ido 
menians who have no sense except that of sight he 
describes their notions of the relations of space as being 
entirely different from ours the axioms of their geome 
try are quite contradictory to our axioms for example 



 philosophy op the pure sciences 

it is lield to be selfevident among them that two straight 
lines which intersect each other once must intersect a 
second time that the three angles of any triangle are 
greater than two right angles and the like these para 
doxes are obtained by tracing the relations of lines on the 
surface of a concave sphere which surrounds the spec 
tator and on which all visible appearances may be sup 
posed to be presented to him but from what is said 
above it appears that the notion of such a sphere and 
such a connexion of visible objects which are seen in dif 
ferent directions cannot be arrived at by sight alone 
when the spectator combines in his conception the rela 
tions of longdrawn lines and large figures as he sees 
them by turning his head to the right and to the left up 
wards and downwards he ceases to be an idomenian 
and thus our conceptions of the properties of space de 
rived through the exercise of one mode of perception are 
not at variance with those obtained in another way but 
all such conceptions however produced or suggested are 
in harmony with each other being as has already been 
said only different aspects of the same idea 

 if our perceptions of the position of objects 
around us do not depend on the sense of vision alone but 
on the muscular feeling brought into play when we turn 
our head it will obviously follow that the same is true 
when we turn the eye instead of the head and thus 
we may learn the form of objects not by looking at 
them with a fixed gaze but by following the boundary of 
them with the eye while the head is held perfectly 
still the eye can rove along the outlines of visible objects 
scrutinize each point in succession and leap from one 
point to another each such act being accompanied by a 
muscular consciousness which makes us aware of the 
direction in which the look is travelling and we may 
thus gather information concerning the figures and places 



of the perception of space 

which we trace out with the visual ray as the blind 
man learns the forms of things which he traces out with 
his staff being conscious of the motions of his hand 

 this view of the mode in which the eye per 
ceives position which is thus supported by the analogy 
of other members employed for the same purpose is fur 
ther confirmed by sir charles bell by physiological rea 
sons he teaches us that when an object is seen we 
employ two senses there is an impression on the retina 
but we receive also the idea of position or relation in 
space which it is not the office of the retina to give by 
our consciousness of the efforts of the voluntary muscles 
of the eye and he has traced in detail the course of the 
nerves by which these muscles convey their information 
the constant searching motion of the eye as he terms itf 
is the means by which we become aware of the position 
of objects about us 

 it is not to our present purpose to follow the 
physiology of this subject but we may notice that sir 
c bell has examined the special circumstances which 
belong to this operation of the eye we learn from him 
that the particular point of the eye which thus traces the 
forms of visible objects is a part of the retina which has 
been termed the sensible spot being that part which is 
most sensible to the impressions of light and colour this 
part indeed is not a spot of definite size and form for it 
appears that proceeding from a certain point of the retina 
the sensibility diminishes on every side by degrees and 
the searching motion of the eye arises from the desire 
which we instinctively feel of receiving upon the sensible 
spot the image of the object to which the attention is 
directed we are uneasy and impatient till the eye is 
turned so that this is effected and as our attention is 

 p idl trans on the motions of the eye 
t bridget aler treatise p 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

transferred from point to point of the scene before us the 
eye and this point of the eye in particular travel along 
with the thoughts and the muscular sense which tells 
us of these movements of the organ of vision conveys 
to us a knowledge of the forms and places which we thus 
successively survey 

 how much of activity there is in the process by 
which we perceive the outlines of objects appears further 
from the language by which we describe their forms 
we apply to them not merely adjectives of form but 
verbs of motion an abrupt hill starts out of the plain 
a beautiful figure has a gliding outline we have 

the windy summit wild and high 
roughly rushing on the sky 

these terms express the course of the eye as it follows 
the lines by which such forms are bounded and marked 
in like manner another modern poet says of soracte 

that il from out the plain 

heaves like a longswept wave about to break 
and on the curl hangs pausing 

thus the muscular sense which is inseparably con 
nected with an act originating in our own mind not only 
gives us all that portion of our perceptions of space in 
which we use the sense of touch but also at least in a 
great measure another large portion of such perceptions 
in which we employ the sense of sight as we have 
before seen that our knowledge of solid space and its 
properties is not conceivable in any other way than as the 
result of a mental act governed by conditions depending 
on its own nature so it now appears that our perceptions 
of visible figure are not obtained without an act performed 
under the same conditions the sensations of touch and 
sight are subordinated to an idea which is the basis of 
our speculative knowledge concerning space and its rela 

 byron ch ear iv st 



of the perception of space 

tions and this same idea is disclosed to our conscious 
ness by its practically regulating our intercourse with the 
external world 

by considerations such as have been adduced and 
referred to it is proved beyond doubt that in a great 
number of cases our knowledge of form and position is 
acquired from the muscular sense and not from sight 
directly for instance in all cases in which we have 
before us large objects and extensive spaces whether 
in any case the eye gives us a direct perception of form 
we shall not here further inquire another opportunity 
of discussing this subject will occur hereafter 

we now quit the consideration of the properties of 
space and consider the idea of time 



chapter vi 
of the idea of time 

 respecting the idea of time we may make several 
of the same remarks which we made concerning the idea 
of space in order to shew that it is not borrowed from 
experience but is a bond of connexion among the 
impressions of sense derived from a peculiar activity of 
the mind and forming a foundation both of our experience 
and of our speculative knowledge 

time is not a notion obtained by experience expe 
rience that is the impressions of sense and our con 
sciousness of our thoughts gives us various percep 
tions and different successive perceptions considered 
together exemplify the notion of change but this very 
connexion of different perceptions this successiveness 
presupposes that the perceptions exist in time that 
things happen either together or one after the other is 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

intelligible only by assuming time as the condition under 
which they are presented to us 

thus time is a necessary condition in the presentation 
of all occurrences to our minds we cannot conceive 
this condition to be taken away we can conceive 
time to go on while nothing happens in it but we can 
not conceive anything to happen while time does not 
go on 

it is clear from this that time is not an impression 
derived from experience in the same manner in which 
we derive from experience our information concerning 
the objects which exist and the occurrences which take 
place in time the objects of experience can easily be 
conceived to be or not to be to be absent as well as 
present time always is and always is present and 
even in our thoughts we cannot form the contrary sup 
position 

 thus time is something distinct from the matter 
or substance of our experience and may be considered 
as a necessary form which that matter the experience of 
change must assume in order to be an object of con 
templation to the mind time is one of the necessary 
conditions under which we apprehend the information 
which our senses and consciousness give us by con 
sidering time as a form which belongs to our power of 
apprehending occurrences and changes and under which 
alone all such experience can be accepted by the mind 
we explain the necessity which we find to exist of con 
ceiving all such changes as happening in time and we 
thus see that time is not a property perceived as existing 
in objects or as conveyed to us by our senses but a 
condition impressed upon our knowledge by the consti 
tution of the mind itself involving an act of thought as 
well as an impression of sense 

 we showed that space is an idea of the mind or 



of the perception of space t 

form of our perceiving power independent of experience 
by pointing out that we possess necessary and universal 
truths concerning the relations of space which could 
never be given by means of experience but of which 
the necessity is readily conceivable if we suppose them 
to have for their basis the constitution of the mind 
there exist also respecting number many truths abso 
lutely necessary entirely independent of experience and 
anterior to it and so far as the conception of number 
depends upon the idea of time the same argument might 
be used to show that the idea of time is not derived from 
experience but is a result of the native activity of the 
mind but we shall defer all views of this kind till we 
come to the consideration of number 

 some persons have supposed that we obtain the 
notion of time from the perception of motion but it 
is clear that the perception of motion that is change of 
place presupposes the conception of time and is not 
capable of being presented to the mind in any other way 
if we contemplate the same body as being in different 
places at different times and connect these observations 
we have the conception of motion which thus presup 
poses the necessary conditions that existence in time 
implies and thus we see that it is possible there should 
be necessary truths concerning all motion and conse 
quently concerning those motions which are the objects of 
experience but that the source of this necessity is the 
ideas of time and space which being universal conditions 
of knowledge residing in the mind afford a foundation 
for necessary truths

chapter vii 
of some peculiarities of the idea of time 

 the idea of time like the idea of space offers to 
our notice some characters which do not belong to our 
fundamental ideas generally but which are deserving of 
remark these characters are in some respects closely 
similar with regard to time and to space while in other 
respects the peculiarities of these two ideas are widely 
different we shall point out some of these charac 
ters 

time is not a general abstract notion collected from 
experience as for example a certain general con 
ception of the relations of things for we do not con 
sider particular times as examples of time in general 
as we consider particular causes to be examples of 
cause but we conceive all particular times to be parts 
of a single and endless time this continuallyflowing 
and endless time is what offers itself to us when we 
contemplate any series of occurrences all actual and 
possible times exist as parts in this original and general 
time and since all particular times are considered as 
derivable from time in general it is manifest that the 
notion of time in general cannot be derived from the 
notions of particular times the notion of time in gene 
ral is therefore not a general conception gathered from 
experience 

 time is infinite since all actual and possible 
times exist in the general course of time this general 
time must be infinite all limitation merely divides 
and does not terminate the extent of absolute time 
time has no beginning and no end but the beginning 
and the end of every other existence takes place in it 

 time like space is not only a form of perception 



some peculiarities of the idea of time 

but of intuition we contemplate events as taking 
place in time we consider its parts as added to one 
another and events as filling a larger or smaller extent 
of such parts the time which any event takes up is 
the sum of all such parts and the relation of the same 
to time is fully understood when we can clearly see what 
portions of time it occupies and what it does not 
thus the relation of known occurrences to time is 
perceived by intuition and time is a form of intuition 
of the external world 

 time is conceived as a quantity of one dimension 
it has great analogy with a line but none at all with a 
surface or solid time may be considered as consisting 
of a series of instants which are before and after one 
another and they have no other relation than this of 
before and after just the same would be the case with 
a series of points taken along a line each would be 
after those on one side of it and before those on another 
indeed the analogy between time and space of one 
dimension is so close that the same terms are applied to 
both ideas and we hardly know to which they originally 
belong times and lines are alike called long and short 
we speak of the beginning and end of a line of a point 
of time and of the limits of a portion of duration 

 but as has been said there is nothing in time 
which corresponds to more than one dimension in space 
and hence nothing which has any obvious analogy with 
figure time resembles a line indefinitely extended both 
ways all partial times are portions of this line and no 
mode of conceiving time suggests to us a line making 
any angle with the original line or any other combina 
tion which might give rise to figures of any kind the 
analogy between time and space which in many circum 
stances is so clear here disappears altogether spaces 
of two and of three dimensions planes and solids have 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

nothing to which we can compare them in the concep 
tions arising out of time 

 as figure is a conception solely appropriate to 
space there is also a conception which peculiarly belongs 
to time namely the conception of recurrence of times 
similarly marked or as it may be termed rhythm using 
this word in a general sense the term rhythm is most 
commonly used to designate the recurrence of times 
marked by the syllables of a verse or the notes of a 
melody but it is easy to see that the general conception 
of such a recurrence does not depend on the mode in 
which it is impressed upon the sense the forms of 
such recurrence are innumerable thus in such a line as 

quadrupedante putrem sonitii quatit ungula campum 

we have alternately one long or forcible syllable and 
two shorter light ones recurring over and over in like 
manner in our own language in the line 

at the close of tlie day when the hamlet is still 

we have two light and one strong syllable repeated four 
times over such repetition is the essence of versification 
the same kind of rhythm is one of the main elements 
of music with this difference only that in music the 
forcible syllables are made so for the purposes of rhythm 
by their length only for example if either of the above 
lines were imitated by a melody in the most simple and 
obvious manner each strong syllable would occupy 
exactly twice as much time as two of the weaker ones 
something very analogous to such rhythm may be traced 
in other parts of poetry and art which we need not here 
dwell upon but in reference to our present subject we 
may remark that by the introduction of such rhythm 
the flow of time which appears otherwise so perfectly 
simple and homogeneous admits of an infinite number of 
varied yet regular modes of progress all the kinds of 
versification which occur in all languages and the still 



some peculiarities of the idea of time 

more varied forms of recurrence of notes of different 
lengths which are heard in all the varied strains of melo 
dies are only examples of such modifications or configu 
rations as we may call them of time they involve re 
lations of various portions of time as figures involve re 
lations of various portions of space but yet the analogy 
between rhythm and figure is by no means very close 
for in rhythm we have relations of quantity alone in the 
parts of time whereas in figure we have relations not 
only of quantity but of a kind altogether different 
namely of position on the other hand a repetition of 
similar elements which does not necessarily occur in 
figures is quite essential in order to impress upon us that 
measured progress of time of which we here speak 
and thus the ideas of time and space have each its pecu 
liar and exclusive relations position and figure belong 
ing only to space while repetition and rhythm are appro 
priate to time 

 one of the simplest forms of recurrence is alter 
nation as when we have alternate strong and slight syl 
lables for instance 

awake arise or be for ever flln 

or without any subordination as when we reckon num 
bers and call them in succession odd even odd even 

 but the simplest of all forms of recurrence is that 
which has no variety in which a series of units each 
considered as exactly similar to the rest succeed each 
other as one one one and so on in this case however 
we are led to consider each unit with reference to all that 
have preceded and thus the series one one one and so 
forth becomes one two three four five and so on a 
series with which all are familiar and which may be con 
tinued without limit 

we thus collect from that repetition of which time 
admits the conception of number 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

 the relations of position and figure are the sub 
ject of the science of geometry and are as we have 
already said traced into a very remarkable and extensive 
body of truths which rests for its foundations on axioms 
involved in the idea of space there is in like manner 
a science of great complexity and extent which has its 
foundation in the idea of time but this science as it 
is usually pursued applies only to the conception of num 
ber which is as we have said the simplest result of repe 
tition this science is theoretical arithmetic or the spe 
culative doctrine of the properties and relations of num 
bers and we must say a few words concerning the prin 
ciples which it is requisite to assume as the basis of this 
science 



chapter viii 
of the axioms which relate to number 

 the foundations of our speculative knowledge of 
the relations and properties of number as of space are 
contained in the mode in which we represent to ourselves 
the magnitudes which are the subjects of our reasonings 
to express these foundations in axioms in the case of 
number is a matter requiring some consideration for the 
same reason as in the case of geometry that is because 
these axioms are principles which we assume as true 
without being aware that we have made any assumption 
and we cannot without careful scrutiny determine when 
we have stated in the form of axioms all that is necessary 
for the formation of the science and no more than is 
necessary we will however attempt to detect the 
principles which really must form the basis of theoretical 
arithmetic 

 why is it that three and two are equal to four and 



of the axioms which relate to number 

one because if we look at five things of any kind we 
see that it is so the five are four and one they are 
also three and two the truth of our assertion is in 
volved in our being able to conceive the number five at 
all we perceive this truth by intuition for we cannot 
see or imagine we see five things without perceiving 
also that the assertion above stated is true 

but how do we state in words this fundamental prin 
ciple of the doctrine of numbers let us consider a 
very simple case if we wish to show that seven and 
two are equal to four and five we say that seven are four 
and three therefore seven and two are four and three 
and two and because three and two are five this is four 
and five the axioms by which mathematical reasoners 
justify the first inference marked by the conjunctive 
word therefore is by saying that when equals are added 
to equals the wholes are equal and that thus since 
seven is equal to three and four if we add two to both 
seven and two are equal to four and three and two 

 such axioms as this that when equals are added to 
equals the wholes are equal are in fact expressions of 
the general condition of intuition by which a whole is 
contemplated as made up of parts and as identical with 
the aggregate of the parts and a yet more general form 
in which we might more adequately express this condi 
tion of intuition would be this that two magnitudes 
are equal when they can be divided into parts which are 
equal each to each thus in the above example seven 
and two are equal to four and five because each of 
the two sums can be divided into the parts four three 
and two 

 in all these cases a person who had never seen 
such axioms enunciated in a verbal form would employ 
the same reasoning as a practised mathematician in order 
to satisfy himself that the proposition was true the 

vol i k 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

steps of the reasoning being seen to be true by intuition 
would carry an entire conviction whether or not the 
argument were made verbally complete hence the 
axioms may appear superfluous and on this account such 
axioms have often been spoken contemptuously of as 
empty and barren assertions in fact however although 
they cannot supply the deficiency of the clear intuition 
of number and space in the reasoner himself and 
although when he possesses such a faculty he will reason 
rightly if he have never heard of such axioms they still 
have their place properly at the beginning of our trea 
tises on the science of quantity since they express as 
simply as words can express those conditions of the 
intuition of magnitudes on which all reasoning concern 
ing quantity must be based and are necessary when we 
want not only to see the truth of the elementary reason 
ings on these subjects but to put such reasonings in a 
formal and logical shape 

 we have considered the axioms which we have 
suggested above as the basis of all arithmetical opera 
tions of the nature of addition but it is easily seen 
that the same principle may be carried into other cases 
as for instance multiplication which is merely a repeated 
addition and admits of the same kind of evidence 
thus five times three are equal to three times five why 
is this if we arrange fifteen things in five rows of 
three it is seen by looking or by imaginary looking 
which is intuition that they may also be taken as three 
rows of five and thus the principle that those wholes 
are equal which can be resolved into the same partial 
magnitudes is immediately applicable in this as in the 
other case 

 we may proceed to higher numbers and may find 
ourselves obliged to use artificial nomenclature and 
notation in order to represent and reckon them but the 



of the axioms which relate to number 

reasoning in these cases also is still the same and the 
usual artifice by whicli our reasoning in such instances is 
assisted is that the number whicli is the root of our scale 
of notation which is ten in our usual system is alter 
nately separated into parts and treated as a single thing 
thus and are for is four tens and seven 
 is three tens and five whence and are seven 
tens and twelve that is tens ten and which is 
 tens and or the like reasoning is applicable in 
other cases and since the most remote and complex 
properties of numbers are obtained by a prolongation of 
a course of reasoning exactly similar to that by which we 
thus establish the most elementary propositions we have 
in the principles just noticed the foundation of the whole 
of theoretical arithmetic 



chapter ix 
of the perception of time and number 

 our perception of the passage of time involves a 
series of acts of memory this is easily seen and assented 
to when large intervals of time and a complex train of 
occurrences are concerned but since memory is requi 
site in order to apprehend time in such cases we cannot 
doubt that the same faculty must be concerned in the 
shortest and simplest cases of succession for it will 
hardly be maintained that the process by which we con 
template the progress of time is different when small 
and when large intervals are concerned if memory be 
absolutely requisite to connect two events which begin 
and end a day and to perceive a tract of time between 
them it must be equally indispensable to connect the 
beginning and end of a minute or a second though in 

k 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

this case the effort may be smaller and consequently 
more easily overlooked in common cases we are 
unconscious of the act of thought by which we recollect 
the preceding instant though we perceive the effort 
when we recollect some distant event and this is 
analogous to what happens in other instances thus we 
walk without being conscious of the volitions by which 
we move our muscles but in order to leap a distinct 
and manifest exertion of the same muscles is necessary 
yet no one will doubt that we walk as well as leap by 
an act of the will exerted through the muscles and in 
like manner our consciousness of small as well as large 
intervals of time involves something of the nature of an 
act of memory 

 but this constant and almost imperceptible kind 
of memory by which we connect the beginning and end 
of each instant as it passes may very fitly be distinguished 
in common cases from manifest acts of recollection 
although it may be difficult or impossible to separate the 
two operations in general this perpetual and latent 
kind of memory may be termed a sense of successive 
ness and must be considered as an internal sense by 
which we perceive ourselves existing in time much in 
the same way as by our external or muscular sense 
we perceive ourselves existing in space and both our 
internal thoughts and feelings and the events which 
take place around us are apprehended as objects of this 
internal sense and thus as taking place in time 

 in the same manner in which our interpretation 
of the notices of the muscular sense implies the power of 
moving our limbs and of touching at will this object or 
that our apprehension of the relations of time by means 
of the internal sense of successiveness implies a power of 
recalling what has past and of retaining what is pass 
ing we are able to seize the occurrences which have 



perception of time and number 

just taken place and to hold them fast in our minds so 
as mentally to measure their distance in time from occur 
rences now present and thus this sense of successive 
ness like the muscular sense with which we have com 
pared it implies activity of the mind itself and is not a 
sense passively receiving impressions 

 the conception of number appears to require the 
exercise of the same sense of succession at first sight 
indeed we seem to apprehend number without any act 
of memory or any reference to time for example we 
look at a horse and see that his legs are four and this 
we seem to do at once without reckoning them but it 
is not difficult to see that this seeming instantaneousness 
of the perception of small numbers is an illusion this 
resembles the many other cases in which we perform 
short and easy acts so rapidly and familiarly that we are 
unconscious of them as in the acts of seeing and of arti 
culating our words and this is the more manifest since 
we begin our acquaintance with number by counting even 
the smallest numbers children and very rude savages 
must use an effort to reckon even their five fingers and 
find a difficulty in going further and persons have 
been known who were able by habit or by a peculiar 
natural aptitude to count by dozens as rapidly as common 
persons can by units we may conclude therefore that 
when we appear to catch a small number by a single 
glance of the eye we do in fact count the units of it in a 
regular though very brief succession to count requires 
an act of memory of this we are sensible when we 
count very slowly as when we reckon the strokes of a 
church clock for in such a case we may forget in the 
intervals of the strokes and miscount now it will not 
be doubted that the nature of the process in counting is 
the same whether we count fast or slow there is no 
definite speed of reckoning at which the faculties which 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

it requires are changed and therefore memory which is 
requisite in some cases must be so in all 

the act of counting one two three and so on is 
the foundation of all our knowledge of number the 
intuition of the relations of number involves this act of 
counting for as we have just seen the conception of 
number cannot be obtained in any other way and thus 
the whole of theoretical arithmetic depends upon an act 
of the mind and upon the conditions which the exercise 
of that act implies these have been already explained 
in the last chapter 

 but if the apprehension of number be accompanied 
by an act of the mind the apprehension of rhythm is so 
still more clearly all the forms of versification and the 
measures of melodies are the creations of man who thus 
realises in words and sounds the forms of recurrence 
which rise within his own mind when we hear in a 
quiet scene any rapidlyrepeated sound as those made by 
the hammer of the smith or the saw of the carpenter 
every one knows how insensibly we throw these noises 
into a rhythmical form in our own apprehension we 
do this even without any suggestion from the sounds 
themselves for instance if the beats of a clock or 
watch be ever so exactly alike we still reckon them 
alternately ticktack ticktack that this is the case 
may be proved by taking a watch or clock of such a con 
struction that the returning swing of the pendulum is 
silent and in which therefore all the beats are rigor 
ously alike we shall find ourselves still reckoning its 
sounds as ticktack in this instance it is manifest that 
the rhythm is entirely of our own making in melo 
dies also and in verses in which the rhythm is complex 
obscure and difficult we perceive something is required 
on our part for we are often incapable of contributing 
our share and thus lose the sense of the measure alto 



perception of time and number 

gether and when we consider such cases and attend to 
what passes within us when we catch the measure even 
of the simplest and bestknown air we shall no longer 
doubt that an act of our own thoughts is requisite in 
such cases as well as impressions on the sense and 
thus the conception of this peculiar modification of time 
which we have called rhythm like all the other views 
which we have taken of the subject shows that we must 
in order to form such conceptions supply a certain idea 
by our own thoughts as well as merely receive by senses 
whether external or internal the impressions of appear 
ances and collections of appearances 



chapter x 
of mathematical reasoning 

 discursive reasoning we have thus seen that 
our notions of space time and their modifications neces 
sarily involve a certain activity of the mind and that 
the conditions of this activity form the foundations of 
those sciences which have the relations of space time 
and number for their object upon the fundamental 
principles thus established the various sciences which 
are included in the term pure mathematics geometry 
algebra trigonometry conic sections and the rest of 
the higher geometry the differential calculus and the 
like are built up by a series of reasonings these rea 
sonings are subject to the rules of logic as we have 
already remarked nor is it necessary here to dwell long 
on the nature and rules of such processes but we may 
here notice that such processes are termed discursive in 
opposition to the operations by which we acquire our 
fundamental principles which are as we have seen intui 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

tive this opposition was formerly very familiar to our 
writers as milton 

 thus the soul reason receives 
discursive or intuitive paradise lost v 

for in such reasonings we obtain our conclusions not by 
looking at our conceptions steadily in one view which is 
intuition but by passing from one view to another like 
those who run from place to place discursus thus a 
straight line may be at the same time a side of a triangle 
and a radius of a circle and in the first proposition of 
euclid a line is considered first in one of these relations 
and then in the other and thus the sides of a certain 
triangle are proved to be equal and by this discourse 
of reason as by our older writers it was termed we set 
forth from those axioms which we perceive by intuition 
travel securely over a vast and varied region and become 
possessed of a copious store of mathematical truths 

 technical terms of reasoning the reasoning of 
mathematics thus proceeding from a few simple principles 
to many truths is conducted according to the rules of 
logic if it be necessary mathematical proofs may be 
reduced to logical forms and expressed in syllogisms 
consisting of major minor and conclusion but in most 
cases the syllogism is of that kind which is called by logical 
writers an enthymeme a word which implies something 
existing in the thoughts only and which designates a syl 
logism in which one of the premises is understood and 
not expressed thus we say in a mathematical proof 
 because the point c is the centre of the circle a b a c 
is equal to bc not stating the major that all lines 
drawn from the centre of a circle to the circumference 
are equal or introducing it only by a transient reference 
to the definition of a circle but the enthymeme is so 
constantly used in all habitual forms of reasoning that it 
does not occur to us as being anything peculiar in mathe 
matical works 



of mathematical reasoning 

the propositions which are proved to be generally 
true are termed theorems but when anything is required 
to be done as to draw a line or a circle under given con 
ditions this proposition is a problem a theorem requires 
demonstration a problem solution and for both pur 
poses the mathematician usually makes a construction 
he directs us to draw certain lines circles or other 
curves on which is to be founded his demonstration that 
his theorem is true or that his problem is solved some 
times too he establishes some lemma or preparatory pro 
position before he proceeds to his main task and often 
he deduces from his demonstration some conclusion in 
addition to that which was the professed object of his 
proposition and this is termed a corollary 

these technical terms are noted here not as being 
very important but in order that they may not sound 
strange and unintelligible if we should have occasion to 
use some of them there is however one technical dis 
tinction more peculiar and more important 

 geometrical analysis and synthesis in geome 
trical reasoning such as we have described we introduce 
at every step some new consideration and it is by com 
bining all these considerations that we arrive at the con 
clusion that is the demonstration of the proposition 
each step tends to the final result by exhibiting some 
part of the figure under a new relation to what we 
have already proved is added something more and hence 
this process is called synthesis or putting together the 
proof flows on receiving at every turn new contributions 
from different quarters like a river fed and augmented 
by many tributary streams and each of these tribu 
taries flows from some definition or axiom as its fountain 
or is itself formed by the union of smaller rivulets which 
have sources of this kind in descending along its course 
the synthetical proof gathers all these accessions into one 
common tifink the proposition finally proved 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

 but we may proceed in a different manner we 
may begin from the formed river and ascend to its 
sources we may take the proposition of which we 
require a proof and may examine what the supposition 
of its truth implies if this be true then something else 
may be seen to be true and from this something else 
and so on we may often in this way discover of what 
simpler propositions our theorem or solution is com 
pounded and may resolve these in succession till we come 
to some proposition which is obvious this is geometrical 
analysis having succeeded in this analytical process 
we may invert it and may descend again from the 
simple and known propositions to the proof of a 
theorem or the solution of a problem which was our 
startingplace 

this process resembles as we have said tracing a 
river to its sources as we ascend the stream we per 
petually meet with bifurcations and some sagacity is 
needed to enable us to see which in each case is the 
main stream but if we proceed in our research we 
exhaust the unexplored valleys and finally obtain a clear 
knowledge whence the waters flow analytical is some 
times confounded with symbolical reasoning on which 
subject we shall make a remark in the next chapter 
the object of that chapter is to notice certain other fun 
damental principles and ideas not included in those 
hitherto spoken of which we find thrown in our way as 
we proceed in our mathematical speculations it would 
detain us too long and involve us in subtle and technical 
disquisitions to examine fully the grounds of these prin 
ciples but mathematics hold so important a place in 
relation to the inductive sciences that i shall briefly 
notice the leading ideas which the ulterior progress of the 
subject involves 



 



chapter xi 

of the foundations of the higher 
mathematics 

 the idea of a limit the general truths concern 
ing relations of space which depend upon the axioms 
and definitions contained in euclids elements and which 
involve only properties of straight lines and circles are 
termed elementary geometry all beyond this belongs to 
the higher geometry to this latter province appertain 
for example all propositions respecting the lengths of any 
portions of curve lines for these cannot be obtained by 
means of the principles of the elements alone here 
then we must ask to what other principles the geometer 
has recourse and from what source these are drawn is 
there any origin of geometrical truth which we have not 
yet explored 

the idea of a limit supplies a new mode of establish 
ing mathematical truths thus with regard to the length 
of any portion of a curve a problem which we have just 
mentioned a curve is not made up of straight lines and 
therefore we cannot by means of any of the doctrines of 
elementary geometry measure the length of any curve 
but we may make up a figure nearly resembling any curve 
by putting together many short straight lines just as a 
polygonal building of very many sides may nearly resemble 
a circular room and in order to approach nearer and 
nearer to the curve we may make the sides more and 
more small more and more numerous we may then 
possiblyfind some mode of measurement some relation 
of these small lines to other lines which is not disturbed 
by the multiplication of the sides however far it be 
carried and thus we may do what is equivalent to 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

measuring the curve itself for by multiplying the sides 
we may approach more and more closely to the curve till 
no appreciable difference remains the curve line is the 
limit of the polygon and in this process we proceed on 
the axiom that what is true up to the limit is true at 
the limit 

this mode of conceiving mathematical magnitudes is 
of wide extent and use for every curve may be con 
sidered as the limit of some polygon every varied 
magnitude as the limit of some aggregate of simpler 
forms and thus the relations of the elementary figures 
enable us to advance to the properties of the most com 
plex cases 

a limit is a peculiar and fundamental conception the 
use of which in proving the propositions of the higher 
geometry cannot be superseded by any combination of 
other hypotheses and definitions the axiom just noticed 
that what is true up to the limit is true at the limit is 
involved in the very conception of a limit and this 
principle with its consequences leads to all the results 
which form the subject of the higher mathematics whe 
ther proved by the consideration of evanescent triangles 

 this assertion cannot be fully proved and illustrated without a 
reference to mathematical reasonings which would not be generally 
intelligible i have shown the truth of the assertion in my thoughts 
on the study of mathematics annexed to the principles of english 
university education the proof is of this kind the ultimate 
equality of an arc of a curve and the corresponding periphery of a 
polygon when the sides of the polygon are indefinitely increased in 
number is evident but this truth cannot be proved from any other 
axiom for if we take the supposed axiom that a curve is always 
less than the including broken line this is not true except with a con 
dition and in tracing the import of this condition we find its neces 
sity becomes evident only when we introduce a reference to a limit 
and the same is the case if we attempt to supersede the notion of a 
limit in proving any other simple and evident proposition in which 
that notion is involved therefore these evident truths are evident 
in virtue of the idea of a limit 



the foundation of the higher mathematics 

by the processes of the differential calculus or in any 
other way 

the ancients did not expressly introduce this con 
ception of a limit into their mathematical reasonings 
although in the application of what is termed the 
method of exhaustions in which they show how to 
exhaust the difference between a polygon and a curve or 
the like they were in fact proceeding upon an obscure 
apprehension of principles equivalent to those of the 
method of limits yet the necessary fundamental prin 
ciple not having in their time been clearly developed 
their reasonings were both needlessly intricate and imper 
fectly satisfactory moreover they were led to put in the 
place of axioms assumptions which were by no means 
selfevident as when archimedes assumed for the basis 
of his measure of the circumference of the circle the 
proposition that a circular arch is necessarily less than 
two lines which inclose it joining its extremities the 
reasonings of the older mathematicians which professed 
to proceed upon such assumptions led to true results 
in reality only because they were guided by a latent 
reference to the limiting case of such assumptions and 
this latent employment of the conception of a limit 
reappeared in various forms during the early period of 
modern mathematics as for example in the method of 
indivisibles of cavalleri and the characteristic triangle 
of barrow till at last newton distinctly referred such 
reasonings to the conception of a limit and established 
the fundamental principles and processes which that 
conception introduces with a distinctness and exactness 
which required little improvement to make it as unim 
peachable as the demonstrations of geometry and 
when such processes as newton thus deduced from the 
conception of a limit are represented by means of general 
algebraical symbols instead of geometrical diagrams 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

we have then before us the method of fluxions or the 
differential calculus a mode of treating mathematical 
problems justly considered as the principal weapon by 
which the splendid triumphs of modern mathematics 
have been achieved 

 the use of general symbols the employment 
of algebraical symbols of which we have just spoken 
has been another of the main instruments to which the 
successes of modern mathematics are owing and here 
again the processes by which we obtain our results 
depend for their evidence upon a fundamental conception 
the conception of arbitrary symbols as the signs of 
quantity and its relations and upon a corresponding 
axiom that the interpretation of such symbols must be 
perfectly general in this case as in the last it was 
only by degrees that mathematicians were led to a just 
apprehension of the grounds of their reasoning for 
symbols were at first used only to represent numbers 
considered with regard to their numerical properties and 
thus the science of algebra was formed but it was 
found even in cases belonging to common algebra that 
the symbols often admitted of an interpretation which 
went beyond the limits of the problem and which yet 
was not unmeaning since it pointed out a question closely 
analogous to the question proposed this was the case 
for example when the answer was a negative quantity 
for when descartes had introduced the mode of repre 
senting curves by means of algebraical relations among 
the symbols of the coordinates or distances of each of 
their points from fixed lines it was found that negative 
quantities must be dealt with as not less truly significa 
tive than positive ones and as the researches of mathe 
maticians proceeded other cases also were found in which 
the symbols although destitute of meaning according to 
the original conventions of their institution still pointed 



the foundation of the higher mathematics 

out truths which could be verified in other ways as in 
the cases in which what are called impossible quantities 
occur such processes may usually be confirmed upon 
other principles and the truth in question may be esta 
blished by means of a demonstration in which no such 
seeming fallacies defeat the reasoning but it has also 
been shown in many such cases that the process in which 
some of the steps appear to be without real meaning 
does in fact involve a valid proof of the proposition 
and what we have here to remark is that this is not 
true accidentally or partially only but that the results of 
systematic symbolical reasoning must always express 
general truths by their nature and do not for their 
justification require each of the steps of the process to 
represent some definite operation upon quantity the 
absolute universality of the interpretation of symbols is the 
fundamental principle of their use this has been shown 
very ably by professor peacock in his algebra he has 
there illustrated in a variety of ways this principle that 
 if general symbols express an identity when they are 
supposed to be of any special nature they must also ex 
press an identity when they are general in their nature 
and thus this universality of symbols is a principle in 
addition to those we have already noticed and is a prin 
ciple of the greatest importance in the formation of 
mathematical science according to the wide generality 
which such science has in modern times assumed 

 connexion of symbols and analysis since in our 
symbolical reasoning our symbols thus reason for us we 
do not necessarily here as in geometrical reasoning go 
on adding carefully one known truth to another till we 
reach the desired result on the contrary if we have a 
theorem to prove or a problem to solve which can be 
brought under the domain of our symbols we may at 
once state the given but unproved truth or the given 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

combination of unknown quantities in its symbolical 
form after this first process we may then proceed to 
trace by means of our symbols what other truth is 
involved in the one thus stated or what the unknown 
symbols must signify resolving step by step the symbolical 
assertion with which we began into others more fitted for 
our purpose the former process is a kind of synthesis 
the latter is termed analysis and although symbolical 
reasoning does not necessarily imply such analysis yet 
the connexion is so familiar that the term analysis is 
frequently used to designate symbolical reasoning 



chapter xii 
the doctrine of motion 

 pure mechanism the doctrine of motion of 
which we have here to speak is that in which motion is 
considered quite independently of its cause force for 
all consideration of force belongs to a class of ideas en 
tirely different from those with which we are here con 
cerned in this view it may be termed the pure doctrine 
of motion since it has to do solely with space and time 
which are the subjects of pure mathematics although 
the doctrine of motion in connexion with force which is 
the subject of mechanics is by far the most important 
form in which the consideration of motion enters into 
the formation of our sciences the pure doctrine of mo 
tion which treats of space time and velocity might be 
followed out so as to give rise to a very considerable and 
curious body of science such a science is the science 
of mechanism independent of force and considered as 
the solution of a problem which may be thus enunciated 
 to communicate any given motion from a first mover to 



the doctrine of motion 

a given body the science which should have for its 
object to solve all the various cases into which this pro 
blem would ramify might be termed pure mechanism in 
contradistinction to mechanics proper or machinery in 
which force is taken into consideration the greater 
part of the machines which have been constructed for 
use in manufactures have been practical solutions of some 
of the cases of this problem we have also important 
contributions to such a science in the works of mathe 
maticians for example the various investigations and 
demonstrations which have been published respecting 
the form of the teeth of wheels and mr babbages 
memoir on the language of machinery there are 
also several works which contain collections of the 
mechanical contrivances which have been invented for 
the purpose of transmitting and modifying motion and 
these works may be considered as treatises on the science 
of pure mechanism but this science has not yet been 
reduced to the systematic simplicity which is desirable 
nor indeed generally recognised as a separate science it 
has been confounded under the common name of mecha 
nics with the other science mechanics proper or ma 
chinery which considers the effect of force transmitted 
by mechanism from one part of a material combination to 
another for example the mechanical powers as they 
are usually termed the lever the wheel and axle the 
inclined plane the wedge and the screw have almost 
always been treated with reference to the relation be 
tween the power and the weight and not primarily as a 
mode of changing the velocity and kind of the motion 
the science of pure motion has not generally been sepa 
rated from the science of motion viewed with reference 
to its causes 

 on a method of expressing by signs the action of machinery 
phil trans p

recently indeed the necessity of such a separation 
has been seen by those who have taken a philosophical 
view of science thus this necessity has been urged by 
m ampere in his essai sur la philosophic des sciences 
 long he says p before i employed 
myself upon the present work i had remarked that it is 
usual to omit in the beginning of all books treating of 
sciences which regard motion and force certain conside 
rations which duly developed must constitute a special 
science of which science certain parts have been treated 
of either in memoirs or in special works such for exam 
ple as that of carnot upon motion considered geometri 
cally and the essay of lanz and betancourt upon the 
composition of machines he then proceeds to describe 
this science nearly as we have done and proposes to term 
it kinematics cinematique from kivrjiia motion 

 formal astronomy i shall not attempt here fur 
ther to develop the form which such a science must 
assume but i may notice one very large province which 
belongs to it when men had ascertained the apparent 
motions of the sun moon and stars to a moderate de 
gree of regularity and accuracy they tried to conceive in 
their minds some mechanism by which these motions 
might be produced and thus they in fact proposed to 
themselves a very extensive problem in kinematics this 
indeed was the view originally entertained of the nature 
of the science of astronomy thus plato in the seventh 
book of his republic speaks of astronomy as the 
doctrine of the motion of solids meaning thereby spheres 
and the same was a proper description of the science 
till the time of kepler and even later for kepler 
endeavoured though in vain to conjoin with the know 
ledge of the motions of the heavenly bodies those true 
mechanical conceptions which converted formal into 
physical astronomy f 

 p t hist ind c ii 



the doctrine of motion 

the astronomy of the ancients admitted none but 
uniform circular motions and could therefore be com 
pletely cultivated by the aid of their elementary geo 
metry but the pure science of motion might be extended 
to all motions however varied as to the speed or the path 
of the moving body in this form it must depend upon 
the doctrine of limits and the fundamental principle of 
its reasonings would be this that velocity is measured 
by the limit of the space described considered with 
reference to the times in which it is described i shall 
not further pursue this subject and in order to complete 
what i have to say respecting the pure sciences i have 
only a few words to add respecting their bearing on 
inductive science in general 



chapter xiii 

of the application of mathematics to 
the inductive sciences 

 all objects in the world which can be made the 
subjects of our contemplation are subordinate to the con 
ditions of space time and number and on this account 
the doctrines of pure mathematics have most numerous 
and extensive applications in every department of our 
investigations of nature and there is a peculiarity in 
these ideas which has caused the mathematical sciences 
to be in all cases the first successful efforts of the awak 
ening speculative powers of nations at the commence 
ment of their intellectual progress conceptions derived 
from these ideas are from the very first perfectly precise 
and clear so as to be fit elements of scientific truths 
this is not the case with the other conceptions which 
form the subjects of scientific inquiries the conception 

l 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

of statical force for instance was never presented in a 
distinct form till the works of archimedes appeared 
the conception of accelerating force was confused in the 
mind of kepler and his contemporaries and only became 
clear enough for purposes of sound scientific reasoning 
in the succeeding century the just conception of che 
mical composition of elements gradually in modern times 
emerged from the erroneous and vague notions of the 
ancients if we take works published on such subjects 
before the epoch when the foundations of the true science 
were laid we find the knowledge not only small but 
worthless the writers did not see any evidence in what 
we now consider as the axioms of the science nor any 
inconsistency where we now see selfcontradiction but 
this was never the case with speculations concerning 
space and number from their first rise these were 
true as far as they went the geometry and arithmetic 
of the greeks and indians even in their first and most 
scanty form contained none but true propositions mens 
intuitions upon these subjects never allowed them to 
slide into error and confusion and the truths to which 
they were led by the first efforts of their faculties so 
employed form part of the present stock of our mathe 
matical knowledge 

 but we are here not so much concerned with mathe 
matics in their pure form as with their application to the 
phenomena and laws of nature and here also the very 
earliest history of civilization presents to us some of the 
most remarkable examples of mans success in his attempts 
to attain to science space and time position and motion 
govern all visible objects but by far the most conspicuous 
examples of the relations which arise out of such elements 
are displayed by the evermoving luminaries of the sky 
which measure days and months and years by their 
motions and mans place on the earth by their position 



inductive application of mathematics 

hence the sciences of space and number were from the 
first cultivated with peculiar reference to astronomy i 
have elsewhere quoted platos remark that it is absurd 
to call the science of the relations of space geometry the 
measure of the earth since its most important office is to 
be found in its application to the heavens and on other 
occasions also it appears how strongly he who may be 
considered as the representative of the scientific and 
speculative tendencies of his time and country had been 
impressed with the conviction that the formation of a 
science of the celestial motions must depend entirely 
upon the progress of mathematics in the epilogue to 
the dialogue on the laws he declares mathematical 
knowledge to be the first and main requisite for the 
astronomer and describes the portions of it which he 
holds necessary for astronomical speculators to culti 
vate these seem to be plane geometry theoretical 
arithmetic the application of arithmetic to planes 
and to solids and finally the doctrine of harmonics 
indeed the bias of plato appears to be rather to con 
sider mathematics as the essence of the science of 
astronomy than as its instrument and he seems dis 
posed in this as in other things to disparage observation 
and to aspire after a science founded upon demon 
stration alone an astronomer he says in the same 
place must not be like hesiod and persons of that 
kind whose astronomy consists in noting the settings 
and risings of the stars but he must be one who 
understands the revolutions of the celestial spheres each 
performing its proper cycle 

a large portion of the mathematics of the greeks 
so long as their scientific activity continued was directed 
towards astronomy besides many curious propositions 
of plane and solid geometry to which their astronomers 

 hist ind sc i t epinomis p 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

were led their arithmetic though very inconvenient in 
its fundamental assumptions was cultivated to a great 
extent and the science of trigonometry in which pro 
blems concerning the relations of space were resolved by 
means of tables of numerical results previously obtained 
was created menelaus of alexandria wrote six books 
on chords probably containing methods of calculating 
tables of these quantities such tables were familiarly 
used by the later greek astronomers the same author 
also wrote three books on spherical trigonometry which 
are still extant 

 the greeks however in the first vigour of their pur 
suit of mathematical truth at the time of plato and soon 
after had by no means confined themselves to those 
propositions which had a visible bearing on the phe 
nomena of nature but had followed out many beau 
tiful trains of research concerning various kinds of 
figures for the sake of their beauty alone as for instance 
in their doctrine of conic sections of which curves they 
had discovered all the principal properties but it is 
curious to remark that these investigations thus pursued 
at first as mere matters of curiosity and intellectual 
gratification were destined two thousand years later to 
play a very important part in establishing that system 
of the celestial motions which succeeded the platonic 
scheme of cycles and epicycles if the properties of the 
conic sections had not been demonstrated by the greeks 
and thus rendered familiar to the mathematicians of suc 
ceeding ages kepler would probably not have been able 
to discover those laws respecting the orbits and motions 
of the planets which were the occasion of the greatest 
revolution that ever happened in the history of science 

 the arabians who as i have elsewhere said added 
little of their own to the stores of science which they 
received from the greeks did however make some very 



inductive application of mathematics 

important contributions in those portions of pure mathe 
matics which are subservient to astronomy their adop 
tion of the indian mode of computation by means of the 
ten digits and by the method 
of local values instead of the cumbrous sexagesimal 
arithmetic of the greeks was an improvement by which 
the convenience and facility of numerical calculations were 
immeasurably augmented the arabians also rendered 
several of the processes of trigonometry much more 
commodious by using the sine of an arc instead of the 
chord an improvement which albategnius appears to 
claim for himself and by employing also the tangents 
of arcs or as they called themf upright shadows 

 the constant application of mathematical knowledge 
to the researches of astronomy and the mutual influence 
of each science on the progress of the other has been 
still more conspicuous in modem times newtons 
method of prime and ultimate ratios which we have 
already noticed as the first correct exposition of the 
doctrine of a limit is stated in a series of lemmas or 
preparatory theorems prefixed to his treatise on the system 
of the world both the properties of curve lines and the 
doctrines concerning force and motion which he had to 
establish required that the common mathematical methods 
should be methodized and extended if newton had 
not been a most expert and inventive mathematician as 
well as a profound and philosophical thinker he could 
never have made any one of those vast strides in disco 
very of which the rapid succession in his work strikes us 
with wonder t and if we see that the great task begun 
by him goes on more slowly in the hands of his imme 
diate successors and lingers a little before its full comple 
tion we perceive that this arises in a great measure from 

 delambre ast m a p t ibid p

the defect of the mathematical methods then used new 
tons synthetical modes of investigation as we have else 
where observed were an instrument powerful indeed 
in his mighty hand but too ponderous for other persons 
to employ with effect the countrymen of newton 
clung to it the longest out of veneration for their 
master and english cultivators of physical astronomy 
were on that very account left behind the progress of 
mathematical science in france and germany by a wide 
interval which they have only recently recovered on 
the continent the advantages offered by a familiar use of 
symbols and by attention to their symmetry and other 
relations were accepted without reserve in this manner 
the differential calculus of leibnitz which was in its 
origin and signification identical with the method of 
fluxions of newton soon surpassed its rival in the 
extent and generality of its application to problems 
this calculus was applied to the science of mechanics to 
which it along with the symmetrical use of coordinates 
gave a new form for it was soon seen that the most 
difficult problems might in general be reduced to finding 
integrals which is the reciprocal process of that by which 
differentials are found so that all difficulties of physical 
astronomy were reduced to difficulties of symbolical cal 
culation these indeed being often sufficiently stubborn 
clairaut euler and dalembert employed the increased 
resources of mathematical science upon the theory of 
the moon and other questions relative to the system of 
the world and thus began to pursue such inquiries in 
the course in which mathematicians are still labouring up 
to the present day this course was not without its checks 
and perplexities we have elsewhere quoted f clairauts 
expression when he had obtained the very complex 
differential equations which contain the solution of the 

 hist ind sc ii t ii 



inductive application of mathematics 

problem of the moons motion now integrate them 
who can but in no very long time they were inte 
grated at least approximately and the methods of 
approximation have since then been improved so that 
now with a due expenditure of labour they may be 
carried to any extent which is thought desirable if the 
methods of astronomical observation should hereafter 
reach a higher degree of exactness than they now profess 
so that irregularities in the motions of the sun moon and 
planets shall be detected which at present escape us the 
mathematical part of the theory of universal gravitation is 
in such a condition that it can soon be brought into com 
parison with the newlyobserved facts indeed at present 
the mathematical theory is in advance of such observa 
tions it can venture to suggest what may afterwards 
be detected as well as to explain what has already been 
observed this has happened recently for professor 
airy has calculated the law and amount of an inequality 
depending upon the mutual attraction of the earth and 
venus of which inequality so small is it it remains to 
be determined whether its effect can be traced in the 
series of astronomical observations 

 as the influence of mathematics upon the progress 
of astronomy is thus seen in the cases in which theory and 
observation confirm each other so this influence appears 
in another way in the very few cases in which the facts 
have not been fully reduced to an agreement with theory 
the most conspicuous case of this kind is the state of our 
knowledge of the tides this is a portion of astronomy 
for the newtonian theory asserts these curious phenomena 
to be the result of the attraction of the sun and moon 
nor can there be any doubt that this is true as a general 
statement yet the subject is up to the present time a 
blot on the perfection of the theory of universal gravita 
tion for we are very far from being able in this as in the 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

other parts of astronomy to show that theory will exactly 
account for the time and magnitude and all other cir 
cumstances of the phenomenon at every place on the 
earths surface and what is the portion of our mathe 
matics which is connected with this solitary signal defect 
in astronomy it is the mathematics of the motion of 
fluids a portion in which extremely little progress has 
been made and in which all the more general problems 
of the subject have hitherto remained entirely insoluble 
the attempts of the greatest mathematicians newton 
maclaurin bernoulli clairaut laplace to master such 
questions all involve some gratuitous assumption which 
is introduced because the problem cannot otherwise be 
mathematically dealt with these assumptions confessedly 
render the result defective and how defective it is hard to 
say and it was probably precisely the absence of a theory 
which could be reasonably expected to agree with the 
observations which made observations of this very curious 
phenomenon the tides to be so much neglected as till 
very recently they were of late years such observations 
have been pursued and their results have been resolved 
into empirical laws so that the rules of the phenomena 
have been ascertained although the dependence of these 
rules upon the lunar and solar forces has not been shown 
here then we have a portion of our knowledge relating to 
facts undoubtedly dependent upon universal gravitation 
in which observation has outstripped theory in her pro 
gress and is compelled to wait till her usual companion 
overtakes her this is a position of which theory has 
usually been very impatient and we may expect that she 
will be no less so in the present instance 

 it would be easy to show from the history of other 
sciences for example mechanics and optics how essential 
the cultivation of pure mathematics has been to their 
progress the parabola was already familiar among 



inductive application of mathematics 

mathematicians when galileo discovered that it was the 
theoretical path of a projectile and the extension and 
generalization of the laws of motion could never have 
been effected unless the differential and integral calculus 
had been at hand ready to trace the results of every hypo 
thesis which could be made dalemberts mode of 
expressing the third law of motion in its most general 
form if it did not prove the law at least reduced the 
application of it to analytical processes which could be per 
formed in most of those cases in which they were needed 
in many instances the demands of mechanical science 
suggested the extension of the methods of pure analysis 
the problem of vibrating strings gave rise to the calculus 
of partial differences which was still further stimulated 
by its application to the motions of fluids and other 
mechanical problems and we have in the writings of 
lagrange and laplace other instances equally remarkable 
of new analytical methods to which mechanical problems 
and especially cosmical problems have given occasion 

 the progress of optics as a science has in like manner 
been throughout dependent upon the progress of pure 
mathematics the first rise of geometry was followed by 
some advances slight ones no doubt in the doctrine of 
reflection and in perspective the law of refraction was 
traced to its consequences by means of trigonometry 
which indeed was requisite to express the law in a simple 
form the steps made in optical science by descartes 
newton euler and huyghens required the geometrical 
skill which those philosophers possessed and if young 
and fresnel had not been each in his peculiar way per 
sons of eminent mathematical endowments they would 
not have been able to bring the theory of undulations 
and interferences into a condition in which it could be 
tested by experiments we may see how unexpectedly 

 hist ind ii 



 philosophy of the pure sciences 

recondite parts of pure mathematics may bear upon phy 
sical science by calling to mind a circumstance already 
noticed in the history of science that fresnel 
obtained one of the most curious confirmations of the 
theory the laws of circular polarization by reflection 
through an interpretation of an algebraical expression 
which according to the original conventional meaning of 
the symbols involved an impossible quantity we have 
already remarked that in virtue of the principle of the 
generality of symbolical language such an interpretation 
may often point out some real and important analogy 

 from this rapid sketch it may be seen how important 
an office in promoting the progress of the physical sciences 
belongs to mathematics indeed in the progress of many 
sciences every step has been so intimately connected with 
some advance in mathematics that we can hardly be 
surprised if some persons have considered mathematical 
reasoning to be the most essential part of such sciences 
and have overlooked the other elements which enter into 
their formation how erroneous this view is we shall 
best see by turning our attention to the other ideas besides 
those of space number and motion which enter into 
some of the most conspicuous and admired portions of 
what is termed exact science and by showing that the 
clear and distinct developement of such ideas is quite 
as necessary to the progress of exact and real knowledge 
as an acquaintance with arithmetic and geometry

the philosophy of the mechanical 
sciences 



chapter i 
of the mechanical sciences 

in the history of the sciences that class of which we 
here speak occupies a conspicuous and important place 
coming into notice immediately after those parts of 
astronomy which require for their cultivation merely the 
ideas of space time motion and number it appears 
from our history that certain truths concerning the equi 
librium of bodies were established by archimedes that 
after a long interval of inactivity his principles were 
extended and pursued further in modern times and 
that to these doctrines concerning equilibrium and the 
forces which produce it which constitute the science 
statics were added many other doctrines concerning the 
motions of bodies considered also as produced by forces 
and thus the science of dynamics was produced the 
assemblage of these sciences composes the province of 
mechanics moreover philosophers have laboured to 
make out the laws of the equilibrium of fluid as well as 
solid bodies and hence has arisen the science of hydro 
statics and the doctrines of mechanics have been found 
to have a most remarkable bearing upon the motions of 
the heavenly bodies with reference to which indeed 
they were at first principally studied the explanation of 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

those cosmical facts by means of mechanical principles 
and their consequences forms the science of physical 
astronomy these are the principal examples of mecha 
nical science although some other portions of physics 
as magnetism and electrodynamics introduce mecha 
nical doctrines very largely into their speculations 

now in all these sciences we have to consider forces 
in all mechanical reasonings forces enter either as 
producing motion or as prevented from doing so by other 
forces thus force in its most general sense is the came 
of motion or of tendency to motion and in order to 
discover the principles on which the mechanical sciences 
truly rest we must examine the nature and origin of our 
knowledge of causes 

in these sciences however we have not to deal with 
cause in its more general acceptation in which it applies 
to all kinds of agency material or immaterial to the 
influence of thought and will as well as of bodily pressure 
and attractive force our business at present is only 
with such causes as immediately operate upon matter 
we shall nevertheless in the first place consider the 
nature of cause in its most general form and afterwards 
narrow our speculations so as to direct them specially 
to the mechanical sciences 



chapter ii 
of the idea of cause 

 we see in the world around us a constant succes 
sion of causes and effects connected with each other 
the laws of this connexion we learn in a great measure 
from experience by observation of the occurrences which 
present themselves to our notice succeeding one another 



of the idea of cause 

but in doing this and in attending to this succession of 
appearances of which we are aware by means of our senses 
we supply from our own minds the idea of cause this 
idea as we have already shown with respect to other 
ideas is not derived from experience but has its origin 
in the mind itself is introduced into our experience by 
the active and not by the passive part of our nature 

by cause we mean some quality power or efficacy 
by which a state of things produces a succeeding state 
thus the motion of bodies from rest is produced by a 
cause which we call force and in the particular case in 
which bodies fall to the earth this force is termed gra 
vity in these cases the conceptions of force and gra 
vity receive their meaning from the idea of cause 
which they involve for force is conceived as the cause 
of motion that this idea of cause is not derived from 
experience we prove as in former cases by this con 
sideration that we can make assertions involving this 
idea which are rigorously necessary and universal 
whereas knowledge derived from experience can only be 
true as far as experience goes and can never contain in 
itself any evidence whatever of its necessity we assert 
that every event must have a cause and this proposi 
tion we know to be true not only probably and gene 
rally and as far as we can see but we cannot suppose 
it to be false in any single instance we are as certain 
of it as of the truths of arithmetic or geometry we 
cannot doubt that it must apply to all events past and 
future in every part of the universe just as truly as to 
those occurrences which we have ourselves observed 
what causes produce what effects what is the cause of 
any particular event what will be the effect of any pecu 
liar process these are points on which experience may 
enlighten us observation and experience may be requi 
site to enable us to judge respecting such matters but 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

that every event has some cause experience cannot prove 
any more than she can disprove she can add nothing 
to the evidence of the truth however often she may 
exemplify it this doctrine then cannot have been 
acquired by her teaching and the idea of cause which 
the doctrine involves and on which it depends cannot 
have come into our minds from the region of observa 
tion 

 that we do in fact apply the idea of cause in a 
more extensive manner than could be justified if it were 
derived from experience only is easily shown for from 
the principle that everythingmust have a cause we not 
only reason concerning the succession of events which 
occur in the progress of the world and which form the 
course of experience but we infer that the world itself 
must have a cause that the chain of events connected 
by common causation must have a first cause of a 
nature different from the events themselves this we 
are entitled to do if our idea of cause be independent of 
and superior to experience but if we have no idea of 
cause except such as we gather from experience this 
reasoning is altogether baseless and unmeaning 

 again by the use of our powers of observation 
we are aware of a succession of appearances and events 
but none of our senses or powers of external observation 
can detect in these appearances the power or quality 
which we call cause cause is that which connects one 
event with another but no sense or perception discloses 
to us or can disclose any connexion among the events 
which we observe we see that one occurrence follows 
another but we can never see anything which shows that 
one occurrence must follow another we have already 
noticed that this truth has been urged by metaphysi 
cians in modern times and generally assented to by those

who examine carefully the connexion of their own 
thoughts the arguments are indeed obvious enough 
one ball strikes another and causes it to move forwards 
but by what compulsion where is the necessity 
if the mind can see any circumstance in this case which 
makes the result inevitable let this circumstance be 
pointed out but in fact there is no such discoverable 
necessity for we can conceive this event not to take 
place at all the struck ball may stand still for aught 
we can see but the laws of motion will not allow it to 
do so doubtless they will not but the laws of motion 
are learnt from experience and therefore can prove no 
necessity why should not the laws of motion be other 
than they are are they necessarily true that they 
are necessarily such as do actually regulate the impact of 
bodies is at least no obvious truth and therefore this 
necessity cannot be in common minds the ground of 
connecting the impact of one ball with the motion of 
another and assuredly if this fail no other ground of 
such necessary connexion can be shown in this case 
then the events are not seen to be necessarily connected 
but if this case where one ball moves another by impulse 
be not an instance of events exhibiting a necessary con 
nexion we shall look in vain for any example of such a 
connexion there is then no case in which events can 
be observed to be necessarily connected our idea of 
causation which implies that the event is necessarily 
connected with the cause cannot be derived from obser 
vation 

 but it may be said we have not any such idea of 
cause implying necessary connexion with effect and a 
quality by which this connexion is produced we see 
nothing but the succession of events and by cause we 
mean nothing but a certain succession of events namely 
a constant unvarying succession cause and effect are

only two events of which the second invariably follows 
the first we delude ourselves when we imagine that 
our idea of causation involves anything more than this 

to this i reply by asking what then is the meaning 
of the maxim above quoted and allowed by all to be 
universally and necessarily true that every event must 
have a cause let us put this maxim into the language 
of the explanation just noticed and it becomes this 
 every event must have a certain other event invariably 
preceding it but why must it where is the necessity 
why must like events always be preceded by like except 
so far as other events interfere that there is such a 
necessity no one can doubt all will allow that if a stone 
ascend because it is thrown upwards in one case a stone 
which ascends in another case has also been thrown up 
wards or has undergone some equivalent operation all 
will allow that in this sense every kind of event must 
have some other specific kind of event preceding it but 
this turn of mens thoughts shows that they see in events 
a connexion which is not mere succession they see in 
cause and effect not merely what does often or always 
precede and follow but what must precede and follow 
the events are not only conjoined they are connected 
the cause is more than the prelude the effect is more 
than the sequel of the fact the cause is conceived not 
as a mere occasion it is a power an efficacy which has 
a real operation 

 thus we have drawn from the maxim that every 
effect must have a cause arguments to show that we 
have an idea of cause which is not borrowed from expe 
rience and which involves more than mere succession 
similar arguments might be derived from any other 
maxims of universal and necessary validity which we 
can obtain concerning cause as for example the maxims 
that causes are measured by their effects and that reac 



of the idea of cause 

tion is equal and opposite to action these maxims we 
shall soon have to examine but we may observe here 
that the necessary truth which belongs to them shows 
that they and the ideas they involve are not the mere 
fruits of observation while their meaning containing as 
it does something quite different from the mere concep 
tion of succession of events proves that such a conception 
is far from containing the whole import and signification 
of our idea of cause 

the progress of the opinions of philosophers on the 
points discussed in this chapter has been one of the most 
remarkable parts of the history of metaphysics in modern 
times and i shall therefore briefly notice some of its 
features 



chapter iii 

modern opinions respecting the idea 
of cause 

 towards the end of the seventeenth century there 
existed in the minds of many of the most vigorous and 
active speculators of the european literary world a strong 
tendency to ascribe the whole of our knowledge to the 
teaching of experience this tendency with its conse 
quences including among them the reaction which was 
produced when the tenet had been pushed to a length 
manifestly absurd has exercised a very powerful influence 
upon the progress of metaphysical doctrines up to the 
present time i proceed to notice some of the most 
prominent of the opinions which have thus obtained 
prevalence among philosophers so far as the idea of 
cause is concerned 

locke was one of the metaphysicians who produced 
the greatest effect in diffusing this opinion of the exclusive

dependence of our knowledge upon experience agree 
ably to this general system he taught that our ideas of 
cause and effect are got from observation of the things 
about us yet notwithstanding this tenet of his he 
endeavoured still to employ these ideas in reasoning on 
subjects which are far beyond all limits of experience 
for he professed to prove from our idea of causation 
the existence of the deityf 

hume noticed this obvious inconsistency but declared 
himself unable to discover any remedy for a defect so 
fatal to the most important parts of our knowledge he 
could see in our belief of the succession of cause and 
effect nothing but the habit of associating in our minds 
what had often been associated in our experience he 
therefore maintained that we could not with logical 
propriety extend our belief of such a succession to cases 
entirely distinct from all those of which our experience 
consisted we see he said an actual conjunction of two 
events but we can in no way detect a necessary con 
nexion and therefore we have no means of inferring 
cause from effect or effect from cause the only way 
in which we recognise cause and effect in the field of our 
experience is as an unfailing sequence we look in vain 
for anything which can assure us of an infallible conse 
quence and since experience is the only source of our 
knowledge we cannot with any justice assert that the 
world in which we live must necessarily have had a cause 
 this doctrine taken in conjunction with the known 
scepticism of its author on religious points produced a 
considerable fermentation in the speculative world the 
solution of the difficulty thus thrown before philosophers 
was by no means obvious it was vain to endeavour to 
find in experience any other property of a cause than a

constant sequence of the effect yet it was equally vain 
to try to persuade men that they had no idea of cause 
or even to shake their belief in the cogency of the fami 
liar arguments concerning the necessity of an original 
cause of all that is and happens accordingly these 
hostile and apparently irreconcilable doctrines the in 
dispensable necessity of a cause of every event and the 
impossibility of our knowing such a necessity were at 
last allowed to encamp side by side reid beattie and 
others formed one party who showed how widely and 
constantly the idea of a cause pervades all the processes 
of the human mind while another sect including brown 
and apparently stewart maintained that this idea is 
always capable of being resolved into a constant sequence 
and these latter reasoners tried to obviate the dangerous 
and shocking inferences which some persons might try to 
draw from their opinion by declaring the maxim that 
 every event must have a cause to be an instinctive law 
of belief or a fundamental principle of the human mind 

 while this series of discussions was going on in 
britain a great metaphysical genius in germany was 
unravelling the perplexity in another way kants spe 
culations originated as he informs us in the trains of 
thought to which humes writings gave rise and the 
kritik der reinen vernunft or examination of the pure 
reason was published in with the view of showing 
the true nature of our knowledge 

kants solution of the difficulties just mentioned 
differs materially from that above stated according to 
brown f succession observed and cause inferred the 
memory of past conjunctions of events and the belief of 
similar future conjunctions are facts independent so 
far as we can discover but inseparably combined by a

law of our mental nature according to kant causality 
is an inseparable condition of our experience a con 
nexion in events is requisite to our apprehending them as 
events future occurrences must be connected by causa 
tion as the past have been because we cannot think of 
past present and future without such connexion we 
cannot fix the mind upon occurrences without including 
these occurrences in a series of causes and effects the 
relation of causation is a condition under which we 
think of events as the relations of space are a condition 
under which we see objects 

 on a subject so abstruse it is not easy to make 
our distinctions very clear some of browns illustrations 
appear to approach very near to the doctrine of kant 
thus he says the form of bodies is the relation of 
their elements to each other in space the power of 
bodies is their relation to each other in time yet not 
withstanding such approximations in expression the 
kantian doctrine appears to be different from the views 
of stewart and brown as commonly understood ac 
cording to the scotch philosophers the cause and the 
effect are two things connected in our minds by a law 
of our nature but this view requires us to suppose that 
we can conceive the law to be absent and the course of 
events to be unconnected if we can understand what 
is the special force of this law we must be able to imagine 
what the case would be if the law were nonexisting we 
must be able to conceive a mind which does not connect 
effects with causes the kantian doctrine on the other 
hand teaches that we cannot imagine events liberated 
from the connexion of cause and effect this connexion is 
a condition of our conceiving any real occurrences we 
cannot think of a real sequence of things except as in 
volving the operation of causes in the scotch system 
 lect i p 



opinions respecting the idea of cause 

the past and the future are in their nature independent 
but bound together by a rule in the german system 
they share in a common nature and mutual relation by 
the act of thought which makes them past and future 
in the former doctrine cause is a tie which binds in the 
latter it is a character which pervades and shapes events 
the scotch metaphysicians only assert the universality of 
the relation the german attempts further to explain its 
necessity 

this being the state of the case such illustrations as 
that of dr brown quoted above in which he represents 
cause as a relation of the same kind with form do not 
appear exactly to fit his opinions can the relations of 
figure be properly said to be connected with each other 
by a law of our nature or a tendency of our mental con 
stitution can we ascribe it to a law of our thoughts 
that we believe the three angles of a triangle to be equal 
to two right angles if so we must give the same 
reason for our belief that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space or that three and two are five but will 
any one refer us to an ultimate law of our constitution 
for the belief that three and two are five do we not 
see that they are so as plainly as we see that they are 
three and two can we imagine laws of our constitu 
tion abolished so that three and two shall make some 
thing different from five so that an inclosed space shall 
lie between two straight lines so that the three angles 
of a plane triangle shall be greater than two right angles 
we cannot conceive this if the numbers are three and 
two if the lines are straight if the triangle is a recti 
linear triangle the consequences are inevitable we 
cannot even imagine the contrary we do not want a 
law to direct that things should be what they are the 
relation then of cause and effect being of the same kind 
as the necessary relations of figure and number is not 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

properly spoken of as established in our minds by a spe 
cial law of our constitution for we reject that loose and 
inappropriate phraseology which speaks of the relations of 
figure and number as determined by laws of belief 

 in the present work we accept and adopt as the 
basis of our inquiry concerning our knowledge the exist 
ence of necessary truths concerning causes as there exist 
necessary truths concerning figure and number we find 
such truths universally established and assented to among 
the cultivators of science and among speculative men in 
general all mechanicians agree that reaction is equal 
and opposite to action both when one body presses ano 
ther and when one body communicates motion to another 
all reasoners join in the assertion not only that every 
observed change of motion has had a cause but that every 
change of motion must have a cause here we have cer 
tain portions of substantial and undoubted knowledge 
now the essential point in the view which we must take of 
the idea of cause is this that our view must be such as 
to form a solid basis for our knowledge we have in the 
mechanical sciences certain universal and necessary truths 
on the subject of causes now any view which refers 
our belief in causation to mere experience or habit can 
not explain the possibility of such necessary truths since 
experience and habit can never lead to a perception of 
necessary connexion but a view which teaches us to 
acknowledge axioms concerning cause as we acknow 
ledge axioms concerning space will lead us to look upon 
the science of mechanics as equally certain and universal 
with the science of geometry and will thus materially 
affect our judgment concerning the nature and claims of 
our scientific knowledge 

axioms concerning cause or concerning force which 
as we shall see is a modification of cause will flow from 
an idea of cause just as axioms concerning space and 



 opinions respecting the idea of cause 

number flow from the ideas of space and time and 
thus the propositions which constitute the science of 
mechanics prove that we possess an idea of cause in the 
same sense in which the propositions of geometry and 
arithmetic prove our possession of the ideas of space and 
of time or number 

 the idea of cause like the ideas of space and time 
is a part of the active powers of the mind the relation of 
cause and effect is a relation or condition under which 
events are apprehended which relation is not given by ob 
servation but supplied by the mind itself according to 
the views which explain our apprehension of cause by refer 
ence to habit or to a supposed law of our mental nature 
causal connexion is a consequence of agencies which the 
mind passively obeys but according to the view to which 
we are led this connexion is a result of faculties which 
the mind actively exercises and thus the relation of 
cause and effect is a condition of our apprehending suc 
cessive events a part of the minds constant and universal 
activity a source of necessary truths or to sum all this 
in one phrase a fundamental idea 



chapter iv 

of the axioms which relate to the idea 

of cause 

 cause is an abstract term we have now to ex 
press as well as we can the fundamental character of that 
idea of cause of which we have just proved the exist 
ence this may be done at least for purposes of reason 
ing in this as in former instances by means of axioms 
i shall state the principal axioms which belong to this 
subject referring the reader to his own thoughts for the 
axiomatic evidence which belongs to them 



 philosophy op the mechanical sciences 

but i must first observe that in order to express 
general and abstract truths concerning cause and effect 
these terms cause and effect must be understood in a gene 
ral and abstract manner when one event gives rise to 
another the first event is in common language often 
called the cause and the second the effect thus the 
meeting of two billiard balls may be said to be the 
cause of one of them turning aside out of the path in 
which it was moving for our present purposes how 
ever we must not apply the term cause to such occur 
rences as this meeting and turning but to a certain con 
ception ybree abstracted from all such special eventsand 
considered as a quality or property by which one body 
affects the motion of the other and in like manner in 
other cases cause is to be conceived as some abstract 
quality power or efficacy by which change is produced 
a quality not identical with the events but disclosed by 
means of them not only is this abstract mode of con 
ceiving force and cause useful in expressing the funda 
mental principles of science but it supplies us with the 
only mode by which such principles can be stated in a 
general manner and made to lead to substantial truth and 
real knowledge 

understanding cause therefore in this sense we 
proceed to our axioms 

 first axiom nothing can take place without a 
cause 

every event of whatever kind must have a cause in 
the sense of the term which we have just indicated and 
that it must is a universal and necessary proposition to 
which we irresistibly assent as soon as it is understood 
we believe each appearance to come into existence we 
conceive every change to take place not only with some 
thing preceding it but something by which it is made to 
be what it is an effect without a cause an event with 



axioms which relate to the idea of cause 

out a preceding condition involving the efficacy by which 
the event is produced are suppositions which we cannot 
for a moment admit that the connexion of effect with 
cause is universal and necessary is a universal and con 
stant conviction of mankind it persists in the minds of 
all men undisturbed by all the assaults of sophistry and 
scepticism and as we have seen in the last chapter re 
mains unshaken even when its foundations seem to be 
ruined this axiom expresses to a certain extent our 
idea of cause and when that idea is clearly apprehended 
the axiom requires no proof and indeed admits of none 
which makes it more evident that notwithstanding its 
simplicity it is of use in our speculations we shall here 
after see but in the first place we must consider the 
other axioms belonging to this subject 

 second axiom effects are proportional to their 
causes and causes are measured by their effects 

we have already said that cause is that quality or power 
in the circumstances of each case by which the effect is 
produced and this power an abstract property of the 
condition of things to which it belongs can in no way 
fall directly under the cognisance of the senses cause 
of whatever kind is not apprehended as including objects 
and events which share its nature by being coextensive 
with certain portions of it as space and time are it 
cannot therefore like them be measured by repetition 
of its own parts as space is measured by repetition of 
inches and time by repetition of minutes causes may 
be greater or less as for instance the force of a man is 
greater than the force of a child but how much is the 
one greater than the other how are we to compare 
the abstract conception force in such cases as these 

to this the obvious and only answer is that we must 
compare causes by means of their effects that we must 
compare force by something which force can do the 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

child can lift one fagot the man can lift ten such 
fagots we have here a means of comparison and 
whether or not the rule is to be applied in this manner 
that is by the number of the things operated on a ques 
tion which we shall have to consider hereafter it is clear 
that this form of rule namely a reference to some effect 
or other as our measure is the right because the only 
possible form the cause determines the effect the 
cause being the same the effect must be same the 
connexion of the two is governed by a fixed and invio 
lable rule it admits of no ambiguity every degree of 
intensity in the cause has some peculiar modification of 
the effect corresponding to it hence the effect is an 
unfailing index of the amount of the cause and if it be 
a measurable effect gives a measure of the cause we 
can have no other measure but we need no other for 
this is exact sufficient and complete 

it may be said that various effects are produced by 
the same cause the suns heat melts wax and expands 
quicksilver the force of gravity causes bodies to move 
downwards if they are free and to press down upon their 
supports if they are supported which of the effects is 
to be taken as the measure of heat or of gravity in these 
cases to this we reply that if we had merely different 
states of the same cause to compare any of the effects 
might be taken the suns heat on different days might 
be measured by the expansion of quicksilver or by the 
quantity of wax melted the force of gravity if it were 
different at different places might be measured by the 
spaces through which a given weight would bend an elastic 
support or by the spaces through which a body would 
fall in a given time all these measures are consistent 
with the general character of our idea of cause 

 limitation of the second axiom but there may 
be circumstances in the nature of the case which may 



axioms which relate to the idea of cause 

further determine the kind of effect which we must take 
for the measure of the cause for example if causes are 
conceived to be of such a nature as to be capable of 
addition the effects taken as their measure must conform 
to this condition this is the case with mechanical 
causes the weights of two bodies are the causes of the 
pressure which they exert downwards and these weights 
are capable of addition the weight of the two is the 
sum of the weight of each we are therefore not at 
liberty to say that weights shall be measured by the 
spaces through which they bend a certain elastic support 
except we have first ascertained that the whole weight 
bends it through a space equal to the sum of the inflec 
tions produced by the separate weights without this 
precaution we might obtain inconsistent results two 
weights each of the magnitude as measured by their 
effects might if we took the inflections for the effects 
be together equal to or to by the same kind of mea 
surement for the inflection produced by two weights 
of might for aught we can see beforehand be more 
or less than twice as great as the inflection produced by 
one weight of that forces are capable of addition is 
a condition which limits and as we shall see rigorously 
fixes the kind of effects which are to be taken as their 
measures 

causes which are thus capable of addition are to 
be measured by the repeated addition of equal quantities 
two such causes are equal to each other when they pro 
duce exactly the same effect so far our axiom is applied 
directly but these two causes can be added together 
and being thus added they are double of one of them 
and the cause composed by addition of three such is 
three times as great as the first and so on for any mea 
sure whatever by this means and by this means only 
we have a complete and consistent measure of those 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

causes which are so conceived as to be subject to this 
condition of being added and multiplied 

causes are in the present chapter to be understood 
in the widest sense of the term and the axiom now 
under our consideration applies to them whenever they 
are of such a nature as to admit of any measure at all 
but the cases which we have more particularly in view 
are mechanical causes the causes of the motion and of the 
equilibrium of bodies in these cases forces are con 
ceived as capable of addition and what has been said of 
the measure of causes in such cases applies peculiarly to 
mechanical forces two weights placed together may 
be considered as a single weight equal to the sum of the 
two two pressures pushing a body in the same direc 
tion at the same point are identical in all respects with 
some single pressure their sum pushing in like manner 
and this is true whether or not they put the body in 
motion in the cases of mechanical forces therefore we 
take some certain effect velocity generated or weight 
supported which may fix the unit of force and we then 
measure all other forces by the successive repetition of 
this unit as we measure all spaces by the successive repe 
tition of our unit of lineal measure 

but these steps in the formation of the science of 
mechanics will be further explained when we come to 
follow our axioms concerning cause into their application 
in that science at present we have perhaps sufficiently 
explained the axiom that causes are measured by their 
effects and we now proceed to a third axiom also of 
great importance 

 third axiom reaction is equal and opposite to 
action 

in the case of mechanical forces the action of a 
cause often takes place by an operation of one body 
upon another and in this case the action is always and 



axioms which relate to the idea of cause 

inevitably accompanied by an opposite action if i press 
a stone with my hand the stone presses my hand in 
return if one ball strike another and put it in motion 
the second ball diminishes the motion of the first in 
these cases the operation is mutual the action is accom 
panied by a reaction and in all such cases the reaction 
is a force of exactly of the same nature as the action 
exerted in an opposite direction a pressure exerted 
upon a body at rest is resisted and balanced by another 
pressure when the pressure of one body puts another 
in motion the body though it yields to the force never 
theless exerts upon the pressing body a force like that 
which it suffers 

now the axiom asserts further that this reaction is 
equal as well as opposite to the action for the reaction 
is an effect of the action and is determined by it and 
since the two action and reaction are forces of the same 
nature each may be considered as cause and as effect 
and they must therefore determine each other by a 
common rule but this consideration leads necessarily 
to their equality for since the rule is mutual if we could 
for an instant suppose the reaction to be less than the 
action we must by the same rule suppose the action to 
be less than the reaction and thus action and reac 
tion in every such case are rigorously equal to each other 
it is easily seen that this axiom is not a proposition 
which is or can be proved by experience but that its 
truth is anterior to special observation and depends on 
our conception of action and reaction like our other 
axioms this has its source in an idea namely the idea 
of cause under that particular condition in which cause 
and effect are mutual the necessary and universal 
truth which we cannot help ascribing to the axiom 
shows that it is not derived from the stores of experi 
ence which can never contain truths of this character 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

accordingly it was asserted with equal confidence and 
generality by those who did not refer to experience for 
their principles and by those who did leonicus 
tomseus a commentator of aristotle whose work was 
published in and therefore at a period when no 
right opinions concerning mechanical reaction were 
current at least in his school says in his remarks on the 
authors questions concerning the communication of 
motion that reaction is equal and contrary to action 
the same principle was taken for granted by all parties 
in all the controversies concerning the proper measure of 
force of which we shall have to speak and would be 
rigorously true as a law of motion whichever of the 
rival interpretations of the measure of the term action 
we were to take 

 extent of the third axiom it may naturally be 
asked whether this third axiom respecting causation 
extends to any other cases than those of mechanical 
action since the notion of cause in general has certainly 
a much wider extent for instance when a hot body 
heats a cold one is there necessarily an equal reaction of 
the second body upon the first does the snowball cool 
the boys hand exactly as much as the hand heats the 
snow to this we reply that in every case in which 
one body acts upon another by its physical qualities there 
must be some reaction no body can affect another 
without being itself also affected but in any physical 
change the action exerted is an abstract term which may 
be variously understood the hot hand may melt a cold 
body or may warm it which kind of effect is to be taken 
as action this remains to be determined by other 
considerations 

in all cases of physical change produced by one body 
in another it is generally possible to assume such a 
meaning of action that the reaction shall be of the same 



axioms which relate to the idea of cause 

nature as the action and when this is done the third 
axiom of causation that reaction is equal to action is 
universally true thus if a hot body heat a cold one the 
change may be conceived as the transfer of a certain sub 
stance heat or caloric from the first body to the second 
on this supposition the first body loses just as much 
heat as the other gains action and reaction are equal 
but if the reaction be of a different kind to the action 
we can no longer apply the axiom if a hot body melt 
a cold one the latter cools the former here then is 
reaction but so long as the action and reaction are 
stated in this form we cannot assert any equality between 
them 

in treating of the secondary mechanical sciences we 
shall see further in what way we may conceive the phy 
sical action of one body upon another so that the same 
axioms which are the basis of the science of mechanics shall 
apply to changes not at first sight manifestly mechanical 

the three axioms of causation which we have now 
stated are the fundamental maxims of all reasoning con 
cerning causes as to their quantities and it will be 
shown in the sequel that these axioms form the basis of 
the science of mechanics determining its form extent 
and certainty we must however in the first place 
consider how we acquire those conceptions upon which 
the axioms now established are to be employed 



chapter v 

of the origin of our conceptions of force 
and matter 

 force when the faculties of observation and 
thought are developed in man the idea of causation is

state of rest and motion of bodies around us and 
when our abstract conceptions are thus formed and named 
we become possessed of the term force to denote that 
property which is the cause of motion produced changed 
or prevented this conception is it would seem mainly 
and primarily suggested by our consciousness of the 
exertions by which we put bodies in motion the latin 
and greek words for force vis fb were probably like all 
abstract terms derived at first from some sensible object 
the original meaning of the greek word was a muscle or 
tendon its first application as an abstract term is accord 
ingly to muscular force

then ajax a far heavier stone upheaved 
he whirled it and impressing force intense 
upon the mass dismist it 

the property by which bodies affect each others 
motions was naturally likened to that energy which we 
exert upon them with similar effect and thus the labour 
ing horse the rushing torrent the descending weight the 
elastic bow were said to exert force homer speaks 
of the force of the river fls roraoto and hesiodf of 
the force of the north wind fls aveov fiopeao 

thus mans general notion of force was probably first 
suggested by his muscular exertions that is by an act 
depending upon that muscular sense to which as we 
have already seen the perception of space is mainly due 
and this being the case it will be easily understood that 
the direction of the force thus exerted is perceived by 
the muscular sense at the same time that the force itself 
is perceived and that the direction of any other force is 
understood by comparison with force which man must 
exert to produce the same effect in the same manner as 
force itself is so understood

origin of conceptions of force and matter 

this abstract notion of force long remained in a very 
vague and obscure condition as may be seen by referring 
to the history for the failures of attempts at a science of 
force and motion made by the ancients and their com 
mentators in the middle ages by degrees in modern 
times we see the scientific faculty revive the concep 
tion of force becomes so far distinct and precise that it 
can be reasoned upon in a consistent manner with demon 
strated consequences and a genuine science of mecha 
nics comes into existence the foundations of this 
science are to be found in the axioms concerning causa 
tion which we have already stated these axioms being 
interpreted and fixed in their application by a constant 
reference to observed facts as we shall show but we 
must in the first place consider further those primary 
processes of observation by which we acquire the first 
materials of thought on such subjects 

 matter the conception of force as we have said 
arises with our consciousness of our own muscular exer 
tions but we cannot imagine such exertions without 
also imagining some bodily substance against which they 
are exercised if we press we press something if we 
thrust or throw there must be something to resist the 
thrust or to receive the impulse without body mus 
cular force cannot be exerted and force in general is not 
conceivable 

thus force cannot exist without body on which it 
acts the two conceptions force and matter are coex 
istent and correlative force implies resistance and 
the force is effective only when the resistance is called 
into play if we grasp a stone we have no hold of it 
till the closing of the hand is resisted by the solid texture 
of the stone if we push open a gate we must sur 
mount the opposition which it exerts while turning 
on its hinges however slight the resistance be there 

n 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

must be some resistance or there would be no force 
if we imagine a state of things in which objects do not 
resist our touch they must also cease to be influenced by 
our strength such a state of things we sometimes 
imagine in our dreams and such are the poetical pictures 
of the regions inhabited by disembodied spirits in 
these the figures which appear are conspicuous to the 
eye but impalpable like shadow or smoke and as they 
do not resist the corporeal impressions so neither do 
they obey them the spectator tries in vain to strike 
or to grasp them 

et ni cana vates tenues sine corpore vitas 
admoneat volitare cava sub imagine formae 
irruafc ac frustra ferro diverberet umbras 

the sibyl warns him that there round him fly 
bodiless things but substance to the eye 
else had he pierced those shapes with lifelike face 
and smitten fierce the unresisting space 

neque ilium 

prensantem nequicquam umbras et multa volentem 
dicere preterea vidit 

he grasps her form and clutches but the shade 

such may be the circumstances of the unreal world of 
dreams or of poetical fancies approaching to dreams 
for in these worlds our imaginary perceptions are bound 
by no rigid conditions of force and reaction in such 
cases the mind casts off the empire of the idea of cause 
as it casts off even the still more familiar sway of the 
ideas of space and time but the character of the 
material world in which we live when awake is that we 
have at every instant and at every place force operating 
on matter and matter resisting force 

 solidity from our consciousness of muscular 
exertion we derive as we have seen the conception of 
force and with that also the conception of matter we 
have already shown in a former chapter that the same 



origin of conceptions of force and matter 

part of our frame the muscular system is the organ by 
which we perceive extension and the relations of space 
thus the same organ gives us the perception of body as 
resisting force and as occupying space and by combin 
ing these conditions we have the conception of solid 
extended bodies in reality this resistance is inevitably 
presented to our notice in the very facts from which we 
collect the notion of extension for the action of the 
hand and arm by which we follow the forms of objects 
implies that we apply our fingers to their surface and 
we are stopped there by the resistance which the body 
offers this resistance is precisely that which is requisite 
in order to make us conscious of our muscular effort 
neither touch nor any other mere passive sensation 
could produce the perception of extent as we have 
already urged nor could the muscular sense lead to such 
a perception except the extension of the muscles were 
felt to be resisted and thus the perception of resistance 
enters the mind along with the perception of extended 
bodies all the objects with which we have to do are 
not only extended but solid 

this sense of the term solidity the general property 
of all matter is different to that in which we oppose 
solidity to fluidity we may avoid ambiguity by op 
posing rigid to fluid bodies by solid bodies as w r e now 
speak of them we mean only such as resist the pressure 
which we exert so long as their parts continue in their 
places by fluid bodies we mean those whose parts are 
by a slight pressure removed out of their places a drop 
of water ceases to prevent the contact of our two hands 
not by ceasing to have solidity in this sense but by being 
thrust out of the way if it could remain in its place 
it could not cease to exercise its resistance to our pres 
sure except by ceasing to be matter altogether

 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

the perception of solidity like the perception of 
extension implies an act of the mind as well as an 
impression of the senses as the perception of extension 
implies the idea of space so the perception of solidity 
implies the idea of action and reaction that an idea 
is involved in our knowledge on this subject appears as in 
other instances from this consideration that the convic 
tions of persons even of those who allow of no ground of 
knowledge but experience do in fact go far beyond the 
possible limits of experience thus locke says that the 
bodies which we daily handle hinder by an insurmountable 
force the approach of the parts of our hands that press 
them now it is manifest that our observation can 
never go to this length by our senses we can only 
perceive that bodies resist the greatest actual forces that 
we exert upon them but our conception of force carries 
us further and since so long as the body is there to 
receive the action of the force it must suffer the whole 
of that action and must react as much as it suffers it 
is therefore true that so long as the body remains there 
the force which is exerted upon it can never surmount 
the resistance which the body exercises and thus this 
doctrine that bodies resist the intrusion of other bodies 
by an insurmountable force is in fact a consequence of 
the axiom that the reaction is always equal to the action 

 inertia but this principle of the equality of action 
and reaction appears also in another way not only 
when we exert force upon bodies at rest but when by 
our exertions we put them in motion they react if we 
set a large stone in motion the stone resists for the ope 
ration requires an effort by increasing the effort we 
can increase the effect that is the motion produced but 
the resistance still remains and the greater the stone 
moved the greater is the effort requisite to move it 
 essay b ii c 



origin of conceptions of force and matter 

there is in every case a resistance to motion which shows 
itself not in preventing the motion but in a reciprocal 
force exerted backwards upon the agent by which the 
motion is produced and this resistance resides in 
each portion of matter for it is increased as we 
add one portion of matter to another we can push a 
light boat rapidly through the water but we may go on 
increasing its freight till we are barely able to stir it 
this property of matter then by which it resists the re 
ception of motion or rather by which it reacts and re 
quires an adequate force in order that any motion may 
result is called its inertness or inertia that matter has 
such a property is a conviction flowing from that idea of 
a reaction equal and opposite to the action which the 
conception of all force involves by what laws this 
inertia depends on the magnitude form and material of 
the body must be the subject of our consideration here 
after but that matter has this inertia in virtue of 
which as the matter is greater the velocity which the 
same effort can communicate to it is less is a principle 
inseparable from the notion of matter itself 

hermann says that kepler first introduced this most 
significant word inertia whether it is to be found in 
earlier writers i know not kepler certainly does use it 
familiarly in those attempts to assign physical reasons for 
the motions of the planets which were among the main 
occasions of the discovery of the true laws of mechanics 
he assumes the slowness of the motions of the planets 
to increase other causes remaining the same as the 
inertia increases and though even in this assumption 
there is an error involved if we adopt that interpreta 
tion of the term inertia to which subsequent researches 
led the introduction of such a word was one step in 
determining and expressing those laws of motion which 
depend on the fundamental principle of the equality of 
action and reaction 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

 we have thus seen i trust in a satisfactory 
manner the origin of our conceptions of force matter 
solidity and inertness it has appeared that the organ 
by which we obtain such conceptions is that very mus 
cular frame which is the main instrument of our percep 
tions of space but that besides bodily sensations these 
ideal conceptions like all the others which we have 
hitherto considered involve also an habitual activity of 
the mind giving to our sensations a meaning which they 
could not otherwise possess and among the ideas thus 
brought into play is an idea of action with an equal and 
opposite reaction which forms a foundation for universal 
truths to be hereafter established respecting the concep 
tions thus obtained 

we must now endeavour to trace in what manner 
these fundamental principles and conceptions are un 
folded by means of observation and reasoning till they 
become an extensive yet indisputable science 



chapter vi 

of the establishment of the principles 
of statics 

 object of the chapter in the present and the suc 
ceeding chapters we have to show how the general axioms 
of causation enable us to construct the science of me 
chanics we have to consider these axioms as moulding 
themselves in the first place into certain fundamental 
mechanical principles which are of evident and necessary 
truth in virtue of their dependence upon the general 
axioms of causation and thus as forming a foundation 
for the whole structure of the science a system of truths 
no less necessary than the fundamental principles because 
derived from these by rigorous demonstration 



establishment of the principles of statics 

this account of the construction of the science of 
mechanics however generally treated cannot be other 
wise than technical in its details and will probably be 
imperfectly understood by any one not acquainted with 
mechanics as a mathematical science 

i cannot omit this portion of my survey without 
rendering my work incomplete but i may remark that 
the main purpose of it is to prove in a more particular 
manner what i have already declared in general that 
there are in mechanics no less than in geometry funda 
mental principles of axiomatic evidence and necessity 
that these principles derive their axiomatic character 
from the idea which they involve namely the idea of 
cause and that through the combination of principles 
of this kind the whole science of mechanics including its 
most complex and remote results exists as a body of solid 
and universal truths 

 statics and dynamics we must first turn our 
attention to a technical distinction of mechanics into two 
portions according as the forces about which we reason 
produce rest or motion the former portion is termed 
statics the latter dynamics if a stone fall or a weight 
put a machine in motion the problem belongs to dy 
namics but if the stone rest upon the ground or a 
weight be merely supported by a machine without being 
raised higher the question is one of statics 

 equilibrium in statics forces balance each other 
or keep each other in equilibrium and forces which 
directly balance each other or keep each other in equili 
brium are necessarily and manifestly equal if we see 
two boys pull at two ends of a rope so that neither of 
them in the smallest degree prevails over the other we 
have a case in which two forces are in equilibrium the 
two forces are evidently equal and are a statical exem 
plification of action and reaction such as are spoken of 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

in the third axiom concerning causes now the same 
exemplification occurs in every case of equilibrium no 
point or body can be kept at rest except in virtue of 
opposing forces acting upon it and these forces must 
always be equal in their opposite effect when a stone 
lies on the floor the weight of the stone downwards is 
opposed and balanced by an equal pressure of the floor 
upwards if the stone rests on a slope its tendency to 
slide is counteracted by some equal and opposite force 
arising it may be from the resistance which the sloping 
ground opposes to any motion along its surface every 
case of rest is a case of equilibrium every case of equi 
librium is a case of equal and opposite forces 

the most complex framework on which weights are 
supported as the roof of a building or the cordage of a 
machine are still examples of equilibrium in such 
cases we may have many forces all combining to balance 
each other and the equilibrium will depend on various 
conditions of direction and magnitude among the forces 
and in order to understand what are these conditions we 
must ask in the first place what we understand by the 
magnitude of such forces what is the measure of 
statical forces 

 measure of statical forces at first we might 
expect perhaps that since statical forces come under the 
general notion of cause the mode of measuring them 
would be derived from the second axiom of causation 
that causes are measured by their effects but we find 
that the application of this axiom is controlled by the 
limitation which we noticed after stating that axiom 
namely the condition that the causes shall be capable of 
addition further as we have seen a statical force pro 
duces no other effect than this that it balances some other 
statical force and hence the measure of statical forces is 
necessarily dependent upon their balancing that is upon 
the equality of action and reaction 



establishment of the principles of statics 

that statical forces are capable of addition is involved 
in our conception of such forces when two men pull 
at a rope in the same direction the forces which they 
exert are added together when two heavy bodies are 
put into a basket suspended by a string their weights are 
added and the sum is supported by the string 

combining these considerations it will appear that 
the measure of statical forces is necessarily given at once 
by the fundamental principle of the equality of action 
and reaction since two opposite forces which balance 
each other are equal each force is measured by that 
which it balances and since forces are capable of addi 
tion a force of any magnitude is measured by adding to 
gether a proper number of such equal forces thus a heavy 
body which appended to some certain elastic branch of a 
tree would bend it down through one inch may be taken 
as a unit of weight then if we remove this first body 
and find a second heavy body which will also bend the 
branch through the same space this is also a unit of 
weight and in like manner we might go on to a third 
and a fourth equal body and adding together the two 
or the three or the four heavy bodies we have a force 
twice or three times or four times the unit of weight 
and with such a collection of heavy bodies or weights we 
can readily measure all other forces for the same prin 
ciple of the equality of action and reaction leads at once 
to this maxim that any statical force is measured by the 
weight which it would support 

as has been said it might at first have been supposed 
that we should have to apply in this case the axiom that 
causes are measured by their effects in another manner 
that thus if that body were a unit of weight which bent 
the bough of a tree through one inch that body would be 
two units which bent it through two inches and so on 
but as we have already stated the measures of weight 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

must be subject to this condition that they are susceptible 
of being added and therefore we cannot take the deflex 
ion of the bough for our measure till we have ascertained 
that which experience alone can teach us that under the 
burden of two equal weights the deflexion will be twice as 
great as it is with one weight which is not true or at 
least is neither obviously nor necessarily true in this 
as in all other cases although causes must be measured 
by their effects we learn from experience only how the 
effects are to be interpreted so as to give a true and 
consistent measure 

with regard however to the measure of statical 
force and of weight no difficulty really occurred to phi 
losophers from the time when they first began to specu 
late on such subjects for it was easily seen that if we 
take any uniform material as wood or stone or iron por 
tions of this which are geometrically equal must also be 
equal in statical effect for this was implied in the very 
hypothesis of a uniform material and a body ten times 
as large as another of the same substance will be of ten 
times the weight but before men could establish by 
reasoning the conditions under which weights would be in 
equilibrium some other principles were needed in addi 
tion to the mere measure of forces the principles in 
troduced for this purpose still resulted from the concep 
tion of equal action and reaction but it required no 
small clearness of thought to select them rightly and to 
employ them successfully this however was done to a 
certain extent by the greeks and the treatise of archi 
medes on the centre of gravity is founded on principles 
which may still be considered as the genuine basis of sta 
tical reasoning i shall make a few remarks on the most 
important principle among those which archimedes thus 
employs 

 he centre of gravity the most important of 



establishment of the principles of statics 

the principles which enter into the demonstration of 
archimedes is this that every body has a centre of 
gravity meaning by the centre of gravity a point at 
which the whole matter of the body may be supposed to 
be collected to all intents and purposes of statical 
reasoning this principle has been put in various forms 
by succeeding writers for instance it has been thought 
sufficient to assume a case much simpler than the general 
one and to assert that two equal bodies have their 
centre of gravity in the point midway between them it 
is to be observed that this assertion not only implies 
that the two bodies will balance upon a support placed 
at that midway point but also that they will exercise 
upon such a support a pressure equal to their sum 
for this point being the centre of gravity the whole 
matter of the two bodies may be conceived to be col 
lected there and therefore the whole weight will press 
there and thus the principle in question amounts to 
this that when two equal heavy bodies are supported on the 
middle point between them the pressure upon the support is 
equal to the sum of the weights of the bodies 

a clear understanding of the nature and grounds of 
this principle is of great consequence for in it we have 
the foundation of a large portion of the science of 
mechanics and if this principle can be shown to be 
necessarily true in virtue of our fundamental ideas we 
can hardly doubt that there exist many other truths of 
the same kind and that no sound view of the evidence 
and extent of human knowledge can be obtained so long 
as we mistake the nature of these its first principles 

the above principle that the pressure on the support 
is equal to the sum of the bodies supported is often 
stated as an axiom in the outset of books on mechanics 
and this appears to be the true place and character of 
this principle in accordance with the reasonings which 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

we have already urged the axiom depends upon our 
conception of action and reaction that the two weights 
are supported implies that the supporting force must be 
equal to the force or weight supported 

in order further to show the foundation of this 
principle we may ask the question i it be not an 
axiom deriving its truth from the fundamental concep 
tion of equal action and reaction which equilibrium 
always implies what is the origin of its certainty the 
principle is never for an instant denied or questioned it is 
taken for granted even before it is stated no one will 
doubt that it is not only true but true with the same 
rigour and universality as the axioms of geometry will 
it be said that it is borrowed from experience expe 
rience could never prove a principle to be universally and 
rigorously true moreover when from experience we 
prove a proposition to possess great exactness and 
generality we approach by degrees to this proof the 
conviction becomes stronger the truth more secure as 
we accumulate trials but nothing of this kind is the 
case in the instance before us there is no gradation 
from less to greater certainty no hesitation which 
precedes confidence from the first we know that the 
axiom is exactly and certainly true in order to be 
convinced of it we do not require many trials but 
merely a clear understanding of the assertion itself 

but in fact not only are trials not necessary to the 
proof but they do not strengthen it probably no 
one ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that 
the pressure upon the support is equal to the sum of the 
two weights certainly no person with clear mechanical 
conceptions ever wanted such a trial to convince him of 
the truth or thought the truth clearer after the trial 
had been made if to such a person an experiment 
were shown which seemed to contradict the principle his 



establishment of the principles of statics 

conclusion would be not that the principle was doubtful 
but that the apparatus was out of order nothing can 
be less like collecting truth from experience 

we maintain then that this equality of mechanical 
action and reaction is one of the principles which do 
not flow from but regulate our experience to this 
principle the facts which we observe must conform 
and we cannot help interpreting them in such a manner 
that they shall be exemplifications of the principle a 
mechanical pressure not accompanied by an equal and 
opposite pressure can no more be given by experience 
than two unequal right angles with the supposition of 
such inequalities space ceases to be space force ceases to 
be force matter ceases to be matter and this equality 
of action and reaction considered in the case in which 
two bodies are connected so as to act on a single support 
leads to the axiom which we have stated above and 
which is one of the main foundations of the science of 
mechanics 

 oblique forces by the aid of this axiom and a 
few others the greeks made some progress in the 
science of statics but after a short advance they 
arrived at another difficulty that of oblique forces 
which they never overcame and which no mathematician 
mastered till modern times the unpublished manuscripts 
of leonardo da vinci written in the fifteenth century 
and the works of stevinus and galileo in the sixteenth 
are the places in which we find the first solid grounds of 
reasoning on the subject of forces acting obliquely to 
each other and mathematicians having thus become 
possessed of all the mechanical principles which are 
requisite in problems respecting equilibrium soon framed 
a complete science of statics succeeding writers pre 
sented this science in forms variously modified for it 
was found in mechanics as in geometry that various 



 philosophy op the mechanical sciences 

propositions might be taken as the starting points and 
that the collection of truths which it was the mecha 
nicians business to include in his course might be 
traversed by various routes each path offering a series 
of satisfactory demonstrations the fundamental con 
ceptions of force and resistance like those of space and 
number could be contemplated under different aspects 
each of which might be made the basis of axioms 
or of principles employed as axioms hence the 
grounds of the truth of statics may be stated in various 
ways and it would be a task of some length to examine 
all these completely and to trace them to their funda 
mental ideas this i shall not undertake here to do 
but the philosophical importance of the subject makes it 
proper to offer a few remarks on some of the main 
principles involved in the different modes of presenting 
statics as a rigorously demonstrated science 

 a force may be supposed to act at any point of its 
direction it has been stated in the history of mechanics 
that leonardo da vinci and galileo obtained the true 
measure of the effect of oblique forces by reasonings 
which were in substance the same the principle of 
these reasonings is that expressed at the head of this 
paragraph and when we have a little accustomed our 
selves to contemplate our conceptions of force and its 
action on matter in an abstract manner we shall have 
no difficulty in assenting to the principle in this general 
form but it may perhaps be more obvious at first in a 
special case 

if we suppose a wheel moveable about its axis and 
carrying with it in its motion a weight as for example 
one of the wheels by means of which the large bells of a 
church are rung this weight may be supported by means 
of a rope not passing along the circumference of the wheel 

 hist ind c ii pp and 



establishment of the principles op statics 

as is usual in the case of bells but fastened to one of 
the spokes of the wheel now the principle which is 
enunciated above asserts that if the rope pass in a 
straight line across several of the spokes of the wheel it 
makes no difference in the mechanical effect of the force 
applied for the purpose of putting the bell in motion to 
which of these spokes the rope is fastened in each case 
fastening the rope to the wheel merely serves to enable 
the force to produce motion about the centre and so long 
as the force acts in the same line the effect is the same 
at whatever point of the rope the line of action finishes 

this axiom very readily aids us in estimating the 
effect of oblique forces for when a force acts on one of 
the arms of a lever at any oblique angle we suppose 
another arm projecting from the centre of motion like 
another spoke of the same wheel so situated that it is 
perpendicular to the force this arm we may with 
leonardo call the virtual lever for by the axiom we 
may suppose the force to act where the line of its direction 
meets this arm and thus we reduce the case to that in 
which the force acts perpendicularly on the arm 

the ground of this axiom is that matter in statics 
is necessarily conceived as transmitting force that force 
can be transmitted from one place to another by means 
of matter that we can push with a rod pull with a 
rope are suppositions implied in our conceptions of 
force and matter matter is as we have said that which 
receives the impression of force and the modes just 
mentioned are the simplest ways in which that impression 
operates and since in any of these cases the force 
might be resisted by a reaction equal to the force itself 
the reaction in each case would be equal and therefore 
the action in each case is necessarily equal and thus the 
forces must be transmitted from one point to another 
without increase or diminution 

vol i o 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

this property of matter of transmitting the action of 
force is of various kinds we have the coherence of a 
rope which enables us to pull and the rigidity of a staff 
which enables us to push with it in the direction of its 
length and again the same staff has a rigidity of another 
kind in virtue of which we can use it as a lever that is a 
rigidity to resist flexure and to transmit the force which 
turns a body round a fulcrum there is further the 
rigidity by which a solid body resists twisting of these 
kinds of rigidity the first is that to which our axiom 
refers but in order to complete the list of the ele 
mentary principles of statics we ought also to lay down 
axioms respecting the other kinds of rigidity these 
however i shall not here state as they do not involve 
any new principle like the one just considered they 
form part of our fundamental conception of matter they 
are not the results of any experience but are the hypo 
theses to which we are irresistibly led when we would 
liberate our reasonings concerning force and matter from 
a dependence on the special results of experience we 
cannot even conceive that is if we have any clear 
mechanical conceptions at all the force exerted by the 
point of a staff and resisting the force which we steadily 
impress on the head of it to be different from the 
impressed force 

 forces may have equivalent forces substituted for 
them the parallelogram of forces it has already been 
observed that in order to prove the doctrines of statics 
we may take various principles as our starting points 
and may still find a course of demonstration by which 
the leading propositions belonging to the subject may 
be established thus instead of beginning our reason 
ings as in the last section we supposed them to 

 such axioms are given in a little work the mechanical euclid 
which i published on the elements of mechanics 



establishment of the principles of statics 

commence with the case in which forces act upon 
different points of the same body in the same line of 
force and counteract each other in virtue of the inter 
vening matter by which the effect of force is transferred 
from one point to another we may suppose different 
forces to act at the same point and may thus commence 
our reasonings with a case in which we have to con 
template force without having to take into our account 
the resistance or rigidity of matter two statical forces 
thus acting at a mathematical point are equivalent in 
all respects to some single force acting at the same point 
and would be kept in equilibrium by a force equal and 
opposite to that single force and the rule by which 
the single force is derived from the two is commonly 
termed the parallelogram of forces the proposition being 
this that if the two forces be represented in magnitude 
and direction by the two sides of a parallelogram the 
resulting force will be represented in the same manner 
by the diagonal of the parallelogram this proposition 
has very frequently been made by modern writers the 
commencement of the science of mechanics a position 
for which by its simplicity it is well suited although 
in order to deduce from it the other elementary proposi 
tions of the science as for instance those respecting the 
lever we require the axiom stated in the last section 
 the parallelogram of forces is a necessary truth 

in the series of discussions in which we are here 

engaged our main business is to ascertain the nature and 
grounds of the certainty of scientific truths we have 
therefore to ask whether this proposition the parallelo 
gram of forces be a necessary truth and if so on what 
grounds its necessity ultimately rests we shall find 
that this like the other fundamental doctrines of statics 
justly claims a demonstrative certainty daniel ber 
noulli in gave the first proof of this important 

o 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

proposition on pure statical principles and thus as lie 
says proved that statical theorems are not less 
necessarily true than geometrical are if we examine 
this proof of bernoulli in order to discover what are the 
principles on which it rests we shall find that the 
reasoning employs in its progress such axioms as this 
that if from forces which are in equilibrium at a point 
be taken away other forces which are in equilibrium at 
the same point the remainder will be in equilibrium 
and generally that if forces can be resolved into other 
equivalent forces these may be separated grouped and 
recombined in any new manner and the result will still 
be identical with what it was at first thus in ber 
noullis proof the two forces to be compounded are repre 
sented by p and q p is resolved into two other forces x 
and u and q into two others y and v under certain 
conditions it is then assumed that these forces may be 
grouped into the pairs x y and u v and when it has 
been shown that x and y are in equilibrium they may by 
what has been said be removed and the forces p q are 
equivalent to u v which being in the same direction by 
the course of the construction have a result equal to 
their sum 

it is clear that the principles here assumed are 
genuine axioms depending upon our conception of the 
nature of equivalence of forces and upon their being 
capable of addition and composition if the forces p q 
be equivalent to forces x u y v they are equivalent to 
these forces added and compounded in any order just as 
a geometrical figure is by our conception of space 
equivalent to its parts added together in any order the 
apprehension of forces as having magnitude as made 
up of parts as capable of composition leads to such 
axioms in statics in the same manner as the like 

 comm petrop vol i 



establishment of the principles of statics 

apprehension of space leads to the axioms of geometry 
and thus the truths of statics resting upon such foun 
dations are independent of experience in the same 
manner in which geometrical truths are so 

the proof of the parallelogram of forces thus given 
by daniel bernoulli as it was the first is also one of 
the most simple proofs of that proposition which have 
been devised up to the present day many other 
demonstrations however have been given of the same

ship while the ship moves through the water has con 
stantly been confounded with the composition of force 
but though this has been done by very eminent mathe 
maticians it is quite necessary for us to keep the two 
subjects distinct in order to see the real nature of the 
evidence of truth in either case the conditions of 
equilibrium of two forces on a lever or of three forces at 
a point can be established without any reference what 
ever to any motions which the forces might under other 
circumstances produce and because this can be done 
to do so is the only scientific procedure to prove 
such propositions by any other course would be to 
support truth by extraneous and inconclusive reasons 
which would be foreign to our purpose since we seek 
not only knowledge but the grounds of our knowledge 

 the centre of gravity seeks the lowest place the 
principles which we have already mentioned afford a 
sufficient basis for the science of statics in its most 
extensive and varied applications and the conditions of 
equilibrium of the most complex combinations of ma 
chinery may be deduced from these principles with a 
rigour not inferior to that of geometry but in some of the 
more complex cases the results of long trains of reasoning 
may be foreseen in virtue of certain maxims which 
appear to us selfevident although it may not be easy to 
trace the exact dependence of these maxims upon our fun 
damental conceptions of force and matter of this nature 
is the maxim now stated that in any combination of 
matter any how supported the centre of gravity will 
descend into the lowest position which the connexion of 
the parts allows it to assume by descending it is easily 
seen that this maxim carries to a much greater extent 
the principle which the greek mathematicians assumed 
that every body has a centre of gravity that is a point 
in which if the whole matter of the body be collected 



establishment of the principles of statics 

the effect will remain unchanged for the greeks 
asserted this of a single rigid mass only whereas in the 
maxim now under our notice it is asserted of any masses 
connected by strings rods joints or in any manner 
we have already seen that more modern writers on 
mechanics desirous of assuming as fundamental no wider 
principles than are absolutely necessary have not adopted 
the greek axiom in all its generality but have only 
asserted that two equal weights have a centre of gravity 
midway between them yet the principle that every 
body however irregular has a centre of gravity and will 
be supported if that centre is supported and not otherwise 
is so far evident that it might be employed as a funda 
mental truth if we could not resolve it into any simpler 
truths and historically speaking it was assumed as 
evident by the greeks in like manner the still wider 
principle that a collection of bodies as for instance a 
flexible chain hanging upon one or more supports has a 
centre of gravity and that this point will descend to the 
lowest possible situation as a single body would do has 
been adopted at various periods in the history of mechan 
ics and especially at conjunctures when mathematical 
philosophers have had new and difficult problems to con 
tend with for in almost every instance it has only 
been by repeated struggles that philosophers have reduced 
the solution of such problems to a clear dependence upon 
the most simple axioms 

 stevinuss proof for oblique forces we have 
an example of this mode of dealing with problems in 
stevinuss mode of reasoning concerning the inclined 
plane which as we have stated in the history of 
mechanics was the first correct published solution of 
that problem stevinus supposes a loop of chain or a 
loop of string loaded with a series of equal balls at 
equal distances to hang over the inclined plane and 
his reasoning proceeds upon this assumption that 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

such a loop so hanging will find a certain position in 
which it will rest for otherwise says he its motion 
must go on for ever which is absurd it may be asked 
how this absurdity of a perpetual motion appears and it 
will perhaps be added that although the impossibility of 
a machine with such a condition may be proved as a 
remote result of mechanical principles this impossibility 
can hardly be itself recognised as a selfevident truth 
but to this we may reply that the impossibility is really 
evident in the case contemplated by stevinus for we 
cannot conceive a loop of chain to go on through all 
eternity sliding round and round upon its support by the 
effect of its own weight and the ground of our convic 
tion that this cannot be seems to be this consideration 
that when the chain moves by the effect of its weight we 
consider its motion as the result of an effort to reach some 
certain position in which it can rest just as a single ball 
in a bowl moves till it comes to rest at the lowest point 
of the bowl such an effect of weight in the chain we 
may represent to ourselves by conceiving all the matter 
of the chain to be collected in one single point and this 
single heavy point to hang from the support in some way 
or other so as fitly to represent the mode of support of 
the chain in whatever manner this heavy point the 
centre of gravity of the chain be supported and con 
trolled in its movements there will still be some position 
of rest which it will seek and find and thus there will 
be some corresponding position of rest for the chain and 
the interminable shifting from one position to another 
with no disposition to rest in any position cannot exist 

thus the demonstration of the property of the 
inclined plane by stevinus depends upon a principle 
which though far from being the simplest of those to 
which the case can be reduced is still both true and 
evident and the evidence of this principle depending

upon the assumption of a centre of gravity is of the same 
nature as the evidence of the greek statical demonstra 
tions the earliest real advances in the science 

 principle of virtual velocities we have 
referred above to an assertion often made that we 
may from the simple principles of mechanics demon 
strate the impossibility of a perpetual motion in reality 
however the simplest proof of that impossibility in 
a machine acted upon by weight only arises from the 
very maxim above stated that the centre of gravity seeks 
and finds the lowest place or from some similar pro 
position for if as is done by many writers we profess 
to prove the impossibility of a perpetual motion by means 
of that proposition which includes the conditions of equi 
librium and is called the principle of virtual velocities 
we are under the necessity of first proving in a general 
manner that principle and if this be done by a mere 
enumeration of cases as by taking those five cases which 
are called the mechanical powers there may remain some 
doubts whether the enumeration of possible mechanical 
combinations be complete accordingly some writers 
have attempted independent and general proofs of the 
principle of virtual velocities and these proofs rest 
upon assumptions of the same nature as that now under 
notice this is for example the case with lagranges 
proof which depends upon what he calls the principle 
of pulleys for this principle is that a weight any how 
supported as by a string passing round any number of 
pulleys any how placed will be at rest then only when 
it cannot get lower by any small motion of the pulleys 
and thus the maxim that a weight will descend if it can 
is assumed as the basis of this proof 

there is as we have said no need to assume such 
principles as these for the foundation of our mechanical 
science but it is on various accounts useful to direct 
 sec hist ind scl 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

our attention to those cases in which truths apprehended 
at first in a complex and derivative form have afterwards 
been reduced to their simpler elements in which also 
sagacious and inventive men have fixed upon those 
truths as selfevident which now appear to us only cer 
tain in virtue of demonstration in these cases we can 
hardly doubt that such men were led to assert the doc 
trines which they discovered not by any capricious con 
jecture or arbitrary selection but by having a keener 
and deeper insight than other persons into the relations 
which were the object of their contemplation and in the 
science now spoken of they were led to their assumptions 
by possessing clearly and distinctly the conceptions of 
mechanical cause and effect action and reaction force 
and the nature of its operation 

 fluids press equally in all directions the doc 
trines which concern the equilibrium of fluids depend on 
principles no less certain and simple than those which 
refer to the equilibrium of solid bodies and the greeks 
who as we have seen obtained a clear view of some of 
the principles of statics also made a beginning in the 
kindred subject of hydrostatics we still possess a trea 
tise of archimedes on floating bodies which contains 
correct solutions of several problems belonging to this 
subject and of some which are by no means easy in 
this treatise the fundamental assumption is of this kind 
 let it be assumed that the nature of a fluid is such 
that the parts which are less pressed yield to those which 
are more pressed in this assumption or axiom it is 
implied that a pressure exerted upon a fluid in one direc 
tion produces a pressure in another direction thus the 
weight of the fluid which arises from a downward force 
produces a lateral pressure against the sides of the con 
taining vessel not only does the pressure thus diverge 
from its original direction into all other directions but it 
is in all directions exactly equal an equal extent of the 



establishment of the principles of statics 

fluid being taken this principle which was involved in 
the reasoning of archimedes is still to the present day 
the basis of all hydrostatical treatises and is expressed 
as above by saying that fluids press equally in all direc 
tions 

concerning this as concerning previouslynoticed 
principles we have to ask whether it can rightly be said 
to be derived from experience and to this the answer 
must still be as in the former cases that the proposition 
is not one borrowed from experience in any usual or exact 
sense of the phrase i will endeavour to illustrate this 
there are many elementary propositions in physics our 
knowledge of which indisputably depends upon expe 
rience and in these cases there is no difficulty in seeing 
the evidence of this dependence in such cases the ex 
periments which prove the law are prominently stated in 
treatises upon the subject they are given with exact 
measures and with an account of the means by which 
errors were avoided the experiments of more recent 
times have either rendered more certain the law ori 
ginally asserted or have pointed out some correction of 
it as requisite and the names both of the discoverers of 
the law and of its subsequent reformers are well known 
for instance the proposition that the elastic force of air 
varies as the density was first proved by boyle by means 
of operations of which the detail is given in his defence 
of his pneumatical experiments and by marriotte in his 
traite de vequilibre des liquides from whom it has gene 
rally been termed marriottes law after being confirmed 
by many other experimenters this law was suspected to 
be slightly inaccurate and a commission of the french 
academy of sciences was appointed consisting of several 
distinguished philosophers to ascertain the truth or false 

 shaws boyle vol ii p 

t the members were prony arago ampere girard and dulong 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

hood of this suspicion the result of their investigations 
appeared to be that the law is exact as nearly as the 
inevitable inaccuracies of machinery and measures will 
allow us to judge here we have an example of a law 
which is of the simplest kind and form and which yet is 
not allowed to rest upon its simplicity or apparent proba 
bility but is rigorously tested by experience in this 
case the assertion that the law depends upon experience 
contains a reference to plain and notorious passages in the 
history of science 

now with regard to the principle that fluids press 
equally in all directions the case is altogether different 
it is indeed often asserted in works on hydrostatics that 
the principle is collected from experience and sometimes 
a few experiments are described as exhibiting its effect 
but these are such as to illustrate and explain rather 
than to prove the truth of the principle they are never 
related to have been made with that exactness of pre 
caution and measurement or that frequency of repetition 
which are necessary to establish a purely experimental 
truth nor did such experiments occur as important 
steps in the history of science it does not appear that 
archimedes thought experiment necessary to confirm the 
truth of the law as he employed it on the contrary he 
states it in exactly the same shape as the axioms which 
he employs in statics and even in geometry namely as 
an assumption nor does any intelligent student of the 
subject find any difficulty in assenting to this fundamental 
principle of hydrostatics as soon as it is propounded to 
him experiment was not requisite for its discovery 
experiment is not necessary for its proof at present and 

the experiments were extended to a pressure of twentyseven atmo 
spheres and in no instance did the difference between the observed 
and calculated elasticity amount to onehundredth of the whole nor 
did the difference appear to increase with the increase of pressure

we may add that experiment though it may make the 
proposition more readily intelligible can add nothing to 
our conviction of its truth when it is once understood 

 foundation of the above axiom but it will 
naturally be asked what then is the ground of our 
conviction of this doctrine of the equal pressure of a 
fluid in all directions and to this i reply that the 
reasons of this conviction are involved in our idea of a 
fluid which is considered as matter and therefore as 
capable of receiving resisting and transmitting force 
according to the general conception of matter and which 
is also considered as matter which has its parts perfectly 
moveable among one another for it follows from these 
suppositions that if the fluid be confined a pressure 
which thrusts in one side of the containing vessel may 
cause any other side to bulge outwards if there be a part 
of the surface which has not strength to resist this pressure 
from within and that this pressure when thus trans 
ferred into a direction different from the original one is 
not altered in intensity depends upon this consideration 
that any difference in the two pressures would be consi 
dered as a defect of perfect fluidity since the fluidity 
would be still more complete if this entire and undimi 
nished transmission of pressure in all directions were 
supposed if for instance the lateral pressure were less 
than the vertical this could be conceived no other way 
than as indicating some rigidity or adhesion of the parts 
of the fluid when the fluidity is perfect the two pres 
sures which act in the two different parts of the fluid 
exactly balance each other they are the action and the 
reaction and must hence be equal by the same necessity 
as two directly opposite forces in statics 

but it may be urged that even if we grant that this 
conception of a perfect fluid as a body which has its parts 
perfectly moveable among each other leads us necessarily 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

to the principle of the equality of hydrostatic pressure in 
all directions still this conception itself is obtained from 
experience or suggested by observation and to this we 
may reply that the conception of a fluid as contemplated 
in mechanical theory cannot be said to be derived from 
experience except in the same manner as the conception 
of a solid and rigid body may be said to be acquired by 
experience for if we imagine a vessel full of small 
smooth spherical balls such a collection of balls would 
approach to the nature of a fluid in having its parts 
moveable among each other and would approach to per 
fect fluidity as the balls became smoother and smaller 
and such a collection of balls would also possess the sta 
tical properties of a fluid for it would transmit pressure 
out of a vertical into a lateral or any other direction in 
the same manner as a fluid would do and thus a col 
lection of solid bodies has the same property which a 
fluid has and the science of hydrostatics borrows from 
experience no principles beyond those which are involved 
in the science of statics respecting solids and since in 
this latter portion of science as we have already seen 
none of the principles depend for their evidence upon any 
special experience the doctrines of hydrostatics also are 
not proved by experience but have a necessary truth 
borrowed from the relations of our ideas 

it is hardly to be expected that the above reasoning 
will at first sight produce conviction in the mind of the 
reader except he have to a certain extent acquainted 
himself with the elementary doctrines of the science of 
hydrostatics as usually delivered and have followed 
with clear and steady apprehension some of the trains of 
reasoning by which the pressures of fluids are deter 
mined as for instance the explanation of what is called 
the hydrostatic paradox the necessity of such a dis 
cipline in order that the reader may enter fully into this

part of our speculations naturally renders them less 
popular but this disadvantage is inevitable in our plan 
we cannot expect to throw light upon philosophy by 
means of the advances which have been made in the 
mathematical and physical sciences except we really 
understand the doctrines which have been firmly esta 
blished in those sciences this preparation for philoso 
phizing may be somewhat laborious but such labour is 
necessary if we would pursue speculative truth with all 
the advantages which the present condition of human 
knowledge places within our reach 

we may add that the consequences to which we are 
directed by the preceding opinions are of very great im 
portance in their bearing upon our general views respect 
ing human knowledge i trust to be able to show that 
some important distinctions are illustrated some perplex 
ing paradoxes solved and some large anticipations of the 
future extension of our knowledge suggested by means of 
the conclusions to which the preceding discussions have 
conducted us but before i proceed to these general 
topics i must consider the foundations of some of the 
remaining portions of mechanics 



chapter vii 

of the establishment of the principles 
of dynamics 

 in the history of mechanics i have traced the 
steps by which the three laws of motion and the other 
principles of mechanics were discovered established and 
extended to the widest generality of form and applica 
tion we have in these laws examples of principles 
which were historically speaking obtained by reference 
to experience bearing in mind the object and the re 
sult of the preceding discussions we cannot but turn 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

with much interest to examine these portions of science 
to inquire whether there be any real difference in the 
grounds and nature between the knowledge thus obtained 
and those truths which we have already contemplated 
and which as we have seen contain their own evidence 
and do not require proof from experiment 

 the first law of motion the first law of motion 
is that when a body moves not acted upon by any 
force it will go on perpetually in a straight line and 
with a uniform velocity now what is the real ground 
of our assent to this proposition that it is not at first 
sight a selfevident truth appears to be clear since from 
the time of aristotle to that of galileo the opposite 
assertion was held to be true and it was believed that 
all bodies in motion had by their own nature a constant 
tendency to move more and more slowly so as to stop at 
last this belief indeed is probably even now enter 
tained by most persons till their attention is fixed upon 
the arguments by which the first law of motion is esta 
blished it is however not difficult to lead any person 
of a speculative habit of thought to see that the retarda 
tion which constantly takes place in the motion of all 
bodies when left to themselves is in reality the effect of 
extraneous forces which destroy the velocity a top 
ceases to spin because the friction against the ground and 
the resistance of the air gradually diminish its motion 
and not because its motion has any internal principle of 
decay or fatigue this may be shown and was in fact 
shown by hooke before the royal society at the time 
when the laws of motion were still under discussion by 
means of experiments in which the weight of the top is 
increased and the resistance to motion offered by its sup 
port is diminished for by such contrivances its motion is 
made to continue much longer than it would otherwise 
do and by experiments of this nature although we can 
never remove the whole of the external impediments to 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

continued motion and although consequently there will 
always be some retardation and an end of the motion of 
a body left to itself however long it may be delayed must 
at last come yet we can establish a conviction that if all 
resistance could be removed there would be no diminution 
of velocity and thus the motion would go on for ever 

if we call to mind the axioms which we formerly stated 
as containing the most important conditions involved in 
the idea of cause it will be seen that our conviction 
in this case depends upon the first axiom of causation 
that nothing can happen without a cause every change 
in the velocity of the moving body must have a cause 
and if the change can in any manner be referred to the 
presence of other bodies these are said to exert force upon 
the moving body and the conception of force is thus 
evolved from the general idea of cause force is any 
cause which has motion or change of motion for its effect 
and thus all the change of velocity of a body which can 
be referred to extraneous bodies as the air which sur 
rounds it or the support on which it rests is considered 
as the effect of forces and this consideration looked 
upon as explaining the difference between the motion 
which really takes place in the experiment and that 
which as the law asserts would take place if the body 
were not acted on by any forces 

thus the truth of the first law of motion depends 
upon the axiom that no change can take place without a 
cause and follows from the definition of force if we sup 
pose that there can be none but an external cause of change 
but in order to establish the law it was necessary further 
to be assured that there is no internal cause of change of 
velocity belonging to all matter whatever and operating 
in such a manner that the mere progress of time is suffi 
cient to produce a diminution of velocity in all moving 
bodies it appears from the history of mechanical science 

vol i p 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

that this latter step required a reference to observation 
and experiment and that the first law of motion is so 
far historically at least dependent upon our experience 

but notwithstanding this historical evidence of the 
need which we have of a reference to observed facts in 
order to place this first law of motion out of doubt it has 
been maintained by very eminent mathematicians and 
philosophers that the law is in truth evident of itself 
and does not really rest upon experimental proof such 
for example is the opinion of dalembert who offers 
what is called an a priori proof of this law that is a 
demonstration derived from our ideas alone when a 
body is put in motion either he says the cause which 
puts it in motion at first suffices to make it move one 
foot or the continued action of the cause during this foot 
is requisite for the motion in the first case the same 
reason which made the body proceed to the end of the first 
foot will hold for its going on through a second a third 
a fourth foot and so on for any number in the second 
case the same reason which made the force continue to act 
during the first foot will hold for its acting and therefore 
for the body moving during each succeeding foot and 
thus the body once beginning to move must go on 
moving for ever 

it is obvious that we might reply to this argument 
that the reasons for the body proceeding during each 
succeeding foot may not necessarily be all the same for 
among these reasons may be the time which has elapsed 
and thus the velocity may undergo a change as the time 
proceeds and we require observation to inform us that 
it does not do so 

professor playfair has presented nearly the same argu 
ment although in a different and more mathematical 
formf if the velocity change says he it must change 

 dynamique t outlines c p 



establishment op the principles of dynamics 

according to some expression of calculation depending 
upon the time or in mathematical language must be a 
function of the time if the velocity diminish as the 
time increases this may be expressed by stating the 
velocity in each case as a certain number from which 
another quantity or term increasing as the time increases 
is subtracted but playfair adds there is no condition 
involved in the nature of the case by which the coefficients 
or numbers which are to be employed along with the 
number representing the time in calculating this second 
term can be determined to be of one magnitude rather 
than of any other therefore he infers there can be no 
such coefficients and that the velocity is in each case equal 
to some constant number independent of the time and 
is therefore the same for all times 

in reply to this we may observe that the circum 
stance of our not seeing in the nature of the case any 
thing which determines for us the coefficients above 
spoken off cannot prove that they have not some certain 
value in nature we do not see in the nature of the 
case anything which should determine a body to fall six 
teen feet in a second of time rather than one foot or one 
hundred feet yet in fact the space thus run through by 
falling bodies is determined to a certain magnitude it 
would be easy to assign a mathematical expression for 
the velocity of a body implying that onehundredth of 
the velocity or any other fraction is lost in each second 
and where is the absurdity of supposing such an expres 
sion really to represent the velocity 

most modern writers on mechanics have embraced 
the opposite opinion and have ascribed our knowledge of 

 this would be the case if t being the number of seconds 
elapsed and c some constant quantity the velocity were expressed by 
this mathematical formula 

c f

 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

this first law of motion to experience thus m poisson 
one of the most eminent of the mathematicians who have 
written on this subject says we cannot affirm a 
priori that the velocity communicated to a body will not 
become slower and slower of itself and end by being 
entirely extinguished it is only by experience and 
induction that this question can be decided 

yet it cannot be denied that there is much force in 
those arguments by which it is attempted to shew that 
the first law of motion such as we find it is more con 
sonant to our conceptions than any other would be the 
law as it exists is the most simple that we can conceive 
instead of having to determine by experiments what is 
the law of the natural change of velocity we find the law 
to be that it does not change at all to a certain 
extent the law depends upon the evident axiom that no 
change can take place without a cause but the ques 
tion further occurs whether the mere lapse of time may 
not be a cause of change of velocity in order to ensure 
this we have recourse to experiment and the result is 
that time alone does not produce any such change in 
addition to the conditions of change which we collect 
from our own ideas we ask of experience what other 
conditions and circumstances she has to offer and the 
answer is that she can point out none when we have 
removed the alterations which external causes in our 
very conception of them occasion there are no longer 
any alterations instead of having to guide ourselves by 
experience we learn that on this subject she has nothing 
to tell us instead of having to take into account a num 
ber of circumstances we find that we have only to 
reject all circumstances the velocity of a body remains 
unaltered by time alone of whatever kind the body 
itself be 

but the doctrine that time alone is not a cause of 

 poisson dynamique ed art 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

change of velocity in any body is further recommended 
to us by this consideration that time is conceived by 
us not as a cause but only as a condition of other causes 
producing their effects causes operate in time but it 
is only when the cause exists that the lapse of time can 
give rise to alterations when therefore all external 
causes of change of velocity are supposed to be removed 
the velocity must continue identical with itself whatever 
the time which elapses an eternity of negation can 
produce no positive result 

thus though the discovery of the first law of 
motion was made historically speaking by means of 
experiment we have now attained a point of view in 
which we see that it might have been certainly known 
to be true independently of experience this law in its 
ultimate form when completely simplified and steadily 
contemplated assumes the character of a selfevident 
truth we shall find the same process to take place in 
other instances and this feature in the progress of 
science will hereafter be found to suggest very important 
views with regard both to the nature and prospects of our 
knowledge 

 gravity is a uniform force we shall find 
observations of the same kind offering themselves in a 
manner more or less obvious with regard to the other 
principles of dynamics the determination of the laws 
according to which bodies fall downwards by the common 
action of gravity has already been noticed in the history 
of mechanics as one of the earliest positive advances 
in the doctrine of motion these laws were first rightly 
stated by galileo and established by reasoning and by 
experiment not without dissent and controversy the 
amount of these doctrines is this that gravity is a 
uniform accelerating force such a uniform force having 
this for its character that it makes the velocity increase in 

 hist tnd sciy ii 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

exact proportion to the time of motion the relation which 
the spaces described by the body bear to the times in 
which they are described is obtained by mathematical 
deduction from this definition of the force 

the clear definition of a uniform accelerating force 
and the proposition that gravity is such a force were 
coordinate and contemporary steps in this discovery 
in defining accelerating force reference tacit or ex 
press was necessarily made to the second of the general 
axioms respecting causation that causes are measured 
by their effects force in the cases now under our 
notice is conceived to be as we have already stated 
p any cause which acting from without changes 
the motion of a body it must therefore in this accep 
tation be measured by the magnitude of the changes 
which are produced but in what manner the changes 
of motion are to be employed as the measures of force is 
learnt from observation of the facts which we see taking 
place in the world experience interprets the axiom of 
causation from which otherwise we could not deduce 
any real knowledge we may assume in virtue of our 
general conceptions of force that under the same circum 
stances a greater change of motion implies a greater force 
producing it but what are we to expect when the cir 
cumstances change the weight of a body makes it 
fall from rest at first and causes it to move more quickly 
as it descends lower we may express this by saying 
that gravity the universal force which makes all terres 
trial bodies fall when not supported by its continuous 
action first gives velocity to the body when it has none 
and afterwards adds velocity to that which the body 
already has but how is the velocity added proportioned 
to the velocity which already exists force acting on a 
body at rest and on a body in motion appears under 
very different conditions how are the effects related 
let the force be conceived to be in both cases the 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

same since force is conceived to depend upon the extra 
neous bodies and not upon the condition of the moving 
mass itself but the force being the same the effects 
may still be different it is at first sight conceivable 
that the body acted upon by the same gravity may 
receive a less addition of velocity when it is already 
moving in the direction in which this gravity impels it 
for if we ourselves push a body forwards we can produce 
little additional effect upon it when it is already moving 
rapidly away from us may it not be true in like man 
ner that although gravity be always the same force its 
effect depends upon the velocity which the body under 
its influence already possesses 

observation and reasoning combined as we have 
said enabled galileo to answer these questions he 
asserted and proved that we may consistently and properly 
measure a force by the velocity which is by it generated 
in a body in some certain time as one second and 
further that if we adopt this measure gravity will be a 
force of the same value under all circumstances of the 
body which it affects since it appeared that in fact a 
falling body does receive equal increments of velocity 
in equal times from first to last 

if it be asked whether we could have known anterior 
to or independent of experiment that gravity is a 
uniform force in the sense thus imposed upon the term 
it appears clear that we must reply that we could not 
have attained to such knowledge since other laws of the 
motion of bodies downwards are easily conceivable and 
nothing but observation could inform us that one of 
these laws does not prevail in fact indeed we may add 
that the assertion that the force of gravity is uniform is 
so far from being selfevident that it is not even true 
for gravity varies according to the distance from the 
centre of the earth and although this variation is so 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

small as to be in the case of falling bodies imperceptible 
it negatives the rigorous uniformity of the force as com 
pletely though not to the same extent as if the weight 
of a body diminished in a marked degree when it was 
carried from the lower to the upper room of a house it 
cannot then be a truth independent of experience that 
gravity is uniform 

yet in fact the assertion that gravity is uniform was 
assented to not only before it was proved but even 
before it was clearly understood it was readily granted 
by all that bodies which fall freely are uniformly accele 
rated but while some held the opinion just stated that 
uniformly accelerated motion is that in which the velocity 
increases in proportion to the time others maintained 
that that is uniformly accelerated motion in which the 
velocity increases in proportion to the space so that for 
example a body in falling vertically through twenty feet 
should acquire twice as great a velocity as one which 
falls through ten feet 

these two opinions are both put forward by the 
interlocutors of galileos dialogue on this subject 
and the latter supposition is rejected the author showing 
not that it is inconsistent with experience but that it is 
impossible in itself inasmuch as it would inevitably lead 
to the conclusion that the fall though a large and a 
small vertical space would occupy exactly the same time 
indeed galileo assumes his definition of uniformly 
accelerated motion as one which is sufficiently recom 
mended by its own simplicity if we attend carefully 
he says we shall find that no mode of increase of velocity 
is more simple than that which adds equal increments in 
equal times which we may easily understand if we 
consider the close affinity of time and motion for as the 
uniformity of motion is defined by the equality of spaces 
 dlalogo iii p t ibid p 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

described in equal times so we may conceive the uni 
formity of acceleration to exist when equal velocities are 
added in equal times 

galileos mode of supporting his opinion that bodies 
falling by the action of gravity are thus uniformly acce 
lerated consists in the first place in adducing the 
maxim that nature always employs the most simple 
means but he is far from considering this a decisive 
argument i says one of his speakers as it would 
be very unreasonable in me to gainsay this or any other 
definition which any author may please to make since 
they are all arbitrary may still without offence doubt 
whether such a definition conceived and admitted in the 
abstract fits agrees and is verified in that kind of 
accelerated motion which bodies have when they descend 
naturally 

the experimental proof that bodies when they fall 
downwards are uniformly accelerated is by galileo 
derived from the inclined plane and therefore assumes 
the proposition that if such uniform acceleration prevail 
in vertical motion it will also hold when a body is com 
pelled to describe an oblique rectilinear path this pro 
position may be shown to be true if assuming by anti 
cipation the third law of motion of which we shall 
shortly have to speak we introduce the conception of 
a uniform statical force as the cause of uniform acce 
leration for the force on the inclined plane bears 
a constant proportion to the vertical force and this 
proportion is known from statical considerations but 
in the work of which we are speaking galileo does 
not introduce this abstract conception of force as the 
foundation of his doctrines instead of this he pro 
poses as a postulate sufficiently evident to be made 
the basis of his reasonings that bodies which descend 

 dialogo iii p 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

clown inclined planes of different inclinations but of 
the same vertical height all acquire the same velocity 
but when this postulate has been propounded by one 
of the persons of the dialogue another interlocutor says 
 you discourse very probably but besides this like 
lihood i wish to augment the probability so far that 
it shall be almost as complete as a necessary demon 
stration he then proceeds to describe a very inge 
nious and simple experiment which shows that when a 
body is made to swing upwards at the end of a string 
it attains to the same height whatever is the path it 
follows so long as it starts from the lowest point with 
the same velocity and thus galileos postulate is ex 
perimentally confirmed so far as the force of gravity can 
be taken as an example of the forces which the postulate 
contemplates and conversely gravity is proved to be a 
uniform force so far as it can be considered clear that 
the postulate is true of uniform forces 

when we have introduced the conception and defi 
nition of accelerating force galileos postulate that 
bodies descending down inclined planes of the same 
vertical height acquire the same velocity may by a 
few steps of reasoning be demonstrated to be true of 
uniform forces and thus the proof that gravity either in 
vertical or oblique motion is a uniform force is confirmed 
by the experiment above mentioned as it also is on 
like grounds by many other experiments made upon 
inclined planes and pendulums 

thus the propriety of galileos conception of a uni 
form force and the doctrine that gravity is a uniform 
force were confirmed by the same reasonings and experi 
ments we may make here two remarks first that the 
conception when established and rightly stated appears 
so simple as hardly to require experimental proof a 
remark which we have already made with regard to the 

 iii p 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

first law of motion and second that the discovery of 
the real law of nature was made by assuming propositions 
which without further proof we should consider as very 
precarious and as far less obvious as well as less evident 
than the law of nature in its simple form 

 the second law of motion when a body instead 
of falling downwards from rest is thrown in any direc 
tion it describes a curve line till its motion is stopped 
in this and in all other cases in which a body describes 
a curved path in free space its motion is determined by 
the second law of motion the law in its general 
form is as follows when a body is thus cast forth 
and acted upon by a force in a direction transverse to its 
motion the result is that there is combined with the 
motion with which the body is throivn another motion 
exactly the same as that which the same force would have 
communicated to a body at rest 

it will readily be understood that the basis of this 
law is the axiom already stated that effects are measured 
by their causes in virtue of this axiom the effect of 
gravity acting upon a body in a direction transverse to its 
motion must measure the accelerative or deflective force 
of gravity under those circumstances if this effect vary 
with the varying velocity and direction of the body thus 
acted upon the deflective force of gravity also will vary 
with those circumstances the more simple supposition 
is that the deflective force of gravity is the same whatever 
be the velocity and direction of the body which is sub 
jected to its influence and this is the supposition which 
we find to be verified by facts for example a ball let 
fall from the top of a ships upright mast when she is 
sailing steadily forward will fall at the foot of the mast 
just as if it were let fall while the ship were at rest thus 
showing that the motion which gravity gives to the ball 
is compounded with the horizontal motion which the ball 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

shares with the ship from the first this general and 
simple conception of motions as compounded with one 
another represents it is proved the manner in which the 
motion produced by gravity modifies any other motion 
which the body may previously have had 

the discussions which terminated in the general 
reception of this second law of motion among mechani 
cal writers were much mixed up with the arguments for 
and against the copernican system which system repre 
sented the earth as revolving upon its axis for the 
obvious argument against this system was that if the 
earth were thus in motion from west to east a stone 
dropt from the top of a tower would be left behind the 
tower moving away from it and the answer was that by 
this law of motion the stone would have the earths 
motion impressed upon it as well as that motion which 
would arise from its gravity to the earth and that the 
motion of the stone relative to the tower would thus be 
the same as if both earth and tower were at rest gali 
leo further urged as a presumption in favour of the 
opinion that the two motions the circular motion arising 
from the rotation of the earth and the downward motion 
arising from the gravity of the stone would be com 
pounded in the way we have described neither of them 
disturbing or diminishing the other that the first 
motion was in its own nature not liable to any change or 
diminution as we learn from the first law of motion 
nor was the subject lightly dismissed the experiment 
of the stone let fall from the top of the mast was made 
in various forms by gassendi and in his epistle de 
motu impwsso a motore translate the rule now in question 
is supported by reference to these experiments in this 
manner the general truth the second law of motion 
was established completely and beyond dispute 

 dialogo ii p 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

but when this law had been proved to be true in a 
general sense with such accuracy as rude experiments 
like those of galileo and gassendi would admit it still 
remained to be ascertained supposing our knowledge of 
the law to be the result of experience alone whether it 
were true with that precise and rigorous exactness which 
more refined modes of experimenting could test we 
so willingly believe in the simplicity of laws of nature 
that the rigorous accuracy of such a law known to be at 
least approximately true was taken for granted till some 
ground for suspecting the contrary should appear yet 
calculations have not been wanting which might confirm 
the law as true to the last degree of accuracy laplace 
relates syst du monde livre iv chap that at one 
time he had conceived it possible that the effect of gravity 
upon the moon might be slightly modified by the moons 
direction and velocity and that in this way an explana 
tion might be found for the moons acceleration a devia 
tion of her observed from her calculated place which long 
perplexed mathematicians but it was after some time 
discovered that this feature in the moons motion arose 
from another cause and the second law of motion was 
confirmed as true in the most rigorous sense 

thus we see that although there were arguments 
which might be urged in favour of this law founded 
upon the necessary relations of ideas men became con 
vinced of its truth only when it was verified and con 
firmed by actual experiment but yet in this case 
again as in the former ones when the law had been 
established beyond doubt or question men were very 
ready to believe that it was not a mere result of observa 
tion that the truth which it contained was not derived 
from experience that it might have been assumed as 
true in virtue of reasonings anterior to experience and 
that experiments served only to make the law more plain 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

and intelligible as visible diagrams in geometry serve to 
illustrate geometrical truths our knowledge not being 
they deemed in mechanics any more than in geometry 
borrowed from the senses it was thought by many to be 
selfevident that the effect of a force in any direction 
cannot be increased or diminished by any motion trans 
verse to the direction of the force which the body may 
have at the same time or to express it otherwise that 
if the motion of the body be compounded of a horizontal 
and vertical motion the vertical motion alone will be 
affected by the vertical force this principle indeed not 
only has appeared evident to many persons but even at the 
present day is assumed as an axiom by many of the most 
eminent mathematicians it is for example so employed 
in the mecanique celeste of laplace which may be looked 
upon as the standard of mathematical mechanics in our 
time and in the mecanique analytique of lagrange the 
most consummate example which has appeared of sub 
tilty of thought on such subjects as well as of power of 
mathematical generalization and thus we have here 

 i may observe that the rule that we may compound motions as 
the law supposes is involved in the step of resolving them which is 
done in the passage to which i refer mec analyt ptie i sect i art

by resolving the forces which act upon a point in three rectangular

his mode of treating the subject is involved a principle which belongs 
to the third law of motion namely the doctrine that the velocity is 
as the force of which we shall have to speak elsewhere 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

another example of that circumstance which we have 
already noticed in speaking of the first law of motion 
p and of the law that gravity is a uniform force 
p namely that the law though historically esta 
blished by experiments appears when once discovered 
and reduced to its most simple and general form to be 
selfevident i am the more desirous of drawing atten 
tion to this feature in various portions of the history of 
science inasmuch as it will be found to lead to some very 
extensive and important views hereafter to be con 
sidered 

 the third law of motion we have in the 
definition of accelerating force a measure of forces so 
far as they are concerned in producing motion we had 
before in speaking of the principles of statics defined 
the measure of forces or pressures so far as they are 
employed in producing equilibrium but these two 
aspects of force are closely connected and we require a 
law which shall lay down the rule of their connexion 
by the same kind of muscular exertion by which we can 
support a heavy stone we can also put it in motion the 
question then occurs how is the rate and manner of its 
motion determined the answer to this question is con 
tained in the third law of motion and it is to this effect 
that the momentum which any pressure produces in the 
mass in a given time is proportional to the pressure by 
momentum is meant the product of the numbers which 
express the velocity and the mass of the body and hence 
if the mass of the body be the same in the instances 
which we compare the rule is that the velocity is as the 
force which produces it and this is one of the simplest 
ways of expressing the third law of motion 

in agreement with our general plan we have to ask 
what is the ground of this rule what is the simplest 
and most satisfactory form to which we can reduce the 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

proof of it or to take an instance if a double pres 
sure be exerted against a given mass so disposed as to 
be capable of motion why must it produce twice the 
velocity in the same time 

to answer this question suppose the double pressure 
to be resolved into two single pressures one of these 
will produce a certain velocity and the question is why 
an equal pressure acting upon the same mass will pro 
duce an equal velocity addition to the former or 
stating the matter otherwise the question is why each 
of the two forces will produce its separate effect unal 
tered by the simultaneous action of the other force 

this statement of the case makes it seem to approach 
very near to such cases as are included in the second law 
of motion and therefore it might appear that this third 
law has no grounds distinct from the second but it must 
be recollected that the workforce has a different meaning 
in this case and in that in this place it signifies pressure 
in the statement of the second law its import was acce 
lerative or deflective force measured by the velocity or 
deflexion generated and thus the third law of motion 
so far as our reasonings yet go appears to rest on a 
foundation different from the second 

accordingly that part of the third law of motion 
which we are now considering that the velocity generated 
is as the force was obtained in fact by a separate train 
of research the first exemplification of this law which 
was studied by mathematicians was the motion of bodies 
upon inclined planes for the force which urges a body 
clown an inclined plane is known by statics and hence 
the velocity of its descent was to be determined galileo 
originally in his attempts to solve this problem of the 
descent of a body down an inclined plane did not proceed 

 dial della sc nuov hi p see hist ind sci y ii 
p 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

from the principle which we have stated the determina 
tion of the force which acts down the inclined plane from 
statical considerations obvious as it may seem but 
assumed as we have already seen a proposition appa 
rently far more precarious namely that a body sliding 
down a smooth inclined plane acquires always the same 
velocity so long as the vertical height fallen through is 
the same and this conjecture for at first it was nothing 
more than a conjecture he confirmed by an ingenious 
experiment in which bodies acquired or lost the same 
velocity by descending or ascending through the same 
height although their paths were different in other 
respects 

this was the form in which the doctrine of the motion 
of bodies down inclined planes was at first presented in 
galileos dialogues on the science of motion but his 
disciple viviani was dissatisfied with the assumption thus 
introduced and in succeeding editions of the dialogues 
the apparent chasm in the reasoning was much narrowed 
by making the proof depend upon a principle nearly 
identical with the third law of motion as we have just 
stated it in the proof thus added we are agreed 
says the interlocutor that in a moving body the 
impetus energy momentum or propension to motion is 
as great as is the force or least resistance which suffices 
to sustain it and the impetus or momentum in the 
course of the proof being taken to be as the velocity 
produced in a given time it is manifest that the principle 
so stated amounts to this that the velocity produced 
is as the statical force and thus this law of motion 
appears in the school of galileo to have been suggested 
and established at first by experiment but afterwards 
confirmed and demonstrated by a priori considerations 

we see in the above reasoning a number of abstract

terms introduced which are not at first at least very 
distinctly defined as impetus momentum c of 
these momentum has been selected to express that 
quantity which in a moving body measures the statical 
force impressed upon the body this quantity is as we 
have just seen proportional to the velocity in a given 
body it is also in different bodies proportional to the 
mass of the body this part of the third law of motion 
follows from our conception of matter in general as con 
sisting of parts capable of addition a double pressure 
must be required to produce the same velocity in a double 
mass for if the mass be halved each half will require 
an equal pressure and the addition both of the pres 
sures and of the masses will take place without disturb 
ing the effects 

the measure of the quantity of matter of a body con 
sidered as affecting the velocity which pressure produces 
in the body is termed its inertia as we have already 
stated p inertia is the property by which a 
large mass of matter requires a greater force than a 
small mass to give it an equal velocity it belongs to 
each portion of matter and portions of inertia are 
added whenever portions of matter are added hence 
inertia is as the quantity of matter which is only ano 
ther way of expressing this third law of motion so far 
as quantity of matter is concerned 

but how do we know the quantity of matter of a 
body we may reply that we take the weight as the 
measure of the quantity of matter but we may then be 
again asked how it appears that the weight is propor 
tional to the inertia which it must be in order that the 
quantity of matter may be proportional to both one and 
the other we answer that this appears to be true 
experimentally because all bodies fall with equal veloci 
ties by gravity when the known causes of difference are 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

removed the observations of falling bodies indeed are 
not susceptible of much exactness but experiments lead 
ing to the same result and capable of great precision 
were made upon pendulums by newton as he relates in 
the principia book iii prop they all agreed he 
says with perfect accuracy and thus the weight and the 
inertia are proportional in all cases and therefore each 
proportional to the quantity of matter as measured by 
the other 

the conception of inertia as we have already seen in 
chapter v involves the notion of action and reaction 
and thus the laws which involve inertia depend upon the 
idea of mutual causation the rule that the velocity is 
as the force depends upon the principle of causation 
that the effect is proportional to the cause the effect 
being here so estimated as to be consistent both with the 
other laws of motion and with experiment 

but here as in other cases the question occurs again 
is experiment really requisite for the proof of this law 
if we look to authorities we shall be not a little embar 
rassed to decide dalembert is against the necessity of 
experimental proof why says he should we have 
recourse to this principle employed at the present day 
by everybody that the force is proportional to the velo 
city a principle resting solely upon this vague and 
obscure axiom that the effect is proportional to the cause 
we shall not examine here he adds if this principle 
is necessarily true we shall only avow that the proofs 
which have hitherto been adduced do not appear to us 
unexceptionable nor shall we with some geometers 
adopt it as a purely contingent truth which would be 
to ruin the certainty of mechanics and to reduce it to be 
nothing more than an experimental science we shall 
content ourselves with observing he proceeds that 

 dynamique pref p x

certain or doubtful clear or obscure it is useless in mecha 
nics and consequently ought to be banished from the 
science though dalembert rejects the third law of 
motion in this form he accepts one of equivalent import 
which appears to him to possess axiomatic certainty and 
this procedure is in consistence with the course which he 
takes of claiming for the science of mechanics more than 
mere experimental truth on the contrary laplace con 
siders this third law as established by experiment is 
the force he says proportional to the velocity 
this he replies we cannot know a priori seeing that 
we are in ignorance of the nature of moving force we 
must therefore for this purpose recur to experience for 
all which is not a necessary consequence of the few data 
we have respecting the nature of things is for us only 
a result of observation and again he saysf here 
then we have two laws of motion the law of inertia the 
first law of motion and the law of the force proportional 
to the velocity which are given by observation they 
are the most natural and the most simple laws which we 
can imagine and without doubt they flow from the very 
nature of matter but this nature being unknown they 
are for us only observed facts the only ones however 
which mechanics borrows from experience 

it will appear i think from the views given in this 
and several other parts of the present work that we can 
not with justice say that we have very few data respect 
ing the nature of things in speculating concerning the 
laws of the universe since all the consequences which 
flow from the relations of our fundamental ideas neces 
sarily regulate our knowledge of things so far as we have 
any such knowledge nor can we say that the nature of 
matter is unknown to us in any sense in which we can 
conceive knowledge as possible the nature of matter is 

 mec cel p t p 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

no more unknown than the nature of space or of number 
in our conception of matter as of space and of number 
are involved certain relations which are the necessary 
groundwork of our knowledge and anything which is 
independent of these relations is not unknown but 
inconceivable 

it must be already clear to the reader from the 
phraseology employed by these two eminent mathema 
ticians that the question respecting the formation of the 
third law of motion can only be solved by a careful con 
sideration of what we mean by observation and experi 
ence nature and matter but it will probably be gene 
rally allowed that taking into account the explanations 
already offered of the necessary conditions of experience 
and of the conception of inertia this law of motion that 
the inertia is as the quantity of matter is almost or alto 
gether selfevident 

 action and reaction are equal in moving bodies 
when we have to consider bodies as acting upon one 
another and influencing each others motions the third 
law of motion is still applied but along with this we 
also employ the general principle that action and reaction 
are equal and opposite action and reaction are here to 
be understood as momentum produced and destroyed 
according to the measure of action established by the 
third law of motion and the cases in which this prin 
ciple is thus employed form so large a portion of those in 
which the third law of motion is used that some writers 
newton at the head of them have stated the equality of 
action and reaction as the third law of motion 

the third law of motion being once established the 
equality of action and reaction in the sense of momentum 
gained and lost necessarily follows thus if a weight 
hanging by a string over the edge of a smooth level table 
draw another weight along the table the hanging weight 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

moves more slowly than it would do if not so connected 
and thus loses velocity by the connexion while the other 
weight gains by the connexion all the velocity which it 
has for if left to itself it would rest and the pressures 
which restrain the descent of the first body and accelerate 
that of the second are equal at all instants of time for 
each of these pressures is the tension of the string and 
hence by the third law of motion the momentum gained 
by the one body and the momentum lost by the other in 
virtue of the action of this string are equal and similar 
reasoning may be employed in any other case where bodies 
are connected 

the case where one body does not push or draw but 
strikes another appeared at first to mechanical reasoners 
to be of a different nature from the others but a little 
consideration was sufficient to show that a blow is in 
fact only a short and violent pressure and that there 
fore the general rule of the equality of momentum lost 
and gained applies to this as well as to the other cases 

thus in order to determine the case of the direct 
action of bodies upon one another we require no new law 
of motion the equality of action and reaction which 
enters necessarily into every conception of mechanical 
operation combined with the measure of action as given 
by the third law of motion enables us to trace the con 
sequences of every case whether of pressure or of 
impact 

 dalemberfs principle but what will be the 
result when bodies do not act directly upon each other 
but are indirectly connected in any way by levers strings 
pulleys or in any other manner so that one part of the 
system has a mechanical advantage over another the 
result must still be determined by the principle that 
action and reaction balance each other the action and 
reaction being pressures in one sense must balance each 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

other by the laws of statics for these laws determine 
the equilibrium of pressure now action and reaction 
according to their measures in the third law of motion 
are momentum gained and lost when the action is direct 
and except the indirect action introduce some modifica 
tion of the law they must have the same measure still 
but in fact we cannot well conceive any modification of 
the law to take place in this case for direct action is only 
one the ultimate case of indirect action thus if two heavy 
bodies act at different points of a lever the action of each 
on the other is indirect but if the two points come toge 
ther the action becomes direct hence the rule must be 
that which we have already stated for if the rule were 
false for indirect action it would also be false for direct 
action for which case we have shown it to be true and 
thus we obtain the general principle that in any system 
of bodies which act on each other action and reaction 
estimated by momentum gained and lost balance each 
other according to the laws of equilibrium this prin 
ciple which is so general as to supply a key to the solu 
tion of all possible mechanical problems is commonly 
called dakmberts principle the experimental proofs 
which convinced men of the truth of the third law of 
motion were many or most of them proofs of the law in 
this extended sense and thus the proof of dalemberts 
principle both from the idea of mechanical action and 
from experience is included in the proof of the law 
already stated 

 connexion of dynamical and statical principles 
the principle of equilibrium of dalembert just stated 
is the law which he would substitute for the third law of 
motion and he would thus remove the necessity for an 
independent proof of that law in like mariner the 
second law of motion is by some writers derived from the 
principle of the composition of statical forces and they 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

would thus supersede the necessity of a reference to 
experiment in that case laplace takes this course and 
thus as we have seen rests only the first and third law 
of motion upon experience newton on the other hand 
recognises the same connexion of propositions but for a 
different purpose for he derives the composition of 
statical forces from the second law of motion 

the close connexion of these three principles the 
composition of statical forces the composition of acce 
lerating forces with velocities and the measure of 
moving forces by velocities cannot be denied yet it 
appears to be by no means easy to supersede the neces 
sity of independent proofs of the two last of these prin 
ciples both may be proved or illustrated by expe 
riment and the experiments which prove the one are 
different from those which establish the other for 
example it appears by easy calculations that when we 
apply our principles to the oscillations of a pendulum 
the second law is proved by the fact that the oscillations 
take place at the same rate in an east and west and in a 
north and south direction under the same circumstances 
the third law is proved by our finding that the time of a 
small oscillation is proportional to the square root of the 
length of a pendulum and similar differences might be 
pointed out in other experiments as to their bearing 
upon the one law or the other 

 mechanical principles become gradually more 
simple and more evident i will again point out in 
general two circumstances which i have already noticed 
in particular cases of the laws of motion truths are 
often at first assumed in a form which is far from being 
the most obvious or simple and truths once discovered 
are gradually simplified so as to assume the appearance 
of selfevident truths 

the former circumstance is exemplified in several of 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

the instances which ve have had to consider the 
assumption that a perpetual motion is impossible pre 
ceded the knowledge of the first law of motion the 
assumed equality of the velocities acquired down two 
inclined planes of the same height was afterwards reduced 
to the third law of motion by galileo himself in the 
history we have noted huyghenss assumption of the 
equality of the actual descent and potential ascent of the 
centre of gravity this was afterwards reduced by her 
man and the bernoulli s to the statical equivalence of the 
solicitations of gravity and the vicarious solicitations of 
the effective forces which act on each point and finally 
to the principle of dalembert which asserts that the 
motions gained and lost balance each other 

this assertion of principles which now appear neither 
obvious nor selfevident is not to be considered as a 
groundless assertion on the part of the discoverers by 
whom it was made on the contrary it is evidence of 
the deep sagacity and clear thought which were requisite 
in order to make such discoveries for these results are 
really rigorous consequences of the laws of motion in 
their simplest form and the evidence of them was pro 
bably present though undeveloped in the minds of the 
discoverers we are told of geometrical students who 
by a peculiar aptitude of mind perceived the evidence of 
some of the more advanced propositions of geometry 
without going through the introductory steps we must 
suppose a similar aptitude for mechanical reasonings 
which led stevinus galileo newton and huyghens to 
make those assumptions which finally resolved themselves 
into the laws of motion 

we may observe further that the simplicity and evi 
dence which the laws of mechanics have at length 
assumed are much favoured by the usage of words among 

 vol ii p 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

the best writers on such subjects terms which origi 
nally and before the laws of motion were fully known 
were used in a very vague and fluctuating sense were 
afterwards limited and rendered precise so that assertions 
which at first appear identical propositions become dis 
tinct and important principles thus force motion 
momentum are terms which were employed though in a 
loose manner from the very outset of mechanical specu 
lation and so long as these words retained the vagueness 
of common language it would have been a useless and 
barren truism to say that the momentum is proportional 
to the force or that a body loses as much motion as 
it communicates to another but when momentum 
and quantity of motion are defined to mean the pro 
duct of mass and velocity these two propositions imme 
diately become distinct statements of the third law of 
motion and its consequences in like manner the asser 
tion that gravity is a uniform force was assented to 
before it was settled what a uniform force was but this 
assertion only became significant and useful when that 
point had been properly determined the statement 
that when different motions are communicated to the 
same body their effects are compounded becomes the 
second law of motion when we define what composition 
of motions is and the same process may be observed 
in other cases 

and thus we see how well the form which science 
ultimately assumes is adapted to simplify it the defi 
nitions which are adopted and the terms which become 
current in precise senses produce a complete harmony 
between the matter and the form of our knowledge so 
that truths which were at first unexpected and recondite 
became familiar phrases and after a few generations 
sound even to common ears like identical propositions 

 controversy of the measure of force in the his 



establishment of the principles of dynamics 

tory of mechanics we have given an account of the 
controversy which for some time occupied the mathema 
ticians of europe whether the forces of bodies in motion 
should be reckoned proportional to the velocity or to the 
square of the velocity we need not here recall the 
events of this dispute but we may remark that its his 
tory as a metaphysical controversy is remarkable in this 
respect that it has been finally and completely settled 
for it is now agreed among mathematicians that both 
sides were right and that the results of mechanical 
action may be expressed with equal correctness by means of 
momentum and of vis viva it is in one sense as dalem 
bert has saidf a dispute about words but we are not 
to infer that on that account it was frivolous or useless 
for such disputes are one principal means of reducing the 
principles of our knowledge to their utmost simplicity 
and clearness the terms which are employed in the 
science of mechanics are now liberated for ever in the 
minds of mathematicians from that ambiguity which was 
the battleground in the war of the vis viva 

but we may observe that the real reason of this con 
troversy was exactly that tendency which we have been 
noticing the disposition of man to assume in his specu 
lations certain general propositions as true and to fix the 
sense of terms so that they shall fall in with this truth 
it was agreed on all hands that in the mutual action of 

 vol ii p 

f dalembert has also remarked dynamique pref xxi that 
this controversy shows how little justice and precision there is in the 
pretended axiom that causes are proportional to their effects but 
this reflection is by no means well founded for since both measures 
are true it appears that causes may qjiastly measured by their effects 
even when very different kinds of effects are taken that the axiom 
does not point out one precise measure till illustrated by experience or 
by other considerations we grant but the same thing occurs in the 
application of other axioms also 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

bodies the same quantity of force is always preserved 
and the question was by which of the two measures this 
rule could best be verified we see therefore that the 
dispute was not concerning a definition merely but con 
cerning a definition combined with a general proposition 
such a question may be readily conceived to have been 
by no means unimportant and we may remark in pass 
ing that such controversies although they are commonly 
afterwards stigmatised as quarrels about words and defi 
nitions are in reality events of considerable conse 
quence in the history of science since they dissipate all 
ambiguity and vagueness in the use of terms and bring 
into view the conditions under which the fundamental 
principles of our knowledge can be most clearly and 
simply presented 

it is worth our while to pause for a moment on the 
prospect that we have thus obtained of the advance of 
knowledge as exemplified in the history of mechanics 
the general transformation of our views from vague to 
definite from complex to simple from unexpected dis 
coveries to selfevident truths from seeming contradic 
tions to identical propositions is very remarkable but it 
is by no means peculiar to our subject the same cir 
cumstances more or less prominently more or less deve 
loped appear in the history of other sciences according 
to the point of advance which each has reached they 
bear upon very important doctrines respecting the pro 
spects the limits and the very nature of our knowledge 
and though these doctrines require to be considered with 
reference to the whole body of science yet the peculiar 
manner in which they are illustrated by the survey of the 
history of mechanics on which we have just been engaged 
appears to make this a convenient place for introducing 
them to the reader 



 



chapter viii 

of the paradox of universal proposi 
tions obtained from experience 

 it was formerly stated that experience cannot 
establish any universal or necessary truths the number 
of trials of any proposition is necessarily limited and 
observation alone cannot give us any ground of extend 
ing the inference to untried cases observed facts have 
no visible bond of necessary connexion and no exercise 
of our senses can enable us to discover such connexion 
we can never acquire from a mere observation of facts 
the right to assert that a proposition is true in all cases 
and that it could not be otherwise than we find it to be 

yet as we have just seen in the history of the laws of 
motion we may go on collecting our knowledge from 
observation and enlarging and simplifying it till it ap 
proaches or attains to complete universality and seeming 
necessity whether the laws of motion as we now know 
them can be rigorously traced to an absolute necessity in 
the nature of things we have not ventured absolutely to 
pronounce but we have seen that some of the most 
acute and profound mathematicians have believed that 
for these laws of motion or some of them there was 
such a demonstrable necessity compelling them to be 
such as they are and no other most of those who have 
carefully studied the principles of mechanics will allow 
that some at least of the primary laws of motion approach 
very near to this character of necessary truth and will 
confess that it would be difficult to imagine any other 
consistent scheme of fundamental principles and almost 
all mathematicians will allow to these laws an absolute 
universality so that we may apply them without scruple 

 b i c of experience 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

or misgiving in cases the most remote from those to 
which our experience has extended what astronomer 
would fear to refer to the known laws of motion in rea 
soning concerning the double stars although these objects 
are at an immeasurably remote distance from that solar 
system which has been the only field of our observation 
of mechanical facts what philosopher in speculating 
respecting a magnetic fluid or a luminiferous ether would 
hesitate to apply to it the mechanical principles which 
are applicable to fluids of known mechanical properties 
when we assert that the quantity of motion in the world 
cannot be increased or diminished by the mutual actions of 
bodies does not every mathematician feel convinced that 
it would be an un philosophical restriction to limit this 
proposition to such modes of action as we have tried 

yet no one can doubt that in historical fact these 
laws were collected from experience that such is the 
case is no matter of conjecture we know the time the 
persons the circumstances belonging to each step of each 
discovery i have in the history given an account of 
these discoveries and in the previous chapters of the 
present work i have further examined the nature and 
the import of the principles which were thus brought to 
light 

here then is an apparent contradiction experi 
ence it would seem has done that which we had proved 
that she cannot do she has led men to propositions 
universal at least and to principles which appear to some 
persons necessary what is the explanation of this con 
tradiction the solution of this paradox is it true that 
experience can reveal to us universal and necessary truths 
does she possess some secret virtue some unsuspected 
power by which she can detect connexions and conse 
quences which we have declared to be out of her sphere 
can she see more than mere appearances and observe 



paradox of universal propositions 

more than mere facts can she penetrate in some way 
to the nature of things descend below the surface of 
phenomena to their causes and origins so as to be able to 
say what can and what can not be what occurrences are 
partial and what universal if this be so we have in 
deed mistaken her character and powers and the whole 
course of our reasoning becomes precarious and obscure 
but then when we return upon our path we cannot find 
the point at which we deviated we cannot detect the 
false step in our deduction it still seems that by expe 
rience strictly so called we cannot discover necessary 
and universal truths our senses can give us no evidence 
of a necessary connexion in phenomena our observa 
tion must be limited and cannot testify concerning any 
thing which is beyond its limits a general view of our 
faculties appears to prove it to be impossible that men 
should do what the history of the science of mechanics 
shows that they have done 

 but in order to try to solve this paradox let us 
again refer to the history of mechanics in the cases 
belonging to that science in which propositions of the 
most unquestionable universality and most approaching 
to the character of necessary truths as for instance the 
laws of motion have been arrived at what is the source 
of the axiomatic character which the propositions thus 
assume the answer to this question will we may hope 
throw some light on the perplexity in which we appear to 
be involved 

now the answer to this inquiry is that the laws of 
motion borrow their axiomatic character from their 
being merely interpretations of the axioms of causation 
those axioms being exhibitions of the idea of cause 
under various aspects are of the most rigorous univer 
sality and necessity and so far as the laws of motion 
are exemplifications of those axioms these laws must be 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

no less universal and necessary how these axioms are 
to be understood in what sense cause and effect action 
and reaction are to be taken experience and observation 
did in fact teach inquirers on this subject and without 
this teaching the laws of motion could never have been 
distinctly known if two forces act together each must 
produce its effect by the axiom of causation and 
therefore the effects of the separate forces must be 
compounded but a long course of discussion and experi 
ment must instruct men of what kind this composition of 
forces is again action and reaction must be equal 
but much thought and some trial were needed to show 
what action and reaction are those metaphysicians who 
enunciated laws of motion without reference to expe 
rience propounded only such laws as were vague and 
inapplicable but yet these persons manifested the 
indestructible conviction belonging to mans speculative 
nature that there exist laws of motion that is universal 
formulae connecting the causes and effects when motion 
takes place those mechanicians again who observed 
facts involving equilibrium and motion and stated some 
narrow rules without attempting to ascend to any 
universal and simple principle obtained laws no less 
barren and useless than the metaphysicians for they 
could not tell in what new cases or whether in any their 
laws would be verified they needed a more general 
rule to show them the limits of the rule they had dis 
covered they went wrong in each attempt to solve a 
new problem because their interpretation of the terms of 
the axioms though true perhaps in certain cases was 
not right in general 

thus pappus erred in attempting to interpret as 
a case of the lever the problem of supporting a weight 
upon an inclined plane thus aristotle erred in inter 
preting the doctrine that the weight of bodies is the 



paradox of universal propositions 

cause of their fall thus kepler erred in interpreting the 
rule that the velocity of bodies depends upon the force 
thus bernoulli erred in interpreting the equality of 
action and reaction upon a lever in motion in each of 
these instances true doctrines already established whe 
ther by experiment or otherwise were erroneously applied 
and the error was corrected by further reflection which 
pointed out that another mode of interpretation was requi 
site in order that the axiom which was appealed to in 
each case might retain its force in the most general sense 
and in the reasonings which avoided or corrected such 
errors and which led to substantial general truths the 
object of the speculator always was to give to the acknow 
ledged maxims which the idea of cause suggested such 
a signification as should be consistent with their universal 
validity the rule was not accepted as particular at the 
outset and afterwards generalized more and more widely 
but from the very first the universality of the rule was 
assumed and the question was how it should be under 
stood so as to be universally true at every stage of 
speculation the law was regarded as a general law this 
was not an aspect which it gradually acquired by the 
accumulating contributions of experience but a feature 
of its original and native character what should 
happen universally experience might be needed to show 
but that what happened should happen universally was 
implied in the nature of knowledge the universality of 
the laws of motion was not gathered from experience 
ijowever much the laws themselves might be so 

 thus we obtain the solution of our paradox so 
far as the case before us is concerned the laws of 
motion borrow their form from the idea of causation 
though their matter may be given by experience and 
hence they possess a universality which experience cannot 

 hist ind sc ii p

give they are certainly and universally valid and the 
only question for observation to decide is how they are 
to be understood they are like general mathematical 
formulae which are known to be true even while we are 
ignorant what are the unknown quantities which they 
involve it must be allowed on the other hand that so 
long as these formulae are not interpreted by a real study 
of nature they are not only useless but prejudicial filling 
mens minds with vague general terms empty maxims 
and unintelligible abstractions which they mistake for 
knowledge of such perversion of the speculative pro 
pensities of mans nature the world has seen too much 
in all ages yet we must not on that account despise 
these forms of truth since without them no general 
knowledge is possible without general terms and 
maxims and abstractions we can have no science no 
speculation hardly indeed consistent thought or the 
exercise of reason the course of real knowledge is to 
obtain from thought and experience the right interpreta 
tion of our general terms the real import of our maxims 
the true generalizations which our abstractions involve 

 if it be asked how experience is able to teach us 
to interpret aright the general terms which the axioms 
of causation involve whence she derives the light 
which she is to throw on these general notions the 
answer is obvious namely that the relations of causa 
tion are the conditions of experience that the general 
notions are exemplified in the particular cases of which 
she takes cognizance the events which take place 
about us and which are the objects of our observation 
we cannot conceive otherwise than as subject to the 
laws of cause and effect every event must have a 
cause every effect must be determined by its cause 
these maxims are true of the phenomena which form the 
materials of our experience it is precisely to them 



paradox of universal propositions 

that these truths apply it is in the world which we 
have before our eyes that these propositions are univer 
sally verified and it is therefore by the observation of 
what we see that we must learn how these propositions 
are to be understood every fact every experiment is 
an example of these statements and it is therefore by 
attention to and familiarity with facts and experiments 
that we learn the signification of the expressions in which 
the statements are made just as in any other case we 
learn the import of language by observing the manner in 
which it is applied in known cases experience is the 
interpreter of nature it being understood that she is to 
make her interpretation in that comprehensive phraseo 
logy which is the genuine language of science 

 we may return for an instant to the objection 
that experience cannot give us general truths since after 
any number of trials confirming a rule we may for 
aught we can foresee have one which violates the rule 
when we have seen a thousand stones fall to the ground 
we may see one which does not fall under the same appa 
rent circumstances how then it is asked can experience 
teach us that all stones rigorously speaking will fall if 
unsupported and to this we reply that it is not true 
that we can conceive one stone to be suspended in the 
air while a thousand others fall without believing some 
peculiar cause to support it and that therefore such a 
supposition forms no exception to the law that gravity is 
a force by which all bodies are urged downwards un 
doubtedly we can conceive a body when dropt or thrown 
to move in a line quite different from other bodies thus 
a certain missile used by the natives of australia and 
lately brought to this country when thrown from the 
hand in a proper manner describes a curve and returns 
to the place from whence it was thrown but did any 

 called the bomerang

one therefore even for an instant suppose that the laws 
of motion are different for this and for other bodies on 
the contrary was not every person of a speculative turn 
immediately led to inquire how it was that the known 
causes which modify motion the resistance of the air and 
the other causes produced in this instance so peculiar an 
effect and if the motion had been still more unac 
countable it would not have occasioned any uncertainty 
whether it were consistent with the agency of gravity 
and the laws of motion if a body suddenly alter its 
direction or move in any other unexpected manner ve 
never doubt that there is a cause of the change we 
may continue quite ignorant of the nature of this cause 
but this ignorance never occasions a moments doubt that 
the cause exists and is exactly suited to the effect and 
thus experience can prove or discover to us general 
rules but she can never prove that general rules do not 
exist anomalies exceptions unexplained phenomena 
may remind us that we have much still to learn but they 
can never make us suppose that truths are not universal 
we may observe facts that show us we have not fully 
understood the meaning of our general laws but we can 
never find facts which show our laws to have no meaning 
our experience is bound in by the limits of cause and 
effect and can give us no information concerning any 
region where that relation does not prevail the whole 
series of external occurrences and objects through all 
time and space exists only and is conceived only as 
subject to this relation and therefore we endeavour 
in vain to imagine to ourselves when and where and 
how exceptions to this relation may occur the assump 
tion of the connexion of cause and effect is essential to 
our experience as the recognition of the maxims which 
express this connexion is essential to our knowledge 
 i have thus endeavoured to explain in some 



paradox of universal propositions 

measure how at least in the field of our mechanical know 
ledge experience can discover universal truths though 
she cannot give them their universality and how such 
truths though borrowing their form from our ideas cannot 
be understood except by the actual study of external 
nature and thus with regard to the laws of motion 
and other fundamental principles of mechanics the 
analysis of our ideas and the history of the progress of 
the science well illustrate each other 

if the paradox of the discovery of universal truths by 
experience be thus solved in one instance a much wider 
question offers itself to us how far the difficulty and 
how far the solution are applicable to other subjects it 
is easy to see that this question involves most grave and 
extensive doctrines with regard to the whole compass of 
human knowledge and the views to which we have been 
led in the present book of this work are we trust fitted 
to throw much light upon the general aspect of the sub 
ject but after discussions so abstract and perhaps 
obscure as those in which we have been engaged for 
some chapters i willingly postpone to a future occasion 
an investigation which may perhaps appear to most 
readers more recondite and difficult still and we have 
in fact many other special fields of knowledge to survey 
before we are led by the order of our subject to those 
general questions and doctrines those antitheses brought 
into view and again resolved which a view of the whole 
territory of human knowledge suggests and by which 
the nature and conditions of knowledge are exhibited 

before we quit the subject of mechanical science we 
shall make a few remarks on another doctrine t which 
forms part of the established truths of the science 
namely the doctrine of universal gravitation 



 



chapter ix 

of the establishment of the law of 
universal gravitation 

the doctrine of universal gravitation is a feature of 
so much importance in the history of science that we 
shall not pass it by without a few remarks on the nature 
and evidence of the doctrine 

 to a certain extent the doctrine of the attraction 
of bodies according to the law of the inverse square of 
the distance exhibits in its progress among men the same 
general features which we have noticed in the history 
of the laws of motion this doctrine was maintained 
a priori on the ground of its simplicity and asserted 
positively even before it was clearly understood not 
withstanding this anticipation its establishment on the 
ground of facts was a task of vast labour and sagacity 
when it had been so established in a general way there 
occurred at later periods an occasional suspicion that it 
might be approximately true only these suspicions led 
to further researches which showed the rule to be rigor 
ously exact and at present there are mathematicians 
who maintain not only that it is true but that it is a 
necessary property of matter a very few words on each 
of these points will suffice 

 i have shown in the history of science that the 
attraction of the sun according to the inverse square of 
the distance had been divined by bullialdus hooke hal 
ley and others before it was proved by newton pro 
bably the reason which suggested this conjecture was that 
gravity might be considered as a sort of emanation and 
that thus like light or any other effect diffused from a 

 vol ii 



establishment of universal gravitation 

centre it must follow the law just stated the efficacy of 
the force being weakened in receding from the centre 
exactly in proportion to the space througli which it is 
diffused it cannot be denied that such a view appears 
to be strongly recommended by analogy 

when it had been proved by newton that the planets 
were really retained in their elliptical orbits by a central 
force his calculations also showed that the abovestated 
law of the force must be at least very approximately 
correct since otherwise the aphelia of the orbits could 
not be so nearly at rest as they were yet when it 
seemed as if the motion of the moons apogee could not 
be accounted for without some new supposition the a 
priori argument in favour of the inverse square did not 
prevent clairaut from trying the hypothesis of a small 
term added to that which expressed the ancient law but 
when in order to test the accuracy of this hypothesis the 
calculation of the motion of the moons apogee was 
pushed to a greater degree of exactness than had been 
obtained before it was found that the new term vanished 
of itself and that the inverse square now accounted for 
tke whole of the motion and thus as in the case of 
the second law of motion the most scrupulous examina 
tion terminated in showing the simplest rule to be rigor 
ously true 

 similar events occurred in the history of another part 
of the law of gravitation namely that the attraction is pro 
portional to the quantity of matter attracted this part of 
the law may also be thus stated that the weight of bodies 
arising from gravity is proportional to their inertia and 
thus that the accelerating force on all bodies under the 
same circumstances is the same newton made experi 
ments which proved this with regard to terrestrial bodies 
for he found that at the end of equal strings balls of all 
substances gold silver lead glass wood c oscillated 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

in equal times but a few years ago doubts arose 
among the german astronomers whether this law was 
rigorously true with regard to the planetary bodies 
some calculations appeared to prove that the attraction 
of jupiter as shown by the perturbations which he pro 
duces in the small planets juno vesta and pallas was 
different from the attraction which he exerts on his 
own satellites nor did there appear to these philoso 
phers anything inconceivable in the supposition that the 
attraction of a planet might be thus elective but when 
mr airy obtained a more exact determination of the 
mass of jupiter as indicated by his effect on his satel 
lites it was found that this suspicion was unfounded 
and that there was in this case no exception to the 
universality of the rule that this cosmical attraction is in 
the proportion of the attracted mass 

 again when it had thus been shown that a mutual 
attraction of parts according to the law above mentioned 
prevailed throughout the extent of the solar system it 
might still be doubted whether the same law extended 
to other regions of the universe it might have been 
perhaps imagined that each fixed star had its peculiar 
law of force but the examination of the motions of 
double stars about each other by the two herschels and 
others appears to show that they describe ellipses as the 
planets do and thus extends the law of the inverse 
squares to parts of the universe immeasurably distant 
from the whole solar system 

 since every doubt which lias been raised with 
regard to the universality and accuracy of the law of 
gravitation has thus ended in confirming the rule it is 
not surprising that mens minds should have returned 
with additional force to those views which had at first 
represented the law as a necessary truth capable of being 

 princ in prop 



establishment of universal gravitation 

established by reason alone when it had been proved 
by newton that gravity is really a universal attribute of 
matter as far as we can learn his pupils were not content 
without maintaining it be an essential quality this is 
the doctrine held by cotes in the preface to the second 
edition of the principia gravity he says is 
a primary quality of bodies as extension mobility and 
impenetrability are but newton himself by no means 
went so far in his second letter to bentley he 
says you sometimes speak of gravity as essential and 
inherent to matter pray do not ascribe that notion to 
me the cause of gravity he adds i do not pretend 
to know and would take more time to consider of it 

cotes maintains his opinion by urging that we learn 
by experience that all bodies possess gravity and that we 
do not learn in any other way that they are extended 
moveable or solid but we have already seen that the 
ideas of space time and reaction on which depend 
extension mobility and solidity are not results but con 
ditions of experience we cannot conceive a body 
except as extended we cannot conceive it to exert 
mechanical action except with some kind of solidity 
but so far as our conceptions of body have hitherto been 
developed we find no difficulty in conceiving two bodies 
which do not attract each other 

 newton lays down in the second edition of the 
principia this rule of philosophizing book iii that 
 the qualities of bodies which cannot be made more or 
less intense and which belong to all bodies on which we 
are able to make experiments are to be held to be quali 
ties of all bodies in general and this rule is cited in 
the sixth proposition of the third book of the principia 
cor in order to prove that gravity proportional to 
the quantity of matter may be asserted to be a quality of 
all bodies universally but we may remark that a rule 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

of philosophizing itself of precarious authority cannot 
authorize us in ascribing universality to an empirical 
result geometrical and statical properties are seen to 
be necessary and therefore universal but newton appears 
disposed to assert a like universality of gravity quite 
unconnected with any necessity it would be a very 
inadequate statement indeed a false representation of 
statical truth if we were to say that because every body 
which has hitherto been tried has been found to have a 
centre of gravity we venture to assert that all bodies 
whatever have a centre of gravity and if we are ever 
able to assert the absolute universality of the law of gra 
vitation we shall have to rest this truth upon the clearer 
development of our ideas of matter and force not upon a 
rule of philosophizing which till otherwise proved must 
be a mere rule of prudence and which the opponent may 
refuse to admit 

 other persons instead of asserting gravity to be 
in its own nature essential to matter have made hypo 
theses concerning some mechanism or other by which 
this mutual attraction of bodies is produced thus the 
cartesians ascribed to a vortex the tendency of bodies to 
a centre newton himself seems to have been disposed 
to refer this tendency to the elasticity of an ether le 
sage propounded a curious hypothesis in which this 
attraction is accounted for by the impulse of infinite 
streams of particles flowing constantly through the uni 
verse in all directions in these speculations the force 
of gravity is resolved into the pressure or impulse of 
solids or fluids on the other hand hypotheses have 
been propounded in which the solidity and other phy 
sical qualities of bodies have been explained by repre 
senting the bodies as a collection of points from which 

 see vince observations on the hypotheses respecting gravitation 
and the critique of that vyork edinb rev vol xiii 



establishment of universal gravitation 

points repulsive as well as attractive forces emanate 
this view of the constitution of bodies was maintained 
and developed by boscovich and is hence termed bos 
covichs theory and the discussion of it will more pro 
perly come under our review at a future period when we 
speak of the question whether bodies are made up of 
atoms but we may observe that newton himself 
appears to have inclined as his followers certainly did to 
this mode of contemplating the physical properties of 
bodies in his preface to the principia after speaking 
of the central forces which are exhibited in cosmical phe 
nomena he says would that we could derive the 
other phenomena of nature from mechanical principles 
by the same mode of reasoning for many things move 
me so that i suspect all these phenomena may depend 
upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies 
through causes not yet known are either impelled to 
each other and cohere according to regular figures or are 
repelled and recede from each other which forces being 
unknown philosophers have hitherto made their attempts 
upon nature in vain 

 but both these hypotheses that by which cohe 
sion and solidity are reduced to attractive and repulsive 
forces and that by which attraction is reduced to the 
impulse and pressure of media are hitherto merely 
modes of representing mechanical laws of nature and 
cannot either of them be asserted as possessing any evi 
dent truth or peremptory authority to the exclusion of 
the other this consideration may enable us to estimate 
the real weight of the difficulty felt in assenting to the 
mutual attraction of bodies not in contact with each 
other for it is often urged that this attraction of bodies 
at a distance is an absurd supposition 

the doctrine is often thus stigmatised both by popu 
lar and by learned writers it was long received as a 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

maxim in philosophy as monboddo informs us that a 
body cannot act where it is not any more than when it is 
not but to this we reply that time is a necessary con 
dition of our conception of causation in a different man 
ner from space the action of force can only be con 
ceived as taking place in a succession of moments in 
each of which cause and effect immediately succeed each 
other and thus the interval of time between a cause and 
its remote effect is filled up by a continuous succession of 
events connected by the same chain of causation but 
in space there is no such visible necessity of continuity 
the action and reaction may take place at a distance from 
each other all that is necessary being that they be equal 
and opposite 

undoubtedly the existence of attraction is rendered 
more acceptable to common apprehension by supposing 
some intermediate machinery a cord or rod or fluid 
by which the forces may be conveyed from one point to 
another but such images are rather fitted to satisfy 
those prejudices which arise from the earlier applica 
tion of our ideas of force than the real nature of those 
ideas if we suppose two bodies to pull each other by 
means of a rod or a cord we only suppose in addition to 
those equal and opposite forces acting upon the two 
bodies which forces are alone essential to mutual attrac 
tion a certain power of resisting transverse pressure at 
every point of the intermediate line which additional 
supposition is entirely useless and quite unconnected 
with the essential conditions of the case when the 
newtonians were accused of introducing into philosophy 
an unknown cause which they termed attraction they 
justly replied that they knew as much respecting attrac 
tion as their opponents did about impulse in each case

far as we clearly apprehend it under the conditions of 
those axioms of mechanical causation which form the 
basis of our science on such subjects 

having thus examined the degree of certainty and 
generality to which our knowledge of the law of universal 
gravitation has been carried by the progress of mechanical 
discovery and speculation up to the present time we 
might proceed to the other branches of science and 
examine in like manner their grounds and conditions 
but before we do this it will be worth our while to 
attend for a moment to the effect which the progress of 
mechanical ideas among mathematicians and mechanical 
philosophers has produced upon the minds of other per 
sons who share only in an indirect and derivative manner 
in the influence of science 



chapter x 

of the general diffusion of clear 
mechanical ideas 

 we have seen how the progress of knowledge 
upon the subject of motion and force has produced in 
the course of the worlds history a great change in the 
minds of acute and speculative men so that such per 
sons can now reason with perfect steadiness and precision 
upon subjects on which at first their thoughts were vague 
and confused and can apprehend as truths of complete 
certainty and evidence laws which it required great labour 
and time to discover this complete developement and 
clear manifestation of mechanical ideas has taken place 
only among mathematicians and philosophers but yet a 
progress of thought upon such subjects an advance from 
the obscure to the clear and from error to truth may be

traced in the world at large and among those who have 
not directly cultivated the exact sciences this diffused 
and collateral influence of science manifests itself 
although in a wavering and fluctuating manner by vari 
ous indications at various periods of literary history 
the opinions and reasonings which are put forth upon 
mechanical subjects and above all the adoption into com 
mon language of terms and phrases belonging to the 
prevalent mechanical systems exhibit to us the most pro 
found discoveries and speculations of philosophers in 
their effect upon more common and familiar trains of 
thought this effect is by no means unimportant and 
we shall point out some examples of such indications as 
we have mentioned 

 the discoveries of the ancients in speculative 
mechanics were as we have seen very scanty and hardly 
extended their influence to the unmathematical world 
yet the familiar use of the term centre of gravity 
preserved and suggested the most important part of what 
the greeks had to teach the other phrases which they 
employed as momentum energy virtue force and the 
like never had any exact meaning even among mathe 
maticians and therefore never in the ancient world be 
came the means of suggesting just habits of thought i 
have pointed out in the history of science several cir 
cumstances which appear to denote the general confusion 
of ideas which prevailed upon mechanical subjects during 
the times of the roman empire i have there taken as 
one of the examples of this confusion the fable narrated 
by pliny and others concerning the echinejs a small 
fish which was said to stop a ship merely by sticking 
to it this story was adduced as betraying the absence 
of any steady apprehension of the equality of action and 
reaction since the fish except it had some immoveable 
 hist ind scl i 



diffusion of clear mechanical ideas 

obstacle to hold by must be pulled forward by the ship 
as much as it pulled the ship backward if the writers 
who speak of this wonder had shown any perception of 
the necessity of a reaction either produced by the rapid 
motion of the fishs fins in the water or in any other way 
they would not be chargeable with this confusion of 
thought but from their expressions it is i think evident 
that they saw no such necessity their idea of mecha 
nical action was not sufficiently distinct to enable them 
to see the absurdity of supposing an intense pressure with 
no obstacle for it to exert itself against 

 we may trace in more modern times also indica 
tions of a general ignorance of mechanical truths thus 
the phrase of shooting at an object pointblank im 
plies the belief that a cannonball describes a path of 
which the first portion is a straight line this error was 
corrected by the true mechanical principles which galileo 
and his followers brought to light but these principles 
made their way to popular notice principally in conse 
quence of their application to the motions of the solar 
system and to the controversies which took place respect 
ing those motions thus by far the most powerful argu 
ment against the reception of the copernican system of 
the universe was that of those who asked why a stone 
dropt from a tower was not left behind by the motion of 
the earth the answer to this question now universally 

 see prof powell on the nature and evidence of the laws of 
motion reports of the ashmolean society oxford professor 
powell has made an objection to my use of this instance of confusion 
of thought the remark in the text seems to me to justify what i said 
in the history as an evidence that the fish was not supposed to pro 
duce its effect by its muscular power acting on the water we may take 
what pliny says nat hist xxxii domat niundi rabiem nullo 
suo labore non retinendo aut alio modo quam adhserendo and also 
what he states in another place ix that when it is preserved in 
pickle it may be used in recovering gold which has fallen into a deep

familiar involves a reference to the true doctrine of the 
composition of motions again keplers persevering 
and strenuous attempts to frame a physical theory of 
the universe were frustrated by his ignorance of the first 
law of motion which informs us that a body will retain 
its velocity without any maintaining force he proceeded 
upon the supposition that the suns force was requisite to 
keep up the motion of the planets as well as to deflect and 
modify it and he was thus led to a system which repre 
sented the sun as carrying round the planets in their 
orbits by means of a vortex produced by his revolution 
the same neglect of the laws of motion presided in the 
formation of descartes system of vortices although 
descartes had enunciated in words the laws of motion 
he and his followers showed that they had not the practi 
cal habit of referring to these mechanical principles and 
dared not trust the planets to move in free space without 
some surrounding machinery to support themf 

 when at last mathematicians following newton 
had ventured to consider the motion of each planet as a 
mechanical problem not different in its nature from the 
motion of a stone cast from the hand and when the 
solution of this problem and its immense consequences 
had become matters of general notoriety and interest 
the new views introduced as is usual new terms which 
soon became extensively current we meet with such 
phrases as flying off in the tangent and deflexion 
from the tangent with antitheses between centripetal 
and centrifugal force or between projectile and 
 central force centres of force disturbing forces

t i have in the history applied to descartes the character which 
bacon gives to aristotle audax simul et pavidus though he was 
bold enough to enunciate the laws of motion without knowing them 
aright he had not the courage to leave the planets to describe their 
orbits by the agency of those laws without the machinery of contact 



diffusion of clear mechanical ideas 

perturbations and perturbations of higher orders 
are not unfrequently spoken of and the expression to 
gravitate and the term universal gravitation acquired 
a permanent place in the language 

yet for a long time and even up to the present day 
we find many indications that false and confused appre 
hensions on such subjects are by no means extirpated 
arguments are urged against the mechanical system of 
the universe implying in the opponents an absence of all 
clear mechanical notions many of this class of writers 
retrograde to keplers point of view this is for example 
the case with lord monboddo who arguing on the as 
sumption that force is requisite to maintain as well as to 
deflect motion produced a series of attacks upon the 
newtonian philosophy which he inserted in his ancient 
metaphysics published in and the succeeding years 
this writer like kepler measures force by the velocity 
which the body has not by that which it gains such a 
use of language would prevent our obtaining any laws of 
motion at all accordingly the author in the very next 
page to that which i have just quoted abandons this mea 
sure of force and in curvilinear motion measures force 
by the fall from the extremity of the arc again in 
his objections to the received theory he denies that cur 
vilinear motion is compounded although his own mode of 
considering such motion assumes this composition in the 
only way in which it was ever intended by mathema 
ticians many more instances might be adduced to show 
that a want of cultivation of the mechanical ideas ren 
dered this philosopher incapable of judging of a mecha 
nical system 

the following extract from the ancient metaphy 
sics may be sufficient to show the value of the authors 
criticism on the subjects of which we are now speaking

his object is to prove that there do not exist a centripetal 
and a centrifugal force in the case of elliptical motion 
 let any man move in a circular or elliptical line described 
to him and he will find no tendency in himself either 
to the centre or from it much less both if indeed he 
attempt to make the motion with great velocity or if he 
do it carelessly and inattentively he may go out of the 
line either towards the centre or from it but this is to 
be ascribed not to the nature of the motion but to our 
infirmity or perhaps to the animal form which is more 
fitted for progressive motion in a right line than for any 
kind of curvilinear motion but this is not the case with 
a sphere or spheroid which is equally adapted to motion 
in all directions we need hardly remind the reader 
that the manner in which a man running round a small 
circle finds it necessary to lean inwards in order that 
there may be a centripetal inclination to counteract the 
centrifugal force is a standard example of our mechanical 
doctrines and this fact quite familiar in practice as well 
as theory is in direct contradiction of lord monboddos 
assertion 

 a similar absence of distinct mechanical thought 
appears in some of the most celebrated metaphysicians 
of germany i have elsewhere noted f the opinion ex 
pressed by hegel that the glory which belongs to kepler 
has been unjustly transferred to newton and i have 
suggested as the explanation of this mode of thinking 
that hegel himself in the knowledge of mechanical 
truth had not advanced beyond keplers point of view 
persons who possess conceptions of space and number 
but who have not learnt to deal with ideas of force and 
causation may see more value in the discoveries of kepler 
than in those of newton another exemplification of this 

 anc met vol i b ii c p

diffusion of clear mechanical ideas 

state of mind may be found in mr schellings specula 
tions for instance in his lectures on the method of aca 
demical study in the twelfth lecture on the study of 
physics and chemistry he says p what the 
mathematical natural philosophy has done for the know 
ledge of the laws of the universe since the time that they 
were discovered by his keplers godlike genius is as 
is well known this it has attempted a construction of 
those laws which according to its foundations is altoge 
ther empirical we may assume it as a general rule that 
in any proposed construction that which is not a pure 
general form cannot have any scientific import or truth 
the foundation from which the centrifugal motion of the 
bodies of the world is derived is no necessary form it is 
an empirical fact the newtonian attractive force even 
if it be a necessary assumption for a merely reflective 
view of the subject is still of no significance for the 
reason which recognises only absolute relations the 
grounds of the keplerian laws can be derived without 
any empirical appendage purely from the doctrine of 
ideas and of the two unities which are in themselves 
one unity and in virtue of which each being while it is 
absolute in itself is at the same time in the absolute and 
reciprocally 

it will be observed that in this passage our mecha 
nical laws are objected to because they are not necessary 
results of our ideas which however as we have seen 
according to the opinion of some eminent mechanical 
philosophers they are but to assume this evident 
necessity as a condition of every advance in science is 
to mistake the last perhaps unattainable step for the 
first which lies before our feet and without inquiring 
further about the doctrine of the two unities or the 
manner in which from that doctrine we may deduce the 
keplerian laws we may be well convinced that such a 

s 



go philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

doctrine cannot supply any sufficient reason to induce us 
to quit the inductive path by which all scientific truth 
up to the present time has been acquired 

c but without going to schools of philosophy oppo 
sed to the inductive school we may find many loose and 
vague habits of thinking on mechanical subjects among 
the common classes of readers and reasoners and there 
are some familiar modes of employing the phraseology of 
mechanical science which are in a certain degree charge 
able with inaccuracy and may produce or perpetuate 
confusion among such cases we may mention the way 
in which the centripetal and centrifugal forces and also 
the projectile and central forces of the planets are often 
compared or opposed such antitheses sometimes pro 
ceed upon the false notion that the two members of these 
pairs of forces are of the same kind whereas on the 
contrary the projectile force is a hypothetical impulsive 
force which may at some former period have caused the 
motion to begin while the central force is an actual 
force which must act continuously and during the whole 
time of the motion in order that the motion may go on 
in the curve in the same manner the centrifugal force 
is not a distinct force in a strict sense but only a certain 
result of the first law of motion measured by the portion 
of centripetal force which counteracts it comparisons 
of quantities so heterogenous imply confusion of thought 
and often suggest baseless speculations and imagined 
reforms of the received opinions 

 i might point out other terms and maxims in 
addition to those already mentioned which though for 
merly employed in a loose and vague manner are now 
accurately understood and employed by all just thinkers 
and thus secure and diffuse a right understanding of 
mechanical truths such are momentum inertia quantity 
of matter quantity of motion that force is proportional 



diffusion of clear mechanical ideas 

to its effects that action and reaction are equal that what 
is gained in force by machinery is lost in time that the 
quantity of motion in the world cannot be either increased 
or diminished when the expression of the truth thus 
becomes easy and simple clear and convincing the mean 
ings given to words and phrases by discoverers glide into 
the habitual texture of mens reasonings and the effect of 
the establishment of true mechanical principles is felt far 
from the school of the mechanician if these terms and 
maxims are understood with tolerable clearness they 
carry the influence of truth to those who have no direct 
access to its sources many an extravagant project in 
practical machinery and many a wild hypothesis in spe 
culative physics has been repressed by the general cur 
rency of such maxims as we have just quoted 

 indeed so familiar and evident are the elementary 
truths of mechanics when expressed in this simple form 
that they are received as truisms and men are disposed 
to look back with surprise and scorn at the speculations 
which were carried on in neglect of them the most 
superficial reasoner of modern times thinks himself enti 
tled to speak with contempt and ridicule of keplers 
hypothesis concerning the physical causes of the celestial 
motions and gives himself credit for intellectual supe 
riority because he sees as selfevident what such a man 
could not discover at all it is well for such a person to 
recollect that the real cause of his superior insight is not 
the preeminence of his faculties but the successful 
labours of those who have preceded him the language 
which he has learnt to use unconsciously has been adapted 
to and moulded on ascertained truths when he talks 
familiarly of accelerating forces and deflexions from the 
tangent he is assuming that which kepler did not know 
and which it cost galileo and his disciples so much labour

instrument of thought but it is also the nutriment of 
thought or rather it is the atmosphere in which thought 
lives a medium essential to the activity of our specu 
lative power although invisible and imperceptible in its 
operation and an element modifying by its qualities and 
changes the growth and complexion of the faculties 
which it feeds in this way the influence of preceding 
discoveries upon subsequent ones of the past upon the 
present is most penetrating and universal though most 
subtle and difficult to trace the most familiar words 
and phrases are connected by imperceptible ties with the 
reasonings and discoveries of former men and distant 
times their knowledge is an inseparable part of ours 
the present generation inherits and uses the scientific 
wealth of all the past and this is the fortune not only 
of the great and rich in the intellectual world of those 
who have the key to the ancient storehouses and who 
have accumulated treasures of their own but the 
humblest inquirer while he puts his reasonings into 
words benefits by the labours of the greatest discoverers 
when he counts his little wealth he finds that he has in 
his hands coins which bear the image and superscription of 
ancient and modern intellectual dynasties and that in 
virtue of this possession acquisitions are in his power 
solid knowledge within his reach which none could ever 
have attained to if it were not that the gold of truth 
once dug out of the mine circulates more and more 
widely among mankind 

 having so fully examined in the preceding in 
stances the nature of the progress of thought which 
science implies both among the peculiar cultivators of 
science and in that wider world of general culture which 
receives only an indirect influence from scientific disco 
veries we shall not find it necessary to go into the same 
extent of detail with regard to the other provinces of 



diffusion of clear mechanical ideas 

human knowledge in the case of the mechanical sci 
ences we have endeavoured to show not only that ideas 
are requisite in order to form into a science the facts 
which nature offers to us but that we can advance almost 
or quite to a complete identification of the facts with 
the ideas in the sciences to which we now proceed we 
shall not seek to fill up the chasm by which facts and 
ideas are separated but we shall endeavour to detect 
the ideas which our knowledge involves to show how 
essential these are and in some respects to trace the 
mode in which they have been gradually developed among 
men 

 the motions of the heavenly bodies their laws 
their causes are among the subjects of the first division 
of the mechanical sciences and of these sciences we 
formerly sketched the history and have now endeavoured 
to exhibit the philosophy if we were to take any other 
class of motions their laws and causes might give rise to 
sciences which would be mechanical sciences in exactly 
the same sense in which physical astronomy is so the 
phenomena of magnets of electrical bodies of galvanical 
apparatus seem to form obvious materials for such sci 
ences and if they were so treated the philosophy of 
such branches of knowledge would naturally come under 
our consideration at this point of our progress 

but on looking more attentively at the sciences of 
electricity magnetism and galvanism we discover cogent 
reasons for transferring them to another part of our 
arrangement we find it advisable to associate them with 
chemistry and to discuss their principles when we can 
connect them with the principles of chemical science for 
though the first steps and narrower generalizations of 
these sciences depend upon mechanical ideas the highest 
laws and widest generalizations which we can reach 
respecting them involve chemical relations the pro 



 philosophy of the mechanical sciences 

gress of these portions of knowledge is in some respects 
opposite to the progress of physical astronomy in 
this we begin with phenomena which appear to indicate 
peculiar and various qualities in the bodies which we 
consider namely the heavenly bodies and we find in 
the end that all these qualities resolve themselves into 
one common mechanical property which exists alike in 
all bodies and parts of bodies on the contrary in 
studying magnetical and electrical laws we appear at first 
to have a single extensive phenomenon attraction and 
repulsion but in our attempts to generalize this pheno 
menon we find that it is governed by conditions depend 
ing upon something quite separate from the bodies them 
selves upon the presence and distribution of peculiar and 
transitory agencies and so far as we can discover the 
general laws of these agencies are of a chemical nature 
and are brought into action by peculiar properties of 
special substances in cosmical phenomena everything in 
proportion as it is referred to mechanical principles tends 
to simplicity to permanent uniform forces to one 
common positive property in magnetical and electrical 
appearances on the contrary the application of mecha 
nical principles leads only to a new complexity which 
requires a new explanation and this explanation involves 
changeable and various forces gradations and opposi 
tions of qualities the doctrine of the universal gravita 
tion of matter is a simple and ultimate truth in which 
the mind can acquiesce and repose we rank gravity 
among the mechanical attributes of matter and we see 
no necessity to derive it from any ulterior properties 
gravity belongs to matter independent of any conditions 
but the conditions of magnetic or electrical activity 
require investigation as much as the laws of their 
action of these conditions no mere mechanical expla 
pation can be given we are compelled to take

with us chemical properties and relations also arid thus 
magnetism electricity galvanism are mechanicochemical 
sciences 

 before considering these therefore i shall treat 
of what i shall call secondary mechanical sciences by 
which expression i mean the sciences depending upon 
certain qualities which our senses discover to us in bodies 
optics which has visible phenomena for its subject 
acoustics the science of hearing the doctrine of heat 
a quality which our touch recognises to this last science 
i shall take the liberty of sometimes giving the name 
thermotics analogous to the names of the other two 
if our knowledge of the phenomena of smell and taste 
had been successfully cultivated and systematized the 
present part of our work would be the place for the phi 
losophical discussion of those sensations as the subjects 
of science 

the branches of knowledge thus grouped in one class 
involve common fundamental ideas from which their 
principles are derived in a mode analogous at least in a 
certain degree to the mode in which the principles of 
the mechanical sciences are derived from the fundamental 
ideas of causation and reaction we proceed now to 
consider these fundamental ideas their nature develop 
ment and consequences

chapter i 

of the idea of a medium as commonly 
employed 

 of primary and secondary qualities in the same 
way in which the mechanical sciences depend upon the 
idea of cause and have their principles regulated by 
the development of that idea it will be found that the 
sciences which have for their subject sound light and 
heat depend for their principles upon the fundamental 
idea of media by means of which we perceive those 
qualities like the idea of cause this idea of a medium 
is unavoidably employed more or less distinctly in the 
common unscientific operations of the understanding 
and is recognised as an express principle in the earliest 
speculative essays of man but here also as in the case 
of the mechanical sciences the developement of the idea 
and the establishment of the scientific truths which 
depend upon it was the business of a succeeding period 
and was only executed by means of long and laborious 
researches conducted with a constant reference to experi 
ment and observation 

among the most prominent manifestations of the 
influence of the idea of a medium of which we have now 
to speak is the distinction of the qualities into primary 



of the idea of a medium 

and secondary qualities this distinction has been con 
stantly spoken of in modern times yet it has often been 
a subject of discussion among metaphysicians whether 
there be really such a distinction and what the true 
difference is locke states it thus original or primary 
qualities of body are such as are utterly inseparable 
from the body in what estate soever it may be such as 
sense constantly finds in every particle of matter which 
has bulk enough to be perceived and the mind finds 
inseparable from every particle of matter though less 
than to make itself singly perceived by our senses and 
he enumerates them as solidity extension figure motion 
or rest and number secondary qualities on the other 
hand are such which in truth are nothing in the objects 
themselves but powers to produce various sensations in 
us by their primary qualities i e by the bulk figure 
texture and motion of their insensible parts as colours 
sounds tastes c 

dr reidf reconsidering this subject puts the differ 
ence in another way there is he says a real foundation 
for the distinction of primary and secondary qualities and 
it is this that our senses give us a direct and distinct 
notion of the primary qualities and inform us what they 
are in themselves but of the secondary qualities our 
senses give us only a relative and obscure notion they 
inform us only that they are qualities that affect us in a 
certain manner that is produce in us a certain sensation 
but as to what they are in themselves our senses leave us 
in the dark 

dr brown states the distinction somewhat other 
wise we give the name of matter he observes to that 
which has extension and resistance these therefore are 
primary qualities of matter because they compose our 

 essay b ii ch s t essays b ii c 

f lectures ii 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

definition of it all other qualities are secondary since 
they are ascribed to bodies only because we find them 
associated with the primary qualities which form our 
notion of those bodies 

it is not necessary to criticise very strictly these vari 
ous distinctions if it were it would be easy to cavil at 
them thus locke it may be observed does not point 
out any reason for believing that his secondary qualities 
are produced by the primary how are we to learn that 
the colour of a rose arises from the bulk figure texture 
and motion of its particles certainly our senses do not 
teach us this and in what other way on lockes prin 
ciples can we learn it reids statement is not more 
free from the same objection how does it appear that 
our notion of warmth is relative to our own sensations 
more than our notion of solidity and if we take 
browns account we may still ask whether our selection 
of certain qualities to form our idea and definition of 
matter be arbitrary and without reason if it be how 
can it make a real distinction if it be not what is the 
reason 

i do not press these objections because i believe that 
any of the above accounts of the distinction of primary 
and secondary qualities is right in the main however im 
perfect it may be the difference between such qualities 
as extension and solidity on the one hand and colour or 
fragrance on the other is assented to by all with a con 
viction so firm and indestructible that there must be 
some fundamental principle at the bottom of the belief 
however difficult it may be to clothe the principle in 
words that successive efforts to express the real nature 
of the difference were made by men so clearsighted and 
acute as those whom i have quoted even if none of them 
are satisfactory shows how strong and how deeplyseated 
is the perception of truth which impels us to suclj 
attempts 



of the idea of a medium 

the most obvious mode of stating the difference of 
primary and secondary qualities as it naturally offers itself 
to speculative minds appears to be that employed by 
locke slightly modified certain of the qualities of 
bodies as their bulk figure and motion are perceived 
immediately in the bodies themselves certain other 
qualities as sound colour heat are perceived by means 
of some medium our conviction that this is the case 
is spontaneous and irresistible and this difference of 
qualities immediately and mediately perceived is the dis 
tinction of primary and secondary qualities we proceed 
further to examine this conviction 

 the idea of externality in reasoning concerning 
the secondary qualities of bodies we are led to assume 
the bodies to be external to us and to be perceived by 
means of some medium intermediate between us and 
them these assumptions are fundamental conditions of 
perception inseparable from it even in thought 

that objects are external to us that they are without 
us that they have outness is as clear as it is that these 
words have any meaning at all this conviction is in 
deed involved in the exercise of that faculty by which 
we perceive all things as existing in space for by this 
faculty we place ourselves and other objects in one com 
mon space and thus they are exterior to us it may be 
remarked that this apprehension of objects as external to 
us although it assumes the idea of space is far from 
being implied in the idea of space the objects which 
we contemplate are considered as existing in space and 
by that means become invested with certain mutual rela 
tions of position but when we consider them as existing 
without us we make the additional step of supposing 
ourselves and the objects to exist in one common space 
the question respecting the ideal theory of berkeley has 
been mixed up with the recognition of this condition of 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

the externality of objects that philosopher maintained 
as is well known that the perceptible qualities of bodies 
have no existence except in a perceiving mind this 
system has often been understood as if he had imagined 
the world to be a kind of optical illusion like the images 
which we see when we shut our eyes appearing to be 
without us though they are only in our organs and thus 
this ideal system has been opposed to a belief in an 
external world in truth however no such opposition 
exists the ideal system is an attempt to explain the 
mental process of perception and to get over the diffi 
culty of mind being affected by matter but the author 
of that system did not deny that objects were perceived 
under the conditions of space and mechanical causation 
that they were external and material so far as those 
words describe perceptible qualities berkeleys system 
however visionary or erroneous did not prevent his enter 
taining views as just concerning optics or acoustics as if 
he had held any other doctrine of the nature of perception 

but when berkeleys theory was understood as a 
denial of the existence of objects without us how was it 
answered if we examine the answers which are given 
by reid and other philosophers to this hypothesis it will 
be found that they amount to this that objects are with 
out us since we perceive that they are so that we per 
ceive them to be external by the same act by which we 
perceive them to be objects and thus in this stage of 
philosophical inquiry the externality of objects is recog 
nised as one of the inevitable conditions of our percep 
tion of them and hence the idea of externality is 
adopted as one of the necessary foundations of all reason 
ing concerning all objects whatever 

 sensation ly a medium objects as we have just 
seen are necessarily apprehended as without us and in 
general as removed from us by a great or small distance 



of the idea of a medium 

yet they affect our bodily senses and this leads us irre 
sistibly to the conviction that they are perceived by means 
of something intermediate vision or hearing or smell 
or the warmth of a fire must be communicated to us by 
some medium of sensation this unavoidable belief 
appears in all attempts the earliest and the latest alike 
to speculate upon such subjects thus for instance 
aristotle says seeing takes place in virtue of some 
action which the sentient organ suffers now it cannot 
suffer action from the colour of the object directly the 
only remaining possible case then is that it is acted upon 
by an intervening medium there must then be an inter 
vening medium and the same may be said he adds 
 concerning sounding and odorous bodies for these do 
not produce sensation by touching the sentient organ 
but the intervening medium is acted on by the sound or 
the smell and the proper organ by the medium in 
sound the medium is air in smell we have no name for 
it in the sense of taste the necessity of a medium 
is not at first so obviously seen because the object tasted 
is brought into contact with the organ but a little atten 
tion convinces us that the taste of a solid body can only 
be perceived when it is conveyed in some liquid vehicle 
till the fruit is crushed and till its juices are pressed out 
we do not distinguish its flavour in the case of heat it 
is still more clear that we are compelled to suppose some 
invisible fluid or other means of communication between 
the distant body which warms us and ourselves 

it may appear to some persons that the assumption 
of an intermedium between the object perceived and the 
sentient organ results from the principles which form the 
basis of our mechanical reasonings that every change 
must have a cause and that bodies can act upon each 
other only by contact it cannot be denied that this 

ii 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

principle does offer itself very naturally as the ground of 
our belief in media of sensation and it appears to be 
referred to for this purpose by aristotle in the passage 
quoted above but yet we cannot but ask does the 
principle that matter produces its effect by contact only 
manifestly apply here when we so apply it we include 
sensation among the effects which material contact pro 
duces a case so different from any merely mechanical 
effect that the principle so employed appears to acquire 
a new signification may we not then rather say that 
we have here a new axiom that sensation implies a 
material cause immediately acting on the organ than a 
new application of our former proposition that all 
mechanical change implies contact 

the solution of this doubt is not of any material con 
sequence to our reasonings for whatever be the ground 
of the assumption it is certain that we do assume the 
existence of media by which the sensations of sight 
hearing and the like are produced and it will be seen 
shortly that principles inseparably connected with this 
assumption are the basis of the sciences now before us 

this assumption makes its appearance in the physical 
doctrines of all the schools of philosophy it is exhibited 
perhaps most prominently in the tenets of the epicureans 
who were materialists and extended to all kinds of causa 
tion the axiom of the existence of a corporeal mechanism 
by which alone the effect is produced thus according to 
them vision is produced by certain images or material 
films which flow from the object strike upon the eyes 
and so become sensible this opinion is urged with 
great detail and earnestness by lucretius the poetical 
expositor of the epicurean creed among the romans 
his fundamental conviction of the necessity of a material 
medium is obviously the basis of his reasoning though he 
attempts to show the existence of such a medium by facts 



of the idea of a medium 

thus he argues that by shouting loud we make the 
throat sore which shows he says that the voice must be 
material so that it can hurt the passage in coming out 

hand igitur dubium est quin voces verbaque constent 
corporeis e principiis ut kedere possint 

 the process of perception of secondary qualities 
the likenesses or representatives of objects by which 
they affect our senses were called by some writers species 
or sensible species a term which continued in use till 
the revival of science it may be observed that the 
conception of these species as films cast off from the 
object and retaining its shape was different as we have 
seen from the view which aristotle took though it has 
sometimes been called the peripatetic doctrine f we may 
add that the expression was latterly applied to express 
the supposition of an emanation of any kind and implied 
little more than that supposition of a medium of which 
we are now speaking thus bacon after reviewing the 
phenomena of sound sayst videntur motus soni fieri 
per species spirituales ita enim loquendum donee certius 
quippiam inveniatur 

though the fundamental principles of several sciences 
depend upon the assumption of a medium of perception 
these principles do not at all depend upon any special 
view of the process of our perceptions the mechanism 
of that process is a curious subject of consideration but it 
belongs to physiology more properly than either to meta 
physics or to those branches of physics of which we are 
now speaking the general nature of the process is the 
same for all the senses the object affects the appropriate 
intermedium the medium through the proper organ 
the eye the ear the nose affects the nerves of the par

ticular sense and by these in some way the sensation 
is conveyed to the mind but to treat the impression 
upon the nerves as the act of sensation which we have to 
consider would be to mistake our object which is not the 
constitution of the human body but of the human mind 
it would be to mistake one link for the power which 
holds the end of the chain no anatomical analysis of 
the corporeal conditions of vision or hearing or feeling 
warm is necessary to the sciences of optics or acoustics 
or thermotics 

not only is this physiological research an extraneous 
part of our subject but a partial pursuit of such a research 
may mislead the inquirer we perceive objects by means 
of certain media and by means of certain impressions on 
the nerves but we cannot with propriety say that we 
perceive either the media or the impressions on the 
nerves what person in the act of seeing is conscious 
of the little coloured spaces on the retina or of the 
motions of the bones of the auditory apparatus whilst he 
is hearing surely no one this may appear obvious 
enough and yet a writer of no common acuteness dr 
brown has put forth several very strange opinions all 
resting upon the doctrine that the coloured spaces on the 
retina are the objects which we perceive and there are 
some supposed difficulties and paradoxes on the same 
subject which have become quite celebrated as upright 
vision with inverted images arising from the same con 
fusion of thought 

as the consideration of the difficulties which have 
arisen respecting the philosophy of perception may serve 
still further to illustrate the principles on which we 
necessarily reason respecting the secondary qualities of 
bodies i shall here devote a few pages to that subject 



 



chapter ii 

on peculiarities in the perceptions op 
the different senses 

 we cannot doubt that we perceive all secondary 
qualities by means of immediate impressions made 
through the proper medium of sensation upon our 
organs hence all the senses are sometimes vaguely 
spoken of as modifications of the sense of feeling it 
will however be seen on reflection that this mode of 
speaking identifies in words things which in our concep 
tions have nothing in common no impression on the 
organs of touch can be conceived as having any resem 
blance to colour or smell no effort no ingenuity can 
enable us to describe the impressions of one sense in 
terms borrowed from another 

the senses have however each its peculiar powers 
and these powers may be in some respects compared so 
as to show their leading resemblances and differences 
and the characteristic privileges and laws of each this 
is what we shall do as briefly as possible 

i prerogatives of sight the sight distinguishes 
colours as the hearing distinguishes tones the sight 
estimates degrees of brightness the ear degrees of loud 
ness but with several resemblances there are most 
remarkable differences between these two senses 

 position the sight has this peculiar prerogative 
that it apprehends the place of its objects directly and 
primarily we see where an object is at the same 
instant that we see what it is if we see two objects we 
see their relative position we cannot help perceiving 
that one is above or below to the right or to the left of 
the other if we perceive them at all 

t 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

there is nothing corresponding to this in sound 
when we hear a noise we do not necessarily assign a 
place to it it may easily happen that we cannot tell 
from which side a thnnderclap comes and though we 
often can judge in what direction a voice is heard this is a 
matter of secondary impression and of inference from con 
comitant circumstances not a primary fact of sensation 
the judgments which we form concerning the position of 
sounding bodies are obtained by the conscious or uncon 
scious comparison of the impressions made on the two ears 
and on the bones of the head in general they are not 
inseparable conditions of hearing we may hear sounds 
and be uncertain whether they are above around or 
imderneath but the moment any thing visible appears 
however unexpected we can say see where it comes 

since we can see the relative position of things we 
can see figure which is but the relative position of the 
different parts of the boundary of the object and thus 
the whole visible world exhibits to us a scene of various 
shapes coloured and shaded according to their form and 
position but each having relations of position to all the 
rest and altogether entirely filling up the whole range 
which the eye can command 

 distance the distance of objects from us is no 
matter of immediate perception but is a judgment and 
inference formed from our sensations in the same way as 
our judgment of position by the ear that this is so 
was most distinctly shown by berkeley in his new theory 
of vision the elements on which we form our judgment 
are the effort by which we fix both eyes on the same 
object the effort by which we adjust each eye to distinct 
vision and the known forms colours and parts of objects 
as compared with their appearance the right interpre 
tation of the information which these circumstances give 
us respecting the true distances and forms of things is 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

gradually learned by experience the lesson being begun 
in our earliest infancy and inculcated upon us every hour 
during which we use our eyes the completeness with 
which the lesson is learned is truly admirable for we for 
get that our conclusion is obtained indirectly and mistake 
a judgment on evidence for an intuitive perception this 
however is not more surprising than the rapidity and 
unconsciousness of effort with which we understand the 
meaning of the speech that we hear or the book that we 
read in both cases the habit of interpretation is become 
as familiar as the act of perception and this is the case 
with regard to vision we see the breadth of the street 
as clearly and readily as we see the house on the other 
side of it we see the house to be square however 
obliquely it be presented to us indeed the difficulty is 
to recover the consciousness of our real and original 
sensations to discover what is the apparent relation of 
the lines which appear before us as we have already 
said in the common process of vision we suppose our 
selves to see that which cannot be seen and when we 
would make a picture of an object the difficulty is to 
represent what is visible and no more 

but perfect as is our habit of interpreting what we 
perceive we could not interpret if we did not perceive 
if the eye did not apprehend visible position it could not 
infer actual position which is collected as a consequence 
if we did not see apparent figure we could not form any 
opinion concerning real form the perception of place 
which is the prerogative of the eye is the basis of all its 
other superiority 

the precision with which the eye can judge of apparent 
position is remarkable if we had before us two stars dis 
tant from each other by onetwentieth of the moons dia 
meter we could easily decide the apparent direction of the 
one from the other as above or below to the right or left 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

yet eight millions of stars might be placed in the visible 
hemisphere of the sky at such distances from each other 
and thus the eye would recognise the relative position in 
a portion of its range not greater than one eightmil 
lionth of the whole such is the accuracy of the sense 
of vision in this respect and indeed we might with 
truth have stated it much higher our judgment of the 
position of distant objects in a landscape depends upon 
features far more minute than the magnitude we have 
here stated 

as our object is to point out principally the differ 
ences of the senses we do not dwell upon the delicacy 
with which we distinguish tints and shades but proceed 
to another sense 

ii prerogatives of hearing the sense of hear 
ing has two remarkable prerogatives it can perceive a 
definite and peculiar relation between certain tones and 
it can clearly perceive two tones together in both these 
circumstances it is distinguished from vision and from 
the other senses 

 musical intervals we perceive that two tones 
have or have not certain definite relations to each other 
which we call concords one sound is a fifth an octave 
c above the other and when this is the case our per 
ception of the relation is extremely precise it is easy 
to perceive when a fifth is out of tune by onetwentieth 
of a tone that is by oneseventieth of itself to this 
there is nothing analogous in vision colours have cer 
tain vague relations to one another they look well 
together by contrast or by resemblance but this is an 
indefinite and in most cases a casual and variable feeling 
the relation of complementary colours to one another as 
of red to green is somewhat more definite but still has 
nothing of the exactness and peculiarity which belongs 
to a musical concord in the case of the two sounds 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

there is an exact point at which the relation obtains 
when by altering one note we pass this point the concord 
does not gradually fade away but instantly becomes a 
discord and if we go further still we obtain another 
concord of quite a different character 

we learn from the theory of sound that concords 
occur when the times of vibration of the notes have exact 
simple ratios an octave has these times as to a 
fifth as to according to the undulatory theory of 
light such ratios occur in colours yet the eye is not 
affected by them in any peculiar way the times of the 
undulations of certain red and violet rays are as to 
but we do not perceive any peculiar harmony or con 
nexion between those colours 

 chords again the ear has this prerogative that it 
can apprehend two notes together yet distinct if two 
notes distant by a fifth from each other are sounded on 
two wind instruments both they and their musical rela 
tion are clearly perceived there is not a mixture but 
a concord an interval in colours the case is otherwise 
if blue and yellow fall on the same spot they form green 
the colour is simple to the eye it can no more be 
decomposed by the vision than if it were the simple green 
of the prismatic spectrum it is impossible for us by 
sight to tell whether it is so or not 

these are very remarkable differences of the two 
senses two colours can be compounded into an appa 
rently simple one two sounds cannot colours pass into 
each other by gradations and intermediate tints sounds 
pass from one concord to another by no gradations the 
most intolerable discord is that whkh is near a concord 
we shall hereafter see how these differences affect the 
scales of sound and of colour 

 rhythm we might remark that as we see objects 
in space we hear sounds in time and that we thus intro 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

duce an arrangement among sounds which has several 
analogies with the arrangement of objects in space 
but the conception of time does not seem to be pecu 
liarly connected with the sense of hearing a faculty of 
apprehending tone and time or in musical phraseology 
tune and rhythm are certainly very distinct i shall not 
therefore here dwell upon such analogies 

the other senses have not any peculiar prerogatives 
at least none which bear on the formation of science i 
may however notice in the feeling of heat this circum 
stance that it presents us with two opposites heat and 
cold which graduate into each other this is not quite 
peculiar for vision also exhibits to us white and black 
which are clearly opposites and which pass into each 
other by the shades of gray 

 first paradox of vision upright vision all 
our senses appear to have this in common that 
they act by means of organs in which a bundle of nerves 
receives the impression of the appropriate medium of the 
sense in the construction of these organs there are 
great differences and peculiarities corresponding in part 
at least to the differences in the information given 
moreover in some cases as we have noted in the case of 
audible position and visible distance that which seems to 
be a perception is really a judgment founded on percep 
tions of which we are not directly aware it will be 
seen therefore that with respect to the peculiar powers 
of each sense it may be asked whether they can be 
explained by the construction of the peculiar organ 
whether they are acquired judgments and not direct per 
ceptions or whether they are inexplicable in either of 
these ways and cannot at present at least be resolved 
into anything but conditions of the intellectual act of 
perception 

two of these questions with regard to vision have 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

been much discussed by psychological writers the cause 
of our seeing objects upright by inverted images on the 
retina and of our seeing single with two such images 

physiologists have very completely explained the 
exquisitely beautiful mechanism of the eye considered 
as analogous to an optical instrument and it is in 
disputable that by means of certain transparent lenses 
and humours an inverted image of the objects which are 
looked at is formed upon the retina or fine network of 
nerve with which the back of the eye is lined we 
cannot doubt that the impression thus produced on these 
nerves is essential to the act of vision and so far as we 
consider the nerves themselves to feel or perceive by 
contact we may say that they perceive this image or the 
affections of light which it indicates but we cannot 
with any propriety say that we perceive or that our mind 
perceives this image for we are not conscious of it and 
none but anatomists are aware of its existence we 
perceive by means of it 

a difficulty has been raised and dwelt upon in a 
most unaccountable manner arising from the neglect of 
this obvious distinction it has been asked how is it 
that we see an object a man for instance upright when 
the immediate object of our sensation the image of the 
man on our retina is inverted to this we must answer 
that we see him upright because the image is inverted 
that the inverted image is the necessary means of seeing 
an upright object this is granted and where then is 
the difficulty perhaps it may be put thus how is it 
that we do not judge the man to be inverted since the 
sensible image is so to this we may reply that we 
have no notion of upright or inverted except that which 
is founded on experience and that all our experience 
without exception must have taught us that such a 
sensible image belongs to a man who is in an upright 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

position indeed the contrary judgment is not con 
ceivable a man is upright whose head is upwards and 
his feet downwards but what are the sensible images 
of upwards and downwards f whatever be our standard 
of up and down the sensible representation of up will be 
an image moving on the retina towards the lower side 
and the sensible representation of down will be a motion 
towards the upper side the head of the mans image is 
towards the image of the sky its feet are towards the 
image of the ground how then should it appear other 
wise than upright but perhaps we expect that the 
whole world should appear inverted but if the whole 
be inverted how is the relation of the parts altered 
or we expect that we should think our own persons 
inverted yet this cannot be for we look at them 
as we do at other objects or perhaps we expect 
that things should appear to fall upwards yet what do 
we know of upwards except that it is the direction 
in which bodies do not fall in short the whole 
of this difficulty though it has in no small degree em 
barrassed metaphysicians appears to result from a very 
palpable confusion of ideas from an attempt at com 
parison of what we see with that which the retina feels 
as if they were separately presentable it is a sufficient 
explanation to say that we do not see the image on the 
retina but see by means of it the perplexity does not 
require much more skill to disentangle than it does to 
see that a word written in black ink may signify white 

 second paradox of vision single vision 
 small or distant objects the other difficulty why 
with two images on the retina we see only one object is 
of a much more real and important kind this effect is 
manifestly limited by certain circumstances of a very 
precise nature for if we direct our eyes at an object 
which is very near the eye we see all other objects 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

double the fact is not therefore that we are incapable 
of receiving two impressions from the two images but 
that under certain conditions the two impressions form 
one a little attention shows us that these conditions 
are that with both eyes we should look at the same 
object and again we find that to look at an object with 
either eye is to direct the eye so that the image falls on 
or near a particular point about the middle of the retina 
thus these middle points in the two retinas correspond 
and we see an image single when the two images fall on 
the corresponding points 

again as each eye judges of position and as the two 
eyes judge similarly an object will be seen in the same 
place by one eye and by the other when the two images 
which it produces are similarly situated with regard to 
the corresponding points of the retina 

this is the law of single vision at least so far as 
regards small objects namely objects so small that in con 
templating them we consider their position only and not 
their solid dimensions the law is a distinct and original 
principle of our constitution and it is a mistake to call in 
as some have done the influence of habit and of acquired 
judgments in order to determine the result in such cases 

to ascribe the apparent singleness of objects to the 
impressions of vision corrected by the experience of 
touch would be to assert that a person who had not 
been in the habit of handling what lie saw would see all 
objects double and also to assert that a person begin 
ning with the double world which vision thus offers to 
him would by the continued habit of handling objects 
gradually and at last learn to see them single but all 
the facts of the case show such suppositions to be 
utterly fantastical no one can in this case go back 
from the habitual judgment of the singleness of objects 

 ee brown vol ii p 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

to the original and direct perception of their doubleness 
as the draughtsman goes back from judgments to per 
ception in representing solid distances and forms by 
means of perspective pictures no one can point out 
any case in which the habit is imperfectly formed even 
children of the most tender age look at an object with 
both eyes and see it as one 

in cases when the eyes are distorted in squinting 
one eye only is used or if both are employed there is 
double vision and thus any derangement of the corre 
spondence of motion in the two eyes will produce double 
sightedness 

brown is one of those who assert that two images 
suggest a single object because we have always found 
two images to belong to a single object he urges as 
an illustration that the two words he conquered 
by custom excite exactly the same notion as the one 
latin word vicit and thus that two visual images 
by the effect of habit produce the same belief of a 
single object as one tactual impression but in order 
to make this pretended illustration of any value it ought 
to be true that when a person has thoroughly learnt 
the latin language he can no longer distinguish any 
separate meaning in he and in conquered we can 
by no effort perceive the double sensation when we 
look at the object with the two eyes those who squint 
learn by habit to see objects single but the habit which 
they acquire is that of attending to the impressions of 
one eye only at once not of combining the two impres 
sions it is obvious that if each eye spreads before us 
the same visible scene with the same objects and the 
same relations of place then if one object in each scene 
coincide the whole of the two visible impressions will be 
coincident and here the remarkable circumstance is 
 lectures vol ii p 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

that not only each eye judges for itself of the relations of 
position which come within its field of view but that 
there is a superior and more comprehensive faculty 
which combines and compares the two fields of view 
which asserts or denies their coincidence which con 
templates as in a relative position to one another these 
two visible worlds in which all other relative position is 
given this power of confronting two sets of visible 
images and figured spaces before a purely intellectual 
tribunal is one of the most remarkable circumstances in 
the sense of vision 

 near objects we have hitherto spoken of the 
singleness of objects whose images occupy corresponding 
positions on the retina of the two eyes but here occurs 
a difficulty if an object of moderate size a small thick 
book for example be held at a little distance from the 
eyes it produces an image on the retina of each eye and 
these two images are perspective representations of the 
book from different points of view the positions of the 
two eyes and are therefore of different forms hence 
the two images cannot occupy corresponding points of 
the retina throughout their whole extent if the central 
parts of the two images occupy corresponding points the 
boundaries of the two will not correspond how is it 
then consistent with the law above stated that in this 
case the object appears single 

it may be observed that the two images in such a 
case will differ most widely when the object is not a 
mere surface but a solid if a book for example be 
held with one of its edges towards the face the right eye 
will see one side more directly than the left eye and 
the left eye will see another side more directly and the 
outline of the two images upon the two retinas will ex 
hibit this difference and it may be further observed 
that this difference in the images received by the two 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

eyes is a plain and demonstrative evidence of the solidity 
of the object seen since nothing but a solid object 
could without some special contrivance produce these 
different forms of the images in the two eyes 

hence the absence of exact coincidence in the two 
images on the retina is the necessary condition of the 
solidity of the object seen and must be one of the indi 
cations by means of which our vision apprehends an 
object as solid and that this is so mr wheatstone 
has proved experimentally by means of some most 
ingenious and striking contrivances he has devised 
an instrument by which two images drawn in outline 
differing exactly as much as the two images of a solid 
body seen near the face would differ are conveyed 
one to one eye and the other to the other and it is 
found that when this is effected the object which the 
images represent is not only seen single but is appre 
hended as solid with a clearness and reality of conviction 
quite distinct from any impression which a mere per 
spective representation can give 

at the same time it is found that the object is then 
only apprehended as single when the two images are 
such as are capable of being excited by one single object 
placed in solid space and seen by the two eyes if the 
images differ more or otherwise than this condition 
allows the result is that both are seen their lines cross 
ing and interfering with one another 

it may be observed too that if an object be of such 
large size as not to be taken in by a single glance of the 
eyes it is no longer apprehended as single by a direct act 
of perception but its parts are looked at separately and 
successively and the impressions thus obtained are put 
together by a succeeding act of the mind hence the 
objects which are directly seen as solid will be of mode 

 phil trans 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

rate size in which case it is not difficult to show that 
the outlines of the two images will differ from each other 
only slightly 

hence we are led to the following as the law of 
single vision for near objects when the two images 
in the two eyes are situated part for part nearly but not 
exactly upon corresponding points the object is appre 
hended as single if the two images are such as are or would 
be given by a single solid object seen by the two eyes 
separately and in this case the object is necessarily 
apprehended as solid 

this law of vision does not contradict that stated 
above for distant objects for when an object is removed 
to a considerable distance the images in the two eyes 
coincide exactly and the object is seen as single though 
without any direct apprehension of its solidity the first 
law is a special case of the second under the condition 
of exactly corresponding points we have the perception 
of singleness but no evidence of solidity under the 
condition of nearly corresponding points we may have 
the perception of singleness and with it of solidity 

we have before noted it as an important feature in 
our visual perception that while we have two distinct 
impressions upon the sense which we can contemplate 
separately and alternately the impressions on the two 
eyes we have a higher perceptive faculty which can 
recognise these two impressions exactly similar to each 
other as only two images of one and the same assemblage 
of objects but we now see that the faculty by which 
we perceive visible objects can do much more than this 
it can not only unite two impressions and recognise 
them as belonging to one object in virtue of their coin 
cidence but it can also unite and identify them even 
when they do not exactly coincide it can correct and 
adjust their small difference so that they are both appre 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

hended as representations of the same figure it can 
infer from them a real form not agreeing with either of 
them and a solid space which they are quite incapable 
of exemplifying the visual faculty decides whether or 
not the two ocular images can be pictures of the same 
solid object and if they can it undoubtingly and neces 
sarily accepts them as being so this faculty operates as 
if it had the power of calling before it all possible solid 
figures and of ascertaining by trial whether any of those 
will at the same time fit both the outlines which are 
given by the sense it assumes the reality of solid space 
and if it be possible reconciles the appearances with that 
reality and thus an activity of the mind of a very 
remarkable and peculiar kind is exercised in the most 
common act of seeing 

 it may be said that this doctrine of such a visual 
faculty as has been described is very vague and obscure 
since we are not told what are its limits it adjusts and 
corrects figures which nearly coincide so as to identify 
them but how nearly it may be asked must the figures 
approach each other in order that this adjustment may 
be possible what discrepance renders impossible the 
reconcilement of which we speak is it not impossible 
to give a definite answer to these questions and therefore 
impossible to lay down definitely such laws of vision as 
we have stated to this i reply that the indefiniteness 
thus objected to us is no new difficulty but one with 
which philosophers are familiar and to which they are 
already reconciled it is in fact no other than the 
indefiniteness of the limits of distinct vision how near 
to the face must an object be brought so that we shall 
cease to see it distinctly the distance it will be 
answered is indefinite it is different for different per 
sons and for the same person it varies with the degree 
of effort attention and habit but this indefiniteness is 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

only the indefiniteness in another form of the deviation 
of the two ocular images from one another and in reply 
to the question concerning them we must still say as 
before that in doubtful cases the power of apprehending 
an object as single when this can be done will vary with 
effort attention and habit the assumption that the 
apparent object exists as a real figure in real space is to 
be verified if possible but in extreme cases from the 
unfitness of the point of view or from any other cause of 
visual confusion or deception the existence of a real 
object corresponding to the appearance may be doubtful 
as in any other kind of perception it may be doubtful 
whether our senses under disadvantageous circumstances 
give us true information the vagueness of the limits 
then within which this visual faculty can be successfully 
exercised is no valid argument against the existence of 
the faculty or the truth of the law which we have stated 
concerning its action 

 visible figure there is one tenet on the 
subject of vision which appears to me so extravagant 
and unphilosophical that i should not have thought it 
necessary to notice it if it bad not been recently pro 
mulgated by a writer of great acuteness in a book which 
has obtained for a metaphysical work considerable cir 
culation i speak of browns opinion that we have no 
immediate perception of visible figure i confess myself 
unable to comprehend fully the doctrine which he would 
substitute in the place of the one commonly received he 
states it thusf when the simple affection of sight is 
blended with the ideas of suggestion those arising from 
touch c in what are termed the acquired perceptions 
of vision as for example in the perception of a sphere 
it is colour only which is blended with the large con 
vexity and not a small coloured plane the doctrine

vol i u

which brown asserts in this and similar passages appears 
to be that we do not by vision perceive both colour and 
figure but that the colour which we see is blended with 
the figure which we learn the existence of by other 
means as by touch but if this were possible when we 
can call in other perceptions how is it possible when we 
cannot or do not touch the object why does the 
moon appear round gibbous or horned what sense 
besides vision suggests to us the idea of her figure and 
even in objects which we can reach what is that circum 
stance in the sense of vision which suggests to us that 
the colour belongs to the sphere except that we see the 
colour where we see the sphere if we do not see figure 
we do not see position for figure is the relative position 
of the parts of a boundary if we do not see position 
why do we ascribe the yellow colour to the sphere on our 
left rather than to the cube on our right we associate 
the colour with the object says dr brown but if his 
opinion were true we could not associate two colours 
with two objects for we could not apprehend the colours 
as occupying two different places 

the whole of browns reasoning on this subject is so 
irreconcileable with the first facts of vision that it is 
difficult to conceive how it could proceed from a person 
who has reasoned with great acuteness concerning touch 
in order to prove his assertion he undertakes to examine 
the only reasons which he says he can imagine for 
believing the immediate perception of visible figure 
that it is absolutely impossible in our present sensations 
of sight to separate colour from extension and that 
there are in fact figures on the retina corresponding to 
the apparent figures of objects 

on the subject of the first reason he says that the 
figure which we perceive as associated with colour is the 
real and not the apparent figure is there he asks 
 lectures vol ii p 



 peculiarities of the perceptions 

the slightest consciousness of a perception of visible 
figure corresponding to the affected portion of the 
retina to which though he seems to think an affirma 
tive answer impossible we cannot hesitate to reply that 
there is undoubtedly such a consciousness that though 
obscured by being made the ground of habitual inference 
as to the real figure this consciousness is constantly 
referred to by the draughtsmen and easily recalled by 
any one we may separate colour he says again 
from the figures on the retina as we may separate it from 
length breadth and thickness which we do not see but 
this is altogether false we cannot separate colour from 
length breadth and thickness in any other way than 
by transferring it to the visible figure which we do 
see he cannot he allows separate the colour from 
the visible form of the trunk of a large oak but just as 
little he thinks can he separate it from the convex mass 
of the trunk which it is allowed on all hands he does not 
immediately see but in this he is mistaken for if he 
were to make a picture of the oak he would separate the 
colour from the convex shape which he does not imitate 
but he could not separate it from the visible figure which 
he does imitate and he would then perceive that the 
fact that he has not an immediate perception of the con 
vex form is necessarily connected with the fact that he 
has an immediate perception of the apparent figure so 
far is the rejection of immediate perception in the former 
case from being a reason for rejecting it in the latter 

again with regard to the second argument it does 
not he says follow that because a certain figured portion 
of the retina is affected by light we should see such a 
figure for if a certain figured portion of the olfactory 
organ were affected by odours we should not acquire by 
smell any perception of such figuref this is merely to 

 lectures vol ii p t p 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

say that because we do not perceive position and figure 
by one sense we cannot do so by another but this 
again is altogether erroneous it is an office of our 
sight to inform us of position and consequently of figure 
for this purpose the organ is so constructed that the 
position of the object determines the position of the 
point of the retina affected there is nothing of this 
kind in the organ of smell objects in different positions 
and of different forms do not affect different parts of the 
olfactory nerve or portions of different shape different 
objects remote from each other if perceived by smell 
affect the same part of the olfactory organs this is all 
quite intelligible for it is not the office of smell to 
inform us of position of what use or meaning would 
be the curious and complex structure of the eye if it 
gave us only such vague and wandering notions of the 
colours and forms of the flowers in a garden as we 
receive from their odours when we walk among them 
blindfold it is as we have said the prerogative of 
vision to apprehend position the places of objects on 
the retina give this information we do not suppose 
that the affection of a certain shape of nervous expanse 
will necessarily and in all cases give us the impression of 
figure but we know that in vision it does and it is 
clear that if we did not acquire our acquaintance with 
visible figure in this way we could not acquire it in 
any way 

the whole of this strange mistake of browns appears 
to arise from the fault already noticed that of consi 
dering the image on the retina as the object instead of 

 when brown says further p that we can indeed show the 
image in the dissected eye but that it is not in the dissected eye 
that vision takes place it is difficult to see what his drift is does 
he doubt that there is an image formed in the living as completely as 
in the dissected eye 



peculiarities of the perceptions 

the means of vision this indeed is what he says the 
true object of vision is not the distant body itself but 
the light that has reached the expansive termination of 
the optic nerve even if this were so we do not see 
why we should not perceive the position of the impression 
on this expanded nerve but as we have already said 
the impression on the nerve is the means of vision and 
enables us to assign a place or at least a direction to the 
object from which the light proceeds and thus makes 
vision possible brown indeed pursues his own peculiar 
view till he involves the subject in utter confusion thus 
he saysf according to the common theory that 
figure can be perceived by the eye a visible sphere is at 
once to my perception convex and plane and if the 
sphere be a large one it is perceived at once to be a 
sphere of many feet in diameter and a plane circular 
surface of the diameter of a quarter of an inch it is 
easy to deduce these and greater absurdities if we pro 
ceed on his strange and baseless supposition that the 
object and the image on the retina are loth perceived 
but who is conscious of the image on the retina in any 
other way than as he sees the object by means of it 

brown seems to have imagined that he was ana 
lysing the perception of figure in the same manner in 
which berkeley had analysed the perception of distance 
he ought to have recollected that such an undertaking 
to be successful required him to show what elements he 
analysed it into berkeley analysed the perception of 
real figure into the interpretation of visible figure accord 
ing to certain rules which he distinctly stated brown 
analyses the perception of visible figure into no elements 
berkeley says that we do not directly perceive distance 
but that we perceive something else from which we infer 
distance namely visible figure and colour and our own

efforts in seeing brown says that we do not see figure 
but infer it what then do we see which we infer it from 
to this he offers no answer he asserts the seeming 
perception of visible figure to be a result of associa 
tion of suggestion but what meaning can we 
attach to this suggestion requires something which 
suggests and not a hint is given what it is which sug 
gests position association implies two things asso 
ciated what is the sensation which we associate with 
form what is that visual perception which is not 
figure and which we mistake for figure what percep 
tion is it that suggests a square to the eye what im 
pressions are those which have been associated with a 
visible triangle so that the revival of the impressions 
revives the notion of the triangle brown has nowhere 
pointed out such perceptions and impressions nor indeed 
was it possible for him to do so for the only visual per 
ceptions which he allows to remain those of colour most 
assuredly do not suggest visible figures by their differ 
ences red is not associated with square rather than with 
round or with round rather than square on the con 
trary the eye constructed in a very complex and wonderful 
manner in order that it may give to us directly the per 
ception of position as well as of colour has it for one of its 
prerogatives to give us this information and the percep 
tion of the relative position of each part of the visible 
boundary of an object constitutes the perception of its 
apparent figure which faculty we cannot deny to the eye 
without rejecting the plain and constant evidence of our 
senses making the mechanism of the eye unmeaning 
confounding the object with the means of vision and 
rendering the mental process of vision utterly unintelli 
gible 

having sufficiently discussed the processes of percep 
tion i now return to the consideration of the ideas which 
these processes assume 



 



chapter iii 

successive attempts at the scientific 

application of the idea of a 

medium 

 in what precedes we have shown by various consi 
derations that we necessarily and universally assume the 
perception of secondary qualities to take place by means 
of a medium interjacent between the object and the 
person perceiving perception is affected by various 
peculiarities according to the nature of the quality per 
ceived but in all cases a medium is equally essential to 
the process 

this principle which as we have seen is accepted as 
evident by the common understanding of mankind is 
confirmed by all additional reflection and discipline of 
the mind and is the foundation of all the theories which 
have been proposed concerning the processes by which the 
perception takes place and concerning the modifications 
of the qualities thus perceived the medium and the 
mode in which the impression is conveyed through the 
medium seem to be different for different qualities but 
the existence of the medium leads to certain necessary 
conditions or alternatives which have successively made 
their appearance in science in the course of the attempts 
of men to theorize concerning the principal secondary 
qualities sound light and heat we must now point 
out some of the ways at first imperfect and erroneous 
in which the consequences of the fundamental assumption 
were traced 

 sound in all cases the medium of sensation 
whatever it is is supposed to produce the effect of con 
veying secondary qualities to our perception by means of 
its primary qualities it was conceived to operate by the 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

size form and motion of its parts this is a fundamental 
principle of the class of sciences of which we have at 
present to speak 

it was assumed from the first as we have seen in the 
passage lately quoted from aristotle that in the convey 
ance of sound the medium of communication was the air 
but although the first theorists were right so far that 
circumstance did not prevent their going entirely wrong 
when they had further to determine the nature of the 
process it was conceived by aristotle that the air acted 
after the manner of a rigid body like a staff which 
receiving an impulse at one end transmits it to the 
other now this is altogether an erroneous view of the 
manner in which the air conveys the impulse by which 
sound is perceived an approach was made to the true 
view of this process by assimilating it to the diffusion of 
the little circular waves which are produced on the sur 
face of still water when a stone is dropt into it these 
little waves begin from the point thus disturbed and run 
outwards expanding on every side in concentric circles 
till they are lost the propagation of sound through the 
air from the point where it is produced was compared 
by vitruvius to this diffusion of circular waves in water 
and thus the notion of a propagation of impulse by the 
waves of a fluid was introduced in the place of the former 
notion of the impulse of an unyielding body 

but though taking an enlarged view of the nature of 
the progress of a wave this is a just representation of the 
motion of air in conveying sound we cannot suppose that 
the process was at the period of which we speak rightly 
understood for the waves of water were contemplated 
only as affecting the surface of the water and as the air 
has no surface the communication must take place by 
means of an internal motion which can bear only a 
remote and obscure resemblance to the waves which we 

 supr p 



scientific application of the idea of a medium 

see and even with regard to the waves of water the 
mechanism by which they are produced and transferred 
was not at all understood so that the comparison 
employed by vitruvius must be considered rather as a 
loose analogy than as an exact scientific explanation 

no correct account of such motions was given till 
the formation of the science of mechanics in modern 
times had enabled philosophers to understand more dis 
tinctly the mode in which motion is propagated through 
a fluid and to discern the forces which the process calls 
into play so as to continue the motion once begun 
newton introduced into this subject the exact and rigor 
ous conception of an undulation which is the true key to 
the explanation of impulses conveyed through a fluid 

even at the present day the right apprehension of 
the nature of an undulation transmitted through a fluid 
is found to be very difficult for all persons except those 
whose minds have been duly disciplined by mathematical 
studies when we see a wave run along the surface of 
water we are apt to imagine at first that a portion of the 
fluid is transferred bodily from one place to another 
but with a little consideration we may easily satisfy our 
selves that this is not so for if we look at a field of 
standing corn when a breeze blows over it we see waves 
like those of water run along its surface yet it is clear 
that in this case the separate stalks of corn only bend 
backwards and forwards and no portion of the grain is 
really conveyed from one part of the field to the other 
this is obvious even to popular apprehension the poet 
speaks of 

the rye 

that stoops its head when whirlwinds rave 
and springs again in eddying wave 
as each wild gust sweeps by 

each particle of the mass in succession has a small 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

motion backwards and forwards and by this means a 
large ridge made by many such particles runs along the 
mass to any distance this is the general notion of an 
undulation 

thus when an undulation is propagated in a fluid 
it is not matter but form which is transmitted from one 
place to another the particles along the line of each 
wave assume a certain arrangement and this arrangement 
passes from one part to another the particles changing 
their places only within narrow limits so as to lend 
themselves successively to the arrangements by which 
the successive waves and the intervals between the 
waves are formed 

when such an undulation is propagated through air 
the wave is composed not as in water of particles which 
are higher than the rest but of particles which are closer 
to each other than the rest the wave is not a ridge of 
elevation but a line of condensation and as in water 
w r e have alternately elevated and depressed lines we have 
in air lines alternately condensed and rarefied and the 
motion of the particles is not as in water up and down 
in a direction transverse to that of the wave which runs 
forwards in the motion of an undulation through air the 
motion of each particle is alternately forwards and back 
wards while the motion of the undulation is constantly 
forwards 

this precise and detailed account of the undulatory 
motion of air by which sound is transmitted was first 
given by newton he further attempted to determine 
the motions of the separate particles and to point out 
the force by which each particle affects the next so as 
to continue the progress of the undulation once begun 
the motions of each particle must be oscillatory he 
assumed the oscillations to be governed by the simplest 
law of oscillation which had come under the notice of 



scientific application of the idea of a medium 

mathematicians that of small vibrations of a pendulum 
and he proved that in this manner the forces which are 
called into play by the contraction and expansion of the 
parts of the elastic fluid are such as the continuance of 
the motion requires 

newtons proof of the exact law of oscillatory motion 
of the aerial particles was not considered satisfactory by 
succeeding mathematicians for it was found that the 
same result the development of forces adequate to con 
tinue the motion would follow if any other law of the 
motion were assumed cramer proved this by a sort of 
parody of newtons proof in which by the alteration of 
a few phrases in this formula of demonstration it was 
made to establish an entirely different conclusion 

but the general conception of an undulation as pre 
sented by newton was as from its manifest mechanical 
truth it could not fail to be accepted by all mathemati 
cians and in proportion as the methods of calculating 
the motions of fluids were further improved the neces 
sary consequences of this conception in the communica 
tion of sound through air were traced by unexceptionable 
reasoning this was especially done by euler and 
lagrange whose memoirs on such motions of fluids are 
some of the most admirable examples which exist of 
refined mathematical methods applied to the solution of 
difficult mechanical problems 

but the great step in the formation of the theory of 
sound was undoubtedly that which we have noticed the 
introduction of the conception of an undulation such as 
we have attempted to describe it a state condition or 
arrangement of the particles of a fluid which is trans 
ferred from one part of space to another by means of 
small motions of the particles altogether distinct from 
the movement of the undulation itself this is a con 
ception which is not obvious to common apprehension 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

it appears paradoxical at first sight to speak of a large 
wave as the tide wave running up a river at the rate of 
twenty miles an hour while the stream of the river is 
all the while flowing downwards yet this is a very 
common fact and the conception of such a motion 
must be fully mastered by all who would reason rightly 
concerning the transmission of impressions through a 
medium 

we have described the motion of sound as produced 
by small motions of the particles forwards and backwards 
while the waves or condensed and rarefied lines move 
constantly forwards it may be asked what right we 
have to suppose the motion to be of this kind since 
when sound is heard no such motions of the particles of 
air can be observed even by refined methods of observa 
tion thus bacon declares himself against the hypothesis 
of such a vibration since as he remarks it cannot be 
perceived in any visible impression upon the flame of a 
candle and to this we reply that the supposition of 
this vibration is made in virtue of a principle which is 
involved in the original assumption of a medium namely 
that a medium in conveying secondary qualities operates by 
means of its primary qualities the bulk figure motion 
and other mechanical properties of its parts this is an 
axiom belonging to the idea of a medium in virtue 
of this axiom it is demonstrable that the motion of the 
air when any how disturbed must be such as is supposed 
in our acoustical reasonings for the elasticity of the 
parts of the air called into play by its expansion and 
contraction lead by a mechanical necessity to such a 
motion as we have described we may add that by 
proper contrivances this motion may be made percep 
tible in its visible effects thus the theory of sound 
as an impression conveyed through air is established 
upon evident general principles although the mathe

rnatical calculations which are requisite to investigate 
its consequences are some of them of a very recondite 
kind 

 light the early attempts to explain vision repre 
sented it as performed by means of material rays pro 
ceeding from the eye by the help of which the eye felt 
out the form and other visible qualities of an object as a 
blind man might do with his staff but this opinion 
could not keep its ground long for it did not even 
explain the fact that light is necessary to vision light 
as a peculiar medium was then assumed as the machinery 
of vision but the mode in which the impression was 
conveyed through the medium was left undetermined 
and no advance was made towards sound theory on that 
subject by the ancients 

in modern times when the prevalent philosophy 
began to assume a mechanical turn as in the theories of 
descartes light was conceived to be a material substance 
which is emitted from luminous bodies and which is also 
conveyed from all bodies to the eye so as to render them 
visible the various changes of direction by which the 
rays of light are affected reflection refraction c 
descartes explained by considering the particles of light 
as small globules which change their direction when 
they impinge upon other bodies according to the laws of 
mechanics newton with a much more profound know 
ledge of mechanics than descartes possessed adopted in 
the most mature of his speculations nearly the same 
view of the nature of light and endeavoured to show 
that reflection refraction and other properties of light 
might be explained as the effects which certain forces 
emanating from the particles of bodies produce upon the 
luminiferous globules 

but though some of the properties of light could thus 
be accounted for by the assumption of particles emitted 
from luminous bodies and reflected or refracted by forces 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

other properties came into view which would not admit 
of the same explanation the phenomena of diffraction 
the fringes which accompany shadows could never be 
truly represented by such an hypothesis in spite of many 
attempts which were made and the colours of thin 
plates which show the rays of light to be affected by an 
alternation of two different conditions at small intervals 
along their length led newton himself to incline often 
and strongly to some hypothesis of undulation the 
double refraction of iceland spar a phenomenon in itself 
very complex could it was found by huyghens be 
expressed with great simplicity by a certain hypothesis of 
undulations 

two hypotheses of the nature of the luminiferous 
medium were thus brought under consideration the one 
representing light as matter emitted from the luminous 
object the other as undulations propagated through a fluid 
these two hypotheses remained in presence of each other 
during the whole of the last century neither of them 
gaining any material advantage over the other though the 
greater part of mathematicians following newton em 
braced the emission theory but at the beginning of the 
present century an additional class of phenomena those 
of the interference of two rays of light were brought 
under consideration by dr young and these phenomena 
were strongly in favour of the undulatory theory while 
they were irreconcilable with the hypothesis of emission 
if it had not been for the original bias of newton and his 
school to the other side there can be little doubt that 
from this period light as well as sound would have been 
supposed to be propagated by undulations although in 
this case it was necessary to assume as the vehicle of 
such undulations a special medium or ether several 
points of the phenomena of vision no doubt remained 
unexplained by the undulatory theory as absorption and 
the natural colours of bodies but such facts though 



scientific application of the idea of a medium 

they did not confirm did not evidently contradict the 
theory of a luminiferous ether and the facts which such 
a theory did explain it explained with singular happiness 
and accuracy 

but before this undulatory theory could be generally 
accepted it was presented in an entirely new point of 
view by being combined with the facts of polarization 
the general idea of polarization must be illustrated here 
after but we may here remark that young and fresnel 
who had adopted the undulatory theory after being 
embarrassed for some time by the new facts which were 
thus presented to their notice at last saw that these 
facts might be explained by conceiving the vibrations to 
be transverse to the ray the motions of the particles 
being not backwards and forwards in the line in which 
the impulse travels but to the right and left of that line 
this conception of transverse vibrations though quite 
unforeseen had nothing in it which was at all difficult to 
reconcile with the general notion of an undulation we 
have described an undulation or wave as a certain 
condition or arrangement of the particles of the fluid 
successively transferred from one part of space to 
another and it is easily conceivable that this arrange 
ment or wave may be produced by a lateral transfer of 
the particles from their quiescent positions this con 
ception of transverse vibrations being accepted it was 
found that the explanation of the phenomena of polariza 
tion and of those of interference led to the same theory 
with a correspondence truly wonderful and this coinci 
dence in the views collected from two quite distinct 
classes of phenomena was justly considered as an almost 
demonstrative evidence of the truth of this undulatory 
theory 

it remained to be considered whether the doctrine of 
transverse vibrations in a fluid could be reconciled with 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

the principles of mechanics and it was found that by 
making certain suppositions in which no inherent impro 
bability existed the hypothesis of transverse vibrations 
would explain the laws both of interference and of 
polarization of light in air and in crystals of all kinds 
with a surprising fertility and fidelity 

thus the undulatory theory of light like the undu 
latory theory of sound is recommended by its conformity 
to the fundamental principle of the secondary mechanical 
sciences that the medium must be supposed to transmit 
its peculiar impulses according to the laws of mechanics 
although no one had previously dreamt of qualities being 
conveyed through a medium by such a process yet when it 
is once suggested as the only mode of explaining some of 
the phenomena there is nothing to prevent our accepting 
it entirely as a satisfactory theory for all the known laws 
of light 

 heat with regard to heat as with regard to 
light a fluid medium was necessarily assumed as the 
vehicle of the property during the last century this 
medium was supposed to be an emitted fluid and 
many of the ascertained laws of heat those which 
prevail with regard to its radiation more especially were 
well explained by this hypothesis other effects of heat 
however as for instance latent lieat and the change of 
consistence of bodies were not satisfactorily brought into 
connexion with the hypothesis while conduction which 
at first did not appear to result from the fundamental 
assumption was to a certain extent explained as internal 
radiation 

but it was by no means clear that an undulatory 
theory of heat might not be made to explain these 
phenomena equally well several philosophers inclined 

 see the account of the theory of exchanges hist ind set ii 
t ii t ib ib 



scientific application of the idea of a medium 

to such a theory and finally ampere showed that the 
doctrine that the heat of a body consists in the undula 
tions of its particles propagated by means of the undula 
tions of a medium might be so adjusted as to explain all 
which the theory of emission could explain and moreover 
to account for facts and laws which were out of the reach 
of that theory about the same time it was discovered 
by prof forbes and m nobili that radiant heat is under 
certain circumstances polarized now polarization had 
been most satisfactorily explained by means of transverse 
undulations in the case of light while all attempts to 
modify the emission theory so as to include polarization 
in it had been found ineffectual hence this discovery 
was justly considered as lending great countenance to the 
opinion that heat consists in the vibrations of its proper 
medium 

but what is this medium is it the same by which 
the impressions of light are conveyed this is a difficult 
question or rather it is one which we cannot at pre 
sent hope to answer with certainty no doubt the 
connexion between light and heat is so intimate and 
constant that we can hardly refrain from considering 
them as affections of the same medium but instead of 
attempting to erect our systems on such loose and 
general views of connexion it is rather the business of 
the philosophers of the present day to determine the laws 
of the operation of heat and its real relation to light in 
order that we may afterwards be able to connect the 
theories of the two qualities perhaps in a more 
advanced state of our knowledge we may be able to state 
it as an axiom that two secondary qualities which are 
intimately connected in their causes and effects must be 
affections of the same medium but at present it does 
not appear safe to proceed upon such a principle although 
many writers in their speculations both concerning light 
vol i x 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

and beat and concerning other properties have not 
hesitated to do so 

some other consequences follow from the idea of a 
medium which must be the subject of another chapter 



chapter iv 
of the measure of secondary qualities 

 scales of qualities in general the ultimate 
object of our investigation in each of the secondary 
mechanical sciences is the nature of the processes by 
which the special impressions of sound light and heat are 
conveyed and the modifications of which these processes 
are susceptible and of this investigation as we have 
seen the necessary basis is the principle that these 
impressions are transmitted by means of a medium 
but before we arrive at this ultimate object we may find 
it necessary to occupy ourselves with several intermediate 
objects before we discover the cause it may be necessary 
to determine the laws of the phenomena even if we 
cannot immediately ascertain the mechanism of light or 
heat it may still be interesting and important to arrange 
and measure the effects which we observe 

the idea of a medium affects our proceeding in this 
research also we cannot measure secondary qualities 
in the same manner in which we measure primary quali 
ties by a mere addition of parts there is this leading 
and remarkable difference that while both classes of 
qualities are susceptible of changes of magnitude primary 
qualities increase by addition of extension secondary by 
augmentation of intensity a space is doubled when 
another equal space is placed by its side one weight 
joined to another makes up the sum of the two but 



measure of secondary qualities 

when one degree of warmth is combined with another or 
one shade of red colour with another we cannot in like 
manner talk of the sum the component parts do not 
evidently retain their separate existence we cannot 
separate a strong green colour into two weaker ones as 
we can separate a large force into two smaller the 
increase is absorbed into the previous amount and is no 
longer in evidence as a part of the whole and this is 
the difference which has given birth to the two words 
extended and intense that is extended which has partes 
extra partes parts outside of parts that is intense which 
becomes stronger by some indirect and unapparent increase 
of agency like the stretching of the internal springs of a 
machine as the term intense implies extended magni 
tudes can at will be resolved into the parts of which they 
were originally composed or any other which the nature 
of their extension admits their proportion is apparent 
they are directly and at once subject to the relations of 
number intensive magnitudes cannot be resolved into 
smaller magnitudes we can see that they differ but we 
cannot tell in what proportion we have no direct 
measure of their quantity how many times hotter than 
blood is boiling water the answer cannot be given 
by the aid of our feelings of heat alone 

this difference as we have said is connected with 
the fundamental principle that we do not perceive 
secondary qualities directly but through a medium we 
have no natural apprehension of light or sound or heat 
as they exist in the bodies from which they proceed but 
only as they affect our organs we can only measure 
them therefore by some scale supplied by their effects 
and thus while extended magnitudes as space time are 
measurable directly and of themselves intensive magni 
tudes as brightness loudness heat are measurable only 
by artificial means and conventional scales space time

measure themselves the repetition of a smaller space or 
time while it composes a larger one measures it but 
for light and heat we must have photometers and ther 
mometers which measure something which is assumed to 
be an indication of the quality in question in one case 
the mode of applying the measure and the meaning of 
the number resulting are seen by intuition in the 
other they are consequences of assumption and reason 
ing in the one case they are units of which the exten 
sion is made up in the other they are degrees by which 
the intensity ascends 

 when we discover any property in a sensible qua 
lity which at once refers us to number or space we readily 
take this property as a measure and thus we make a 
transition from quality to quantity thus ptolemy in the 
third chapter of the first book of his harmonics begins 
thus as to the differences which exist in sounds both 
in quality and in quantity if we consider that difference 
which refers to the acuteness and graveness we cannot 
at once tell to which of the above two classes it belongs 
till we have considered the causes of such symptoms 
but at the end of the chapter having satisfied himself 
that grave sounds result from the magnitude of the string 
or pipe other things being equal he infers thus the 
difference of acute and grave appears to be a difference of 
quantity 

in the same manner in order to form secondary 
mechanical sciences respecting any of the other pro 
perties of bodies we must reduce these properties to a 
dependence upon quantity and thus make them subject 
to measurement we cannot obtain any sciential truths 
respecting the comparison of sensible qualities till we 
have discovered measures and scales of the qualities 
which we have to consider and accordingly some of the 
most important steps in such sciences have been the 



measure of secondary qualities 

establishment of such measures and scales and the inven 
tion of the requisite instruments 

the formation of the mathematical sciences which 
rest upon the measures of the intensity of sensible 
qualities took place mainly in the course of the last 
century perhaps we may consider lambert a mathe 
matician who resided in switzerland and published about 
 as the person who first clearly felt the importance 
of establishing such sciences his photometry pyro 
metry hygrometry are examples of the systematic 
reduction of sensible qualities light heat moisture to 
modes of numerical measurement 

we now proceed to speak of such modes of measure 
ment with regard to the most obvious properties of 
bodies 

 i the musical scale the establishment of 
the harmonic canon that is of a scale and measure of 
the musical place of notes in the relation of high and low 
was the first step in the science of harmonics the 
perception of the differences and relations of musical 
sounds is the office of the sense of hearing but these 
relations are fixed and rendered accurately recognisable 
by artificial means indeed in all the senses as 
ptolemy truly says in the opening of his harmonics the 
sense discovers what is approximately true and receives 
accuracy from another quarter the reason receives the 
approximatelytrue from another quarter and discovers 
the accurate truth we can have no measures of 
sensible qualities which do not ultimately refer to the 
sense whether they do this immediately as when we 
refer colours to an assumed standard or mediately as 
when we measure heat by expansion having previously 
found by an appeal to sense that the expansion 
increases with the heat such relations of sensible 
qualities cannot be described in words and can only be 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

apprehended by their appropriate faculty the faculty 
by which the relations of sounds are apprehended is a 
musical car in the largest acceptation of the term in this 
signification the faculty is nearly universal among men 
for all persons have musical ears sufficiently delicate to 
understand and to imitate the modulations corresponding 
to various emotions in speaking which modulations 
depend upon the succession of acuter and graver tones 
these are the relations now spoken of and these are 
plainly perceived by persons who have very imperfect 
musical ears according to the common use of the phrase 
but the relations of tones which occur in speaking are 
somewhat indefinite and in forming that musical scale 
which is the basis of our science upon the subject we 
take the most definite and marked of such relations of 
notes such as occur not in speaking but in singing 
those musical relations of two sounds which we call the 
octave the fifth the fourth the third are recognised after 
a short familiarity with them these chords or intervals 
are perceived to have each a peculiar character which 
separates them from the relations of two sounds taken at 
random and makes it easy to know them when sung or 
played on an instrument and for most persons not diffi 
cult to sing the sounds in succession exactly or nearly 
correct these musical relations or concords then are 
the groundwork of our musical standard but how are 
we to name these indescribable sensible characters 
how to refer with unerring accuracy to a type which 
exists only in our own perceptions we must have for 
this purpose a scale and a standard 

the musical scale is a series of eight notes ascend 
ing by certain steps from the first or keynote to the 
octave above it each of the notes being fixed by such 
distinguishable musical relations as we have spoken of 
above we may call these notes c d e f a a b c 



measure of secondary qualities 

and we may then say that g is determined by its being a 
fifth above c d by its being a fourth below g e by its 
being a third above c and similarly of the rest it will 
be recollected that the terms fifth a fourth a third have 
hitherto been introduced as expressing certain simple and 
indescribable musical relations among sounds which 
might have been indicated by any other names thus 
we might call the fifth the dominant and the fourth the 
subdominant as is done in one part of musical science 
but the names we have used which are the common 
ones are in fact derived from the number of notes which 
these intervals include in the scale obtained in the above 
manner the notes c d e f g being five the interval 
from c to g is a fifth and so of the rest the fixation of 
this scale gave the means of describing exactly any note 
which occurs in the scale and the method is easily appli 
cable to notes above and below this range for in a 
series of sounds higher or lower by an octave than this 
standard series the ear discovers a recurrence of the 
same relations so exact that a person may sometimes 
imagine he is producing the same notes as another when 
he is singing the same air an octave higher hence the 
next eight notes may be conveniently denoted by a repeti 
tion of the same letters as the first thus c r e f g a b 
c d ef y a b and it is easy to devise a continuation 
of such cycles and other admissible notes are desig 
nated by a further modification of the standard ones as 
by making each note flat or sharp which modification it 
is not necessary here to consider since our object is only 
to show how a standard is attainable and how it serves 
the ends of science 

we may observe however that the above is not an 
exact account of the first or early greek scale for this 
scale was founded on a primary division of the interval of 
two octaves the extreme range which it admitted into 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

five tetrachords each tetrachord including the interval of 
a fourth all the notes of this series had different 
names borrowed from this division r thus mese was the 
middle or keynote the note below it was lichanos meson 
the next below was parypate meson the next lower 
jupate meson the fifth above mese was nete diazeuy 
menon the octave was nete hyperlolceon 

 but supposing a complete system of such denomi 
nations established how could it be with certainty and 
rigour applied the human ear is fallible the organs of 
voice imperfectly obedient if this were not so there 
would be no such thing as a cjood ear or a good voice 
what means can be devised of finding at will a perfect 
concord a fifth or a fourth or supposing such concords 
fixed by an acknowledged authority how can they be 
referred to and the authority adduced how can we 
enact a standard of sounds 

a standard was discovered in the monochord a 
musical string properly stretched may be made to pro 
duce different notes in proportion as we intercept a 
longer or shorter portion and make this portion vibrate 
the relation of the length of the strings which thus 
sound the two notes a and c is fixed and constant and 
the same is true of all other notes hence the musical 
interval of any notes of which we know the places in the 
musical scale may be reproduced by measuring the 
lengths of string which are known to give them if c be 
of the length d is e is f is g is 
and thus the musical relations are reduced to numerical 
relations and the monochord is a complete and perfect 
tonometer 

we have here taken the length of the string as the mea 
sure of the tone but we may observe that there is in us a 
necessary tendency to assume that the ground of this mea 

 burneys history of music vol i p 



measure of secondary qualities 

sure is to be sought in some ulterior cause and when we 
consider the matter further we find this cause in the fre 
quency of these vibrations of the string the truth that 
the same note must result from the same frequency of 
vibration is readily assented to on a slight suggestion of 
experience thus mersenne when he undertakes to 
determine the frequency of vibrations of a given sound 
says supponendum est quoscunque nervos et quaslibet 
chordas unisonum facientes eundem efficere numerum 
recursuum eodem vel equali tempore quod perpetua 
constat experientia and he proceeds to apply it to 
cases where experience could not verify this assertion or 
at least had not verified it as to that of pipes 

the pursuit of these numerical relations of tones 
forms the science of harmonics of which here we do 
not pretend to give an account but only to show how 
the invention of a scale and nomenclature a standard 
and measure of the tone of sounds is its necessary basis 
we will therefore now r proceed to speak of another 
subject colour 

 ii scales of colour the prismatic scale of 
colour a scale of colour must depend originally upon 
differences discernible by the eye as a scale of notes 
depends on differences perceived by the ear in one 
respect the difficulty is greater in the case of the visible 
qualities for there are no relations of colour which the 
eye peculiarly singles out and distinguishes as the ear 
selects and distinguishes an octave or a fifth hence we 
are compelled to take an arbitrary scale and we have 
to find one which is fixed and which includes a proper 
collection of colours the prismatic spectrum or coloured 
image produced when a small beam of light passes 
obliquely through any transparent surface as the surface 
of a prism of glass offers an obvious standard as far 

 harmoma lib ii prop 




 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 



as it is applicable accordingly colours have for various 
purposes been designated by their place in the spectrum 
ever since the time of newton and we have thus a 
means of referring to such colours as are included in the 
series red orange yellow green blue violet indigo and the 
intermediate tints 

but this scale is not capable of numerical precision 
if the spectrum could be exactly defined as to its 
extremities and if these colours occupied always the 
same proportional part of it we might describe any 
colour in the above series by the measure of its position 
but the fact is otherwise the spectrum is too indefinite 
in its boundaries to afford any distinct point from which 
we may commence our measures and moreover the 
spectra produced by different transparent bodies differ 
from each other newton had supposed that the spec 
trum and its parts were the same so long as the refrac 
tion was the same but his successors discovered that 
with the same amount of refraction in different kinds of 
glass there are different magnitudes of the spectrum 
and what is still worse with reference to our present 
purpose that the spectra from different glasses have 
the colours distributed in different proportions in order 
therefore to make the spectrum the scale of colour we 
must assume some fixed substance for instance we may 
take water and thus the colours of the rainbow will 
be our standard but we should still have an extreme 
difficulty in applying such a rule the distinctions of 
colour which the terms of common language express are 
not used with perfect unanimity or with rigorous precision 
what one person calls bluish green another calls greenish 
blue nobody can say what is the precise boundary 
between red and orange thus the prismatic scale of 
colour was incapable of mathematical exactness and this 
inconvenience was felt up to our own times 



measure of secondary qualities 

but this difficulty was removed by a curious dis 
covery of fraunhofer who found that there are in the 
solar spectrum certain line black lines which occupy a 
definite place in the series of colours and can be ob 
served with perfect precision we have now no uncer 
tainty as to what coloured light we are speaking of when 
we describe it as that part of the spectrum in which 
fraunhofers line c or d occurs and thus by this dis 
covery the prismatic spectrum of sunlight became for 
certain purposes an exact chromatometer 

 newtons scale of colours still such a standard 
is arbitrary and seemingly anomalous the lines a b c d 
c of fraunhofers spectrum are distributed without 
any apparent order or law and we do not in this way 
obtain numerical measures which is what in all cases we 
desire to have another discovery of newton however 
gives us a spectrum containing the same colours as the 
prismatic spectrum but produced in another way so that 
the colours have a numerical relation i speak of the 
colours of thin plates the little rainbows which we some 
times see in the cracks of broken glass are governed by 
fixed and simple laws the kind of colour produced at 
any point depends on the thickness of the thin plate of 
air included in the fissure if the thickness be twelve 
millionths of an inch the colour is orange if tenmil 
lionths of an inch we have green and so on and thus 
these numbers which succeed each other in a regular 
order from red to indigo give a numerical measure of 
each colour which measure when we pursue the subject 
we find is one of the bases of all optical theory the 
series of colours obtained from plates of air of gradually 
increasing thickness is called newtons scale of colours 
but we may observe that this is not precisely what we are 
here speaking of a scale of simple colours it is a series 
produced by certain combinations resulting from the 



 philosophy op secondary mechanical sciences 

repetition of the first spectrum and is mainly useful as a 
standard for similar phenomena and not for colour in 
general the real scale of colour is to be found as we 
have said in the numbers which express the thickness of 
the producing film in the length of a fit in newtons 
phraseology or the length of an undulation in the modern 
theory 

 scales of impure colours the standards just spoken 
of include mainly at least only pure and simple colours 
and however complete they may be for certain objects of 
the science of op tics they are insufficient for other purposes 
they do not enable us to put in their place mixed and im 
pure colours and there is in the case of colour a diffi 
culty already noticed which does not occur in the case of 
sound two notes when sounded together are not neces 
sarily heard as one they are recognised as still two and 
as forming a concord or a discord but two colours form 
a single colour and the eye cannot in any way distin 
guish between a green compounded of blue and yellow 
and the simple undecomposable green of the spectrum 
by composition of three or more colours innumerable 
new colours may be generated which form no part of the 
prismatic series and by such compositions is woven the 
infinitely varied web of colour which forms the clothing 
of nature how are we to classify and arrange all the 
possible colours of objects so that each shall have a place 
and name how shall we find a chromatometer for 
impure as well as for pure colour 

though no optical investigations have depended on a 
scale of impure colours such a scale has been wanted and 
invented for other purposes for instance in order to 
identify and describe objects of natural history not to 
speak of earlier essays we may notice werners nomen 
clature of colours devised for the purpose of describing 
minerals this scale of colour was far superior to any 



measure of secondary qualities 

which had previously been promulgated it was indeed 
arbitrary in the selection of its degrees and in a great 
measure in their arrangement and the colours were 
described by the usual terms though generally with some 
added distinction as blackish green bluish green apple 
green emerald green but the great merit of the scale 
was its giving a fixed conventional meaning to these terms 
so that they lost much of their usual vagueness thus 
applegreen did not mean the colour of any green apple 
casually taken but a certain definite colour which the 
student was to bear in mind whether or not he had ever 
seen an apple of that exact hue the words were not a 
description but a record of the colour the memory was 
to retain a sensation not a name 

the imperfection of the system arising from its arbi 
trary form was its incompleteness however well it 
served for the reference of the colours which it did con 
tain it was applicable to no others and thus though 
werners enumeration extended to more than a hundred 
colours there occur in nature a still greater number 
which cannot be exactly described by means of it 

in such cases the unclassed colour is by the werne 
rians defined by stating it as intermediate between two 
others thus we have an object described as between eme 
rald green and grass green the eye is capable of per 
ceiving a gradation from one colour to another such as 
may be produced by a gradual mixture in various ways 
and if we image to ourselves such a mixture we can 
compare with it a given colour but in employing this 
method we have nothing to tell us in what part of the 
scale we must seek for an approximation to our unclassed 
colour we have no rule for discovering where we are 
to look for the boundaries of the definition of a colour 
which the wernerian series does not supply for it is 
not always between contiguous members of the series 
that the undescribed colour is found if we place erne 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

raid green between apple green and grass green we may 
yet have a colour intermediate between emerald green 
and leek green and in fact the wernerian series of 
colours is destitute of a principle of selfarrangement and 
gradation and is thus necessarily and incurably imperfect 

 we should have a complete scale of colours if we 
could form a series including all colours and arranged so 
that each colour was intermediate in its tint between the 
adjacent terms of the series for then whether we took 
many or few of the steps of the series for our standard 
terms the rest could be supplied by the law of continuity 
and any given colour would either correspond to one of 
the steps of our scale or fall between two intermediate 
ones the invention of a chromatometer for impure 
colours therefore requires that we should be able to form 
all possible colours by such intermediation in a systematic 
manner that is by the mixture or combination of cer 
tain elementary colours according to a simple rule and 
we are led to ask whether such a process has been shown 
to be possible 

the colours of the prismatic spectrum obviously do 
form a continuous series green is intermediate between 
its neighbours yellow and blue orange between red and 
yellow and if we suppose the two ends of the spectrum 
bent round to meet each other so that the arrangement 
of the colours may be circular the violet and indigo will 
find their appropriate place between the blue and red 
and all the interjacent tints of the spectrum as well as 
the ones thus named will result from such an arrange 
ment thus all the pure colours are produced by com 
binations two and two of three primary colours red 
yellow and blue and the question suggests itself 
whether these three are not really the only primary 
colours and whether all the impure colours do not arise 
from mixtures of the three in various proportions there 
are various modes in which this suggestion may be 



measure of secondary qualities o 

applied to the construction of a scale of colours but the 
simplest and the one which appears really to verify the con 
jecture that all possible colours may be so exhibited is the 
following a certain combination of red yellow and blue 
will produce black or pure grey and when diluted will 
give all the shades of grey which intervene between black 
and white by adding various shades of grey then to pure 
colours we may obtain all the possible ternary combina 
tions of red yellow and blue and in this way it is found 
that we exhaust the range of colours thus the circle of 
pure colours of which we have spoken may be accompa 
nied by several other circles in which these colours are 
tinged with a less or greater shade of grey and in this 
manner it is found that we have a perfect chromatometer 
every possible colour being exhibited either exactly or by 
means of approximate and contiguous limits the ar 
rangement of colours has been brought into this final and 
complete form by m merimee whose chromatic scale is 
published by m mirbel in his elements of botany we may 
observe that such a standard affords us a numerical expo 
nent for every colour by means of the proportions of the 
three primary colours which compose it or expressing 
the same result otherwise by means of the pure colour 
which is involved and the proportion of grey by which 
it is rendered impure in such a scale the fundamental 
elements would be the precise tints of red yellow and 
blue which are found or assumed to be primary the 
numerical exponents of each colour would depend upon 
the arbitrary number of degrees which we interpose be 
tween each two primary colours and between each pure 
colour and absolute blackness no such numerical 
scale has however as yet obtained general acceptation 

 iii scales of light photometer another instru 
ment much needed in optical researches is a photometer a 
measure of the intensity of light in this case also 
the organ of sense the eye is the ultimate judge no r 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

has any effect of light as light yet been discovered which 
we can substitute for such a judgment all instruments 
such as that of leslie which employ the heating effect of 
light or at least all that have hitherto been proposed are in 
admissible as photometers but though the eye can judge 
of two surfaces illuminated by light of the same colour 
and can determine when they are equally bright or which 
is the brighter the eye can by no means decide at sight 
the proportion of illumination how much in such 
judgments we are affected by contrast is easily seen when 
we consider how different is the apparent brightness of 
the moon at midday and at midnight though the light 
which we receive from her is in fact the same at both 
periods in order to apply a scale in this case we must 
take advantage of the known numerical relations of light 
we are certain that if all other illumination be excluded 
two equal luminaries under the same circumstances will 
produce an illumination twice as great as one does and 
we can easily prove from mathematical considerations 
that if light be not enfeebled by the medium through 
which it passes the illumination on a given surface 
will diminish as the square of the distance of the lumi 
nary increases if therefore we can by taking a frac 
tion thus known of the illuminating effect of one lumi 
nary make it equal to the total effect of another of which 
equality the eye is a competent judge we compare the 
effects of the two luminaries in order to make this 
comparison we may with rumford look at the shadows 
of the same object made by the two lights or with 
ritchie we may view the brightness produced on two 
contiguous surfaces framing an apparatus so that the 
equality may be brought about by proper adjustment and 
thus a measure will become practicable or we may em 
ploy other methods as was done by wollaston who 
reduced the light of the sun by observing it as reflected 
 phil trans p 



measure of secondary qualities o 

from a bright globule and thus found the light of the 
sun to be times that of sirius the 
brightest fixed star all these methods are inaccurate 
even as methods of comparison and do not offer any 
fixed or convenient numerical standard but none better 
have yet been devised 

 cyanometer as we thus measure the brightness 
of a colourless light we may measure the intensity of any 
particular colour in the same way that is by applying 
a standard exhibiting the gradations of the colour in 
question till we find a shade which is seen to agree with 
the proposed object such an instrument we have in the 
cyanometer which was invented by saussure for the 
purpose of measuring the intensity of the blue colour of 
the sky we may introduce into such an instrument a 
numerical scale but the numbers in such a scale will be 
altogether arbitrary 

 iv scales of heat when we proceed to the 
sensation of heat and seek a measure of that quality we 
find at first sight new difficulties our sensations of this 
kind are more fluctuating than those of vision for we 
know that the same object may feel warm to one hand 
and cold to another at the same instant if the hands 
have been previously cooled and warmed respectively 
nor can we obtain here as in the case of light selfevi 
dent numerical relations of the heat communicated in 
given circumstances for we know that the effect so pro 
duced will depend on the warmth of the body to be 
heated as well as on that of the source of heat the 
summer sun which warms our bodies will not augment 
the heat of a redhot iron the cause of the diffe 
rence of these cases is that bodies do not receive the 
whole of their heat as they receive the whole of their 
light from the immediate influence of obvious external 
agents there is no readilydiscovered absolute cold 

vol i y 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

corresponding to the absolute darkness which we can easily 
produce or imagine hence we should be greatly at a 
loss to devise a thermometer if we did not find an indirect 
effect of heat sufficiently constant and measurable to 
answer this purpose we discover however such an 
effect in the expansion of bodies by the effect of heat 

 many obvious phenomena show that air under 
given circumstances expands by the effect of heat the 
same is seen to be true of liquids as of water and spirit 
of wine and the property is found to belong also to the 
metallic fluid quicksilver a more careful examination 
showed that the increase of bulk in some of these bodies 
by increase of heat was a fact of a nature sufficiently con 
stant and regular to afford a means of measuring that 
previously intangible quality and the thermometer was 
invented there were however many difficulties to 
overcome and many points to settle before this instru 
ment was fit for the purposes of science 

an explanation of the way in which this was done 
necessarily includes an important chapter of the history 
of thermotics we must now therefore briefly notice 
historically the progress of the thermometer the lead 
ing steps of this progress after the first invention of the 
instrument were the establishment of fixed points in 
the thermometric scale the comparison of the scales of 
different substances and the reconcilement of these 
differences by some method of interpreting them as indi 
cations of the absolute quantity of heat 

 it would occupy too much space to give in detail 
the history of the successive attempts by which these steps 
were effected a thermometer is described by bacon 
under the title vitrum calendare this was an air ther 
mometer newton used a thermometer of linseed oil 
and he perceived that the first step requisite to give 
value to such an instrument was to fix its scale accord 



measure of secondary qualities 

ingly he proposed his scala graduum caloris but 
when thermometers of different liquids were compared 
it appeared from their discrepancies that this fixation of 
the scale of heat was more difficult than had been sup 
posed it was however effected newton had taken 
freezing water or rather thawing snow as the zero of his 
scale which is really a fixed point halley and amontons 
discovered in and that the heat of boiling 
water is another fixed point and daniel gabriel fahren 
heit of dantzig by carefully applying these two standard 
points produced about thermometers which were 
constantly consistent with each other this result was 
much admired at the time and was in fact the solution 
of the problem just stated the fixation of the scale of heat 

 but the scale thus obtained is a conventional not 
a natural scale it depends upon the fluid employed for 
the thermometer the progress of expansion from the 
heat of freezing to that of boiling water is different for 
mercury oil water spirit of wine air a degree of heat 
which is halfway between these two standard points 
according to a mercurial thermometer will be below the 
halfway point in a spirit thermometer and above it in 
an air thermometer each liquid has its own march in 
the course of its expansion deluc and others compared 
the marches of various liquids and thus made what we 
may call a concordance of thermometers of various kinds 

 here the question farther occurs is there not 
some natural measure of the degrees of heat it appears 
certain that there must be such a measure and that by 
means of it all the scales of different liquids must be 
reconciled yet this does not seem to have occurred at 
once to mens minds deluc in speaking of the re 
searches which we have just mentioned saysf when i 
undertook these experiments it never once came into my 

 phil trans t modif de hatmosph p 

y 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

thoughts that they could conduct me with any probability 
to a table of real degrees of heat but hope grows with 
success and desire with hope accordingly he pursued 
this inquiry for a long course of years 

what are the principles by which we are to be 
guided to the true measure of heat here as in all the 
sciences of this class we have the general principle that 
the secondary quality heat must be supposed to be per 
ceived in some way by a material medium or fluid if 
we take that which is perhaps the simplest form of this 
hypothesis that the heat depends upon the quantity of this 
fluid or caloric which is present we shall find that we are 
led to propositions which may serve as a foundation for a 
natural measure of heat the method of mixtures is 
one example of such a result if we mix together two 
pints of water one hot and one cold is it not manifest 
that the temperature of the mixture must be midway 
between the two each of the two portions brings with it 
its own heat the whole heat or caloric of the mixture 
is the sum of the two and the heat of each half must be 
the half of this sum and therefore its temperature must 
be intermediate between the temperatures of the equal 
portions which were mixed deluc made experiments 
founded upon this principle and was led by them to con 
clude that the dilatations of mercury follow an accele 
rated march for successive equal augmentations of heat 

but there are various circumstances which prevent 
this method of mixtures from being so satisfactory as at 
first sight it seems to promise to be the different capa 
cities for heat of different substances and even of the 
same substance at different temperatures introduce much 
difficulty into the experiments and this path of inquiry 
has not yet led to a satisfactory result 

 another mode of inquiring into the natural measure 
of heat is to seek it by researches on the law of cooling of 



measure of secondary qualities 

hot bodies if we assume that the process of cooling of 
hot bodies consists in a certain material heat flying off 
we may by means of certain probable hypotheses deter 
mine mathematically the law according to which the tem 
perature decreases as time goes on and we may assume 
that to be the true measure of temperature which gives 
to the experimental law of cooling the most simple and 
probable form 

it appears evident from the most obvious conceptions 
which we can form of the manner in which a body parts 
with its superabundant heat that the hotter a body is the 
faster it cools though it is not clear without experi 
ment by what law the rate of cooling will depend upon 
the heat of the body newton took for granted the most 
simple and seemingly natural law of this dependence he 
supposed the rate of cooling to be proportional to the 
temperature and from this supposition he could deduce 
the temperature of a hot iron calculating from the original 
temperature and the time during which it had been cool 
ing by calculation founded on such a basis he graduated 
his thermometer 

 but a little further consideration showed that the 
rate of cooling of hot bodies depended upon the tempera 
ture of the surrounding bodies as well as upon its own 
temperature prevosts theory of exchanges was pro 
pounded with a view of explaining this dependence and 
was generally accepted according to this theory all 
bodies radiate heat to one another and are thus con 
stantly giving and receiving heat and a body which i s 
hotter than surrounding bodies cools itself and warms 
the surrounding bodies by an exchange of heat for heat 
in which they are the gainers hence if be the tem 
perature of the bodies or of the space by which the hot 
body is surrounded and t the temperature of the hot 

 recherche sur la chaleur hist ind ii 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

body the rate of cooling will depend upon the excess of 
the radiation for a temperature t above the radiation 
for a temperature 

accordingly in the admirable researches of mm 
dulong and petit upon the cooling of bodies it was 
assumed that the rate of cooling of the hot body was 
represented by the excess of fm above f where 
f represented some mathematical function that is some 
expression obtained by arithmetical operations from the 
temperatures and although what these operations 
are to be was left undecided and was in fact determined 
by the experiments and the result of their investiga 
tions was that the function is of this kind when the 
temperature increases by equal intervals the function 
increases in a continued geometric proportion this 
was in fact the same law which had been assumed by 
newton and others with this difference that they had 
neglected the term which depends upon the temperature 
of the surrounding space 

 this law falls in so well with the best conceptions 
we can form of the mechanism of cooling upon the suppo 
sition of a radiant fluid caloric that it gives great proba 
bility to the scale of temperature on which the simplicity 
of the result depends now the temperatures in the 
formulae just referred to were expressed by means of the 
air thermometer hence mm dulong and petit justly 
state that while all different substances employed as ther 
mometers give different laws of thermotical phenomena 
their own success in obtaining simple and general laws 
by means of the air thermometer is a strong recommen 
dation of that as the natural scale of heat they add f

 the wellknown uniformity of the principal physical 
properties of all gases and especially the perfect identity 
of their laws of dilatation by heat a very important 
discovery of dalton and gay lussac make it very 
probable that in this class of bodies the disturbing causes 
have not the same influence as in solids and liquids and 
consequently that the changes of bulk produced by the 
action of heat are here in a more immediate dependence 
on the force which produces them 

 still we cannot consider this point as settled 
till we obtain a more complete theoretical insight into 
the nature of heat itself if it be true that heat con 
sists in the vibrations of a fluid then although as 
ampere has shown f the laws of radiation will on 
mathematical grounds be the same as they are on the 
hypothesis of emission we cannot consider the natural 
scale of heat as determined till we have discovered 
some means of measuring the caloriferous vibrations 
as we measure luminiferous vibrations we shall only 
know what the quantity of heat is when we know what 
heat itself is when we have obtained a theory which 
satisfactorily explains the manner in which the sub 
stance or medium of heat produces its effects when 
we see how radiation and conduction dilatation and 
liquefaction are all produced by mechanical changes of 
the same fluid we shall then see what the nature of that 
change is which dilatation really measures and what 
relation it bears to any more proper standard of heat 

we may add that while our thermotical theory is 
still so imperfect as it is all attempts to divine the true 
nature of the relation between light and heat are pre 
mature and must be in the highest degree insecure and 
visionary speculations in which from the general 
assumption of a caloriferous and luminiferous medium 

 ffist ind ii f ii 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

and from a few facts arbitrarily selected and loosely 
analysed a general theory of light and heat is asserted 
are entirely foreign to the course of inductive science 
and cannot lead to any stable and substantial truth 

 other instruments for measuring heat it does not 
belong to our present purpose to speak of instruments of 
which the object is to measure not sensible qualities but 
some effect or modification of the cause by which such 
qualities are produced such for instance are the calo 
rimeter employed by lavoisier and laplace in order to 
compare the specific heat of different substances and 
the actinometer invented by sir john herschel in order 
to determine the effect of the suns rays by means of the 
heat which they communicate in a given time which 
effect is as may readily be supposed very different under 
different circumstances of atmosphere and position the 
laws of such effects may be valuable contributions to our 
knowledge of heat but the interpretation of them must 
depend on a previous knowledge of the relations which 
temperature bears to heat according to the views just 
explained 

 v scales of other qualities before quitting 
the subject of the measures of sensible qualities we may 
observe that there are several other such qualities for 
which it would be necessary to have scales and means of 
measuring in order to make any approach to science on 
such subjects this is true for instance of tastes and 
smells indeed some attempts have been made towards 
a classification of the tastes of sapid substances but these 
have not yet assumed any satisfactory or systematic 
character and i am not aware that any instruments 
have been suggested for measuring either the flavour or 
the odour of bodies which possess such qualities 

 quality of sounds the same is true of that kind 
of difference in sounds which is peculiarly termed their 



measure of secondary qualities 

quality that character by which for instance the sound 
of a flute differs from that of a hautbois when the note 
is the same or a womans voice from a boys 

 articulate sounds there is also in sounds another 
difference of which the nature is still obscure but in 
reducing which to rule and consequently to measure 
some progress has nevertheless been made i speak of 
the differences of sound considered as articulate classi 
fications of the sounds of the usual alphabets have been 
frequently proposed for instance that which arranges 
the consonants into the following groups 

sharp flat sharp aspirate flat aspirate nasal 

p b ph bh v m 

k g hard kh gh ng 

t d th sharp th flat n 

s z sh zh 

it is easily perceived that the relations of the sounds in 
each of these horizontal lines are analogous and accord 
ingly the rules of derivation and modification of words 
in several languages proceed upon such analogies in 
the same manner the vowels may be arranged in an order 
depending on their sound but to make such arrange 
ments fixed and indisputable we ought to know the 
mechanism by which such modifications are caused 
instruments have been invented by which some of these 
sounds can be imitated and if such instruments could 
be made to produce the above series of articulate sounds 
by connected and regular processes we should find in the 
process a measure of the sound produced this has been 
in a great degree effected for the vowels by professor 
williss artificial mode of imitating them for he finds 
that if a musical reed be made to sound through a cylin 
drical pipe we obtain by gradually lengthening the cylin 
drical pipe the series of vowels i e a o u with 
intermediate sounds in this instrument then the 
 camb trans vol iii p 



 philosophy of secondary mechanical sciences 

length of the pipe would determine the vowel and 
might be used numerically to express it such an 
instrument so employed would be a measure of vowel 
quality 

our business at present however is not with instru 
ments which might be devised for measuring sensible 
qualities but with those which have been so used and 
have thus been the basis of the sciences in which such 
qualities are treated of and this we have now done suf 
ficiently for our present purpose 

 there is another idea which though hitherto very 
vaguely entertained has had considerable influence in the 
formation both of the sciences spoken of in the present 
book and on others which will hereafter come under our 
notice namely the idea of polarity this idea will be 
the subject of the ensuing book and although this 
idea forms a part of the basis of various other extensive 
portions of science as optics and chemistry it occupies 
so peculiarly conspicuous a place in speculations belong 
ing to what i have termed the mechanicochemical 
sciences magnetism and electricity that i shall desig 
nate the discussion of the idea of polarity as the philo 
sophy of those sciences

attempts at the scientific application 
of the idea of polarity 

 in some of the mechanical sciences as magnetism 
and optics the phenomena are found to depend upon posi 
tion the position of the magnet or of the ray of light 
in a peculiar alternate manner this dependence as it 
was first apprehended was represented by means of 
certain conceptions of space and force as for instance by 
considering the two poles of a magnet but in all such 
modes of representing these alternations by the concep 
tions borrowed from other ideas a closer examination 
detected something superfluous and something defective 
and in proportion as the view which philosophers took of 
this relation was gradually purified from these incongru 
ous elements and was rendered more general and abstract 
by the discovery of analogous properties in new cases it 
was perceived that the relation could not be adequately 
apprehended without considering it as involving a 
peculiar and independent idea which we may designate 
by the term polarity 

we shall trace some of the forms in which this idea 
has manifested itself in the history of science in doing 
so we shall not begin as in other books of this work 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

we have done by speaking of the notion as it is employed 
in common use for the relation of polarity is of so 
abstract and technical a nature that it is not employed 
at least in any distinct and obvious manner on any 
ordinary or practical occasions the idea belongs pecu 
liarly to the region of speculation in persons of com 
mon habits of thought it is probably almost or quite 
undeveloped and even most of those whose minds have 
been long occupied by science find a difficulty in appre 
hending it in its full generality and abstraction and stript 
of all irrelevant hypothesis 

 magnetism the name and the notion of poles 
were first adopted in the case of a magnet if we have 
two magnets their extremities attract and repel each 
other alternatively if the first end of the one attract 
the first end of the other it repels the second end and 
conversely in order to express this rule conveniently 
the two ends of each magnet are called the north pole and 
the south pole respectively the denominations being bor 
rowed from the poles of the earth and heavens these 
poles as gilbert says regulate the motions of the 
celestial spheres and of the earth in like manner the 
magnet has its poles a northern and a southern one 
certain and determined points constituted by nature in 
the stone the primary terms of its motions and effects 
the limits and governors of many actions and virtues 

the nature of the opposition of properties of which 
we speak may be stated thus 

the north pole of one magnet attracts the south 
pole of another magnet 

the north pole of one magnet repels the north pole 
of another magnet 

the south pole of one magnet repels the south pole 
of another magnet 

 de magn lib i c 



application of the idea of polarity 

the south pole of one magnet attracts the north 
pole of another magnet 

it will be observed that the contrariety of position 
which is indicated by putting the south pole for the north 
pole in either magnet is accompanied by the opposition 
of mechanical effect which is expressed by changing 
attraction into repulsion and repulsion into attraction 
and thus we have the general feature of polarity a 
contrast of properties corresponding to a contrast of 
positions 

 electricity when the phenomena of electricity 
came to be studied it appeared that they involved rela 
tions in some respects analogous to those of magnetism 

two kinds of electricity were distinguished the 
positive and the negative arid it appeared that two 
bodies electrized positively or two electrized negatively 
repelled each other like two north or two south magnetic 
poles while a positively and a negatively electrized body 
attracted each other like the north and south poles of 
two magnets in conductors of an oblong form the 
electricity could easily be made to distribute itself so 
that one end should be positively and one end negatively 
electrized and then such conductors acted on each other 
exactly as magnets would do 

but in conductors however electrized there is no 
peculiar point which can permanently be considered as 
the pole the distribution of electricity in the conduc 
tor depends upon external circumstances and thus 
although the phenomena offer the general character of 
polarity alternative results corresponding to alternative 
positions they cannot be referred to poles some other 
mode of representing the forces must be adopted than 
that which makes them emanate from permanent points 
as in a magnet 

the phenomena of attraction and repulsion in elec 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

trized bodies were conveniently represented by means of 
the hypothesis of two electric fluids a positive and a 
negative one which were supposed to be distributed in 
the bodies of these fluids it was supposed that each 
repelled its own parts and attracted those of the opposite 
fluid and it was found that this hypothesis explained all 
the obvious laws of electric action here then we have 
the phenomena of polarization explained by a new kind 
of machinery two opposite fluids distributed in bodies 
and supplying them so to speak with their polar forces 
this hypothesis not only explains electrical attraction 
but also the electrical spark when two bodies of which 
the neighbouring surfaces are charged with the two 
opposite fluids approach near to each other the mutual 
attraction of the fluids becomes more and more intense 
till at last the excess of fluid on the one body breaks 
through the air and rushes to the other body in a form 
accompanied by light and noise when this transfer has 
taken place the attraction ceases the positive and the 
negative fluid having neutralized each other their 
effort was to unite and this union being effected there 
is no longer any force in action bodies in their natural 
unexcited condition may be considered as occupied by a 
combination of the two fluids and hence we see how 
the production of either kind of electricity is necessarily 
accompanied with the production of an equivalent amount 
of the opposite kind 

 voltaic electricity such is the case in franklinic 
electricity that which is excited by the common elec 
trical machine in studying voltaic electricity we are 
led to the conviction that the fluid which is in a condition 
of momentary equilibrium in electrized conductors exists 
in the state of current in the voltaic circuit and here 
we find polar relations of a new kind existing among 
the forces two voltaic currents attract each other when 



application of the idea of polarity 

they are moving in the same and repel each other when 
they are moving in opposite directions 

but we find in addition to these other polar relations 
of a more abstruse kind and which the supposition of 
two fluids does not so readily explain for instance if 
such fluids existed distinct from each other it might 
be expected that it would be possible to exhibit one 
of them separate from the other yet in all the phe 
nomena of electromotive currents we attempt in vain 
to obtain one kind of electricity separately i have 
not says mr faraday been able to find a single 
fact which could be adduced to prove the theory of 
two electricities rather than one in electric currents 
or admitting the hypothesis of two electricities have 
i been able to perceive the slightest grounds that one 
electricity can be more powerful than the other or 
that it can be present without the other or that it 
can be varied or in the slightest degree affected without 
a corresponding variation in the other thus he 
adds the polar character of the powers is rigorous and 
complete thus we too may remark all the super 
fluous and precarious parts gradually drop off from the 
hypothesis which we devise in order to represent polar 
phenomena and the abstract notion of polarity of equal 
and opposite powers called into existence by a com 
mon condition remains unincumbered with extraneous 
machinery 

 light another very important example of the 
application of the idea of polarity is that supplied by the 
discovery of the polarization of light a ray of light 
may by various processes be modified so that it has dif 
ferent properties according to its different sides although 
this difference is not perceptible by any common effects 
if for instance a ray thus modified pass perpendicularly

through a circular glass and fall upon the eye we may 
turn the glass round and round its frame and we shall 
make no difference in the brightness of the spot which 
we see but if instead of a glass we look through a 
longitudinal slice of tourmaline the spot is alternately 
dark and bright as we turn the crystal through successive 
quadrants here we have a contrast of properties dark 
and bright corresponding to a contrast of positions the 
position of a line east and west being contrasted with 
the position north and south which as we have said is 
the general character of polarity it was with a view of 
expressing this character that the term polarization was 
originally introduced malus was forced by his disco 
veries into the use of this expression we find he 
says in that light acquires properties which are 
relative only to the sides of the ray which are the same 
for the north and south sides of the ray using the 
points of the compass for descriptions sake only and 
which are different when we go from the north and south 
to the east or to the west sides of the ray i shall give 
the name of poles to these sides of the ray and shall call 
polarization the modification which gives to light these 
properties relative to these poles i have put off hitherto 
the admission of this term into the description of the 
physical phenomena with which we have to do i did 
not date to introduce it into the memoirs in which i 
published my last observations but the variety of forms 
in which this new phenomenon appears and the difficulty 
of describing them compel me to admit this new expres 
sion which signifies simply the modification which light 
has undergone in acquiring new properties which are not 
relative to the direction of the ray but only to its sides 
considered at right angles to each other and in a plane 
perpendicular to its direction 

the theory which represents light as an emission of 



application of the idea of polarity 

particles was in vogue at the time when malus published 
his discoveries and some of his followers in optical 
research conceived that the phenomena which he thus 
described rendered it necessary to ascribe poles and an 
axis to each particle of light on this hypothesis light 
would be polarized when the axes of all the particles 
were in the same direction and making such a suppo 
sition it may easily be conceived capable of transmission 
through a crystal whose axis is parallel to that of the 
luminous particles and intransmissible when the axis of 
the crystal is in a position transverse to that of the par 
ticles 

the hypothesis of particles possessing poles is a rude 
and arbitrary assumption in this as in other cases but it 
serves to convey the general notion of polarity which is 
the essential feature of the phenomena the term 
 polarization of light has sometimes been complained of 
in modern times as hypothetical and obscure but the 
real cause of obscurity was that the idea of polarity was 
till lately very imperfectly developed in mens minds 
as we have seen the general notion of polarity oppo 
site properties in opposite directions exactly describes 
the character of the optical phenomena to which the 
term is applied 

it is to be recollected that in optics we never speak 
of the poles but of the plane of polarization of a ray the 
word sides which newton and malus have used neither 
of them appears to have been satisfied with newton in 
employing it had recourse to the strange gallicism of 
speaking of the coast of usual and of unusual refraction 
of a crystal 

the modern theory of optics represents the plane of 

polarization of light as depending not on the position in 

which the axes of the luminiferous particles lie but on 

the direction of those transverse vibrations in which light 

vol i z 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

consists this theory is as we have stated in the his 
tory recommended by an extraordinary series of suc 
cesses in accounting for the phenomena and this 
hypothesis of transverse vibrations shows us another 
mechanical mode besides the hypothesis of particles 
with axes by which we may represent the polarity of a 
ray but we may remark that the general notion of 
polarity as applied to light in such cases would subsist 
even if the undulatory theory were rejected the idea 
is as we have before said independent of all hypothetical 
machinery 

i need not here refer to the various ways in which 
light may be polarized as for instance by being reflected 
from the surface of water or of glass at certain angles by 
being transmitted through crystals and in other ways 
in all cases the modification produced the polarization 
is identically the same property nor need i mention 
the various kinds of phenomena which appear as contrasts 
in the result for these are not merely light and dark or 
white and black but red and green and generally a 
colour and its complementary colour exhibited in many 
complex and varied configurations these multiplied 
modes in which polarized light presents itself add nothing 
to the original conception of polarization and i shall 
therefore pass on to another subject 

 crystallization bodies which are perfectly crys 
tallized exhibit the most complete regularity and sym 
metry of form and this regularity not only appears in 
their outward shape but pervades their whole texture 
and manifests itself in their cleavage their transparency 
and in the uniform and determinate optical properties 
which exist in every part even the smallest fragment of 
the mass if we conceive crystals as composed of par 
ticles we must suppose these particles to be arranged in 
the most regular manner for example if we suppose 



application of the idea of polarity 

each particle to have an axis we must suppose all these 
axes to be parallel for the direction of the axis of the 
particles is indicated by the physical and optical pro 
perties of the crystal and therefore this direction must 
be the same for every portion of the crystal this 
parallelism of the axes of the particles may be con 
ceived to result from the circumstance of each particle 
having poles the opposite poles attracting each other 
in virtue of forces acting as this hypothesis assumes a 
collection of small magnetic particles would arrange 
themselves in parallel positions and such a collection of 
magnetic particles offers a sort of image of a crystal 
thus we are led to conceive the particles of crystals as 
polarized and as determined in their crystalline positions 
by polar forces this mode of apprehending the consti 
tution of crystals has been adopted by some of our most 
eminent philosophers thus berzelius says it is 
demonstrated that the regular forms of bodies presuppose 
an effort of their atoms to touch each other by preference 
in certain points that is they are founded upon a pola 
rity he adds a polarity which can be no other than 
an electric or magnetic polarity in this latter clause 
we have the identity of different kinds of polarity 
asserted a principle which we shall speak of in the 
next chapter but we may remark that even without 
dwelling upon this connexion any notion which we can 
form of the structure of crystals necessarily involves the 
idea of polarity whether this polarity necessarily 
requires us to believe crystals to be composed of atoms 
which exert an effort to touch each other in certain points 
by preference is another question and in agreement 
with what has been said respecting other kinds of polarity 
we shall probably find on a more profound examination 
of the subject that while the idea of polarity is essential 

 essay on the theory of chemical properties p 

z 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

the machinery by which it is thus expressed is precarious 
and superfluous 

 chemical affinity we shall have in the next 
book to speak of chemical affinity at some length but 
since the ultimate views to which philosophers have been 
led induce them to consider the forces of affinity as 
polar forces we must enumerate these among the exam 
ples of polarity in chemical processes opposites tend 
to unite and to neutralize each other by their union 
thus an acid or an alkali combine with vehemence and 
form a compound a neutral salt which is neither acid 
nor alkaline 

this conception of contrariety and mutual neutraliza 
tion involves the idea of polarity in the conception as 
entertained by the earlier chemists the idea enters very 
obscurely but in the attempts which have more recently 
been made to connect this relation of acid and base with 
other relations the chemical elements have been conceived 
as composed of particles which possess poles like poles 
repelling and unlike attracting each other as they do in 
magnetic and electric phenomena this is however a rude 
and arbitrary way of expressing polarity and as may be 
easily shown involves many difficulties which do not 
belong to the idea itself mr faraday who has been 
led by his researches to a conviction of the polar nature 
of the forces of chemical affinity has expressed their 
character in a more general manner and without any of 
the machinery of particles indued with poles accord 
ing to his view chemical synthesis and analysis must 
always be conceived as taking place in virtue of equal 
and opposite forces by which the particles are united or 
separated these forces by the very circumstance of 
their being polar may be transferred from point to point 
for if we conceive a string of particles and if the positive 
force of the first particle be liberated and brought into 



application of the idea of polarity 

action its negative force also must be set free this 
negative force neutralizes the positive force of the next 
particle and therefore the negative force of this particle 
before employed in neutralizing its positive force is set 
free this is in the same way transferred to the next 
particle and so on and thus we have a positive force 
active at one extremity of a line of particles correspond 
ing to a negative force at the other extremity all the 
intermediate particles reciprocally neutralizing each others 
action this conception of the transfer of chemical action 
was indeed at an earlier period introduced by grotthus 
and confirmed by davy but in mr faradays hands 
we see it divested of all that is superfluous and spoken 
of not as a line of particles but as an axis of power 
having at every point contrary forces exactly equal 
in opposite directions 

 general remarks thus as we see the notion of 
polarity is applicable to many large classes of phenomena 
yet the idea in a distinct and general form is only of 
late growth among philosophers it has gradually been 
abstracted and refined from many extraneous hypotheses 
which were at first supposed to be essential to it we 
have noticed some of these hypotheses as the poles of 
a body the poles of the particles of a fluid two oppo 
site fluids a single fluid in excess and defect transverse 
vibrations to these others might be added thus dr 
proutf assumes that the polarity of molecules results 
from their rotation on their axes the opposite motions 
of contiguous molecules being the cause of opposite 
positive and negative polarities 

but none of these hypotheses can be proved by the 
fact of polarity alone and they have been in succession 
rejected when they had been assumed on that ground 

 dumas lemons sur la philosophic chimique p 
t bridgwater treatise p 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

thus davy in speaking of chemical forces says 
 in assuming the idea of two ethereal subtile elastic 
fluids attractive of the particles of each other and 
repulsive as to their own particles capable of combining 
in different proportions with bodies and according to 
their proportions giving them their specific qualities and 
rendering them equivalent masses it would be natural 
to refer the action of the poles to the repulsions of the 
substances combined with the excess of one fluid and 
the attractions of those united to the excess of the other 
fluid and a history of the phenomena not unsatisfactory 
to the reason might in this way be made out but as it 
is possible likewise to take an entirely different view of 
the subject on the idea of the dependence of the results 
upon the primary attractive powers of the parts of the 
combination on a single subtile fluid i shall not enter 
into any discussion on this obscure part of the theory 
which of these theories will best represent the case will 
depend upon the consideration of other facts in combi 
nation with the polar phenomena as we see in the history 
of optical theory in like manner mr faraday proved 
by experiment f the error of all theories which ascribe 
electrochemical decomposition to the attraction of the 
poles of the voltaic battery 

in order that they may distinctly image to them 
selves the idea of polarity men clothe it in some of 
the forms of machinery above spoken of yet every 
new attempt shows them the unnecessary difficulties in 
which they thus involve themselves but on the other 
hand it is difficult to apprehend this idea divested of 
all machinery and to entertain it in such a form that 
it shall apply at the same time to magnetism and elec 
tricity galvanism and chemistry crystalline structure and 
light the idea of polarity becomes most pure and genu

application of the idea of polarity 

ine when we entirely reject the conception of poles as 
faraday has taught us to do in considering electrochemical 
decomposition but it is only by degrees and by effort that 
we can reach this point of abstraction and generality 

 there is one other remark which we may here make 
it was a maxim commonly received in the ancient schools 
of philosophy that like attracts like but as we have 
seen the universal maxim of polar phenomena is that 
like repels like and attracts unlike the north pole 
attracts the south pole the positive fluid attracts the 
negative fluid opposite elements rush together opposite 
motions reduce each other to rest the permanent and 
stable course of things is that which results from the 
balance and neutralization of contrary tendencies 
nature is constantly labouring after repose by the effect 
of such tendencies and so far as polar forces enter into 
her economy she seeks harmony by means of discord 
and unity by opposition 

although the idea of polarity is still somewhat vague 
and obscure even in the minds of the cultivators of 
physical science it has still given birth to some general 
principles which have been accepted as evident and 
have had great influence on the progress of science 
these we shall now consider 



chapter ii 
of the connexion of polarities 

 it has appeared in the preceding chapter that in 
cases in which the phenomena suggest to us the idea of 
polarity we are also led to assume some material ma 
chinery as the mode in which the polar forces are exerted 
we assume for instance globular particles which possess 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

poles or the vibrations of a fluid or two fluids attracting 
each other in every case in short some hypothesis by 
which the existence and operation of the polarity is 
embodied in geometrical and mechanical properties of a 
medium nor is it possible for us to avoid proceeding 
upon the conviction that some such hypothesis must be 
true although the nature of the connexion between 
the mechanism and the phenomena must still be inde 
finite and arbitrary 

but since each class of polar phenomena is thus 
referred to an ulterior cause of which we know no more 
than that it has a polar character it follows that different 
polarities may result from the same cause manifesting 
its polar character under different aspects taking for 
example the hypothesis of globular particles if electricity 
result from an action dependent upon the poles of each 
globule magnetism may depend upon an action in the 
equator of each globule or taking the supposition of 
transverse vibrations if polarized light result directly 
from such vibrations crystallization may have reference 
to the axes of the elasticity of the medium by which the 
vibrations are rendered transverse so far as the polar 
character only of the phenomena is to be accounted for i 
say this may be so in so far only as the polar character of 
the phenomena is concerned for whether the relation of 
electricity to magnetism or of crystalline forces to light 
can really be explained by such hypotheses remains to 
be determined by the facts themselves but since the 
first necessary feature of the hypothesis is that it shall 
give polarity and since an hypothesis which does this may 
by its mathematical relations give polarities of different 
kinds and in different directions any two coexistent 
kinds of polarity may result from the same cause mani 
festing itself in various manners 

the conclusion to which we are led by these general 



of the connexion of polarities 

considerations is that two coexisting classes of polar 
phenomena may be effects of the same cause but those 
who have studied such phenomena more deeply and 
attentively have in most or in all cases arrived at the 
conviction that the various kinds of polarity in such cases 
must be connected and fundamentally identical as this 
conviction has exercised a great influence both upon the 
discoveries of new facts and upon the theoretical specu 
lations of modern philosophers and has been put forward 
by some writers as a universal principle of science i will 
consider some of the cases in which it has been thus 
applied 

 connexion of magnetic and electric polarity 
the polar phenomena of electricity and magnetism are 
clearly analogous in their laws and obvious facts showed 
at an early period that there was some connexion between 
the two agencies attempts were made to establish an 
evident and definite relation between the two kinds of 
force which attempts proceeded upon the principle now 
under consideration namely that in such cases the two 
kinds of polarity must be connected professor ersted 
of copenhagen was one of those who made many trials 
founded upon this conviction yet all these were long 
unsuccessful at length in he discovered that a 
galvanic current passing at right angles near to a mag 
netic needle exercises upon it a powerful deflecting 
force the connexion once detected between magnetism 
and galvanism was soon recognised as constant and 
universal it was represented in different hypothetical 
modes by different persons some considering the gal 
vanic current as the primitive axis and the magnet as 
constituted of galvanic currents passing round it at right 
angles to the magnetic axis while others conceived the 
magnetic axis as the primitive one and the electric 
current as implying a magnetic current round the wire 



 philosophy of the mechanicochemical sciences 

so far as many of the general relations of these two kinds 
of force were concerned either mode of representation 
served to express them and thus the assumption that 
the two polarities the magnetic and the electric were 
fundamentally identical was verified so far as the phe 
nomena of magnetic attraction and the like were con 
cerned 

i need not here mention how this was further con 
firmed by the experiments in which by means of the 
forces thus brought into view a galvanic wire was made 
to revolve round a magnet and a magnet round a gal 
vanic wire in which artificial magnets were constructed 
of coils of galvanic wire and finally in which the gal 
vanic spark was obtained from the magnet the identity 
which sagacious speculators had divined even before it 
was discovered and which they had seen to be universal as 
soon as it was brought to light was completely manifested 
in every imaginable form 

the relation of the electric and magnetic polarities 
was found to be that they were transverse to each other 
and this relation exhibited under various conditions of 
form and position of the apparatus gave rise to very 
curious and unexpected perplexities the degree of com 
plication which this relation may occasion may be judged 
of from the number of constructions and modes of con 
ception offered by ersted wollaston faraday and others 
for the purpose of framing a technical memory of the 
results the magnetic polarity gives us the north and 
south poles of the needle the electric polarity makes the 
current positive and negative and these pairs of opposites 
are connected by relations of situation as above and below 
right and left and give rise to the resulting motion of 
the needle one way or the other 

 ampere by framing his hypotheses of the action of 
voltaic currents and the constitution of magnets reduced 



of the connexion of polarities 

all these technical rules to rigorous deductions from one 
general principle and thus the vague and obscure per 
suasion that there must be some connexion between elec 
tricity and magnetism so long an idle and barren conjec 
ture was unfolded into a complete theory according to 
which magnetic and electromotive actions are only two 
different manifestations of the same forces and all the 
abovementioned complex relations of polarities are re 
duced to one single polarity that of the electrodynamic 
current 

 as the idea of polarity was thus firmly established 
and clearly developed it became an instrument of reason 
ing thus it led ampere to maintain that the original 
or elementary forces in electrodynamic action could not 
be as m biot thought they were a statical couple but 
must be directly opposite to each other the same idea 
enabled mr faraday to carry on with confidence such 
reasonings as the following no other known power 
has like direction with that exerted between an electric 
current and a magnetic pole it is tangential while all 
other forces acting at a distance are direct hence if a 
magnetic pole on one side of a revolving plate follow its 
course by reason of its obedience to the tangential force 
exerted upon it by the very current of electricity which 
it has itself caused a similar pole on the other side of 
the plate should immediately set it free from this force 
for the currents which have to be formed by the two 
poles are in contrary directions and in article 
of his researches the same eminent philosopher infers 
that if electricity and magnetism are considered as the 
results of a peculiar agent or condition exerted in deter 
minate directions perpendicular to each other one must 
be by some means convertible into the other and this 
he was afterwards able to prove to be the case in fact

thus the principle that the coexistent polarities of 
magnetism and electricity are connected and fundamen 
tally identical is not only true but is far from being 
either vague or barren it has been a fertile source both 
of theories which have at present a very great probabi 
lity and of the discovery of new and striking facts we 
proceed to consider other similar cases 

 connexion of electrical and chemical polarities 
the doctrine that the chemical forces by which the ele 
ments of bodies are held together or separated are iden 
tical with the polar forces of electricity is a great dis 
covery of modern times so great and so recent indeed 
that probably men of science in general have hardly yet 
obtained a clear view and firm hold of this truth this 
doctrine is now however entirely established in the minds 
of the most profound and philosophical chemists of our 
time the complete developement and confirmation of 
this as of other great truths was preceded by more vague 
and confused opinions gradually tending to this point 
and the progress of thought and of research was impelled 
and guided in this as in similar cases by the persuasion 
that these coexistent polarities could not fail to be closely 
connected with each other while the ultimate and 
exact theory to which previous incomplete and transitory 
theories tended is still so new and so unfamiliar it must 
needs be a matter of difficulty and responsibility for a 
common reader to describe the steps by which truth has 
advanced from point to point i shall therefore in doing 
this guide myself mainly by the historical sketches of 
the progress of this great theory which fortunately for us 
have been given us by the two philosophers who have 
played by far the most important parts in the discovery 
davy and faraday 

it will be observed that we are concerned here with 
the progress of theory and not of experiment except so 



of the connexion of polarities 

far as it is confirmatory of theory in davys memoir 
of on the relations of electrical and chemical 
changes he gives the historical details to which i have 
alluded already in he had conjectured that all 
chemical decompositions might be polar in he 
attempted to confirm this conjecture and succeeded to 
his own satisfaction in establishing that the combina 
tions and decompositions by electricity were referable 
to the law of electrical attractions and repulsions and 
advanced the hypothesis as he calls it that chemical and 
electrical attractions were produced by the same cause 
acting in one case on particles in the other on masses 
this hypothesis was most strikingly confirmed by the 
authors being able to use electrical agency as a more 
powerful means of chemical decomposition than any 
which had yet been applied believing he adds that 
our philosophical systems are exceedingly imperfect i 
never attached much importance to this hypothesis but 
having formed it after a copious induction of facts and 
having gained by the application of it a number of prac 
tical results and considering myself as much the author 
of it as i was of the decomposition of the alkalies and 
having developed it in an elementary work as far as the 
present state of chemistry seemed to allow i have never 
he says criticized or examined the manner in which 
different authors have adopted or explained it contented 
if in the hands of others it assisted the arrangements of 
chemistry or mineralogy or became an instrument of dis 
covery when the doctrine had found an extensive 
acceptance among chemists attempts were made tb show 
that it had been asserted by earlier writers and though 
davy justly denies all value to these pretended anticipa 
tions they serve to show however dimly the working of 
that conviction of the connexion of coexistent proper

ties which all along presided in mens minds during this 
course of investigation bitter and winterl have been 
quoted davy says among other persons as having 
imagined or anticipated the relation between electrical 
powers and chemical affinities before the discovery of the 
pile of volta but whoever will read with attention 
hitters evidence that galvanic action exists in orga 
nized nature and winters prolusiones ad chemiam 
scbculi decimi noni will find nothing to justify this opi 
nion he then refers to the queries of newton at the 
end of his optics these he says contain more 
grand and speculative views that might be brought to 
bear upon this question than any found in the works of 
modern electricians but it is very unjust to the experi 
mentalists who by the laborious application of new in 
struments have discovered novel facts and analogies to 
refer them to any such suppositions as that all attractions 
chemical electrical magnetical and gravitative may de 
pend upon the same cause it is perfectly true that 
such vague opinions though arising from that tendency to 
generalize which is the essence of science are of no value 
except so far as they are both rendered intelligible and 
confirmed by experimental research 

the phenomena of chemical decomposition by means 
of the voltaic pile however led other persons to views 
very similar to those of davy thus grotthus in f 
published an hypothesis of the same kind the pile of 
volta he says is an electrical magnet of which each 
element that is each pair of plates has a positive and a 
negative pole the consideration of this polarity sug 
gested to me the idea that a similar polarity may come 
into play between the elementary particles of water 
when acted upon by the same electrical agent and i 
avow that this thought was for me a flash of light 

 phil trans p f chim ixriii

 the thought however though thus brought into 
being was very far from being as yet freed from vague 
ness superfluities and errors i have elsewhere noticed 
faradays remark on davys celebrated memoir of 
that the mode of action by which the effects take place 
is stated very generally so generally indeed that probably 
a dozen precise schemes of electrochemical action might 
be drawn up differing essentially from each other yet all 
agreeing with the statement there given when davy 
and others proceeded to give a little more definiteness 
and precision to the statement of their views they soon 
introduced into the theory features which it was after 
wards found necessary to abandon thusf both davy 
grotthus riffault and chompre ascribed electrical de 
composition to the action of the poles and some of them 
even pretended to assign the proportion in which the 
force of the pole diminishes as the distance from it in 
creases faraday as i have already stated showed that 
the polarity must be considered as residing not only in 
what had till then been called the poles but at every 
point of the circuit he ascribed electrochemical de 
composition to internal forces residing in the particles of 
the matter under decomposition not to external forces 
exerted by the poles hence he shortly afterwards pro 
posed to reject the word poles altogether and to employ 
instead the term electrode meaning the doors or passages 
of whatever surface formed by which the decomposed 
elements pass out what have been called the positive 
and negative poles he further termed the anode and 
cathode and he introduced some other changes in no 
menclature connected with these he then as i have

related in the history invented the voltaelectrometer 
which enabled him to measure the quantity of voltaic 
action and this he found to be identical vith the quantity 
of chemical affinity and he was thus led to the clearest 
view of the truth towards which he and his predecessors 
had so long been travelling that electrical and chemical 
forces are identical f 

 it will perhaps be said that this beautiful train of 
discovery was entirely due to experiment and not to any 
a priori conviction that coexistent polarities must be 
connected i trust i have sufficiently stated that such 
an a priori principle could not be proved nor even under 
stood without a most laborious and enlightened use of 
experiment but yet i think that the doctrine when once 
fully unfolded exhibited clearly and established as true 
takes possession of the mind with a more entire convic 
tion of its certainty and universality in virtue of the 
principle we are now considering when the theory has 
assumed so simple a form it appears to derive immense 
probability to say the least from its simplicity like 
the laws of motion when stated in its most general form 
it appears to carry with it its own evidence and thus 
this great theory borrows something of its character from 
the ideas which it involves as well as from the experi 
ments by which it was established 

 we may find in many of mr faradays subsequent 
reasonings clear evidence that this idea of the connexion 
of polarities as now developed is not limited in its appli 
cation to facts already known experimentally but like 
other ideas determines the philosophers researches into 
the unknown and gives us the form of knowledge even 
before we possess the matter thus he says in his thir 
teenth series t i have long sought and still seek for an 
effect or condition which shall be to statical electricity

what magnetic force is to current electricity for as the 
lines of discharge are associated with a certain transverse 
effect so it appeared to me impossible but that the lines 
of tension or of inductive action which of necessity pre 
cede the discharge should also have their correspondent 
transverse condition or effect other similar passages 
might be found 

i will now consider another case to which we may 
apply the principle of connected polarities 

 connexion of chemical and crystalline polarities 
the close connexion between the chemical affinity 
and the crystalline attraction of elements cannot be over 
looked bodies never crystallize but when their ele 
ments combine chemically and solid bodies which com 
bine when they do it most completely and exactly also 
crystallize the forces which hold together the elements 
of a crystal of alum are the same forces which make it a 
crystal there is no distinguishing between the two sets 
of forces 

both chemical and crystalline forces are polar as we 
stated in the last chapter but the polarity in the two 
cases is of a different kind the polarity of chemical 
forces is then put in the most distinct form when it is 
identified with electrical polarity the polarity of the 
particles of crystals has reference to their geometrical 
form and it is clear that these two kinds of polarity 
must be connected accordingly berzelius expressly 
asserts the necessary identity of these two polarities 
 the regular forms of bodies suppose a polarity which 
can be no other than an electric or magnetic polarity 
this being so seemingly inevitable we might expect to 
find the electric forces manifesting some relation to the 
definite directions of crystalline forms mr faraday tried 
but in vain to detect some such relation he attempted 

 essay on chemical prop 
vol i a

to ascertain whether a cube of rock crystal transmitted 
the electrical force of tension with different intensity 
along and across the axis of the crystal in the first spe 
cimen there seemed to be some difference but in other 
experiments made both with rock crystal and with calc 
spar this difference disappeared although therefore we 
may venture to assert that there must be some very close 
connexion between electrical and crystalline forces we 
are as yet quite ignorant what the nature of the con 
nexion is and in what kind of phenomena it will manifest 
itself 

 connexion of crystalline and optical polarities 
crystals present to us optical phenomena which have a 
manifestly polar character the double refraction both 
of uniaxal and of biaxal crystals is always accompanied 
with opposite polarization of the two rays and in this 
and in other ways light is polarized in directions depen 
dent upon the axes of the crystalline form that is on 
the directions of the polarities of the crystalline particles 
the identity of these two kinds of polarity crystalline 
and optical is too obviou to need insisting on and it is 
not necessary for us here to decide by what hypothesis 
this identity may most properly be represented we 
may hereafter perhaps find ourselves justified in consider 
ing the crystalline forces as determining the elasticity of 
the luminiferous ether to be different in different direc 
tions within the crystal and thus as determining the 
refraction and polarization of the light which the crystal 
transmits but at present we merely note this case as 
an additional example of the manifest connexion and 
fundamental identity of two coexistent polarities 

 connexion of polarities in general thus we find 
that the connexion of different kinds of polarities mag 
netic electric chemical crystalline and optical is certain 

 researches art 



of the connexion of polarities 

as a truth of experimental science we have attempted 
to show further that in the minds of several of the most 
eminent discoverers and philosophers such a conviction 
is something more than a mere empirical result it is a 
principle which has regulated their researches while it 
was still but obscurely seen and imperfectly unfolded and 
has given to their theories a character of generality and 
selfevidence which experience alone cannot bestow 

it will perhaps be said that these doctrines that 
scientific researches may usefully be directed by prin 
ciples in themselves vague and obscure that theories 
may have an evidence superior to and anterior to experi 
ence are doctrines in the highest degree dangerous and 
utterly at variance with the soundest maxims of modern 
times respecting the cultivation of science 

to the justice and wisdom of this caution i entirely 
agree and although i have shown that this principle of 
the connexion of polarities rightly interpreted and esta 
blished in each case by experiment involves profound 
and comprehensive truths i think it no less important 
to remark that at least in the present stage of our know 
ledge we can make no use of this principle without 
taking care at every step to determine by clear and deci 
sive experiments its proper meaning and application 
all endeavours to proceed otherwise have led and must 
lead to ignorance and confusion attempts to deduce 
from our bare idea of polarity and our fundamental con 
victions respecting the connexion of polarities theories 
concerning the forces which really exist in nature can 
hardly have any other result than to bewilder mens 
minds and to misdirect their efforts 

so far indeed as this persuasion of a connexion 
among apparently different kinds of agencies impels men 
engaged in the pursuit of knowledge to collect observa 
tions to multiply repeat and vary experiments and to

contemplate the result of these in all aspects and rela 
tions it may be an occasion of the most important dis 
coveries accordingly we find that the great laws of 
phenomena which govern the motions of the planets 
about the sun were first discovered by kepler in con 
sequence of his scrutinizing the recorded observations 
with an intense conviction of the existence of geome 
trical and arithmetical harmonies in the solar system 
perhaps we may consider the discovery of the connexion 
of magnetism and electricity by professor ersted in 
as an example somewhat of the same kind for he also 
was a believer in certain comprehensive but undefined 
relations among the properties of bodies and in conse 
quence of such views entertained great admiration for 
the prologue to the chemistry of the nineteenth century of 
winterl already mentioned m ersted in pub 
lished a summary of this work and in so doing praised 
the views of winterl as far more profound and compre 
hensive than those of lavoisier soon afterwards a 
review of this publication appeared in france in which 
it was spoken of as a work only fit for the dark ages and 
as the indication of a sect which had for some time 
ravaged germany and inundated that country with 
extravagant and unintelligible mysticism it was there 
fore a kind of triumph to m ersted to be after some 
years labour the author of one of the most remarkable 
and fertile physical discoveries of his time 

 it was not indeed without some reason that cer 
tain of the german philosophers were accused of dealing in 
doctrines vast and profound in their aspect but in reality 
indefinite ambiguous and inapplicable and the most 
prominent of such doctrines had reference to the prin 
ciple now under our consideration they represented the 
properties of bodies as consisting in certain polarities 

 ann ckim torn p 



or the connexion of polarities 

and professed to deduce from the very nature of things 
with little or no reference to experiment the existence 
and connexion of these polarities thus schelling in 
his ideas towards a philosophy of nature published in 
 says magnetism is the universal act of investing 
multiplicity with unity but the universal form of the 
reduction of multiplicity to unity is the line pure lon 
gitudinal extension hence magnetism is determination 
of pure longitudinal extension and as this manifests 
itself by absolute cohesion magnetism is the determina 
tion of absolute cohesion and as magnetism was by 
such reasoning conceived to be proved as a universal 
property of matter schelling asserted t to be a confir 
mation of his views when it was discovered that other 
bodies besides iron are magnetic in like manner he used 
such expressions as the folio wingf the threefold 
character of the universal the particular and the indif 
ference of the two as expressed in their identity is 
magnetism as expressed in their difference is electricity 
and as expressed in the totality is chemical process 
thus these forms are only one form and the chemical 
process is a mere transfer of the three points of magnet 
ism into the triangle of chemistry 

it was very natural that the chemists should refuse 
to acknowledge in this fanciful and vague language 
delivered however it is to be recollected in an 
anticipation of davys doctrine of the identity of electrical 
and chemical forces or of ersteds electromagnetic 
agency yet it was perhaps no less natural that the 
author of such assertions should look upon every great 
step in the electrochemical theory as an illustration 
of his own doctrines accordingly we find schelling 
welcoming with a due sense of their importance the dis 
coveries of faraday when he heard of the experiment 

 p p g

in which electricity was produced from common mag 
netism he fastened with enthusiasm upon the discovery 
even before he knew any of its details and proclaimed 
it at a public meeting of a scientific body as one of the 
most important advances of modern science we have 
he thus reasoned three effects of polar forces electro 
chemical decomposition electrical action magnetism 
volta and davy had confirmed experimentally the identity 
of the two former agencies ersted showed that a closed 
voltaic circuit acquired magnetic properties but in 
order to exhibit the identity of electric and magnetic 
action it was requisite that electric forces should be 
extricated from magnetic this great step faraday he 
remarked had made in producing the electric spark by 
means of magnets 

 although conjectures and assertions of the kind 
thus put forth by schelling involve a persuasion of the 
pervading influence and connexion of polarities which 
persuasion has already been confirmed in many instances 
they involve this principle in a manner so vague and 
ambiguous that it can rarely in such a form be of 
any use or value such views of polarity can never 
teach us in what cases we are and in what we are not 
to expect to find polar relations and indeed tend rather 
to diffuse error and confusion than to promote know 
ledge accordingly we cannot be surprised to find such 
doctrines put forward by their authors as an evidence of 
the small value and necessity of experimental science 
this is done by the celebrated metaphysician hegel in 
his encyclopedia since says he the plane of 
incidence and of reflection in simple reflection is the 
same plane when a second reflector is introduced which 
further distributes the illumination reflected from the 

 ueber faradays neueste entdeckung milnchen 
f sec 



of the connexion of polarities 

first the position of the first plane with respect to the 
second plane containing the direction of the first reflection 
and of the second has its influence upon the position 
illumination or darkening of the object as it appears 
by the second reflection this influence must be the 
strongest when the two planes are what we must call 
negatively related to each other that is when they are 
at right angles but he adds when men infer as 
malus has done from the modification which is produced 
by this situation in the illumination of the reflection 
that the molecules of light in themselves that is on their 
different sides possess different physical energies and 
when on this foundation along with the phenomena of 
entoptical colours therewith connected a wide labyrinth 
of the most complex theory is erected we have then 
one of the most remarkable examples of the inferences of 
physics from experiment if hegels reasoning prove 
anything it must prove that polarization always accom 
panies reflection under such circumstances as he describes 
yet all physical philosophers know that in the case of 
metals in which the reflection is most complete light is 
not completely polarized at any angle and that in other 
substances the polarization depends upon various circum 
stances which show how idle and inapplicable is the 
account he thus gives of the property his selfcom 
placent remark about the inferences of physics from 
experiment is intended to recommend by comparison his 
own method of considering the nature of things in them 
selves a mode of obtaining physical truth which had 
been more than exhausted by aristotle and out of which 
no new attempts have extracted anything of value since 
his time 

 thus the general conclusion to which we are led 
on this subject is that the persuasion of the existence and 
connexion or identity of various polarities in nature 



 philosophy of the mechancochemical sciences 

although very naturally admitted and in many cases 
interpreted and confirmed by observed facts is of itself 
so far as we at present possess it a very insecure guide 
to scientific doctrines when it is allowed to dictate 
our theories instead of animating and extending our 
experimental researches it leads only to error confusion 
obscurity and mysticism 

this fifth book on the subject of polarities is a 
short one compared with most of the others this 
arises in a great measure from the circumstance that the 
idea of polarity has only recently been apprehended and 
applied with any great degree of clearness among phy 
sical philosophers and is even yet probably entertained 
in an obscure and ambiguous manner by most experimental 
inquirers i have been desirous of not attempting to 
bring forward any doctrines upon the subject except 
such as have been fully illustrated and exemplified by the 
acknowledged progress of the physical sciences if i 
had been willing to discuss the various speculations 
which have been published respecting the universal pre 
valence of polarities in the universe and their results in 
every province of nature i might easily have presented 
this subject in a more extended form but this would 
not have been consistent with my plan of tracing the 
influence of scientific ideas only so far as they have really 
aided in disclosing and developing scientific truths and 
as the influence of this idea is clearly distinguishable 
both from those which precede and those which follow in 
the character of the sciences to which it gives rise and 
appears likely to be hereafter of great extent and conse 
quence it seemed better to treat of it in a separate 
book although of a brevity disproportioned to the rest

attempts to conceive elementary 
composition 

 we have now to bring into view if possible the 
ideas and general principles which are involved in che 
mistry the science of the composition of bodies for in 
this as in other parts of human knowledge we shall find 
that there are certain ideas deeply seated in the mind 
though shaped and unfolded by external observation which 
are necessary conditions of the existence of such a science 
these ideas it is which impel man to such a knowledge 
of the composition of bodies which give meaning to facts 
exhibiting this composition and universality to special 
truths discovered by experience these are the ideas of 
element and of substance 

unlike the idea of polarization of which we treated 
in the last book these ideas have been current in mens 
minds from very early times and formed the subject of 
some of the first speculations of philosophers it hap 
pened however as might have been expected that in the 
first attempts they were not clearly distinguished from 
other notions and were apprehended and applied in an 
obscure and confused manner we cannot better ex 
hibit the peculiar character and meaning of these ideas 
than by tracing the form which they have assumed and 



 philosophy of chemistry 

the efficacy which they have exerted in these successive 
essays this therefore i shall endeavour to do begin 
ning with the idea of element 

 that bodies are composed or made up of certain 
parts elements or principles is a conception which has 
existed in mens minds from the beginning of the first 
attempts at speculative knowledge the doctrine of the 
four elements earth air fire and water of which all 
things in the universe were supposed to be constituted is 
one of the earliest forms in which this conception was 
systematized and this doctrine is stated by various 
authors to have existed as early as the times of the 
ancient egyptians the words usually employed by 
greek writers to express these elements are upx prin 
ciple or beginning and oroetov which probably meant 
a letter of a word before it meant an element of a 
compound for the resolution of a word into its letters 
is undoubtedly a remarkable instance of a successful 
analysis performed at an early stage of mans history 
and might very naturally supply a metaphor to denote 
the analysis of substances into their intimate parts when 
men began to contemplate such an analysis as a subject 
of speculation the latin word elementum itself though 
by its form it appears to be a derivative abstract term 
comes from some root now obsolete probably f from a 
word signifying to grow or spring up 

the mode in which elements form the compound 
bodies and determine their properties was at first as 
might be expected vaguely and variously conceived it

conception of elementary composition 

peculiar and appropriate fundamental idea not suscept 
ible of being correctly represented by any comparison or 
combination of other ideas and guiding us to clear and 
definite results only when it is illustrated and nourished 
by an abundant supply of experimental facts but at first 
the peculiar and special notion which is required in a just 
conception of the constitution of bodies was neither dis 
cerned nor suspected and up to a very late period in the 
history of chemistry men went on attempting to appre 
hend the constitution of bodies more clearly by substitu 
ting for this obscure and recondite idea of elementary 
composition some other idea more obvious more lumi 
nous and more familiar such as the ideas of resemblance 
position and mechanical force we shall briefly speak of 
some of these attempts and of the errors which were 
thus introduced into speculations on the relations of 
elements and compounds 

 compounds assumed to resemble their elements 
the first notion was that compounds derive their qualities 
from their elements by resemblance they are hot in 
virtue of a hot element heavy in virtue of a heavy 
element and so on in this way the doctrine of tlivfour 
elements was framed for every body is either hot or 
cold moist or dry and by combining these qualities in 
all possible ways men devised four elementary sub 
stances as has been stated in the history 

this assumption of the derivation of the qualities of 
bodies from similar qualities in the elements was as we 
shall see altogether baseless and unphilosophical yet it 
prevailed long and universally it was the foundation of 
medicine for a long period both in europe and asia 
disorders being divided into hot cold and the like and 
remedies being arranged according to similar distinctions 
many readers will recollect perhaps the story f of the

indignation which the persian physicians felt towards the 
european when he undertook to cure the ill effects of 
cucumber upon the patient by means of mercurial medi 
cine for cucumber which is cold could not be coun 
teracted they maintained by mercury which in their 
classification is cold also similar views of the operation 
of medicines might easily be traced in our own country 
a moments reflection may convince us that when drugs 
of any kind are subjected to the chemistry of the 
human stomach and thus made to operate on the human 
frame it is utterly impossible to form the most remote 
conjecture what the result will be from any such vague 
notions of their qualities as the common use of our 
senses can give and in like manner the common 
operations of chemistry give rise in almost every instance 
to products which bear no resemblance to the materials 
employed the results of the furnace the alembic the 
mixture frequently bear no visible resemblance to the 
ingredients operated upon iron becomes steel by the 
addition of a little charcoal but what visible trace of 
the charcoal is presented by the metal thus modified 
the most beautiful colours are given to glass and 
earthenware by minute portions of the ores of black or 
dingy metals as iron and manganese the worker in 
metal the painter the dyer the vintner the brewer 
all the artisans in short who deal with practical 
chemistry are able to teach the speculative chemist 
that nothing can be so false as to expect that the 
qualities of the elements shall be still discoverable in 
an unaltered form in the compound this first rude 
notion of an element that it determines the properties 
of bodies by resemblance must be utterly rejected and 
abandoned before we can make any advance towards a 
true apprehension of the constitution of bodies 

 this step accordingly was made when the hypo 



conception of elementary composition 

thesis of the four elements was given up and the doctrine 
of the three principles salt sulphur and mercury was sub 
stituted in its place for in making this change as i 
have remarked in the history the real advance was the 
acknowledgment of the changes produced by the chemists 
operations as results to be accounted for by the union 
and separation of substantial elements however great 
the changes and however unlike the product might be 
to the materials and this step once made chemists 
went on constantly advancing towards a truer view of 
the nature of an element and consequently towards a 
more satisfactory theory of chemical operations 

 yet we may i think note one instance even in the 
works of eminent modem chemists in which this maxim 
that we have no right to expect any resemblance between 
the elements and the compound is lost sight of i speak 
of certain classifications of mineral substances berzelius 
in his system of mineral arrangement places sulphur next 
to the sulphurets but surely this is an error involving 
the ancient assumption of the resemblance of elements 
and compounds as if we were to expect the sulphurets 
to bear a resemblance to sulphur all classifications are 
intended to bring together things resembling each other 
the sulphurets of metals have certain general resem 
blances which make them a tolerably distinct well 
determined class of bodies but sulphur has no resem 
blances with these no analogies with them either in 
physical or even in chemical properties it is a simple 
body and both its resemblances and its analogies direct 
us to place it along with other simple bodies selenium 
and phosphorus which united with metals produce com 
pounds not very different from the sulphurets sulphur 
cannot be nor approach to being a sulphuret we must 
not confound what it is with what it makes sulphur has

its proper influence in determining the properties of the 
compound into which it enters but it does not do this 
according to resemblance of qualities or according to any 
principle which properly leads to propinquity in classifi 
cation 

 compounds assumed to be determined by the figure of 
elements i pass over the fanciful modes of representing 
chemical changes which were employed by the alche 
mists for these strange inventions did little in leading 
men towards a juster view of the relations of elements to 
compounds i proceed for an instant to the attempt to 
substitute another obvious conception for the still obscure 
notion of elementary composition it was imagined that 
all the properties of bodies and their mutual operations 
might be accounted for by supposing them constituted of 
particles of various forms round or angular pointed or 
hooked straight or spiral this is a very ancient hypo 
thesis and a favourite one with many casual speculators 
in all ages thus lucretius undertakes to explain why 
wine passes rapidly through a sieve and oil slowly by 
telling us that the latter substance has its particles either 
larger than those of the other or more hooked and inter 
woven together and he accounts for the difference of 
sweet and bitter by supposing the particles in the former 
case to be round and smooth in the latter sharp and 
jagged similar assumptions prevailed in modern times 
on the revival of the mechanical philosophy and consti 
tute a large part of the physical schemes of descartes 
and gassendi they were also adopted to a considerable 
extent by the chemists acids were without hesitation 
assumed to consist of sharp pointed particles which i 
hope lemery saysf no one will dispute seeing every 
ones experience does demonstrate it he needs but taste 
an acid to be satisfied of it for it pricks the tongue like 

 de rerum natura ii sqq t chemistry p 



conception of elementary composition 

anything keen and finely cut such an assumption is 
not only altogether gratuitous and useless but appears to 
be founded in some degree upon a confusion in the meta 
phorical and literal use of such words as keen and sharp 
the assumption once made it was easy to accommodate 
it in a manner equally arbitrary to other facts a 
demonstrative and convincing proof that an acid does 
consist of pointed parts is that not only all acid salts do 
crystallize into edges but all dissolutions of different 
things caused by acid liquors do assume this figure in 
their crystallization these crystals consist of points 
differing both in length and bigness one from another 
and this diversity must be attributed to the keener or 
blunter edges of the different sorts of acids and so like 
wise this difference of the points in subtilty is the cause 
that one acid can penetrate and dissolve with one sort of 
miivt that another cant rarify at all thus vinegar dis 
solves lead which aquafortis cant aqua fortis dissolves 
quicksilver which vinegar will not touch aqua regalis 
dissolves gold whenas aquafortis cannot meddle with it 
on the contrary aqua fortis dissolves silver but can do 
nothing with gold and so of the rest 

the leading fact of the vehement combination and 
complete union of acid and alkali readily suggested a fit 
form for the particles of the latter class of substances 
 this effect lemery adds may make us reasonably 
conjecture that an alkali is a terrestrious and solid matter 
whose forms are figured after such a manner that the 
acid points entering in do strike and divide whatever 
opposes their motion and in a like spirit are the 
speculations in dr meads mechanical account of poisons 
 thus he explains the poisonous effect of corrosive 
sublimate of mercury by saying that the particles of the 
salt are a kind of lamellae or blades to which the 

 p 



 philosophy of chemistry 

mercury gives an additional weight if resublimed with 
threefourths the quantity of mercury it loses its corro 
siveness becoming calomel which arises from this that 
in sublimation the crystalline blades are divided every 
time more and more by the force of the fire and the 
broken pieces of the crystals uniting into little masses of 
differing figures from their former make those cutting 
points are now so much smaller that they cannot make 
wounds deep enough to be equally mischievous and 
deadly and therefore do only vellicate and twitch the 
sensible membranes of the stomach 

 among all this very fanciful and gratuitous assump 
tion we may notice one true principle clearly introduced 
namely that the suppositions which we make respecting 
the forms of the elementary particles of bodies and their 
mode of combination must be such as to explain the facts 
of crystallization as well as of mere chemical change 
this principle we shall hereafter have occasion to insist 
upon further 

i now proceed to consider a more refined form of 
assumption respecting the constitution of bodies yet still 
one in which a vain attempt is made to substitute for the 
peculiar idea of chemical composition a more familiar 
mechanical conception 

 compounds assumed to be determined by the mecha 
nical attraction of the elements when in consequence 
of the investigations and discoveries of newton and his 
predecessors the conception of mechanical force had 
become clear and familiar so far as the action of external 
forces upon a body was concerned it was very natural 
that the mathematicians who had pursued this train of 
speculation should attempt to apply the same conception 
to that mutual action of the internal parts of a body by 
which they are held together newton himself had 
pointed the way to this attempt in the preface to the 



conception of elementary composition 

principia after speaking of what he has done in calcu 
lating the effects of forces upon the planets satellites 
c he adds would it were permitted us to deduce the 
other phenomena of nature from mechanical principles 
by the same kind of reasoning for many things move 
me to suspect that all these phenomena depend upon 
certain forces by which the particles of bodies through 
causes not yet known are either urged towards each 
other and cohere according to regular figures or are 
repelled and recede from each other which forces being 
unknown philosophers have hitherto made their attempts 
upon nature in vain the same thought is at a later 
period followed out further in one of the queries at the 
end of the opticks have not the small particles of 
bodies certain powers virtues or forces by which they 
act at a distance not only upon the rays of light for 
reflecting refracting and inflecting them but also upon 
one another for producing a great part of the phenomena 
of nature and a little further on he proceeds to 
apply this expressly to chemical changes when salt 
of tartar runs per deliquium or as we now express it 
deliquesces is not this done by an attraction between the 
particles of the salt of tartar and the particles of the 
water which float in the air in the form of vapours 
and why does not common salt or saltpetre or vitriol 
run per deliquium but for want of such an attraction or 
why does not salt of tartar draw more water out of the 
air than in a certain proportion to its quantity but for 
want of an attractive force after it is saturated with 
water he goes on to put a great number of similar 
cases all tending to the same point that chemical com 
binations cannot be conceived in any other way than as 
an attraction of particles 

 succeeding speculators in his school attempted to

follow out this view dr frend of christ church in 
 published his prcelectiones gliymica in quibusomnes 
fere operationes vliymicce ad vera principia ex ipsius 
natures legibus rediguntur oxonii habita this book is 
dedicated to newton and in the dedication the promise 
of advantage to chemistry from the influence of the 
newtonian discoveries is spoken of somewhat largely 
much more largely indeed than has yet been justified by 
the sequel after declaring in strong terms that the 
only prospect of improving science consists in following 
the footsteps of newton the author adds that force 
of attraction of which you first so successfully traced 
the influence in the heavenly bodies operates in the most 
minute corpuscles as you long ago hinted in your prin 
cipia and have lately plainly shown in your opticks 
and this force we are only just beginning to perceive and 
to study under these circumstances i have been desir 
ous of trying what is the result of this view in chemistry 
the work opens formally enough with a statement of 
general mechanical principles of which the most peculiar 
are these that there exists an attractive force by which 
particles when at very small distances from each other 
are drawn together that this force is different accord 
ing to the different figure and density of the particles 
that the force may be greater on one side of a par 
ticle than on the other that the force by which par 
ticles cohere together arises from attraction and is vari 
ously modified according to the quantity of contacts 
but these principles are not applied in any definite 
manner to the explanation of specific phenomena he 
attempts indeed the question of special solvents why 
does aqua fortis dissolve silver and not gold while aqua 
regia dissolves gold and not silver which he says is 
the most difficult question in chemistry and which is 

 p 



conception of elementary composition 

certainly a fundamental one in the formation of chemical 
theory he solves it by certain assumptions respecting 
the forces of attraction of the particles and also the 
diameter of the particles of the acids and the pores of 
the metals all which suppositions are gratuitous 

 we may observe further that by speaking as i have 
stated that he does of the figure of particles he mixes to 
gether the assumption of the last section with the one 
which we are considering in this this combination is very 
unphilosophical or to say the least very insufficient since 
it makes a new hypothesis necessary if a body be com 
posed of cubical particles held together by their mutual 
attraction by what force are the parts of each cube held 
together in order to understand their structure we 
are obliged again to assume a cohesive force of the 
second order binding together the particles of each 
particle and therefore newton himself says very 
justly the parts of all homogeneal hard bodies which 
fully touch each other stick together very strongly and 
for explaining how this is some have invented hooked 
atoms which is begging the question for he means 
to imply how do the parts of the hook stick together 

the same remark is applicable to all hypotheses in 
which particles of a complex structure are assumed as the 
constituents of bodies for while we suppose bodies and 
their known properties to result from the mutual actions 
of these particles we are compelled tj suppose the parts 
of each particle to be held together by forces still more 
difficult to conceive since they are disclosed only by the 
properties of these particles which as yet are unknown 
yet newton himself has not abstained from such hypo 
theses thus he saysf a particle of a salt may be com 
pared to a chaos being dense hard dry and earthy in the 
centre and moist and watery in the circumference

 philosophy of chemistry 

since newtons time the use of the term attrac 
tion as expressing the cause of the union of the 
chemical elements of bodies has been familiarly con 
tinued and has no doubt been accompanied in the 
minds of many persons with an obscure notion that 
chemical attraction is in some way a kind of mechanical 
attraction of the particles of bodies yet this view has 
never so far as i am aware been worked out into a 
system of chemical theory nor even applied with any 
distinctness as an explanation of any particular chemical 
phenomena any such attempt indeed could only tend 
to bring more clearly into view the entire inadequacy of 
such a mode of explanation for the leading pheno 
mena of chemistry are all of such a nature that no 
mechanical combination can serve to express them with 
out an immense accumulation of additional hypotheses 
if we take as our problem the changes of colour 
transparency texture taste odour produced by small 
changes in the ingredients how can we expect to 
give a mechanical account of these till we can give 
a mechanical account of colour transparency texture 
taste odour themselves and if our mechanical hypo 
thesis of the elementary constitution of bodies does not 
explain such phenomena as those changes what can it 
explain or what can be the value of it i do not here 
insist upon a remark which will afterwards come before 
us that even crystalline form a phenomenon of a far 
more obviously mechanical nature than those just alluded 
to has never yet been in any degree explained by such 
assumptions as this that bodies consist of elementary 
particles exerting forces of the same nature as the central 
forces which we contemplate in mechanics 

when therefore newton asks when some stones 
as spar of lead dissolved in proper menstruums become 
salts do not these things show that salts are dry earth

and watery acid united by attraction f we may answer 
that this mode of expression appears to be intended to 
identify chemical combination with mechanical attrac 
tion that there would be no objection to any such 
identification if we could in that way explain or even 
classify well a collection of chemical facts but that 
this has never yet been done by the help of such expres 
sions till some advance of this kind can be pointed 
out we must necessarily consider the power which pro 
duces chemical combination as a peculiar principle a 
special relation of the elements not rightly expressed in 
mechanical terms and we now proceed to consider this 
relation under the name by which it is most familiarly 
known

establishment and development of the 
idea of chemical affinity 

 the earlier chemists did not commonly involve 
themselves in the confusion into which the mechanical 
philosophers ran of comparing chemical to mechanical 
forces their attention was engaged and their ideas 
were moulded by their own pursuits they saw that the 
connexion of elements and compounds with which they 
had to deal was a peculiar relation which must be studied 
directly and which must be understood if understood 
at all in itself and not by comparison with a dif 
ferent class of relations at different periods of the 
progress of chemistry the conception of this relation 
still vague and obscure was expressed in various man 
ners and at last this conception was clothed in tole 
rably consistent phraseology and the principles which it 
involved were by the united force of thought and expe 
riment brought into view 



 philosophy of chemistry 

 the power by which the elements of bodies com 
bine chemically being as we have seen a peculiar agency 
different from mere mechanical connexion or attraction 
it is desirable to have it designated by a distinct and 
peculiar name and the term affinity has been employed 
for that purpose by most modern chemists the word 
 affinity in common language means sometimes resem 
blance and sometimes relationship and ties of family 
it is from the latter sense that the metaphor is bor 
rowed when we speak of chemical affinity by the 
employment of this term we do not indicate resemblance 
but disposition to unite using the word in a common 
unscientific manner we might say that chlorine bromine 
and iodine have a great natural affinity with each other 
for there are considerable resemblances and analogies 

o 

among them but these bodies have very little chemical 
affinity for each other the use of the word in the 
former sense of resemblance can be traced in earlier 
chemists but it does not appear to have acquired its 
peculiar chemical meaning till after boerhaaves time 
boerhaave however is the writer in whom we first find 
a due apprehension of the peculiarity and importance 
of the idea which it now expresses when we make 
a chemical solution he says not only are the particles 
of the dissolved body separated from each other but 
they are closely united to the particles of the solvent 
when aqua regia dissolves gold do you not see he says 
to his hearers that there must be between each particle 
of the solvent and of the metal a mutual virtue by which 
each loves unites with and holds the other amat unity 
retinet the opinion previously prevalent had been that 
the solvent merely separates the parts of the body dis 
solved and most philosophers had conceived this separa 
tion as performed by mechanical operations of the par 
 elementa chemice lugd bat p 



idea of chemical affinity 

tides resembling for instance the operation of wedges 
breaking up a block of timber but boerhaave forcibly 
and earnestly points out the insufficiency of the concep 
tion this he says does not account for what we see 
we have not only a separation but a new combination 
there is a force by which the particles of the solvent 
associate to themselves the parts dissolved not a force by 
which they repel and dissever them we are here to 
imagine not mechanical action not violent impulse not 
antipathy but love at least if love be the desire of unit 
ing non igitur hie etiam actiones mechanicae non 
propulsiones violentae non inimicitiae cogitandae sed 
amicitiae si amor dicendus copulas cupido the novelty 
of this view is evidenced by the mode in which he apolo 
gizes for introducing it fateor paradoxa haec assertio 
to boerhaave therefore especially considering his great 
influence as a teacher of chemistry we may assign the 
merit of first diffusing a proper view of chemical affinity 
as a peculiar force the origin of almost all chemical 
changes and operations 

 to boerhaave is usually assigned also the credit of 
introducing the word affinity among chemists but i do 
not find that the word is often used by him in this sense 
perhaps not at all but however this may be the term is 

 see dumas legons de philos chim p rees cyclopaedia 
art chemistry in the passage of boerhaave to which i refer above 
affinitas is rather opposed to than identified with chemical combina 
tion when he says the parts of the body to be dissolved are 
dissevered by the solvent why do they remain united to the particles 
of the solvent and why do not rather both the particles of the solvent 
and of the dissolved body collect into homogeneous bodies by their 
affinity denuo se affinitate suse nature colligant in corpora homo 
genea and the answer is because they possess another force which 
counteracts this affinity of homogeneous particles and makes com 
pounds of different elements affinity in chemistry now means the 
tendency of different kinds of matter to unite but it appears as i 
have said to have acquired this sense since boerhaaves time 



 philosophy of chemistry 

on many accounts well worthy to be preserved as i shall 
endeavour to show other terms were used in the same 
sense during the early part of the eighteenth century 
thus when geoffroy in laid before the academy 
of paris his tables of affinities which perhaps did more 
than any other event to fix the idea of affinity he termed 
them tables of the relations of bodies tables des 
rapports speaking however also of their disposition 
to unite and using other phrases of the same import 

the term attraction having been recommended by 
newton as a fit word to designate the force which pro 
duces chemical combination continued in great favour in 
england where the newtonian philosophy was looked 
upon as applicable to every branch of science in france 
on the contrary where descartes stilt reigned triumphant 
 attraction the watchword of the enemy was a sound 
never uttered but with dislike and suspicion in 
in the notice of geoffreys tables the secretary of the 
academy after pointing out some of the peculiar circum 
stances of chemical combinations says sympathies and 
attractions would suit well here if there were such 
things les sympathies les attractions conviendroient 
bien ici si elles etaient quelque chose and at a later 
period in having to write the eloge of geoffroy 
after his death he says he gave in a singular 
system and a table of affinities or relations of the 
different substances in chemistry these affinities gave 
uneasiness to some persons who feared that they were 
attractions in disguise and all the more dangerous in con 
sequence of the seductive forms which clever people have 
contrived to give them it was found in the sequel that 
this scruple might be got over 

this is the earliest published instance so far as i am 
aware in which the word affinity is distinctly used for the 
cause of chemical composition and taking into account 



idea of chemical affinity 

the circumstances the word appears to have been adopted 
in france in order to avoid the word attraction which 
had the taint of newtonianism accordingly we find 
the word ajffinite employed in the works of french che 
mists from this time thus in the transactions of the 
french academy for in a paper of macquers upon 
arsenic he says on peut facilement rendre raison de 
ces phenomenes par le moyen des affinites que les dif 
ferens substances qui entrent dans ces combinaisons ont 
les uns avec les autres and he proceeds to explain the 
facts by reference to geoffreys table and in macquers 
elements of chemistry which appeared a few years later 
the affinity of composition is treated of as a leading 
part of the subject much in the same way as has been 
practised in such books up to the present time from 
this period the word appears to have become familiar to 
all european chemists in the sense of which we are now 
speaking thus in the year the academy of 
sciences at rouen offered a prize for the best dissertation 
on affinity the prize was shared between m limbourg 
of theux near liege and m le sage of geneva f 
about the same time other persons manherrj nicolai 
and others wrote on the same subject employing the 
same name 

nevertheless in the swedish chemist bergman 
pursuing still further this subject of chemical affinities 
and the expression of them by means of tables returned 
again to the old newtonian term and designated the 
disposition of a body to combine with one rather than

another of two others as elective attraction and as his 
work on elective attractions had great circulation and 
great influence this phrase has obtained a footing by the 
side of affinity and both one arid the other are now in 
common use among chemists 

 i have said above that the term affinity is worthy 
of being retained as a technical term if we use the 
word attraction in this case we identify or compare 
chemical with mechanical attraction from which iden 
tification and comparison as i have already remarked 
no one has yet been able to extract the means of ex 
pressing any single scientific truth if such an identifi 
cation or comparison be not intended the use of the 
same word in two different senses can only lead to con 
fusion and the proper course recommended by all the 
best analogies of scientific history is to adopt a peculiar 
term for that peculiar relation on which chemical com 
position depends the word affinity even if it were not 
rigorously proper according to its common meaning 
still being simple familiar and well established in this 
very usage is much to be preferred before any other 

but further there are some analogies drawn from 
the common meaning of this word which appear to 
recommend it as suitable for the office which it has 
to discharge for common mechanical attractions and 
repulsions the forces by which one body considered as a 
whole acts upon another external to it are as we have 
said to be distinguished from those more intimate ties 
by which the parts of each body are held together now 
this difference is implied if we compare the former rela 
tions the attractions and repulsions to alliances and wars 
between states and the latter the internal union of parti 
cles to those bonds of affinity which connect the citizens 
of the same state with one another and especially to the 
ties of family we have seen that boerhaave compares 



idea of chemical affinity 

the union of two elements of a compound to their mar 
riage we must allow says an eminent chemist of 
our own time that there is some truth in this poetical 
comparison it contains this truth that the two 
become one to most intents and purposes and that the 
unit thus formed the family is not a mere juxtaposition 
of the component parts and thus the idea of affinity as 
the peculiar principle of chemical composition is esta 
blished among chemists and designated by a familiar and 
appropriate name 

 analysis is possible we must however endea 
vour to obtain a further insight into this idea thus fixed 
and named we must endeavour to extricate if not 
from the idea itself from the processes by which it has 
obtained acceptation and currency among chemists some 
principles which may define its application some addi 
tional specialties in the relations which it implies this 
we shall proceed to do 

the idea of affinity as already explained implies a 
disposition to combine but this combination is to be 
understood as admitting also of a possibility of separa 
tion synthesis implies analysis as conceivable or to 
recur to the image which we have already used divorce 
is possible when the marriage has taken place 

that there is this possibility is a conviction implied in 
all the researches of chemists ever since the true notion of 
composition began to predominate in their investigations 
one of the first persons who clearly expressed this con 
viction was mayow an english physician who published 
his medicophysical tracts in the first of them 
de salenitro et spiritu nitroaerio contains a clear 
enunciation of this principle after showing how in the 
combinations of opposite elements as acid and alkali 
their properties entirely disappear and a new substance 
 dumas lemons de phil chim p 



 philosophy of chemistry 

is formed not at all resembling either of the ingredients 
he adds although these salts thus mixed appear to be 
destroyed it is still possible for them to be separated 
from each other with their powers still entire he 
proceeds to exemplify this and illustrates it by the same 
image which i have already alluded to salia acida a 
salibus volatilibus discedunt ut cum sale fixo tartari 
tanquam sponso magis idoneo conjugium strictius ineunt 
this idea of a synthesis which left a complete analysis still 
possible was opposed to a notion previously current that 
when two heterogeneous bodies united together and 
formed a third body the two constituents were entirely 
destroyed and the result formed out of their ruinsf 
and this conception of synthesis and analysis as processes 
which are possible successively and alternately and each 
of which supposes the possibility of the other has been 
the fundamental and regulative principle of the operations 
and speculations of analytical chemistry from the time of 
mayow to the present day 

 affinity is elective when the idea of chemical 
affinity or disposition to unite was brought into view by 
the experiments and reasonings of chemists they found 
it necessary to consider this disposition as elective 
each element chose one rather than another of the ele 
ments which were presented to it and quitted its union 
with one to unite with another which it preferred this 
has already appeared in the passage just quoted from 
mayow he adds in the same strain i have no doubt 
that fixed salts choose one acid rather than another in 
order that they may coalesce with it in a more intimate 
union nullus dubito salia fixa acidum unum prse 
aliis eligere ut cum eodem arctiore unione coalescant 
the same thought is expressed and exemplified by other 
chemists they notice innumerable cases in which when

an ingredient is combined with a liquid if a new sub 
stance be immersed which has a greater affinity for the 
liquid the liquid combines with the new substance by 
election and the former ingredient is precipitated thus 
stahl says in spirit of nitre dissolve silver put in 
copper and the silver is thrown down put in iron and 
the copper goes down put in zinc the iron precipitates 
put in volatile alkali the zinc is separated put in fixed 
alkali the volatile quits its hold as may be seen in 
this example we have in such cases not only a prefer 
ence but a long gradation of preferences the spirit of 
nitre will combine with silver but it prefers copper 
prefers iron more zinc still more volatile alkali yet 
more fixed alkali the most 

the same thing was proved to obtain with regard to 
each element and when this was ascertained it became 
the object of chemists to express these degrees of prefer 
ence by lists in which substances were arranged accord 
ing to their disposition to unite with another substance 
in this manner was formed geoffreys table of affinities 
 which we have already mentioned this table 
was further improved by other writers as gellert 
and limbo urg finally bergman improved these 
tables still further taking into account not only the 
order of affinities of each element for others but the sum 
of the tendencies to unite of each two elements which 
sum he held determined the resulting combination when 
several elements were in contact with each other 

 as we have stated in the history f when the doc 
trine of elective affinities had assumed this very definite 
and systematic form it was assailed by berthollet who 
maintained in his essai de statique chimique 
that chemical affinities are not elective that when 
various elements are brought together their combinations

do not depend upon the kind of elements alone but upon 
the quantity of each which is present that which is 
most abundant always entering most largely into the 
resulting compounds it may seem strange that it should 
be possible at so late a period of the science to throw 
doubt upon a doctrine which had presided over and 
directed its progress so long proust answered ber 
thollet and again maintained that chemical affinity is 
elective i have in the history given the judgment of 
berzelius upon this controversy berthollet he says 
 defended himself with an acuteness which makes the 
reader hesitate in his judgment but the great mass of 
facts finally decided the point in favour of proust i 
may here add the opinion pronounced upon this subject 
by dr turner bergman erred in supposing the 
result of chemical action to be in every case owing to 
elective affinity for this power is modified in its effects by 
various circumstances but berthollet ran into the oppo 
site extreme in declaring that the effects formerly ascribed 
to that power are never produced by it that chemical 
attraction is exerted between different bodies with dif 
ferent degrees of energy is i apprehend indisputable 
and he then proceeds to give many instances of differ 
ences in affinity which cannot be accounted for by the 
operation of any modifying causes still more recently 
m dumas has taken a review of this controversy and 
speaking with enthusiasm of the work of berthollet as 
one which had been of inestimable service to himself in 
his early study of chemistry he appears at first disposed 
to award to him the victory in this dispute but his 
final verdict leaves undamaged the general principle now 
under our consideration that chemical affinity is elective 
 for my own part he saysf i willingly admit the no

tions of berthollet when we have to do with acids or with 
bases of which the energy is nearly equal but when 
bodies endued with very energetic affinities are in pre 
sence of other bodies of which the affinities are very 
feeble i propose to adopt the following rule in a solu 
tion everything remaining dissolved the strong affinities 
satisfy themselves leaving the weak affinities to arrange 
matters with one another the strong acids take the 
strong bases and the weak acids can only unite with the 
weak bases the known facts are perfectly in accordance 
with this practical rule it is obvious that this recog 
nition of a distinction between strong and weak affinities 
which operates to such an extent as to determine entirely 
the result is a complete acknowledgement of the elective 
nature of affinity as far as any person acquainted with 
chemical operations could contend for it for it must 
be allowed by all that solubility and other collateral cir 
cumstances influence the course of chemical combina 
tions since they determine whether or not there shall 
take place that contact of elements without which affinity 
cannot possibly operate 

 affinity is definite as to quantity in proportion 
as chemists obtained a clearer view of the products of the 
laboratory as results of the composition of elements 
they saw more and more clearly that these results were 
definite that one element not only preferred to combine 
with another of a certain kind but also would combine 
with it to a certain extent and no further thus giving to 
the result not an accidental and variable but a fixed and 
constant character thus salts being considered as the 
result of the combination of two opposite principles acid 
and alkali and being termed neutral when these prin 
ciples exactly balanced each other rouelle who was 
royal professor at paris in admits of neutral 
salts with excess of acid neutral salts with excess of 



 philosophy of chemistry 

base and perfect neutral salts beaume maintained 
against him that there were no salts except those per 
fectly neutral the other classes being the results of mix 
ture and imperfect combination but this question was 
not adequately treated till chemists made every experi 
ment with the balance in their hands when this was 
done they soon discovered that in each neutral salt the 
proportional weights of the ingredients which composed it 
were always the same this was ascertained by wenzel 
whose doctrine of the affinities of bodies appeared in 
 he not only ascertained that the proportions of 
elements in neutral chemical compounds are definite but 
also that they are reciprocal that is that if a a certain 
weight of a certain acid neutralize m a certain weight of 
a certain base and b a certain weight of a certain other 
acid neutralize n a certain weight of a certain other base 
the compound of a and n will also be neutral as also that 
of b and m the same views were again presented by 
richter in in his principles of the measure of che 
mical elements and along with these facts that of the 
combination of elements in multiple proportions being 
also taken into account the foundations of the atomic 
theory were laid and that theory was propounded in 
 by mr dalton that theory however rests upon 
the idea of substance as well as upon that idea of chemi 
cal affinity which we are here considering and the dis 
cussion of its evidence and truth must be for the present 
deferred 

 the two principles just explained that affinity is 
definite as to the kind and as to the quantity of the ele 
ments which it unites have here been stated as results of 
experimental investigation that they could never have 
been clearly understood and therefore never firmly esta 
blished without laborious and exact experiments is 

 dumas pml chim p 



idea of chemical affinity 

certain but yet we may venture to say that being once 
known they possess an evidence beyond that of mere 
experiment for how in fact can we conceive combi 
nations otherwise than as definite in kind and quantity 
if we were to suppose each element ready to combine 
with any other indifferently and indifferently in any 
quantity we should have a w r orld in which all would be 
confusion and indefiniteness there would be no fixed 
kinds of bodies salts and stones and ores would ap 
proach to and graduate into each other by insensible de 
grees instead of this we know that the world consists 
of bodies distinguishable from each other by definite dif 
ferences capable of being classified and named and of 
having general propositions asserted concerning them 
and as we cannot conceive a world in which this should 
not be the case it would appear that we cannot conceive 
a state of things in which the laws of the combination 
of elements should not be of that definite and measured 
kind which we have above asserted 

this will perhaps appear more clearly by stating our 
fundamental convictions respecting chemical composition 
in another form which i shall therefore proceed to do 

 chemical composition determines physical proper 
ties however obscure and incomplete may be our con 
ception of the internal powers by which the ultimate 
particles of bodies are held together it involves at least 
this conviction that these powers are what determine 
bodies to be bodies and therefore contain the reason of all 
the properties which as bodies they possess the forces 
by which the particles of a body are held together also 
cause it to be hard or soft heavy or light opake or trans 
parent black or red for if these forces are not the 
cause of these peculiarities what can be the cause by 
the very supposition which we make respecting these 
forces they include all the relations by which the parts 
vol i c 



 philosophy of chemistry 

are combined into a whole and therefore they and they 
only must determine all the attributes of the whole 
the foundation of all our speculations respecting the 
intimate constitution of bodies must be this that their 
composition determines their properties 

accordingly we find our chemists reasoning from this 
principle with great confidence even in doubtful cases 
thus davy in his researches concerning the diamond 
says that some chemical difference must exist between 
the hardest and most beautiful of the gems and charcoal 
between a nonconductor and a conductor of electricity 
it is scarcely possible to doubt and it seems reasonable to 
expect that a very refined or perfect chemistry will confirm 
the analogies of nature and show that bodies cannot be 
the same in their composition or chemical nature and 
yet totally different in their chemical properties it is 
obvious that the principle here assumed is so far from 
being a mere result of experience that it is here appealed 
to to prove that all previous results of experience on this 
subject must be incomplete and inaccurate and that 
there must be some chemical difference between charcoal 
and diamond though none had hitherto been detected 

 in what manner according to what rule the 
chemical composition shall determine the kind of the sub 
stance we cannot reasonably expect to determine by mere 
conjecture or assumption without a studious examination 
of natural bodies and artificial compounds yet even in 
the most recent times and among men of science we find 
that an assumption of the most arbitrary character has 
in one case been mixed up with this indisputable principle 
that the elementary composition determines the kind of 
the substance in the classification of minerals one 
school of mineralogists have rightly taken it as their fun 
damental principle that the chemical composition shall 
decide the position of the mineral in the system but 



idea of chemical affinity 

they have appended to this principle arbitrarily and 
unjustifiably the maxim that the element which is largest 
in quantity shall fix the class of the substance to make 
such an assumption is to renounce at once all hope of 
framing a system which shall be governed by the resem 
blances of the things classified for how can we possibly 
know beforehand that fiftyfive per cent of iron shall 
give a substance its predominant properties and that 
fortyfive per cent shall not accordingly the systems 
of mineralogical arrangement which have been attempted 
in this way those of haiiy phillips and others have 
been found inconsistent with themselves ambiguous and 
incapable of leading to any general truths 

 thus the physical properties of bodies depend 
upon their chemical composition but in a manner which 
a general examination of bodies with reference to their 
properties and their composition can alone determine 
we may however venture to assert further that the 
more definite the properties are the more distinct may 
we expect to find this dependence now the most 
definite of the properties of bodies are those constant 
properties which involve relations of space that is their 
figure we speak not however of that external figure 
derived from external circumstances which so far from 
being constant and definite is altogether casual and arbi 
trary but of that figure which arises from their internal 
texture and which shows itself not only in the regular 
forms which they spontaneously assume but in the 
disposition of the parts to separate in definite directions 
and no others in short the most definite of the pro 
perties of perfect chemical compounds is their crystalline 
structure and therefore it is evident that the crystalline 
structure of each body and the forms which it affects 
must be in a most intimate dependence upon its chemical 
composition 

 c 



 philosophy of chemistry 

here again we are led to the brink of another theory 
that of crystalline structure which has excited great 
interest among philosophers ever since the time of 
haiiy but this theory involves besides that idea of 
chemical composition with which we are here concerned 
other conceptions which enter into the relations of 
figure these conceptions governed principally by the 
idea of symmetry must be unfolded and examined before 
we can venture to discuss any theory of crystallization 
and we shall proceed to do this as soon as we have 
first duly considered the idea of substance and its con 
sequences 



chapter iii 
of the idea of substance 

 axiom of the indestructibility of substance we 
now come to an idea of which the history is very different 
from those of which we have lately been speaking 
instead of being gradually and recently brought into a 
clear light as has been the case with the ideas of polarity 
and affinity the idea of substance has been entertained 
in a distinct form from the first periods of european 
speculation that this is so is proved by our finding a 
principle depending upon this idea current as an axiom 
among the early philosophers of greece namely that 
nothing can be produced out of nothing such an axiom 
more fully stated amounts to this that the substance of 
which a body consists is incapable of being diminished 
and consequently incapable of being augmented in 
quantity whatever apparent changes it may undergo 
its form its distribution its qualities may vary but the 
substance itself is identically the same under all these 
variations 



idea of substance 

the axiom just spoken of was the great principle of 
the physical philosophy of the epicurean school as it 
must be of every merely material philosophy the 
reader of lucretius will recollect the emphasis with 
which it is repeatedly asserted in his poem 

e nilo nil gigni in niluin nil posse reverti 
nought comes of nought nor ought returns to nought 

those who engaged in these early attempts at physical 
speculation were naturally much pleased with the clear 
ness which was given to their notions of change compo 
sition and decomposition by keeping steadily hold of the 
idea of substance as marked by this fundamental axiom 
nor has its authority ever ceased to be acknowledged 
a philosopher was asked what is the weight of smoke 
he answered subtract the weight of the ashes from the 
weight of the wood which is burnt and you have the 
weight of the smoke this reply would be assented to 
by all and it assumes as incontestable that even under 
the action of fire the material the substance does not 
perish but only changes its form 

this principle of the indestructibility of substance 
might easily be traced in many reasonings and researches 
ancient and modern for instance when the chemist 
works with the retort he places the body on which he 
operates in one part of an inclosed cavity which by its 
bendings and communications separates at the same 
time that it confines the products which result from 
the action of fire and he assumes that this process 
is an analysis of the body into its ingredients not a 
creation of anything which did not exist before or a 
destruction of anything which previously existed and 
he assumes further that the total quantity of the sub 
stance thus analysed is the sum of the quantities of its 
ingredients this principle is the very basis of chemical 
speculation as we shall hereafter explain more fully 
 kant kritik kr r f p 



 philosophy of chemistry 

 the idea of substance the axiom above spoken 
of depends upon the idea of substance which is involved 
in all our views of external objects we unavoidably 
assume that the qualities and properties which we observe 
are properties of things that the adjective implies a 
substantive that there is besides the external characters 
of things something of which they are the characters 
an apple which is red and round and hard is not merely 
redness and roundness and hardness these circum 
stances may all alter while the apple remains the same 
apple behind the appearances which we see we con 
ceive something of which we think or to use the 
metaphor which obtained currency among the ancient 
philosophers the attributes and qualities which we observe 
are supported by and inherent in something and this 
something is hence called a substratum or substance that 
which stands beneath the apparent qualities and supports 
them 

that we have such an idea using the term in the 
sense in which i have employed it throughout these 
disquisitions is evident from what has been already said 
the axiom of the indestructibility of substance proves 
the existence of the idea of substance just as the axioms 
of geometry and arithmetic prove the existence of the 
ideas of space and number in the case of substance 
as of space or number the ideas cannot be said to be 
borrowed from experience for the axioms have an 
authority of a far more comprehensive and demonstrative 
character than any which experience can bestow the 
axiom that nothing can be produced from nothing and 
nothing destroyed is so far from being a result of expe 
rience that it is apparently contradicted by the most 
obvious observation it has at first the air of a paradox 
and by those who refer to it it is familiarly employed to 
show how fallacious common observation is the asser 



idea of substance 

tion is usually made in this form that nothing is created 
and nothing annihilated notwithstanding that the common 
course of our experience appears to show the contrary 
the principle is not an empirical but a necessary and 
universal truth is collected not from the evidence of 
our senses but from the operation of our ideas and 
thus the universal and undisputed authority of the axiom 
proves the existence of the idea of substance 

 lockers denial of the idea of substance i shall 
not attempt to review the various opinions which have 
been promulgated respecting this idea but it may be 
worth our while to notice briefly the part it played in 
the great controversy concerning the origin of our ideas 
which lockes essay occasioned lockes object was to 
disprove the existence of all ideas not derived from 
sensation or reflection and since the idea of substance 
as distinct from external qualities is manifestly not derived 
directly from sensation nor by any very obvious or dis 
tinct process from reflection locke was disposed to 
exclude the idea as much as possible accordingly in 
his argumentation against innate ideas he says plainly 
 the idea of substance which we neither have nor can 
have by sensation or reflection and the inference 
which he draws is that we have no such clear idea at 
all what then it may be asked do we mean by the 
word substance this also he answers though some 
what strangely we signify nothing by the word 
substance but only an uncertain supposition of we know 
not what i e of something whereof we have no par 
ticular distinct positive idea which we take to be the 
substratum or support of those ideas we know that 
while he indulged in this tautological assertion of our 
ignorance and uncertainty he should still have been 
compelled to acknowledge that the word substance had 

 essay b i ch s 



 philosophy of chemistry 

some meaning and should have been driven to explain it 
by the identical metaphors of substratum and support is 
a curious proof how impossible it is entirely to reject this 
idea 

but as we have already seen the supposition of the 
existence of substance is so far from being uncertain that 
it carries with it irresistible conviction and substance is 
necessarily conceived as something which cannot be pro 
duced or destroyed it may be easily supposed therefore 
that when the controversy between locke and his assail 
ants came to this point he would be in some difficulty 
and indeed though with his accustomed skill in contro 
versy he managed to retain a triumphant tone he was 
driven from his main points thus he repels the charge 
that he took the being of substance to be doubtful 
he says having everywhere affirmed and built upon it 
that man is a substance i cannot be supposed to question 
or doubt of the being of substance till i can question or 
doubt of my own being he attempts to make a stand 
by saying that being of things does not depend upon our 
ideas but if he had been asked how without having an 
idea of substance he knew substance to be it is difficult 
to conceive what answer he could have made again he 
had said that our idea of substance arises from our 
accustoming ourselves to suppose a substratum of qua 
lities upon this his adversary bishop stillingfleet very 
properly asks is this custom grounded upon true reason 
or no to which locke replies that it is grounded upon 
this that we cannot conceive how simple ideas of sensible 
qualities should subsist alone and therefore we suppose 
them to exist in and to be supported by some common 
subject which support we denote by the name substance 
thus he allows not only that we necessarily assume the 
reality of substance but that we cannot conceive qualities 
 essay b ii ch and first letter to the bishop of worcester 



idea of substance 

without substance which are concessions so ample as 
almost to include all that any advocate for the idea of 
substance need desire 

perhaps locke and the adherents of locke in deny 
ing that we have an idea of substance in general were 
latently influenced by finding that they could not by any 
effort of mind call up any image winch could be con 
sidered as an image of substance in general that in 
this sense we have no idea of substance is plain enough 
but in the same sense we have no idea of space in 
general or of time or number or cause or resemblance 
yet we certainly have such a power of representing to 
our minds space time number cause resemblance as to 
arrive at numerous truths by means of such representa 
tions these general representations i have all along 
called ideas nor can i discover any more appropriate 
word and in this sense we have also as has now been 
shown an idea of substance 

 is all material substance heavy the principle 
that the quantity of the substance of any body remains 
unchanged by our operations upon it is as we have said 
of universal validity but then the question occurs how 
are we to ascertain the quantity of substance and thus 
to apply the principle in particular cases in the case 
above mentioned where smoke was to be weighed it 
was manifestly assumed that the quantity of the substance 
might be known by its weight and that the total 
quantity being unchanged the total weight also would 
remain the same now on what grounds do we make 
this assumption is all material substance heavy and 
if we can assert this to be so on what grounds does the 
truth of the assertion rest these are not idle questions 
of barren curiosity for in the history of that science 
chemistry to which the idea of substance is principally 
applicable nothing less than the fate of a comprehensive 



 philosophy of chemistry 

and long established theory the phlogiston theory 
depended upon the decision of this question when it 
was urged that the reduction of a metal from a calcined 
to a metallic form could not consist in the addition of 
phlogiston because the metal was lighter than the calx 
had been it was replied by some that this was not con 
clusive for that phlogiston was a principle of levity 
diminishing the weight of the body to which it was 
added this reply was however rejected by all the 
sounder philosophers and the force of the argument 
finally acknowledged but why was this suggestion of a 
substance having no weight or having absolute levity 
repudiated by the most reflective reasoners it is as 
sumed it appears that all matter must be heavy what is 
the ground of this assumption 

the ground of such an assumption appears to be the 
following our idea of substance includes in it this 
that substance is a quantity capable of addition and 
thus capable of making up by composition a sum equal 
to all its parts but substance and the quantity of sub 
stance can be known to us only by its attributes and qua 
lities and the qualities which are capable constantly 
and indefinitely of increase and diminution by increase 
and diminution of the parts must be conceived insepa 
rable from the substance for the qualities if removable 
from the substance at all must be removable by some 
operation performed upon the substance and by the 
idea of substance all such operations are only equivalent 
to separation junction and union of parts hence those 
characters which thus universally increase and diminish 
by addition and subtraction of the things themselves 
belong to the substance of the things they are measures 
of quantity and not merely separable qualities 

the weight of bodies is such a character however 
we compound or divide bodies we compound and divide 



idea of substance 

their weight in the same manner we may dismember a 
body into the minutest parts but the sum of the weights 
of the parts is always equal to the whole weight of the 
body the weight of a body can be in no way increased 
or diminished except by adding something to it or taking 
something from it if we bake a brick we do not con 
ceive that the change of colour or of hardness implies 
that anything has been created or destroyed it may 
easily be that the parts have only assumed a new 
arrangement but if the brick have lost weight we sup 
pose that something moisture for instance has been 
removed elsewhere 

thus weight is apprehended as essential to matter 
in considering the dismemberment or analysis of bodies 
we assume that there must be some criterion of the quan 
tity of substance and this criterion can possess no other 
properties than their weight possesses if we assume 
an element which has no weight or the weight of 
which is negative as some of the defenders of phlo 
giston attempted to do we put an end to all speculation 
on such subjects for if weight is not the criterion of 
the quantity of one element phlogiston for instance why 
is weight the criterion of the quantity of any other ele 
ment we may by the same right assume any other 
real or imaginary element to have levity instead of gra 
vity or to have a peculiar intensity of gravity which 
makes its weight no index of its quantity in short if 
we do this we deprive of all possibility of application our 
notions of element analysis and composition and vio 
late the postulates on which the questions are propounded 
which we thus attempt to decide 

we must then take a constant and quantitative pro 
perty of matter such as weight is to be an index of the 
quantity of matter or of substance to which it belongs 
i do not here speak of the question which has sometimes 



 philosophy of chemistry 

been proposed whether the iveight or the inertia of 
bodies be the more proper measure of the quantity of 
matter for the measure of inertia is regulated by the 
same assumption as that of substance that the quantity 
of the whole must be equal to the quantity of all the 
parts and inertia is measured by weight for the same 
reason that substance is so 

having thus established the certainty and ascertained 
the interpretation of the fundamental principle which the 
idea of substance involves we are prepared to consider 
its application in the science upon which it has a peculiar 
bearing 



chapter iv 

application of the idea of substance in 
chemistry 

 a body is equal to the sum of its elements 
from the earliest periods of chemistry the balance has 
been familiarly used to determine the proportions of the 
ingredients and of the compound and soon after the 
middle of the last century this practice was so studiously 
followed that wenzel and richter were thereby led to 
the doctrine of definite proportions but yet the full 
value and significance of the balance as an indispensable 
instrument in chemical researches was not understood till 
the gaseous as well as solid and fluid ingredients were 
taken into the account when this was done it was 
found that the principle that the whole is equal to the 
sum of its parts of which as we have seen the necessary 
truth in such cases flows from the idea of substance 
could be applied in the most rigorous manner and con 
versely it was found that by the use of the balance the 
chemist could decide in doubtful cases which was a 
whole and which were parts 



application of the idea of substance 

for it may be observed that chemistry considers all 
the changes which belong to her province as compositions 
and decompositions of elements but still the question 
may occur whether an observed change be the one or 
the other how can we distinguish whether the process 
which we contemplate be composition or decomposition 
whether the new body be formed by addition of a new 
or subtraction of an old element again in the case of 
decomposition we may inquire what are the ultimate 
limits of our analysis if we decompound bodies into 
others more and more simple how far can we carry this 
succession of processes how far can we proceed in the 
road of analysis and in our actual course what evidence 
have we that our progress as far as it has gone has carried 
us from the more complex to the more simple to this we 
reply that the criterion which enables us to distinguish 
decidedly and finally whether our process have been a 
mere analysis of the proposed body into its ingredients or 
a synthesis of some of them with some new element is 
the principle stated above that the weight of the whole is 
equal to the weight of all the parts and no process of 
chemical analysis or synthesis can be considered complete 
till it has been verified by this fact by finding that the 
weight of the compound is the weight of its supposed in 
gredients or that if there be an element which we think 
we have detached from the whole its loss is betrayed by a 
corresponding diminution of weight 

i have already noticed what an important part this 
principle has played in the great chemical controversy 
which ended in the establishment of the oxygen theory 
the calcination of a metal was decided to be the union 
of oxygen with the metal and not the separation of 
phlogiston from it because it was found that in the pro 
cess of calcination the weight of the metal increased 
and increased exactly as much as the weight of ambient 



 philosophy of chemistry 

air diminished when oxygen and hydrogen were ex 
ploded together and a small quantity of water was pro 
duced it was held that this was really a synthesis of 
water because when very great care was taken with the 
process the weight of the water which resulted was equal 
to the weight of the gases which disappeared 

 lavoisier it was when gases came to be con 
sidered as entering largely into the composition of liquid 
and solid bodies that extreme accuracy in weighing was 
seen to be so necessary to the true understanding of 
chemical processes it was in this manner discovered by 
lavoisier and his contemporaries that oxygen constitutes 
a large ingredient of calcined metals of acids and of 
water a countryman of lavoisier has not only given 
most just praise to that great philosopher for having con 
stantly tested all his processes by a careful and skilful use 
of the balance but has also claimed for him the merit of 
having introduced the maxim that in chemical operations 
nothing is created and nothing lost but i think it is 
impossible to deny that this maxim is assumed in all the 
attempts at analysis made by his contemporaries as well 
as by him this maxim is indeed included in any clear 
notion of analysis it could not be the result of the 
researches of any one chemist but was the governing 
principle of the reasonings of all lavoisier however 
employed this principle with peculiar assiduity and skill 
in applying it he does not confine himself to mere addi 
tions and subtractions of the quantities of ingredients 
but often obtains his results by more complex processes 
in one of his investigations he says i may consider the 
ingredients which are brought together and the result 
which is obtained as an algebraical equation and if i 
successively suppose each of the quantities of this equation 
to be unknown i can obtain its value from the rest and 

 m dumas leqonsch la philosophic chimiqw p 



application of the idea of substance 

thus i can rectify the experiment by the calculation and 
the calculation by the experiment i have often taken 
advantage of this method in order to correct the first 
results of my experiments and to direct me in repeating 
them with proper precautions 

the maxim that the whole is equal to the sum of all 
its parts is thus capable of most important and varied 
employment in chemistry but it may be applied in 
another form to the exclusion of a class of speculations 
which are often put forwards 

 maxim respecting imponderable elements several 
of the phenomena which belong to bodies as heat light 
electricity magnetism have been explained hypothetical ly 
by assuming the existence of certain fluids but these fluids 
have never been shown to have weight hence such 
hypothetical fluids have been termed imponderable elements 
it is however plain that so long as these fluids appear 
to be without weight they are not elements of bodies in 
the same sense as those elements of which we have 
hitherto been speaking indeed we may with good 
reason doubt whether those phenomena depend upon 
transferable fluids at all we have seen strong reason 
to believe that light is not matter but only motion and 
the same thing appears to be probable with regard to 
heat nor is it at all inconceivable that a similar hypo 
thesis respecting electricity and magnetism should here 
after be found tenable now if heat light and those 
other agents be not matter they are not elements in 
such a sense as to be included in the principle referred 
to above that the body is equal to the sum of its ele 
ments consequently the maxim just stated that in 
chemical operations nothing is created nothing annihi 
lated does not apply to light and heat they are not 
things and whether heat can be produced where there 
was no heat before and light struck out from darkness 



 philosophy of chemistry 

the ideas of which we are at present treating do not 
enable us to say in reasoning respecting chemical 
synthesis and analysis therefore we shall only make con 
fusion by attempting to include in our conception the 
light and heat which are produced and destroyed such 
phenomena may be very proper subjects of study as 
indeed they undoubtedly are but they cannot be studied 
to advantage by considering them as sharing the nature 
of composition and decomposition 

again in all attempts to explain the processes of 
nature the proper course is first to measure the facts 
with precision and then to endeavour to understand 
their cause now the facts of chemical composition and 
decomposition the weights of the ingredients and of the 
compounds are facts measurable with the utmost preci 
sion and certainty but it is far otherwise with the light 
and heat which accompany chemical processes when 
combustion deflagration explosion takes place how can 
we measure the light or the heat even in cases of 
more tranquil action though we can apply the thermo 
meter what does the thermometer tell us respecting the 
quantity of the heat since then we have no measure 
which is of any value as regards such circumstances in 
chemical changes if we attempt to account for these 
phenomena on chemical principles we introduce into 
investigations in themselves perfectly precise and mathe 
matically rigorous another class of reasonings vague 
and insecure of which the only possible effect is to vitiate 
the whole reasoning and to make our conclusions ine 
vitably erroneous 

we are led then to this maxim that imponderable 
fluids are not to be admitted as chemical elements of bodies 

 since we are thus warned by a sound view of the nature of 
science from considering chemical affinity as having any hold upon 
imponderable elements we are manifestly still more decisively pro 



application of the idea of substance 

 it appears i think that our best and most philo 
sophical chemists have proceeded upon this principle in 
their investigations in reasoning concerning the consti 
tution of bodies and the interpretation of chemical changes 
the attempts to include in these interpretations the heat 
or cold produced by the addition or subtraction of a 
certain hypothetical caloric have become more and more 
rare among men of science such statements and the 
explanations often put forwards of the light and heat 
which appear under various circumstances in the form of 
fire must be considered as unessential parts of any sound 
theory accordingly we find mr faraday gradually 
relinquishing such views in january he speaks 
generally of an hypothesis of this kind i cannot 
refrain from recalling here the beautiful idea put forth 
i believe by berzelius in his developement of his views 
of the electrochemical theory of affinity that the heat 
and light evolved during cases of powerful combination 
are the consequence of the electric discharge which is at 
that moment taking place but in april of the same 
yearf he observes that in the combination of oxygen 
and hydrogen to produce water electric powers to a most 
enormous amount are for the time active but that the 
flame which is produced gives but feeble traces of such 
powers such phenomena therefore he adds may 
not cannot be taken as evidences of the nature of the 
action but are merely incidental results incomparably 
small in relation to the forces concerned and supplying 
no information of the way in which the particles are 

hibited from supposing mechanical impulse or pressure to have any 
effect upon such elements to make this supposition is to connect 
the most subtle and incorporeal objects which we know in nature by 
the most material ties this remark seems to be applicable to m 
poissons hypothesis that the electric fluid is retained at the surface of 
bodies by the pressure of the atmosphere

active on each other or in which their forces are finally 
arranged 

in pursuance of this maxim we must consider as 
unessential parts of the oxygen theory that portion of it 
much insisted upon by its author at the time in which 
when sulphur for instance combined with oxygen to 
produce sulphuric acid the combustion was accounted 
for by means of the caloric which was supposed to bo 
liberated from its combination with oxygen 

 controversy of the composition of water there 
is another controversy of our times to which we may 
witli great propriety apply the maxim now before us 
after the glory of having first given a true view of the 
composition of water had long rested tranquilly upon 
the names of cavendish and lavoisier a claim was 
made in favour of james watt as the real author of this 
discovery by his son mr j watt and his eulogist 
m arago it is not to our purpose here to discuss 
the various questions which have arisen on this subject 
respecting priority of publication and respecting the 
translation of opinions published at one time into the 
language of another period but if we look at watts 
own statement of his views given soon after those of 
cavendish had been published we shall perceive that 
it is marked by a violation of this maxim we shall 
find that he does admit imponderable fluids as chemical 
elements and thus shows a great vagueness and 
confusion in his idea of chemical composition with 
such imperfection in his views it is not surprising that 
watt not only did not anticipate but did not fully 
appreciate the discovery of cavendish and lavoisier 
watts statement of his views is as followsf are we 
not authorized to conclude that water is composed of

application op the idea of substance 

dephlogisticated air and phlogiston deprived of part of 
their latent or elementary heat that dephlogisticated or 
pure air is composed of water deprived of its phlogiston 
and united to elementary heat and light and that the 
latter are contained in it in a latent state so as not to 
be sensible to the thermometer or to the eye and if 
light be only a modification of heat or a circumstance 
attending it or a component part of the inflammable air 
then pure or dephlogisticated air is composed of water 
deprived of its phlogiston and united to elementary heat 

when we compare this doubtful and hypothetical 
statement involving so much that is extraneous and hete 
rogeneous with the conclusion of cavendish in which 
there is nothing hypothetical or superfluous we may con 
fidently assent to the decision which has been pronounced 
by one of our own time in favour of cavendish and 
we may with pleasure recognise in this enlightened um 
pire a due appreciation of the value of the maxim on 
which we are now insisting cavendish says mr 
vernon harcourt pared off from the hypotheses their 
theories of combustion and affinities of imponderable for 
ponderable matter as complicating chemical with physical 
considerations 

 relation of heat to chemistry but while we 
thus condemn the attempts to explain the thermotical 
phenomena of chemical processes by means of che 
mical considerations it may be asked if we are alto 
gether to renounce the hope of understanding such 
phenomena it is plain it may be said that heat gene 
rated in chemical changes is always a very important 
circumstance and can sometimes be measured and per 
haps reduced to laws are we prohibited from speculat 
ing concerning the causes of such circumstances and 

 the rev w vernon harcourt address to the british asso

such laws and to this we reply that we may properly 
attempt to connect chemical with thermotical processes 
so far as we have obtained a clear and probable view of 
the nature of the thermotical processes when our 
theory of thermotics is tolerably complete and certain 
we may with propriety undertake to connect it with our 
theory of chemistry but at present we are not far 
enough advanced in our knowledge of heat to make this 
attempt with any hope of success we can hardly 
expect to understand the part which heat plays in the 
union of two bodies when we cannot as yet compre 
hend in what manner it produces the liquefaction or 
vaporization of one body we cannot look to account 
for gay lussac and daltons law that all gases expand 
equally by heat till we learn how heat causes a gas to 
expand we cannot hope to see the grounds of dulong 
and petits law that the specific heat of all atoms is 
the same till we know much more not only about atoms 
but about specific heat we have as yet no thermotical 
theory which even professes to account for all the pro 
minent facts of the subject and the theories which 
have been proposed are of the most diverse kind 
laplace assumes particles of bodies surrounded by 
atmospheres of caloric f cauchy makes heat consist in 
longitudinal vibrations of the ether of which transverse 
vibrations produce light in amperes theory f heat 
consists in the vibrations of the particles of bodies 
and so long as we have nothing more certain in our 
conceptions of heat than the alternative of these and 
other precarious hypotheses how can we expect to arrive 
at any real knowledge by connecting the results of such 
hypotheses with the speculations of chemistry of which 
science the theory is at least equally obscure

application of the idea of substance 

the largest attempts at chemical theory have been 
made in the form of the atomic theory to which i have 
just had occasion to allude i must therefore before 
quitting the subject say a few words respecting this 
theory 



chapter v 
the atomic theory 

 the atomic theory considered on chemical 
grounds we have already seen that the combinations 
which result from chemical affinity are definite a certain 
quantity of one ingredient uniting not with an uncertain 
but with a certain quantity of another ingredient but 
it was found in addition to this principle that one ingre 
dient would often unite with another in different propor 
tions and that in such cases these proportions are mul 
tiples one of another in the three salts formed by 
potassa with oxalic acid the quantities of acid which 
combine with the same quantity of alkali are exactly in 
the proportion of the numbers and the same 
rule of the existence of multiple proportions is found to 
obtain in other cases 

it is obvious that such results will be accounted for 
if we suppose the base and the acid to consist each of 
definite equal particles and that the formation of the 
salts above mentioned consists in the combination of one 
particle of the base with one particle of acid with two 
particles of acid and with four particles of acid respec 
tively but further as we have already stated chemical 
affinity is not only definite but reciprocal the propor 
tions of potassa and soda which form neutral salts are 
 and in one case and therefore in all these 



 philosophy of chemistry 

numbers represent the proportions of weight in which the 
two bases potassa and soda enter into analogous combi 
nations of potassa is equivalent to of soda 
these facts with regard to combination are still expressed 
by the above supposition of equal particles assuming 
that the weights of a particle of potassa and of soda are 
in the proportion of to 

but we pursue our analysis further we find that 
potassa is a compound of a metallic base potassium 
and of oxygen in the proportion of to we sup 
pose then that the particle of potassa consists of a par 
ticle of potassium and a particle of oxygen and these 
latter particles since we see no present need to suppose 
them divided potassium and oxygen being simple bodies 
we may call atoms and assume to be indivisible and 
by supposing all simple bodies to consist of such atoms 
and compounds to be formed by the union of two or 
three or more of such atoms we explain the occurrence 
of definite and multiple proportions and we construct the 
atomic theory 

 hypothesis of atoms so far as the assumption 
of such atoms as we have spoken of serves to express 
those laws of chemical composition which we have 
referred to it is a clear and useful generalization 
but if the atomic theory be put forwards and its 
author dr dalton appears to have put it forwards 
with such an intention as asserting that chemical 
elements are really composed of atoms that is of such 
particles not further divisible we cannot avoid remark 
ing that for such a conclusion chemical research has 
not afforded nor can afford any satisfactory evidence 
whatever the smallest observable quantities of ingre 
dients as well as the largest combine according to the 
laws of proportions and equivalence which have been 
cited above how are we to deduce from such facts any 



the atomic theory 

inference with regard to the existence of certain smallest 
possible particles the theory when dogmatically 
taught as a physical truth asserts that all observable 
quantities of elements are composed of proportional 
numbers of particles which can no further be subdivided 
but all which observation teaches us is that if there be 
such particles they are smaller than the smallest observ 
able quantities in chemical experiment at least there 
is not the slightest positive evidence for the existence of 
such atoms the assumption of indivisible particles 
smaller than the smallest observable which combine par 
ticle with particle will explain the phenomena but the 
assumption of particles bearing this proportion but not 
possessing the property of indivisibility will explain the 
phenomena at least equally well the decision of the 
question therefore whether the atomic hypothesis be 
the proper way of conceiving the chemical combinations 
of substances must depend not upon chemical facts but 
upon our conception of substance in this sense the 
question is an ancient and curious controversy and we 
shall hereafter have to make some remarks upon it 

 chemical difficulties of the hypothesis but 
before doing this we may observe that there is no 
small difficulty in reconciling this hypothesis with the 
facts of chemistry according to the theory all salts 
compounded of an acid and a base are analogous in their 
atomic constitution and the number of atoms in one 
such compound being known or assumed the number of 
atoms in other salts may be determined but when we 
proceed in this course of reasoning to other bodies as 
metals we find ourselves involved in difficulties the 
protoxide of iron is a base which according to all ana 
logy must consist of one atom of iron and one of oxygen 
but the peroxide of iron is also a base and it appears by 
the analysis of this substance that it must consist of two 



 philosophy of chemistry 

thirds of an atom of iron and one atom of oxygen 
here then our indivisible atoms must be divisible even 
upon chemical grounds and if we attempt to evade 
this difficulty by making the peroxide of iron consist of 
two atoms of iron and three of oxygen we have to make 
a corresponding alteration in the theoretical constitution of 
all bodies analogous to the protoxide and thus we over 
turn the very foundation of the theory chemical facts 
therefore not only do not prove the atomic theory as 
a physical truth but they are not according to any modi 
fication yet devised of the theory reconcilable with its 
scheme 

nearly the same conclusions result from the attempts 
to employ the atomic hypothesis in expressing another 
important chemical law the law of the combinations 
of gases according to definite proportions of their volumes 
experimentally established by guy lussac in order 
to account for this law it has been very plausibly sug 
gested that all gases under the same pressure contain 
an equal number of atoms in the same space and that 
when they combine they unite atom to atom thus one 
volume of chlorine unites with one volume of hydrogen 
and form hydrochloric acid f but then this hydro 
chloric acid occupies the space of the two volumes and 
therefore the proper number of particles cannot be sup 
plied and the uniform distribution of atoms in all gases 
maintained without dividing into two each of the com 
pound particles constituted of an atom of chlorine and 
an atom of hydrogen and thus in this case also the 
atomic theory becomes untenable if it be understood to 
imply the indivisibility of the atoms 

in all these attempts to obtain a distinct physical 
conception of chemical union by the aid of the atomic 
hypothesis the atoms are conceived to be associated by 

 hist ind sc iii t dumas phil chim 



the atomic theory 

certain forces of the nature of mechanical attractions 
but we have already seen that no such mode of con 
ception can at all explain or express the facts of che 
mical combination and therefore it is not wonderful that 
when the atomic theory attempts to give an account of 
chemical relations by contemplating them under such 
an aspect the facts on which it grounds itself should be 
found not to authorise its positive doctrines and that 
when these doctrines are tried upon the general range 
of chemical observation they should prove incapable of 
even expressing without selfcontradiction the laws of 
phenomena 

 grounds of the atomic doctrine yet the doctrine 
of atoms or of substance as composed of indivisible 
particles has in all ages had great hold upon the minds 
of physical speculators nor would this doctrine ever 
have suggested itself so readily or have been maintained 
so tenaciously as the true mode of conceiving chemical 
combinations if it had not been already familiar to the 
minds of those wiio endeavour to obtain a general view 
of the constitution of nature the grounds of the assump 
tion of the atomic structure of substance are to be found 
rather in the idea of substance itself than in the experi 
mental laws of chemical affinity and the question of 
the existence of atoms thus depending upon an idea 
which has been the subject of contemplation from the 
very infancy of philosophy has been discussed in all ages 
with interest and ingenuity on this very account it is 
unlikely that the question so far as it bears upon che 
mistry should admit of any clear and final solution still 
it will be instructive to look back at some of the opinions 
which have been delivered respecting this doctrine 

 ancient prevalence of the atomic doctrine the 
doctrine that matter consists of minute simple indivisible 

 see chapter i of this book 



 philosophy of chemistry 

indestructible particles as its ultimate elements has been 
current in all ages and countries whenever the tendency 
of man to wide and subtle speculations has been active 
i need not attempt to trace the history of this opinion in 
the schools of greece and italy it was the leading 
feature in the physical tenets of the epicureans and was 
adopted by their roman disciples as the poem of lucre 
tius copiously shows us the same tenet had been held 
at still earlier periods in forms more or less definite by 
other philosophers it is ascribed to democritus and is 
said to have been by him derived from leucippus but 
this doctrine is found also we are told among the 
speculations of another intellectual and acute race the 
hindoos according to some of their philosophical 
writers the ultimate elements of matter are atoms of 
which it is proved by certain reasonings that they are 
each onesixth of one of the motes that float in the 
sunbeam 

this early prevalence of controversies of the widest 
and deepest kind which even in our day remain unde 
cided has in it nothing which need surprise us or at 
least it has in it nothing which is not in conformity with 
the general course of the history of philosophy as soon 
as any ideas are clearly possessed by the human mind its 
activity and acuteness in reasoning upon them are such 
that the fundamental antitheses and ultimate difficul 
ties which belong to them are soon brought into view 
the greek and indian philosophers had mastered com 
pletely the idea of space and possessed the idea of 
substance in tolerable distinctness they were therefore 
quite ready with their lively and subtle minds to discuss 
the question of the finite and infinite divisibility of matter 
so far as it involved only the ideas of space and of sub

stance and this accordingly they did with great ingenuity 
and perseverance 

but the ideas of space and of substance are far from 
being sufficient to enable men to form a complete general 
view of the constitution of matter we must add to 
these ideas that of mechanical force with its antagonist 
resistance and that of the affinity of one kind of matter 
for another now the former of these ideas the ancients 
possessed in a very obscure and confused manner and 
of the latter they had no apprehension whatever they 
made vague assumptions respecting the impact and pres 
sure of atoms on each other but of their mutual attrac 
tion and repulsion they never had any conception except 
of the most dim and wavering kind and of an affinity 
different from mere local union they did not even dream 
their speculations concerning atoms therefore can have 
no value for us except as a part of the history of science 
if their doctrines appear to us to approach near to the 
conclusions of our modern philosophy it must be because 
our modern philosophy has not fully profited by the addi 
tional light which the experiments and meditations of 
later times have thrown upon the constitution of matter 

 bacon still when modern philosophers look upon 
the atomic theory of the ancients in a general point of 
view merely without considering the special conditions 
which such a theory must fulfil in order to represent the 
discoveries of modern times they are disposed to regard 
it with admiration accordingly we find francis bacon 
strongly expressing such a feeling the atomic theory is 
selected and dwelt upon by him as the chain which connects 
the best parts of the physical philosophy of the ancient 
and the modern world among his works is a remarkable 
dissertation on the philosophy of democritiis parmenides 
and telesins the last mentioned of whom was one of 
the revivers of physical science in modern times in 



 philosophy of chemistry 

this work he speaks of the atomic doctrine of democritus 
as a favourable example of the exertions of the undis 
ciplined intellect haec ipsa placita quamvis paulo 
emendatiora talia sunt qualia esse possunt ille quae ab 
intellectu sibi permisso nee continenter et gradatim sub 
levato profecta videntur accordingly he adds the 
doctrine of atoms from its going a step beyond the 
period in which it was advanced was ridiculed by the 
vulgar and severely handled in the disputations of the 
learned notwithstanding the profound acquaintance with 
physical science by which its author was allowed to be 
distinguished and from which he acquired the character 
of a magician 

 however he continues neither the hostility of 
aristotle with all his skill and vigour in disputation 
though like the ottoman sultans he laboured to destroy 
all his brother philosophers that he might rest undis 
puted master of the throne of science nor the majestic 
and lofty authority of plato could effect the subversion 
of the doctrine of democritus and while the opinions 
of plato and aristotle were rehearsed with loud decla 
mation and professorial pomp in the schools this of 
democritus was always held in high honour by those of 
a deeper wisdom who followed in silence a severer path 
of contemplation in the daysof roman speculation it 
kept its ground and its favour cicero everywhere speaks 
of its author with the greatest praise and juvenal who 
like poets in general probably expressed the prevailing 
judgment of his time proclaims his merit as a noble 
exception to the general stupidity of his countrymen 

 cujus prudentia monstrat 
magnos posse viros et magna exempla daturos 
yervecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci 

 the destruction of this philosophy was not effected 
by aristotle and plato but by genseric and attila and 



the atomic theory 

their barbarians for then when human knowledge had 
suffered shipwreck those fragments of the aristotelian 
and platonic philosophy floated on the surface like things 
of some lighter and emptier sort and so were preserved 
while more solid matters went to the bottom and were 
almost lost in oblivion 

 modern prevalence of the atomic doctrine it is 
our business here to consider the doctrine of atoms only 
in its bearing upon existing physical sciences and i must 
therefore abstain from tracing the various manifestations 
of it in the schemes of hypothetical cosmologists its 
place among the vortices of descartes its exhibition in 
the monads of leibnitz i will however quote a passage 
from newton to show the hold it had upon his mind 

at the close of his opticks he says all these things 
being considered it seems probable to me that god in 
the beginning formed matter in solid massy hard 
impenetrable moveable particles of such sizes and 
figures and with such other properties and in such pro 
portions to space as most conduced to the end for which 
he formed them and that these primitive particles 
being solids are incomparably harder than any porous 
bodies compounded of them even so very hard as never 
to wear or break in pieces no ordinary power being able 
to divide what god had made one in the first creation 
while the particles continue entire they may compose 
bodies of one and the same nature and texture in all 
ages but should they wear away or break in pieces the 
nature of things depending on them would be changed 
water and earth composed of old worn particles and 
fragments of particles would not be of the same nature 
and texture now with water and earth composed of entire 
particles in the beginning and therefore that nature 
may be lasting the changes of corporeal things are to be 
placed only in the various separations and new associa 



 philosophy of chemistry 

tions and motions of these permanent particles com 
pounded bodies being apt to break not in the midst of 
solid particles but where those particles are laid together 
and only touch in a few points 

we shall hereafter see how extensively the atomic 
doctrine has prevailed among still more recent philoso 
phers not only have the chemists assumed it as the 
fittest form for exhibiting the principles of multiple pro 
portions but the physical mathematicians as laplace and 
poisson have made it the basis of their theories of heat 
electricity capillary action and the crystallographers 
have been supposed to have established both the exist 
ence and the arrangement of such ultimate molecules 

in the way in which it has been employed by such 
writers the hypothesis of ultimate particles has been of 
great use and is undoubtedly permissible but when we 
would assert this theory not as a convenient hypothesis 
for the expression or calculation of the laws of nature 
but as a philosophical truth respecting the constitution 
of the universe we find ourselves checked by difficulties 
of reasoning which we cannot overcome as w r ell as by 
conflicting phenomena which we cannot reconcile i 
will attempt to state briefly the opposing arguments on 
this question 

 arguments for and against atoms the leading 
arguments on the two sides of the question in their most 
general form may be stated as follows 

for the atomic doctrine the appearances which 
nature presents are compounded of many parts but if we 
go on resolving the larger parts into smaller and so on 
successively we must at last come to something simple 
for that which is compound can be so no otherwise than 
by composition of what is simple and if we suppose all 
composition to be removed which hypothetically we may 
do there can remain nothing but a number of simple 



the atomic theory 

substances capable of composition but themselves not 
compounded that is matter being dissolved resolves 
itself into atoms 

against the atomic doctrine space is divisible 
without limit as may be proved by geometry and matter 
occupies space therefore matter is divisible without limit 
and no portion of matter is indivisible or an atom 

and to the argument on the other side just stated it 
is replied that we cannot even hypothetically divest a body 
of composition if by composition we mean the relation of 
point to point in space however small be a particle it 
is compounded of parts having relation in space 

the atomists urge again that if matter be infinitely 
divisible a finite body consists of an infinite number of 
parts which is a contradiction to this it is replied that 
the finite body consists of an infinite number of parts in 
the same sense in which the parts are infinitely small 
which is no contradiction 

but the opponents of the atomists not only rebut 
but retort this argument drawn from the notion of 
infinity your atoms they say are indivisible by any 
finite force therefore they are infinitely hard and thus 
your finite particles possess infinite properties to this 
the atomists are wont to reply that they do not mean 
the hardness of their particles to be infinite but only so 
great as to resist all usual natural forces but here it is 
plain that their position becomes untenable for in the 
first place their assumption of this precise degree of 
hardness in the particles is altogether gratuitous and in 
the next place if it were granted such particles are not 
atoms since in the next moment the forces of nature 
may be augmented so as to divide the particle though 
hitherto undivided 

such are the arguments for and against the atomic 
theory in its original form but when these atoms are 



 philosophy of chemistry 

conceived as they have been by newton and commonly 
by his followers to be solid hard particles exerting 
attractive and repulsive forces a new set of arguments 
come into play of these the principal one may be thus 
stated according to the atomic theory thus modified 
the properties of bodies depend upon the attractions and 
repulsions of the particles therefore among other pro 
perties of bodies their hardness depends upon such forces 
but if the hardness of the bodies depends upon the forces 
the repulsion for instance of the particles upon what 
does the hardness of the particles depend what progress 
do we make in explaining the properties of bodies when 
we assume the same properties in our explanation and 
to what purpose do we assume that the particles are hard 

 transition to boscovictis theory to this diffi 
culty it does not appear easy to offer any reply but 
if the hardness and solidity of the particles be given 
up as an incongruous and untenable appendage to 
the newtonian view of the atomic theory we are led 
to the theory of boscovich according to which matter 
consists not of solid particles but of mere mathematical 
centres of force according to this theory each body is 
composed of a number of geometrical points from which 
emanate forces following certain mathematical laws in 
virtue of which they become at certain small distances 
attractive at certain other distances repulsive and at 
greater distances attractive again from these forces of 
the points arise the cohesion of the parts of the same 
body the resistance which it exerts against the pressure 
of another body and finally the attraction of gravitation 
which it exerts upon bodies at a distance 

this theory is at least a homogeneous and consistent 
mechanical theory and it is probable that it may be used 
as an instrument for investigating and expressing true 
laws of nature although as we have already said the 



the atomic theory 

attempt to identify the forces by which the particles of 
bodies are bound together with mechanical attraction 
appears to be a confusion of two separate ideas 

 use of the molecular hypothesis in this form 
representing matter as a collection of molecules or 
centres of force the atomic theory has been abundantly 
employed in modern times as an hypothesis on which 
calculations respecting the elementary forces of bodies 
might be conducted when thus employed it is to be 
considered as expressing the principle that the properties 
of bodies depend upon forces emanating from immovable 
points of their mass this view of the way in which the 
properties of bodies are to be treated by the mechanical 
philosopher was introduced by newton and was a natural 
sequel to the success which he had obtained by reasoning 
concerning central forces on a large scale i have 
already quoted his preface to the principia in which he 
says many things induce me to believe that the rest 
of the phenomena of nature as well as those of astro 
nomy may depend upon certain forces by which the 
particles of bodies in virtue of causes not yet known are 
urged towards each other and cohere in regular figures 
or are mutually repelled and recede and philosophers 
knowing nothing of these forces have hitherto failed in 
their examination of nature since the time of newton 
this line of speculation has been followed with great 
assiduity and by some mathematicians with great success 
in particular laplace has shown that it may in many 
instances be made a much closer representation of 
nature if we suppose the forces exerted by the particles 
to deciease so rapidly with the increasing distance from 
them that the force is finite only at distances impercep 
tible to our senses and vanishes at all remoter points 
he has taught the method of expressing and calculating 
such forces and he and other mathematicians of his 
vol i fi

school have applied this method to many of the most 
important questions of physics as capillary action the 
elasticity of solids the conduction and radiation of heat 
the explanation of many apparently unconnected and 
curious observed facts by these mathematical theories gives 
us a strong assurance that its essential principles are true 
but it must be obseived that the actual constitution 
of bodies as composed of distinct and separate particles is 
by no means proved by these coincidences the assump 
tion in the reasoning of certain centres of force acting 
at a distance is to be considered as nothing more than a 
method of reducing to calculation that view of the 
constitution of bodies which supposes that they exert 
force at every point it is a mathematical artifice of the 
same kind as the hypothetical division of a body into 
infinitesimal parts in order to find its centre of gravity 
and no more implies a physical reality than that hypo 
 thesis does 

 poissons inference when therefore m pois 
son in his views of capillary action treats this hypothe 
tical distribution of centres of force as if it were a 
physical fact and blames laplace for not taking account 
of their different distribution at the surface of the fluid 
and below it he appears to push the claims of the 
molecular hypothesis too far the only ground for the 
assumption of separate centres is that we can thus ex 
plain the action of the whole mass the intervals between 
the centres nowhere enter into this explanation and 
therefore we can have no reason for assuming these inter 
vals different in one part of the fluid and in the other 
m poisson asserts that the density of the fluid diminishes 
when we approach very near the surface but he allows 
that this diminution is not detected by experiment and 
that the formula on his supposition so far as the results 

 poisson theorle de i action capillaire 



the atomic theory 

go are identical with those of laplace it is clear then 
that his doctrine consists merely in the assertion of the 
necessary truth of a part of the hypothesis which cannot 
be put to the test of experiment it is true that so long 
as we have before us the hypothesis of separate centres 
the particles very near the surface are not in a condition 
symmetrical with that of the others but it is also true 
that this hypothesis is only a step of calculation there 
results at one period of the process of deduction a 
stratum of smaller density at the surface of the fluid but 
at a succeeding point of the reasoning the thickness of 
this stratum vanishes it has no physical existence 

thus the molecular hypothesis as used in such cases 
does not differ from the doctrine of forces acting at every 
point of the mass and this principle which is common 
to both the opposite views is the true part of each 

 wollastorcs argument an attempt has been 
made in another case but depending on nearly the same 
arguments to bring the doctrine of ultimate atoms to the 
test of observation in the case of the air we know that 
there is a diminution of density in approaching the upper 
surface of the atmosphere if it have a surface but it is 
held by some that except we allow the doctrine of ulte 
nate molecules it will not be bounded by any surface 
but will extend to an infinite distance this is the 
reasoning of wollaston if air consists of any ultimate 
particles no longer divisible then must the expansion of 
the medium composed of them cease at that distance 
where the force of gravity downwards is equal to the 
resistance arising from the repulsive force of the medium 
but if there be no such ultimate particles every stratum 
will require a stratum beyond it to prevent by its weight 
a further expansion and thus the atmosphere must 
extend to an infinite distance and wollaston con

ceived that he could learn from observation whether the 
atmosphere was thus diffused through all space for if so 
it must he argued be accumulated about the larger 
bodies of the system as jupiter and the sun by the law 
of universal gravitation and the existence of an atmo 
sphere about these bodies might he remarked be detected 
by its effects in producing refraction his result is that 
 all the phenomena accord entirely with the supposition 
that the earths atmosphere is of finite extent limited by 
the weight of ultimate atoms of definite magnitude no 
longer divisible by repulsion of their parts 

a very little reflection will show us that such a line 
of reasoning cannot lead to any result for we know 
nothing of the law which connects the density with the 
compressing force in air so extremely rare as we must 
suppose it to be near the boundary of the atmosphere 
now there are possible laws of dependence of the den 
sity upon the compressing force such that the atmosphere 
would terminate in virtue of the law without any assump 
tion of atoms this may be proved by mathematical rea 
soning if we suppose the density of air to be as the 
square root of the compressing force it will follow that at 
the very limits of the atmosphere the strata of equal 
thickness may observe in their densities such a law of 
proportion as is expressed by the numbers 

if it be asked how on this hypothesis the density of 
the highest stratum can be as since there is nothing to 

 for the compressing force on each being as the whole weight 
beyond it will be for the four highest strata and of which 
the square roots are as or as and though these 
numbers are not exactly as the densities those who are 
a little acquainted with mathematical reasoning will see that the dif 
ference arises from taking so small a number of strata if we were to 
make the strata indefinitely thin as to avoid error we ought to do the 
coincidence would be exact and thus according to this law the series 
of strata terminates as we ascend without any consideration of atoms 



the atomic theory 

compress it we answer that the upper part of the highest 
stratum compresses the lower and that the density dimi 
nishes continually to the surface so that the need of 
compression and the compressing weight vanish together 

the fallacy of concluding that because the height of 
the atmosphere is finite the weight of the highest stratum 
must be finite is just the same as the fallacy of those who 
conclude that when we project a body vertically upwards 
because it occupies only a finite time in ascending to the 
highest point the velocity at the last instant of the 
ascent must be finite for it might be said if the last 
velocity of ascent be not finite how can the body describe 
the last particle of space in a finite time and the answer 
is that there is no last finite particle of space and there 
fore no last finite velocity 

 permanence of properties of bodies we nave 
already seen that in explaining the properties of mattei 
as we find them in nature the assumption of solid hard 
indestructible particles is of no use or value but we 
may remark before quitting the subject that newton 
appears to have had another reason for assuming such 
particles and one well worthy of notice he wished to 
express by means of this hypothesis the doctrine that 
the laws of nature do not alter with the course of time 
this we have already seen in the quotation from newton 
 the ultimate particles of matter are indestructible 
unalterable impenetrable for if they could break or 
wear the structure of material bodies now would be dif 
ferent from that which it was when the particles were 
new no philosopher will deny the truth which is thus 
conveyed by the assertion of atoms but it is obviously 
equally easy for a person who rejects the atomic view to 
state this truth by saying that the forces which matter 
exerts do not vary with time but however modified by 
the new modifications of its form are always unimpaired 



 philosophy of chemistry 

in quantity and capable of being restored to their former 
mode of action 

we now proceed to speculations in which the funda 
mental conceptions may perhaps be expressed at least 
in some cases by means of the arrangement of atoms 
but in which the philosophy of the subject appears to 
require a reference to a new fundamental idea

the philosophy of morphology 
including crystallography 



chapter i 
explication of the idea of symmetry 

 we have seen in the history of the sciences that 
a principle which i have there termed the principle of 
developed and metamorphosed symmetry has been exten 
sively applied in botany and physiology and has given 
rise to a province of science termed morphology in 
order to understand clearly this principle it is necessary 
to obtain a clear idea of the symmetry of which we thus 
speak but this idea of symmetry is applicable in the 
inorganic as well as in the organic kingdoms of nature 
it is presented to our eyes in the forms of minerals as 
well as of flowers and animals we must therefore take 
it under our consideration here in order that we may 
complete our view of mineralogy which as i have 
repeatedly said is an essential part of chemical science 
i shall accordingly endeavour to unfold the idea of sym 
metry with which we here have to do 

it will of course be understood that by the term sym 
metry i here intend not that more indefinite attribute of 
form which belongs to the domain of the fine arts as 
when we speak of the symmetry of an edifice or of a 

 hist ind sci iii 



 philosophy of morphology 

sculptured figure but a certain definite relation or pro 
perty no less rigorous and precise than other relations of 
number and position which is thus one of the sure guides 
of the scientific faculty and one of the bases of our exact 
science 

 in order to explain what symmetry is in this sense 
let the reader recollect that the bodies of animals consist 
of two equal and similar sets of members the right and 
the left side that some flowers consist of three or of five 
equal sets of organs similarly and regularly disposed as 
the iris has three straight petals and three reflexed ones 
alternately disposed the rose lisjive equal and similar 
sepals of the calyx and alternate with these as many 
petals of the corolla this orderly and exactly similar 
distribution of two or three or five or any other number 
of parts is symmetry and according to its various modi 
fications the forms thus determined are said to be sym 
metrical with various numbers of members the classifi 
cation of these different kinds of symmetry has been 
most attended to in crystallography in which science it 
is the highest and most general principle by which the 
classes of forms are governed without entering far 
into the technicalities of the subject we may point out 
some of the features of such classes 

the first of the figuresl in the 
margin may represent the summit 
of a crystal as it appears to an eye 
looking directly down upon it 
the centre of the figure repre 
sents the summit of a pyramid and the spaces of various 
forms which diverge from this point represent sloping sides 
of the pyramid now it will be observed that the figure 
consists of three portions exactly similar to one another 
and that each part or member is repeated in each of these 
portions the faces or pairs of faces are repeated in 





explication of the idea of symmetry 



 




threes with exactly similar forms and angles this figure is 
said to be threemembered or to have triangular symmetry 
the same kind of symmetry may exist in a flower as pre 
sented in the accompanying figure and does in fact occur 
in a large class of flowers as for example all the lily tribe 
the next pair of figures have four equal and similar 
portions and have their members 
or pairs of members four times re 
peated such figures are termed 
fourmembered and are said to 
have square or tetragonal symme 
try the pentagonal symmetry 
formed by five similar members 
is represented in the next figures 
b it occurs abundantly in the 
vegetable world but never among 
crystals for the pentagonal fi 
gures which crystals sometimes 
assume are never exactly regular 
but there is still another kind of 
symmetry in which the oppo 
site ends are exactly similar to 
each other and also the opposite 
sides this is oblong or twoand 
twomembered symmetry and 
finally we have the case of sim 
ple symmetry in which the 
two sides of the object are ex 
actly alike in opposite positions 
without any further repetition 

 these different kinds of symmetry occur in various 
ways in the animal vegetable and mineral kingdom thus 
vertebrate animals have a right and a left side exactly 
alike and thus possess simple symmetry the same kind 
of symmetry simple symmetry occurs very largely in the 
forms of vegetables as in most leaves in papilionaceous 







 philosophy of morphology 

personate and labiate flowers among minerals crystals 
which possess this symmetry are called obliqueprismatic 
and are of very frequent occurrence the oblong or 
twoandtwo membered symmetry belongs to rightprismatic 
crystals and may be seen in cruciferous flowers for 
though these are crossshaped the cross has two longer 
and two shorter arms or pairs of arms the square or 
tetragonal symmetry occurs in crystals abundantly to 
the vegetable world it appears to be less congenial 
for though there are flowers with four exactly similar 
and regularlydisposed petals as the herb paris paris 
quadrifolia these flowers appear from various circum 
stances to be deviations from the usual type of vege 
table forms the trigonal or tjireemembered symmetry is 
found abundantly both in plants and in crystals while the 
pentagonal symmetry on the other hand though by far 
the most common among flowers nowhere occurs in 
minerals and does not appear to be a possible form of 
crystals this pentagonal form further occurs in the ani 
mal kingdom which the oblong triangular and square 
forms do not many of cuviers radiate animals appear 
in this pentagonal form as echini and pentacrin ites which 
latter have hence their name 

 the regular or as they may be called the normal 
types of the vegetable world appear to be the forms which 
possess triangular and pentagonal symmetry from these 
the others may be conceived to be derived by transforma 
tions resulting from the expansion of one or more parts 
thus it is manifest that if in a threemembered or five 
membered flower one of the petals be expanded more 
than the other it is immediately reduced from pentagonal 
or trigonal to simple symmetry and the oblong or two 
andtwomembered symmetry of the flowers of crucife 
rous plants in which the stamens are four large and two 
small ones arranged in regular opposition is held by 



explication of the idea of symmetry 

botanists to result from a normal form with ten stamens 
meinecke explaining this by adhesion and sprengel by 
the metamorphosis of the stamens into petals 

it is easy to see that these various kinds of symmetry 
include relations both of form and of number but more 
especially of the latter kind and as this symmetry is 
often an important character in various classes of natural 
objects such classes have often curious numerical pro 
perties one of the most remarkable and extensive of 
these is the distinction which prevails between mono 
cotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants the number three 
being the ground of the symmetry of the former and the 
number jive of the latter thus liliaceous and bulbous 
plants and the like have flowers of three or six petals 
and the other organs follow the same numbers while 
the vast majority of plants are pentandrous and with their 
five stamens have also their other parts in fives this 
great numerical distinction corresponding to a leading 
difference of physiological structure cannot but be con 
sidered as a highly curious fact in phytology such 
properties of numbers thus connected in an incompre 
hensible manner with fundamental and extensive laws 
of nature give to numbers an appearance of myste 
rious importance and efficacy we learn from history 
how strongly the study of such properties as they are 
exhibited by the phenomena of the heavens took posses 
sion of the mind of kepler perhaps it was this which 
at an earlier period contributed in no small degree to 
the numerical mysticism of the pythagoreans in antiquity 
and of the arabians and others in the middle ages in 
crystallography numbers are the primary characters in 
which the properties of substances are expressed they 
appear first in that classification of forms which depends 
on the degree of symmetry that is upon the number of 
 sprengel gesch d bot ii 



 philosophy of morphology 

correspondencies and next in the laws of derivation 
which for the most part appear to be common in their 
occurrence in proportion to the numerical simplicity of 
their expression but the manifestation of a governing 
numerical relation in the organic world strikes us as more 
unexpected and the selection of the number five as the 
index of the symmetry of dicotyledonous plants and radi 
ated animals a number which is nowhere symmetrically 
produced in inorganic bodies makes this a new and 
remarkable illustration of the constancy of numerical rela 
tions we may observe however that the moment one 
of these radiate animals has one of its five members 
expanded or in any way peculiarly modified as happens 
among the echini it is reduced to the common type of 
animals simply symmetrical with a right and left side 

 it is not necessary to attempt to enumerate all the 
kinds of symmetry since our object is only to explain 
what symmetry is and for this purpose enough has 
probably been said already it will be seen as soon as 
the notion of symmetry in general is well apprehended 
that it is or includes a peculiar fundamental idea not 
capable of being resolved into any of the ideas hitherto 
examined it may be said perhaps that the idea of 
symmetry is a modification or derivative of our ideas of 
space and number that a symmetrical shape is one 
which consists of parts exactly similar repeated a certain 
number of times and placed so as to correspond with 
each other but on further reflection it will be seen 
that this repetition and correspondence of parts in sym 
metrical figures are something peculiar for it is not any 
repetition or any correspondence of parts to which we 
should give the name of symmetry in the manner in 
which we are now using the term symmetrical arrange 
ments may no doubt be concerned with space and posi 
tion time and number but there appears to be implied 



explication of the idea of symmetry 

in them a fundamental idea of regularity of complete 
ness of complex simplicity which is not a mere modifica 
tion of other ideas 

 it is however not necessary in this and in similar 
cases to determine whether the idea which we have 
before us be a peculiar and independent fundamental 
idea or a modification of other ideas provided we clearly 
perceive the evidence of those axioms by means of which 
the idea is applied in scientific reasonings now in the 
application of the idea of symmetry to crystallography 
phytology and zoology we must have this idea embodied 
in some principle which asserts more than a mere geome 
trical or numerical accordance of members we must 
have it involved in some vital or productive action in 
order that it may connect and explain the facts of the 
organic world nor is it difficult to enunciate such a 
principle we may state it in this manner all the 
symmetrical members of a natural product are under like 
circumstances alike affected the parts which we have 
termed symmetrical resemble each other not only in 
their form and position but also in the manner in which 
they are produced and modified by natural causes and 
this principle we assume to be necessarily true however 
unknown and inconceivable may be the causes which 
determine the phenomena thus it has not yet been 
found possible to discover or represent to ourselves in 
any intelligible manner the forces by which the various 
faces of a crystal are consequent upon its primary form 
but the whole of crystallography rests upon this principle 
that if one of the primary planes or axes be modified in 
any manner all the symmetrical planes and axes must be 
modified in the same manner and though accidental 
mechanical or other causes may interfere with the actual 
exhibition of such faces we do not the less assume their 
crystallographical reality as inevitably implied in the 



 philosophy of morphology 

law of symmetry of the crystal and we apply similar 
considerations to organized beings we assume that in 
a regular flower each of the similar members has the 
same organization and similar powers of developement 
and hence if among these similar parts some are much 
less developed than others we consider them as abortive 
and if we wish to remove doubts as to what are symme 
trical members in such a case we make the inquiry by 
tracing the anatomy of these members or by following 
them in their earlier states of developement or in cases 
where their capabilities are magnified by monstrosity or 
otherwise the power of developement may be modified 
by external causes and thus we may pass from one kind 
of symmetry to another as we have already remarked 
thus a regular flower with pentagonal symmetry growing 
on a lateral branch has one petal nearest to the axis of 
the plant if this petal be more or less expanded than the 
others the pentagonal symmetry is interfered with and 
the flower may change to a symmetry of another kind 
but it is easy to see that all such conceptions of expan 
sion abortion and any other kind of metamorphosis go 
upon the supposition of identical faculties and tendencies 
in each similar member in so far as such tendencies have 
any relation to the symmetry and thus the principle we 
have stated above is the basis of that which in the history 
we termed the principle of developed and metamor 
phosed symmetry 

we shall not at present pursue the other applications 
of this idea of symmetry but we shall consider some of 
the results of its introduction into crystallography 

 some crystalline forms instead of being holohedral provided 
with their whole number of faces are hemihedral provided with only 
half their number of faces but in these hemihedral forms the half 
of the faces are still symmetrically suppressed 



 



chapter ii 

application of the idea of symmetry 
to crystals 

 minerals and other bodies of definite chemical 
composition often exhibit that marked regularity of form 
and structure which we designate by terming them 
crystals and in such crystals when we duly study them 
we perceive the various kinds of symmetry of which we 
have spoken in the previous chapter and the different 
kinds of symmetry which we have there described are 
now usually distinguished from each other by writers on 
crystallography indeed it is mainly to such writers that 
we are indebted for a sound and consistent classification 
of the kinds and degrees of symmetry of which forms are 
capable but this classification was by no means invented 
as soon as mineralogists applied themselves to the study 
of crystals these first attempts to arrange crystalline 
forms were very imperfect those for example of lin 
nreus werner rome de lisle and haiiy the essays of 
these writers implied a classification at once defective 
and superfluous they reduced all crystals to one or 
other of certain fundamental forms and this procedure 
might have been a perfectly good method of dividing 
crystalline forms into classes if the fundamental forms 
had been selected so as to exemplify the different kinds 
of symmetry but this was not the case haiiys fun 
damental or primitive forms were for instance the 
following the parallelepiped the octahedron the tetra 
hedron the regular hexagonal prism the rhombic dodeca 
hedron and the double hexagonal pyramid of these 
the octahedron the tetrahedron the rhombic dodeca 
hedron all belong to the same kind of symmetry the 



 



philosophy of morphology 



tessular systems also the hexagonal prism and the 
hexagonal pyramid both belong to the rhombic system 
while the parallelepiped is so employed as to include all 
kinds of symmetry 

it is however to be recollected that haiiy in his 
selection of primitive forms not only had an eye to the 
external form of the crystal and to its degree and 
kind of regularity but also made his classification with 
an especial reference to the cleavage of the mineral 
which he considered as a primary element in crystalline 
analysis there can be no doubt that the cleavage of a 
crystal is one of its most important characters it is a 
relation of form belonging to the interior which is to be 
attended to no less than the form of the exterior but 
still the cleavage is to be regarded only as determining 
the degree of geometrical symmetry of the body and not 
as defining a special geometrical figure to which the body 
must be referred to have looked upon it in the latter 
light was a mistake of the earlier crystallographic specu 
lators on which we shall shortly have to remark 

 i have said that the reference of crystals to primi 
tive forms might have been well employed as a mode of 
expressing a just classification of them this follows as 
a consequence from the application of the principle stated 
in the last chapter that all symmetrical members are alike 
affected thus we may take an upright triangular prism 
as the representative of the rhombic system and if we then 
suppose one of the upper edges to be cut off or truncated 
we must by the principle of symmetry suppose the other 
two upper edges to be truncated in precisely the same 
manner by this truncation we may obtain the upper part 
of a rhombohedron and by truncations of the same kind 
symmetrically affecting all the analogous parts of the 
figure we may obtain any other form possessing three 
membered symmetry and the same is true of any of 



idea of symmetry in crystals 

the other kinds of symmetry provided we make a proper 
selection of a fundamental form and this was really 
the method employed by demeste werner and rome 
de lisle they assumed a primitive form and then con 
ceived other forms such as they found in nature to be 
derived from the primitive form by truncation of the 
edges acumination of the corners and the like processes 
this mode of conception was a perfectly just and legiti 
mate expression of the general idea of symmetry 

 the true view of the degrees of symmetry was as i 
have already said impeded by the attempts which haiiy 
and others made to arrive at primitive forms by the light 
which cleavage was supposed to throw upon the structure 
of minerals at last however in germany as i have 
narrated in the history of mineralogy weiss and mohs 
introduced a classification of forms implying a more phi 
losophical principle dividing the forms into systems 
which employing the terms of the latter writer we shall 
call the tessular the pyramidal or square pyramidal the 
prismatic or oblong and the rjiombohedral systems 

of these forms the three latter may be at once 
referred to those kinds of symmetry of which we have 
spoken in the last chapter the rhombohedral system 
has triangular symmetry or is threemembered the 
pyramidal has square symmetry or is fourmembered 
the prismatic has oblong symmetry and is twoandtwo 
membered but the kinds of symmetry which were 
spoken of in the former chapter do not exhaust the idea 
when applied to minerals for the symmetry which was 
there explained was such only as can be exhibited on a 
surface whereas the forms of crystals are solid not 
only have the right and left parts of the upper surface of 
a crystal relations to each other but the upper surface

 philosophy of morphology 

and the lateral faces of the crystal have also their rela 
tions they may be different or they may be alike 
if we take a cube and hold it so that four of its faces 
are vertical not only are all these four sides exactly simi 
lar so as to give square symmetry but also we may turn 
the cube so that any one of these four sides shall become 
the top and still the four sides which are thus made 
vertical though not the same which were vertical before 
are still perfectly symmetrical thus this cubical figure 
possesses more than square symmetry it possesses 
square symmetry in a vertical as well as in a horizontal 
sense it possesses a symmetry which has the same 
relation to a cube which fourmembered symmetry has to 
a square and this kind of symmetry is termed the 
cubical or tessular symmetry all the other kinds of 
symmetry have reference to an axis about which the cor 
responding parts are disposed but in tessular symmetry 
the horizontal and vertical axes are also symmetrical or 
interchangeable and thus the figure may be said to have 
no axis at all 

 it has already been repeatedly stated that by the 
very idea of symmetry all the incidents of form must 
affect alike all the corresponding parts now in crystals 
we have among these incidents not only external figure 
but cleavage which may be considered as internal figure 
cleavage then must conform to the degree of symmetry 
of the figure accordinglycleavage no less than form is 
to be attended to in determining to what system a mineral 
belongs if a crystal were to occur as a square prism or 
pyramid it would not on that account necessarily belong 
to the square pyramidal system if it were found that 
it was cleavable parallel to one side of the prism but not 
in the transverse direction it has only oblong symmetry 
and the equality of the sides which makes it square is 
only accidental 



idea of symmetry in crystals 

thus no cleavage is admissible in any system of 
crystallization which does not agree with the degree of 
symmetry of the system on the other hand any cleavage 
which is consistent with the symmetry of the system is 
hypothetically at least allowable thus in the oblong 
prismatic system we may have a cleavage parallel to one 
side only of the prism or parallel to both but of different 
distinctness or parallel to the two diagonals of the prism 
but of the same distinctness or we may have both these 
cleavages together in the rhombohedral system the 
cleavage may be parallel to the sides of the rhombo 
hedron as in calc spar or in the same system 
the cleavage instead of being thus oblique to the axis 
may be along the axis in those directions which make 
equal angles with each other this cleavage easily gives 
either a triangular or a hexagonal prism again in the 
tessular system the cleavage may be parallel to the sur 
face of the cube which is thus readily separable into 
other cubes as in galena or the cleavage may be such 
as to cut off the solid angle of the cube and since there 
are eight of these such cleavage gives us an octahedron 
which however may be reduced to a tetrahedron by 
rejecting all parallel faces as being mere repetitions of 
the same cleavage this is the case with fluor spar 
or the cube of the tessular system may be cleavable in 
planes which truncate all the edges of the cube and as 
these are twelve we thus obtain the dodecahedron with 
rhombic faces this occurs in zinc blende and thus 
we see the origin of hauys various primitive forms the 
tetrahedron octahedron and rhombic dodecahedron all 
belonging to the tessular system they are in fact dif 
ferent cleavage forms of that system 

 i do not dwell upon other incidents of crystals 
which have reference to form nor upon the lustre smooth 
ness and striation of the surfaces to all such incidents 

 f 



 philosophy of morphology 

the general principle applies that similar parts are simi 
larly affected and hence if any parts are found to be 
constantly and definitely different from other parts of the 
same sort they are not similar parts and the symmetry 
is to be interpreted with reference to this difference 

we have now to consider the inferences which have 
been drawn from these incidents of crystallization with 
regard to the intimate structure of bodies 



chapter iii 

speculations founded upon the 
symmetry of crystals 

 when a crystal as for instance a crystal of galena 
sulphuret of lead is readily divisible into smaller cubes 
and these into smaller ones and so on without limit it is 
very natural to represent to ourselves the original cube as 
really consisting of small cubical elements and to imagine 
that it is a philosophical account of the physical structure 
of such a substance to say that it is made up of cubical 
molecules and when the galena crystal has externally 
the form of a cube there is no difficulty in such a concep 
tion for the surface of the crystal is also conceived as 
made up of the surfaces of its cubical molecules we 
conceive the crystal so constituted as we conceive a wall 
built of bricks 

but if as often happens the galena crystal be an 
octahedron a further consideration is requisite in order 
to understand its structure pursuing still the same hypo 
thesis the mineral is still as in the other case readily 
cleavable into small cubes having their corners turned 
to the faces of the octahedron therefore these faces 
can no longer be conceived as made up of the faces of 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

cubical elements of which the whole is constituted if 
we suppose a pile of such small cubes to be closely built 
together but with decreasing width above so as to form 
a pyramid the face of such a pyramid will no longer be 
plane it will consist of a great number of the corners 
or edges of the small elementary cubes it would ap 
pear at first sight therefore that such a face cannot 
represent the smooth polished surface of a crystal 

but when we come to look more closely this diffi 
culty disappears for how large are these elementary 
cubes we cannot tell even supposing they really have 
any size but we know that they must be at any rate 
very small so small as to be inappreciable by our senses 
for our senses find no limit to the divisibility of minerals 
by cleavage hence the surface of the pyramid above 
described would not consist of visible corners or edges 
but would be roughened by specks of imperceptible size 
or rather by supposing these specks to become still 
smaller the roughness becomes smoothness and thus 
we may have a crystal with a smooth surface made up of 
small cubes in such a manner that their surfaces are all 
oblique to the surface of the crystal 

haiiy struck by some instances in which the suppo 
sition of such a structure of crystals appeared to account 
happily for several of their relations and properties 
adopted and propounded it as a general theory the 
small elements of which he supposed crystals to be thus 
built up he termed integrant molecules the form of 
these molecules might or might not be the same as the 
primitive form with which his construction was supposed 
to begin but there was at any rate a close connexion 
between these forms since both of them were founded 
on the cleavage of the mineral the tenet that crystals 
are constituted in the manner which i have been de 
scribing i shall call the theory of integrant molecules 



 philosophy of morphology 

and i have now to make some remarks on the grounds of 
this theory 

 in the case of which i have spoken the mineral 
used as the example galena readily splits into cubes and 
cubes are easily placed together so as to fit each other 
and fill the space which they occupy the same is the 
case in the mineral which suggested to haiiy his theory 
namely calc spar the crystals of this substance are 
readily divisible into rhombohedrons a form like a brick 
with oblique angles and such bricks can be built to 
gether so as to produce crystals of all the immense varie 
ties of form which calc spar presents this kind of 
masonry is equally possible in many other minerals but 
as we go through the mineral kingdom in our survey we 
soon find cases which offer difficulties some minerals 
cleave only in two directions some in one only in such 
cases we cannot by cleavage obtain an integrant mole 
cule of definite form one of its dimensions at least 
must remain indeterminate and arbitrary again in 
some instances we have more than three different planes 
of cleavage as in fluor spar where we have four the 
solid bounded by four planes is a tetrahedron or if we 
take four pairs of parallel faces an octahedron but if 
we attempt to take either of these forms for our inte 
grant molecule we are met by this difficulty that a col 
lection of such forms will not fill space perhaps this 
difficulty will be more readily conceived by the general 
reader if it be contemplated with reference to plane 
figures it will readily be seen that a number of equal 
squares may be put together so as to fill the space which 
they occupy but if we take a number of equal regular 
octagons we may easily convince ourselves that no pos 
sible arrangement can make them cover a flat space with 
out leaving blank spots between in like manner octa 
hedrons or tetrahedrons cannot be arranged in solid space 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

so as to fill it they necessarily leave vacancies hence 
the structure of fluor spar and similar crystals was a 
serious obstacle in the way of the theory of integrant 
molecules that theory had been adopted in the first 
instance because portions of the crystal obtained by 
cleavage could be built up into a solid mass but this 
ground of the theory failed altogether in such instances 
as i have described and hence the theory even upon the 
representations of its adherents had no longer any claim 
to assent 

the doctrine of integral molecules however was by 
no means given up at once even in such instances in 
this and in other subjects we may observe that a theory 
once constructed and carried into detail has such a hold 
upon the minds of those who have been in the habit of 
applying it that they will attempt to uphold it by intro 
ducing suppositions inconsistent with the original founda 
tions of the theory thus those who assert the atomic 
theory reconcile it with facts by taking the halves of atoms 
and thus the theory of integrant molecules was maintained 
for fluor spar by representing the elementary octahedrons 
of which crystals are built up as touching each other only 
by the edges the contact of surface with surface amongst 
integrant molecules had been the first basis of the theory 
but this supposition being here inapplicable was replaced 
by one which made the theory no longer a representation 
of the facts the cleavages but a mere geometrical con 
struction although however the inapplicability of the 
theory to such cases was thus in some degree disguised 
to the disciples of haiiy it was plain that in the face of 
such difficulties the theory of integrant molecules could 
not hold its place as a philosophical truth but it still 
answered the purpose a very valuable one and one to 
which crystallography is much indebted of an instru 
ment for calculating the geometrical relations of the parts 



 philosophy of morphology 

of crystals to each other for the integrant molecules 
were supposed to be placed layer above layer each layer 
as we ascend decreasing by a certain number of mole 
cules and rows of molecules and the calculation of these 
laws of decrement was in fact the best mode then known 
of determining the positions of the faces the theory 
of decrements served to express and to determine in 
a great number of the most obvious cases the laws of 
phenomena in crystalline forms though the theory of 
integrant molecules could not be maintained as a just 
view of the structure of crystals 

 the theory of integrant molecules however in 
volved this just and important principle that a true view 
of the intimate structure of crystals must include and 
explain the facts of crystallization that is crystalline 
form and cleavage and that it must take these into 
account according to their degree of symmetry so far 
all theories concerning the elements of crystals must 
agree and it was soon seen that this was in reality all 
that had been established by the investigations of haiiy 
and his school i have already in the history quoted 
weisss reflections on making this step when in 
 he says i published my dissertation i shared 
the common opinion as to the necessity of the assump 
tion and the reality of the existence of a primitive form 
at least in a sense not very different from the usual sense 
of the expression he then proceeds to relate that he 
sought a ground for such an opinion independent of the 
doctrine of atoms which he in common with a great 
number of philosophers of that time in his own country 
was disposed to reject inclining to believe that the pro 
perties of bodies were determined by forces which acted 
in them and not by molecules of which they were com 
posed he adds that in pursuing this train of thought 

 acad berlin p 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

he found that out of his primitive forms there was gra 
dually unfolded to his hands that which really governs 
them and is not affected by their casual fluctuations 
namely the fundamental relations of their dimensions 
or aswe now may call them axes of symmetry with 
reference to these axes he found as he goes on to say 
that a multiplicity of internal oppositions necessarily 
and mutually interdependent are developed in the crys 
talline mass each relation having its own polarity so 
that the crystalline character is coextensive with these 
polarities the character of these polarities whether 
manifested in crystalline faces cleavage or any other 
incidents of crystallization is necessarily displayed in the 
degree and kind of symmetry which the crystal possesses 
and thus this symmetry in all our speculations concern 
ing the structure of crystals necessarily takes the place 
of that enumeration of primitive forms which were re 
jected as inconsistent with observed facts and destitute 
of sound scientific principle 

i may just notice here what i have stated in the his 
tory of mineralogy that the distinction of systems of 
crystallization as introduced by weiss and mohs was 
strikingly confirmed by sir david brewsters discoveries 
respecting the optical properties of minerals the splen 
did phenomena which were produced by passing polarized 
light through crystals were found to vary according as 
the crystals were of the rhombohedral square pyramidal 
oblong prismatic or tessular system the optical exactly 
corresponded with the geometrical symmetry in the 
two former systems were crystals uniaxal in respect of 
their optical properties the oblong prismatic was biaxal 
while in the tessular the want of a predominant axis pre 
vented the phenomena here spoken of from occurring at 
all the optical experiments must have led to a classifi 

 hist tnd sci iii 



 philosophy of morphology 

cation of crystals into the above systems or something 
nearly equivalent even had they not been already so 
arranged by attention to their forms 

 while in germany weiss and mohs with their 
disciples were gradually rejecting what was superfluous 
in the previous crystallographical hypotheses philosophers 
in england were also trying to represent to themselves 
the constitution of crystals in a manner which should be 
free from the obviously arbitrary and untenable fictions 
of the haiiyian school these attempts how r ever were 
not crowned with much success one mode of repre 
senting the structure of crystals which suggested itself 
was to reject the polyhedral forms which haiiy gave to 
his integrant molecules and to conceive the elements of 
crystals as spheres the properties of the crystal being 
determined not by the surfaces but by the position of 
the elements tnis was done by wollaston in the phi 
losophical transactions for he applied this view to 
the tessular system in which indeed the application is 
not difficult and he showed that octahedral and tetrahe 
dral figures may be deduced from symmetrical arrange 
ments of equal spherules but though in doing this he 
manifested a perception of the conditions of the problem 
he appeared to lose his hold on the real question when he 
tried to pass on to other systems of crystallization for 
he accounted for the rhombohedral system by supposing 
the spheres changed into spheroids such a procedure 
involved him in a gratuitous and useless hypothesis for 
to what purpose do we introduce the arrangement of 
atoms instead of their figure as a mode of explaining 
the symmetry of the crystallization when at the next 
step we ascribe to the atom by an arbitrary fiction a 
symmetry of figure of the same kind as that which we 
have to explain it is just as easy and as allowable to 
assume an elementary rhombohedron as to assume ele 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

mentary spheroids of which the rhombohedrons are 
constructed 

 many hypotheses of the same kind might be 
adduced devised both by mineralogists and chemists 
but almost all such speculations have been pursued with 
a most surprising neglect of the principle which obviously 
is the only sound basis on which they can proceed 
the principle is this that all hypotheses concerning the 
arrangement of the elementary atoms of bodies in space 
must be constructed with reference to the general facts of 
crystallization the truth and importance of this prin 
ciple can admit of no doubt for if we make any 
hypothesis concerning the mode ef connexion of the 
elementary particles of bodies this must be done with 
the view of representing to ourselves the forces which 
connect them and the results of these forces as mani 
fested in the properties of the bodies now the forces 
which connect the particles of bodies so as to make 
them crystalline are manifestly chemical forces it is 
only definite chemical compounds which crystallize and 
in crystals the force of cohesion by which the particles 
are held together cannot in any way be distinguished or 
separated from the chemical force by which their elements 
are combined the elements are understood to be com 
bined precisely because tne result is a definite apparently 
homogeneous substance the properties of the com 
pound bodies depend upon the elements and their mode 
of combination for in fact these include everything on 
which they can depend there are no other circum 
stances than these which can affect the properties of a 
body therefore all those properties which have refer 
ence to space namely the crystalline properties cannot 
depend upon anything else than the arrangement of the 
elementary molecules in space these properties are 
the facts which any hypothesis of the arrangement of 



 philosophy of morphology 

molecules must explain or at least render conceivable 
and all such hypotheses all constructions of bodies by 
supposed arrangements of molecules can have no other 
philosophical object than to account for facts of this 
kind if they do not do this they are mere arbitrary 
geometrical fictions which cannot be in any degree con 
firmed or authorized by an examination of nature and 
are therefore not deserving of any regard 

 those philosophers who have endeavoured to repre 
sent the mode in which bodies are constructed by the 
combination of their chemical atoms have often under 
taken to show not only that the atoms are combined but 
also in what positions and configurations they are com 
bined and it is truly remarkable as i have already 
said that they have done this almost in every instance 
without any consideration of the crystalline character of 
the resulting combinations from which alone we receive 
any light as to the relation of their elements in space 
thus dr dalton in his elements of chemistry in which 
he gave to the world the atomic theory as a representa 
tion of the doctrine of definite and multiple proportions 
also published a large collection of diagrams exhibiting 
what he conceived to be the configuration of the atoms 
in a great number of the most common combinations of 
chemical elements now these hypothetical diagrams 
do not in any way correspond as to the nature of their 
symmetry with the compounds as we find them display 
ing their symmetry when they occur crystallized car 
bonate of lime has in reality a triangular symmetry since 
it belongs to the rhombohedral system dr daltons 
carbonate of lime would be an oblique rhombic prism or 
pyramid sulphate of baryta is really twoandtwo 
membered dr daltons diagram makes it twoandone 
membered alum is really octahedral or tessular but 
according to the diagram it could not be so since the 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

two ends of the atom are not symmetrical and the 
same want of correspondence between the facts and the 
hypothesis runs through the whole system it need not 
surprise us that the theoretical arrangement of atoms 
does not explain the facts of crystallization for to pro 
duce such an explanation would be a second step in 
science quite as great as the first the discovery of the 
atomic theory in its chemical sense but we may allow 
ourselves to be surprised that an utter discrepance be 
tween all the facts of crystallization and the figures 
assumed in the theory did not suggest any doubt as to 
the soundness of the mode of philosophizing by which 
this part of the theory was constructed 

 some little accordance between the hypothetical 
arrangements of chemical atoms and the facts of crystal 
lization does appear to have been arrived at by some of 
the theorists to whom we here refer although by no 
means enough to show a due conviction of the importance 
of the principle stated above thus wollaston in the 
essay above noticed after showing that a symmetrical 
arrangement of equal spherules would give rise to octa 
hedral and other tessular figures remarks very properly 
that the metals which are simple bodies crystallize in 
such forms m ampere also in published a 
brief account of an hypothesis of a somewhat similar 
nature and stated himself to have developed this specu 
lation in a memoir which has not yet so far as i am 
aware been published in this notice he conceives bodies 
to be compounded of molecules which arranged in a poly 
hedral form constitute particles these representative 
forms of the particles depend on chemical laws thus 
the particles of oxygen of hydrogen and of azote are 
composed each of four molecules hence it is collected 
that the particles of nitrous gas are composed of two 

 annde chimie torn xc p 



 philosophy of morphology 

molecules of oxygen and two of azote and similar con 
clusions are drawn respecting other substances these 
conclusions though expressed by means of the polyhe 
drons thus introduced are supported by chemical rather 
than by crystallographical comparisons the author does 
indeed appeal to the crystallization of sal ammoniac as 
an argument but as all the forms which he introduces 
appear to belong to the tessular system of crystallization 
there is in his reasonings nothing distinctive and 
therefore nothing crystallographically speaking of any 
weight on the side of this theory 

 any hypothesis which should introduce any prin 
ciple of chemical order among the actual forms of mine 
rals would well deserve attention at first sight nothing 
can appear more anomalous than the forms which occur 
we have indeed one broad fact which has an encou 
raging aspect the tessular forms in which the pure metals 
crystallize the highest degree of chemical and of geo 
metrical simplicity coincide irregularity disappears pre 
cisely where it is excluded by the consideration above 
stated that the symmetry of chemical composition must 
determine the symmetry of crystalline form 

but if we go on to any other class of crystalline 
forms we soon find ourselves lost in our attempts to 
follow any thread of order we have indeed many large 
groups connected by obvious analogies as the rhombo 
hedral carbonates of lime magnesia iron manganese 
the prismatic carbonates and sulphates of lime baryta 
strontia lead but even in these we cannot form any 
plausible hypothesis of the arrangement of the elements 
and in other cases to which we naturally turn we can 
find nothing but confusion for instance if we examine 
the oxides of metals those of iron are rhombohedral 
and tessular those of copper tessular those of tin of 

 ann de chirme torn xc p 



speculations on the symmetry of crystals 

titanium of manganese square pyramidal those of 
antimony prismatic and we have other forms for other 
substances 

it may be added that if we take account of the 
optical properties which as we have already stated have 
constant relations to the crystalline forms the confusion 
is still further increased for the optical dimensions vary 
in amount though not in symmetry where chemistry can 
trace no difference of composition 

 we will not quit the subject however without 
noticing the much more promising aspect which it 
has assumed by the detection of such groups as are 
referred to in the last article or in other words by 
mitscherlichs discovery of isomorphism according to 
that discovery there are various elements which may 
take the place of each other in crystalline bodies either 
without any alteration of the crystalline form or at most 
with only a slight alteration of its dimensions such a 
group of elements we have in the earths lime and mag 
nesia the protoxides of iron and manganese for the car 
bonates of all these bases occur crystallized in forms of 
the rhombohedral system the characteristic angle being 
nearly the same in all now lime and magnesia by the 
discoveries of modern chemistry are really oxides of 
metals and therefore all these carbonates have a similar 
chemical constitution while they have also a similar 
crystalline form whether or no we can devise any 
arrangement of molecules by which this connexion of 
the chemical and the geometrical property can be repre 
sented we cannot help considering the connexion as an 
extremely important fact in the constitution of bodies 
and such facts are more likely than any other to give us 
some intelligible view of the relations of the ultimate 
parts of bodies the same may be said of all the other 



 philosophy of morphology 

isomorphous or plesiomorphous groups for instance 
we have a number of minerals which belong to the same 
system of crystallization but in which the chemical com 
position appears at first sight to be very various namely 
spinelle pleonaste gahnite franklinite chromic iron 
oxide magnetic iron oxide but abich has shown that 
all these may be reduced to a common chemical formula 
they are bioxides of one set of bases combined with 
trioxides of another set perhaps some mathematician 
may be able to devise some geometrical arrangement of 
such a group of elements which may possess the properties 
of the tessular system hypothetical arrangements of 
atoms thus expressing both the chemical and the crys 
talline symmetry which we know to belong to the sub 
stance would be valuable steps in analytical science and 
when they had been duly verified the hypotheses might 
easily be divested of their atomic character 

thus as we have already said mineralogy understood 
in its wider sense as the counterpart of chemistry has 
for one of its main objects to discover those relations of 
the elements of bodies which have reference to space 
in this research the foundation of all sound speculation 
is the kind and degree of symmetry of form which we 
find in definite chemical compounds and the problem 
at present before the inquirer is to devise such arrange 
ments of molecules as shall answer the conditions alike 
of chemistry and of crystallography 

we now proceed to the classificatory sciences of 
which mineralogy is one though hitherto by far the least 
successful

chapter i 

the idea of likeness as governing the 
use of common names 

 object of the chapter not only the classificatory 
sciences but the application of names to things in the 
rudest and most unscientific manner depends upon our 
apprehending them as like each other we must there 
fore endeavour to trace the influence and operation of 
the idea of likeness in the common use of language 
before we speak of the conditions under which it acquires 
its utmost exactness and efficacy 

it will be my object to show in this as in previous 
cases that the impressions of sense are apprehended by 
acts of the mind and that these mental acts necessarily 
imply certain relations which may be made the subjects 
of speculative reasoning we shall have if we can to 
seize and bring into clear view the principles which the 
relation of like and unlike involves and the mode in 
which these principles have been developed 

 unity of the individual but before we can attend 
to several things as like or unlike we must be able to 
apprehend each of these by itself as one thing it may at 
first sight perhaps appear that this apprehension results 
immediately from the impressions on our senses without 

vol i g 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

any act of our thoughts a very little attention how 
ever enables us to see that thus to single out special 
objects requires a mental operation as well as a sensation 
how for example without an exertion of mental activity 
can we see one tree in a forest where there are many we 
have spread before us a collection of colours and forms 
green and brown dark and light irregular and straight 
this is all that sensation gives or can give but we asso 
ciate one brown trunk with one portion of the green mass 
excluding the rest although the neighbouring leaves are 
both nearer in contiguity and more similar in appearance 
than is the stem we thus have before us one tree but 
this unity is given by the mind itself we see the green 
and the brown but we must make the tree before we can 
see it 

that this composition of our sensations so as to form 
one thing implies an act of our own will perhaps be more 
readily allowed if we once more turn our attention to 
the manner in which we sometimes attempt to imitate 
and record the objects of sight by drawing when we do 
this as we have already observed we mark this unity of each 
object by drawing a line to separate the parts which we 
include from those which we exclude an outline this 
line corresponds to nothing which we see the beginner 
in drawing has great difficulty in discerning it he has in 
fact to make it it is as has been said by a painter of 
our own time a fiction but it is a fiction employed to 
mark a real act of the mind to designate the singleness 
of the object in our conception as we have said else 
where we see lines but especially outlines by mentally 
drawing them ourselves 

the same act of conception which the outline thus 
represents and commemorates in visible objects the same 
combination of sensible impressions into a unit is exer 

 phillips on painting design 



the idea of likeness 

cised also with regard to the objects of all our senses and 
the singleness thus given to each object is a necessary 
preliminary to its being named or represented in any 
other way 

but it may be said is it then by an arbitrary act of 
our own that we put together the branches of the same 
tree or the limbs of the same animal have we equally 
the power and the right to make the branch of the fir a 
part of the neighbouring oak can we include in the 
outline of a man any object with which he happens to be 
in contact 

such suppositions are manifestly absurd and the 
answer is that though we give unity to objects by an 
act of thought it is not by an arbitrary act but by a 
process subject to certain conditions to conditions which 
exclude such incongruous combinations as have just been 
spoken of 

what are these conditions which regulate our appre 
hension of an object as one which determine what por 
tion of our impressions does and what portion does not 
belong to the same thing 

 condition of unity i reply that the primary and 
fundamental condition is that we must be able to make 
intelligible assertions respecting the object and to enter 
tain that belief of which assertions are the exposition a 
tree grows sheds its leaves in autumn and buds again in 
the spring waves in the wind or falls before the storm 
and to the tree belong all those parts which must be 
included in order that such declarations and the thoughts 
which they convey shall have a coherent and permanent 
meaning those are its branches which wave and fall with 
its trunk those are its leaves which grow on its branches 
the permanent connexions which we observe perma 
nent among unconnected changes which affect the sur 
rounding appearances are what we bind together as 

 g 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

belonging to one object this permanence is the condi 
tion of our conceiving the object as one the connected 
changes may always be described by means of assertions 
and the connexion is seen in the identity of the subject of 
successive predications in the possibility of applying 
many verbs to one substantive we may therefore express 
the condition of the unity of an object to be this that 
assertions concerning the object shall be possible or rather 
we should say that the acts of belief which such assertions 
enunciate shall be possible 

it may seem to be superfluous to put in a form so 
abstract and remote the grounds of a process apparently 
so simple as our conceiving an object to be one but 
the same condition to which we have thus been led as 
the essential principle of the unity of objects namely 
that propositions shall be possible will repeatedly occur 
in the present chapter and it may serve to illustrate our 
views to show that this condition pervades even the 
simplest cases 

 kinds the mental synthesis of which we have 
thus spoken gives us our knowledge of individual things 
it enables me to apprehend that particular tree or man 
which i now see or by the help of memory the tree or 
the man i saw yesterday but the knowledge with 
which we have mainly here to do is not a knowledge of 
individuals but of kinds of such classes as are indicated 
by common names we have to make assertions con 
cerning a tree or a man in general without regarding 
what is peculiar to this man or that tree 

now it is clear that certain individual objects are all 
called man or all called tree in virtue of some resemblance 
which they have if we had not the power of perceiving 
in the appearances around us likeness and unlikeness 
we could not consider objects as distributed into kinds at 
all the impressions of sense would throng upon us but 



the idea of likeness 

being uncompared with each other they would flow away 
like the waves of the sea and each vanish from our con 
templation when the sensation faded that we do appre 
hend surrounding objects as belonging to permanent kinds 
as being men and horses oaks and roses arises from our 
having the idea of likeness and from our applying it 
habitually and so far as such a classification requires 

not only can we employ the idea of likeness in this 
manner but we apply it incessantly and universally to 
the whole mass and train of our sensations for we have 
no external sensations to which we cannot apply some 
language or other and all language necessarily implies 
recognition of resemblances we cannot call an object 
green or round without comparing in our thoughts its 
colour or its shape with a shape and a colour seen in 
other objects all our sensations therefore without any 
exception of kind or time are subject to this constant 
process of classification and the idea of likeness is per 
petually operating to distribute them into kinds at least 
so far as the use of language requires 

we come then again to the question upon what 
principle under what conditions is the idea of likeness 
thus operative what are the limits of the classes thus 
formed where does that similarity end which induces 
and entitles us to call a thing a tree what universal 
rule is there for the application of common names so 
that we may not apply them wrongly 

 not made ty definitions perhaps some one might 
expect in answer to these inquiries a definition or a series 
of definitions might imagine that some description of a 
tree might be given which might show when the term 
was applicable and when it was not and that we might 
construct a body of rules to which such descriptions must 
conform but on consideration it will be clear that the 
real solution of our difficulty cannot be obtained in such 



 philosophy op the classificatory sciences 

a manner for first such descriptions must be given in 
words and therefore suppose that we have already satisfied 
ourselves how words are to be used if we define a 
tree to be a living thing without the power of voluntary 
motion we shall be called upon to define a living thing 
and it is manifest that this renewal of the demand for 
definition might be repeated indefinitely and therefore 
we cannot in this way come to a final principle and in 
the next place most of those who use language even with 
great precision and consistency would find it difficult or 
impossible to give good definitions even of a few of the 
general names which they use and therefore their prac 
tice cannot be regulated by any tacit reference to such de 
finitions that definitions of terms are of great use and 
importance in their right place we shall soon see but 
their place is not to regulate the use of common language 

what then once more is this regulative principle 
what rules do men follow in the use of words so as 
commonly to avoid confusion and ambiguity how do 
they come to understand each other so well as they 
ordinarily do respecting the limits of classes never de 
fined and which they cannot define what is the 
common convention or condition to which they conform 

 condition of the use of terms to this we reply 
that the condition which regulates the use of language 
is that it shall be capable of being used that is that 
general assertions shall be possible the term tree is 
applicable as far as it is useful in expressing our know 
ledge concerning trees thus we know that trees are 
fixed in the ground have a solid stem branches leaves 
and many other properties with regard to all the objects 
which surround us we have an immense store of know 
ledge of such properties and we employ the names of the 
objects in such a manner as enables us to express these 
properties 



the idea of likeness 

but the connexion of such properties is variable and in 
definite some properties are constantly combined others 
occasionally only the leaves of different oaks resemble 
each other the branches resemble far less and may differ 
very widely the term oak does not enable us to say that 
all oaks have straight branches or all crooked terms can 
only express properties as far as they are constant not 
only therefore the accumulation of a vast mass of know 
ledge of the properties and attributes of objects but also 
an observation of the habitual connexion of such properties 
is needed to direct us to the consistent application of 
terms to enable us to apply them so as to express 
truths but here again we are largely provided with the 
requisite knowledge and observation by the common 
course of our existence the unintermitting stream of 
experience supplies us with an incalculable amount of 
such observed connexions all men have observed that 
the associations of the same form of leaves are more con 
stant than of the same form of branches that though 
persons walk in different attitudes none go on all fours 
and thus the term oak is so applied as to include those 
cases in which the leaves are alike in form though the 
branches be unlike and though we should refuse to 
apply the term man to a class of creatures which habi 
tually and without compulsion used four legs we make no 
scruple of affixing it to persons of very different figures 
the whole of human experience being composed of such 
observed connexions we have thus materials even for 
the immense multiplicity of names which human language 
contains all which names are as we have said regulated 
in their application by the condition of expressing such 
experience 

thus amid the countless combinations of properties 
and divisions of classes which the structure of language 
implies scarcely any are arbitrary or capricious a word 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

which expressed a mere wanton collection of unconnected 
attributes could hardly be called a word for of such a 
collection of properties no truth could be asserted and 
the word would disappear for want of some occasion on 
which it could be used though much of the fabric of 
language appears not unnaturally fantastical and purely 
conventional it is in fact otherwise the associations 
and distinctions of phraseology are not more fanciful than 
is requisite to make them correspond to the apparent 
caprices of nature or of thought and though much in 
language may be called conventional the conventions 
exist for the sake of expressing some truth or opinion 
and not for their own sake the principle that the con 
dition of the use of terms is the possibility of general intelli 
gible consistent assertions is true in the most complete 
and extensive sense 

 terms may have different uses the terms with 
which we are here most concerned are names of classes 
of natural objects and when we say that the principle 
and the limit of such names are their use in expressing 
propositions concerning the classes it is clear that much 
will depend on the kind of propositions which we mainly 
have to express and that the same name may have 
different limits according to the purpose we have in view 
for example is the whale properly included in the 
general term fish f when men are concerned in catching 
marine animals the main features of the process are the 
same however the animals may differ hence whales are 
classed with fishes and we speak of the whalefishery 
but if we look at the analogies of organization we find 
that according to these the whale is clearly not a fish but 
a beast confining this term for the sake of distinctness 
to suckling beasts or mammals in natural history there 
fore the whale is not included among fish the indefi 
nite and miscellaneous propositions which language is 



the idea of likeness 

employed to enunciate in the course of common practical 
life are replaced by a more coherent and systematic 
collection of properties when we come to aim at scientific 
knowledge but we shall hereafter consider the principle 
of the classifications of natural history our present 
subject is the application of the idea of likeness in 
common practice and common language 

 gradation of kinds common names then in 
clude many individuals associated in virtue of resem 
blances and of permanently connected properties and 
such names are applicable as far as they serve to express 
such properties these collections of individuals are 
termed kinds sorts classes 

but this association of particulars is capable of degrees 
as individuals by their resemblances form kinds so kinds 
of things though different may resemble each other so as 
to be again associated in a higher class and there may 
be several successive steps of such classification man 
horse tree stone are each a name of a kind but animal 
includes the two first and excludes the others living 
thing is a term which includes animal and tree but not 
stone body includes all the four and such a subordi 
nation of kinds may be traced very widely in the arrange 
ments of language 

the condition of the use of the wider is the same as 
that of the narrower names of classes they are good as 
far as they serve to express true propositions in com 
mon language though such an order of generality may in 
a variety of instances be easily discerned it is not sys 
tematically and extensively referred to but this subordi 
nation and graduated comprehensiveness is the essence of 
the methods and nomenclatures of natural history as we 
shall soon have to show 

but such subordination is not without its use even in 
common cases and when it is expressed in the terms of 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

common language thus organized body is a term which 
includes plants and animals animal includes beasts birds 
fishes beast includes horses and dogs dogs again are 
greyhounds spaniels terriers 

 characters of kinds now when we have such a 
series of names and classes we find that we take for 
granted irresistibly that each class has some character 
which distinguishes it from other classes included in the 
superior division we ask what kind of beast a dog is 
what kind of animal a beast is and we assume that such 
questions admit of answer that each kind has some 
mark or marks by which it may be described and such 
descriptions may be given an animal is an organized 
body having sensation and volition man is a reasonable 
animal whether or no we assent to the exactness of 
these definitions we allow the propriety of their form 
if we maintain these to be wrong we must believe some 
others to be right however difficult it may be to hit upon 
them we entertain a conviction that there must be 
among things so classed and named a possibility of defin 
ing each 

now what is the foundation of this postulate what 
is the ground of this assumption that there must exist a 
definition which we have never seen and which perhaps 
no one has seen in a satisfactory form the knowledge 
of this definition is by no means necessary to our using 
the word with propriety for any one can make true asser 
tions about dogs but who can define a dog and yet if 
the definition be not necessary to enable us to use the 
word why is it necessary at all we allow that we pos 
sess an indestructible conviction that there must be such 
a character of each kind as will supply a definition but 
we ask on what this conviction rests 

i reply that our persuasion that there must needs be 
characteristic marks by which things can be defined in 



the idea of likeness 

words is founded on the assumption of the necessary pos 
sibility of reasoning 

the reference of any object or conception to its class 
without definition may give us a persuasion that it shares 
the properties of its class but does not enable us to rea 
son upon those properties when we consider man as 
an animal we ascribe to him in thought the appetites 
desires affections which we habitually include in our 
notion of animal but except we have expressed these in 
some definition or acknowledged description of the term 
animal we can make no use of the persuasion in ratioci 
nation but if we have described animals as beings 
impelled to action by appetites and passions we can not 
only think but say man is an animal and therefore he 
is impelled to act by appetites and passions and if we 
add a further definition that man is a reasonable ani 
mal and if it appear that reason implies conformity 
to a rule of action we can then further infer that mans 
nature is to conform the results of animal appetite and 
passion to a rule of action 

the possibility of pursuing any such jtrain of reason 
ing as this depends on the definitions of animal and of 
man which we have introduced and the possibility of 
reasoning concerning the objects around us being inevit 
ably assumed by us from the constitution of our nature 
we assume consequently the possibility of such definitions 
as may thus form part of our deduction and the existence 
of such defining characters 

 difficult of definitions but though men are on 
such grounds led to make constant and importunate 
demands for definitions of the terms which they employ 
in their speculations they are in fact far from being 
able to carry into complete effect the postulate on which 
they proceed that they must be able to find definitions 
which by logical consequence shall lead to the truths 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

they seek the postulate overlooks the process by which 
our classes of things are formed and our names applied 
this process consisting as we have already said in 
observing permanent connexions of properties and in 
fixing them by the attribution of names is of the nature 
of the process of induction of which we shall afterwards 
have to speak and the postulate is so far true that 
this process of induction being once performed its result 
may usually be expressed by means of a few definitions 
and may thus lead by a deduction to a train of real truths 

but in the subjects where we principally find such a 
subordination of classes as we have spoken of this pro 
cess of deduction is rarely of much prominence for 
example in the branches of natural history yet it is 
in these subjects that the existence and importance of 
these characteristic marks which we have spoken of 
principally comes into view in treating of these marks 
however we enter upon methods which are technical and 
scientific not popular and common and before we 
make this transition we have a remark to make on the 
manner in which writers without reference to physics or 
natural history have spoken of kinds their subordination 
and their marks 

 the five words these things the nature 
and relations of classes were in fact the subjects of 
minute and technical treatment by the logicians of the 
school of aristotle porphyry wrote an introduction to 
the categories of that philosoper which is entitled on the 
five words the five words are genus species 
difference property accident genus and species are 
superior and inferior classes and are stated to be capable 
of repeated subordination the most general genus 
is the widest class the most special species the nar 
rowest between these are intermediate classes which 
 porphyr isagog c 



the idea of likeness 

are genera with regard to those below and species with 
regard to those above them thus being is the most 
general genus under this is body under body is living 
body under this again animal under animal is rational 
animal or man under man are socrates and plato and 
other individual men 

the difference is that which is added to the genus 
to make the species thus rational is the difference by 
which the genus animal is made the species man the 
difference in this technical sense is the specific or 
speciesmaking difference it forms the definition for 
the purposes of logic and corresponds to the character 
specific or generic of the natural historians indeed 
several of them as for instance linnaeus in his philoso 
plda botanica always call these characters the difference 
by a traditional application of the peripatetic terms of art 

of the other two words the property is that which 
though not employed in defining the class belongs to 
every part of itf it is what happens to all the class 
to it alone and at all times as to be capable of laughing 
is a property of a man 

the accident is that which may be present and absent 
without the destruction of the subject as to sleep is an 
accident a thing which happens to man 

i need not dwell further on this system of techni 
calities the most remarkable points in it are those 
which i have already noticed the doctrine of the succes 
sive subordination of genera and the fixing attention 
upon the specific difference these doctrines though 
invented in order to make reasoning more systematic 
and at a period anterior to the existence of any classifi 
catory science have by a curious contrast with the inten 
tions of their founders been of scarcely any use in sciences 
of reasoning but have been amply applied and developed

in the natural history which arose in later times we 
must now treat of the principles on which this science 
proceeds and explain what peculiar arid technical pro 
cesses it employs in addition to those of common thought 
and common language 



chapter ii 

the methods of natural history as regu 
lated by the idea of likeness 

 idea of likeness in natural history the various 
branches of natural history in so far as they are classi 
ficatory sciences merely and do not depend upon physio 
logical views rest upon the same idea of likeness which 
is the ground of the application of the names more or 
less general of common language but the nature of 
science requires that for her purposes this idea should be 
applied in a more exact and rigorous manner than in its 
common and popular employment just as occurs with 
regard to the other ideas on which science is founded 
for instance as the idea of space gives rise in popular use 
to the relations implied in the prepositions and adjectives 
which refer to position and form and in its scientific 
developement gives rise to the more precise relations of 
geometry 

the way in which the idea of likeness has been 
applied so as to lead to the construction of a science is 
best seen in botany for in the classification of animals 
we are inevitably guided by a consideration of the function 
of parts that is by an idea of purpose and not of like 
ness merely and in mineralogy the attempts at classifi 
cation on the principles of natural history have been 
hitherto very imperfectly successful but in botany we 
have an example of a branch of knowledge in which sys 



methods of natural history 

teiaatic classification has been effected with great beauty 
and advantage and in which the peculiarities and prin 
ciples on which such classification must depend have been 
carefully studied many of the principal botanists as 
linnaeus adanson decandolle have not only practically 
applied but have theoretically enunciated what they held 
to be the sound maxims of classificatory science and 
have thus enabled us to place before the reader with con 
fidence the philosophy of this kind of science 

 condition of its use we may begin by remarking 
that the idea of likeness in its systematic employment 
is governed by the same principle which we have already 
spoken of as regulating the distribution of things into 
kinds and the assignment of names in unsystematic 
thought and speech namely the condition that general 
propositions shall be possible but as in this case the pro 
positions are to f be of a scientific form and exactness the 
likeness must be treated with a corresponding precision 
and its consequences traced by steady and distinct pro 
cesses naturalists must for their purposes employ the 
resemblances of objects in a technical manner this tech 
nical process may be considered as consisting of three 
steps the fixation of the resemblances the use of 
them in making a classification the means of applying 
the classification these three steps may be spoken of as 
the terminology the plan of the system and the scheme 
of the characters 

 i terminology terminology signifies the col 
lection of terms or technical words which belong to the 
science but in fixing the meaning of the terms at 

 decandolle and others use the term glossology instead of termi 
nology to avoid the blemish of a word compounded of two parts taken 
from different languages the convenience of treating the termina 
tion ology and a few other parts of compounds as not restricted to 
greek combinations is so great that i shall venture in these cases to 
disregard this philological scruple 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

least of the descriptive terms we necessarily fix at the 
same time the perceptions and notions which the terms 
are to convey and thus the terminology of a classifica 
tory science exhibits the elements of its substance as 
well as of its language a large but indispensable part 
of the study of botany and of mineralogy and zoology 
also consists in the acquisition of the peculiar voca 
bulary of the science 

the meaning of technical terms can be fixed in the 
first instance only by convention and can be made intel 
ligible only by presenting to the senses that which the 
terms are to signify the knowledge of a colour by its 
name can only be taught through the eye no descrip 
tion can convey to a hearer what we mean by apple green 
or french grey it might perhaps be supposed that in 
the first example the term apple referring to so familiar 
an object sufficiently suggests the colour intended but 
it may easily be seen that this is not true for apples are 
of many different hues of green and it is only by a con 
ventional selection that we can appropriate the term to 
one special shade when this appropriation is once mad e 
the term refers to the sensation and not to the parts of 
the term for these enter into the compound merely as 
a help to the memory whether the suggestion be a 
natural connexion as in apple green or a casual one as in 
french grey in order to derive due advantage from 
technical terms of this kind they must be associated 
immediately with the perception to which they belong 
and not connected with it through the vague usages of 
common language the memory must retain the sensa 
tion and the technical word must be understood as 
directly as the most familiar word and more distinctly 
when we find such terms as tinwhite or pinchbeck 
brown the metallic colour so denoted ought to start up 
in our memory without delay or search 



methods of natural history 

this which it is most important to recollect with 
respect to the simpler properties of bodies as colour and 
form is no less true with respect to more compound 
notions in all cases the term is fixed to a peculiar 
meaning by convention and the student in order to use 
the word must be completely familiar with the conven 
tion so that he has no need to frame conjectures from 
the word itself such conjectures would always be inse 
cure and often erroneous thus the term papilionaceous 
applied to a flower is employed to indicate not only a re 
semblance to a butterfly but a resemblance arising from 
five petals of a certain peculiar shape and arrangement 
and even if the resemblance were much stronger than it 
is in such cases yet if it were produced in a different way 
as for example by one petal or two only instead of a 
 standard two wings and a keel consisting of two 
parts more or less united into one we should no longer 
be justified in speaking of it as a papilionaceous flower 

the formation of an exact and extensive descriptive 
language for botany has been executed with a degree of 
skill and felicity which before it was attained could 
hardly have been dreamt of as attainable every part of 
a plant has been named and the form of every part even 
the most minute has had a large assemblage of descrip 
tive terms appropriated to it by means of which the 
botanist can convey and receive knowledge of form and 
structure as exactly as if each minute part were pre 
sented to him vastly magnified this acquisition was 
part of the linnaean reform of which we have spoken in 
the history tournefort says decandolle appears to 
have been the first who really perceived the utility of fixing 
the sense of terms in such a way as always to employ the 
same word in the same sense and always to express the 
same idea by the same word but it was linnaeus who 

 theor elem p 
vol i h 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

really created and fixed this botanical language and 
this is his fairest claim to glory for by this fixation of 
language he has shed clearness and precision over all 
parts of the science 

it is not necessary here to give any detailed account 
of the terms of botany the fundamental ones have been 
gradually introduced as the parts of plants were more 
carefully and minutely examined thus the flower was 
successively distinguished into the calyx the corolla the 
stamens and the pistils the sections of the corolla were 
termed petals by columna those of the calyx were 
called sepals by necker sometimes terms of greater 
generality were devised as perianth to include the calyx 
and corolla whether one or both of these were present f 
pericarp for the part inclosing the grain of whatever kind 
it be fruit nut pod c and it may easily be imagined 
that descriptive terms may by definition and combination 
become very numerous and distinct thus leaves may be 
called pinnatifid pinnatipartite pinnatisect pinnatilobate 
palmatifid palmatipartite c and each of these words 
designates different combinations of the modes and extent 
of the divisions of the leaf with the divisions of its outline 
in some cases arbitrary numerical relations are introduced 
into the definition thus a leaf is called bilobatej when it 
is divided into two parts by a notch but if the notch go 
to the middle of its length it is bifid if it go near the 
base of the leaf it is bipartite if to the base it is bisect 
thus too a pod of a cruciferous plant is a silica if it be 
four times as long as it is broad but if it be shorter than 
this it is a silicula such terms being established the 
form of the very complex leaf or frond of a fern is exactly 
conveyed by the following phrase fronds rigid pinnate

pinnae recurved subunilateral pinnatifid the segments 
linear undivided or bifid spinulososerrate 

other characters as well as form are conveyed with 
the like precision colour by means of a classified scale 
of colours as we have seen in speaking of the measures 
of secondary qualities to which however we must add 
that the naturalist employs arbitrary names such as we 
have already quoted and not mere numerical exponents 
to indicate a certain number of selected colours this 
was done with most precision by werner and his scale 
of colours is still the most usual standard of naturalists 
werner also introduced a more exact terminology with 
regard to other characters which are important in mine 
ralogy as lustre hardness but mohs improved upon this 
step by giving a numerical scale of hardness in which 
talc is gypsum calc spar and so on as we have 
already explained in the history of mineralogy some 
properties as specific gravity by their definition give at 
once a numerical measure and others as crystalline 
form require a very considerable array of mathematical 
calculation and reasoning to point out their relations 
and gradations in all cases the features of likeness in 
the objects must be rightly apprehended in order to their 
being expressed by a distinct terminology thus no 
terms could describe crystals for any purpose of natural 
history till it was discovered that in a class of minerals 
the proportion of the faces might vary while the angle 
remained the same nor could crystals be described so 
as to distinguish species till it was found that the de 
rived and primitive forms are connected by very simple 
relations of space and number the discovery of the 
mode in which characters must be apprehended so that 
they may be considered w fixed for a class is an important

step in the progress of each branch of natural history 
and hence we have had in the history of mineralogy 
and botany to distinguish as important and eminent 
persons those who made such discoveries rome de 
lisle and hauy cesalpinus and gesner 

by the continued progress of that knowledge of 
minerals plants and other natural objects in which such 
persons made the most distinct and marked steps but 
which has been constantly advancing in a more gradual 
and imperceptible manner the most important and essen 
tial features of similarity and dissimilarity in such objects 
have been selected arranged and fitted with names and 
we have thus in such departments systems of terminology 
which fix our attention upon the resemblances which it 
is proper to consider and enable us to convey them in 
words we have now to speak of the mode in which 
such resemblances have been employed in the construc 
tion of a systematic classification 

 ii the plan of the system the collection of 
sound views and maxims by which the resemblances of 
natural objects are applied so as to form a scientific classi 
fication is a department of the philosophy of natural history 
which has been termed by some writers as decandolle 
taxonomy as containing the laws of the taxis arrange 
ment by some germans this has been denominated 
systematik if we could now form a new substantive after 
the analogy of the words logic rhetoric and the like 
we might call it systematic but though our english 
writers commonly use the expression systematical botany 
for the botany of classification they appear to prefer 
the term diatcuvis for the method of constructing the 
classification the rules of such a branch of science are 
curious and instructive 

in framing a classification of objects we must attend 
to their resemblances and differences but here the 
question occurs to ivhat resemblances and differences for 



methods of natural history 

a different selection of the points of resemblance would 
give different results a plant frequently agrees in leaves 
with one group of plants in flowers with another which 
set of characters are we to take as our guide 

the view already given of the regulative principle of 
all classification namely that it must enable us to assert 
true and general propositions will obviously occur as 
applicable here the object of a scientific classification 
is to enable us to enunciate scientific truths we must 
therefore classify according to those resemblances of 
objects plants or any others which bring to light such 
truths 

but this reply to the inquiry on what characters of 
resemblance we are to found our system is still too gene 
ral and vague to be satisfactory it carries us however as 
far as this that since the truths we are to attend to are 
scientific truths governed by precise and homogeneous 
relations we must not found our scientific classification on 
casual indefinite and unconnected considerations we 
must not for instance be satisfied with dividing plants 
as dioscorides does into aromatic esculent medicinal 
and vinous or even with the long prevalent distribution 
into trees shrubs and herbs since in these subdivisions 
there is no consistent principle 

 latent reference to natural affinity but there 
may be several kinds of truths all exact and coherent 
which may be discovered concerning plants or any other 
natural objects and if this should be the case our rule 
leaves us still at a loss in what manner our classification 
is to be constructed and historically speaking a much 
more serious inconvenience has been this that the task 
of classification of plants was necessarily performed when 
the general laws of their form and nature were very little 
known or rather when the existence of such laws was 
only just beginning to be discerned even up to the 
present day the general propositions which botanists are 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

able to assert concerning the structure and properties of 
plants are extremely imperfect and obscure 

we are thus led to this conclusion that the idea of 
likeness could not be applied so as to give rise to a scien 
tific classification of plants till considerable progress was 
made in studying the general relations of vegetable form 
and life and that the selection of the resemblances which 
should be taken into account must depend upon the 
nature of the relations which were then brought into view 

but this amounts to saying that in the consideration of 
the classification of vegetables other ideas must be called 
into action as well as the idea of likeness the new 
general views to which the more intimate study of plants 
leads must depend like all general truths upon some 
regulating idea which gives unity to scattered facts no 
progress could be made in botanical knowledge without 
the operation of such principles and such additional 
ideas must be employed besides those of mere likeness 
and unlikeness in order to point out that classification 
which has a real scientific value 

accordingly in the classificatory sciences ideas other 
than likeness do make their appearance such ideas 
in botany have influenced the progress of the science 
even before they have been clearly brought into view 
we have especially the idea of affinity which is the 
basis of all natural systems of classification and which 
we shall consider in a succeeding chapter the assump 
tion that there is a natural system an assumption made 
by all philosophical botanists implies a belief in the 
existence of natural affinity and is carried into effect by 
means of principles which are involved in that idea 
but as the formation of all systems of classification must 
involve in a great degree the idea of resemblance and 
difference i shall first consider the effect of that idea 
before i treat specially of natural affinity 

 natural classes many attempts were made to 



methods of natural history 

classify vegetables before the rules which govern a natural 
system were clearly apprehended botanists agreed in 
esteeming some characters as of more value than others 
before they had agreed upon any general rules or prin 
ciples for estimating the relative importance of the cha 
racters they were convinced of the necessity of adding 
other considerations to that of resemblance without see 
ing clearly what these ought to be they aimed at a 
natural classification without knowing distinctly in what 
manner it was to be natural 

the attempts to form natural classes therefore in the 
first part of their history belong to the idea of likeness 
though obscurely modified even from an earty period by 
the ideas of affinity and even of function and of deve 
lopement hence natural classes may to a certain 
extent be treated of in this place 

natural classes are opposed to artificial classes which 
are understood to be regulated by an assumed character 
yet no classes can be so absolutely artificial in this 
sense as to be framed upon characters arbitrarily as 
sumed for instance no one would speak of a class of 
shrubs defined by the circumstance of each having a 
hundred leaves for of such a class no assertion could be 
made and therefore the class could never come under our 
notice in what sense then are artificial classes to be 
understood as opposed to natural 

 artificial classes to this question the following 
is the answer when natural classes of a certain small 
extent have been formed a system may be devised which 
shall be regulated by a few selected characters and which 
shall not dissever these small natural classes but con 
form to them as far as they go if these selected 
characters be made absolute and imperative and if we 
abandon all attempt to obtain natural classes of any 
higher order and wider extent we form an artificial 
system 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

thus in the linneean system of botanical classifica 
tion it is assumed that certain natural groups namely 
species and genera are established it is conceived more 
over that the division of classes according to the number 
of stamens and of pistils does not violate the natural 
connexions of species and genera this arrangement 
according to the number of stamens and pistils further 
modified in certain cases by other considerations is then 
made the ground of all the higher divisions of plants and 
thus we have an artificial system 

it has been objected to this view that the linnsean 
artificial system does not in all cases respect the boun 
daries of genera but would if rigorously applied distribute 
the species of the same genus into different artificial 
classes it would divide for instance the genera vale 
riana geranium c to this we must reply that so 
far as the linnsean system does this it is an imperfect 
artificial system its great merit is in its making such a 
disjunction in comparatively so few cases and in the ar 
tificial characters being for the most part obvious and 
easily applied 

 are genera natural f it has been objected also 
that genera are not natural groups linnaeus asserts in 
the most positive manner that they aref on which 
adanson observes i know not how any botanist can 
maintain such a thesis that which is certain is that up 
to the present time no one has been able to prove it nor 
to give an exact definition of a natural genus but only of 
an artificial he then brings several arguments to con 
firm this view 

but we are to observe in answer to this that adan 
son improperly confounds the recognition of the existence 
of a natural group with the invention of a technical 
mark or definition of it genera are groups of species 

 decand th el p 
t piil jot art famille de ph pref cv 



methods of natural history 

associated in virtue of natural affinity of general resem 
blance of real propinquity of such groups certain 
selected characters one or few may usually be discovered 
by which the species may be referred to their groups 
these artificial characters do not constitute but indicate 
the genus they are the diagnosis not the basis of the 
diataxis and they are always subject to be rejected and 
to have others substituted for them when they violate 
the natural connexion of species which a minute and 
enlarged study discovers 

it is therefore no proof that genera are not natural 
to say that their artificial characters are different in dif 
ferent systems such characters are only different at 
tempts to confine the variety of nature within the limits 
of definition nor is it sufficient to say that these groups 
themselves are different in different writers that some 
botanists make genera what others make only species as 
pedicularis rhinanthus euphrasies antirrhinmi this 
discrepancy shows only that the natural arrangement is 
not yet completely known even in the smaller groups 
a conclusion to which we need not refuse our assent 
but in opposition to these negatives the manner in which 
genera have been established proves that they are regu 
lated by the principle of being natural and that alone 
for they are not formed according to any a priori rule 
the botanist does not take any selected or arbitrary part 
or parts of the plants and marshal his genera according 
to the differences of this part on the contrary the 
divisions of genera are sometimes made by means of the 
flower sometimes by means of the fruit the anthers 
the stamens the seeds the pericarp and the most varied 
features of these parts are used in the most miscellaneous 
and unsystematic manner linnaeus has indeed laid 
down a maxim that the characteristic differences of 

 adanson p cvi 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

genera must reside in the fructification but adanson 
has justly remarked f that an arbitrary restriction like 
this makes the groups artificial and that in some families 
other characters are more essential than those of the 
fructification as the leaves in the families of aparinea 
and leguminoscb and the disposition of the flowers in 
labiatce and naturalists are so far from thinking it 
sufficient to distribute species into genera by arbitrary 
marks that we find them in many cases lamenting the 
absence of good natural marks as in the families of 
umbelliferee where linnaeus declared that any one who 
could find good characters of genera would deserve great 
admiration and where it is only of late that good 
characters have been discovered and the arrangement 
settled by means principally of the ribs of the fruit j 

it is thus clear that genera are not established on any 
assumed or preconceived basis what then is the prin 
ciple which regulates botanists when they try to fix 
genera what is the arrangement which they thus wish 
for without being able to hit upon it what is the 
tendency which thus drives them from the corolla to the 
anthers from the flower to the fruit from the fructifica 
tion to the leaves it is plain that they seek something 
not of their own devising and creating not anything 
merely conventional and systematic but something which 
they conceive to exist in the relations of the plants 
themselves something which is without the mind not 
within in nature not in art in short a natural order 

thus the regulative principle of a genus or of any 
other natural group is that it is or is supposed to be 
natural and by reference to this principle as our guide

we shall be able to understand the meaning of that inde 
finiteness and indecision which we frequently find in the 
descriptions of such groups and which must appear so 
strange and inconsistent to any one who does not suppose 
these descriptions to assume any deeper ground of con 
nexion than an arbitrary choice of the botanist thus 
in the family of the rosetree we are told that the 
ovules are very rarely erect the stigmata usually simple 
of what use it might be asked can such loose accounts 
be to which the answer is that they are not inserted 
in order to distinguish the species but in order to 
describe the family and the total relations of the ovules 
and of the stigmata of the family are better known by 
this general statement a similar observation may be 
made with regard to the anomalies of each group which 
occur so commonly that mr lindley in his introduction 
to the natural system of botany makes the anomalies 
an article in each family thus part of the character of 
the rosaceae is that they have alternate stipulate leaves 
and that the albumen is obliterated but yet in lowea one 
of the genera of this family the stipulae are absent and 
the albumen is present in another neillia this implies 
as we have already seen that the artificial character or 
diagnosis as mr lindley calls it is imperfect it is 
though very nearly yet not exactly commensurate with 
the natural group and hence in certain cases this cha 
racter is made to yield to the general weight of natural 
affinities 

 difference of natural history and mathematics 
these views of classes determined by characters which 
cannot be expressed in words of propositions which 
state not what happens in all cases but only usually 
of particulars which are included in a class though they 
transgress the definition of it may very probably surprise

 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

the reader they are so contrary to many of the received 
opinions respecting the use of definitions and the nature 
of scientific propositions that they will probably appear 
to many persons highly illogical and unphilosophical 
but a disposition to such a judgment arises in a great 
measure from this that the mathematical and mathe 
maticophysical sciences have in a great degree deter 
mined mens views of the general nature and form of 
scientific truth while natural history has not yet had 
time or opportunity to exert its due influence upon the 
current habits of philosophizing the apparent indefi 
niteness and inconsistency of the classifications and 
definitions of natural history belongs in a far higher 
degree to all other except mathematical speculations 
and the modes in which approximations to exact distinc 
tions and general truths have been made in natural his 
tory may be worthy our attention even for the light they 
throw upon the best modes of pursuing truth of all kinds 
 natural groups given by type not by definition 
the further developement of this suggestion must be 
considered hereafter but we may here observe that 
though in a natural group of objects a definition can no 
longer be of any use as a regulative principle classes are 
not therefore left quite loose without any certain stand 
ard or guide the class is steadily fixed though not 
precisely limited it is given though not circumscribed 
it is determined not by a boundary line without but by a 
central point within not by what it strictly excludes 
but by what it eminently includes by an example not 
by a precept in short instead of definition we have a 
type for our director 

a type is an example of any class for instance a 
species of a genus which is considered as eminently pos 
sessing the characters of the class all the species 
which have a greater affinity with this typespecies than 



methods of natural history 

with any others form the genus and are ranged about 
it deviating from it in various directions and different 
degrees thus a genus may consist of several species 
which approach very near the type and of which the 
claim to a place with it is obvious while there may be 
other species which straggle further from this central 
knot and which yet are clearly more connected with it 
than with any other and even if there should be some 
species of which the place is dubious and which appear 
to be equally bound to two generic types it is easily seen 
that this would not destroy the reality of the generic 
groups any more than the scattered trees of the inter 
vening plain prevent our speaking intelligibly of the dis 
tinct forests of two separate hills 

the typespecies of every genus the typegenus of 
every family is then one which possesses all the cha 
racters and properties of the genus in a marked and pro 
minent manner the type of the rose family has alter 
nate stipulate leaves wants the albumen has the ovules 
not erect has the stigmata simple and besides these 
features which distinguish it from the exceptions or 
varieties of its class it has the features which make it 
prominent in its class it is one of those which possess 
clearly several leading attributes and thus though we 
cannot say of any one genus that it must be the type of 
the family or of any one species that it must be the type 
of the genus we are still not wholly to seek the type 
must be connected by many affinities with most of the 
others of its group it must be near the centre of the 
crowd and not one of the stragglers 

 it has already been repeatedly stated as the 
great rule of all classification that the classification must 
serve to assert general piopositions it may be asked 
what propositions we are able to enunciate by means of 
such classifications as we are now treating of and the 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

answer is that the collected knowledge of the characters 
habits properties organization and functions of these 
groups and families as it is found in the best botanical 
works and as it exists in the minds of the best botanists 
exhibits to us the propositions which constitute the 
science and to the expression of which the classification 
is to serve all that is not strictly definition that is all 
that is not artificial character in the descriptions of such 
classes is a statement of truths more or less general 
more or less precise but making up together the posi 
tive knowledge which constitutes the science as we 
have said the consideration of the properties of plants in 
order to form a system of classification has been termed 
taxonomy or the systematick of botany all the parts 
of the descriptions which taking the system for granted 
convey additional information are termed the physio 
graphy of the science and the same terms may be 
applied in the other branches of natural history 

 artificial and natural systems if i have suc 
ceeded in making it apparent that an artificial system of 
characters necessarily implies natural classes which are 
not severed by the artificial marks we shall now be 
able to compare the nature and objects of the artificial 
and natural systems points on which much has been 
written in recent times 

the artificial system is one which is or professes to 
be entirely founded upon marks selected according to the 
condition which has been stated of not violating certain 
narrow natural groups namely in the linnsean system 
the natural genera of plants the marks which form the 
basis of the system are applied rigorously and universally 
without any further regard to any other characters or in 
dications of affinity thus in the linnsean system which 
depends mainly on the number of male organs or stamens 
and on the number of female organs or styles the largest 



methods of natural history 

divisions or the classes are arranged according to the 
number of the stamens and are monandria diandria tri 
andria tetrandria pentandria hexandria and so on the 
names being formed of the greek numerical words and 
of the word which implies male and the orders of each 
of these classes are distinguished by the number of styles 
and are called mtpgyma digynia trigynia and so on 
the termination of these words meaning female and so 
far as this numerical division and subdivision go on the 
system is a rigorous system and strictly artificial 

but the condition that the artificial system shall leave 
certain natural affinities untouched makes it impossible 
to go through the vegetable kingdom by a method of 
mere numeration of stamens and styles the distinction 
of flowers with twenty and with thirty stamens is not a 
fixed distinction flowers of one and the same kind as roses 
have some fewer than the former some more than the 
latter number the artificial system therefore must be 
modified and there are various relations of connexion 
and proportion among the stamina which are more per 
manent and important than their mere number thus 
flowers with two longer and two shorter stamens are not 
placed in the class tetrandria but are made a separate 
class iidynamia those with four longer and two shorter 
are in like manner tetradynamia not hexandria those in 
which the filaments are bound into two bundles are dia 
delphia all these and other classes are deviations from 
the plan of the earlier classes and are so far defects of 
the artificial system but they are requisite in order that 
it may leave a basis of natural groups without which it 
would not be a system of vegetables and as the divi 
sion is still founded on some properties of the stamens 
it combines not ill with that part of the system which 
depends on the number the classes framed in virtue of 
these various considerations make up an artificial system 
which is tolerably coherent 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

but since the artificial system thus regards natural 
groups in what does it differ from a natural system 
it differs in this that though it allows certain subor 
dinate natural groups it merely allows these and does 
not endeavour to ascend to any wider natural groups 
it takes all the higher divisions of its scheme from its 
artificial characters its stamens and pistils without look 
ing to any natural affinities it accepts natural genera 
but it does not seek natural families or orders or classes 
it assumes natural groups but does not investigate any 
it forms wider and higher groups but professes to frame 
them arbitrarily 

but then on the other hand the question occurs 
this being the case what can be the use of the artificial 
system if its characters in the higher stages of clas 
sification be arbitrary how can it lead us to the natural 
relations of plants and the answer is that it does so 
in virtue of the original condition that there shall be 
certain natural relations which the artificial system shall 
not transgress and that its use arises from the facility 
with which we can follow the artificial arrangement as 
far as it goes we can count the stamens and pistils 
and thus we know the class and order of our plant and 
we have then to discover its genus and species by means 
less symmetrical but more natural the artificial sys 
tem though arbitrary in a certain degree brings us to a 
class in which the whole of each genus is contained and 
there we can find the proper genus by a suitable method 
of seeking no artificial system can conduct us into 
the extreme of detail but it can place us in a situation 
where the detail is within our reach we cannot find 
the house of a foreign friend by its latitude and longi 
tude but we may be enabled by a knowledge of the 
latitude and longitude to find the city in which he 
dwells or at least the island and we then can reach his 





methods of natural history 

abode by following the road or exploring the locality 
the artificial system is such a method of travelling by 
latitude and longitude the natural system is that which 
is guided by a knowledge of the country 

the natural system then is that which endeavours 
to arrange by the natural affinities of objects and more 
especially which attempts to ascend from the lower 
natural groups to the higher as for example from genera 
to natural families orders and classes but as we have 
already hinted these expressions of natural affinities 
natural groups and the like when considered in refer 
ence to the idea of resemblance alone without studying 
analogy or function are very vague and obscure we 
must notice some of the attempts which were made 
under the operation of this imperfect view of the subject 

 modes of framing natural systems decan 
dolle distinguishes the attempts at natural classifica 
tions into three sorts those of blind trial tatonnement 
those of general comparison and those of subordination of 
characters the two former do not depend distinctly 
upon any principle except resemblance the third refers 
us to other views and must be considered in a future 
chapter 

method of blind trial the notion of the existence 
of natural classes dependent on the general resemblance 
of plants of an affinity showing itself in different parts 
and various ways though necessarily somewhat vague 
and obscure was acted upon at an early period as we 
have seen in the formation of genera and was enunciated 
in general terms soon after thus magnoliusf says that 
he discerns in plants an affinity by means of which they 
may be arranged in families yet it is impossible to 

 th el art 

t dec th el art petri magnoli prodromus hist gen

vol i 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

obtain from the fructification alone the characters of these 
families and i have therefore chosen those parts of 
plants in which the principal characteristic marks are 
found as the root the stem the flower the seed in 
some plants there is even a certain resemblance an 
affinity which does not consist in the parts considered 
separately but in their totality an affinity which may be 
felt but not expressed as we see in the families of agri 
monies and cinquefoils which every botanist will judge 
to be related though they differ by their roots their 
leaves their flowers and their seeds 

this obscure feeling of a resemblance on the whole 
an affinity of an indefinite kind appears fifty years later 
in linnseuss attempts in the natural classification 
he says no a priori rule can be admitted no part of 
the fructification can be taken exclusively into considera 
tion but only the simple symmetry of all its parts 
hence though he proposed natural families and even 
stated the formation of such families to be the first and 
last object of all methods he never gave the characters 
of those groups or connected them by any method he 
even declared it to be impossible to lay down such a 
system of characters this persuasion was the result of 
his having refused to admit into his mind any idea more 
profound than that notion of resemblance of which he 
had made so much and such successful use he would not 
attempt to unravel the ideas of symmetry and of function 
on which the clear establishment of natural relations 
must depend he even despised the study of the inner 
organization of plants and reckoned f the anatomici who 
studied the anatomy and physiology of plants and the 
laws of vegetation among the botanophili the mere 
amateurs of his science 

the same notion of general resemblance and affinity 

 dec th el art t phil sot s

accompanied with the same vagueness is to be found in 
the writer who least participated in the general admiration 
of linnaeus buffon though it was in a great measure 
his love of higher views which made him dislike what 
he considered the pedantry of the swedish school he 
does not seem to have obtained a clearer sight of the 
principle of the natural method than his rival except 
that he did not restrict his characters to the fructification 
things must be arranged by their resemblances and dif 
ferences he says in but the resemblances and 
differences must be taken not from one part but from the 
whole and we must attend to the form the size the 
habit the number and position of the parts even the 
substance of the part and we must make use of these 
elements in greater or smaller number as we have need 
 method of general comparison a countryman 
of buffon who shared with him his depreciating esti 
mate of the linnsean system and his wish to found a 
natural system upon a broader basis was adanson and 
he invented an ingenious method of apparently avoid 
ing the vagueness of the practice of following the general 
feeling of resemblance this method consisted in making 
many artificial systems in each of which plants were 
arranged by some one part and then collecting those 
plants which came near each other in the greatest number 
of those artificial systems as plants naturally the most 
related adanson gives an account f of the manner in 
which this system arose in his mind he had gone to 
senegal animated by an intense zeal for natural history 
and there amid the luxuriant vegetation of the torrid 
zone he found that the methods of linnaeus and tourne 
fort failed him altogether as means of arranging his 
new botanical treasures he was driven to seek a new 

 adanson p clvi buffon hist nat t i p

 i 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

system for this purpose he says i examined 
plants in all their parts without omitting any from the 
roots to the embryo the folding of the leaves in the bud 
their mode of sheathing the situation and folding of 
the embryo and of its radicle in the seed relatively to 
the fruit in short a number of particulars which few 
botanists notice i made in the first place a complete 
description of each plant putting each of its parts in 
separate articles in all its details when new species 
occurred i put down the points in which they differed 
omitting those in which they agreed by means of the 
aggregate of these comparative descriptions i perceived 
that plants arranged themselves into classes or families 
which could not be artificial or arbitrary not being 
founded upon one or two parts which might change at 
certain limits but on all the parts so that the dispropor 
tion of one of these parts was corrected and balanced 
by the introduction of another thus the principle of 
resemblance was to suffice for the general arrangement 
not by means of a new principle as symmetry or organi 
zation which should regulate its application but by a 
numeration of the peculiarities in which the resemblance 
consisted 

the labour which adanson underwent in the execu 
tion of this thought was immense by taking each 
organ and considering its situation figure number c 
he framed sixtyfive artificial systems and collected his 
natural families by a numerical combination of these 
for example his sixtyfifth artificial system f is that which 
depends upon the situation of the ovary with regard to 
the flower according to this system he frames ten artifi 
cial classes including ninetythree sections and of these 
sections the resulting natural arrangement retains thirty 
five above onethird the same estimate is applied in 
other cases

but this attempt to make number supply the defects 
which the vague notion of resemblance introduces how 
ever ingenious must end in failure for as decan 
dolle observes it supposes that we know not only all the 
organs of plants but all the points of view in which it is 
possible to consider them and even if this assumption 
were true which it is and long must be very far from 
being the principle is altogether vicious for it supposes 
that all these points of view and all the resulting artificial 
systems are of equal importance a supposition mani 
festly erroneous we are thus led back to the conside 
ration of the relative importance of organs and their 
qualities as a basis for the classification of plants which 
no artificial method can supersede and thus we find the 
necessity of attending to something besides mere external 
and detached resemblance the method of general com 
parison cannot any more than the method of blind trial 
lead us with any certainty or clearness to the natural 
method adansons families are held by the best botanists 
to be for the greater part natural but his hypotheses are 
unfounded and his success is probably more due to the 
dim feeling of affinity by which he was unconsciously 
guided than to the help he derived from his numerical 
processes 

 in a succeeding chapter i shall treat of that 
natural affinity on which a natural system must really 
be founded but before proceeding to this higher subject 
we must say a few words on some of the other parts of 
the philosophy of natural history the gradation of 
groups the nomenclature the diagnosis and the appli 
cation of the methods to other subjects 

gradation of groups it has been already noticed 
last chapter that even that vague application of the 
idea of resemblance which gives rise to the terms of 

 dec jwp 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

common language introduces a subordination of classes 
as man animal body substance such a subordination 
appears in a more precise form when we employ this 
idea in a scientific manner as we do in natural history 
we have then a series of divisions each inclusive of the 
lower ones which are expressed by various metaphors in 
different writers thus some have gone as far as eight 
terms of the series and have taken for the most part 
military names for them as hosts legions phalanges 
centuries cohorts sections genera species but the 
most received series is classes orders genera and 
species in which however we often have other terms 
interpolated as subgenera or sections of genera the 
expressions family and tribe are commonly appropriated 
to natural groups and we speak of the vegetable ani 
mal mineral kingdom but the other metaphors of pro 
vinces districts c which this suggests have not 
been commonly used 

it will of course be understood that each ascending 
step of classification is deduced by the same process from 
the one below a genus is a collection of species which 
resemble each other more than they resemble other spe 
cies an order is a collection of genera having in like 
manner the first degree of resemblance and so on 
what the degrees of resemblance are much depend upon 
the nature of the objects compared and cannot possibly 
be prescribed beforehand hence the same term class 
and order for instance may imply in different provinces 
of nature very different degrees of resemblance the 
classes of animals are insects birds fish beasts c 
the orders of beasts are ruminants tardigrades plan 
tigrades c the two classes of plants according to 
the natural orderf are vascular and cellular the 
latter having neither sexes flowers nor spiral vessels 
 adakson p cvi t j indley 



methods of natural history 

the vascular plants are divided into orders as umlelli 
fercs ranunculacecb c but between this class and 
its orders are interposed two other steps two sub 
classes dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous and two 
tribes of each angiospermie gymnospermice of the 
first and petaloidece glumacice of the second such 
interpolations are modifications of the general formula of 
subordination for the purpose of accommodating it to 
the most prominent natural affinities 

 species as we have already seen in tracing the 
principles of the natural method when by the intimate 
study of plants we seek to give fixity and definiteness to 
the notion of resemblance and affinity on which all these 
divisions depend we are led to the study of organization 
and analogy but we make a reference to physio 
logical conditions even from the first with regard to the 
lowest step of our arrangement the species for we 
consider it a proof of the impropriety of separating two 
species if it be shown that they can by any course of 
propagation culture and treatment the one pass into 
the other it is in this way for example that it has 
been supposed to be established that the common prim 
rose oxlip polyanthus and cowslip are all the same 
species plants which thus in virtue of external cir 
cumstances as soil exposure climate exhibit differences 
which may disappear by changing the circumstances 
are called varieties of the species and thus we cannot 
say that a species is a collection of individuals which 
possess the first degree of resemblance for it is clear 
that a primrose resembles another primrose more than it 
does a cowslip but this resemblance only constitutes a 
variety and we find that we must necessarily include in 
our conception of species the notion of propagation from 
the same stock and thus a species has been well de 
fined the collection of the individuals descended from 
 cuv regne animal p 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

one another or from common parents and of those which 
resemble these as much as these resemble each other 
and thus the sexual doctrine of plants or rather the 
consideration of them as things which propagate their 
kind whether by seed shoot or in any other way is 
at the basis of our classifications 

 the first degree of resemblance among organized 
beings is thus that which depends on this relation of 
generation and we might expect that the groups which 
are connected by this relation would derive their names 
from the notion of generation it is curious that both in 
greek and latin languages and in our own the words 
which have this origin yevos genus kind do not in the 
phraseology of science at least denote the nearest degree 
of relationship but have other terms subordinate to them 
which appear etymologically to indicate a mere resem 
blance of appearance elsos species sort and which are 
appropriated to the groups resulting from propagation 
probably the reason of this is that the former terms had 
been applied so widely and loosely before the scientific 
fixation of terms that to confine them to what we call 
species would have been to restrict them in a manner too 
unusual to be convenient 

 varieties races the species as we have said is 
the collection of individuals which resemble each other as 
much as do the offspring of a common stock but within 
the limits of this boundary there are often observable 
differences permanent enough to attract our notice though 
capable of being obliterated by mixture in the course of 
generation such different groups are called varieties 
thus the primrose and cowslip as has been stated above 
are found to be varieties of the same plant the poodle 
and the greyhound are well marked varieties of the 
species dog such differences are hereditary and as we 
have seen it may be long doubtful whether such here 



methods of natural history 

ditary differences are varieties only or different species 
in such cases the term race has been applied 

 iii nomenclature the nomenclature of any 
branch of natural history is the collection of names of all 
its species which when they become extremely numer 
ous requires some artifice to make it possible to recollect 
or apply them the known species of plants for example 
were at the time of linnoeus and are now probably 
 it would be useless to endeavour to frame and 
employ separate names for each of these species 

the division of the objects into a subordinated system 
of classification enables us to introduce a nomenclature 
which does not require this enormous number of names 
the artifice employed to avoid this inconvenience is to 
name a species by means of two or it might be more 
steps of the successive division thus in botany each of 
the genera has its name and the species are marked by 
the addition of some epithet to the name of the genus 
in this manner about generic names with a mo 
derate number of specific names were found by linnaeus 
sufficient to designate with precision all the species of 
vegetables known at his time and this binary method 
of nomenclature has been found so convenient that it 
has been universally adopted in every other department 
of the natural history of organized beings 

many other modes of nomenclature have been tried 
but no other has at all taken root linnaus himself 
appears at first to have intended marking each species by 
the generic name accompanied by a characteristic descrip 
tive phrase and to have proposed the employment of a 
trivial specific name as he termed it only as a method of 
occasional convenience the use of these trivial names 
has however become universal as we have said and is 
by many persons considered the greatest improvement 
introduced at the linneean reform 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

both linnaeus and other writers as a dan son have 
given many maxims with a view of regulating the selec 
tion of generic and specific names the maxims of 
linnaeus were intended as much as possible to exclude 
barbarism and confusion and have upon the whole been 
generally adopted though many of them were objected 
to by his contemporaries adanson and others as 
capricious or unnecessary innovations many of the 
names introduced by linnaeus certainly appear fanciful 
enough thus he gives the name of bauhinia to a plant 
with leaves in pairs because the bauhins were a pair of 
brothers banisteria is the name of a climbing plant in 
honour of banister who travelled among mountains 
but such names once established by adequate authority 
lose all their inconvenience and easily become permanent 
and hence the reasonableness of the linnaean rulef that 
as such a perpetuation of the names of persons by the 
names of plants is the only honour botanists have to 
bestow it ought to be used with care and caution 

the generic name must as linnaeus says be fixed 
before we attempt to form a specific name the latter 
without the former is like the clapper without the bell 
the name of the genus being established the species may 
be marked by adding to it a single word taken at will 
from any quarter that is not involving a description or 
any essential property of the plant but a casual or 
arbitrary appellation thus the various species of hiera 
cium are hieradum alpinwn h halleri h pilosetta 
h dubium h murorum c where we see how different 
may be the kind of origin of the words 

attempts have been made at various times to form 
the names of species from those of genera in some more

methods of natural history 

symmetrical manner thus some have numbered the 
species of genus c but this method is liable to 
the inconveniences first that it offers nothing for the 
memory to take hold of and second that if a new 
species intermediate between and and c be 
discovered it cannot be put in its place it has also 
been proposed to mark the species by altering the termi 
nation of the genus thus adanson denoting a genus 
by the name fonna lyclmidea conceived he might 
mark five of its species by altering the last vowel fonna 
fonnac fonnai fonnao fonnau then others by 
fonnaba fonnaka and so on this course would be 
liable to the same evils which have been noticed as 
belonging to the numerical method 

the names of plants and the same is true of animals 
have in common practice been binary only consisting of 
a generic and a specific name the class and order 
have not been admitted to form part of the appellation of 
the species indeed it is easy to see that a name which 
must be identical in so many instances as that of an 
order would be would be felt as superfluous and burden 
some accordingly linnaeus makes it a preceptf that 
the name of the class and the order must not be ex 
pressed but understood and hence he says royen who 
took lilium for the name of a class rightly rejected it as 
a generic name and substituted lirium with the greek 
termination 

yet we must not too peremptorily assume such 
maxims as these to be universal for all classificatory 
sciences it is very possible that it may be found 
advisable to use three terms that of order genus and 
species in designating minerals as is done in mohss 
nomenclature for example rhombohedral cole haloide 
paratomous hal baryte it is possible also that it may 

 pref clxxvi f phil bot sec 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

be found useful in the same science to mark some of the 
steps of classification by the termination 

thus it has been proposed to confine the termination 
ite to the order silicides of naumann as apophyllzfc 
stilbefc leuczte c and to use names of different form 
in other orders as talc spar for brennerite pyramidal 
titanium oxide for octahedrite some such method 
appears to be the most likely to give us a tolerable 
mineralogical nomenclature 

 iv diagnosis german naturalists speak of a 
part of the general method which they call the character 
istic of natural history and which is distinguished from 
the systematik of the science the systematick arranges 
the objects by means of all their resemblances the cha 
racteristick enables us to detect their place in the arrange 
ment by means of a few of their characters what these 
characters are to be must be discovered by observation 
of the groups and divisions of the system when they are 
formed to construct a collection of such as shall be 
clear and fixed is a useful and generally a difficult task 
for there is usually no apparent connexion between the 
marks which are used in discriminating the groups and 
the nature of the groups themselves they are assumed 
only because the naturalist extensively and exactly 
acquainted with the groups and the properties of the 
objects which compose them sees by a survey of the field 
that these marks divide it properly 

the characteristick has been termed by some english 
botanists the diagnosis of plants a word which we may 
conveniently adopt the diagnosis of any genus or 
species is different according to the system we follow 
thus in the linnoean system the diagnosis of the rose is 
in the first place given by its class and order it is icosan 
drous and polygynous and then the generic distinction 
is that the calyx is fivecleft the tube urceolate including 



methods of natural history 

many hairy aclienia the receptacle villous in the 
natural system the rosetribe are distinguished as 
beingf polypetalous dicotyledons with lateral styles 
superior simple ovaria regular perigynous stamens ex 
albuminous definite seeds and alternate stipulate leaves 
and the true roses are further distinguished by having 
 nuts numerous hairy terminated by the persistent 
lateral style and inclosed within the fleshy tube of the 
calyx c 

it will be observed that in a rigorous artificial system 
the systematick coincides with the ciaractenstick the 
diataxis with the diagnosis the reason why a plant is 
put in a division is identical with the mode by which it is 
known to be in the division the rose is in the class 
icosandria because it has many stamens inserted in the 
calyx and when we see such a set of stamens we imme 
diately know the class but this is not the case with 
the diagnosis of natural families thus the genera za 
mium and galeopsis dead nettle and hemp nettle are 
each formed into a separate group in virtue of their 
general resemblances and differences and not because the 
former has one tooth on each side of the lower lip and 
the latter a notch in its upper lip though they are dis 
tinguished by these marks 

thus so far as our systems are natural which as we 
have shown all systems to a certain extent must be the 
characteristick is distinct both from a natural and an 
artificial system and is in fact an artificial key to a 
natural system as being artificial it takes as few 
characters as possible as being natural its characters 
are not selected by any general or prescribed rule but 
follow the natural affinities the botanists who have 
made any steps in the formation of a natural method of 
plants since linnaus have all attempted to give a diag 
nosis corresponding to the diataxis of their method

chapter iii 

application of the natural history 
method to mineralogy 

 the philosophy of the sciences of classification has 
had great light thrown upon it by discussions concerning 
the methods which are used in botany for that science 
is one of the most complete examples which can be con 
ceived of the consistent and successful application of the 
principles and ideas of classification and this application 
has been made in general without giving rise to any very 
startling paradoxes or disclosing any insurmountable 
difficulties but the discussions concerning methods of 
mineralogical classification have been instructive for 
quite a different reason they have brought into view the 
boundaries and the difficulties of the process of classifi 
cation and have presented examples in which every 
possible mode of classifying appeared to involve inex 
tricable contradictions i will notice some of the points 
of this kind which demand our attention referring to the 
works published recently by several mineralogists 

in the history of mineralogy we noticed the attempt 
ipaade by mohs and other germans to apply to minerals 
a method of arrangement similar to that which has been 
so successfully employed for plants the survey which 
we have now taken of the grounds of that method will 
point out some of the reasons of the very imperfect 
success of this attempt we have already said that the 
terminology of mineralogy was materially reformed by 
werner and including in this branch of the subject as 
we must do the crystallography of later writers it may 
be considered as to a great extent complete of the 
attempts at a natural arrangement that of mohs appears 



application to mineralogy 

to proceed by the method of blind trial the undefinable 
perception of relationship by which the earliest attempts 
at a natural arrangement of plants were made breit 
haupt however has made though i do not know that he 
has published an essay in a mode which corresponds very 
nearly to adan sons process of multiplied comparisons 
having ascertained the specific gravity and hardness of 
all the species of minerals he arranged them in a table 
representing by two lines at right angles to each other 
these two numerical quantities thus all minerals were 
distributed according to two coordinates representing 
specific gravity and hardness he conceived that the 
groups which were thus brought together were natural 
groups on both these methods and on all similar ones 
we might observe that in minerals as in plants the mere 
general notion of likeness cannot lead us to a real arrange 
ment it requires to have precision and aim given it by 
some other relation the relation of chemical composi 
tion in minerals as the relation of organic function in 
vegetables the physical and crystallographical properties 
of minerals must be studied with reference to their con 
stitution and they must be arranged into groups which 
have some common chemical character before we can 
consider any advance as made towards a natural arrange 
ment 

in reality it happens in mineralogy as it happened in 
botany that those speculators are regulated by an obscure 
perception of this ulterior relation who do not profess to 
be regulated by it several of the orders of mohs have 
really great unity of chemical character and thus have 
good evidence of their being really natural orders 

 supposing the diataxis of minerals thus obtained 
mohs attempted the diagnosis and his characteristick of 
the mineral kingdom published at dresden in was 
the first public indication of his having constructed a 



 philosophy of the classipicatory sciences 

 

system from the nature of a characteristic it is neces 
sarily brief and without any ostensible principle but its 
importance was duly appreciated by the authors country 
men since that time many attempts have been made 
at improved arrangements of minerals but none i think 
except perhaps that of breithaupt professing to pro 
ceed rigorously on the principles of natural history to 
arrange by means of external characters neglecting alto 
gether or rather postponing the consideration of chemical 
properties by relaxing from this rigour however and 
by combining physical and chemical considerations 
arrangements have been obtained for example that of 
naumann which appear more likely than the one of mohs 
to be approximations to an ultimate really natural system 
naumanns classes are hydrolytes hcdoides silicides 
metal oxides metals sidphurides anthracides with sub 
divisions of orders as anhydrous wimetallic silicides 
it may be remarked that the designations of these are 
mostly chemical as we have observed already che 
mistry and mineralogy in its largest sense are each the 
necessary supplement of the other if chemistry furnish 
the nomenclature mineralogy must supply the physio 
graphy if the arrangement be founded on external 
characters and the names independent of chemistry the 
chemical composition of each species is an important 
scientific truth respecting it 

 the inquiry may actually occur whether any sub 
ordination of groups in the mineral kingdom has really 
been made out the ancient chemical arrangements 
for instance that of haiiy though professing to distribute 
minerals according to classes orders genera and species 
were not only arbitrary but inapplicable for the first 
postulate of any method that the species should have 
constant characters of unity and difference was not 
satisfied it was not ascertained that carbonate of lime 



application to mineralogy 

was really distinguishable in all cases from carbonate of 
magnesia or of iron yet these species were placed in re 
mote parts of the system and the above carbonates made 
just so many species although if distinct from one another 
at all they were further distinguishable into additional spe 
cies even now we may perhaps say that the limits of 
mineralogical species and their laws of fixity are not yet 
clearly seen for the discovery of the isomorphous rela 
tions and optical properties of minerals have rather shown 
us in what direction the object lies than led us to the goal 
it is clear that in the mineral kingdom the definition of 
species borrowed from the laws of the continuation of 
the kind which holds throughout the organic world fails 
us altogether and must be replaced by some other con 
dition nor is it difficult to see that the definite atomic 
relations of the chemical constituents and the definite 
crystalline angle must supply the principles of the specific 
identity for minerals yet the exact limits for the defi 
uiteness in both these cases when we admit the effect of 
mechanical mixtures c have not yet been completely 
disentangled it is clear that any arbitrary assumption 
as the allowance of a certain per centage of mixture or 
a certain small deviation in the angle is altogether con 
trary to the philosophy of the natural system and can 
lead to no stable views it is only by laborious exten 
sive and minute research that we can hope to attain to 
any solid basis of arrangement 

 still though there are many doubts respecting 
mineralogical species a large number of such species are 
so far fixed that they may be supposed capable of being 
united under the higher divisions of a system with approxi 
mate truth of these higher divisions those which have 
been termed orders appear to tend to something like a 
fixed chemical character thus the haloids of naumann 
and mostly those of mohsare combinations of an oxide with 
vol i k 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

an acid and thus resemble salts whence their name the 
silicides contain most of mohss spatis and the orders 
pyrites glance and blende are common to naumann 
and mohs being established by the latter on a difference 
of external character which difference is indeed very 
manifest and being included by the former in one che 
mical class sulpmrides the distinctions of hydrous 
and anhydrous metallic and unmetallic are of course 
chemical distinctions but occur as the differences of 
orders in naumanns mixed system 

we may observe that some french writers following 
haiiys last edition use instead of metallic and unmetallic 
autopside metallic and heteropside metallic meaning by this 
phraseology to acknowledge the discovery that earths c 
are metallic though they do not appear to be so while 
metals both are and appear metallic but this seems to 
be a refinement not only useless but absurd for what is 
gained by adding the word metallic which is common to 
all and therefore makes no distinction if certain metals 
are distinguished by their appearing to be metals this 
appearance is a reason for giving them the peculiar name 
metals nothing is gained by first bringing earths and 
metals together and then immediately separating them 
again by new and inconvenient names no proposition 
can be expressed better by calling earths heteropside metal 
lie substances and therefore such nomenclature is to be 
rejected 

granting then that the orders of the best recent mine 
ralogical systems approximate to natural groups we are led 
to ask whether the same can be said of the genera of the 
natural history systems such as those of mohs and breit 
haupt and here i must confess that i see no principle 
in these genera and have failed to apprehend the concep 
tions by the application of which they have been con 
structed i shall therefore not pass any further judgment 



application to mineralogy 

upon them the subordination of mineralogical species 
to orders is a manifest gain to science in the interposi 
tion of genera i see nothing but a source of confusion 

 in mineralogy as in other branches of natural 
history a reformed arrangement ought to give rise to a 
reformed nomenclature and for this there is more occa 
sion at present in mineralogy than there was in botany 
at the worst period at least as far as the extent of the 
subject allows the characters of minerals are much 
more dimly and unfrequently developed than those of 
plants hence arbitrary chemical arrangements which 
could not lead to any natural groups and therefore not to 
any good names prevailed till recently and this state of 
things produced an anarchy in which every man did what 
seemed right in his own eyes proposed species without 
any ascertained distinction and without a thought of 
subordination and gave them arbitrary names and thus 
with only about two or three hundred known species we 
have thousands upon thousands of names of anomalous 
form and uncertain application 

mohs has attempted to reform the nomenclature of 
the subject in a mode consistent with his attempt to 
reform the system in doing this he has fatally trans 
gressed a rule always insisted upon by the legislators of 
botany of altering usual names as little as possible and 
his names are both so novel and so cumbrous that they 
appear to have little chance of permanent currency they 
are perhaps more unwieldy than they need to be by 
referring as we have said to three of the steps of his 
classification the species genus and order we may 
however assert confidently from the whole analogy of 
natural history that no good names can be found which 
do not refer to at least two terms of the arrangement 
this rule has been practically adopted to a great extent 
by naumann who gives to most of his haloids the name 

 k 



 philosophy of the classificatoey sciences 

spar as calc spar iron spar c to all his oxides the 
terminal word erz ore and to the species of the orders 
kies pyrites glance and blende these names it has 
also been theoretically assented to by beudant who pro 
poses that we should say silicate stilbite silicate chabasie 
carbonate calcaire carbonate witherite sulphate couperose 
c one great difficulty in this case would arise from 
the great number of silicides it is not likely that any 
names would obtain a footing which tacked the term 
silicide to another word for each of these species the 
artifice which i have proposed in order to obviate this 
difficulty is that we should make the names of the sili 
cides and those alone end in lie or lite which a large 
proportion of them do already 

by this and a few similar contrivances we might 
i conceive without any inconvenient change introduce 
into mineralogy a systematic nomenclature 

 i shall now proceed to make a few remarks on a 
work on mineralogy more recent than those which i have 
above noticed and written with express reference to such 
difficulties as i have been discussing i allude to the 
treatise of m necker le regne mineral ramene aux 
methodes dhistoirenaturelle which also contains various 
dissertations on the philosophy of classification in general 
and its application to mineralogy in particular 

m necker remarks very justly that mineralogy as it 
has hitherto been treated differs from all other branches 
of natural history in this that while it is invested 
with all the forms of the sciences of classification 
classes divisions genera and the like the properties of 
those bodies to which the mineral ogical students atten 
tion is directed have no bearing whatever on the classi 
fication a person he remarks f might be perfectly 
well acquainted with all the characters of minerals which 

 paris regne mineral p 



application to mineralogy 

werner or haiiy examined so carefully and might yet be 
quite unable to assign to any mineral its place in the 
divisions of their methods there is a complete sepa 
ration between the study of mineralogical characters and 
the recognition of the name and systematic place of a 
mineral those who know mineralogy well may know 
minerals ill or hardly at all the systematist may be in 
such knowledge vastly inferior to the mineraldealer or 
the miner in this respect there is a complete contrast 
between this science and other classificatory sciences 

again in the bestknown systems of mineralogy as 
those of werner and haiiy the bodies which are 
grouped together as belonging to the same division have 
not as they have in other classificatory sciences any 
resemblance the different members of the larger classes 
are united by the common possession of some abstract 
property as that they all contain iron this is a pro 
perty to which no common circumstance in the bodies 
themselves corresponds what is there common to the 
minerals named oxidulous iron sulphuret of iron car 
bonate of iron sulphate of iron except that they all 
contain iron and when we have classed these bodies 
together what general assertion can we make concerning 
them except that which is the ground of our classifica 
tion that they contain iron they have nothing in 
common with iron or with each other in any other way 

again as these classes have no general properties all 
the properties are particular to the species and the 
descriptions of these necessarily become both tediously 
long and inconveniently insulated 

 these inconveniences arise from making chemical 
composition the basis of mineralogical classification with 
out giving chemical analysis the first place among mineral 
properties shall we then correct this omission so far 
 regne mineral p 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

as it has affected mineralogical systems shall we teach 
the student the chemical analysis of minerals and then 
direct him to classify them according to the results of his 
analysis 

but why should we do this to what purpose or on 
what ground do we arrange the results of chemical ana 
lysis according to the forms and subordination of natural 
history is not chemistry a science distinct from natural 
history are not the sciences opposed is not natural 
history confined to organic bodies can mere chemical 
elements and their combinations be with any propriety 
or consistency arranged into species genera and fami 
lies what is the principle on which genera and species 
depend do not species imply individuals what is 
an individual in the case of a chemical substance 

 we thus find some of the widest and deepest 
questions of the philosophy of classification brought under 
our consideration when we would provide a method for 
the classification of minerals the answers to these ques 
tions are given by m necker and i shall state some of 
his opinions taking the liberty of adding such remarks 
as are suggested by referring the subject to those prin 
ciples which have already been established in this work 

m necker asserts f that the distinctions of different 
sciences depend not on the objects they consider but on 
the different and independent points of view on which 
they proceed each science has its logic that is its 
mode of applying the general rules of human reason to 
its own special case it has been said by some that in 
minerals natural history and chemistry contemplate com 
mon objects and thus form a single science but do 
chemistry and natural history consider minerals in the 
same point of view 

 regne mineral p t p 

t ft p 



application to mineralogy 

the answer is that they do not physics and che 
mistry consider the properties of bodies in an abstract 
manner as their composition their elements their mu 
tual actions with the laws of these their forces as 
attraction affinity all which objects are abstract ideas 
in these cases we have nothing to do with bodies them 
selves but as the vehicles of the powers and properties 
which we contemplate 

 natural history on the other hand has to do with 
natural bodies their properties are not considered ab 
stractedly but only as characters if the properties are 
abstracted it is but for a moment natural history has to 
describe and class bodies as they are all which cannot 
be perceived by the senses belongs not to its domain as 
molecules atoms elements 

natural history may have recourse to physics or 
chemistry in order to recognise those properties of bodies 
which serve as characters but natural history is not on 
that account physics or chemistry classification is the 
essential business of the natural historianf to which 
task chemistry and physics are only instrumental and 
the further account of properties only complementary 

it has been said in support of the doctrine that 
chemistry and mineralogy are identical that chemistry 
does not neglect external characters the chemist in 
describing sulphur mentions its colour taste odour hard 
ness transparence crystalline form specific gravity how 
does he then differ from the mineralogist but to this 
it is replied that these notices of the external characters 
of this or any substance are introduced in chemistry 
merely as convenient marks of recognition whereas they 
are essential in mineralogy if we had taken the account 
given of several substances instead of one we should 
have seen that the chemist and the naturalist consider 

 reyne mineral p t p 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

them in ways altogether different the chemist will 
make it his business to discover the mutual action of the 
substances he will combine them form new products 
determine the proportions of the elements the minera 
logist will divide the substances into groups according 
to their properties and then subdivide these groups till he 
refers each substance to its species exterior and phy 
sical characters are merely accessory and subordinate for 
the chemist chemistry is merely instrumental for the 
mineralogist 

this view agrees with that to which we have been led 
by our previous reasonings and may according to our prin 
ciples be expressed briefly by saying that the idea which 
chemistry has to apply is the idea of elementary composi 
tion while natural history applies the idea of graduated 
resemblances and thus performs the task of classification 

 the question occurs whether natural history 
can be applied to inorganic substances and the answer 
to this question is that it can be applied if there are 
such things as inorganic individuals since the resem 
blances and differences with which natural history has to 
do are the resemblances and differences of individuals 

what is an individual it certainly is not that 
which is so simple that it cannot be divided individual 
animals are composed of many parts but if we exa 
mine we shall find that our idea of an individual is that 
it is a whole composed of parts which are not similar to 
the whole and have not an independent existence while 
the whole has an independent existence and a definite 
form f 

what then is the mineralogical individual at first 
while minerals were studied for their use the most pre 
cious of the substances which they contained was looked 
upon as the characteristic of the mineral the smallest 

 regne mineral t p t p 



application to mineralogy 

trace of silver made a mineral an ore of silver thus 
forms and properties were disregarded and substance was 
considered as identical with mineral and hence dau 
benton refused to recognise species in the mineral king 
dom because he recognised no individuals he proposed 
to call sorts what we call species in this way of con 
sidering minerals there are no individuals 

 but still this is not satisfactory for if we take a well 
formed and distinct crystal this clearly is an individual 

it may be objected that the crystal is divisible ac 
cording to the theory of crystallography into smaller 
solids that these small solids are really the simple ob 
jects and that actual crystals are formed by combinations 
of these molecules according to certain laws 

but as we have already said an individual is sflch 
not because it cannot be divided but because it cannot 
be divided into parts similar to the whole as to the 
division of the form into its component laws this is an 
abstract proceeding foreign to natural history i there 
fore there is so far nothing to prevent a crystal from being 
an individual 

 we cannot m necker goes on to remark con 
sider the integrant molecules as individuals these are 
useful abstractions but abstractions only which w must 
not deal with as real objects haiiy himself warns us 
that his doctrine of increments is a purely abstract con 
ception and that nature in fact follows a different 
process accordingly weiss and mohs express laws 
identical with those of haiiy without even speaking of 
molecules and wollaston and davy have deemed it 
probable that the molecules are not polyhedrons but 
spheres or spheroids such mere creations of the mind 
can never be treated as individuals if the maxim of 

 rtyne mineral p t ib p ib y p 

a p 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

natural history that the species is a collection of indi 
viduals be applied so as to make those individuals mere 
abstractions or if instead of individuals we take such 
an abstraction as substance or matter the course of natu 
ral history is altogether violated and yet this error has 
hitherto generally prevailed and mineralogists have clas 
sified not things but abstract ideas 

 but it may be saiclf will not the small solids obtained 
by cleavage better answer the idea of individuals to 
this it is replied that these small solids have no indepen 
dent existence they are only the result of a mode of 
division they are never found separate and indepen 
dent the secondary forms which they compose are 
determined by various circumstances the nature of the 
solution c and the cleavage which produces these 
small solids is only one result among many from the crys 
talline forces 

thus neither integrant molecules nor solids obtained 
by cleavage can be such mineral ogical individuals as the 
spirit of natural history requires hence it appears that 
we must take the real crystals for individuals 

 we must however reject crystals generally 
large ones which are obviously formed of several smaller 
ones of a similar form as occurs so often in quartz and 
calc spar we must also distinguish cases in which a 
large regular form is composed of smaller but different 
regular forms as octahedrons of fluor spar made up of 
cubes here the small component forms are the indi 
viduals also we must notice the cases in which we 
have a natural crystal similar to the primary form here 
the face will show whether the body is a result obtained 
by cleavage or a natural individual 

 it will be objected that the crystalline form ought 

 regne mineral p t ib p j ib p

application to mineralogy 

not to be made the dominant character in mineralogy 
since it rarely occurs perfect to this it is replied that 
even if the application of the principle be difficult still it 
has been shown to be the only true principle and there 
fore we have no alternative but further it is not true 
that amorphous substances are more numerous than crys 
tals in leonhards manual of oryctoynosy there are 
 mineral substances of these have a crystalline 
structure and only have not been found in a regular 
form 

again the crystalline forms have each its varie 
ties some of which are crystalline and some are not so 
now the crystalline varieties amount to and the 
uncrystalline to only thus mineralogy according 
to the view of it here presented has a sufficiently wide 
fieldf 

 it will be objected that according to this mode 
of proceeding we must reject from our system all non 
crystalline minerals but we reply that if the mass be 
composed of crystals the size of the crystals makes no 
difference now lamellar and other compact masses are 
very generally groups of crystals in various positions 
individuals mutilated and mixed together are not the less 
individuals and therefore such masses may be treated as 
objects of natural history 

if we cannot refer all rocks to crystalline species 
those which elude our method may appear as an appen 
dix corresponding to those which botanists call genera 
incertce sedis 

but these genera and species will often be afterwards 
removed into the crystalline part of the system by being 
identified with crystalline species thus pyrope c 
have been referred to garnet and basalt wacke c to 

 regne mineral p t p j ib t p 
 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

compound rocks thus veins of dolerite visibly com 
posed of two or three elements pass to an apparently 
simple state by becoming finegrained 

 finally f we have to ask are artificial crystals to 
enter into our classification m necker answers no 
because they are the result of art like mules mestizos 
hybrids and the like 

 upon these opinions we may observe that they 
appear to be in the main consistent with the soundest 
philosophy that each natural crystal is an individual 
is a doctrine which is the only basis of mineralogy as a 
natural historical science yet the imperfections and 
confused unions of crystals make this principle difficult 
to apply perhaps it may be expressed in a more precise 
manner by referring to the crystalline forces and to the 
axes by which their operation is determined rather than 
to the external form that portion of a mineral sub 
stance is a mineralogical individual which is determined 
by crystalline forces acting to the same axes in this 
way we avoid the difficulty arising from the absence of 
faces and enable ourselves to use either cleavage or optical 
properties or any others as indications of the identity of 
the individual the individual extends so far as the polar 
forces extend by which crystalline form is determined 
whether or not those forces produce their full effect a 
perfectly circumscribed polyhedron 

 there is only one material point on which our 
principles lead us to differ from m necker the pro 
priety of including artificial crystals in our mineralogical 
classification to exclude them as he does is a conclu 
sion so entirely at variance with the whole course of his 
own reasonings that it is difficult to conceive that he would 
persist in his conclusion if his attention were drawn to 
the question more steadily for as he justly sayst each 

 regne mineral p t p j ib t p 



application to mineralogy 

science has its appropriate domain determined by its 
peculiar point of view now artificial and natural crys 
tals are considered in the same point of view namely 
with reference to crystalline physical and optical pro 
perties as subservient to classification and ought there 
fore to belong to the same science again he says 
that chemistry would reject as useless all notice of the 
physical properties and external characters of substances if 
a special science were to take charge of the description and 
classification of these products but such a special science 
must be mineralogy for we cannot well make one science 
of classification of natural and another of artificial sub 
stances or if we do the two sciences will be identical 
in method and principles and will extend over each 
others boundaries so that it will be neither useful nor 
possible to distinguish them again m neckers own 
reasonings on the selection of the individual in minera 
logy are supported by well chosen exarnplesf but these 
examples are taken from artificial salts as for instance 
common salt crystallizing in different mixtures again 
the analogy of mules and mestizos as products of art 
with chemical compounds is not just chemical com 
pounds correspond rather to natural species propagated 
by man under the most natural circumstances in order 
that he may study the laws of their production 

 but the decisive argument against the separation 
of natural and artificial crystals in our schemes of classi 
fication is that we cannot make such a separation sub 
stances which were long known only as the products of 
the laboratory are often discovered after a time in 
natural deposits are the crystals which are found in a 
forgotten retort or solution to be considered as belonging

j we may remark that m necker in his own arrangement of 
minerals inserts among his species iron and lead which do not occur

 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

to a different science from those which occur in a deserted 
mine and are the crystals which are produced where 
man has turned a stream of water or air out of its course 
to be separated from natural crystals when the composi 
tion growth and properties are exactly the same in 
both and again how many natural crystals can we 
already produce by synthesis how many more may we 
hope to imitate hereafter m necker himself states 
that mitscherlich found in the scoriae of the mines of 
sweden and germany artificial minerals having the same 
composition and the same crystalline form with natural 
minerals as silicates of iron lime and magnesia agree 
ing with peridot bisilicate of iron lime and magnesia 
agreeing with pyroxene red oxide of copper oxide of 
zinc protoxide of iron fer bxydule sulphurets of iron 
zinc lead arseniuret of nickel black mica these 
were accidental results of fusion but m berthier by 
bringing together the elements in proper quantities has 
succeeded in composing similar minerals and has thus 
obtained artificial silicates with the same forms and the 
same characters as natural silicates other chemists 
m haldat m becquerel have in like manner obtained 
by artificial processes other crystals known previously 
as occurring naturally how are these crystals thus 
identical with natural minerals to be removed out of the 
domain of mineralogy and transferred to a science which 
shall classify artificial crystals only if this be done the 
mineralogist will not be able to classify any specimen till 
he has human testimony whether it was found naturally 
occurring or produced by chemical art or is the other 
alternative to be taken and are these crystals to be given 
up to mineralogy because they occur naturally also 
but what can be more unphilosophical than to refer to 
separate sciences the results of chemical processes closely

allied and all but identical the chemist constructs 
bisilicates and these are classified by the mineralogist 
but if he constructs a trisilicate it belongs to anotlier 
science all these intolerable incongruities are avoided 
by acknowledging that artificial as well as natural 
crystals belong to the domain of mineralogy it is in 
fact the name only of mineralogy which appears to dis 
cover any inconsistency in this mode of proceeding 
mineralogy is the representative of a science which has 
a wider office than mineralogists first contemplated but 
which must exist in order that the body of science may 
be complete there must as we have already said be a 
science the object of which is to classify bodies by their 
physical characters in order that we may have some 
means of asserting chemical truths concerning bodies 
some language in which we may express the propositions 
which chemical analysis discovers and this science will 
have its object prescribed not by any accidental or arbitrary 
difference of the story belonging to each specimen not 
by knowing whether the specimen was found in the 
mine or in the laboratory produced by attempting to 
imitate nature or to do violence to her but will have 
its course determined by its own character the range 
and boundaries of this science will be regulated by the 
ideas with which it deals like all other sciences it 
must extend to everything to which its principles apply 
the limits of the province which it includes are fixed 
by the consideration that it must be a connected whole 
no previous definition no historical accident no casual 
phrase can at all stand in the way of philosophical coii 
sistency can make this science exclude what that 
includes or oblige it to admit what that rejects and thus 
whatever we call our science whether we term it 
external chemistry mineralogy the natural history of 
inorganic bodies since it can be nothing but the 



philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

science of the classification of inorganic bodies of definite 
forms and properties it must classify all such bodies 
whether or not they be minerals and whether or not they 
be natural 

 in the application of the principles of classifica 
tion to minerals the question occurs what are to be 
considered as mineral species by species we are to 
understand according to the usage of other parts of 
natural history the lowest step of our subordinate divi 
sions the most limited of the groups which have defi 
nite distinctions what definite distinctions of groups 
of objects of any kind really occur in nature is to be 
learnt from an examination of nature and the result of 
our inquiries will be some general principle which con 
nects the members of each group and distinguishes the 
members of groups which though contiguous are dif 
ferent in the classification of organized bodies the rule 
which thus presides over the formation of species is the 
principle of reproduction those animals and those 
plants are of the same species which are produced from 
a common stock or which resemble each other as much 
as the progeny of a common stock accordingly in 
practice if any questions arise whether two varieties of 
form be of the same or different species it is settled by 
reference to the fact of reproduction and when it is 
ascertained that the two forms come within the habitual 
and regalar limits of a common circle of reproduction 
they are held to be of the same species now in crystals 
this principle of reproduction disappears altogether and 
the basis of the formation of species must be sought 
elsewhere we must have some other principle to 
replace the reproduction which belongs only to organic 
life this principle will be we may expect one which 
secures the permanence and regularity of mineral forms 
as tke reproductive power does of animal and vegetable 



application to mineralogy 

such a principle is the power of crystallization the 
forces of which solidity cohesion and crystallization are 
the result are those which give to minerals their perma 
nent existence and their physical properties and ever 
since the discovery of the distinctions of crystalline forms 
and crystalline systems it is certain that this force dis 
tinguishes groups of crystals in the most precise and 
definite manner the rhombohedral carbonates of lime 
and of iron for instance are distinguished exactly by the 
angles of their rhombohedrons and if in the case of 
any proposed crystal we should doubt to which kind the 
specimen belongs the measurement of the angles of 
cleavage would at once decide the question the prin 
ciple of crystallization therefore appears from analogy 
to be exactly fitted to take the place of the principle of 
animal generation the forces which make the indivi 
dual permanent and its properties definite here stand in 
the place of the forces which preserve the race while 
individuals are generated and die 

 according to this view the different modifica 
tions of the same crystalline form would be varieties only 
of the same species all the various solids for example 
which are produced by the different laws of derivation of 
rhombohedral carbonate of lime would fall within the 
same species and this appears to be required by the 
general analogy of natural history for these differences 
of form produced by the laws of crystalline deriva 
tion are not definite the faces which are added to 
one form in order to produce another may be of any 
size small or large and thus the crystal which represents 
one modification passes by insensible degrees to another 
the forms of calc spar which we call dogtooth spar 
cannon spar nailhead spar and the like appear at first 
no doubt distinct enough but so do the races of dogs 
and we find in the mineral as in the animal that the 
vol i l 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

distinction is obliterated by taking such intermediate 
steps as really occur and if a fragment of any of these 
crystals is given us we can determine that it is rhombo 
hedral carbonate of lime but it is not possible in 
genera to determine to which of the kinds of crystal it 
has belonged 

 notwithstanding these considerations m necker 
has taken for his basis of mineral species the secondary 
modifications and not the primary forms thus cubical 
galena octahedral galena and triform galena are with him 
three species of crystals 

on this i have to observe as i have already done 
that on this principle we have no definite distinction of 
species for these forms may and do pass into each 
other among cubooctahedrons of galena occur cubes 
and octahedrons as one face or another vanishes and 
the transition is insensible we shall on this principle 
find almost always three or four species in the same tuft 
of crystals for almost every individual in such assem 
blages may exhibit a different combination of secondary 
faces again in cases where the secondary laws are 
numerous it would be impracticable to enumerate all 
their combinations and impossible therefore to give a 
list of species accordingly m neckerf gives seventy 
one species of spath calcaire and then says nous 
navons pas enumere la dixieme partie des especes con 
nues de ce genre qui se m on tent a plus de huit cents 
again in many substances of which few crystals are 
found every new specimen would be a new species if 
indeed it were perfect enough to be referred to a species 
at all but from a specimen without perfect external 
form however perfect in crystalline character although 
everything else might be known angles optical pro 

 regne mineral p t ib ii

perties physical properties and chemical constitution 
the species could not be determined thus necker says 
of the micas quant aux especes propre a chaque genre 
la lac une sera presque complete car jusqu ici les cris 
taux entiers de mica et cle talc nont pas ete fort com 
muns 

these inconveniencies arise from neglecting the lead 
ing rule of natural history that the predominant prin 
ciple of the existence of an object must determine the 
species whether this principle be reproduction operating 
for development or crystallization operating for perma 
nence of form we may add to the above statement of 
inconveniencies this that if m neckers view of mine 
ralogical species be adopted the distinction of species is 
vague and indefinite while that of genera is perfectly pre 
cise and rigorous an aspect of the system entirely at 
variance with other parts of natural history for in all 
these the species is a more definite group than the genus 

this result follows as has already been said from 
m neckers wish to have individuals marked by ex 
ternal form if instead of this we are contented to 
take for an individual that portion of a mass of whatever 
form which is connected by the continuous influence of 
the same crystalline forces by whatever incidents these 
forces may be manifested as cleavage physical and opti 
cal properties our mode of proceeding avoids all the 
above inconveniencies applies alike to the most perfect 
and most imperfect specimens and gives a result agree 
able to the general analogy of natural history and the 
rules of its methods f

i now quit the subject of mere resemblance and pro 
ceed to treat of that natural affinity which natural 
systems of classification for organic bodies must involve 



chapter tv 
of the idea of natural affinity 

 in the second chapter of this book it was 
shown that although the classificatory sciences proceed 
ostensibly upon the idea of resemblance as their main 
foundation they necessarily take for granted in the 
course of their progress a further idea of natural affinity 
this appeared by a general consideration of the nature 
of science by the recognition of natural species and 
genera even in artificial systems of classification and 
by the attempts of botanists to form a natural system 
it further appeared that among the processes by which 
endeavours have been made to frame a natural system 
some as the method of blind trial and the method or 
general comparison have been altogether unsuccessful 
being founded only upon a collection of resemblances 
casual in the one case and arbitrary in the other in 
neither of these processes is there employed any general 
principle by which we may be definitely directed as to 
what resemblances we should employ or by which the 
result at which we arrive may be verified and confirmed 
our object in the present chapter is to show that the 
idea of natural affinity supplies us with a principle 
which may answer such purposes

idea of natural affinity 

i shall first consider the idea of affinity as exempli 
fied in organized beings in doing this we may appear 
to take for granted ideas which have not yet come under 
our discussion as the ideas of organization and vital 
function but it will be found that the principle to which 
we are led is independent of these additional ideas 

 we have already seen that the attempts to dis 
cover the divisions which result from this natural affinity 
have led to the consideration of the subordination of 
characters it is easy to see that some organs are more 
essential than others to the existence of an organized 
being the organs of nutrition for example more essen 
tial than those of locomotion but at the same time it 
is clear that any arbitrary assumption of a certain scale 
of relative values of different kinds of characters will lead 
only to an artificial system this will happen if for 
example we begin by declaring the nutritive to be supe 
rior in importance to the reproductive functions it is 
clear that this relation of importance of organs and 
functions must be collected by the study of the organized 
beings and cannot be determined a priori without de 
priving us of all right to expect a general accordance 
between our system and the arrangement of nature we 
see therefore that our notion of natural affinity involves 
in it this consequence that it is not to be made out by 
an arbitrary subordination of characters 

 the functions and actions of living things which 
we separate from each other in our consideration cannot 
be severed in nature each function is essential life 
implies a collection of movements and ceases when any 
of these movements is stopped a change in the organi 
zation subservient to one set of functions may lead neces 
sarily to a change in the organization belonging to others 
we can often see this necessary connexion and from a 
comparison of the forms of organized beings from the 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

way in which their structure changes in passing from one 
class to another we are led to the conviction that there 
is some general principle which connects and graduates 
all such changes when the circulatory system changes 
the nervous system changes also when the mode of 
locomotion changes the respiration is also modified 

 these corresponding changes may be considered as 
ways in which the living thing is fitted to its mode of 
life as marks of adaptation to a purpose oi as it has 
been otherwise expressed as results of the conditions of 
existence but at the present moment we put forward 
these correspondencies in a different light we adduce 
them as illustrations of what we mean by affinity and 
what we consider as the tendency of a natural classifi 
cation it has sometimes been asserted that if we were 
to classify any of the departments of organized nature by 
means of one function and then by means of another the 
two classifications if each strictly consistent with itself 
would be consistent with each other such an assertion 
is perhaps more than we are entitled to make with con 
fideftce but it shows very well what is meant by affinity 
the disposition to believe such a general identity of all 
partial natural classifications shows how readily we fix 
upon the notion of affinity as general result of the 
causes which determine the forms of living things 
when these causes or principles of whatever nature they 
are conceived to be vary so as to modify one part of the 
organization of the being they also modify another and 
thus the groups which exhibit this variation of the funda 
mental principles of form are the same whether the 
manifestation of the change be sought in one part or in 
another of the organized structure the groups thus 
formed are related by affinity and in proportion as we 
find the evidence of more functions and more organs to 
the propriety of our groups we are more and more satis 



idea of natual affinity 

fied that they are natural classes it appears then 
that our idea of affinity involves the conviction of the 
coincidence of natural arrangements formed on different 
functions and this rather than the principle of the sub 
ordination of some characters to others is the true 
ground of the natural method of classification 

 for example cuvier after speaking of the subor 
dination of characters as the guide which he intends to 
follow in his arrangement of animals interprets this 
principle in such a manner as to make it agree nearly 
with the one just stated in pursuance of what has 
been said on methods in general w r e now require to 
know what characters in animals are the most influential 
and therefore those which must be made the grounds of 
the primary divisions these he says it is clear 
must be those which are taken from the animal func 
tions sensation and motion but how does he con 
firm this not by showing that the animal functions 
are independent of or predominant over the vegetative 
but by observing that they follow the same gradations 
 observation he continues confirms this view by 
showing that the degrees of developement and compli 
cation of the animal functions agree with those of the 
vegetative the heart and the organs of the circulation 
are a sort of centre for the vegetative functions as the 
brain and the trunk of the nervous system are for the 
animal functions now we see these two systems de 
scend in the scale and disappear the one with the other 
in the lowest animals when there are no longer any 
distinct nerves there are also no longer distinct fibres 
and the organs of digestion are simply hollowed out in 
the homogeneous mass of the body the muscular system 
disappears even before the nervous in insects but in 
general the distribution of the medullary masses corre 

 regne animal p 



 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

spends to that of the muscular instruments a spinal cord 
on which knots or ganglions represent so many brains 
corresponds to a body divided into numerous rings and 
supported on pairs of members placed at different points 
of the length and so on 

 this correspondence of the general forms which result 
from the arrangement of the motive organs from the dis 
tribution of the nervous masses and from the energy of 
the circulatory system must therefore form the ground 
of the first great sections by which we divide the animal 
kingdom 

 decandolle takes the same view there must be 
he says an equilibrium of the different functions and 
he exemplifies this by the case of the distinction of mono 
cotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants which being at 
first established by means of the organs of reproduction 
was afterwards found to coincide with the distinction of 
endogenous and exogenous which depends on the process 
of nutrition thus he adds the natural classes founded 
on one of the great functions of the vegetable are necessarily 
the same as those which are founded upon the other func 
tion and i find here a very useful criterion to ascertain 
whether a class is natural namely in order to announce 
that it is so it must be arrived at by the two roads 
which vegetable organization presents thus i affirm 
he says that the division of monocotyledons from 
dicotyledons and the distinction of grammes from 
cyperacese are real because in these cases i arrive at 
the same result by the reproductive and the nutritive 
organs while the distinction of monopetalous and poly 
petalous of rhodoracese and ericinese appears to me 
artificial because i can arrive at it only by the reproduc 
tive organs 

thus the correspondence of the indications of different 
 tl el p 



idea of natural affinity 

functions is the criterion of natural classes and this 
correspondence may be considered as one of the best and 
most characteristic marks of the fundamental idea of 
affinity and the maxim by which all systems professing 
to be natural must be tested is this that the arrange 
ment obtained from one set of characters coincides with the 
arrangement obtained from another set 

this idea of affinity as a natural connexion among 
various species of which connexion all particular resem 
blances are indications has principally influenced the 
attempts at classifying the animal kingdom the reason 
why the classification in this branch of natural history 
has been more easy and certain than that of the vegetable 
world is as decandolle says that besides the func 
tions of nutrition and reproduction which animals have 
in common with plants they have also in addition the 
function of sensation and thus have a new means of 
verification and concordance but we may add as a 
further reason that the functions of animals are necessa 
rily much more obvious and intelligible to us than those 
of vegetables from their clear resemblance to the opera 
tions which take place in our own bodies to which our 
attention has necessarily been strongly directed 

 the question here offers itself whether this idea 
of natural affinity is applicable to inorganic as well as 
to organic bodies whether there be natural affinities 
among minerals and to this we are now enabled to 
reply by considering whether or not the principle just 
stated is applicable in such cases and the conclusion 
to which our principle leads us is that there are such 
natural affinities among minerals since there are dif 
ferent sets of characters which may be taken and have 
by different writers been taken as the basis of classifica 
tion the hardness specific gravity colour lustre

 philosophy of the classificatory sciences 

crystallization and other external characters as they are 
termed form one body of properties according to which 
minerals may be classified as has in fact been done by 
molis breithaupt and others the chemical constitution 
of the substances on the other hand may be made the 
principle of their arrangement as was done by haiiy 
and more recently and on a different scheme by ber 
zelius which of these is the true and natural classifica 
tion to this we answer that each of these arrange 
ments is true and natural then and then only when it 
coincides with the other an arrangement by external 
characters which gives us classes possessing a common 
chemical character a chemical order which brings 
together like and separates unlike minerals such classi 
fications have the evidence of truth in their agreement 
with one another every classification of minerals which 
does not aim at and tend to such a result is so far merely 
arbitrary and cannot be subservient to the expression 
of general chemical and mineralogical truths which is the 
proper purpose of such a classification 

 in the history of mineralogy i have related the 
advances which have been made among mineralogists and 
chemists in modern times towards a system possessing 
this character of truth i have there described the mixed 
systems of werner and haiiy the attempt made by 
mohs to form a pure natural history system the first 
and second attempt of berzelius to form a pure chemical 
system and the failure of both these attempts but the 
distinct separation of the two elements of which science 
requires the coincidence threw a very useful light upon 
the subject and the succeeding mixed systems such as 
that of naumann approached much nearer to the true 
conditions of the problem than any of the preceding ones 
had done thus as i have stated several of naumanns 
groups have both a common chemical character and great 



idea of natural affinity 

external resemblances such are a anhydrous unmetallic 
haloids his anhydrous metallic haloids hydrous metal 
lic haloids oxides of metals pyrites glances blendes 
the existence of such groups shows that we may hope 
ultimately to obtain a classification of minerals which 
shall be both chemically significant and agreeable to the 
methods of natural history although when we consider 
how very imperfect as yet our knowledge of the chemical 
composition of minerals is we can hardly flatter ourselves 
that we shall arrive at such a result very soon 

we have thus seen that in mineralogy as well as in 
the sciences which treat of organized bodies we may 
apply the idea of natural affinity of which the funda 
mental maxim is that arrangements obtained from different 
sets of characters must coincide 

since the notion of affinity is thus applicable to 
inorganic as well as to organic bodies it is plain that it 
is not a mere modification of the idea of organization or 
function although it may in some of its aspects appear to 
approach near to these other ideas but these ideas or 
others which are the foundation of them necessarily enter 
in a very prominent and fundamental manner into all the 
other parts of natural history to the consideration of 
these therefore we shall now proceed

while there is a total absence of pretension in the general form and style of the volume 
it is evident that a great deal of reading and research have been requisite for its production 
and that the authoress must have turned over a number of dry and ponderous tomes the 
very sight of which would scare numbers of the fair sex thus though the 
book is short it is not superficial and moreover the authoress anxious to throw light on 
her subject from every side has not merely confined herself to geological sources but has 
brought in much collateral information chemical historical and etymological with 
etymology she has been particularly careful never introducing an unusual technical expres 
sion without giving its greek or latin origin while the work is excellently 
put together as a whole a very copious index renders easy a reference to any part a 
glossary is also added which explains all the technical words and thus the book contains all 
that those would desire to know whose occupations or inclinations hinder them from pursuing 
geology to any great extent and are at the same time desirous of knowing what their geolo
