general introduction 



 to protect and cherish learning has been 
the gracious office of the ministers of religion from 
the earliest times — and happily so — for the pro 
geny of mind like the offspring of the body 
require fostering in infancy and decline there is 
nevertheless a period of adolescence for both in 
which the free exercise of the faculties becomes 
requisite to their growth and maturity 

 cloistered by the hierophants and forbid 
den all freedom the arts of egypt were torpid 
cumbrous and distorted but transported by or 
pheus danaus cecrops and cadmus into the free 
atmosphere of greece and animated by emulation 
and affection they acquired grace and beauty 
whence it was elegantly said that in athens the 
graces rocked the cradle of art — that love 
taught it to speak — and liberty led it onward to 
perfection such also was the rise and career of 
infant science which from being mystic and mon

 that therefore thej mature mind should 
first have established laws for its own government 
on the latter soil and logic have arisen as a science 
among a people who first asserted the freedom of 
intellect is no more wonderful than that the science 
thus theoretically established should have made its 
next great advance with philosophy practically in 
a land of liberty among a people equally renowned 
for arts and sterling intelligence but it afibrds a 
remarkable coincidence denoting that as liberty 
has been the inseparable condition of excellence in 
art and science so in the perfection of freedom we 
may look for jthe perfection of knowledge through 
logic which extirpates prejudice gives laws to 
thought and authority to law with just regulation 
to the will and actions of mankind 

 we may also deduce hence an important 
reciprocation between liberty and logic which 
renders them expedient to each other for as reason 
coerced becomes folly so liberty without reason is 
mad — nor is there a subject whereof a correct 
understanding and comprehension of its true rela 
tions is more incumbent or in which illogical and 
absolute views have led to more deplorable conse 
quences than in this of liberty throughout the world

liberty and logic 

 personal liberty when politically uncon 
trolled tends only to confusion and crime intellec 
tual liberty the natural right of every mind tends 
also to moral philosophical and religious scepticism 
the liberty of speech the pen and the press 
so essential to hoth the former too often abuses 
freedom by libel and license or degenerates through 
mercenary advocacy dishonest assumption envious 
carping party spirit and contentious controversy 
into literary anarchy or intellectual tyranny 

 necessary therefore as liberty of thought 
speech and actions are to the wellbeing of man 
their due regulation is no less essential to their own 
interests and security but the full attainment and 
permanent security of external and internal freedom 
— or the liberty of body and mind — can be no 
otherwise assured than by establishing correctly 
their coessential analogy logically 

 personal freedom may be governed by exter 
nal or political law and intellectual freedom or 
liberty of conscience may be ruled by internal or 
moral law but that by which they are coessentially 
connected — the freedom of thought expression 
and the press — without which neither of the others 
can long subsist yields to neither of these laws and 
can alone be adequately governed or controlled by 
logical law — or the law and authority of reason 
and truth — against which ignorance and selfishness 
are perpetually at war and hence there is nothing 
more essential to the highest good and peace of

mankind than a correct logic — the criterion of 
truth and right 

 should therefore a new and true sera of uni 
versal liberty dawn upon the world a corresponding 
developement of logic must arise to save and sustain 
it from that autonomy at which republicanism aims 
for in the authority of perfect logic opinion and 
action will yield to reason and demagogic and 
presumptuous authority sink alike to their proper 
levels and names go for neither more nor less than 
they express as in logistics or the science of 
numbers to the ratios of which all minds submit 
without appeal 

 milton the glorious champion of virtuous 
freedom in all its forms must have been prescient 
of this and his treatise on education and his 
artis logicsb plenior institutio were probably 
the results of such conviction but as he added 
nothing to the science then in disfavour having 
adopted the doctrine of ramus — another champion 
of freedom and victim to intellectual tyranny — he 
left logic the fundamental and sole just controlling 
power of the free mind as he found it and commit 
ted liberty to the coercion of policy 

 happily the great predisposer has ordained 
universally that every power whether physical sen 
sual or moral shall evolve its opposite whence 

 we do not hesitate to reclaim this term to its genuine 
signification from the gross and corrupt sense in which it is 
vulgarly used

liberty and logic 

the negative arises with the positive every love and 
indination gives out its opposite aversion every 
virtue points its vice every position supposes its 
contrary and the discovery of the one discloses the 
other just as action and reaction are equal and 
opposed harmony results from contrast tyranny 
educes liberty and liberty elicits law while free 
intellection calls forth logic for its control as it 
did in greece 

 it is hence apparent that conformably to 
nature and reason philosophy arising from the 
freedom and communication of thought is correla 
tive with logic and that they can only succeed in 
concurrence or err apart for rational liberty is 
in every way coincident with intellect 

 it is because liberty has not hitherto enacted 
a perfect logic that logic has failed to license a 
refined and moral liberty — for these are reciprocal 
and if liberty has been better attained longer 
preserved and more widely extended by the british 
people than by others it has been because they 
have excelled in logical intelligence no less than 
in practical diligence affording a ray of hope for 
degraded humanity that in the full accomplish 
ment of these faculties liberty virtue and hap 
piness will be established and perpetuated through 
out the world it is by the latent influence 
of reason that men submit to any other govern 
ment than those of brute violence and force and

perfect logic and by reason to make absolute the 
authority of law 

 as in morals and politics so has god given 
reason to man in religion as a light and guide 
throughout ethics — the sole ground of true convic 
tion and pure faith in things intellectual and 
spiritual the logician is therefore bound to regard 
the truths of correct reason as of greater certainty 
and authority than any human records nor can he 
receive such in contradiction to reason on any 
authority — nor can it be truly objected that this 
is opposed to any article of sacred scripture or 
christian faith as divinely revealed both being 
necessarily consonant to reason as inspired by god 
— the divine logos 

 truth whether of religion or of other 
things must be brought to the test of the highest 
faculty — to that reason from which there is no 
appeal or men will continue to fashion their faith 
to their inclinations and act in subversion of moral 
political and religious good but truth and reason 
which are one are the authority of god nor does 
it impugn his ordinances to assert their agreement 
with the logical faculty which is of the spirit of 
the logos whence all truth and good 

 nor must the unqualified state of human 
reason be urged against these positions but only to 
impress on logicians legislators and divines the 
expediency of perfecting logic and the propriety 
of preserving modesty and forbearance in our judg

have extirpated prejudice and established through 
reason the authority of truth 

 the infant and the ignorant believe or 
disbeliote any thing however absurd upon confidence 
or authority while the vicious shape their creeds to 
their selfishness for any one to say he believes 
what he does not understand is as much only as to 
say he believes it wilfully or does not understand 
it at all to believe truly is to understand and to 
understand is to have rational or sensible compre 
hension and to disbelieve is the same any belief 
beyond or short of either is weak vicious idle or in 
sane but as none are of the absolute extremes of 
infant weakness or of divine wisdom so must men be 
relatively determined in the mean according to 
reason or continue to be the subjects of prejudice 
ignorance or indiflference 

 the popular argument against reason in 
religious judgments hits fallacies but these which 
have been made so much of by logicians contradict 
reason and are dissipated by its lights to argue 
against reason is of all logical fallacies the greatest 
and urgently demands the reparation of reason and 
the reformation of logic 

 faith is the conviction of things thought 
but not seen and as there can be no true convic 
tion that is not logical so neither can there be any 
faith for our reliance that is not rational and such

 introduction 

as may banish hypocrisy from the ordinances of man 
and establish the ordinances of the god of truth 
throughout ethics 

 logical instruction is therefore chiefly in 
cumbent — education of the faculties and above 
all of the highest faculty of mind and morals is 
the first duty of man for to reason belongs the 
control of reasonable beings and any intolerance 
of reason or harmless opinion by custom or autho 
rity is incitement to deceit sedition or infidelity and 
a debasement of humanity altogether if therefore 
the word liberal mean jree without logic which 
teaches the use of the selfgoverning faculty of rea 
son the term a liberal education is a solecism 

 even more forcibly is this natural alliance 
of liberty and logic impressed upon the mind and 
confirmed by christianity the divine vindication of 
moral and religious liberty — the only logical reli 
gion — in its purity binding man by no other laws 
than those of reason and truth which are the laws 
of god — a religion which precedes all human 
progress as a pillar of light at once rational and 
free 

 and on no subject has human reason been 
more eminently exerted than on christianity which 
has risen in purity with sound logic and sunk with 
it in all the corruptions of learning and the schools 
— happily emancipated from which and from all 
irrational restraints logic and liberty may proceed

hand in hand and in the perfection of logic we 
repeat we may confidently look for the accomplish 
ment of religion morality and law 

 logically to follow truth wherever it 
leads is the first principle of improvement in every 
science and will without doubt when freely pur 
sued conduct men to ail truth and in the end to 
all oood for the identity of their relations is ad 
mitted and as truth is for good and not good 

for truth truth precedes good theoretically but 
good stands first practically and as there is no 
thing perfect but in degree and all human doctrines 
and institutions are mixtures of truth and error — 
good and evil — it is highly reprehensible and 
irrational to pull down any fabric of good under 
pretence of truth until we are prepared with cer 
tainty to set up a better in its place and this 
applies to every doctrine and establishment whether 
religious political moral or material 

 since therefore truth is the great instru 
ment of improvement and reform and logic is the 
science of truth let us inquire into the rise and 
progress of logic that seeing what has been done 
we may learn what is yet required for a discipline 
so important to the good and advancement of man

 introduction 



rise and progress of logic 

 dialectical philosophy or logical argument 
the subject of which is as old as the human mind 
was first attributed as science to parmenides and 
zeno the eleatic his disciple who was of eastern 
origin and both of these philosophers were pythago 
reans after whom logic was improved by euclid 
of megara a disciple of socrates and contemporary 
of plato who also employed the socratic induction 
but these early logicians seem to have accom 
plished little more for logic than to have collected 
and handed down the philosophic universals which 
were afterwards arranged by aristotle the scholar 
of plato and by him established as the categories 
or universal predicaments and fundamentals of the 
syllogistic organ 

 plato and his master socrates when com 
bating the sophists or scholastics of greece who 
first elicited logic by their quibbles and subtleties 
employed analogical dialogy and induction to 
which aristotle added and carried out if not in 
vented the syllogistic organ and systematised 
philosophy in correspondence with logic thus 
completely displaying the forces of logical science 
and marshalling them with a skill and acumen that 
defeated the reigning sophism and justly entitled 
him to be regarded as the parent and prince of

rise and progress of logic 

logicians although he thereby transfered philo 
sophy to intellectual ground and rendered it uni 
versally subjective from which time to that of 
bacon the study of objective nature languished in 
proportion as artificial logic prevailed 

 the testimony of history concerning these 
early circumstances of the science is extant in the 
writings of plato and aristotle the latter of whom 
adverts to the rise of logic at the end of his or 
ganonand they are conveyed traditionally in various 
compilations since there is yet also a modern 
conjectural opinion of its origin from the east in 
countries to which the greek philosophers travelled 
wherein have been discovered records of the logical 
disciplines coincident with those of the greeks — 
but whether of indian persian egyptian or chal 
dean origin may still be questioned 

 from the time of aristotle logic ran the 
course of the grecian schools without material 
change in its structure subjecting every inquiry 
and science to its influence and perverting the anti 
sophistical intention of its founders till the time of 
epicurus who opposed the lofty dialectic of the 
stoics with whom also the career of the greek sects 
of philosophy terminated and who utterly corrupted 
and subverted their logic by his kavftv — canons 
or critic of judgment — under which title he is 
said to have composed a book wherein he consigned

all judgment of reason to sense and held the 
senses to be the messengers and judges of truth — 
a doctrine still rife among modem empiricists and 
consistently with which he held rhetoric and also 
the mathematics in contempt it being quite natu 
ral that the philosophy of sense should depreciate 
the logic of reason which our enlightened age has 
seen also exploded under no better pretence than 
that offences have been perpetrated in its name 

 subsequently to epicurus and among the 
romans nothing important appears to have been 
accomplished in logic except indeed that it is 
recorded by quinctilian and others that c julius 
csbsar composed a treatise on the logic of ana 
logy — and a manuscript bearing the same title has 
been disinterred at herculaneum but it has not we 
believe been unfolded nor the name of its author 
ascertained from the title of csbsars work de 
analogia the object of which being it is said to 
determine the vse of words to congruity according 
to reason it was probably philological rather than 
logical and bacon calls it a certain grammatical 
philosophy but the work being lost conjecture is 
vain and we notice it only from the importance of 
the subject and its titular coincidence with the 
present essay

darkness from the closing of the athenian schools 
to the reformation of luther about which time

so yet not suddenly — for some of the most 
eminent reasoners of the time and milton among 
them followed the logic of ramus but the first 
fruits of freedom from aristotles authority in 
rhetoric and poetic which are parts of his logic 
were matured by the genius of shakspearet 

 notwithstanding bacons reform of philo 
sophy at length supplanted the logic of his prede 
cessors he left his own in a very incomplete state 
and although it has been widely extended in matter 
and practice it has not undergone any remarkable 
improvement in form or theory

practical extreme has done more for the advance 
ment of physical science than all other disciplines 
together as its author intended and has indeed 
been the mightiest advent hitherto for the ameliora 
tion civilisation and mental reformation of society 
— the christian dispensation only excepted 

s a slight glance at the modern history of 
science may satisfy us of these facts one of the 
earliest and most illustrious disciples of the reformed 
school of logic and philosophy if not also a prin 
cipal therein was the friend and physician of bacon 
the immortal harvey the first great supporter of 
experimental induction the fruits of whose exer 
citations were the doctrines of circulation secretion 
and generation whereby he threw a light into 
animal and vegetal physiology that has disclosed 
new systems and discoveries that have given lustre 
to many great names in medical and botanical 
science 

 to the harveian circulation and economy 
of the human microcosm succeeded the newtonian 
circulation and economy of the celestial macro 
cosm founded alike on the ground of experimental 
induction and both established as general doctrines 
on true physical principles for ever 

 since this was written it has been announced 
at oxford that the only difficulty in the doctrine

by the vast power of the improved microscope at 
the same time also that the newtonian circulation 
of the physical universe has been coinddently illus 
trated by the astonishing powers of the rossian 
telescope 

 were this the proper place we might dilate 
on the extension of harveys doctrine by john 
brown lineus and other eminent followers and 
disciples of the inductive school who have filled 
with their lights and discoveries the wide range of 
physics between the extreme systems of those two 
great men harvey and newton to the immense 
advancement of the knowledge civilisation and 
wellbeing of mankind 

 more germane to our inquiry is the despic 
able logic prevalent in harveys time concerning 
which we have his own testimony the method 
of investigating truth commonly pursued at this 
time said he is to be held as erroneous and 
almost foolish in which so many inquire what 
others have said and omit to ask whether the 
things themselves be actually so or not and single 
universal conclusions being deduced from several pre 
mises and analogies being thence shaped out we 
have frequently mere verisimilitudes handed down to 
lis instead of positive truths whence we learn that

knowledge and sophists trimming up the discoveries 
of others changing the arrangement only or the 
language and adding a few things of no importance 
audaciously send them forth as their own c a 
sort of practice we apprehend still lingering among 
writers 

 harvey has also instructed us in the proper 
method of applying logic hy experimental induc

hibiting the method of investigation which i have 
followed i may propose to the studious a new and 
unless i mistake a safer way to the attainment of

of experimental induction to the ancients and 
especially to aristotle citing from the latter that 
although that reasoning is naturally prior and 
more known which proceeds by syllogism still is 
that more perspicuous to us which is based on in

 introduction 

locke whose celebrated essay on the human 
understanding maintained an influence hardly in 
ferior to that of bacon that has terminated the 
second ra of logic by appeal downward to com 
mon sense not only in physics but in every inquiry 
of the human mind 

 logic being thus referred and accommo 
dated to popular understanding and sense and 
philosophy converted into practical experience on 
the same ground it may be expedient to take a 
wider survey of the influence of the baconian revo 
lution and inquire into the means of restoring 
logic as an entire and universal discipline 



modern logic 

 when bacon released philosophy from the 
trammels of the schools he assigned to it a new 
method which established for the advancement of 
mankind a new and important sera in physics but 
which while it checked the career of idle dispute 
and the puerilities founded on the peripatetic dis 
cipline nearly extinguished its logic and al 
though philosophy was thus placed on a new and 
physically reformed foundation logic the criterion 
of all faith truth and knowledge remained as a 
whole in the obsolescence to which bacon and his 
successors consigned the syllogism and the at

tempts made to restore the science to its integrity 
have failed to disengage it from the confused mass 
of scholastic trivialities and useless suhtilties by 
which from the time of the sophists to the extinc 
tion of their emulators the scholastics it was distin 
guished 

 hence induction on which the new philo 
sophy is founded has ever since taken precedence 
of syllogism or supplied its place and late writers 
on logic have continued to aim at keeping down the 
syllogistic logic by the inductive without purifying 
the science from scholasticism while they follow 
a fashion and fly according to the too frequent 
practice of reformers from one vicious extreme to 
its opposite whence it has happened that the organ 
subserving sense and experiment in philosophy has 
overpeered the organs of higher intellect and that 
the physical sciences have risen above the moral 
thus logic whose oflice it is to regulate inquiry is 
itself in confusion while the rapid increase of know 
ledge is every day rendering such regulation more 
and more necessary 

 the failure of modern logicians to restore 
the science seems in a great measure attributable to 
their having adopted one or other of the hypotheses 
which involved the disputes of the schools and the 
having retained therewith the distinctions and divi 
sions by which they perplexed the understanding 
but from which it is the first duty of logicians to 
clear the ground of the science

 introduction 

 of these hypotheses which divided the 
schools the most celebrated were nominalism 
conceptualismy and realism — or verbalism ideal 
ism and materialism either as logically or philoso 
phically regarded which assumed words thoughts 
or things as their respective objects and have one 
or other infested logic and philosophy to this 
hour 

 the first steps towards the entire reesta 
blishment of logic appears therefore to be to clear 
the ground from these hypotheses and all useless 
distinctions — to reconstruct the science upon the 
full breadth of its foundation avoiding the propen 
sity of writers to circumscribe a subject to especial 
views encumbered with endless details and illustra 
tions and to treat it as a whole with all expedient 
simplicity 

 yet is it not necessary in such an attempt 
to disembrangle the disputes of past ages which 
sufibcate reason at its source and which if as is 
said they sharpen the wits of men it is only as these 
sharpen their weapons for disabling and destroying 
but it is necessary to extirpate the taste for logical 
tournament which prevailed in the schools to the 
obstruction of science and that advocacy debate 
and partyspirit by which logicians and philosophers 
like politicians and divines are led into contentions 
and that idolatry of names opinions and authorities 
which obstruct truth none of which can be main

recognises no mode of induction except that of 
trying hypothesis after hypothesis until one is found

is to be assumed as true with no other reservation 
than that if on examination it should appear to 
assume more than is needful for explaining the 
phenomena the superfluous part of the assumption 
should be cut ofi it is no exaggeration to say that 
the process which we have described in these few

the physical inquirer has two logical modes of 
equal authority in the investigations of mind the 
one hy which he analyses its faculties and functions 
the other hy which he sunthesises or builds them up

at every station he attained certain absolute forms

found too that his deductions and inductions of the 
understanding and sense or his categories and

successors — the separation of reason firom un 
derstanding and the assumption of logical 
categories into sense to the embarrassment of both 
physics and metaphysics justly nevertheless has 
this learned and profound thinker declared that the 
necessary condition of a critically correct philo 
sophy rests solely upon this that iu order to a 
complete system it must contain a full analysis of 
the whole of human cognition a priori but to 
this a complete logic wherein he failed is pre 
essential 

 the failure of the transcendental logic is 
even more apparent in physics wherein the experi 
mental method of induction is still the effective 
mode and if the old english distinctions of truth 
into subjective and objective be wellfounded in logic 
and philosophy then is the subjective treatment of 
objective sciences as illegitimate as it is illogical 
and fruitless in physics — falsely assuming the posi 
tion of deity and descending therefrom it becomes 
obscure and mystic while in the objective view 
ascent from the world to deity is suited to the 
human faculties progressive and perspicuous 

 since then on the one hand logic and 
philosophy have been subtilized into mere visions 
of intellect and on the other sunk into the gross 
realities of sense equally at variance with universal 
reason a mode that reconciles these extremes to

 introduction 

reason is essential to the reformation of logic and 
correct science 

 the time has however yet to arrive for the 
consummation of logic as a whole syllogism 
which sprung on mathematical ground and is a logic 
of mere ratios has exercised its best powers on the 
mathematical disciplines — induction or oenera 
logisniy which arose similarly on a physical founda 
tion is still realising its powers in the physical 
sciences and misapplying them in the rational — 
and to the analogism there yet remains the meta 
physical ground whereon to exercise its universal 
powers logically and in the demonstration of moral 
ends we call on logicians therefore to cultivate 
this neglected mode 

 but here it is especially to be remarked 
that we do not employ the term analogism in the 
rhetorical and popular signification of resemblance or 
similitude but as strictly and abstractly denoting a 
real and reciprocal relation which being paradigm 
atical pervades and connects the universe logi 
callty and is the foundation of all parity of reason 
all proportionalities resemblances and similitudes 
to determine its regulation and laws is therefore of 
the utmost importance to developement through 
out philosophy and indispensable to correct under 
standing and logic

developed as in the progress of knowledge they will 
be logic will become a consistent whole appli 
cable through analogous organs to every subject 
with the full force and perspicuity of reason truth 
and conviction 

 the master mechanician knows that al 
though one instrument may eflect many purposes 
for which it was never intended every work is best 
accomplished by its proper instrument and that 
correct and finished art can be no otherwise at 
tained logic supplies the instruments with which 
reason works the best works are produced in all 
cases by the best and simplest means and logic 
affords no exception to these rules but the constant 
error of logicians has been the multiplication com 
plication and misappliance of defective tools it is 
nevertheless in the simplicity suflsciency and skil 
ful application and not in the display of instruments 
that true science and art are accomplished 

 it is a natural delusion of the human mind 
to regard every material thing all sensations and 
even thoughts as absolute existences or things and 
not as relations or reasons and to name them accor 
dingly hence philosophers have in vain attempted 
to supply a physiological universe to the mind in 
place of a logical one in consequence of which 
they have utterly failed of establishing a truly 
logical system of philosophy and instead of ele 
vating and refining being to intellect have de

graded it into the grossness of materiality or 
framed unstable imaginary systems 

 but as all knowledge is logical every ex 
isting thing is a reason to the mind — whatever 
man can perspect or know or of which he can any 
how have consciousness or conceive truly is a rela 
tiouy individual general or universal the right 
conception or perception of the order of these 
relations is pure logic and thence the whole system 
of truth and man external medial and internal — 
material sensible and intellectual is analogical 
wherein logic and philosophy agree and whatever 
can be brought home to reason is logical 



g we have seen then that logic is universal 
and requires a universal basis which we have else 
where attempted to supply by a synopsis of uni 
versal philosophy wherein we have shown that 
science as a whole is distributable according to 
nature into three great correlative departments 
distinguished as physiological or the science of 
objective things philological or science of sensible 
signsf or words c and the noological or science 
of subjective thoughts the two latter of which are 
intimately connected 

 we have further shewn also that philosophy 
has universally the triple relation of science art

and discipline which distinctions have been con 
founded with much disadvantage to the courses of 
knowledge since some departments proceed better as 
disciplines some as sciences and others as arts 
according as they happen to be more or less appro 
priately either instrumental theoretical or practi 
cal and the logical i e the philological and 
noological departments of knowledge are properly 
to be regarded as connected disciplines all of which 
distinctions reciprocate throughout philosophy 

 in representing logic as a discipline rather 
than bs a science or an arty it is apparent we do 
but follow the natural course and example of the 
chief master of logic among the antients whose 
work the greatest ever produced on the subject 
bears the title of organon which was also adopted 
by the greatest of modem logicians for his novum 
organum and the very name of organ signifying 
an instrument denotes a discipline we have not 
scrupled therefore to give this name also to the 
analogism the universal instrument of logic as a 
discipline 

 logicians have notwithstanding regarded 
logic as a science or an art and sometimes as both 
these although it is not strictly either but is as 
geometry arithmetic c are a discipline and 
instrument of art and science yet are they as 
every branch of knowledge is susceptible of treat 
ment either as science art or discipline or as all 
of these together

 introduction 

 according to the foregoidg views our pur 
pose is to treat of logic on a universal basis 
extending to the entire signification of the term as 
derived from the greek aoy — from aoyo reason 
and speech and agygv to say and therefore to 
signify logic may hence be defined the discipline 
and art of argument and discourse or otherwise 
the science of thinking and conveying thought 
and thus it extends to all literary art we intend 
accordingly to treat thereof as philological and 
logical whence our outline will involve both the 
principles of words and of reasoning which are 
not only naturally but necessarily connected as 
signification and connect as logical what have 
usually been treated for convenience as distinct 
sciences namely grammar rfietoric and logic 
including therewith the whole of the philological 
sciences and semiotics or the science of signification 

 it will be at once perceived that our plan 
is a return to the trivium of the schools not 
indeed to treat the diflerent branches after the 
manner of the schools but in such a manner as to 
ensure the attainment of another sort of logic and 
critic than what we have been hitherto acquainted 
with convinced that the study of grammar or 
philology is an indispensable preliminary to logict

treatises of his organon comprises first uni 
versal termsj secondly the construction of sen 
tences and thirdly syllogisms — the first in his 
treatise on the categories the second in that 
 on interpretations and the last in his ana 
lytics of the latter the prior analytics treat 
of demonstration of terms propositions and syl 
logisms the posterior analytics treat of argu 
ment through syllogism analogy or comparison 
induction and ahduction in the topics he 
treats of prohable arguments and finally of 
sophism or fallacies in his sophistical elenchi 
— first as grammatical secondly as logical and 
thirdly as rhetorical 

such was the undoubted source of the trivium 
the departure from which may be regarded as an 
error in discipline 

logic then in its full extent involves letters 
words propositions organs and discourse 

 the aristotelian logic is essentially that 
of the mathematician — they proceed alike the 
simplest elements of letters are the simplest forms 
of geometry and the simplest sounds of harmonics 
both of which as mathematical terminate only in 
the infinite ratios of logical reason proceeding 
from the simplest sign to the highest point or 
extreme of signification through which literature 
represents the philosophic universe and logic in 
a corresponding whole 

 thus all discursive science and discourse

 introduction 

are composed of propositions connected as all pro 
positions consist of words connected and as words 
consist of literal signs sonorous connected so are 
propositions compound signs and perfect discourse 
consists of complex signification connected in logi 
cal unity it follows that logic is grammatical 
and grammar logical inseparably whence the 
logical and philological sciences constitute a co 
essential whole and as such should be treated of in 
connexion and the latter in subordination to the 
former as the instrument of thought which is the 
counterpart of things 

 hence again logic is the correlative of 
philosophy the first comprehending the universe 
subjectively the latter objectively in reference to 
the matter of which the former supplies the forms 
connecting them according to immutable relations 
in one identical system 

 such are the general views under which we 
proceed first to lay down our plan of philological 
science as a whole in the execution of which we 
shall restrain inquiry throwing aside whatever may 
embarrass more than illustrate the ground work and 
releasing the whole from the inexpedient technical 
ities with which the logical disciplines have been 
obstructed while we innovate as little as possible 
we do not pretend however to render abstruse 
subjects popular any more than to produce a logic

individual can hope but to attempt it is a duty all 
we propose is to survey the ground and trace the

or 



the analogy of language 



chapter i 
introduction 



 having shown that logic and philosophy 
are universal systems diflfering only in view as 
suhjective and ohjective and that philology which 
is the science of language and perspective of both 
these systems is essentially logical and that the 
three comprehend in universal relation words 
thoughts and things analogically we proceed to 
inquire into the logical relations of language or 
philology 

 in commencing such inquiry we embark 
on an ocean which inspheres the whole world — 
not of nature alone but of art science and dis 
cipline nor is it confined to the system of reality 
and truth only but extends to things the most

fictitious and arbitrary and grasping time and 
space connects the present with the future and the 
past while it is the medium of commerce and 
communication between men and nations not only 

 speeding soft intercourse from soul to soul 
and wafting sighs from indus to the pole 

but conveying precepts to the unborn and bearing 
immortal instructions from the dead 

 it is by thus uniting men and ages that 
language has given to man the highest station 
among created beings but for which he had 
remained to the end of time one only among the 
beasts of the earth through the instrumentality of 
language however all the faculties of the indi 
vidual are extended the species becomes a great 
individual and man a communicant with god 

 such are the powers and capacity of lan 
guage which is at the same time that department 
of the system of man wherein he exercises his 
faculties most diversely with least of the aid of 
nature and science which are the same for all 
men while language varies not only with nations 
and communities but with parties with indivi 
duals and even with times occasions and modes 
of expressions 

 it is hence that language has the earliest 
claim upon the attention of mankind and that 
whatever in the progress of philology brings 
language nearer to universality brings it nearer

to science and truth which are its objects nor 
is this unimportant to the happiness of mankind 
since nations will think more alike when they think 
in similar language and will better understand 
each other and more readily communicate every 
good as members of one family under the same 
father and not regard each other as alien foreign 
helot or barbarian an amelioration of the species 
now evidently in progress 

 if these remarks appear exuberant they 
are meant to shew the magnitude and perplexity 
of our subject and how difficult it must be to 
attain satisfactorily the true natural principles 
relations and references of a topic so wonderfully 
comprehensive fluctuating and diversified for 
which also the superabundance of literary matter 
is rather a hinderance than a help 

 it is true nevertheless that the genius 
of many eminent grammarians has tended with a 
philosophic spirit toward the universal principles 
of language so far as regards the grammar of 
written speech and therein they afford us some 
aid but this extends to a small portion only of 
the entire system of representation which goes to 
every possible mode and manner of communicating 
knowledge and embraces the system of philosophy 
and science universally which in its turn can 
alone conduct us to the true relations and outline 
of philology or the genuine ground and elements 
of signification and the true analogy of language

 philology or 

 as so wide an investigation lies however 
beyond the commonly acknowledged bounds of 
this subject and far exceeds the line of mere 
utility a very brief outline may here suffice for 
evincing this universal philosophic connexion and 
for bringing our subject into bearing with the 
general analogy of language upon the foundation 
of nature so as to afford at the same time the 
widest possible basis of utility 

 we shall not need therefore to enter into 
the voluminous particulars and endless discussions 
of the learned in languages nor very widely into 
the inductions of the universal grammarians phi 
lologists ethnologists and etymologists for these 
are but branches and foliage to the tree of which 
we seek the root the comparative ease however 
of tracing these ramifications their luxuriance and 
the facility with which they have conducted to 
literary reputation and academic honours although 
achievements more of labour than of skill or in 
tellect may have been the temptations to which 
we owe the bulk of philology and the preference 
the learned have shewn for this study to the 
neglect of logic and philosophy although with 
little effect so far at least as regards its found 
ation as a science while it is to be regretted that 
learnings in particular has been reduced to mere 
linguau symbolical and philological attainment in 
the study of the least instructive portion of the 
greek and roman classics thus preferring as

it were a dwelling in ancient ruins to the laying 
of solid foundations and building of noble struc 
tures for her own abode 

 it adds to these temptations which learning 
has to found philology upon words alone inde 
pendently of thoughts and things — upon sense 
rather than upon reason on the one hand or 
nature on the other or in other words to trace 
signification not logically and analogically through 
identity of relation or philosophically through 
understanding but rather through sense by the 
very uncertain and opposite process of etymologies 
and traditions — that it admits a flattering and 
ostentatious display of erudition which astounds 
more than it instructs while the rational process 
terminates in naked simplicity and demands a 
degree and kind of intellectual exertion and at 
tention both in the conception and reception to 
which minds are but too commonly repugnant 

 we dispute not however the benefits 
which arise from the labours of the etymologists 
and grammarians so far as they may coincide 
with elucidate and confirm the aim of philosophy 
etymology gives stability to language by disclosing 
the sources of words and it does more so when 
it points out their relations but in seeking their 
originals pedantry has often employed false and 
too remote derivations and substituted similitudes 
of sound for analogies of reason the source of a 
word is of much less importance than its relations

and signification and is of secondary concern 
therefore even with the etymologist with whom 
that which illustrates the latter is to be preferred 
to that which explicates the former and that which 
is nearer is preferable to that which is remote or 
beyond the compass or usage of the language 
itself 

 yet little has been done systematically by 
the learned to afford a truly philosophic form of 
philology to which our outline may nevertheless 
contribute somewhat and serve as an introduction 
to our logic in accordance with the ancient synthetic 
method which founds syllogisms upon words and 
sentences and philosophy upon logic in the order 
of words thoughts and things a method probably 
resorted to upon the consideration that words which 
are last in philosophical analysis are first in the 
communication of thought or knowledge — it is 
accordingly the method of discipline and there 
fore we have adopted it in this place 

 but we regard the analytical method as 
most truly scientific doctrinal and perspicuous 
while the method of synthesis belongs to art and 
practical discipline and is necessarily laborious and 
obscure well therefore might aristotle who 
followed this method assure his pupil alexander 
that he had published and not published his doc 
trines veiled as they were by synthesis from 
which the scholastics of after times never emerged

amid smoke disciples of extraordinary brightness 
who kept alive the smothered fire of philosophy 

 by neither of these methods can we hope 
to clear comprehension from all obscurity in a 
thing of such utter confusion and diversity as 
language and literature and may be well content 
if we can open a way or throw a new light 
thereon which may assist us in conducting the 
inquiries of philosophy and laying a foundation for 
logic 

 in the communication of knowledge words 
precede and hence it is that in logical and mathe 
matical disciplines definition precedes argument 
and argument precedes demonstration while logic 
is inseparable from philology as thoughts are from 
words accordingly the greek term logos oyoiy 
before remarked on from which they are derived 
justly and philosophically signifies both word and 
thought as in like manner discourse and dis 
cursive denote reasoning speech and communi 
cation and have both a logical and philological 
import 

 philologjy therefore presents itself as the 
first discipline and is the instrument of logicy as 
logic is of the mathematics and as the three to 
gether are of all knowledge whether it be of science 
or of art

which is first disclosed and that upon which de 
pends the acquisition of language which again 
is the first subject of education and that upon 
which all knowledge is dependent not however 
to be cultivated at the expense of the higher func 
tions of the mind as languages are in ordinary 
education since the understanding is strictly a 
capacity which being surcharged with these stores 
of memory becomes incapacitated for other and 
more important acquisitions nor is ever any human 
faculty unduly cultivated but with a proportionate 
sacrifice of the rest 

 it appears to us that an erroneous opinion 
on the reform of learning is now prevalent with 
regard to education and the colleges which are 
not properly places for teaching arts and sciences 
but for disciplines there was therefore sound 
judgment in the scholastics who adopted the tri 
vium of grammar rhetoric and logic with the 
mathematical quadrivium of arithmetic music 
geometry and mechanics or pythagorean disci 
plines as the solid foundation of education and as 
instruments of economical and social use for appli 
cation in the sciences and arts 

 the superficial teaching of the latter by 
lectures may serve for illustration and recreations

knowledges into disciplines sciences and arts are 
important to the due propagation and progress of 
intelligence and learning 

 as the purpose of the ensuing sketch is 
chiefly concerned with the form of philology in 
relation to logical science we need not enter deeply 
into the history and ethnography of language and 
the various stages of literary progress and inven 
tion that the first characters employed in written 
language were hieroglyphics or picture language 
which represent objects by their figures and co 
lours there can be little doubt and it is confirmed 
by historical testimony and that letters which 
characterize sounds and are of general significa 
tion by compact were of later invention and gave 
the first scientific form to language and uterature 
is of as little doubt 

 these are the figurate extremes of written 
characters between which are symbolic characters 
or signs of words which are intermediate to alpha 
betical characters and pictures of things and such 
are the chinese literary characters 

 it is evident also that other intermediate 
characters have been employed and that literation 
has been wholly progressive of this we have 
examples preserved in the bodleian library and 
others recently copied by mr catherwoods faithful 
pencil from the table of a stone altar of an extinct 
nation araong the ruins of copan and palenque in

and himself this tahle is inscribed with cha 
racters tessellated half picture and half symbol 
between and resembling both the hieroglyphs of 
egypt and the chinese characters and the sides 
of the altar are surrounded with wellexecuted 
sculptures in high relief of crosslegged figures 
resembling the deities of the hindoo mythology 
and indicating an early period and eastern origin 
china and mexico being opposite coasts of the 
pacific linked together by a chain of islands 

 during the periods of written characters 
prior to the invention of alphabetical signs when 
pictures and symbols of words were employed for 
correspondence and communication of knowledge 
language was in a state analogous to that of com 
merce previously to the invention of coin and credit 
as general signs of value and things were bartered 
in kind — states in which neither the riches of 
mind nor body could abound nor correspondents 
in either possess capital for exchange or specu 
lation 

 contrary to all reason and authority some 
learned men would regard the hieroglyph as an 
ultimate refinement thus vossius asserts that 
the first discipline of the egyptians is threefold — 
 the vulgar or epistolographic used in corre 
sponding the hieratic used in civic records 
and the hieroglyphic or sacred symbols t

whence it is conjectured that the hieroglyph repre 
sents neither words nor letters hut entire discourse 
or sentences should they however represent 
variously all of thesoy it may account for the little 
progress hitherto made in deciphering them 

 in the construction and composition of 
language as of letters there can be but little 
doubt also that poetry which merely figures and 
symbolizes knowledge is more ancient than prose 
which literalizes it the first in each case aggre 
gates concretes and particularizes the latter dis 
tributes abstracts and generalizes hence the 
former of each is more technical the latter more 
scientific and philosophical but the first are here 
only of incidental inquiry whether language was 
the result of a natural progress or an immediate 
divine communication are questions we leave never 
theless to the determination of ethnographers and 
divines although we are assured by sacred writ 
that whatsoever adam called every living crea 
ture that was the name thereof we incline 
however to the opinion of the human origin of 
language because in all refinement of art there is 
an apparent tendency to elementary simplicity and 
this especially in literary art through which other 
arts are advanced and perfected in a similar 
manner

to letters or characters of sounds these hy a 
like process of refinement the grammarians dis 
tinguish as vocal and consonant simplifying the 
first into elementary tones and figures at which 
simplicity and refinement cease and nature and art 
terminate analytically 

 alphabetical characters are however 
traced by others to egyptian learning many letters 
of the hebrew being found among the egyptian 
symbols or hieroglyphics in which they had literal 
use and employment and it is feasible that moses 
obtained them thence and formed the first alphabet 
or adopted the analogous coptic and rejected the 
hieroglyphics as of idolatrous character thereby 
acting with superior wisdom and advancing biblical 
learning whereon the alphabetical literature is 
foimded and spread itself throughout the east 
but if the hieroglyph were to be regarded as an 
ultimate refinement and learning as revolving in a 
cycle then might the present fashion arising in 
literature of pictural illustrations in place of text 
be absurdly regarded as the recommencement of a 
new cycle in which a more perfect picture language 
as destructive as the hieroglyphs were to fine art 
is destined to supply the place of literation

 refinement in characters as in literary 
composition is however marked by simplicity of 
construction and it is by analogy of languages that 
the general principles are disclosed through which 
language itself may become universal and indi 
vidual dialects refined and of living languages 
there is none better qualified for universality by 
elementary simplicity and convertibility than our 
own philosophic dialect 

 the english is a language admirably 
adapted to precision and perspicuity — rich and 
copious above all in the abundance of words 
and variety of roots while it is the most natu 
ral and simple in structure — widest in relation 
to other languages — widespread throughout the 
earth and universal in application partaking of the 
free spirit of its people and although like them 
not free from errors and anomalies it is self

philology 



 it has been shewn in our synopsis that 
knowledge universal implies a universal mode of 
being or physiological science — a universal mode 
of receiving or logical science — and a universal 
mode of conveying or philological science the 
first referring to the matter and object — the second 
to the form and subject — and the last to the repre 
sentation sign or interpretation of knowledge or 
the medium by which the mind or subject receives 
and conveys knowledge or thought 

 as the subject is of internal or intrinsic 
reference and the object is of external or extrinsic 
reference so is the representation of medial or 
intermediate reference and the latter is thence 
principally related to sense as distinguished from 
matter and intelligence accordingly sense sup 
plies the representing medium and sign of all 
knowledge of things which are the objects of phy 
siology and of thoughts which belong to the logical 
subject it has therefore a triple reference — sub 
jective objective and representative of which the

first or subjective reference of philology being the 
logic of signs is the principal in our present view 

 as the elements of physiology and logic 
are powers and faculties so are those of philology 
and such are the senses as limited with regard to 
knowledge of which senses feeling is the genus 
and touchy sights and sound are the species which 
as respects philology or the mode or means of 
conveying knowledge are efficient of all language 
or philological operation 

 strictly speaking therefore every sensa 
tion is but the sign of the thing it represents so 
that sensation is the natural universal language of 
sensible beings by which kriowledge is received and 
communicated and as knowledge is communicated 
artificially and conventionally only by figures or 
characters and sounds and figure though imme 
diately belonging to touch is mediately cognisable 
by the sense of sight the language of art refers 
but to the two senses of sight and sound 

 and since the arbitrary language of art is 
that of the first conveyance of philosophic know 
ledge we may pass by the remainder of the infinite 
untrodden field of philological science wherein 
every sense may be rendered significant of thoughts 
and things as it is also capable of representing 
interpreting and conveying all knowledge 

 whence all language commences from 
signs of sensible objects and their relations which 
are transferred by metaphor and figure to the being

and relations of moral and mental subjects through 
a universal analogy whereby physical and meta 
physical relations are identified with various degrees 
of proximity or remoteness by terms equally appli 
cable to both whence the general relations of 
number time space motion c have a double 
signification extending to the particular qualities 
of things and throughout language the source of 
figurative and poetical imagery but which when 
not distinguished in the use of words renders them 
ambiguous and gives rise to logical differences and 
dispute 

 it is to the reciprocation and analogy of 
the parts of the universal system remarkable 
throughout that each sense owes its power of re 
presenting and conveying the entire system of 
knowledge hence we have entire languages of 
sound or articulate langimge and corresponding 
language of figures or characters or written ian 
guagby which is silent and we have these also 
united 

 according to the same reciprocation or 
analogy the various powers of each distinct sense 
are also capable of constituting distinct languages 
hence colour which belongs to sight forms no part 
of written language and note or music which 
belongs to sound has no necessary connexion with 
speech yet languages might be constructed of 
note and colour as they are constituted to the 
dumb and in the mimes of the antients and

add indeed much signification to all speech nay 
both reason and authority go to prove the possi 
bility of tangible and even gustatory and olfkctory 
languages to say nothing of the languages of 
signals and machines 

 and since there is a natural constitution 
of figure and sound which is of universal relation 
and analogy and of unbounded scope there is a 
perfect natural constitution offigurate characters 
and articulate sounds and a capability or poten 
tiality for a boundless variety of artificial characters 
and speech and from hence springs the variety 
of langmiges 

 to this variability and fecundity of lan 
guage may be attributed that chief cause of philo 
sophic instability and controversy which lies in the 
fluctuation confusion and imperfections of arti 
ficial language of which it is our present business 
to trace the natural and scientific relations and 
to reconcile in particular with the system of 
logic 

 language then as spoken and tarittenf 
refers to sounds and characters as above limited 
and also as coinciding with each other or unit

therefore the elements of artificial languages and

 the egyptian hieroglyph or symbol of 
speech or language is said to have been a tongue 
with an ee and a hand placed beieath it and it 
has been variously interpreted — that the eye as 
being most expressive next to the tongue was put 
beneath it and the hand added as executing its 
orders — uhat the eye and hand were placed 
with the tongue in this symbol on account of their 
powers in oratory tec be tese as they may 
this hieroglyph of the egyptians appears to be a 
most expressive symbol of language as spoken by 
the tongue read by the eye and written by the 
hand in the triple reference of vision sound and 
gesture 

 in the simplest combination of characters 
with sounds they constitute letters which are 
the elements of words or names of thoughts and 
things of which sentences or propositions and all 
language are composed and this agrees with 
and confirms the subgenera or species of phu 
hhgy of which we have before indicated the 
position and universal relations namely semiotics 
which treat of literal signs or letters orammatics 
or inflection which treat of names and words

 to this representation of the powers of

as ooy in wood you know says socrates in 
the cratylus of plato that our ancestors very 
frequently used the i and d hut now instead 
of the i they perversely use either the s or 
and i instead of a socrates alludes here to the 
ancient cadmean alphabet in which the i answered 
to the hehrew and phoenician jody and the e was 
sounded like the bleat of a sheep as we now im 
properly pronounce the a in english the o of 
the same alphabet whether long or short had but 
this one character and corresponded to the hebrew 
and phoenician oin 

 that the greeks so sounded these vowels 
we may gather also from the order in which they 
employed them in singing the ra r ri rs to the 
notes of their tetrachord as the modem musicians 
less regularly employ them in the monosyllables 
mty juy soly icly scc iu solmiscuion and it is 
apparent that the general order of the alphabet 
partakes of this musical analogy of the vowels as 
denoted in the table 

 the secondary vowels e y and u are 
double vocal sounds or diphthongsy when they as 
sume not the simple power of the primary vowels 
this is evinced with regard to u when it is the 
initial of any word preceded by the indefinite 
article a which according to the rule should

in spite of the rule the ear can hardly endure the 
pedantic an any more than it can the article a

ear will allow although by custom and habit the 
ear will tolerate any cacophony as whoever saw 
an unicorn and y is allowed to be as frequently 
consonant as vocal yet old writers used an before 
y as frequently as we now do before u thus an 
gears banishment c but the usage in both 
will be dropt when we cease to affect rule against 
nature 

 these remarks apply also in some cases 
to the primary vowels thus in the word one the 
is a diphthong or consonant equivalent to w and 
the ear can hardly tolerate the regular article pre 
ceding it hence to an unprejudiced ear such a 
one is preferable to such an one and before the 
two vowels or diphthong eu we use the article a 
and say a european c 

 grammarians by rendering their rules 
universal contrarily to natural usage while they seem 
to refine a language and render it more regular 
learned and scientific destroy its melody and it 
is to the exceptions or temperament of rules with 
a correct knowledge thereof that many of the graces 
of a proficient practice in every art belong and as 
we have no invariable vowels so we cannot justly 
govern them by invariable rules

 upon the same principle the article a 
should hecome an before any word which begins 
with a silent consonant preceding a vowel thus 
before a silent a as an hour c although the 
an is sometimes employed in robbing us of our 
aspirate a correct ear will however guide us 
aright in all such cases of euphony and our in 
definite article assisted by the ear is an infallible 
test for determining whether any letter it precedes 
is sounded as a vowel or a consonant except 
indeed such letter stand alone for in such case 
every vocal consonant including the liquids will 
require an before it for example an fy an h 
l mi nf i sf and an x but all the mutes will 
in the same case require the a prefixed thus 
ab a c a q k p q t f w and 
a z 

 it appears therefore that there are letters 
which are intermediates of the vowel and con 
sonant although in strictness there are neither 
absolutely mute consonants nor perfectly vocal 
vowels but every letter partakes of the vocal and 
the mute as musical sounds partake of sound and 
silence acuteness and gravity as their extreme 
principles or light and shade

consonants c to the three primary vowels may 
be traced throughout our alphabet as in the fol

racters as graphic or visual now the earliest 
attempt at literary or epistolographic communi 
cation or writing seems to have been by the 
figures of particular things or pictural represent 
ations as among the aboriginal mexicans the 
hieroglyphs of the antient egyptians were inter 
mediates of such representations and the more 
general symbols of the chinese and the next step 
from these symbols of words being to universal 
signs afibrded letters such as they appear in the 
sanscrit characters which bear a decided resem 
blance to the more complex characters of the 
chinese and are the farthest removed from the 
more simple characters of modem alphabets which 
finally approach the pure elementary figures of 
geometry 

 thus the natural progress of written lan 
guage is a generalising logical process from symbols 
of particular things to symbols of general signs 
words and thoughts and thence to symbols of 
sounds or universal alphabetical signs of which we 
have attempted the analysis thus the philolo 
gical and the logical progress of man from par 
ticulars to universals from the segregate to the 
abstract are the same 

 regarding letters then as visual namely 
in their written or figurate characters there should 
be in nature and science a foundation for them 
also as systematic as for their vocal sounds for 
they are geometrical forms or figures which have

elements also in the same respects as sounds have 
and though there may seem less connexion between 
natural forms and the figures of letters than there 
is between natural and artificial sounds yet it is a 
remarkable coincidence with our view that the 
three primary vowels in the magogian and other 
antient languages as well as in the grecian and 
roman characters i o a are of the three pri 
mary forms the line the circle and the angle of 
which all other linear figures geometrical and 
literal are only variations or compounds 

 so again the letter y appears to be a 
compound both in sound and figure of the v and 
l again by opening a to a right angle and 
adding the letter to it at the bottom e is in 
like manner composed and x is nearly a com 
pound of o and i or v and i whence the vowels 
as secondary both in figure and sound seem to be 
produced by compounding their primaries inter 
changeably 

 a particular investigation of the characters 
of the various antient and modern alphabets might 
supply other similar coincidences not that either 
the figures or sounds of letters were really ori 
ginated as above notwithstanding the possibility 
thereof but that they became such in time

and contrivances of man are biased evincing that 
art in man is at its origin furthest removed from 
the practice and perfection of nature to which the 
artist in the end attains progressively refining and 
purifying practice to the simplicity of nature ac 
cordingly the vowel sounds were not distinguished 
by the inventors of the alphabet nor in the earliest 
languages but this was principally reserved for 
the greeks who all but attained the simplicity and 
perfection of nature therein 

 on the whole the alphabet may be re 
garded as a shorthand in which a few characters 
serve by combination to express an unlimited num 
ber of ideas and things by an abridgement of 
figurate signs and a classification of vocal sounds 
coincident in their elements whereby the i a o of 
geometry represent the i a o of the alphabet

sounds 

i we have profiered these remarks to shew 
that there is a natural and real analogy between 
the figures and sounds of letters no less than that 
which has arisen accidentally or been assumed by 
grammarians and the natural tendency of language 
and its progress toward the simple vocal sounds 
of the harmonic chord and primary geometrical 
figures in the three vowels i o a might be

the analogy of accents 

 so much with regard to vocal signs and 
characters or letters next to which are semi 
vocal characters or accents which are signs related 
to the first composition of letters in syllables and 
words after which follow mute characters or 
points which relate to the composition of words in 
sentences — both of which are of logical and gram 
matical reference as modificative of signification 
to the two latter orders of characters belong 
accentuation and punctuation both of which are 
of grecian origin and triple analogy and of each 
a very brief analysis may here suffice 



section ii 

 accentuation comprehends three distinct 
characters and their offices — the acute accent 
which marks elevation of voice j the grave accent 
 which marks depression and the drcumjlex 
accent in which the other two forms are 
conjoined and denote continuity of voice rise and 
fell or the double cadence of acute and grave of 
simple sounds with respect to note or tone 

 but accent belongs not only to letters and 
syllables but also to words and sentences and then 
it takes the name of emphasis it belongs finally 
also to themes and emphatic sentences which in 
printing are distinguished by italics capitals and

 philology or 

large capitals as they are in maduscript by single 
double and triple underlines by all of which the 
logical and grammatical value and significations of 
letters words and sentences are variously affected 
in signification 

 there are also accents of quantity with 
regard to time which are either longj shorty or 
mean of which two only require marking namely 
the long accent — and the short accent w 
and these relate to all the varieties of metre 



section iil 

 finally punctuation which belongs to 
the composition of words and sentences has also 
three principal characters — the period which 
marks and terminates an entire sentence or period j 
the comma which denotes its simplest member 
or division and the semicolon in which the 
two preceding characters or points are combined 
for dividing compound periods denoting a half 
period or member 

 as to the colon or double period 
which denotes conjunction of illustrative matter 
to a period already complete it is a note of con 
junction similar to the note of interrogation 

which is formed of the initial q of query 
placed over the period at the end of a question

and the note of admiration is formed by ac 
centing the period to mark an emphatic 
sentence or expression all of which are sufsiciently 
expressive signs these points have often the 
powers of words the comma being conjmictiye the 
semicolon prepositive and the period disjunctive 
others are interrogative and interjective and de 
rive hence considerable grammatical rhetorical 
and logical signification 

 punctuation which is analogous to the 
pauses or rests in music and similarly regulated 
has however in strictness a wider reference and 
may be sensibly denoted by spaces of difperent 
lengths in the manner of those used in the separa 
tion of words which were originally written con 
tinuously in lines without separation of any kind 
or the common points may be substituted by vari 
ous lengths of the line or dash — as it some 
times is or by the positions of a point or period 
at the top bottom or middle of the letter as was 
once the practice 

 the dash is also used to denote the omis 
sion of words and then it is called an ellipsis as 
it is also to bound a parenthesis — thus — for which 
purpose brackets and crotchets are commonly em 
ployed thus and thus as are also commas 
 thus in which use commas would be better in 
serted as they are in marking quotations by in 
verting the first comma thus thus — or inserting 
instead thereof the spiritus asper thus

 besides these there is opposed to the 
parenthesis the caret a employed to mark the 
place of introduction of any words in manuscript 
also the hyphen for connecting of syllables 
and compounding of words c and the brace 
 variously employed for connecting the 
especially related members of discourse of these 
as of all literary signs and characters simplicity of 
form and natural indication is the perfection such 
as is the hand l for pointing out some matter 
for especial notice or attention 

 many other arbitrary signs and abbreyiates 
are employed in literature which being of less 
general reference are better suited to a universal 
and practical treatise on semiotics — a desideratum 
in literature pregnant with utility to this subject 
belongs literary notation of which we have spoken 
elsewhere 

 ah literary punctuation is employed in 
aid of sense and expression but as these are 
literally illimitable the points in use do little more 
than mark the chief divisions and termination of 
sentences to the eye and leave the many shades of 
expression through pauses to the judgment taste 
and discretion of the reader so that the times 
usually assigned to mark pauses— as one two

are by no means invariable but are or ought to

 so much for semiotics as the science of 
simple signs or points accents and letters but 
wordsy which are the suhject of grammar are 
compound signs also and therefore are a part of 
semiotics as letters are a part of grammar as 
its name expresses so also sentences and pro 
positions which are the subject of syntax are 
complex signs and belong also to semiotics and 
to grammar and there can be no absolute sepa 
ration of the three for they are coessential and 
the whole of philology is the science of signifi 
cation hence also the figures of rhetoric and 
prosody which arise as subjects of syntax are 
semiotic and the metaphor and comparison are 
signs and poetry throughout is symbolical hence 
these divisions of philology are employed not as 
absolute but for easier elucidation and analysis 
as relative regulative and subordinate to logic 

 orthography which antiently signified 
the art of writing now means the art of forming 
words or spelling with letters and is a conven 
tional practice with us which requires the regu 
lation of art and is here the link of connexion 
between semiotics and grammar

 philology or 



chapter iv 



grammar 



 the second literary or philological science 
is grammar which in common acceptation ex 
tends to the whole of philology but denotes here 
the science of the nature and relations of words or 
terms only and has been in a practical view not 
ineptly defined the art of expressing the relations 
of things by words as distinguished from syn 
tax it is called inflexion 

 of simple articulate signs or letters are 
composed syllables which are compound vocal 
sounds each including one primary vowel and no 
more with its consonants and also words or names 
which are compound articulations resolvable into 
as many syllables as they contain simple vocal arti 
culations or vowels and are significant of things 
or of thoughts or of the relations of thoughts and 
things and upon these therefore depend the lo 
gical and reciprocal relations of terms 

 but as thoughts and things when com 
pounded are very different from the individual

the analogy of words 

thoughts or things of which they are composed 
so are the significations of the words by which 
they are represented equally changed by compo 
sition from their individual significations however 
they may participate and retain in some degree 
their original meanings hence the necessity to 
a perfectly clear communication of knowledge of a 
systematic analogy and correspondence between 
words and thoughts as between thoughts and 
things and of an entire and systematic agreement 
of the whole 

 words are simple or monosyllables or 
they are compounds of two or more syllables and 
as every syllable has a principal sound or vowel 
through which it is articulated so every compound 
word has a principal vowel and the syllable con 
taining it is predominant and accentiuited in such 
words and is or should be that syllable to which 
a word owes its chief signification 

 in like manner every sentence enuncia 
tion or proposition has its principal word predo 
minant or emphatic sound determined by its chief 
signification for the emphasis is determined by the 
sense of a sentence and if the elements or mem 
bers of a syllable word or sentence are complex 
or numerous they have not only the predominance 
of powers spoken of but they have also a subor 
dination of secondary powers in their articulation 
accentuation and emphasis so analogous is na 
ture and genuine art in constituting systematic

logical wholes of their minutest as in their greater 
works 

 although signiicalion properly determines 
both accent and emphasis yet accent chiefly de 
pends upon the ear and emphasis upon the un 
derstanding and inasmuch as the signification of 
words is fixed and that of sentences depends upon 
the speaker accent and emphasis differ the full 
force of expression nevertheless depends upon their 
union or coalescence 

 so much for sound and as to signifi 
cation which is principal in words the logician 
knows that every perfect proposition consists of 
something asserted of something it therefore 
simply discloses a relation or connective of two 
things — the one in a philological sense being a 
subject the other an attribute and all that can 
be asserted may be delivered in and resolved into 
these simple propositions consisting of three words 
or terms 

 it is clear therefore that there can be 
no other relations of words or simple parts of 
speech however variously they may be distin 
guished by grammarians than subjectivest or 
nounssubstantive attributives or nounsadjec 
tive called of old adnames or adnouns and

pounded as tooke has in many instances satis 
factorily proved 

 so again substance or essence and re 
kttionj are philosophical universals and logical cate 
gories and as they are thus ohjectively as well as 
suhjectively universal so also must they be repre 
sentatively universal hence the substantive and 
relative are the true universal generic distinctions 
of words or parts of speech comprehending all 
others 

 accordingly all words are either names 
of objective beings or things or names of subjec 
tive relations or thoughts or finally they are 
names of representative signs or words the first 
are called nouns substantive the second nouns 
adjective or attributive and the last the pronoun 
and verb — that is the noun relative or connec 
tive and these correspond to the subject predicate 
and copula of logic and their common nature is 
expressed by the term noun or name under which 
they are reciprocally convertible 

 as both logically and philosophically we 
know nothing more of thoughts and things than 
their relations all words are names expressive of 
relations therefore there are no other words or 
parts of speech than nouns or nominatives and

relations or relatives and the variety of the latter 
are significant of the various relations of the things 
designated thus while the noun or nominative 
is unchangeable the relations expressed by it are 
denoted by inflexion or additions of predicates and 
the richer a language is in auxiliaries and particles 
denoting these the more expressive it is but a 
perfect language must obviously depend on a per 
fect knowledge of universal relations and therefore 
universal philosophy logic and language are 
reciprocally coessential and analogous 

 it is apparent then that words are re 
latively convertible whence substantives by pre 
dication become adjectives thus gold becomes 
golden and impiety impious c so adjectives 
by subjection become substantives thus good be 
comes goodness c some words are both sub 
stantives and adjectives and others are at once 
all parts of speech according as they may happen 
to be employed thus we say whitelead or lead 
white white chalk or chalk white or these 
words become verbs as to chalk to white or 
whiten c 

 so again verbs become substantives or 
adjectives thus to hate becomes hatred and 
hatejvl c and the verbsubstantive and verb 
adjective called participles are verbs either sub 
jected or predicated thus to hate becomes hating 
and hated c and so on interchangeably of all

words which like all thoughts and all things are 
relatives to distinguish or to connect and not 
absolutes 

 further participles are either verb 
substantives verbadjectivesy or adverbs and be 
come such by being verbs either subjected pre 
dicated or compared as to love becomes loving 
present existing or in act — loved past and lovely 
at all times and thus adverbs are participles 
partaking of the noun and verb adverbs are also 
words adjected or attributed and when applied to 
verbs or adjectives are compound attributives and 
are called by harris attributives of attributives 

 hence the verb which has been dignified 
with preeminence among words appears to involve 
or combine the logical powers of the subject and 
predicate with the grammatical powers of the sub 
stantive and adjective and thereby to become a 
true medium or copula for uniting subjects and 
predicates in conjoint signification or discourse 
accordingly the verb is a substantive or subject 
with the adjuncts or adjects of time or tense 
number case gender figure c which rela 
tions are denoted by certain abbreviate auxiliaries 

• in the language of the north american indians instead 
of the distinctions of gender they use distinctions of genera — 
i e animate and inanimate with them every thing is he or

general and indefinite or universal — see buchanan on the

inflexions or terminations c the employment 
of which while it has contributed to the brevity 
facility and grace of language has been the means 
of concealing the true nature and office of the 
verb 

 it is apparent then that the verb is the 
cement of language and the principal of connec 
tives among which it is included with the con 
junction adjective adverb preposition c all 
of which latter parts of speech the ancient san 
scrit grammarians justly considered as indeclinable

differ from the most approved authorities including 
primarily aristotles who in his treatise of inter 
pretation begins by distinguishing language into 
noun and verb and afterwards calls verbs nouns 
having the attributives of connexion time c 

 as the verb is the principal connective 
and cement of language it is universal or cate 
gorical and consequently it expresses both existence 
and relation whence the power of the auxiliary 
verb to be belongs to every verb and as existence 
implies action of which time is the most general 
form so time is also a universal attribute by which 
every verb is modified and these interpret the 
entire office of the verb with respect to time and

connexion and explain why the expressing of re 
lation is essential to the verb and that of existence 
or time is an attribute only 

 it may be worthy of remark here that all 
the verbal attributes of time number case gender 
and person have been triply distinguished time 
as past present and future number as singular 
dual and plural case as nominative genitive 
and objective gender as masculine feminine and 
neuter and person as first second and third so 
prone are words to adapt themselves to the rela 
tions of thoughts and things and the universal 
analogy of nature 

 moods of verbs are of logical importance 
corresponding to the variety of propositions as 
indicative imperative and interrogative or opta 
tive which again divide into others the impera 
tive affording the potential and subjunctive as the 
indicative does the infinitive but natural regula 
tion requires only the three first distinctions and 
strictly we have no others in english though we 
can easily express them all 

 these attributes are traceable to universal 
predicaments and the whole grammar of words is 
iccal and its true distribution also categorical 
thus words as to kind are either substantives 
according to the category of substance — in respect 
to that of quality they are adjectives — and accord

affirmations while particles include the minor

 again — as nouns substantive denote 
either genus species or individuals so nouns 
adjective may be called dejinitivesj their office 
being to attribute the generic specific and in 
dividual differences of nouns substantive briefly 
according to true logical definition for like 
reason harris has given the name definitive to the 
article because it individuates or determines the 
substantive 

 pursuing still the logical and analogical 
distinctions of words as signs they are either par

are proper names of individuals if general they 
are common namesj or special terms and if uni

are frequently employed ambiguously and with con

 as all words except proper names are 
general termsy and as generality is unity and re

all the original roots of language must he cate 
gorical and as every category or universal term 
includes the general and the general the indi

been taken primarily from general names and

terms gradually narrowing their significations to 
particulars and individuals and of even changing 
their category and of qualities and attributes be 
coming names of substantives and things — so that 
signs and the whole of language or signification is 
in perpetual mutation for want of regard to which 
men run innocently into ambiguities equivocations 
and misunderstandings — and logicians into errors 
in their demonstrations and of this mutation 
every word is one way or another an instance in

ledge would staate for want of signs or they 
would multiply beyond memory and management 
as it is the logician must content himself to make 
sure the signification and ground of discourse and 
guard against equivocation and sophistry 

 of aristotles predicables the universal 
comprehends genus species and individual as 
mere relations of classes variable according to 
reference and attributable to all things thus 
man is a universal or genus of which shakespere 
is a species or individual man is also an indi 
vidual or species of which animal is the genus or 
universal and so on to the first category or 
universal substance it is the same with other 
terms according to their category and these dis 
tinctions are mere attributes of number as one 
many or all — as unity plurality or totality i e 
as individuality generality or universality ac 
cording to category genus or species equally 
belonging to words propositions and arguments 
and are universally logical 

 inadvertence to these powers of words is a 
frequent occasion of ambiguity and false argument 
since that may be true of the individual which is 
false of the many or true of the many which is 
false of the whole and vice versa it has also 
occasioned terms significant or indicative of gene

application in the language and reasoning of

 thus there is a categorical unity per 
vading all language which has escaped notice 
although it is the hasis of all signification in 
general terms and afibrds an etymological unity 
in which every inquiry after roots will infallibly 
terminate if it be logically and philosophically 
conducted — words thoughts and things being of 
one original and the same analogy 

 accordingly it is logically and metaphysi 
cally evident that attribution and affirmation ex 
press only existence or modes of existence and to 
do this being the office of the verb verbs and their 
inflexions must be traceable to primary and so 
condai categories or being and modes of being 

 philologists have confirmed this dr vin

verbs in the greek and other languages were

verb signifying to do or to existj whence tense

terms are categorical serving at once as a guide 
to the etymologist and an aid to the logician 

 numberless illustrations of this maxim 
may be traced in our own language the most dif 
ficult as well as most important of which ar the 
prefixes and terminations by which words are in 
flected thus the terminations c ish ist ism ive 
izcj iscy esty es c express being from the same 
category as is from the verb to be so again en 
ent luj ingj ion on em im an ance ain 
ness express entiti or being as broken being 
broke wooden being wood goodness goodenis 
and others of like universal relation 

 to the prefix or sign of the infinitive of 
the english verb by which nouns or mere names 
are converted into verbs is also categorical and 
denotes being in action and is only a variation of 
the auxiliary verb to do being itself also an 
auxiliary thus love or do love is only the pro 
noun added to the infinitive rendered declinable as 
thou lovest or dost love c tooke has ascribed 
to and do to the same etymon 

 the universal substantive pronoun thing 
appears to originate in like manner from thhng 
theing or being and the termination ing which 
distinguishes the active participle seems also to be 
an abbreviation of thing expressing being exist 
ence or action thus writing is writething or

cations of which most words have or are suscep 
tible of a great variety which are to be learned 
from their context in writing or discourse which 
again is too various to be defined hence their 
significations change with every new relation or 
association even a motion or gesture to the eye 
accompanying a word or a tone to the ear effect 
this change and there are no more absolute signi 
fications of words than there are of ideas and words 
are subject to all the mutations and distinctions of 
thoughts and things and endless variations of 
context it is hence that grammarians are some 
times perplexed in deciding to which of their parts 
of speech a word belongs 

 words too like letters are sounds signi 
ficanti and have therefore a double appropriation 
to the ear and to the understanding and the most 
significant sounds afford the best or most expres 
sive words further as we speak to the ear so 
we write to the eye in which way capitals and 
italics which should never be employed either 
initially or in composition otherwise than empha 
tically add signification to words as accent and 
emphasis do through sounds — e g excuse 
excuse — attribute attribute c and in the 
first case words alike in sound but different in 
signification and formation or spelling are the same 
to the ear but differ to the eye and understanding 
the first belonging to the orthoepy of words the 
latter to their orthography

 philology or 

 with regard to the ear harmony of com 
position belongs as well to the euphony and 
accordance of words as it does to elementary 
sounds or letters in the first instance but with 
respect to words the most important consideration 
of all is their relation to understanding the chief 
end of language being the clear conveyance of 
thought and in this respect the analogy of struc 
ture and orthography are of chief importance 

 it may be held as a rule therefore in the 
employment of words that nothing ought to be an 
offence against grammar which is not at the same 
time an offence against reason and just significa 
tion or good sense nor can any practice in this 
respect be good which however tolerated by 
custom or idiom violates this rule and as clear 
conceptions depend upon accurate relations so 
perspicuous signification depends upon the like 
relations of signs 

 the virtue of language therefore lies 
above all things in a correct analogy of its struc 
ture and members and accordingly the most 
perfect and fertile languages are distinguished in 
this respect — such as is the greek and such 
also so far at least as respects the structure is 
our own vigorous and simple dialect which as

simplest rm of nature as its own

at the same end in a language the natural prin 
ciples and probable similarity of origin of which 
so much resemble theirs and which is fraught with 
the same free and philosophic spirit 

 it is the plastic power of the greek 
language derived from analogyy and the flexibility 
of its terms and significations that render it 
capable of modulation to all relations which is 
the property most essential to science and that 
which qualifies a language for the nomenclature

other dialects 

 there are indeed very few words which 
are not analogous probably none except those 
few which have come into general use but have 
been wholly confined to some philosophical or tech 
nical application our notions are indeed more 
numerous than our words each of these must 
therefore represent many of the former hence we 
must use words approximating in signification to the 
new ideas which we desire to express in judging 
of this approximation not only the illiterate but 
philosophers have often erred yet the words

be retained while they render a particular eflfort of 
the mind necessary to guard itself against adopting 
the false principles on which the use of them was 
originally founded the metaphysical terms per 
ceptiorit form idea c afford instances of the 
error here pointed out 

 the same words are often both equivocal and 
analogous for instance foot the part on which 
we stand that which supports anything the 
lower part a measure of length a certain number 
of syllables in a verse 

 probably all these significations of the word 
fiot are derived from analogy but when the 
analogy is not obvious the several senses are often 
considered independent of each other and the 
word is classed as equivocal thus it may be 
doubted whether the signification of xotrfjifog and 
mundtis and worlct were attached to those words 
by a merely accidental coincidence or whether they 
originated in any supposed analogy 

 analogy merits therefore the first atten 
tion of the grammarian and improvers of language 
both in respect to signs and signification and is 
in the employment of terms of much greater 
import than either custom or etymology which

confusion of names confound hoth knowledge and

of which acquires a distinct nomenclature into 
which every reformer imposes some new confusion 
so that when physics as they may become re 
duced to the unity of knowledge it will be found 
that physicians both medical and natural have 
built for themselves a tower of babel frustrated 
by a confusion of tongues meanwhile the unlearned 
will have been deinstructed and what knowledge 
they possess converted into ignorance by new scien 
tific names substituted for such as are vernacular 
and sufficient to simple knowledge the attempts 
are therefore excessive and mostly abortive that 
aim at delivering the improvements and discoveries 
of the sciences in new language beyond the neces 
sity of giving to what is absolutely new distinct 
appellations and symbols and for such we know 
no better rule adapted to our compound allabsorb

name most expressive of the thing signified and of

antiquarian and curious and useful only when 
logically true but anagrammatism and transposi 
tion so commonly resorted to by philologists both 
in words and sentences are the bane of etymology 
and criticism by licensing fanciful and false signi 
fications 

 thus there is a logical as well as a philo 
logical and a philosophical as well as a critical 
etymology connected with sound — an etymolog 
of signification as well as of sign by which natural 
derivation and relation are shewn that are of much 
more philosophical and logical importance than 
the etymology of words although neglected and 
for the most part despised by philologers the 
terms space and passion for example are of the 
same philosophical root if not of the same vocal 
origin thus passive signifies spacive or recep 
tive and such analogies are to be preferred when 
well founded to the doubtful however plausible 
etymologies of language which are valuable only

cording to which writers too strictly avoid the

of words or syntax which lays the foundation of

syntaxis 
section l 

 the third and last division of philology 
is syntaxis which is the science of systematising 
words or of the construction of sentences or propo 
sitions judgments periods and discourse simple 
or compound and it involves the art of verbal 
or literary composition in a particular and 
accepted sense syntax is the art of arranging 
words according to the established rules of a lan 
guage 

 the sentence or proposition is a com 
pound sign which implies or contains essentially 
at least one of each of the three primary orders or 
genera of words a substantive or subjective an 
attributive or predicate and a relative or con 
nective and these must agree in number person 
c logically every proposition is a judgment 
expressive of a relation

the analogy of propositions 

s but as some single or simple signs whe 
ther letters or syllables are words so some words 
are propositionsy and hold an intermediate station 
between simple terms or signs and perfect com 
pound significations or sentences and such are 
many of the inflections of verbs 

ri propositions are regarded technically in 
logic as having only two terms or extremes the 
subject and the predicate but the copula or 
verb which connects or identifies them and makes 
of them a logical judgment is a middle term there 
fore every proposition has necessarily three terms 

 such is the simple logical and gramma 
tical judgment proposition or sentence and if a 
second judgment be added as a reason or confirma 
tion to the first the sentence becomes a compound 
judgment and logical argument or enthymeme 
requiring only a third connecting term to become a 
syllogism such reason of a previous proposition 
we call its cave which we require by asking why f 
and connect them by the term because and we 
have shewn cause to be concuirence of things 
necessarily related or analogously 

 the rules of construction for the simple 
proposition are those also of the period or com 
pound proposition and of all discourse which con 
sists of propositions connected in series 

 many attributes may be connected with 
a subject or subjects or many subjects may be 
connected with an attribute or attributes and these

also afford compound sentences or periods and 
parenthetical propositions and sentences may be 
attributed and connected parenthetically in the 
manner of words 

 rhetorically the parenthesis has been 
objected to but every compound proposition is 
parenthetical nor can any sufficient discourse be 
conducted without some putting in and the 
periods which comprehend no parenthesis must 
necessarily be short and meagre enunciations 
tiring to the eye and teasing to the mind although 
admired by many for their terseness 

 this fashion of modern composition is 
opposed to the excessive employment and involu 
tion of long parentheses by old writers who often 
introduced several of them together or what is 
worse one within another embarrassing the sense 
and sometimes springing om and always pro 
ducing obscurity and confusion 

 the ellipsis is the opposite of the paren 
thesis and there is a third form of construction of 
periods in which the members are opposed or con 
trasted antagonistically in sense or sound and this 
is the antithesis and they may each become either 
a grace or a deformity a good or an evil in 
discourse for it is upon the addition substraction 
and division of words rightly calculated or upon 
the proper putting in and leaving out that the 
truth beauty and excellence of all composition 
and the fulness or faintness of the sense depend

but we digress and the digression and episode 
are to a poem or an entire discourse what a paren 
thesis is to a period or compound sentence 

s if therefore simple enunciations and ellip 
tical sentences in a continued discourse are short 
breathed and feeble the too complex and paren 
thetical are laboured and longwinded and both 
these and the antithetical in their extreme use are 
unnatural and affected there lies however be 
tween them a medial construction neither long nor 
short of a healthy manly breathing at once easy 
forcible harmonious duly opposed and effective 
and it is upon employment of such sentences and 
periods according to just signification and logical 
conjunction that propriety of construction good 
taste in composition and effective argument and 
discourse depend 

 to return to our position the logical 
relation before noticed as belonging to words 
and simple signs prevails also in sentences as 
judgments thus they are particular general or 
universal they are also as before shewn simple 
enunciations as for example the dog barks 
 the bird sings the mathematician calculates 
c or they are compound propositions periods 
or arguments or they are compound arguments 
or continued discourse but each of these the 
grammarian acknowledges by the name of sentences 
as the enthymeme and sorites are acknowledged to 
be syllogisms by the logician

only logical or relative to the understanding and 
connect this branch of knowledge with the science 
of logic of which propositions and judgments

 logically every proposition is a synthesis 
of a subject and predicate or an antithesis con 
nected by a copula and may by analysis be re 
solved into an hypothesis which expresses the 
condition of agreement or disagreement between the 
predicate and subject and a thesis or position 
which contains that which so agrees wherefore 
when the condition of the subject is expressed the 
proposition is hypothetical but when the predicate 
is given imconditionally the proposition is cate 
gorical or absolute therefore by expressing or 
suppressing the condition the hypothetical and 
categorical affirmative and negative propositions 
are convertible and this because every conceivable 
proposition is a correlation or analogous

every proposition is a position or thesis having 
its composition or synthesis its opposition or

on have been founded innumerable distinctions of

 of the three varieties of propositions the 
enunciative asserts something the interrogative 
raises a question or inquires and the imperative 
demands or commands and they are produced by 
the conversion of the terms of a proposition thus 
we make the predicate emphatical in an assertion 
— in a question we make the copula emphatical — 
but in a command or demand we make the subject 
emphatical thus john is good asserts is john 
good interrogates be good john commands 
the three terms admit only of three positions but the 
signification of each may be varied by a like trans 
position of the emphasis in each in the first 
position the verb is in the indicative mood in the 
second optative and in the last imperative — of 
which three all the other moods of grammarians 
are varieties 

 of propositions the indicative or enun 
ciative is principal in logic and its prime function 
is to define definition is accordingly the funda 
mental operation of logic and its office is to supply 
reason with correct premises for the compound 
operations of logical discourse or in other words 
to supply argument with true and perspicuous

 good logic requires that we should dis 
pense as much as possible with superfluous instru 
ments symbols and distinctions because these 
remove the mind by interposition from its matter 
which is thought the science of which is logic 
words and terms are the necessary symbols of 
thought and all that is necessary for correct logic 
is to insure that they be not employed equivocally 
but when the logician substitutes symbols for 
words into which they must be translated for 
thoughts he interposes ambiguities which weaken 
his logisms they are therefore admissible only 
when they illustrate or perspiciate an argument or 
thought which they rarely do and although the 
practice of the great logicians sanctions their use 
we all know that ristotle mystified esoterically 
and that in fine these multiplied logical imper 
tinences sunk the science and art into a play of 
symbols or figured feats of rattling swords and 
bucklers from which reason was dismissed alto 
gether logic is not therefore to be raised again 
by the confusion that overwhelmed it but must 
dismiss the medley of distinctions of terms defini

s such mechanically uniform construction is 
no more necessary however than that we should

of the false taste of continuous duplemembered

understanding can readily comprehend nor any 
paragraph longer than the voice can gracefully 
deliver and the memory and attention easily sustain 
in connexion with that which preceded it and in 
reference to that which is to follow nevertheless

avoiding extremes that as three words or terms are 
essential to constitute a complete proposition so a 
period of three propositions and a paragraph of 
three periods are sufficient to harmonious expres

although an unbroken page is symmetrical to the

 words thoughts and things are alone

in this respect and is thus also of universal re

logic and its logical foundation — not to teach 
the art admirably unfolded by aristotle with a 
grasp of intellect anticipating all subsequent at

 the simplest rhetorical effects are those 
of letters or alliteration principally with regard 
to sound and there are three kinds of alliteration 
one rhymicaly and in part rhythmical arising from 
the repetition of the same letter or sound an 
other which springs from the melody of different 
letters or sounds succeeding appositely and a 
third which arises from the harmony and contrast 
of different and even of discordant sounds all of 
which are employed for the purposes of expression 
and persuasion 

 most languages afford examples and our 
own abundantly of words expressively significant 
through natural sounds such are oi hiss 
whisper roar rough smooth harsh hard

 rhetoric refers to letters words and lan

sense comprehends grammar poetry and oratory 
and it may he called painting with words and like 
painting with the pencil is distrihutahle into dis 
position or grammatical composition — elocution 
or poetical colouring the opejum color es of 
horace — and delivery or oratorical expression 
a fourth division common to all arts and dis 
ciplines and belonging equally to painting and 
rhetoric is invention 

rf again of this distribution of rhetoric dis 
position or composition divides into an exordium 
or introduction — a narration or argument — and 
a peroration or conclusion a beginning a middle 
and an end which have similar subdivisions the 
first particularises and defines the second gene 
ralises and argues and the third universalises or 
includes in logical relation 

 so elocution comprehends contrast and 
harmony in the words and colouring correctness 
of composition and embellishment of tropes and 
figures and finally delivery with expression con 
sists in emphasis or strength character or manner 
and pathos or passion for the efiect of fine com 
position depends upon delivery and that is written 
well in vain that is not well read each and

the analogy of poetry 

 the middle station of rhetoric in the 
logical trivium adapts it to sensual relations 
whence oratory is sesisoned analogously with the 
elements of gustatory sense sweet acid and 
bitter — sweet in soothing praise or panegyry — 
sour in pungent sarcasm and keen satire — bitter 
in denunciation and these also in endless com 
mixture and variously affected by men 

 to illustrate not to prove and to excite 
the mind by true feelings and sentiments is upon 
the whole the proper office of rhetoric to de 
monstrate and convict belong to logic but since 
these powers of speech are often engaged with 
great force in misleading the mind and rhetoric 
is the common resort when reason fails verbal 
eloquence is ever to be entertained with a sus 
picion proportioned to its floridness its most 
legitimate office is to animate the fictions of the 
poet

 to verbal quantity or cadence belong 
the rhythmus of verse and this is determined by 
accentj emphasis and measure 

 rhyme marks the verse and distich or 
double verse a stop generally marks the he 
mistic or half verse which again is bisected by 
accent which marks the feet and distinguishes the 
time — the arsis or rise from the thesis or fall of 
which they are constituted 

 the fact that accent and emphasis are 
even more essential to logical signification than to 
sound has been overlooked by writers on prosody 
and orthoepy who attach them to the harmony of 
language in measure and period only 

 as to the melody of bhymesi whether 
single double or triple they are unisons merely 
whence the multitude of poets and the easy pow 
of rhyming to even a common ear indicates how 
few the number of radical sounds must be which 
constitute a language and it would probably be 
found upon thorough investigation that the num 
ber of rhymes of welldistinguished sounds therein 
hardly exceeds the letters of its alphabet 

 accordingly the first book of the iliad 
as translated by pope the most eminent of english 
rhymists consisting of verses contains only 
about thirty rhanes of distinctly difiering sounds 
founded upon the following monosyllables singular 
plural or inflected in three classes as made vocal

 style or diction involves both rhetoric 
and poetry being the power and manner of com 
municating or conveying thoughts through words 
and has like the whole of philological science a 
double reference or two extremes the one of 
which refers to signification or meaning only the 
other which refers to sounds the one designed 
to instruct the other to delight the one perspi 
cuous the other florid the first philosophical 
the latter poetical this sensible that intellectual 
in fine the one belonging to thoughts logically the 
other to words philologically the ultimate extreme 
of the one being poetical and rhetorical and that of 
the other prosaic or literal 

 accordingly words on the one extreme 
are either expressive to the mind or harmonious to 
the ear and in their use one or other of these must 
predominate while style as it regards thought 
on the other extreme is either historical or me 
morativet to record poetical rhetorical or imor 
ginativcy to delight or dialectical or ratiocinative 
to convince the extremes of which again coalesce 
and may be distinguished conjointly as didactic

 these modes of diction or style which 
are simple and generic are however rarely called 
into strict and uncompounded practice but mix 
according to the nature and relations of the sub 
ject and the endless variety which characterise 
and individualise the styles of different writers 

 thus on the loftiest of all subjects the 
religious or theological style is compounded va 
riously of the dialectical or philosophic the poetic 
or rhetorical and the historic styles in which 
nevertheless the first of these should predominate 
and characterise its delivery for the majesty of 
the subject is intellectually incompatible with the 
decoration of language and becomes most sublime 
and impressive when delivered with simplicity un 
adorned yet in levelling this subject to the in 
firmity of the human faculties so as to penetrate 
the soul with truth through the heart or to warm 
the heart through the mind it may be sometimes 
necessary to resort to all the persuasions and charms 
of verbal eloquence the like composition regula 
tion and latitude of style belong also variously to 
inferior subjects 

 from these principles it follows that the 
style of literary and oral composition should be 
adapted to the design either to instruct logically 
or delight sensibly if to delight or amuse only 
then must there be a sacrifice of signification to 
sound and poetic beauty if only to instruct then 
must all other things be sacrificed to logical per

and will again fall under our notice this style 
has also principally occupied the philologists and 
has been amply unfolded in many celebrated works 
of the rhetoricians while it has almost entirely 
usurped the ground of this science to the exclu 
sion of its correlative branches so that it is to be 
feared the poetic and rhetorical style has had too 
much influence in philosophy and that ere we can 
make any considerable advances therein it will be 
necessary that our taste should be amended with 
regard to the style in which it is too commonly 
delivered 

 the poetic style has been distributed 
by the most eminent rhetoricians triply into the 
sublimey the moderate and the plain or the 
lofty the level and the lowj and virgil has 
been cited as affording examples of each distinc 
tion of the first in his jeneid of the second 
in his georgics and of the third in his bu 
colics 

 poetry in its practice gives flexibility to 
language and facilitates the employment of words 
it is therefore an excellent discipline more espe 
cially in blank verse both epic and lyric without 
having had some exercise therein in rhyme mea 
sure and the choice of words few prose writers 
will excel in harmony of composition while the 
prose of the poet will be more apt to fail in the 
matter or thought than in the manner or language

any employment of figurative language or ornament 
is illegitimate in the diction when the matter to 
be conveyed is purely scientific or philosophical 
and that vice in the philosophic style is ever 
on the side of ostentation and tumidity nay it 
is even here as in things material and artificial

and diffidence we have sufficient reason for the 
guard of correct logic against a confident eloquence 
of any kind and as much so in literature as in 
oratory 

 to the sensual variety of style belong 
those of slang and levity adapted to banter and 
ridicule which however seasoned with humour 
and quaint wit are to be regarded as sophis 
tical degeneracies at variance with good taste and 
intelligence and a judicious writer will equally 
avoid the degrading of his subject by a low style 
as he will shun the ridiculousness of a false ele 
vation words like the current coin are repre 
sentative of value to the wise to the ignorant 
they are value itself whence the power of both 
over vulgar and mercenary minds

the best general literary style is that which without 
becoming either colloquial or quaint taking a leve

chapter 

sect l 

introduction 

 noology or the science of mind— 
the subject of logic — is coequal with the uni 
verse which is the object of all knowledge or 
philosophy following which we have traced the 
outline of philology or the science of repre 
sentation and perception in our preceding part 
whence we proceed from the science of words to 
that of thoughts and to develope the outline of 
logic whereon all conviction of knowledge depends 
for these three we have shewn to he coessential 
and that neither can greatly advance much less 
attain perfection independently of the other two 

ssl in a former universal outline we have 
regarded the system of knowledge or philosophy 

 melaphysically called psychology

 noology or 

according to the natural habit of mankind as 
external or objective in the present outline we 
regard the same system as subjective or in re 
ference to the mind as internal in which view 
we comprehend therefore the science of the human 
mind in its universal relations or noology as the 
proper basis of logic 

 but as in this change of position from the 
objective to the subjective the relations of science 
remain the same under a variation of view only 
it is merely expedient that we here advert briefly 
to the first genera of science unfolded in our 
stnopsisyf for the sake of connexion and dwell 
more particularly on that branch which peculiarly 
refers to the mind its faculties and discipline 
namely the logical department of knowledge in its 
common acceptation 

 the mind with reference to knowledge 
is a power of conforming itself to thingsy i e to 
another power out of or external to the mind and 
they are correlative powers which concur in sen 
sation and knowledge as effects and facts and 
as these are attended by selfconsciousness of the 
mindj and identify things with thoughts we must 
by universal analogy conclude that the external 
power is a universal self consciousness to which 
all mental and spiritual relation all knowledge

being and sensation belong — which is the subject 
of all objects and the object of every subject 
for without this there could be no communion 
between them 

 but this is ontological ground of uni 
versal noological reference and upon this analogy 
all physical and logical no less than all moral 
relations depend — all being and truth no less 
than all good 

 the reflex act by which the mind looks 
inward on itself is later attained and more difficult 
than the direct act by which it regards outward 
things and hence the interpretation of its faculties 
and their relations is not only difficult of acquire 
ment but also difficult of significant conveyance 
for herein the subject being also regarded as the 
objecty the view becomes indistinct and demands 
intent observation reflection and clear represent 
ation had we however a true and entire ex 
ternal objective system wherewith the internal 
subject cannot but conform these difficulties might 
be overcome and it is upon such an analogical 
view of the plan of knowledge universally that we 
essay to establish our logical outline 

 the primary genera of science we have 
shewn in our synopsis of philosophy are on 
tology or the science of being mesology or the 
science of knowing and teleohgyy or the science 
of doing and these consequently embrace all

 noology or 

other denominations of science but as all science 
is such only inasmuch as it refers to mind or in 
tellect of which to be to know and to do are the 
sole comprehending attributes and as being with 
out consciousness knowledge without under 
standing and doing without volition or will 
have no meaning so consciousness understanding 
and volition constitute mind universally con 
sciousness being pure intellect volition the evolu 
tion of active intellect and understanding the in 
volution of passive intellect the two latter con 
curring in consciousness which is pure active 
and passive — intellectual cause 

 it may be added in conformity with our 
analysis that there belong three chief modes to 
each of the three primary faculties of the mind or 
subject to consciousness belong existence sense 
and conscience to understanding memory ima 
gination and reason and to volition or will 
belong motions or appetites emotions or passions 
and motives or inclinations and that in a lo 
gical or subjective view mind is universal ge 
neral and individval and that these severally 
refer to science art and nature throughout all 
their relations 

 in short so typically identical do we re 
gard the subjective and objective universe that 
without anomaly both may be displayed upon the 
same ground in correlation thus —

 if now we are asked what is con 
sciousness we reply it is not so properly a 
faculty of the mind as it is mind itself — tliefounda 
hon of all faculties — common to all neither a mere 
genus nor a species but universal for the same 
reason we reply it is neither understandings which 
is reflective of consciousness nor volition which is 
conscious activity but it is the essential ground of 
both these and of all the subordinate faculties of 
the mind 

 neither therefore is consciousness eithef 
sense memory imagination or reason as dis 
tinct but it includes them all in fine therefore 
it is nothing different from itself but the founda

prior to the first or ulterior to the last involves a 
contradiction — an absurdity 

 consciousness is therefore the power to 
know or selfknowledge the logos in man taking 
the various forms of intellect or mind physically 
it is conception ethically it is conscience and 
logically it is conviction in conviction we are 
intimately conscious and logic is the science of 
conviction and its purpose is to convince and to 
convey the convictions of one consciousness to 
another ie to unite consciousnesses or make of 
one mind consciousness is therefore the pre 
siding faculty of mind or universally mind itself 
personality — the faculty to which all other faculties 
refer — the faculty of truth 

 if self says a contemporary of locke 
be both the subject and the object of con

of all perceptions and indeed there is no 
imagining any knowledge or sense and percep

is as far as we know and as himself declares the

active and passive powers — equally independent 
although efficient in conjunction — reciprocally con

 the will is also an active faculty be 
tween and correlative with the sensitive faculty 
and understandings both of which are passive in 
respect to will hence its moral effects in con 
currence with sense are determined by passion 
but with understanding they are determined by 
reason as its logical effects with sense are 
perceptions and with understanding are judg 
ments thus although the faculties of will and 
understanding are relatively to each other active 
and passive they are also in selfrelation both 
active and passive the first as determining the 
latter as determined 

 hence the wilu or active intellect has 
been properly defined the causality of the mind 
in which view it has however been the subject of 
continual controversy concerning the moral respon 
sibility of man terminable only through analogy 
whereby we have shewn cause to consist in con 
currence of action and passion and that the will

subjected or determined in the latter as passive 
whence at once the liberty and necessity of the

the analogy of logic ll 

 tbe controversy which arose from re 
garding the will as simple cause has been one 
of the most lasting and momentous with which 
literature has been burthened and afflicted and 
there is not a more important distinction both 
moral and metaphysical than this our analysis 
of cause and the evident consequence therefrom 
that man has two wilu the one active the 
other passive by the first of which he is morally 

jree or spontaneous and by the latter necessi 
tated or impelled while in physics and meta 
physics every catise being active and passive 
and these concvrrent in every effect naturally 
sets at rest the sceptical question of the non 
connexion of cause and effect 

 this analysis of caubse is not less im 
portant in regard to the will in logic wherein 
active will is efficient in research and argu 
ment as passive will is in reception and con 
viction yet it is necessary to regard them as one 
faculty it being as we have shewn impossible 
to separate entirely the concurrent powers of action 
and passion because they are infinitely correlative 
so that each of the mental faculties is active and 
passive whence it is necessary for the logician 
as well as the moralist to preserve the freedom 
or activity not only of his will but of all his 
faculties there is nevertheless some difficulty 
to the unpractised mind in adapting conception

and expression to the varying relations of these 
powers and faculties 

 the will or practical intellect has been 
regarded as merely ethical or moral but this 
though principal is by no means the whole to 
which the faculty of will extends since it involves 
the whole science of ends and the entire sphere 
of art or doing whether by physical motion in 
mechanic art through sensible emotion in fine 
art or through moral motive which is purely 
ethical as understanding chiefly with regard to 
reason is logical 

q it is the end that governs the will and 
for the sake of which it acts but of ends the 
will can have no notice but by the use of the 
other faculties which are passive or necessarily 
determined whether they be of sense or of rear 
son the office and active freedom of will consists 
therefore in electing and determining between 
them the will is thus a supreme power ruling 
according to law or as arbitrary it is the agent 
of all art 

 although volition or will is thus prin 
cipally a moral faculty associated with conscience 
or moral consciousness it is also of great logical 
consideration from the false power it is allowed to 
exercise in determining the judgment and under 
standing whose office it should be to instruct the 
will the faculty of will is therefore of great

negative importance to the logician to regulate 
and control since it is commonly determined by 
the passions and appetites which he should en 
tirely subject to the understanding for the freedom 
of reason 

 but the natural will and understanding 
though inseparable are opposed in power and 
office understanding being the ally and servant 
of intellect but will is allied to and often the 
slave of sense whence men are morally good or 
bad according to the ruling or predominance of 
their reason or their wills 

 the will by analysis exhibits three 
powers — a power of decision and determination 
especially called willing — a power of rejection 
or denial and forbearance properly called niluing 
— and between these a reflex power of suspen 
sion indecision or indetermination which may 
analogously be named shifting or shiluingy which 
is idiomatically expressed by the phrase shilli 
shalli and the interrogative shall i thus 
election rejection and szpension are various 
modes of volition comprehending the whole power 
and freedom of this faculty of which to will and 
to niu are present and to shall or skill is future 
as tenses of the same verb determining the gram 
matical distinction of the term shall and will 
which in practice are often confounded 

 it is by the latter power of suspension 
and indecision i e by deliberation that the will

connects itself or concurs with understanding and 
inquiry and as the office of language consists 
in affirming and denying interrogating and com 
manding there is a philological and logical unity 
of words and thoughts as of thoughts and 
things 

 it is this power that locke in reference 
to the understanding calls rejection and makes 
it the second source of knowledge the first being 
sensation the source of natural as the former 
is of arbitrary or artificial knowledge whence 
reflection is to thought what experience and 
experiment are to sense — the first being the ex 
ertion of active as the latter is of passive con 
sciousness and incapable of total separation from 
each other thus reflection is the experiment 
of the mind or internal experience as opposed 
to external and physical experience and experi 
ment 

 hence the will is of much more efficiency 
in logic than is generally imagined whence it has 
been commonly disregarded by the logician and 
consigned to the moralist in whose science it is 
the principal faculty and we have so regarded it 
in connexion with consciousness or conscience 
yet the will is the prime power in the logic of

 the whole logic of bias is accordingly 
more dependent on this usurping and enslaving 
faculty of will than on the defects of understand

enters into any question and to allow it only a 
negative voice in entire subjection to the under

forms than the argumentum baculinum and in 
duction of physical forces to which rulers and

of merit it often overrules and frustrates the 
objects of great talents it is evident neverthe 
less that it is a true logical faculty inasmuch as 
it has the entire and nottobeneglected order of 
imperative propositions subject to it the legiti

not to call in question but to assign it a distinct

the logic of deliberation and inquiry of great

 hence it is highly expedient to restore 
this disregarded faculty to its true station in the 
noological system made manifest by analogy and 
the master faculty of consciousness which assures 
us of the wiu and understanding — our active

counsel and choose in all of which this faculty 
is of the highest practical importance and espe

 thus again in neology or subjective 
philosophy as in the objective there is an essen 
tial triplicity of parts and a system of correlation 
throughout so that not only whatever exists but 
also whatever can be thought or known is relative 
and there is nothing absolute throughout the whole 
system of science hence true philosophy though 
ever the same in plan presents a different aspect as 
the view changes under which a new order and 
new denominations of its relations arise so that 
in all such changes we do violence as it were to 
the original hence some dissidences in the details 
of universal philosophy — hence also the difficulty 
of attaining a perfect system and the unavoidable 
confusion among arbitrary sciences and systems 
for all of which there is no other remedy than a 
perfect representative system or in other words 
a system of philology or language perfectly analo

subjective and objective their advancement must 
therefore be reciprocal

will be adequate means for conveying with ease and 
accuracy as well as for conceiving truly the entire

 so fertile in other respects is the subject 
of the human will that volumes out of number 
have done little toward exhausting it our present 
purpose is simply logical and we have already 
treated of the logical will shewing that the defi

reason is too limited for a science of universal 
compass that includes every faculty and instrument 
of human cognition no less than the exercise of 
reason as an art

it has reason and to these belong relatively the 
three genera of logical science — mnemonics or 
history to memory poetics to imagination and 
dialectics to reason of which setting apart the 
two former we reserve the latter to which more 
particularly belongs the science of ratiocination the 
art and discipline of logic 

 notwithstanding we thus set apart the 
consideration of the sciences to which the several 
powers of the mind are related excepting only 
dialectics which belong principally to the power 
of understanding and its chief faculty reasouj it is 
evident according to universal relation that all 
these powers and faculties of the mind are vari 
ously coessential to all its acts and effects it is 
expedient therefore in a logical view that we 
extend our inquiry concerning them 

 ah knowledge is the eflpect of the con 
currence of that which knows or the subject with 
that which is known or the object and as man 
knows nothing more of objects than their effects 
or facts he having no power of transcending his 
system so he is incapable of knowing any more of 
his own subject than its effects 

 now as the elements of objective effects 
are powers or eflscients which are either active or 
passive the same also are the powers or faculties of 
the mind or subject which are memory imagina 
tion and reason from which spring the effects 
and energies of the subject and such are perception

conception and judgment and finally from effects 
and energies spring other effects or operations of the 
mind or suhject and such are the modes or forms of 
argument logic involves therefore subjectively 
the powers or faculties effects or energies and 
acts or operations of the mind or subject each 
active and passive of which in order 



section il 

 first of the logical faculties 
of the mind in analysing knowledge objectively 
we discover an external object matter — an internal 
object mind or intellect — and a medial object 
sense each of which may be resolved into action 
and passion and they are the ground of three 
primary corresponding sciences — the material or 
physical the sensible or sesthetical and the intel 
lectual or ethical sciences and with these the 
primary faculties and energies of the subject and 
the faculties and forms of logic must correspond 
or accord 

 hence the logical mind or subject in con 
currence with external or material objects receives 
and retains perceptions intuitions or sensations by 
its faculty of memory which is passive attention in 
receiving and active thought or apprehension in 
recollecting what has been received or thought 
thus memory is the receptacle of the particulars of

sense and reminiscence or recollection which are 
the matter of thought it is therefore a particular 
ising faculty the two extremes of which reception 
and recolleciion are connected hy association as a 
subordinate or intermediate faculty of memory 
connecting it with imagination 

 again by the concurrence of the logical 
subject with medial or sensible objects which con 
stitute the particulars with which memory is fur 
nished are formed images and conceptions by 
a generalising or comprehending faculty called 
imagination which is passive in receiving or con 
ceiving given images or ideas as of a man or a horse 
and active in reconceiving associating and com 
posing them as in the framing of the conception of 
a centaur c 

 finally by the concurrence of the logical 
subject with internal or intellectual objects are 
formed apprehensions judgments enunciations and 
conclusions through the conceptions associated by 
the imagination from the particulars retained by 
memory by universalising faculty called reason 
and as memory is active in recollecting its particu 
lars and the imagination in reconceiving and 
combining or generalising them so reason is active 
in comprehending judging and concluding according 
to universal relations and passive in receiving or 
comprehending with conviction hence reason 
properly defined is the faculty of the recognition of 
relations — the faculty which especially distinguishes

no cognition of relations or genera although they 
perceive the distinctions of things and infer as 
they are impressed 

 as reason is the highest and principal 
power or faculty of the logical mind and is of 
internal relation so reason is more particularly 
an active faculty and memory a passive faculty 
while imagination is medial — equally active and 
reactive 

 yet are these various attributes and dis 
tinctions of the mind not absolute but relative for 
in every act and acquisition of the mind each of its 
powers and faculties is engaged the original 
powers of will and consciousness being essential to 
understanding and of the subordinate powers of 
the latter memory to collect imagination to 
apprehend and reason to compare and judge are 
coessential conditions of every thought or energy 
of mind and distinct only through analysis 

s and with respect to their concurrent or 
conjoint active and passive functions which all 
these variously possess it is to be remarked that 
these principles concur inseparably for that which 
is passive acts or reacts and that which is active 
suffers from the patient whence not only the su

action and passion analogically to wellconceive

indissoluble coessentiality of principles and rela 
tions universally is the highest office of intellect 
and the most conducive to knowledge and science 

 thus there are three diffierent habits of 
thought to which it is important to direct the 
attention for the legitimate exercise of the logical 
faculties by one of which we exercise thought 
through associations by another through ima 
ginations and by a third we do this through 
relations 

 in the first memory is the ruling faculty 
and although it associates realities principally its 
associations are for the most part arbitrary and 
often absurd but in this way men retain and recall 
knowledges through repetition and associations 
and many ingenious arbitrary and unsound systems 
of knowledge have been raised and supported upon 
no better foundation than the associations of 
thought or ideas the natural ground of which is 
physical 

 in the second imagination is the pre 
vailing faculty which combines even more arbitrarily 
and indiscriminately not only realities but things 
the most fictitious heterogeneous and absurd and 
men of lively imaginations do not scruple to seek 
knowledge upon this ground and some of the most 
elegant and ingenious theories and systems have 
been raised upon no better foundations than fancy 
the basis of this mode of thinking is ssthetical and 
its legitimate office is poetical

 in the third mode of exercising thought 
reason is the governing faculty by which men seek 
and attain knowledge and science upon the ground 
of their true relations only according to the 
universality of nature no true system can have 
any other foundation and no other is truly logical 
or philosophical 

 we do not mean to assert that either the 
associations of memory or the constructions of 
imagination are to be totally discarded from the 
operations of the mind but that they are only to be 
used as aids in subordination to the government of 
reason and true relations in all things it is their 
predominance and the fallacious ruling of these 
faculties in the offices of thought that leads to 
erroneous doctrines and to consequent erroneous 
practice — the subject is enormous and fully to 
develope it would fill volumes 

 it is apparent that the associations of 
memory i and ihe figures of imagination are both 
best formed on the relations of reason and truth

exercise of memory and imagination is through 
nature and these relations and that the arbitrary 
use of both is to be avoided as habits and therefore

 as memory is the faculty of the mind 
first disclosed and perfected in youth so it is the 
first to decay in age to assist its powers of 
acquisition and retention — or as it were to take 
ideas into custody — many modes of artificial mem 
ory have been proposed for surcharging this faculty 
in youth and invigorating its repletion in age 
which have given rise to the questionable science of 
mnemonics to us there appear three natural 
modes in which memory may be assisted namely 
by reiteration association and order or arrange 
ment the first is most germane to memory the 
second draws on imagination and the third is most 
indebted to reason for neither of these faculties 
is independent of the others but they are as we 
have said inseparable and in every mode of arti

strengthened by two things being posited for the 
retention of one

or reiteration repeating or calling to mind every 
night whatever of moment had been done or learnt 
during the day that pythagoras taught his disciples 
to confirm the acquirements of this faculty and 
this it does in the reduplicate ratio of repetitions

 by association memory with imagination 
connects eher known ideas or the unknown or 
the known with the unknown by which latter 
some new idea is attached to some figure of ima

are effected is that universal analogy by which 
the world is filled with similitudes and linked in 
unity in an infinite variety of ways j they are 
otherwise arbitrary and partial methods only not at 
all philosophical nor logical 

 association of ideas is also a natural 
process by which imagination forms pictures or 
groups of ideas and assists memory by trains and 
combinations of words and thoughts through ana

dissociation or separation and distinction of ideas

association and dissociation are therefore equal 
processes of the logical mind — the synthesis and 
analysis of active imagination which necessarily 
precede or accompany memory 

 this association of ideas consists in the 
bringing of ideas into some sort of relation or suc 
cession and the more natural analogous and true 
such trains and relations are the easier isrmer and 
more valuable will be their association but should 
they be arbitrary trains or false relations they will 
require reiteration and their permanence will be 
proportioned to the frequency of repetitions which 
memory never refuses to this mode of mnemonics 
belong the triads ofbardism 

 such briefly is the philosophy of the as 
sociation of ideas or relations formed arbitrarily 
and without rule by imagination in aid of memory 
or better framed according to the invariable natural 
regulation of reason which is itself the faculty of 
the recognition of real relations founded in uni

professions to distrust inasmuch even as truth is 
not clear it is of little more value in science than 
ignorance is nor is it even so favourable as igno

 when we will admit undefinable and un 
conscious premises and assertions any madman 
may argue us into convictions of utter absurdity 
reason therefore rejects whatever is mystical or 
fantastic and it is only through indolence su 
pineness or passive will that the mind gives uncon

logical authority the highest oflbce of imagina

and poetical images of natiue and art and of re 
fining and freely combining them in the productions 
of wit and genius 

 the inventive power of imagination in 
forming ideas and images whether poetical or phi 
losophical is entirely due to the analogy of all 
natures whereby every thing correctly thought is 
related to all others 

there is instinct in mind a feeling of this ana 
logy which prompts us to transfer the relations of 
one thing to some other and when such are remote 
or unusual and connected felicitously and fitly it is

in happy conjunction therewith hence imagination 
is a faculty of constructing analogically and of con 
ceiving analogies and relations 

 in art and literature imagination is as 
useful in condensing and abridging as in aug 
menting ideas enabling us to put a part for the 
whole — 

 for much imaginary work was there — 
that for achilles image stood his spear 
graspd in an armdd hand himself behind

shakspeake — tarquin and lucretia 

 analogy is the source and substance of 
fvitf which is condensed sense or signification 
whether it be the wit of wisdom in the apophthegm 
of the philosopher or the degenerate wit and pun 
of the humourist which evokes a double meaning 
for the first discloses some deep or valuable corre 
lation and the latter supplies a double meaning or 
relation which when true excites admiration and 
warms reason and when false or absurd provokes 
mirth and laughter and between these lie all de 
grees of wit which belonging to imagination is 
rhetorical and not logical so much more indeed 
does wit depend on words than on thought that it 
can only be imperfectly translated from one language 
to another 

 hence also the antagonism of reason and 
admiration with mirth and laughter for though

rational animal man is the faculty of laughter 
given — the consciousness of absurdity being as es

 hence also the scope and object of 
reason and laughter are triply coincident for 
laughter is physical through titillation of the 
nerves and muscles it is sensible through sympathy 
from seeing others laugh or it is intellectual and 
logical from conviction of absurdity to subdis

sense and gives relish to all the appetites drawing 
also on all the faculties of mind it reacts by pre

is thence an object of especial caution to the 
logician 

 the power of imagination in pursuing 
the succession and subordination or series of nature 
and particulars and of storing memory appears to 
have no bound we cannot conceive anything so 
small or few but imagination can represent that 
which is smaller and fewer without end nor any

the judging faculty in generalizing the materials

 but imagination has not only the synthetic 
office of fancifulli and infinitely positing and com 
posing augmenting and diminishing it has also 
the analytic power of negating separating and dis 
tributing which is called abstraction which if it 
be a distinct faculty of the mind as some have 
supposed is a faculty between imagination and 
reason in which both are engaged for in truth 
the mind has no absolutely independent faculty 
we learn hence that abstract ideas represented by 
general terms are relations of imagination and not 
real things and that to the imagination or con 
ceiving faculty belong the operations both of ana 
lysis and synthesis 

 the elements of mind are analogous to 
those of matter active and passive reason as 
the solid earth is passive memory as the ocean of 
knowledge flowing and liquid and imaginatiouy as 
the elastic air and fire of intellect expanding and 
contracting is active j and man must employ each

dry like the earth is the solid basis of under

extended and the universe truly understood is a 
system of metaphoric analogy to the poet and of

 to conclude it is not sufficient that the

insufficiency and the admission of facts and figures 
unsupported that have justly subjected phrenology 
mesmerism and numberless doctrines at different

since they are already dead to reason and if they

are coessential to logical ratiocination and con

false relations and on imaginary ground 

 reason is thus the highest faculty of the 
understanding and nearest to pure consciousness 
but although it is therefore justly regarded by 
logicians as superior to its other faculties it does 
not follow that it is to be placed above its com

 in every act of the understanding all its 
faculties are engaged in triune indivisibility ren

their analysis only partly possible according to 
relation even in the most familiar offices of under

external sense of sight a building or other ibgure

picture never extending to more than half the 
surface and to none of the solid contents of such

 it is the same in the analysis of the 
judgments of reason as in the conceptions of 
imagination and the perceptions or receptions of 
memory and sense the distinctions of which are 
but the analogical relations of individual under 
standing and consciousness under various subor

cannot 

 attention falsely treated as an original

therefore distinguished the analogisnty and genera 
logism or induction 

 these three modes or forms of argument 
logism or ratiocination — the generalogicau or in 
ductive the syllogisticalj or scholastic and the 
analogical or universal comprehend all dialectical 
operations consonant in plan and relation to the 
faculties and energies before enumerated upon 
which they depend 

 but although there are thus various 
modes of ratiocination there is but one reason 
and hence that which is proved in one of these 
modes may often be argued and proved in the 
other there being however no perfect conclusion 
in any case without a universal subsumption by the 
premises it does not follow therefore that each 
of the modes is on every occasion equally proper or 
equally prompt in conducting to true conclusions j 
and herein lies the use of logic in directing us how 
and on what occasions to apply the several modes 
of argument and inquiry while by instructing us 
in the various forms and powers of ratiocination it 
enables us also to analyze and test the arguments 
of others 

 it is to be noted also that these dis 
tinctions of modes are by no means absolute 
neither of them being independent of the others 
hence they reciprocate and compound and it is 
to this reciprocation to express which language is

inadequate owing to the want of true analogy in 
the significations of words that we are to attribute 
the difficulty of conveying and in some measure 
of conceiving this systematic ubiquity in which no 
part is absolute but all is relative it is sufficient 
however for the present if the foregoing has 
evinced the conformity of logic with science in 
general 

 the three organs or modes of argument 
being convertible reciprocally every subject may be 
investigated and treated analogically syllogistically 
orgeneralogically accordingly the induction or 
generalogism may be exhibited as a chain of minor 
syllogisms and vice versd as the analogism may be 
also and both syllogism and generalogism may be 
shewn to be analogically constructed 

 it does not follow hence that the use of 
these organs is indifferent for all subjects for 
there is a natural affinity by which the induction 
or generalogism is best qualified for physical opera 
tion the syllogism for mathematical calculation 
and the accurate sensible sciences and the ana 
logism for moral and metaphysical investigation 
while a diversified use of the three according to 
experience taste and judgment is suited to a 
mixed inquiry 

 they err injuriously to science who refer 
all logical determination to either organ singly as 
the disciples of aristotle do who acknowledge the 
syllogism only and the followers of bacon locke

 there are three ways m which terms are 
logically united in the formation of judgments and 
arguments firstly by reciprocal relation and 
this constitutes the analogical judgment secondly 
by inclusion and this is the syllogistic judgment 
or proposition and thirdly identification and 
this is the generalogical or inductive judgment 
all of which denote relations — correlation con 
tinence and simulation 

 whatever we can know must be either 
experience of fact or sense inference of reason 
or analogy that is relation of consciousness in 
correspondence with which there can therefore be 
but three principal modes of iccal conviction 
first a oeneralogismt or induction of facts se 
condly a syllogism or subsumption of reason 
and thirdly an amdogism or consciousness of 
relation and this latter may have been the sense 
in which the epicureans held anticipation to be 
the principle of demonstration so that nothing is 
capable of demonstration of which the mind has 
not precognition or notice revivable by argument 

 in the common logic says bacon 
 the labour is principally bestowed upon syllogism 
while the logician scarce thinks of induction but 
touching it slightly passes on to the forms of dis 
putation whereas we reject the demonstration by 
syllogism as confused and letting nature slip 
through the fingers whilst we take induction for

that form of demonstration which guards the senses 
presses nature close and rules over works but 
the method of induction asserts the particular 
facts of nature experience and practice as the 
method of syllogism does oeneral media both of 
which escape the true logical foundation of unu 
versal reasons which belong to analogism 

 had not the logician a power of de 
scending analogically through consciousness from 
the universal correlations to particulars and indi 
viduals analytically he would want the power of 
ascending oeneralogicalhf or by induction from 
individual and particular relations to genera and 
universal relations synthetically in the first he 
descends from internal correlations to external 
phenomena and in the other he ascends from 
external and particular effects to internal and 
universal cause they are converse and extreme 
processes and are correlative and concurrent in 
the syllogism antithetically denoting universal 
cause as intellectual and individual effects as 
natural 

 thus there is a like reciprocation of the 
logical organs and operations that pervades the 
faculties and energies on which they depend 
giving to each the same regulation and intimate 
correlation that renders their independent consi 
deration difficult while it multiplies the variety of 
ways in which logic may be investigated and 
treated as syllogistical inductive or analogical —

chapter iv 

analogism 

section i 

introduction 

 the whole history of human intellect bears 
witness that whatever be the nature and subject of 
its speculations scepticism ever is the extreme to 
which philosophers and the learned fly from the 
opposite false extreme and course of dogmatical 
credulity 

t but scepticism is the resort of ineffectual 
endeavours as credulity is of supineness and if 
scepticism is as has been said the nerve of the 
strong mind credulity is the lassitude of the weak 
or indolent mind and they are as opposed to just 
logical conviction as they are to each other for such 
conviction leaves neither room for active scepticism 
nor passive credulity 

 it was indeed the discordances of these 
extremes that first forced philosophers in search of 
a logical mean of conviction — a criterion and 
canon of truth — an organ whereby to adjust and

 analogism 

harmonise their diflferences in the endeavour after 
which the speculative intellect of the greek logi 
cian carried him to the metaphysical and ideal ex 
treme as the practical mind of the briton carried 
him to the opposite extreme of the physical or 
material and real 

 although therefore a happy release 
through logic from the extreme consequences of 
dogmatism and scepticism has marked the pro 
gress of intelligence it yet appears that learning 
has rushed into extremes in logic analogous to 
those which obstructed the peace and progress of 
philosophy and that there is no other escape from 
the false extremes and failures of either than the 
disclosure of the true analogical mean of reconci 
liation in and between the extremes of both and if 
logic is to supply this mean to philosophy then it 
is first necessary that logic should establish the 
true connecting mean of its own extremes the one 
of which is syllogistic and the other inductive 

yy for although the science of logic is 
especially founded on intellect and gives law to 
understanding it has been adapted principally 
to mathematical and physical inquiries which be 
long to matter and sense by its two most eminent 
authorities who have been therein implicitly fol 
lowed by succeeding logicians so that in fact we 
have had only a logic of sense and signs and a 
logic of matter but a logic of pure intellect 
and universal relation has been hitherto wanting

analogism 

notwithstanding the acknowledged importance of 
such a logic and a loose recognition of the mode 
of analogy which leads to it by logicians who 
at the utmost have regarded analogy as an indi 
rect method of reasoning as they did induction 
also before the time of bacon 

 every instrument is for good or evil ac 
cording as it may be employed and analogy as 
an instrument is capable of both the ancient 
poets employed it indifferently in the construction 
of figures but when they mythologised with it by 
carrying the physical into the intellectual world as 
when they identified the sun and apollo through 
analogy of light and truth and formed of them a 
god visible and tangible to the sensual and igno 
rant multitude and intelligible only to the initiated 
few they employed analogy in behalf of falsehood 
for the sake of power and so far as an instrument 
of evil the abuse is however not that of the in 
strument but of the agent and the artifice for 
christ who was the truth and the light em 
ployed their perfect analogy logically and openly for 
perfect good 

 but there are analogies of nature which 
are facts and there are analogies of fancy which 
arejigtmres and there are analogies of reason which 
are truths or axioms and these latter relations are 
more especially logical though each species is 
variously subordinate to reason 

 the constant struggle of philosophers after

absolute principles or grounds of knowledge has 
run all their systems into paradox because man can 
have no knowledge but of relations hence 
from whatever point of inquiry the philosopher de 
part it may be resolved into a relation to which he 
must by the law of consciousness or order of his 
intellect assign correlates but these are not abso 
lute things since by investigation they will be found 
to be correlate relations also and if the analysis be 
continued to the end it terminates in an identical 
relation of which the one correlate is the i or 
conscious individtudy and the other the universal 
consciousness which is all in all thus the 
universe is a system of analogy beyond which 
philosophy cannot penetrate however we may di 
versify and complicate inquiry and to this we owe 
that the logical universe is the subjective form of 
the philosophical universe and that analogism is 
the universal organ 



analogism 

 that an organ so obvious as the analo 
gism should have iain dormant in logic is to be 
attributed to this dogmatical and absolute cast of 
thought to the devious paths of analogy the easy 
grasp and comparative facility of the other logical 
organs the apathy of mind to pure inward specu 
lation and promptness to outward sensuous opera

tion whereby analogy has been consigned to 
imagination employed in construction of symbols 
rhetorical and poetical allusion or common illus 
tration by example and excluded from strict ratio 
cination and science except partially in the mathe 
matics 

 this long exclusion of the analogum 
may also have been the same that rendered logic 
altogether the successor of other sciences man 
began to make partictuar and practical observa 
tions before general ones and the latter before 
he had thought of principles and the universal 
to which the force of analogism especially belongs 
and in the uncultivated state of his mind to 
analogise rhetorically through similitudes or par 
ticular parities was probably a later refinement 
of unlettered man the natural logical course being 
from dogmatical inductions through syllogisms of 
sense to universal analogism 

 the universe of things and of thoughts 
is a unity or universality coinclusively and this 
unity of things is universal nature to which phi 
losophy belongs as the unity of thoughts is uni 
versal reason to which logi belongs and these 
great primary unities are entirely correlative or 
anahgousj whence the mind is empowered to 
reason of things and as universal nature 
includes every thing every class and every order 
up to the highest so universal reason includes 
every genus species and individual under it

there could be neither induction of similars com

 as the things of nature and the 
thoughts of reason concur in signification

predicates whence whatever i true of any whole 
is true of all its partsf is valid also throughout 
every mmde of ratiocination and is derived or 
modified and variously expressed by logicians

this is the principle of logical assent and 
dissent equally but contrarily conclusive in affir 
mative and negative arguments whence also the 
logical principle of contradiction whereby it is 
impossible for the same thing at once to be and 
not to be 

 analogy is thus the foundation of the 
negative principle and axiom of contradiction or 
identity whereby a proposition cannot be at once 
both true and false and the same truth cannot at 
once be affirmed and denied of the same thing 
whence whatever is i and cannot not he and 
this principle is that of all logistic and mathe 
matical demonstration and gives authority also 
to the rule of contraries whereby what is truly 
affirmed of anything may be as truly denied or 
its contrary affirmed of its contrary

things and he who argues for truth seeks points

 thus all logical processes resolve into

equation — relation of analogy — or correlation 
whatever be the form or instrument employed and 
for such matter logic must appeal to philosophy

 accordingly every degree of evidence is 
a degree of analogy so that there is neither on 
bhity nor necessity nor any probability but of 
analogy and all dependent on that uniformity of

and on which it has relied in all its thoughts acts

coinclusively and this process and its organ is 
analogtsm and comprehends the other two 

 the premises of the oeneralogism or in 
duction are always less than the genus or category 
of the question and those of the syllogism are 
always limited by its predicament but the pre 
mises of the analogism are absolutely unbounded 
are greater than the universe and include its 
author its unity is infinity and its infinity in 
finite so that wherever it can find or imagine a 
paradigm or parity or maintain an equation it can 
attain a logical conclusion 

 it is this sublime quality of the analogism 
that has principally betrayed it in logic and con 
signed it to desultory rhetoric and poetry it is 
nevertheless the sole means of theological and 
divine argument in which the antient and modem 
mystics have also employed it so fallaciously and 
so contrarily to the sobriety of ordinary reason and 
judgment as also to have discredited it in logic 

 hence the principal danger from ana 
logism is the giving itself up to the license of ima 
gination instead of the government of reason on 
account of the infinity of its relations which con 
stitute the universe and although it exists under 
a perfect and divine subordination it requires the 
guidance of reason to conduct it free from error 

it is this misdirection of the analogism by 
imagination that has repudiated it in the ordinary 
logic

 these influences were in operation before 
the time of aristotle and led that eminent genius 
who enterprised in all knowledge to consign both 
analogism and induction to rhetoric and to admit 
the first as comparison or paradigm only in his 
logic building solely on the categorical ground of 
the syllogism with such wonderful acumen and 
completeness however that succeeding logicians 
have only ventured to abridge or vary but not to 
add to or depart from it with the partial exception 
of bacon who rescued induction from rhetoric 
and thus established the generalogism imperfectly 
in the more confined area of physics wherein 
nevertheless it has produced such prominent eflfects 
and inspirited such wonderful achievements for the 
world that sober lookerson stand aghast i — al 
though in a more elevated view it has accomplished

disciplines which obstructed all advancement in 
science and the progress of civilisation a reform

wisdom that knowledge might not stagnate nor

analogism 

 philosophy in the early ardency of intel 
lect had first preceded logic and overshot its 
basis checked then for a time by logic and now 
again pursuing its rapid way with insufficient 
guides it is approaching a position from which 
it will have to commence a new career by a new 
reform of logic 

 to qualify analogism for this it will be 
necessary to control the expansible power founded 
in the natural constitution of the mind whereby it 
is urged to extremes and led to seek beyond the 
legitimate boundary of knowledge the cause of 
causes the condition of conditions the element 
of elements and to lose itself in interminable in 
quiries and endless suppositions and oppositions 

 it is first incumbent therefore to deter 
mine the boundary of its authority which reason 
tells us must be that of knowledge whence the 
range of logic and philosophy is the same and all 
employment of analogism or the other modes be 
yond this is invalid now such boundary are the 
philosophical categories of relation and existence 
of which we have shewn the identity and hence 
it is plainly the first and universal principle of 
logic and philosophy that there can he no rea 
soning or logical inference where there is no es 
sential or existing relation material sensual or 
intellectual and that all such relations are ana 
logical or correlative

 analogism 

 there is hardly a page in any work of 
argument wherein analogy has not been employed 
in aid of reason yet have logicians strangely 
excluded the analogism as an accredited organ 
from logic —and a late eminent logician although 
freely employing analogical reasoning and illus 
trating the syllogism both grammatically and che 
mically does not acknowledge the analogism as an 
organ of logic in which use and neglect of analogy 
he does however but agree with his predecessors 
and existing schools 

 he remarks concerning analogy — st 
when two persons are said to have the same qua 
lity c what we predicate of them is evidently a 
certain resemblance and nothing else one man 
e g does not feel anothers sickness but they are 
said to have the same disease if they are precisely 
similar in respect to their ailments d such 
qualities as are entirely relative — which consists in 
the relation borne by the subject to certain other 
things — in these it is manifest the only resemblance 
that can exist is resemblance of relations i e 
analogy when it is said therefore of two 
courageous men that they have both the same 
quality the only meaning this expression can have 
is that they are so far completely analogous in 
their characters having similar ratios to similar 
objects in short as in all qualities sameness can 
mean only strict resemblance so in those which

analogism 

are of a relative nature resemblance can mean only 
analogs the whole of which amounts in sub 
stance to admitting that there are analogy oflden 
tity and analogy of relation and that these are 
the same differently or in degrees 

 thus analogy as it is commonly under 
stood and interpreted by logicians signifies only 
resemblance among objects although it is strictly 
significant of real relations as of kindred in 
father and son c — as of concurrence in agent 
and patient — and of all the afiinities and correla 
tions of nature and the universe and it is upon 
this direct immediate and necessary analogy that 
the indirect and remote analogies of similitude and 
parity depend hence the logic of analogy is in 
the latter respect only rhetorical illustrative and 
of little force or evidence while in the former its 
inferences are strictly logical and conclusive as 
well as the sole ground of logical evidence — and 

jrom every relate we infer irresistibly its correlate 

 analogy is therefore the common name 
of all true natural relations universally — the bond 
both of thoughts and of things — the connective of 
nature and truth through which the logical and 
philosophical universe is identified and made in 
telligible and in fine without such universal ana 
logy there could be neither genuine philosophy 
nor logic nor communicable knowledge hence

the prime importance we have claimed for this 
neglected logical mode 

 nothing can be significant but through 
natural or conventional analogy for even asso 
ciations and arbitrary signs are conventional ana 
logies and it afibrds an inevitable presumption of 
the universal nature of this principle that the earliest 
language of mankind and the most powerful elo 
quence of refined thinkers are alike metaphorical 
through analogy — substituting the relations and 
similitudes of one object or class of objects for 
another and that we can no otherwise express our 
most definite and metaphysical notions than through 
similitudes and relations analogically the uni 
versal relation and systematic subordination of 
things upon which their universal analogy depends 
enable us to allegorise and poetise every subject 
with an efiect of seeming reality 

 yet the analogism like the syllogism and 
induction is liable to error and of difiicult use 
from the boundless amount of defective premises 
presented to it demanding adequate discriminative 
powers and capacity in the logician and a strong 
guard against superstition and mysticism to which 
remote analogous premises are liable to conduct by 
constructing false and arbitrary relations and un 
natural and false unities rhetorically arid fancifully 
but as genuine philosophy advances by means of 
analogy it will reciprocate support and confirm the 
logical foundation of analogism

their descendants have dealt greatly in analogies 
the harmony of the spheres which pythagoras

called music metaphorically although grosser minds

real to the edification of satirists who find in me 
taphors and allegories food for ridicule

similar or in what they be unlike or dissimilar

 thus also are all parahles hoth sacred 
and secular and those especially of christ true 
analogical reasonings and arguments and the pro 
per caution only in the use of such as throughout 
logic is to establish correct premises so that the 
relations or analogies we employ should be natural 
coincident exact and true 

 that the best things are misapplied and

of analogy which extends to all things and re

of that strength of concurring circumstances that 
often exceeds direct testimoiy in establishing truth

nances or interpretation of laws and our divines 
appeal through analogy of nature to deity in aid of 
revelation and the scriptures 

 as every just argument and logical infer 
ence must be founded on some true analogy so 
must every false judgment and inference spring 
from some apparent but false analogy whence 
truth being but one and falsehood and error infi 
nite a vulgar prejudice has arisen against analogy 
it is hence evident how essential it is to establish 
the philosophy of analogy universally for the per 
fecting of truth and logic 

 to grasp truth of things and thoughts as 
material or spiritual substances is comparatively 
easy but to grasp truth in relations requires a 
nicety of poise that is difficult to the undisciplined 
mind for if truth and knowledge be as they 
are nothing else than correlation of analogy 
then to lean on either of the correlates as an 
absolute ground is to miss the relation and the 
truth 

 it is no wonder therefore that men in 
seeking truth in the absolute so constantly fall short 
of or overshoot it nor that the progress of reason 
which is truth of relation only makes slow ad 
vances and that analogy which is relation of rela 
tions — truth of truths — has not found many advo 
cates in the ordinary run of minds either as idealist 
or materialist as dogmatic or sceptic nor at all as 
egotist

 men seek the solidity of truth — a relation 
— in an absolute substance ideal or real but 
god hangeth and balanceth the world upon no 
thing mind is a process altogether and the 
knowledge it has of truth is the relation it pro 
duces it does not energize things but relations 
and these it connects through analogy or relation 
of relations while the absolute is altogether beyond 
its sphere — a relation above it 

q hence again nothing can be known but 
relations for though we acknowledge their corre 
lates these being the conditions of the relation and 
knowledge must be for ever unknown just as the 
positive and negative correlates of electricity 
remain totally unperceived until as conditions they 
are brought into new or varied relation and ren 
dered sensible in spark shock sound taste or 
smell but these physical and metaphysical condi

be resolved are analogous and identical in intellect 
and substantially referable to universal and divine 
intellect and being who is — all in all — and every 
where always i and however the prepossessed mind 
may struggle for other foundations suited to false 
intents or gross prejudices it will only flounder 
from one difficulty to another and all the inquiries 
of the sincere and adequate intellect must terminate 
in the humble confession that man can know nothing 
finally but himself and god and these only through

 as to false analogies they are of easy 
solution being in general false inductions — infer

cally but logically and to become logically autho 
ritative and unerring analogy must be founded on 
direct real natural conscious and true relations 
and although it may be illustrative it can be of no

so much by way of introduction we proceed to 
more strictly regard the analogism as a logical 
orgauj which although not hitherto admitted by 
logicians as a lawful organ has been most con 
stantly and remarkably employed by them on all 
occasions as a spurious weapon and persuasive 

 before the time of aristotle every mode of 
argument and the whole of logic was rhetorical 
but he having assigned induction to rhetoric and 
confined logic to the syllogistic form as bacon did 
to the inductive they both consigned analogism to 
rhetoric notwithstanding it is allowed to be theo 
retically perfect in mathematical proportions and 
that discursive analogy is practically and philoso 
phically essential in physics

have endeavoured to clear the ground 

 by analogy arnxoyai we here under

relation for reason and relation are the same or 
in fewer words analogy is parity of reasons or 
relations and by the term analogism we denote 
a form of logism or mode of ratiocination from 
equal reasons reciprocal relations or equation 
through which we descend in subordination from 
universal relations through the general to the par 
ticular transcendentally and analytically and do so 
upon this principle law or canon of all logic and 
of the analogism first and especially that no rela 
tion is conceivable without correlatives 
whence the correlations or reasons of the universal 
and genus are inclusively also the correlations or 
reasons of the species and individual analogically 
throughout logic 

 upon this depends all ratiocination for if 
there were not such fundamental analogy or uni 
versal relation and subordination in the nature and 
constitution of both thoughts and things separately

and reciprocally in vain should we attempt to 
reason or inquire concerning them because without 
such coordination all would be confusion of thoughts 
and confounding of things or a chaos of thoughts 
and things and words being the representatives of 
thoughts and things ought also to have the same 
analogy 

 hence the validity of the premises in all 
the modes of ratiocination depends upon their ex 
hibiting in adequate terms the true relations of 
words thoughts and things and hence it becomes 
a universal logical axiom equally applicable to each 
of the modes that the conclusion is no farther valid 
and true than are its premises and proves no more 
than they truly contain or imply 

 to conclude and to include are therefore 
logically synonymous thus in the judgments of 
necessary relation or analogy there is a reciprocal 
conclusion of the correlatives as the conception of 
father and son mutually include and therefore con 
clude each other reciprocally nor have we a single 
idea or thought that stands alone or independent of 
relations and we may in all cases assert truly such 
essential relations and conclude logically whatever 
the admitted or given premises truly include and 
no more and this although attained in a different 
course comports with the loile of aristotle which 
attributes to the species whatever is predicated of 
its genus it does not follow nevertheless but 
that true conclusions mav be drawn from false

premises if the latter are wide enough to contain 
them although it is the admirable pioperty of 
truth that falsehood which owes all the force it 
ever has to some sort of connexion with truth 
does not spring from it in any case 

 if therefore to infer means to bring into 
or under then does it denote inferiority and as 
conclusion signifies illation or inference in logic so 
to conclude is to include in an argument and the 
premises of an argument or ratiocination are supe 
rior to the conclusion or inference which is infe 
rior or comes under it it is therefore we repeat 
the very essence of logical conclusion to infer some 
thing inferior to or included in the premises and 
not to disclose or generate as some imagine new 
and extraneous truths for this is the office of philo 
sophy it may seem otherwise in the induction or 
generalogism which from particulars infers genera 
of greater extent and appears to generate truths 
but it conclusions are nevertheless invalid beyond 
the particulars premised and are liable to assume 
false as true 

q it follows that no organ or operation of 
logic can have the power of generating or be 
getting truths but merely of displaying the truths 
involved in their premises according to the uniform 
regulation of all nature it being not the object of 
logic to beget truth but conviction truth being 
nothing else than logical relationy or agreement

 the sole principle of logical inference 
whatever be the mode or instrument employed is 
the connecting two or more extremes by a third or 
mean and thereby producing a logical unity or 
identification when therefore we aim at proof 
by analogism similitude or comparison we esta 
blish two extremes between which a true connecting 
mean is alone required to perfect a logical con

analogised the failures of this mode are ac 
cordingly principally referable to the remoteness of 
the extremes whereby the identification or relation 
of the mean is weakened in proportion to the de 
gree of remoteness and it is the same throughout 
logic 

 all the inferences of reason by which 
from two or more known things we justly conclude 
a third or other things required are therefore 
without exception inferences of necessary relation 
or analogy including every true and perfect de

 there is hence no other foundation for

what do we do in all our reasonings and conclusions 
but produce or determine a unity which is to shew 
by an equation that this thing is the same as that 
or that these things are one or analogous f every 
unity or whole is the sum of its relations or

 as however truths in the abstract and

another — and hence that may be true and analo

referable to nature so is the remedy for all clash

analogous relations which are admitted and exist 
fundamentally the artificial ground being thereby 
removed

thing out of consciousness it is truth of sense that 
is objective truth — an effect — a fact or philosophic 
truth and thus the phases of truth vary with the 
phases of consciousness and science 

 hence all logical evidence rests originally 
upon that analogy or universal relation where 
in the subjective significative and objective 
systems coincide and concur and thereby render 
knowledge uniform consistent and conclusive and 
thus the analogical process is at the foundation of 
the other modes 

 it is not however to be wondered at that 
this process should not have been early unfolded 
nor ought we to expect its perfect developement in 
the commencement because it depends primarily 
upon a perfect developement of the universal ob 
jective system of which at the same time it must 
be the principal means whence it depends als 
upon a like perfect developement of the universal 
subjective system or of mind no less than also on a 
perfectly significative system or a perfectly ana 
logous language and these may serve to explain 
why a thing so evident as reasoiing by analogy 
and so common in its discursive form should yet 
have produced no attempt to discover its laws and 
reduce it to science in the manner of the other 
modes which had like most things imperfect be

greatest of logicians has remarked are not only 
the chief but the most difficult parts of a per 
formance 

 although the analogism is hardly in any 
form recognised as a mode of logic and not at all 
as a legitimate organ it is nevertheless of the com 
monest use all the illustrations of argument and 
discourse consisting in comparison and analogy 
and it is owing perhaps to this very reason that 
it is not so regarded on the other hand the syl 
logism which is of all the modes the least natural

rally regarded as the almost sole instrument of 
logic yet the essential diflference of analogical 
reasoning from the syllogistical and the inductive 
has been universally admitted by logicians we 
therefore innovate little in logic by treating it as 
 distinct organ 

 analogy as a manner of reasoning could 
not escape the penetration of aristotle nor the 
sagacity of bacon who have accordingly each 
just noticed and named it not however in its 
correct and universal sense for which an adequate 
basis was wanted but regarding it not as neces 
sary and demonstrative but as fictitious and illus 
trative both these and succeeding writers and

that conviction in every case is founded upon either

 aristotle was undoubtedly aware also of

analogical foundation and accordingly attempted

these as anciently collected and arranged by ari 
stotle and as applied by kant in our time are 
arbitrary arrangements rather than necessary 
logical and universal elements into which never

 the categories as collected by aristotle 
and delivered at the beginning of his organon

existence substance subsistence substratum 
matter and thing absolute quantitt 
quality relation space place and 
where time when position posture

 quantity — quality — relation — 



 

 space — time position — possession action — passion 



 essence or substance and qualities 
have both been used to drive each other out of 
being by arguments which either make substance 
everything and qualities nothing or vice versa 
make qualities substances and substances quali 
ties in pure substance there is passivity only — 
and activity only in qualities and as one of these 
cannot be without the other or action without 
reaction they arc correlatives of which analogy

supplies the logical mean or connecting third 
space and tine have the same analogy and 
quantity is their connecting mean or genus so 
position and possession are analogous qualities 
and action and passion are prime relations 

 time and space ahout the nature and 
attributes and reality of which common sense has 
no difficulty have been called the stumblingblocks 
of the philosopher and have been very variously 
interpreted aristotle truly regarded them as cate 
gories or universal principles with whom some 
have regarded them as ideas of the mind and 
most others as perceptions of sense but none 
have satisfactorilv determined their true nature and 
relations 

 analogical philosophy determines them to 
be universal ontological principles time being 
the most general or universal form of activity or 
action — space the most general form of passivity 
receptivity or reaction — that they are correlative 
extremes of which motion is the correlate mean 
and measure and assigns to them three correla 
tive disciplines or instrumental sciences viz 
arithmetic or the science of times geometry the 
science of space and mechanics the science of 
motion 

 thus the categories and postpredica 
ments are analogically resolved through all exist 
ence and consciousness from relations of action 
and passion into quantities of time and space

and qualities of possession and position whence 
the correlate universality or identity of mind 

 it follows as a corollary from the fore 
going analysis of the categories that whatever 
exists is either quantity quality or relation 
the most universal relation is that of action and 
passion the most universal qtmlities are those of 
possession and position and the most universal 
quantities are time and space 

 and this distribution of the categories is 
authorized by the stagyrite and his followers who 
regard essence or substance as first and chief 
among the categories and quantity quality and 
relation as of secondary importance the others 
are consequently subordinate to these 

 it is to be remarked however that the 
essence or primary matter of things and thoughts 
as the necessary condition of knowledge must be 
in itself unknowable and that quantity and quality 
are relations and upon these the other categories 
depend hence relation and essence or the rela 
tive and the absolute are the most universal or 
first categories — the matter and manner of all 
knowledge 

 things may therefore be considered as 
known or as existing and since nothing can be 
known but relations or the manner of being in 
things the next universal genera of things or pre 
dicaments arc those universal relations to which 
they may be referred in our knowledge we err

therefore when we regard knowledge as compre 
hending the absolute in things notwithstanding this 
is an error more vulgar than that of regarding as 
real the apparent or relative diurnal motion of the 
sun it follows hence that all our conceptions of 
things as ahsolutey or independent of the mind are 
but figurative or ectypal through analogy and that 
all our real and archetypal conceptions belong to 
the mind as analogous relations 

 space we have defined the most general 
form of passivity or passion and tims the most 
general form of activity or action whence uni 
versal passivity or space is the universe and uni 
versal activity or time is eternity each may be 
proved by analysis or synthesis and both are corre 
lative through antithesis each hieing the measure of 
the others through number and motion finally 
being universal they are categories conjointly 
expressed by the term existence 

 hence if we generalise every special and 
particular passivity we universalise them into 
space if we also generalise every special and 
individual action we also universalise them in 
time and as every eflfect resolves into action 
and passion so all existence resolves into time 
and space finally as space and time resolve 
into passion and action which never subsist apart 
so the latter unite knowledge as the prime gate 
goryy relation thus exhibited in the following 
table —

existence 

the term existence may be substituted by that of 
cause which has precisely the same generic rela 
tions and principles as we have shewn that enery 
cause comprises an agent and patient in its 
effect — that in material cause and effect its pa 
tient is external or material its agent medial or 
sensible and the fact external — that in seisible 
cause and effect the agent is external the pa 
tient internal and the effect medial and that in 
intellectual cause and effect the patient is medial 
the agent internal and the truth or nome inter 
nal the whole of which strictly coincides with the 
above arrangement 

 it is apparent then that the categories 
are no other than genera or universal relations 
of being or modes of existenccy and that if the 
external medial and internal are the most uni 
versal relations of existence and that the relation 
of quantity is external that of quality medial 
and that of relation itself internal then has 
aristotle justly regarded these as prime categories 
of which the others are species and we are justified 
in the analogical distribution we have given them

further agreeably to which quantity is the chief 
category of discipline as relation is of science 
and quality is of art art including figure and

 that aristotle regarded his own collection 
of categories as incomplete is evident from the 
addition he made of his postpredicaments of 
prioty subsequent opposite simultaneous and

others is also apparent from the additions and

which comprehends them all 

 to the postpredicaments aristotle also 
superadded the universal term cause involving all 
other categories and variously distinguished it as 
material formal and finals to which numberless 
others have been added and in modem times this 
category of cause has taken precedence of all other 
predicaments and conducted to a fallacious scep 
ticism only resolvable through analogy by the uni 
versal fact that cause consists in concurrence 
for effect being the correlative or analogue of 
cause and an agent and patient being coessential 
to every effect all cause becomes resolved into 
action and passion or reaction which are the 
primary analogical correlatives of existence and 
relation universally and as the foundation of all

our philosophical universals and also with the first 
position of our philosophy in which we define a 
system to be a united variety of parts or principles 
coordinate or related to some end or purpose 
with these also the subject predicate or attri 
bute and conclusion and the three terms major 
minor and consequent of logic correspond 

 in what other manner these categories 
comprehend the universe has appeared also in 
our first chapter together with the genera and 
species dependent upon them namely the ex 
ternal or physiological the internal or nouo 
logical and the medial or philological c nor

agree with the ancients in their subordinate cate 
gories for time and space comprehend all ex 
ternal or material quantities as position and 
possession do all medial or sensible qualities and 
action and passion all internal or intellectual 
relations and notwithstanding the equivocalness 
of the ancient categories this appropriation is so 
suitable and easy that we may reasonably consider 
them as the relics of a more ancient and similar 
philosophy 

 at all events the true source and gene 
alogy of the categories have been unnoticed and 
as far as appears were unknown to aristotle him 
self who is said to have borrowed them from 
ocellus lucanus and archytas the tarentine 
who again founded them upon the decalogue of 
pythagoras called also the table of alcmaeon and 
as pythagoras drew his philosophy from the egyp 
tian and eastern sages and modem researches into 
the ancient literature of india and the east have 
disclosed doctrine consonant to the categories 
there is reason for referring them to a time and 
country more ancient and remote than greece 

 it is held to be contrary to logical rule 
to argue from one category to another and that 
reason even fails altogether when we quit the 
category of any inquiry but this is not entirely 
true since one category contains others and there 
is in strictness but one absolute category — a single 
analogical universal only

s it is the same when we argue from one 
species to another and still more so in arguing 
from genus to genus under any category the 
relations becoming weaker and weaker as they be 
come more remote but still there is analogy and 
true ground in each case and throughout this 
law of logicians is therefore to be held with limi 
tation and it is still contrary to just argument to 
quit the category unnecessarily or to call in the 
remote instead of the immediate or near at hand 
but it is perfectly lawful to strengthen the final 
judgment universally for perfect conviction

 having thus shewn the necessary uni

manner in which these universals coincide with 
and comprehend the categories upon which aris 
totle rested the validity of the syllogistic process 
for the hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms 
resolve into the categorical we may proceed in 
our attempt to develope the instrumentality of the 
analogism the fundamental organ of logic 

 since then all reasons are analogous re 
lations which are the sole matter or substance of 
logic and since correlatives demonstrate each other 
immediately or by necessary inference and imply 
equality or reciprocalness analogism concludes

from tlie equal reasons or relations of things im 
mediately and essentially or from known relatives 
deduces their less known correlatives 

 and as universal relations comprehend a 
subordination of particular relations so the uni 
versal analogism comprehends a like subordination 
both of which are unfolded by analysis we there 
fore distinguish analogisms as universal and par 
ticular and these again we divide into single or 
simple and general plural or compound such 
are the distinctions of the logical analogism 
founded on the immediate parities of reason as 
distinguished from the rhetorical or philological 
analogism which belongs to the remote simili 
tudes of nature and imagination both however 
resolving into the same universal analogy 

 as the premises upon which the first dis 
tinction of the logical analogism is framed are 
necessary and universal and those of the second 
or particular may be in themselves arbitrary or 
granted the first are categorical and the latter 
may be called hypothetical between which lies 
the popular or general analogism which is rheto 
rical and philological and concludes from parallel 
relations and similitudes and this maybe called 
disjunctive and conjunctive 

 in this the analogism resembles the syl 
logism that it is either categorical hypothetical 
or disjunctive and it resembles the syllogism 
herein also that the two latter of these the 



digitized by

analogism 

hypothetical and disjunctive resolve into the first 
or categorical and they both terminate in the 
identification of relations i e in analogy 

 and in their application the categorical 
analogism is theoretical and principal in intel 
lectual and ethical science the hypothetical 
analogism is practical and principal in material 
and physical science and the disjunctive analo 
gism is discursive and principal in sensible and 
jesthetical science including the philological and 
rhetorical 

 further the three modes or forms of the 
analogical organ are severally distinguishable into 
analogisms of reason and of fact — the first 
d priori the latter a posteriori — the one express 
ing the relations of active and passive intellect 
the other the affinities of nature through sense 

 thus the primary triad of colours is a 
categorical fact a posteriori and that of sounds is 
another whence may be analogized and inferred all 
the relations of chromatic and harmonic science 
and in like manner every science has its elemen 
tary categorical fact or reason to which it en 
tirely refers for its relations and whence it may 
be wholly deduced and also connected with the 
whole of science logically or categorically through 
universal analogy 

 as the categorical analogism compre 
hends all necessary relations i e relations of rea 
son or of fact traceable to universality all necessary

relations whether universal general or particular 
a priori or a posterioriy are by reference cate 
gorical so the hypothetical analogism formed 
upon assumed or possible relations may be either 
universal general or special and so also the dis 
junctive analogism which argues from parity of 
reason or probable relations lies between the cate 
gorical and hypothetical analogisms and may also 
be universal general or particular for of these 
distinctions there are no definable limits 

 hence we analogize categorically only 
on necessary relations hypotheticauy on assumed 
real and probable or conditional relations and 
disjunctively and discursively upon parity of reason 
or possibility of relations or by similitude 

 yet analogy to become logically conclu 
sive must be between things of the same nature 
or homogeneous thus for example we cannot 
conclude through any real parity of reasons from 
the doctrine of sounds produced by vibrations that 
colours or other objects of sense are also produced 
by vibrations because these things differ in nature 
or are heterogeneous but parities of relation or 
analogy in things of the same genus are conclusive 
and certain 

 of these three forms we will speak first 
of the two logical forms the categorical or 
theoretical analogism and the hypothetical or 
practical analogism and finally of the disjunct 
tive or discursive analogism which is philological

or rhetorical and these forms coincide with the 
matter of logic or propositions the categorical 
analogism being imperative the hypothetical in 
quisitive and the disjunctive analogism assertive 



section v 

 the categorical or theoretical ana 
logism is apodictical and from two evident co 
equal relations or extremes infers logically or 
concludes their equal mean and again by ana 
lysis it takes of the concluded mean two other 
equal extremes in evidence of another included 
mean relation — thus descending from the universal 
and general through the less general to the par 
ticular and as the extremes and media in this 
process are in equal relation or strictly analogous 
and therefore reciprocal and simultaneous either 
of the three terms may become extreme or mean 
to the others reciprocally hence this analogism 
is a triple syllogism comprehending three syllo 
gisms or particular conclusions under a general 
and universal dependence and is hence of irre 
fragable strength 

 thus for example the subject or that 
which perceives or sees and the object or that 
which is perceived or seen are equal terms or 
extremes and have the relation of antecedent and 
consequent reciprocally and require no common

term to unite them in a judgment but they imply 
or include the perception or viewy in which they 
concur and these three — the subject the object 
and the view are coessential and by implication 
and logical inference conclude each other recipro 
cally they argue in a universally coincident 
circle as major minor and consequent they in 
clude and therefore conclude as irresistibly as the 
most perfect syllogism each depending upon cor 
rect premises and this may serve as example of 
the simple universal analogism further — 

 between the philosophic mindj as subject 
and the philosophic universe as object lies phi 
losophy or science as view in like reciprocal rela 
tion and coincidence take now either member 
or premiss of this analogism for example phi 
losophy or science and separate its extremes 
namely physical and intellectual science between 
which according to the same universal reason or 
category of relation lies sensible science as a mean 
and so on again with either of these terms and 
their subordinates in search of particular know 
ledge or science 

 and this is an example in the first stage 
of the compound or plural analogism which may 
sufficiently indicate the categorical or universal 
analogism in this place 

 of the power of this process in the esta 
blishment and rectification of principles we have

annulling the sceptical argument founded on the

 but all categorical analogisms are axio

of reason as well as an axiom in mathematics as 
complete in correlation as that of father mother j 
and offsprings or the agents patient and effect of

as the most perfect syllogisms and convertible into

as to be overlooked or so evident as to be admitted 
without question or are axioms worthy of authority 
on credit although they appear inexplicable 

 analogism is a test of axioms by analysis

of matter and hume by an easy eflfort turned 
the force of the argument against its author and 
shewed that we have no better knowledge of the

up a scepticism that ousts the world altogether 
and from which there is no escape but by the in 
tervention of analogism establishing a mean of 
necessary connexion of its three terms through 
universal relation or reason 

 if therefore there is a medial world of 
knowledge internal and external — of mind mat 
ter and sense — a categorical analogism will be 
established on necessary reason beyond which 
the only shift of scepticism is to question the exist 
ence of knowledge and therewith that also which 
knows and that which is known which terminates 
all argument in nihilism and absurdity thus the 
philosophic universe — the world of knowledge — 
is essentially founded on categorical analogism all

through analogisms universal general or par

that nature has neither deceived nor sported with

true or false for to all internal effect — under

as coessentiat or analogous as they are to external

 thus is philosophy reconciled to piety

 whatever mind can conceive genius in

there has not hitherto been any art or science of

from the truth of these premises that the means

be anticipated only through universal relation or

by incidental analogies have been led to eminent

 that analogism under logical regulation

inquiring mind to particular inventions and dis 
coveries that may have been overlooked for their 
obviousness or simplicity we can in some measure 
testify by examples from our own experience op 
ticians from the time of ptolemy to the present 
day have regarded optical glasses called lenses 
as of plane and curved figures only but of these 
angular figure is the analogical third and of the 
three all possible lensic figures are composed and 
although modem opticians have employed the

occurred to them to construct prismic or angular 
lensesf to which we were led by reflecting on the 
forms and offices of the prism and lens and by 
regarding plane and curved lenses as analogical 
extremes of which the angular or prismic lens 
or lensic prism is the logical and geometrical 
mean afibrding a new instrument in chromatic 
optics whereby we have raised a science of colours 
from elements entirely analogical and extensively

 again the ancient greek artists held that 
the figure of a wellformed man with the limbs 
spread and extended will be exactly included in a 
circle of which the centre will coincide with the 
navel as in fig and vitruvius and other

which we could supply many such instances as the 
following regarding the nail and the screw of

by the percussion of the point in a right line the 
other forced by a circular motion it became appa

in our outlines of analogical philosophy and 
 synopsis in which whether we have succeeded 
in any degree or not we may claim to have pointed 
out a way for its attainment and indicated that 
unity of conception which is alone worthy of that 
universal being who has formed and sustains the 
universe and is unity itself — the fountain of all 
reason and truth — the logos of all 

such is the chief object of the analogism the 
general neglect of which method may serve as an 
excuse for our autological illustrations of its utility 

 every natural and logical analogism 
consists of two extremes and a mean or media 
in some cases this is obvious and applied in which 
the mean is real and principal as that of a mort 
gage to a mortgagor and mortgagee but in most 
cases the logical mean is to be sought and in 
either case the three members of an analogism are 
essential to complete inference and knowledge 

 there are cases of analogism however in 
which the mean is apparent and the extremes are 
obscure remote or occult as we have seen in the 
relation of cause and effect the extremes of which 
are latent or concealed being action and passion 
the coessential extremes of this relation coincident 
and hidden in the term cause on account of its 
correlation with effect and hence has arisen 
much misunderstanding throughout philosophy 
wherein efltect has been referred to cause as 
extremes without a mean although action and re

action or passion are coessential to every effect 
and constitute its cause whence hume not per 
ceiving the mearij denied their logical connexion 

 as the analogisra to be perfect must 
consist of parts members or premises which taken 
together contain neither more nor less than the 
whole of their subject and as it requires coequal 
extremes in evidence of an equal mean it is prin 
cipally applicable to intellectual science and uni 
versals in which these complete and necessary 
relations are principally found and the highest 
and most important of all the applications of the 
universal form of the analogism is that in which 
it rises to subjects purely intellectual and divine 
to subjects purely ethical and theological — the 
spirit of man and the spirit of god — subjects 
concerning which the analogism can alone afford 
satisfactory logical conclusions 

 yet the analogism descends with propor 
tionate degrees of evidence to the minutest par 
ticulars of nature and science of which we have 
given extended examples synthetically in our 

 chromatics the analogism is however chiefly 
analytical and as generalogism or indtiction is 
the artijicial procedure toward theory or science 
synthetically y so is analogism the true scientific 
procedure in the researches of practice or art 
analytically and the readiest and most efficient

section vi 

 the hypothetical or practical ana 
logism is an inquiry in which we assume two 
extremes real or imagined in search of a required 
mean or particular it diflfers from the cate 
gorical analogism in this that its extremes or 
premises are not universal or necessary but con 
ditional or arbitrary and it is applicable to all 
kinds of topics and subjects in every such ana 
logism the extremes must be limited to determine 
tbe analogical mean thus if the question be 
concerning the best literary composition clearing 
the ground from pedantry and fashion which dis 
guise the subject the best words are those st 
which convey the signification best and dly most 
agreeably as extremes but some writers think 
only on the meaning in the choice of words and 
they compose without grace on one extreme and 
others regard only the agreeable and these com 
pqse without sense or signification on the other 
to unite qr ace with sense is therefore the 
perfection of composition — its rational analogic 
mean 

 the hypothetical analogism may be prac 
tically exemplified in the adjustment of proportions

predicated of or deduced from particulars these 
modes are therefore antithetical or opposed 

 nevertheless this mode may reciprocate 
light with the method of bacon and especially on 
those parts of the novum organum of which he 
delivered the titles but omitted the details so far 
as they may be adequately understood viz the 
helps of induction the rectification of in 
duction the method of varying inquiries 
the prerogative natures for inquiry the li 
mits of inquiry the reduction of inquiries to 
practice the preliminaries to inquiry and 
 the ascending and descending scale of axioms 
—commented on by dr shaw to all which sub 
jects the analogism may contribute and apply 

 the hypothetical analogism will afford 
also perfect conclusions in the determination of 
mathematical ratios and analogous quantities or 
proportionals which are justly considered by bar 
row as drawn not from any induction but from 
a universal discursus without determining what 
process or discursus although it is evident it is not 
syllogistical 

 of such among other examples and much 
to the purpose of our argument he gives us the 
following — let there be a circle whose centre 
is z fig and two angles at the centre a z b 
and m z n standing upon the arches a b and

m n let any multiple of the arch a b suppose 
the triple a d he assumed and let z d he con 
nected it appears from the third element that 
the angle a z d is also triple the angle a z b 
then let any multiple of the arch m n he taken 
suppose the douhle m o and let z o be connected 
in like manner it appears that the angle m z o is 
douhle the angle m z n but if the angle a z d 
exceed the angle m z o from what is demon 
strated in the third element the arch a d will 
also exceed the arch m o and if that equal that 
also this will equal this and if a defect he there 
also a defect will be here therefore it is shewn 
that the said condition agrees with these quantities

reason of their agreement in some third thing ac 
cording to the logical maxim yariously repeated

strictly analogical as we have shewn and every

and arguments are founded on and consist in ana 
logical comparison to find out the logical agree

lated we compare them with some third thing with 
which they are in mutual relation or analogous 
in doing which we compare and syllogize whence 
the above logical maxim coincides with the mathe

as facts 

 regarding therefore the same universal 
analogy as established internally and externally — 
physically and logically and throughout science 
we thus analogised from the one to the other by 
conveying the two colours of a compound hue se

their intermediate third experimentally st by 
throwing them into the visual organs from the solar 
spectrum apart but simultaneously and afterwards 
repeating the experiment with simple light through 
coloured glasses by thus conducting yellow light

that the hgfpotheticaiy or practical analogisnij is a 
mode not so much of reason as of experience and 
therefore its logical evidence is proportionately less 
perfect and less logically conclusive than that of 
the categoricalf or theoretical analogismt upon 
which it is founded and which belongs primarily 
to reason and concludes necessarily between 
these as extremes may be inferred an infinite 
analogical series varying in degrees of evidence 
and variously dependent on reason and sense or 
experience nevertheless the premises of the 
practical analogism being unigenial or the same

discursive analogism 

 the discursive or rhetorical process is 
so common under the phrase of reasoning hy ana 
logy that it needs not an example and it is the 
mode in which the logic of analogy has been alone 
recognised and to which it has been almost ex 
clusively confined being a form of ratiocination 
extremely popular and of vast rhetorical use for 
the analogies and similitudes of things owing to a 
latent sentiment or consciousness of universal 
relation which belongs essentially to the mind 
become delightful to the imagination and flattering 
to the judgment which recognises them when in 
the same case the induction would prove laborious 
and the syllogism dry 

 it has however been urged that the dis 
cursive analogism illustrates without proving but 
since it depends onginally upon universal relations 
it proves in proportion to the intimacy of relation 
it discloses in the premises hence this mode is 
conclusive when the relation of comparison or 
analogy lies in nature and is sophistical or illus 
trative only when such natural relation is wanting 
it is accordingly of greatest force when the sub 
jects or premises compared are homogeneous or 
lie near together in the system of things and it is 
proportionately of less force or null when the 
relations of its subjects lie more remotely or not 
at all in nature and authorise the negative maxim 
omne simile non est idem the analogism is 
therefore only perfectly conclusive when the coin

cidence it discloses can be traced to universality in 
things of the same nature 

 this mode of analogism includes the 
paradigm of the greeks with every kind of 
example comparison simile metaphor and 
parable and every species of metonymy trope 
and figure each of which is significant through 
analogy of nature or relation and the parable was 
the chief form of teaching adopted beautifully and 
eflpectively by the saviour of mankind whereby he 
brought eternal things home to the business and 
bosoms of his followers and this with the most 
natural and rational propriety for this mode affords 
a first step to the logical understanding ere it is 
trained and qualified for the strict operations and 
apodictical conclusions of reason hence also it 
afforded the logic and ornaments of the poets and 
inventors of fables the first teachers of mankind 
through imagination ere reason had established its 
authority 

 with homogeneous and forcible analogy 
did alfred the great in his paraphrase of boetius 
answer the question concerning freewillf origin

monarch and a man on the principle of human and 
divine dignity regarding it as contrary to the

 the disjunctive analogism neither build 
ing immediately upon universal relations as the 
categorical analogism does nor borrowing its pre 
mises from induction of sense or experience like 
the hypothetical analogism but arguing from 
similitude occupies the ground between the two 
latter modes whence its vast application and ex 
tent j and hence the reason why it has been re 
garded as exclusively analogical lord bacons 
doctrine of conformable instances may serve as an 
illustration of this mode or form of analogismt 
which in following a triadic distribution resembles 
the dialectic of zeno eleates employed by plato 

 the most familiar illustration of the logi 
cal relations of analogy in general may perhaps 
be taken from human pedigree or genealogy which 
is perfect in father mother and oflpspring is strict 
also in the first remove of uncle aunt and cousin 
in both of which the mean of logical and natural 
relation is apparent as it is also in a second re 
move with an added mean and so on in declining 
series to the remotest remove with multiplied 
media if we seek the cross or collateral and con 
ventional relations analogy and affinity become 
obscure and complex in proportion to remoteness

and although family likeness remains apparent and 
resemblance extends even to a nation or a people 
an entire logical pedigree requires in all cases a 
long demonstration ihence in remote relations of 
persons and things we content ourselves with re 
semblances and similarities in place of logical 
proofs and unbroken genealogies and denote them 
by the rhetorical term analogy y or likeness 

 it is the same in the relations of things 
universally which are strict and identical in their 
original parents or first principles and early off 
spring — abound with similitudes of sense and 
resemblances in their remotest relations which 
indicate only their genuine intermediate kindred 
and true universal logical analogy through which 
they are connected as a family of families or 
sciences of which the pedigrees and parities when 
truly unfolded display a universal system 

 in such complication of natural and logical 
relations it is not astonishing that the understand 
ing becomes confounded and lost to strict logical 
genealogy the only adequate remedy for which is 
to retrace the system of knowledge and science 
from its origin tracing individuals into families 
and families home to the first parent — or the 
whole through analogy from its first principle and 
beginning 

 it is from conviction of this universal 
relation and dependence that we rely on the uni

general relations and finally mount synthetically 
to the categorical relations of universal analogy

is truth in the individuals is truth also in gene 
rals and the universal hence the analogism

authority in coincidence with the generalogism or

visitation of cortes or the visit of columbus nor 
even atheists if there be such monsters unlikely 
to fall down and worship yet must we not infer 
the probability nor hardly admit the possibility of 
such an issue although we cannot deny this form of 
analogy 

 of the three modes of anaiogism the 
categorical infers from necessary real and iden 
tical relations — the hypothetical analogism con 
cludes from assumed relations of any genus — 
and the disjunctive or discursive analogism 
argues from one category genus species or in 
dividual to another or others through remote 
disjointed real or assumed relations it is ap 
parent also that these modes engage variously the 
different faculties of the mind — that the caie 
gorical mode depends on the rational faculty 
while the discursive engages the imagination either 
literally metaphorically or mystically whence the 
common reasoning by analogy frequently misleads 
the judgment and although it is often extremely 
ingenious it has by confounding relations brought 
discredit on analogical reasoning in general and 
frustrated the disclosure and introduction of its 
genuine and strictly logical modes into science

introduction 



 having in the precediog part sketched 
our outline of the analogism as the initiate organ 
of logici we proceed to give brief analyses of the 
organs of aristotle and bacon as dependent there 
on and as the essentials of an entire system of 
which logic has been hitherto deficient whence 
in a great measure has arisen the neglect and 
failure of this most fundamental and important of 
all the disciplines notwithstanding the zeal and 
tenacity with which it has been maintained in our 
schools in its primitive form without prospect of 
advancement much less of entire renovation or 
completion whence the baconian logic has re 
mained extnuscholastic while that of aristotle

 modern and scholastic logic 

has obtained exclusively the appellation of scw 
lastic into which latter we proceed to inquire 
briefly and to analyse analogically 

 aristotle distributed all knowledge or 
philosophy into physics and metaphysics which 
latter has three functions which he distinguished 
as practicj poetic and theoretic having three 
objects material sensible and intellectual and 
three ends good harmony or beauty and truth 
the third or theoretic he again distributed 
according to analogy into three genera physic 
mathematics and theologic 

 from the middle or matjiematic oenu 
aristotle suspended the syllogism or summing as 
the logic of demonstration but he erred in making 
it universal to the exclusion of the other methods 
whence bacon attached induction or generalo 
gism to the physical oervusj leaving the theologic 
or ethic oenus to which the analooism is ap 
propriate unoccupied although it is specially fun 
damental and a universal logic and consigning 
theology to divinest

its plan is objective or material and sub

dicamentsy or simple notions propositions or 
complex terms and syllogismsy or compound 
propositions as formal it includes definition 
for clear apprehension division for clear distinc 
tionand sogsw for clear conclusion and finally 
method to regulate the whole 

 such is also the general scheme of logic 
which science has retained to this day with little 
alteration or improvement of the matter and method 
of aristotles org anon wherein he constructed 
a partial whole of the syllogistic logic from the 
imperfect use of the instrument by his predeces 
sors as they had employed it in demonstrations 
from the mathematical school of pythagoras who 
established axioms of quantity on behalf of the 
mathematics and the other prime genera or cate 
gories and universals without which there could 
be no syllogism such genera and universals are 
derived from generalogism and analogism and 
as analogism is the logic of universals de 
scending to particulars and oeneralogism is the 
logic of particulars ascending to generals so 
syllogism uniting particular and universal by 
means of genera is the logic of generals or 
media and therefore lies between the two other 
modes

aristotle has remarked arise commonly from small 
beginnings such was the course of syllogism till 
established fully by himself and such that of in 
duction till the time of bacon and that such also 
will be that of analogism ere that and logic 
become established on a solid basis as an entire 
whole we cannot doubt but it will not be long 
delayed when society and the learned are prepared 
for its reception 

 as the triple distribution of the theoretic 
of aristotle into physic mathematicy and theo 
logy coincides with the general distribution of the 
greek philosophy into physics logic and ethics 
so are the three logical organs conformable to 
the like arrangement viz the induction to phy 
sics the syllogism to mathematics and the ana 
logism to metaphysics including ethics and all 
purely intellectual philosophy if therefore we 
rank these organs accordingly the analogism will 
be of as much more importance than the induction 
and syllogism as ethics are than physics and the 
mathematics and although last to take its place 
among the logical organs is every way entitled to 
precedence 

 in proceeding to treat of the syllogism 
our object is not to teach the syllogistic logic as a 
distinct science to which there are already sufficient 
helps but to analyse and place it on its analogical 
foundation in connexion with the whole of logic as

the counterpart of philosophy of the mmor parts 
of the syllogistic logic we have already treated in 
a preceding part in suhordination to our general 
plan of logic it remains only therefore that we 
treat hriefly of the syllogism itself 

 our intention in this outline of the syllo 
gistic organ being to attain its true estimate and 
to illustrate its principles without especial re 
ference to practical logicy to which nevertheless 
they are the most essential aids and corrections we 
need not enter minutely into the technical distinc 
tions of the syllogistic art but refer the practical 
inquirer to the works of its great originator and 
to the best preparative for its study with which we 
are acquainted in the ahis logiccb riulimenta 
with illustrative observations 



section ii 

syllogism 

 the syllogism or middle process of 
logic demonstrates hidden or remote relations by 
a mean or medium common to them as extremes 
or in other words it shews that some particular is 
comprehended in some universal because it is 
comprehended in some general or medium which 
is also comprehended in the same universal as 
two things related to some third thing must also

 syllogism 

be analogously related to each other or quanti 
tatively as fractions are contained in any integer 
by the media of the units which compose it 

 accordingly every perfect syllogism con 
sists of three members which logicians distinguish 
by the terms major minor and middle which 
three terms a b c are interchanged in pairs 
in the three propositions of every syllogism 

 for example we may conclude syllogisti 
cally that the great aristotle was fallible thus 

major — all men b are fallible a — universal extreme 

minor — aristotle c was a man b — general medium 

consequent — ariitotle c was fallible a — particular extreme 

or what b is is a and what c is is b therefore what c is is a 
also whence a b c are identified or collected under the same universal 

 the predicate of the conclusion or con 
sequent fallible a is denominated the major 
or universal term the subject of the conclusion 
aristotle c is the minor or particular term 
and the middle or general term man b connects 
the major and minor in the consequent or con 
clusion 

 the major proposition is so called because 
it contains the major term and the miner propo 
sition is so called because it contains the minor 
term some ambiguity arises hence because the 
middle term and the middle proposition are not 
usually coincident we consider it preferable 
therefore to distinguish terms and propositions 
respectively as universau general or particular

syllogism 

more especially so because any error in the argu 
ment depends upon the irrelation of these and 
becomes immediately apparent in reference to them 

 the consequent of the above syllogism 
may be concluded of all the particulars and media 
comprehended under its universal proposition ac 
cording to the axiom that whatever is affirmed or 
denied of the genus may be affirmed or denied of 
its species and individuals also thus 

i all men are fallible 
philosophers are men 
 philosophers are fallible 

i general the peripatetics are philosophers 

 the peripatetics are fallible 
particular aristotle was a peripatetic 
 aristotle was fallible 

the above is an example of the parenthetical or 
compound syllogism or variously as the prosyllo 
gtsm episyuogism and sorites as the former is of 
the simple syllogism 

 the elliptical syuom or enthymemcf is 
that in which either the universal term or the 
medium is implied though not expressed as for 
example 

since all men are fallible 
aristotle was fallible 

there are thus in every syllogism three proposi 
tions enunciations or judgments a universal a 
general and a particular expressed or understood

 stllogism 

and each of these propositions is in like manner 
constituted of three terms or conceptions of rela 
tion similar to the ahove and called the subject 
predicate and copula for example 

subject — all men — universal 
copula — are — general 

predicate — fallible — particular — 

the same of the others also 

 that which is true universally is true 
also of the genera — that which is true genericauy 
is true also of its species — that which is true spe 
cifically is true also of its individuals the greater 
in each case is the major to the lesser or minor 
under it and consequently the least may be con 
cluded of the greatest by medium of the minor 
thus in the compound syllogism preceding uni 
versally all men are fallible major generically 
philosophers are men major also specifically 
peripatetics are philosophers minor individually 
aristotle the peripatetic philosopher is fallible 
consequent however many media 

syllogism therefore cannot properly be called 
deduction or taking from for we do not draw the 
conclusion from the major and minor but infer it 
through them by a universal colligation or sub 
sumption deduction applies in any other sense to 
all the modes 

 if we descend the last step of logical ana 
lysis — that is to the analysis of words or concep 
tions which constitute the propositions of which the

and finally descending to the signification of in 
dividual words these also vary in each as of uni

which their logical power and value depend 

 according to this analysis of the syllo

sitionj or judgment in which the particular is in 
cluded in the general and both these together are 
included in the universal which accords wijth aris 
totles dictum de omni et nullof according to which 
what is predicated of a class universally may be 
predicated also of everything comprehended there 
in or more technically whatever is predicated 
of a distributed or universal term may be pre 
dicated of all under it and we have here traced 
the syllogism to its elements which are terms and 
propositions logically as we before ascended 
to it from their elements philologically the only 
difference here is that that which was a name or a 
proposition with respect to words is a term or a 
judgment with regard to thoughts the proposi 
tion and the syllogism both denote relation or 
necessary analogy the proposition or judgment 
being a sentence which expresses a simple relation 
between at least two words or terms as a syllogism 
is the expression of the compound relations among 
terms and propositions nor can we otherwise infer 
one thing of or from another or others than through 
comparison i e analogy 

 the above is the sole principle of the 
syllogism and to it each of the three figures and 
their modes into which syllogisms are distributed 
are reducible the variety of the figures depends

syllogism 

upon the transposition of the subject predicate 
and medium which are the three essential terms 
of the syllogism as they are also of the simple 
proposition 

 it follows from this analysis of the syllo 
gism and the universal law on which it is founded 
 that no particular inference or conclusion can 
be obtained unless there be a general or generical 
term including it in the premises that no ge 
neral conclusion can be inferred truly unless there 
be in like manner a universal premis nor 
can there be a universal conclusion unless the 
premises be entirely universal in which case the 
syllogism becomes an analogism e g 

of whatever we kuow we are conscious 
whatever we are conscious of exists 
whatever we know exists 

but the premises may be reciprocally asserted and 
are therefore analogical and universal 

 ah the rules of syllogizing and the whole 
structure of artificial logic are subject and re 
ducible to the above law and an attention to the 
clear relation of universal general and parti 
cular or individual will render needless all the 
regulation of distribution of terms and other 
complicated machinery with which practical logic 
is overlaid it cannot therefore be too often or 
variously repeated and inculcated

term of comparison in eqjialj ie analogical re 
lotion to both and there can be no syllogistic in 
ference or final conclusion unless one of the 
terms be universal and ultimately categorical 
which we have seen has a purely analogical basis 

 the simple proposition or judgment is 
also distinguishable into figures and modes accord 
ing to the manner of its including the subject in 
the predicate or of excluding it from the predicate 
as displayed in most treatises on logic on the 
other extreme the compound syllogism prosyllo 
gism or sorites might also be similarly distin 
guished and these are the three members of 
discourse 

 hence the threewr and their mides 
consist only of the several possible interchanges of 
the three terms and their propositions and this is 
common to them all that the minor and major 
terms though variously excepted in the premises 
are posited uniformly in the conclusion all of 
which is very mechanical and of greater curiosity 
than use except in the way of illustration of the 
analogy of reason and the exercise of the logical 
faculty 

 and this variety of distinctions in propo 
sitions and syllogisms is of very little either theo 
retical or practical importance and resolves wholly 
into the analogical principle of comprehension sub 
sumption or inclusion in the premises upon which

syllogism 

all ratiocination is founded for the truth of a pro 
position syllogism or train of reasoning depends 
upon the subordination of relations in the subject 
and predicate throughout 

 the principle of comprehension or inclu 
sion and exclusion is the same in effect as the 
dictum de omni et nvmoy given as the principle 
of the first figure and is that also by extension of 
the other figures whence arises the power of re 
ducing the other figures to the first form of which 
they are only more or less compounded a correct 
understanding of this principle will afford a suffi 
cient test for any argument in which the first in 
quiry is the real question distinguished by its 
logical subject or subjects predicate or predicates 
and middle term or terms and will shew whether 
they are duly subsumpted or included so as to 
afford a cogent and perspicuous conclusion or the 
want of it 

 to perform this syllogistically requires an 
acquaintance with technical logic and some exer 
cise in its discipline but by a knowledge of this 
principle or rule alone we may form a correct 
judgment of the validity invalidity or degree of 
value in every argument whether it belong to the

ever analogism is the logic principally of thought 
and generalogism is that of things so syllogism is

logical rhetorical and grammatical alliances as the 
middle member of discourse and hence also its 
mathematical connexion 

 since the syllogism is no further stable 
and conclusive than are its premises we may go 
on questioning the premises and the premises of 
the premises till we arrive at that which is abso 
lutely primitive or universal — the because relation 
or reason of the whole and if such universal basis 
is not to be found for the premises the conclusion 
falls of course and the syllogism becomes a sophism 
or to speak as a logician the fallacy of a syllogism 
is generally in the universal or major proposition 
for if it be either in the minor or middle propo 
sition it is easily detected 

 as the syllogism is a form of logic be 
tween the analogism and induction so have these 
modes their intermedia partaking of each other 
through analogy although they have been usually 
regarded as irregular syllogisms such is the 
soritesy which subsumpts many particulars and 
media under a universal and the induction itself 
is an endless sorites and on the other hand the 
enthymeme is a syllogism of which one of the pre 
mises is suppressed the conclusion being evident 
through necessary relation or analogism thus of 
this enthymeme — a father is the benefactor of his 
son therefore a son owes duty to his father 
because duty is due to all benefactors which uni 
versal major premis is suppressed and the relation

letween duty and benefit — father and son is 
necessary and analogical and of the soritesy — 
all flowers are beautiful — the rose the tulip 
the jasmine the lily c are flowers — therefore 
the rose c each and all are beautiful — by 
induction or generalogism 

 it has been questioned whether every syl 
logism is not sophistical under the class of petitio 
prindpiiy since it takes that for granted in the uni 
versal which is to be proved in the particular 
hence so long as the true universals upon which all 
syllogistic conclusions depend are wanted will the 
science of syllogism combat with nearly equal force 
in favour of truth or falsehood to establish these 
is the office of philosophy and was the aim of aris 
totle in his treatise on the categories of which 
we have already shewn the relations and dependence 
in another place the analytical table of which 
with our synoptic table may serve as illustrations of 
the prosyllogism in extended forms 

 syllogisms are not only divided into the 
ree figures and their many modes j and into per

also distinguished as categorical hypothetical and 
disjunctive they are yet more eminently distin 
guished as affirmative and negative t between which 

 aristolle admits only three figures galen added a fourth

is the relative which suhdivide into particular and 
universal to which for completeness should he 
added the general which three latter are denoted 
by the articles or signs on somsf all there are 
yet other distinctions into all which we need not 
enter since it is of practical reference only and 
amply unfolded in the organon of aristotle 
and the works of other logicians 

 we have thus indicated the general and 
distinct nature of the syllogism and rapidly trod

who treats first of terms in his treatise on the 
categories — then of propositions enunciations 
or judgments in his book of interpretations — 
and thirdly of syllogisms in his analytics to 
which we refer 

 yet the synthetical plan however neces 
sary and well suited to the design of aristotle as a 
practical discipline is always obscure in point of 
doctrine and though it may conduct upon solid 
ground it leads us notwithstanding in the dark 
analysis on the contrary encompasses and en 

 the terms particular general and universal have been 
strangely confounded particular which properly expresses an 
individual part having been employed to denote also a general 
or comprehending nature and the term general properly sig 
nifying a united plurality or that which comprehends several or 
many particulars or individuals having been used to express 
illcomprehendingnessf or universality which again has been 
employed to express any general unity — a corruption to which 
these terms have been subject in common with other corre

syllogism 

lightens its whole subject and is the true doctrinal 
method 

 as universals can alone be proved ana 
logically for universal by induction is impractic 
able if not impossible and it cannot be concluded 
syllogistically and as particulars belong to gene 
rcuogism or induction syllogism lies between the 
other two modes in equal dependence upon them 
accordingly the validity of the foregoing syllogisms 
depends upon an ultimate analogism proving the 
major — that all men are fallible and an induc 
tion proving the minor — that philosophers are 
men and if such basis is wanted to either the 
conclusion falls of course 

 the propositions of which the syllogism 
is composed partake of the same relations depend 
ing equally upon induction or experience and 
analogism or reason but aristotle regarding syl 
logism and induction as opposites in ratiocination 
overlooked the analogism as the extreme opposed to 
induction and syllogism as their mean see his 
 prior analytics 

 now there are three degrees of convic 
tion or mental satisfaction through possibility 
 probability and necessity or certainty the 

 men are fallible inasmuch as they are capable of pro 
ceeding contrarily to the true reasons or relations of things 
they would otherwise be infallible the predicate fallibility 
belongs therefore to the universal predicament or category 
relation which is proved by analogism

 syllogism 

first and last of which are extremes without remis 
sion and the second is their mean of which the 
degrees are indefinite a thing is possible or it 
is nothing and that which we call necessary is 
irrefragably so or it is null 

 the syllogism then as a mode of ratio 
cination depending on premises which require proof 
appears even when most perfect to fall short of 
necessity or certainty while it proves in general 
beyond mere possibility its evidence lies there 
fore in the various degrees of probability between 
the extremes of possibility and certainty 

 to the foregoing rules of illation or 
logical conclusion may be added the following 
which coincide in the same universal reason and 
application although adduced principally in regard 
to the syllogism 

 no term or signification can be more ex 
tensive in the conclusion than in the premis 

 two things or propositions compared which 
agree with a third agree also with and may be 
affirmed of each other 

 two things or propositions of which one 
agrees and the other disagrees with a third will 
disagree with and may be denied of each other 

 nothing can be inferred or concluded from 
two negative terms or propositions 

 there can be no agreement of things com 
pared but through analogy

are those for the formation of syllogisms in figure 
and mode which though held of much importance 
are resolvable into the rule of analogy whereby 
the particular is contained in the general and 
both are included in the universal whence the 
particular inferred in the conclusion must be con 
tained in one premis and shewn to be so contained 
by the other and both the proof and compu

 syllogism 

istence or being which is cognised by reason as 
relation that we will subjoin an abstract of his 
doctrine 

 the notion of being or existence is of 
all the most universal the simplest and most 
deeply rooted in man whence it is evident that 
the conjunction of signification or terrns or union 
of apprehension by the means of being is in truth 
an identification of them for unity being a nega 
tion of multiplicity it follows that what is one is 
the same and this identification is truly and 
naturally expressed by saying that the one is the 
othert 

 the most complete knowledge we can 
have of anything is of such propositions as in 
the schools are called identical as if one should 
say john is john or a man is a man in these 
we may observe that evidence of truth arises out 
ofthe plain identification of the extremes that are 

affirmed of each other 

 • this identification is in fact the prin 
ciple of arithmetic the most strictly logical of the 
sciences whence conversely logic is intellectual 
computation a science of calculation or summing 
according to rules thus when by addition or 
multiplication we assert that iunce one is two 
we have but proposed the logical identity that two 
is two by a universal affirmation and when by

substraction or diyision we separate these ex 
tremes we have done the same arithmetically and 
logically by universal negation thus logical 
certainty is a true calculation of which the prin 
ciple is the analogy relation or identity here 
denoted 

 now affirmative propositions do by their 
form import an identification of their extremes 
for they all agree in saying the one is the other 
or this is that yet they are not all alike in the 
evidence of their identification for in some it 
shews itself pliainly without needing help as in 
all truisms and such identical sayings we just 
now gave for examples others require a course 
or discourse somewhat further about to prove the 
analogy or identification of their extremes 

 now the scope of such discovrsey or 
argument is to compare such propositions to some 
third thing with which each of them apart is iden 
tified since those which agree with the same thing 
must also agree with each other 

 when identity between two or more 
things presents itself to our understanding it 
produces knowledge or acknowledgment in the 
mind whence it is manifest that the same power 
or mind which in a single apprehension or term 
is possessed with the entity or unity of it is that 
very power or mind which applied to an enuncia 
tion or proposition knows acknowledges deems 
or understands since knowing is nothing else but

 syllogism 

the recognising or apprehending of manifest identity 
or correlation in the extremes of a proposition 

 the natural perfection of the mind or 
understanding is to be fraught with the whole uni 
verse that is to have the knowledge of all things 
that are agreeably to the platonic dogma that 
the mind knows all things virtually truth re 
siding only in the assents and judgments of the 
mind wherewith it enriches itself with the rest of 
the world and these being framed by the dis 
covering of an identity between two things which 
is expressed by affirming one of them of the other 
it follows that nothing can be true or false but 
where there is a composition of two extremes 
made by ones being affirmed of the other which 
is done only in enunciations or judgments while 
single apprehensions assert nothing and therefore 
settle no knowledge or relation in the mind 

 having shewn how two apprehensions 
joined together make a judgment the next thing 
will be to shew how three of those thoughts or 
judgments well chosen and duly ordered compose 
the most simple of perfect arguments which logi 
cians call a syllogism whose end and effect is to 
gain the knowledge of some relation before hidden 
and unknown 

 the copula or apprehension of union and relation is not 
enumerated here because it is alike in all propositions the three 
terms or apprehensions are nevertheless essential members of 
every proposition or judgment

syllogism 

 the means whereby this is accompbshed 
is as follows by the two first judgments we join 
the extremes of the proposition we desire to know 
to some third thing and then by observing that 
they are both one third thing and that one can be 
but one we come to discover that truly one of 
them is the other so that the identity which first 
made an identical proposition to be known and 
acknowledged and afterwards caused the like 
assent to those propositions whose identification 
was immediately apparent now by a short circuit 
and bringing in of a third term or medium makes 
the two first — the identification of which was ob 
scure and hidden while we looked upon the terms 
themselves — appear to be truly but one thing or 
relation 

 the variously combining and disposing of 
these three terms in the two first propositions beget 
a variety in the syllogisms that are composed of 
them which consists in this — that the assumed 
third term to which the other two are interchange 
ably joined is either said of them or they are said 
of it or it is said of one of them and the other is 
said of it 

 neither is there any deeper mystery than 
this in the three figures so much talked of by logi 
cians which being brought into rules to help the 
memory in the ready use of this transposition of 
terms if we spin our thoughts thereon into ever

so fine threads and thereof weave too intricate 
webs without reflecting on the solid ground and 
relations within ourselves whereon these rules are 
built we may spend our time in trivial and useless 
subtilties and at length confound and misapply 
our natural reason with a multitude of precepts 
drawn from artificial logic 

 under this primary threefold variety is 
another of greater extent growing out of the va 
rious combinations of the three terms as they are 
qualified by affirmation or negation and by uni 
versality or particularity for that unity which the 
two terms whose identification is inquired after 
must have by being joined with the third becomes 
much varied by such applications this affirm 
ation and negation of syllogisms resolves into the 
maxim mentioned by cicero according to whom 
the ancient logicians established that in all pro 
positions wherein yes or no is required one of 
them must be true which democritus attempted 
stupidly to answer by denying the necessity of these 
terms 

 from hence arises that multitude of kinds 
of syllogisms which logicians call modes all of which 
we have thus particularly expressed that we may 
observe how this great variety depends upon the 
sole principle of identity and entity or to express 
the same thing in other words upon universal

 as analogism is the form of ratiocination 
principally applicable to the intellectual sciences 
and universals as the generalogism is in like 
manner to the material sciences and particulars 
 is syllogism the form principally applicable to 
the mathematics and the sensible sciences and 
partakes of their intermediate relation the first 
of these forms belongs to the category of relation 
the second to that of quality and the last to that 
of quantity and since quantity and quality are 
relations analogism comprehends syllogism and 
generalogism fundamentally 

 syllogism is not however the sole mode 
or form of quantitative and mathematical reasoning 
but only its principal organ since we find examples 
of the other modes therein accordingly the first 
principles of all the pure mathematical sciences are 
proved analogically as are also harmonics and pro 
portionals generalogism is also of frequent occur 
rence in mathematical questions or the two latter 
modes may be compounded nor do we need any 
example to prove that the syllogism does not be

respect it coincides with the other modes 

 some indeed found logic altogether upon 
the mathematics and call it the science of ratio 
c but in truth the mathematical disciplines draw 
their accuracy and are deducible rather from ratio 
or reason and an accurate logic applied to the 
homogeneous relations of quantity 

 the mathematician defines his terms — 
establishes universal axioms and postulates which 
are the categories of the mathematician — con 
structs theorems and problems or theoretical and 
practical propositions — and finally demonstrates 
sylhgistically all of which is exactly according to 
the scholastic or aristotelian logic 

 the clear light and truth of mathematical 
reasoning depends upon the homogeneity of its 
matter and the correctness of its premises and 
other sciences are capable of the same precision 
in proportion as they are divested of the hetero 
geneous while the mathematics themselves lose 
their cogency when applied to subjects unconnected 
with or remote from the category of quantity to 
which they belong barrow has demonstrated this 
affinity of logic and the mathesis with a masterly

cination so that there arises a real discordance 
with a seeming agreement between the premises 
and the conclusion of which men either take ad 
vantage designedly or are thereby betrayed into 
sophisms 

 it has been shewn that the syllogism is a 
mode and process intermediate to and dependent 
on analogism and generalogism as extremes and 
that the analogism is the mode of intellectual and 
ethical science as the generalogism or induction 
is of material and physical science to which the 
sensible or esthetical science is intermediate it 
may therefore be asked if syllogism is the mode 
of esthetical science 

 we reply that as induction or generalo 
gism supplies the evidence and demonstration of 
physical and material things and analogism does 
the same of ethical and intellectual things accord 
ing to our analogy the evidence and demonstra 
tion of esthetical things are sensible and that in 
matters peculiar to sense sensation must ultimately 
determine 

 thus colours admit only of ocular demon 
stration the relations of sounds require auricular 
demonstration and in all matters of sense feeling 
must demonstrate and determine according to its 
own laws and relations there is hence a logic of 
sense or esthesis which has its own universal 
and specific organs laws and regulations syl

chapter ii 

generalogism or induction 

sect i 

introduction 

 it has happened naturally in the various 
progress of knowledge that philosophy has taken 
the lead and that the sister science of logic has 
generally received little countenance from philo 
sophers while it has heen scorned by the rest of 
mankind not indeed that it could be altogether 
dispensed with by either but being used as an 
instrument it has not been valued for itself or 
being austere and erroneous it has lain in dis 
repute while philosophy unsupported by a correct 
logic or misled by a false mode has run into error 
and confusion 

 among the many circumstances and ob 
jections which have arrested the progress of logic 
may be enumerated its apparent unprofitableness 
since it supplies little positive knowledge — that it 
may be regarded as needless since reasoning is a 
thing which lies so close to the nature of man that

he seems to possess it as a faculty without art — 
that it is not to be trusted because it has been 
more employed to confound and fetter than to 
enlighten and free the understanding — more for the 
purposes of falsehood than of truth — and above 
all that its difficulties as a science its few honours 
and its many failures have deterred adventurers 
so that for every single system of logic promul 
gated the world has received a hundred in philo 
sophy nevertheless the improvers of logic are 
among the greatest benefactors of mankind since 
by rendering men more reasonable they render 
them more able just and happy 

 without logical regulation men are during 
onehalf of their lives slaves to their passions and 
during the other half to their prejudices mistaking 
license for liberty or subjection for law j from 
which obliquities of youth and age reason alone 
can release them hence the man who is subju 
gated by his senses cannot be much better than a 
beast nor he who is governed by his prejudices 
become much superior to a fool — alas for him 
who is enslaved bv both 

 men have deemed it necessary to the due 
exercise of their inferior faculties to educate or cul 
tivate them but by a strange anomaly they have 
come even to despise logic the tutor and trainer 
of reason and put the selfsufficiency of the faculty 
in its place the whole mistake does not how 
ever lie with reason but partly with the imper

induction 

feetiod of logic exemplified as it has been in 
treatises better qualified to entangle than to release 
reason rendering it doubly incumbent on logicians 
to repair or reproduce the instruments of a sound 
logic 

 those who assert the sufficiency of na 
tural logic know also that men can walk and leap 
naturally although not without practice but they 
cannot march as soldiers nor dance artificially nor 
anyhow move gracefully or orderly in community 
without regulation and discipline and so it is in 
precise analogy with the use practice and disci 
pline of natural and artificial reasoning in respect to 
science and art whence the difierence between 
a disciplined army or rational assembly and a mob 
or a rout — or that between skilful sword and rifle 
men and combatants with sticks and stones is not 
greater than that between the untaught reasoner 
and the wellqualified logician there are how 
ever vicious extremes in all things and in logic 
he who totally disregards its art and discipline and 
he who uses it only for parade and triumph are 
equally in mistake and error and so it is through 
out science 

 although logic can neither furnish a man 
with faculties nor alone store the mind with infor 
mation it gives power and value by regulation to 
both and is the touchstone of science and truth 
nor is a valuable instrument to be rejected because 
it may have been unworthily or mischievously

employed and if logic for these reasons has of 
all sciences been the least cultivated and the most 
abused it is nevertheless of the first importance 
and the more calls for support since the fidelity of 
inference the force of conviction and the legiti 
macy of every conclusion depend upon an accu 
rate logic it is therefore indispensable not 
only throughout all science but in all the great 
afiairs of life nor ought the chief of all disci 
plinesy and that which lies at the root of all 
intellectual culture to be deemed itself unworthy 
of cultivation 

 it must be admitted nevertheless that 
literature without excepting even the great works 
of aristotle and bacon has not hitherto produced a 
work deserving the title of a universal logic since 
syllogism is for the most part strictly conclusive 
only in the homogeneous relations of mathematical 
quantity and fails almost entirely or altogether in 
physics and ethics while the logic of induction 
or oeneralogisnij however useful in natural philo 
sophy and the common affairs of life or however 
necessary in judicial investigations is unfruitful in 
pure ethics and the mathematics 

 it is at the bar and in the senate that 
this latter form of argument has been chiefly and 
necessarily resorted to owing to the very hetero 
geneous nature of judicial evidence and affairs of 
state but it was considered as too loose and in 
conclusive for the stricter purposes of science till

bacon influenced by the bent and practice of his 
profession the habit of which he had carried with 
hito into retirement judiciously and with discrimi 
nate sagacity introduced the logic of the courts 
into physics hoping thereby to build up the whole 
of philosophy physiologically upon the legal ground 
of a solid universal induction 

 to induction accordingly we are in 
debted for an important reform in the study of 
nature or physics and for the means of adding 
greatly to the natural knowledge numbers and 
corporeal comforts of mankind it has notwith 
standing been either useless or injurious in morals 
wherein induction is of no theoretical and of little 
other practical use than to teach us how to coun 
teract the fraud of others and become ourselves 
expediently honest while by placing conviction on 
experience and multiplying objects of power plea 
sure and contention it loosens the bonds of society 
and robs man of reliance on religion 

 and although induction brought reform 
into physics it did little for universal philosophy 
and as little toward universal logic the judicial 
bent of lord bacons mind and his habits were 
unfavourable to an entire logical system by giving 
his judgment a bias from the uniform relations

thus succeeded in physics and particulars it has 
from want of generic principles effected nothing in 
suhjects of taste or esthetics and has failed alto 
gether in ethics except in the practical judgments 
in law and legal equity by skilfully unfolding 
the disguise in which cases are clothed with cir 
cumstances a skill more dependent on experience 
than reason in fact therefore the remark made 
by the great harvey who was bacons physician 
that he wrote philosophy like a lord chan 
cellor may be extended also to his logic yet 
dr willis has justly observed that had bacon 
written his novum organum from harveys 
work as a text he would scarcely have expressed 
himself otherwise than he has donet nor can a 
better example of bacons inductive process be 
cited than that of harvey on the motion of the 
heart and blood in animals nevertheless harvey 
did not confine his logic to induction but em 
ployed the analogism with admirable taste and 
skill in his more abstruse inquiries 

 thus while modem philosophers by the 
aid and example of the great verulam have cor 
rected the errors by which the ancients founded 
physics upon a basis entirely speculative and have 
thereby wrought a great and obvious reform in

induction 

every department of natural philosophy they have 
themselves erred equally and with an influence 
infinitely more mischievous hy consigning moral 
and intellectual science to induction so that 
should a check not he put to its course there is 
danger that empiricism may usurp the dominion of 
mind 

 this impulse of induction was undoubt 
edly determined by the abuse of the syllogistic 
process during the middle ages and the absurd 
contentions of polemics properly enough termed 
wrangling in which the strength of argument was 
made to consist in resistance of evidence and a 
fruitless logomachy and also by the vain attempts 
of philosophers to establish the speculative as well 
as the experimental sciences upon syllogism the 
force of which lies principally in words and a 
connexion with philological science 

 yet has the logic of induction coupled 
with a tasteless rhetoric been hardly less abused 
in the courts of law and in politics than was that 
of the syllogism in the schools in both of which 
natural reason has been subjected to artifices more 
successfully employed in defending falsehood than 
in disclosing truth 

 it is apparent therefore that in the most 
important concerns of moral and intellectual science 
neither of the established organs suffice and that 
they leave man without an authority for his judg 
ment therein or a rational guide for his conscience

undoubtedly one of the greatest efforts of human 
intellect is not free from this error his genius 
and subtilty are unquestionable but his readers 
require the powers and acuteness of the master to 
penetrate the mighty maze of thought into which 
his developcments conduct without having clearly 
demonstrated their foundation nor are we aware 
that any near approach has been made toward so 
desirable an end by either or all of the twelve 
thousand commentaries which patricius computes 
to have been written upon that work at the close 
of the sixteenth century — a fact alone sufficient to 
prove its insufficiency no less than the interest and 
importance of the question 

 bacon too following his great prototype 
in his novum organum has led us into intri 
cacies without having well established the ground 
work of his method it has proved too often an 
impediment to the progress of science when ex 
tensive works have been established by eminent 
men prematurely upon partial and imperfect 
foundations for such have been made standards 
to all future accomplishments to question the au 
thority of which or to seek science upon other 
ground has been stigmatised as unpardonable 
heresy nor has it happened in such cases till 
error has propagated itself into absurdity that 
reforms have been accepted and such has been

q generalogism or 

bacon ran his logic into divisions and distinc 
tions as intricate and numerous as those of the 
great organon but his distribution was not so 
complete and exhaustive as that of the stagjrite 
the simplest forms and regulations are however of 
most importance in logic for understanding and 
practice and the diffusion and complication of 
cases can only be of puerile use for exercise and 
discipline for logic being of boundless grasp and 
diversity is especially obnoxious to confusion 

 bacon having treated of induction in his 
 novum organum independently of the syllo 
gistic method may have led to the opinion that he 
opposed these modes with intention to supplant the 
latter and that he did not bring induction in aid 
of the common logic nevertheless his design 
appears even from his title to have been princi 
pally to introduce a new hand or instrument which 
he meant had he lived to finish and attach to the 
body of logic whence the works of these great 
men are properly to be regarded as parts of a 
whole 

 plato the master of aristotle employed 
the logic of induction morally and metaphysically 
on behalf of intellectual images — ijga or ideas — 
as bacon employed the same instrument on behalf 
oi physical forms and although neither of these 
philosophers succeeded in establishing either their 
ideas or forms which have nearly the same signi 
fication both representing intellectual objects yet

induction 

has the logic of induction proved infinitely more 
efficient from the hand of bacon in physics than 
from that of plato in metaphysics because it is the 
irvie physical organ 

 aristotle who saw this insufficiency of 
platos dialectic attempted to remedy it for all 
science by an instrument of his own and substi 
tuted his syllogistic logic as a universal organ 
but which is in strictness of reference unsuited 

•both to physics and metaphysics and properly 
belongs to the mathematical disciplines wherein it 
originated nor did ramus succeed any better in 
his attempt to connect the dialectic of plato with 
the logic of aristotle 

 attempts have been made to extend the 
forms of bacon and to restore the ideas of plato 
as keys to intellectual knowledge but without suc 
cess and logic is still deficient of an appropriate 
intellectual organ since the many modem attempts 
to found moral and metaphysical sciences and dis 
ciplines on induction have also failed 

 yet cannot logic whatever its failures or 
misappliances be dispensed with nor cease to in 
fluence mankind for reasoning is as natural to the 
mind as exercise is to the body and since thought 
governs action by some kind of logic must the 
practices of men be ever prompted and as philo

vails has turned the mind downwards and freed it 
even to licentiousness we may reasonably expect a 
beneficial change if it should be hereafter in the 
power of another organ to give a new direction and 
regulation to the mind 

 every art and science requires adaptation 
to the state and progress of the human mind and 
to this we owe the changes of logic both antient 
and modem and although precedence in syllo 
gistic logic must be conceded to aristotle and 
that of the generalogical or inductive logic to 
bacon for by them they were distinctly established 
yet the first borrowed syllogism from the rhetori 
cians and mathematicians and the inductive pro 
cess was not exclusively the discovery of the latter 
his ancestor friar bacon is even supposed to have 
laid the foundation of his attempt in his opils 
majus socrates however according to his dis 
ciple plato whose dialogues afford still the 
best examples of the generalogical process though 
misapplied appears to have been the first and 
greatest master of the mode nor was it unknown 
or unnoticed by aristotle but the induction of 
bacon differed from that of socrates and chiefly in 
this that bacon adapted it to the discovery of 
physical truths and socrates applied it to the 
confutation of moral errors 

 but it detracts nothing from the reputa 
tion of bacon and aristotle to affirm that neither

the one was the discoverer of induction nor the 
other of syllogism hoth of which belong to the 
mind for nothing true is new but eternal and 
to this imputation all inventors are obnoxious and 
to the great verulam was reserved that application 
of induction which has been so effective in the 
physical sciences and of such practical advantages 
in the utilities of life that the epoch of logic and 
philosophy as modem will be assigned to him and 
his time by true historians 

 bacon was perhaps led to adopt this mode 
as much by his judicial habits in which induction 
as the logic of legal evidence and circumstances 
is indispensable as he was by the bent of his 
genius j and although it is known that he left his 
great work the novum organvm unfinished

aristotelian logic hroke up and frittered every 
suhject of human science into trivial distinctions

conian logic has done enough to shew clearly that 
the progress of philosophy is dependent on and 
coincident with that of logic and the logic of 
induction which is oenerahgical aims at carrying 
up individuals to species and species to oenera 
although it accomplishes these empirically and im 
perfectly 

 but for the complete progress of human 
knowledge and attainments a universal organ is 
still necessary and the only other is analogism 
which developes the mind universally and if such 
organ has not yet found a place in logical science 
it may have been from the narrowness and vagueness 
of philosophic conception embracing no complete 
universality and few correlative lofty generalities 
or from the infinitude of reason and diversity of 
its methods and objects but more than all from 
the arbitrary looseness and range of thought 
throughout the universe whereby imagination 
usurps the dominion of reason and philosophy to 
which all logic is accountable 

 evidence is the matter of logic and of 
logical evidence there are two distinct kinds — the 
evidence of reason and understanding which is

in their proper elements the one cannot interfere or

the philological with regard to signs and the 
senses — and the noological with regard to reason 
and the understanding to which latter the modes 
of logic have been mostly confined to these may 
be added the indirect evidence of testimony in both 
respects 

 the logic of reason being dependent on 
perfect relations is certain or conclusive and deter 
mines perfectly the logic of experience being 
dependent on affections which vaiy with the or 
gans of sense is uncertain or indicative but as 
they coincide and concur in general experience is 
amenable to reason as human testimony is also 
to both reason and experience 

 • the forms of logic are organs which 
are each applicable to the various kinds of matter 
or evidence so that we may syllogise generalo 
giscj or anahgise concerning either the evidence 
of experience or of reason or of that which is 
composed of both viz the mathematical 

 yet as the evidence of sense is that of 
individuals and particulars in relation the form of 
logic best adapted thereto is that which investi 
gates particulars and such is the oeneralogism or 
the inductive form and the evidence of reason 
is that of universals to which the analogical form

is appropriate and its investigations are those of 
universal relations while the evidence composed 
of reason and sense a priori and a posteriori as 
is the mathematical has an appropriate organ of 
investigation and determination in the syuogism 
which identifies particulars with universals and is 
rational demonstration through general media 

s the application of the latter form or 
the syllogistic organ to the investigation of either 
universal or individual matters argues illegi 
timately according to evidence and afibrds no 
certain conviction or conclusion yet says 
harvey some weak and inexperienced persons 
vainly seek by dialectics and farfetched argu 
ments either to upset or establish things that are 
only to be founded on anatomical demonstration 
and believed on the evidence of the senses he 
truly desires to be informed of the question in 
hand and whether the facts alleged be sensible 
visible or not must be held bound either to look for 
himself or to take on trust the conclusions to which 
they have come who have looked and indeed there 
is no higher method of attaining to assurance and 
certainty by what reasoning should we give the 
blind from birth to know that the sun was luminous 
and so it is with the circulation of the blood 
which the world has now had before it for so many

 there are also in a philosophical respect 
three kinds of logical evidence in reference 
to the external there are facts and existences 
 in reference to the internal there are reasons 
and convictions and in reference to the me 
dial there are sensations and feelings and these 
are conformable with the three modes of logic and 
when perfect are all indisputable for of facts and 
sensations there can be no question of reason and 
against perfect reasons there is no fact or sensa 
tion nor finally has sense any right to dispute 
either pure reason or fact 

 all proof or evidence is ultimately intel 
lectual and the difference in its distinctions as 
moral logical and physical consists in their 
sources the last of these being from existence 
through experience the first from relation through 
consciousness and the intermediate or logical 
proof is from the understanding through cognition 
or thought now as all cognition is we have 
seen a unifying process varying in the production 
of particular general or universal unities the 
proof of anything consists in including or bringing 
it under some general or universal and this rule 
holds in the oeneralogism as in each of the previous 
processes

ratios as these are reducible to metaphysical or 
logical reasons but it does not follow that all

by common sense although each is of sufficient 
reason on its own ground the base of the first

that of the third intellectual whence it follows 
that facts and ratios are subjects of reason and 
not legislators to reason and that each has a 
distinctly appropriate logic — the first belonging 
to induction or indication by instances in general 
concurrence 

 all confidence in the general inferences of 
induction is founded on the uniformity whereby 
effects are invariable as their causes and both 
conformable to an eternal universal analogy of 
which none however ignorant doubt hence all 
mankind are determined thereby in all their 
acts and affairs even to a secondary reliance of 
men on men and things however arbitrary and 
conventional under similarity of circumstances 
altogether being based on an invariable original 
analogy 

 some of the finest illustrations and ex 
amples of this generalising logic are those induc

insurances c are constructed continually im

section il 
induction 

 the last of the three modes organs or 
forms of ratiocination is the generalogism or 
induction which is a colligation or generalising 
process from particulars and is the logic of instances 
and individuals and it argues synthetically from 
the particular or partial relations to the genera 
or general relations of things it is therefore the 
extreme mode of logical science opposed to the 
analogism which argues analytically from univer 
sal entire or perfect relations to species and parti 
cular relations we have just before shewn that 
the syuogism lies between them as a middle mode 

 the simple generalogism argues from a 
single instance or individual to a particular a 
general or a universal for example

induction 

weakest of all legitimate arguments not at all 
allowable in the other modes but very common in 
colloquial practice though rather rhetorical than 
logical since its evidence does not amount to pro 
bability but demonstrates possibility only it is 
strengthened in proportion as we increase or add to 
the number of its analogous instances or examples 
as it is also by extending its relations and it 
then becomes a compound generalogism or aggre 
gate induction the strength of which lies also in 
the extent and number of its related instances 
and the paucity of its opposite or negating in 
duction 

 the positive or affirmative logical prin 
ciple of induction founded on the uniform rela 
tions of nature is that whatever holds for true 
in any and many instances holds also for true in 
every and all similar instances and the negative 
or exceptional principle is that of dissimilarity of 
instances so that in fact the induction is but an 
assertion or ascertaining of analogy between its 
members and if the case should involve both these 
positive and negative principles the determination 
of such analogy will be according to the prepon 
derance of agreement or disagreement of either the 
affirmative or negative instances and these prin 
ciples are in accordance with those of the syllogism 
de omni et de nuuo which we have shewn also 
to be rules of analogy 

 god is real but with man all other reality

 generalogism or 

is reality of relation only t e of analog hence 
all logical demonstration terminates in reality of 
relation ie analogy and both are dependent on 
universality of relation or unity the general 
relations of nature are but the included parts of 
this universality and in demonstrating them from 
the partial and particular realities of nature 
through inductions we do but disclose this ana 
logy as we establish also general rules 

 in every induction unless there be a real 
relation or analogy throughout its members there 
can be no inference even of probability much less 
of certainty yet it is as common as it is fallacious 
to build arguments on mere mental associations of 
things ideas or even of prejudices and to regard 
them as effects of causes although if such asso 
ciations were real relations they would amount only 
to the induction of a particular 

 thus men superstitiously infer good or ill 
fortune from certain days c on or with which 
they may have experienced either or they attribute 
worth ability or the want of them to anothers 
success or failure in a single instance or as they 
infer that the weather and tides are caused by 
the moon because their motions coincide — that the 
doctor cured the disease because the patient re 
covered—or that he died absolved or with a good 
or ill conscience because he departed with or 
without fear and trembling in all such cases at 
tributing cause to concomitance although there be

no real relation or analogy therein to justify the 
inferences 

 it is then a rule of logical induction 
that it should include analogous or similar parti 
culars i e similarity of instances under a ge 
nerality induced or deduced but in inductive 
descriptions of any whole of which the particulars 
it includes are dissimilar such whole is not ge 
neral but a principal particular whence no induc 
tion or generalogism ensues but only a synthesis 
or analysis of a whole or an enumeration of parts 
this rule applies equally to the most complex and 
most simple subjects the sole condition being that 
the instances adduced however dissimilar must 
concur as particulars in the general inference 

 thus for example of a complex subject 
men talk of civilisation as they do of truths sup 
posing every one to have a definite understanding 
of the thing or idea signified although it is a very 
proteus and to be generally defined only by a vast 
induction wherein if it be assumed from acknow 
ledged instances that civilisation is tlie sway of 
intellect this will appear in forms and shapes in 
numerable thus intellect exercising moral reason 
in the abolition of slavery civilises humanity if 
absurd rites and unjust ordinances in religion or 
politics are abolished it is by the operation of 
reason and the sway of intellect and civilisation

one hand and on the other in deducing generals 
or unitiesj from the varieties of particulars and 
this is the twofold office of the generalogism 

 there are then two species of the gene 
ralogism the materials of both which are parti 
culars by the first we class or arrange particulars 
under a general terrn and generals under the more 
general and universal and by the latter we 
gather that which is general among a variety of 
particulars and ultimately that which is universal 
from generals 

 the first is properly an induction or pre 
dication of species and genus and determines the 
rank or class of particulars with regard to each 
other and to universal being and the latter a 
deduction thereof and determines the most general 
or universal relation predicate attribute or form 
of a class of particulars the one terminates in the 
category of existence the other in that of relation 
under which all knowledge is comprehended 

 thus universal oeneral special and 
individicaly are terms expressing logical relation 
and subordination whereby the chief premises x 
the analogism are universal those of the gene

vegetal mineral under the most general term 
matter finally we collect the superior genera 
matter sense and intelligence under the su

 thus we induce or determine the rank 
or class of the subject particulars or individuals 
charles c with respect to universal existence 
by arranging them under the general natures or 
terms human animal material and this we call 
an induction of the matter or subject and though 
by a series of generalogisms we thus connect the

the great verulam founded his novum or

 so much with respect to the generalogism

bacon who confessedly delivered it imperfectly we 
will endeavour for the sake of research to retrace 
it in another view

 the world around us consists then we 
repeat of a universal variety of particulars and 
generals and this variety philosophically viewed 
is either essences or relations or logically and 
philologically it is a variety of subjects or pre 
dicates or physiologically or physically of suh 
stances and qualities or properties c and of 
these the signification is the same under different 
views we have already considered the genera 
logism in a logical view but as this mode is prin 
cipally applicable to physics we will also regard it 
physically 

 as the term particular or individual 
physically and logically like its correlations general 
and universal signifies a unity it must be a unity

ofpartsy or an integer there is therefore nothing 
in the universe absolutely particular or singular 
and accordingly enery particular sensible things or 
subject consists of an assemblage of qualities or 
attributes and evert quality exists variously in a 
variety of subjects or things and this accords 
equally with reason and experience 

 the particulars or premises of a genera 
logism may therefore be collected analytically as 
well as synthetically and it follows from the above 
that by the analytical process we either seek all 
the attributes or qualities of a subject or substance 
as for example of gold or we seek all the sub 
jects or substances of a quality or attribute as for 
example of heat and from these we deduce the 
general nature of a subject or substance or of an 
attribute or quality the first of which may be 
called a generalogism of the mattery the other a 
generalogim of the form and thus the generalo 
gism takes the same distinctions physically as logi 
cally of the synthetical process we have already 
given brief examples 

 as the particulars of the world may be 
regarded first as essences subjects or substances 
c or secondly as relations predicates or qua 
lities c according to the category under which 
they are viewed the distinctions of subject and 
predicate are reciprocally convertible or inter 
changeable both with respect to the syllogism and 
generalogism we may therefore generalogise of

or synthetically as for example of heat 

 the terms particular general and uni

that partakes not of a general or manifold nature 
neither is there any general that may not be re 
garded as particular hence any general or 
aggregate may by the analytical process just men 
tioned become the matter or premiss of a gene 
ralogism the same also holds with respect to 
universals the generalogism is therefore a uni 
versal and infinite process 

 as the synthetical process ascends to the 
genus or to that in which particulars unite or 
agree so the analytical process descends to the 
subordinate agreements and specific differences of 
particulars thus the variety of particulars john

elm yew rose c nitre iron clay c 
agreeing under the term material substances differ 
under those of animal vegetal and mineral

folded by analysis become tbe matter of tbe 
generalogism before mentioned 

 in every species or form of the genera 
logism — and it is that which distinguishes it from 
the other logical modes — there is first a collection 
of various particulars by synthesis or analysis 
and secondly a disclosure of a generality or 
agreement among them to generalogise is there 
fore to generalise and this may be done affirma 
tively or negatively by collecting or rejecting of 
instances and particulars till the general or uni 
versal term or proposition is confirmed 

 in fact the induction rests upon the 
analogy of nature by which we recognise its uni 
formity and constancy and conclude from causes 
to effects inferring from similarity or analogy of 
causes to similarity or analogy of effect c so 
that in strictness the analogical process is at the 
foundation of all logic 



section v 

 when by analysis of a general or uni 
versal the oeneralogism seeks the agreements and 
differences of things it verges upon the analogism 
so in particularising we have remarked that the 
latter mode verged upon the former synthetically 
at the same time these two processes concur in the

 oeneralooism or 

syllogism antithetically these three modes there 
fore reciprocate and are also convertible 

 it is an essential distinction of the three 
forms of argument that the analogism concludes 
immediately the syllogism mediately or through 
a middle term and the generalogism through 
many medioj or particulars to universality 

 it is a further distinction of these forms 
that the categorical or perfect analogism con 
cludes and proves the whole amount of its premises 
the syllogism less than the amount of its premises 
while the conclusion of the generalogism compre 
hends in general more than its premises whence 
the fallacies of this latter mode 

 the logical axiom — that no more can he 
strictly inferred or concluded from any argument 
than is contained or included in its premises — holds 
good not only in the analogism and syllogism but 
also in the generalogism without universal in 
the premises therefore there can be no universal 
or perfect conclusion but this is generally im 
possible in the generalogism because particulars 
which constitute its matter or premises are infinite 
throughout nature in any case however in which 
all its particulars can be enumerated a perfect in 
ductive argument may be constructed as for ex 
ample in numbers agreeably to the axiom that the 
whole is equal to all its pirts 

 the fofce and extent of evidence in the 
generalogism is consequently proportionate to

induction 

the number of parts particulars or media it com 
prehends or contains and if this fall short of 
universality or totality its evidence however suf 
ficient it may be in general to satisfy inquiry 
amounts only to some high probability and not to 
certainty perfect cogency or necessity 

 the logical axiom according to which 
 things that are equal to the same third thing are 
equal to each other establishes also that the 
halves or other proportional parts of such equal 
things are also equal to each other and these 
inferences are universally true from demonstration 
of reason or relation without an induction of au 
the parts and particulars 

 the same is conclusive of all homogeneous 
particulars but induction of all the particulars 
of a subject is impossible in physical and sensible 
things which are therefore incapable of entire and 
absolute demonstration 

 induction forms collects and classes pro 
positions and things according to their specific or 
individual relations syllogism connects them ac 
cording to their generic or general relations and 
analogism discloses their chief or universal rela 
tions but inasmuch as the offices of each organ 
or process is the disclosing of relations varying 
only in degree they participate each others nature 
or reciprocate analogically at their foundation 

 it holds equally true in each of the three 
modes or forms of logic that there can he no con

is no arguing conclusively from one universal genus 
to another in the strict logical investigation of 
any subject it is then of chief importance to keep 
in mind that the premises and concltbsion micst be 
reciprocally homogeneous and that logic is modified 
by every subject 

s therefore essence and relation being 
the sole categories and the external medial 
and internal the universal genera of knowledge 
having each its appropriate evidence we cannot 
conclude logically from one to the other and as 
the evidence of the first of these three genera is 
matter of fact such as are the testimony of witness 
experience and history while the evidence of the 
second of these genera is sensations and that of the 
third is the pure and perfect relations qfreason we 
cannot conclude from the relative to the absolute 
nor the contrary nor from reasons to facts nor 
the contrary nor from either of these to sensa 
tions nor vice versd from either as however 
there is no absolute separation of the three genera 
each may be used in aid or illustration of lihe 
others although it will afford strict logical conclu 
sions on its own ground alone

pune truth and conviction are dependent upon 
sense — that in matters of fact and art they 
depend upon external testimony and experience or 
experiment and that finally in complex matters 
truth and conviction must be sought through a 
compound testimony with all possible attention to 
homogeneity and genuine analogy 

 we see hence why in common phrase 
 facts are stubborn things — why tastes are 
not to be disputed — which may be asserted of all 
feelings and affections also and why the conclusions 
of genuine reason are not to be resisted 

 were it otherwise conviction might be 
obtained through physical force which is the logic 
of power — the right of might — and adapted to 
the irrational only and to be employed only in 
those ofllces of authority in which reasoning would 
be either misplaced or absurd as in the disciplining 
of children the executing of laws or the com 
manding of armies which although they require 
to be founded on reason dispense with argument 
and give orders only in practice between these 
several cases there are however many media so 
much with regard to dialectics and respecting the 
first forms or operations of logic but logic is an 
infinite discipline and were we intent on an entire

 generalogism or induction 

 it is more essential in the first instance 
to repress the false hopes and pretensions of logic 
and science that time and powers may not be 
wasted in vain research for in vain do physio 
logists seek seminal principles through induction 
the great harvey failed in this attempt in vain 
do the chemists seek material elements by the 
same means wherein davy and our contemporaries 
will have also failed and in vain also do the 
metaphysicians in like manner generalogise in 
search of spiritual essences in which they must 
equally fail for in a system of universal cor 
relation there can be no first or absolute principle 
knowable 

 accordingly when by physical analysis 
solid matter has been resolved into liquid liquid 
into gas and gas into thereals their correlative 
positive and negative elements are finally forced 
into mind as active and passive principles imper 
ceptible by sense till reunited in electrical con 
currence thus the system of nature terminates 
in an ultimate analogism for by whatever pro 
cess nature is urged to a final extreme it is forced 
into mind the abode of first principles — the mind 
out of us — the analogon of all nature and of the 
mind within us — whence it follows that the whole 
of human nature sense and soul resolves into cor 
respondence with the great intellect and logos 
 in whom man lives moves and has his being

sq there remain for notice according to the 
custom of logicians somewhat concerning method 
as a mean for the discovery and promulgation of 
truth and science and somewhat concerning the 
sophutical arts and fallacies hy which logical 
truth is corrupted and perverted and first of 
method 

 since then our object is not the art and 
practice of logic but the science and plan we may 
briefly remark that method signifies a way or 
regulation according to relation and that our 
whole system aims at supplying the best possible 
method namely the analogy of nature in which 
every subject may be considered and treated with

it in its nearest and most prominent and ultimately 
in its remotest relations analyticauy and stnthe 
ucauy or antitheticalltf according to the subject 

 this brings us to the two divisions usually 
assigned by logicians to method namely the me 
thod of solution and distribution called aoalytical 
and the method of composition and aggregation 
called synthetical between and connecting which 
lies an antithetical method or method of comparison 
or analogy by which we systematise put in order 
and harmonise any subject 

 some obscurity of signification has how 
ever attended the two former distinctions ana 
lytical and synthetical a priori being the contrary 
or opposite of analytical and synthetical a posteriori 
so again physically analytical is the converse of 
morally or intellectually analytical the sense 
however in which we have employed these terms 
is that of the intellectual or d priori 

 the author of vindicise antiquse in 
quoting dr campbells philosophy of rhetoric 
has remarked that he appears to use the terms 
analysis and synthesis in a sense altogether un 
warranted by the analogies of the greek language 
aod unsanctioned by use analysis universally 
signifies in philosophic language the reduction of 
a whole to its component parts so that by its 
means we never can ascend from particulars to

universals and it is equally impossible to descend 
by synthesis from universals to particulars for 
synthesis always implies apposition and the for 
mation of one out of many such also is the 
modem sense in which these terms are employed 
by the chemists although frequently confounded 
in other subjects — and agreeably to this sense 
the argument d priori or from the mind to pheno 
mena or from the cause to its effects and that a 
posteriarif or frtm effects to their cause are identical 
with analysis and synthesis as thus distinguished 

 of these methods the analytical is the 
true doctrinal method applicable to science and 
philosophy of which the present work may be 
regarded as an example the synthetical method 
is disciplined and applicable to the disciplines and 
arts as st to that of philology which begin 
ning with letters proceeds to words and proposi 
tions dly to logic which beginning with words 
or terms proceeds to propositions and arguments 
and dly to the mathematics which beginning 
with terms and definitions proceeds upon axioms 
and postulates to propositions and demonstrations 
c the antithetical metlwd is technical at once 
theoretical and practical and applicable to all the 
arts the three methods are nevertheless efficient 
in each respect and hence they have been variously 
applied and confounded therein

divisions and distinctions under the head of me 
thod we shall however be brief and adduce only 
the most obvious and useful 

the three logical rules of division and the 
distribution of the whole are that the members 
shall exhaust the fvhole or that the division shall 
be entire that the members shall be correlated 
or opposed and that one member shall not 
contain or predicate another or that the divisions 
shall be distinct therefore for the divisions of any 
whole to become distinct in difference correlate in 
agreement and entire as a whole they must be 
distributed according to truth and relation analo 
gically 

 although distinctions in science as in 
nature are endless the multiplication of distinctions 
is no mark of science because all distinctions of 
genera and species are relative and there are no 
absolute divisions that is every individual how 
ever remote still holds relation to every prior species 
and genus whence the further we divide and distin 
guish the more we obscure and confound and the 
only true distinction between science and nescience 
consists in the perspicuity and perspicacity of know 
ledge by the former thus the first combinations of 
generic colours are clearly distinguishable species 
the secondary combinations are also distinguishable 
— after which the recombinations are distinct onlv 
to the disciplined eye and the end of the process is 
in all cases indistinguishableness if we reverse

 the whole of logic is the science of 
method distributable according to the logical ope 
rations into three kinds the generalogical syllo 
gistical and analogical which are nearly coinci 
dent with those we have enumerated as the methods 
of composition solution and cojnparison the 
latter of which is the analogical method and 
requires first that we define and analyse a subject 
to ascertain its various relations and then deter 
mine its antagonist extremes whence we may attain 
the true mean of inquiry 

 suppose for example the subject of in 
quiry to be the popular one of socialism which 
may be defined the association of men in families 
for a mutual object and having unfolded its va 
riety by analysis from the association of the den to 
that of the monastery including owenism of which 
forms we find the object on one extreme is fo esta 
blish sensual and social enjoyment at a maximum 
and to dispense with priests and religion and 
that its antagonistic or opposite extreme is mono 
chism the object of which is the utter mortifica 
tion of the sensual and social mn and entire 
devotion to religion and priestdom we may then 
more readily attain by comparison of their goods 
and evils — advantages and disadvantages — the true 
social mean and may fairly conclude that as men

ment it is salutary and expedient that they should 
cultivate and encourage in themselves and each 
other selfcontrol and communion with god but 
according to what method cannot safely be com 
mitted to either monks or modem socialists to

 other logical methods are the well 
known mode of stuogismf which proceeds by as 
sertion and media and the no less celebrated so 
cratic or interrogative method which we have 
already noticed as proceeding by question through 
induction to the end in view to these we would 
add the method of concession computing through 
analogism by conceding the antagonists position 
or positions and carrying them to extremes which 
involve the mean assumed in absurdity and in 
this way every false assumption worked out confutes 
itself 

 suppose for example that some politician 
shall assume the position that universal stiffrage 
is the constitutional right of the members of the 
community let it be conceded without distinction 
of sex and he will allow that women hare such 
rightf and either give up his position or grant that 
they ought also to vote if the latter concede it

method are especially applicable and although this 
title has been given to the induction the proper 
office of which is to generalise it is more com 
monly the opposite of induction by its seeking of 
particulars which is the office of the practical 
analogism this method is accordingly variously 
analytical synthetical or antithetical and is the 
most diffuse and practical of the whole and much 
dependent on experience and circumstances 

 when many circumstances are brought to 
bear upon one point or particular they are ad 
mitted to strengthen the proof thereof by a general 
agreement which is also called induction and the 
wider and more abundant such concurrence is the 
more powerful is the proof of the question consi

 an extraordinary concurrence of many 
circumstances can only happen from a breadth of 
relation coinclusive of all the circumstances and 
binding them in a logical identity that gives to the 
evidence a logical power beyond any human testi

trary to truth this is the historic method fa 
miliar to all men and dependent on memory as 
the poetical method using fictions does on ima 
gination and as the logical and philosophical does 
on reason 

 the principal object of the chronological 
method is to avoid anachronisms of facts but the 
anachronistns of reason are not less common than 
anachronisms of sense nor is it less offensive to 
truth and understanding to see effects placed before 
causes conclusions precede premises or any how 
the posterior before the prior than it is to see the 
course of facts and occurrences inverted the true 
succession of words thoughts and things is chro

other a relation of place internal or external

been called the fields and mansions of argument

the time of aristotle it properly belongs to philo

therefore we refer to philosophy of which logic 
is the counterpart 

 knowledge being a whole which compre 
hends the universe every part and subject of which 
being also variously related to all other parts the 
differences of subjects and things are differences 
of position and are so called whence arises the 
variety of topics and subjects throughout the uni 
verse of knowledge 

 hence every subject or position that be 
comes a universal question being partially treated 
must result in failure or fallacy — as has been ex 
emplified in most questions of controversy wherein 
polemics having run into confusion succeeding in 
quirers have discarded the simplicity of universality 
for the simplicity of particularity that of breadth 
for that of narrowness and thus the question of 
beauty has terminated in ascribing to an individual 
line or quality a relation that is universal and 
questions of even higher interest such as those 
of moral good and evil disinterestedness liberty 
c have fared no better 

 there is therefore a primary necessity 
for a true universal system to the perfecting of 
knowledge to which every topic and particular 
inquiry of man may have reference as a method 
and measure of its truth or logical validity and 
sufficiency and this nothing but universal philo

sophistry or fallacies 

are sources of false judgment often carried as prin 
ciples into argument sufficient to fill volumes and 
a history of prejudices alone would be a history of 
mankind 

 every folly every vice and every crime 
every error and mistake of men involves a logical 

fallacy and not unfirequently a regularlyconstructed 
sophism adapted to selfdeception or the deceiving 
of others the habit of excusemaking is a regular 
art of such false logic all orders and professions 
abound in such dehgy it is the demon of man 
kind to resolve all the fallacies of logic would 
be a greater task than those of hercules yet very 
much resembling the cleansing of the augean 
stables and as detestable an office to intellect but 
happily the progress of logical intelligence will in 
its course purify the mind from fallacies 

 all fallacies of the mind are logical and 
as the mind is engaged in every voluntary act and 
thought of men the boundlessness of the subject is 
apparent but it is a fertile one wherein logicians 
have delighted to revel and to which they have 
given needless attention and importance for as 
truth and fact and not fallacies are the proper 
light and object of logic wherein falsehood dis 
appears the research oi fallacies and extrication 
of errors are little better than explorings in dark 
ness 

 by this we mean no more than that the

laws of truth whereby fallacies become detected and 
resolved as light expels darkness or converts it 
into that oscuro which increases its brilliancy and 
also to excuse us from entering further into a 
negative inquiry than inveterate errors may have 
rendered expedient for the correction of logic or 
chiefly as a guard against its perversion 

 sophistry lies at the foundation of the 
faculties whence other principal errors of men and 
a chief source of fallacy in logic is the employment 
qftlie will in place ©understanding attention 
to which is the more necessary logically and 
ethically because men are naturally disposed to 
employ their active faculties of which the wiu is 
principal to the suppression of their passive facul 
ties the chief of which is the understandings the 
source of all regulation and just control the errors 
of which compared with those of the will are mere 
shadows whence vicious fallacies belong more to 
ethics than to logic in the eloquence of will 
passion and desire men compromise their own 
reason and inveigle and betray the understanding 
and will of others and it is in this chief error to 
which we have already adverted that sophistry may 
be said to precede and transcend logic the proper 
limit of which is understanding hence the ignoratio 
elenchij or mistake of the question is an involun 
tary source of fallacy which nothing but the reform 
of understanding can repair 

 it extends the bounds of logical fallacy

sophistry or fallacies 

that the yarious significations of a word give rise 
to ambiguities nor is there a fallacy of logic that 
can be otherwise resolyed than by determining 
the genuine significations of the words and propo 
sitions employed therein when any one of good 
understanding and experience acquainted with the 
groundwork of logic will not be deceived even by 
the most specious fallacies 

 the resolution of sophisms requires in 
au cases that we should reduce the question to its 
simplest terms so as to resolve it into its logical 
and philological elements and disclose its weakness 
or falsehood which lies most commonly iajalse 
inductions assuming a particular specifically a 
species generically or a genus universally or one 
of these for the others respectively in syllogistic 
sophisms the fallacy is usually found in the uni 
versal or major proposition which requires to be 
proved by induction or analogism rules in 
special cases are abundant in works of logic for 
solution of fallacies which are accessible without 
art in the minor premiss 

 analogism is even more capable of fal 
lacies and fale applications than the syllogism and 
generalogism and to this it owes some discredit

against by the analogist who in employing it will 
be apt to paralogise through allegory metaphor 
simile and to deceiye himself and others by rheto 
rical remote false and mystical analogies in place 
of the logical and true such fallacies are how 
ever easily resolved by carrying their premises 
home to reason and fact distinguishing their 
poetical from logical truth and verbal analogies 
from real ones 

 sophistry as an art has many wiles and 
practices among which may be principally noticed 
the assumption of false principles the substitution 
of terms or of thoughts or of things or of either 
of these for the others through which the pre 
mises and conclusions in each of the logical forms 
become vitiated 

 another source of sophistry and fallacy 
is the innovation upon the premises by the bring 
ing in of new matter or the leaving out of some 
thing essential in all of which there is a shifting of 
the position or proposition and accordingly the 
practisers of evasion in any way are in vulgar lan 
guage called shifty 

 and although in arguing on new ground 
it may be sometimes expedient or even necessary 
to change the position to rectify the premises it 
is requisite at the same time to recommence or 
review the argument but these are more fre

sophistry or fallacies 

quently artifices contrived to elude or confute 
an antagonist than either for fair argument 
or from inadvertence and selfdeception through 
false zeal or want of knowledge and skill never 
theless if there were not such craft on the one 
hand and such inadvertence and credulity on 
the other this discipline might decay for want 
of exercise 

 to shift the argument from one genus or 
species to a different one more or less remote the 
fijtrdouftg sig axxo yivog of aristotle is rhetorical 
rather than logical and at best when used in igno 
rance only is an argument of similitude merely 
metaphorical arguing from one category to ano 
ther is a like fallacy 

 the tacit law of argument that a parti 
can neither dispute nor retract a position he has 
advanced or admitted is itself illogical and a rule 
only of expedience for terminating a debate without 
settling the question but that which is advanced 
contrary to reason may with reason be retracted 
and ought to be so given up for the sake of truth 
and candour 

 every fair logical argument is an experi 
mental inquiry wherein positions are advanced or 
retracted till reason and truth are satisfied for 
that which is fair for one litigant is fair for all 
others and if it is just for an opponent to annul 
his adversarys position with reason it is fair also

sophistry or fallacies 

sophistry from a recent irish newspaper deserves 
celebrity — connelly a vagrant of notoriously bad 
character was arraigned for sheepstealing at gal 
way assizes where he had often before been tried 
for that and other offences committed so inge 
niously that he was always acquitted for want of 
evidence it was proved in this instance that he 
had sold legs of mutton in open market for six 
pence apiece c c j lopdell esq a very 
corpulent gentleman was the prosecutor and 
connelly being called on for his defence submitted 
to the court that all the evidence given on the part 
of the prosecutor must be construed in his favour — 
that the fact of his having been so often tried and 
acquitted clearly proved he must be an honest man 
— that no man is known till he is tried — the more 
frequently gold is melted in the fire to prove its 
genuineness the purer it becomes and so it is 
with character when tried he further insisted 
that the fact of his having meat in his possession 
and going about the country to sell it at a moderate 
price was a demonstration of innocence and proved 
him to be a man of industrious habits prosecuting 
his trade fairly and finally he submitted that 
his case was analogous to that of the prophet 
jonas for when he escaped from the whales belly 
he went forth an untainted character and so 
should he consider his escape from the clutches of 
mr lopdell who was to his mind very like a

that the whole of the evidence proved him an ho 
nest man and it was impossible the jury should do 
other than acquit him the eloquent ingenious 
and witty defence of this hibernian socrates ad 
mirably illustrates the logic of the bar inductive 
syllogistic and analogical and the most approved 
maxims of advocacy nor can we well doubt of the 
natural qualification of this man for the most ele 
vated attainments of the bar 

 the advocate pleader and demagogues 
practice was a regular art and artifice among the 
greeks from whom it descended through the ro 
mans to ourselves and aristotle reduced the 
art of forensic attack and defence as he found it 
in the treatises of pamphilus and calippus in his 
time to a single principle founded on the rule of 
contraries to this effect that whatever inay he 
urged in favour on the one party may be produced 
in accusation on the other and that whatever 
can be urged against the one will equally answer 

for the defence of the other coincident with

of an adversary into jests and oppose his jests with

sophistry or fallacies 

elusion as to the bold assertion of false premises 
and thence arguing fairly to a false conclusion 
this is a great ajid fundamental fallacy common 
to writers on every subject who have some inter 
ested purpose or tenet to establish and accommodate 
with principles or an hypothesis ingeniously fitted 
to their end in this there is a petitio principiiy or 
begging of the question and arguing in a circle 
which is not seen nor always used with design but 
often with great simplicity and sincerity 

 as all confutation of argument ends in 
establishing truth or reducing the argument to 
absurdity and as absurdity is ridiculous there is 
established thereon a mode of sophistry the ground 
of which is that as ridicule is founded on absurdity 
so may the absurdity of any question be established 
by ridicule but this argument itself is absurd 
and ridicule is essentially ridiculous in logic having 
no pretension to reason and being foimded alto 
gether on the sensual regard to laughter and con 
tempt and if it be at all logical it is the medium 
between reason and force hardly a lawful remove 
from the logic of the fist and preferable only as less 
violent and little less degrading 

 ridicule which throws the mind off its 
balance as laughter and intoxication do the body 
is in an argument principally allowable against 
itself it being fair in all contentions to turn the 
delusive and unlawful weapons of assailants against 
themselves whether they be instruments of ridicule

scurrility irony or iron and although truth may 
hear all lights as lord shafteshury has asserted 
yet will it take the colour of thelight thrown upon 
it and ridicule may cast upon truth a gleam of 
the ridiculous although it cannot penetrate to de 
stroy it and although like the diamond truth is 
not injured hy casting dirt upon it it may never 
theless he therehy soiled and ohscured the use of 
such weapons in serious and honourable contest is 
therefore the mark of a degraded and undisciplined 
mind indigent of lawful instruments and unskilled 
in exercise 

 the proper matter or object and correlate 
of the ridiculous is the absurd the absurd is 
the irreconcilable being without ratio or relation 
if the object be sensibly ridiculous or absurd it 
provokes laughter hence the sophist turns 
laughter or ridicule to logical account by putting 
the effect for the cause and therefrom inferring 
absurdity but this is in effect a petitio principii 

ick proving nothing — a logical weapon of 
folly and falsehood 

 satire is an illegitimate logic of this kind 
that confutes by debasing and confounding and 
however keenly sarcastic or humorously witty it 
produces neither logical conviction nor honest sym 
pathy and we may thus address him —

and true the law in nature — morals — art — 
for satire still reacts upon the heart 
you say tis proper punishment of evil 
but whod be executioner or devil 

 nevertheless there is an appropriate use 
of ridicule in reproof of the palpable follies of man 
kind nor can there be any just objection against 
the limited use of mock argument which negates 
itself for the purpose of wholesome satire in 
correcting of those vices and errors which neither 
reason nor lawful authority are allowed to reach 

 when strong prejudice falls upon argu 
ment reason and ridicule are equally unavailing 
and as in all false argument there is some preju 
dice the fairest least offensive and perhaps the 
most efficacious mode of confatatioriy is in the 
method of concession to grant the false positions 
and premises of the disputant and to urge them to 
extremes which never fail to terminate in ab 
surdity more vehement attacks are eluded by this 
reductio ad ahsurdum and the antagonist falls by 
his own weight and impetus there is also some 
times a cutting and powerful reproof of this kind in 
silence 

 these exemplify the argumentum ad ho 
minenti which employs an opponents own argu 
 ments and turns a mans weapons upon himself 
when the argumentum ad judicium is rendered 
useless by prejudice on the one hand and the

might be as dangerous as it is totally illegal on the 
other and these are the three celebrated and sole 
simple forms of natural disputation as sensible 
intellectual and physical from which others are 
deduced or compounded 

 as to controversial and contentious argu 
ments there can be no such things when words 
and terms are rightly understood the premises 
truly laid and the consequents justly deduced to 
these objects dissidents should direct their atten 
tion for truth and justice cannot fail to agree but 
through want of knowledge or understanding or of 
sincerity and honesty in the litigants 

 and as to scholastic tilting wrangling 
and debate in particular they are mere logodsedaly 
and quibble or a war of words which though 
affecting to employ reason puts the winning of the 
game or victory in the place of truth and is alto 
gether sensual unknown to true philosophy un 
worthy of the logician and may be properly con 
signed with all the logic of sophistry factious 
clamour and special pleading to the abusers of 
reason at the hustings the rostrum and the bar 

 the most common sophistry as well as 
the most seducing is that which appeals to the 
passions affections and tastes of men which ad 
dresses their hopes fears or interests as ethical

do or even the senses as all do who put glowing

and figures to the imagination in the place of 
reasons and substitute a fine style for just and 
legitimate argument for these however eligible 
as literary aids are neither logical nor philoso 
phical appeals to common sense opinion and 
prejudice in matters of reason and fact are also 
grossly sophistical and beneath the logician 

 there is not a more sophistical conduit to 
error than the natural proneness of men to run to 
extremes regardless that truth is relatiye and con 
sists in a concurrent mean between erroneous ex 
tremes whence the correct maxim that the oppo 
site of truth isjbhehood is converted into a perverse 
maxim that the opposite of falsehood is truth but 
unity is the attribute of truth as duplicity and 
diversity are of falsehood and error and as 
falsehood is usually an extreme so is its opposite 
commonly another extreme a second falsehood 
whence it is a rule of logic that contrary judg 
mentsi though they may be both false cannot be 
both true 

 hence we seldom fail to attain truth by 
taking the side of an opponent according to the 
method of concession before adduced and pushing 
the question to its utmost extreme if it gain 
strength thereby we may acknowledge ourselves 
wrong it will otherwise run into absurdity and 
prove that we were right we thus relinquish 
opposition to become acceptable partisans to the ear 
of our adversary in which way we seldom fail to

 of sophistical dialectics the autolcal

judgments and belongs to the logic of the will 
of which we have before spoken it is the royal 
road of logic and like all the royal roads of 
science and art is the easiest and most sought 
though it leads to nothing james il asserted 
a proposition and as often as wiser people ventured 
respectfully to shew that it was erroneous he as

amply discussed in many principal works of the 
logicians 



conclusion 

 the main design of the foregoing outline 
of the logical sciences being to exhibit analogism 
as the prime organ of reason in the eviction of 
truth universally and to vindicate reason as the 
presiding faculty and authority throughout logic 
and philosophy should it seem that we have too 
zealously invested reason and analogism with un 
warranted or misapplied powers therein a brief 
retrospect of its principles may serve to justify our 
positions and objects

reason we have seen that it is amenable to con 
sciousnessj and that consciousness is of triple re 
ference being either of sense which is physical of

conclusion 

reason which is logical or oi faith which is ethical 
s but physics logic and ethics comprise the 
philosophic universe consciousness regarded lo 
gically is also of like triple reference subjectively — 
to conception to conviction and to conscience — 
in objective regard to physicalcfo logical truths 
and ethical goods and these in conjoint reference 
to conceptions of sense convictions of reason and to 
faith of conscience 

 it is apparent hence that the triple ground 
of conscious reliance is conceptions of external 
facts internal convictions of truth and practical 
conscience of good which latter is the end of all 
thought and practice moral political and reli 
gious and the final object of faith and conscience 

 in this triple reference of consciousness to 
the external facts through sense and conception — 
to medial truths through conviction of reason and 
understanding — and to internal and moral goods 
through will and conscience or faith reason is the 
presiding authority in triple alliance withaith and 
facts for faith is subject to be influenced by fancy 
or imagination and facts are liable to all the de 
fects of memory and misapprehensions of sense 
while reason or relation is invariable according to 
that universal analogy wherein pure intellect 
identifies all faculties and energies 

 it results therefore as both correlate and 
corollary that the appeal of intellect is of triple 
regard whereby facts lead to truths and truths to

 conclusion 

good thstfiicts are incredible when opposed to 
truth and reason and truths are untenable that are 
opposed to faith of conscience and good although 
in their integrity these three agree in unity of in 
tellect and end and that good is of higher regard 
and purpose individually than truth and truth of 
more authority than facts but that in the disagree 
ment of either we have ground for suspense 

 we have cause therefore to doubt con 
victions that are against pure conscience and to 
doubt conceptions of sense that are against convic 
tions of reason as we have to yield facts in all 
cases to truth and every thing to good finally in 
no case ought we to subvert certain good for the 
sake of apparent truth nor to avert certain truth 
in favour of sensible things for truth and fact are 
subordinate to good and there is ever something 
erroneous and wrong when fact truth and good do 
not harmonise or in other words when ends are 
not justified by reason and fact or reason and 
fact fail to educe good there is thus unity of the 
logical and philosophical — of the noological or 
subjective with the physiological or objective sys 
tems of the universe which it should be the 
ultimate aim of logic and philosophy to establish 
ethically 

 evident and admitted as such universal 
unity is it is nevertheless of difficult developement 
and conception or being conceived is of infinitely 
greater difficulty to convey to other minds through

conclusion 

the entangled medium of language — to say nothing 
of that natural imperfection of things which is the 
principle of their union for since imperfection in 
anything is want of or dependence on something 
else imperfection must he an essential condition 
throughout the natural universe wherehy its parts 
and particulars are commutually supplied connected 
and continued by its allsufficient author in one 
universal dependent and perfect whole 

 much more then does imperfection be 
long to the works and doings of men who are 
dependent particles only of the creation in want 
of all things and in whose practice accordingly 
perfection is unattainable although every art and 
practice has good for its end and aim and if in 
their reason the object of which is truth men have 
higher pretension to perfection than in practice it 
is a perfection theoretic and speculative only 
hence the aim at good should not be an aim at 
perfection but at improvement or melioration and 
the world is finding this out 

 we trust therefore that we have neither 
assigned undue authority to the logical faculties 
nor misapplied their powers ethically for in a 
time when rights are held paramount to duties 
and right of truth is made to precede right of good 
it is important that a work bearing on these ques 
tions should not be misunderstood through the in 
adequacy of its details for which we have little 
hope of approbation and look for its objects only

 conclusion 

to the natural development of the logical intellect 
and the growing powers of the analogical organ 

 our next attempt will be to apply the 
logic of analogism to the extension of our outline 
of ethics as that branch of universal science to 
which it is most purely and especially related and 
of most general interest and importance including 
morals politics and theology
