gentlemen — we concluded in our last lecture the lect 

consideration of syllogisms viewed as incorrect or 

false in other words the doctrine of fallacies in so 
far as the fallacy lies within a single syllogism this 
however you will notice does not exhaust the consider 
ation of fallacy in general for there are various species 
of false reasoning which may affect a whole train of 
syllogisms these — of which the pctitio principii 
the ignoratio elenchi the circulns and the saltiis in 
concludendo are the principal — wul be appropriately 
considered in the sequel when we come to treat of the 
doctrine of probation or demonstration with fal 
lacies terminated the one great division of pure logic

opentheothergreat division — the doctrine of method 
or methodology — with the following paragraph 

lxxx a science is a complement of cog 
nitions having in point of form the character 
of logical perfection in point of matter the 
character of real truth 

the constituent attributes of logical perfec 
tion are the perspicuity the completeness the 
harmony of knowledge but the perspicuity 
completeness and harmony of our cognitions 
are for the human mind possible only through 
method 

lethod in general denotes a procedure in the 
treatment of an object conducted according to 
determinate rules method in reference to sci 
ence denotes therefore the arrangement and ela 
boration of cognitions according to definite rules 
with the view of conferring on these a logical 
perfection the iiethods by which we proceed 
in the treatment of the objects of our knowledge 
are two or rather method considered in its inte 
grity consists of two processes — analysis and 
synthesis 

i the analytic or regressive — in which de 
parting from the individual and the determined 
we ascend always to the more and more general 
in order finally to attain to ultimate principles 

ii the synthetic or progressive — in which 
we depart from principles or universals and from 
these descend to the determined and the indi 
vidual 

through the former we investigate and ascer 
tain the reality of the several objects of science

in its stoicheiology or doctrine of elements logic expiic 
considers the conditions of possible thought for thought pomibiiuy 
can only be exerted under the general laws of identity ™ of 
contradiction excluded middle and reason and con’’ 
sequent and through the general forms of concepts 
judgments and reasonings these therefore may 
be said to constitute the elements of thought but 
we may consider thought not merely as existing but 
as existing well that is we may consider it not only 
in its possibility but in its perfection and this per 
fection in so far as it is dependent on the form of 
thinking is as much the objectmatter of logic as the 
mere possibility of thinking now that part of logic 
which is conversant with the perfection — with the 
wellbeing of thought is the doctrine of method — 
methodology 

ilethod in general is the regulated procedure to method in 
wards a certain end that is a progress governed by wh’ 
rules which guide us by the shortest way straight 
towards a certain point and guard us against devi

iect accomplishmeut of this perfection the methodology of 
— logic must be accommodated and conducive but 
science that is a system of true or certain knowledge 
lu perfcc supposes two couditious of these the first has a re 
mat and lation to the knowing subject and supposes that what 
 ¦ is known is known clearly and distinctly completely 
and in connection the second has a relation to the 
objects known and supposes that what is known has 
a true or real existence the former of these consti 
tutes the formal perfection of science the latter is the 
material 

logic ukc now as logic is a science exclusively conversant 
only the about the form of thought it is evident that of these 
fconr two conditions — of these two elements of science or 
perfect thinking logic can only take into account the 
formal perfection which may therefore be distinc 
tively denominated the logical perfection of thought 
logical logical methodology will therefore be the exposition 
oil of the rules and ways by which we attain the formal 
or logical perfection of thought 

methoain liethod considered in general — considered in 

tsu™ its unrestricted universality — consists of two processes 

matom” correlative and complementary of each other for 
it proceeds either from the whole to the parts or from 
the parts to the whole as proceeding from the whole 
tiimn parts that is as resolving as unloosing a com 

plex totahty into its constituent elements it is ana 
lytic as proceeding from the parts to the whole that 
is as recomposing constituent elements into their 
complex totality it is synthetic these two processes 
are not in strict propriety two several methods but 
together constitute only a single method each alone 
is imperfect — each is conditioned or consummated by

the other and as i formerly observed® analysis and lect 

synthesis are as necessary to themselves and to the 

life of science as expiration and inspiration in connec

of animal existence 

it is here proper to make you aware of the confusion confaion 
which prevails in regard to the application of the terms the amilica

from the meaning of the words that the term analysis sjnihcii 
can only be applied to the separation of a whole into 
its parts and that the term synthesis can only be ap 
plied to the collection of parts into a whole so far 
no ambiguity is possible — no room is left for abuse 


but you are aware that there are different kinds of thc cuun 
whole and parts and that some of the wholes like

that what iu the one is a part is necessarily in the 
other a whole it is evident then that the counter 
processes of analysis and synthesis as applied to these 
counter wholes and parts should fall into one or cor 
respoud inasmuch as each in the one quantity should 
be diametrically opposite to itself in the other thus 
analysis as applied to comprehension is the reverse 
process of analysis as applied to extension but a 
corresponding process with synthesis and vice versa 
now should it happen that the existence and opposi 
tion of the two quantities are not considered — that 
men viewing the whole of extension or the whole of 
comprehension each to the exclusion of the other 
must define analysis and synthesis with reference 
to that single quantity which they exclusively take 
into account — on this supposition i say it is mani 
fest that if different philosophers regard different 
wholes or quantities we may have the terms analysis 
and synthesis absolutely used by different philosophers 
in a contrary or reverse sense and this has actually 
happened the ancients iu general looking alone to 
the whole of extension use the terms analysis and 
analytic simply to denote a division of the genus into 
species — of the species into individuals the moderns 
on the other hand in general looking only at the 
whole of comprehension employ these terms to express 
a resolution of the individual into its various attri 
butes® but though the contrast in this respect 
between the ancients and moderns hohls in general 
still it is exposed to sundry exceptions for in both 
periods there are philosophers found at the same game 
of crosspurposes with their contemporaries as the

ancients and modems in general are with each other 
this difference which has never as far as i know been 
fully observed and stated is the cause of great con 
fusion and mistake it is proper therefore when we 
use these terms to use them not in exclusive relation 
to one whole more than to another and at the same 
time to take care that we guard against the misappre 
hension that might arise from the vague and onesided 
view which is now universally prevalent so much 
for the meaning of the words cutahjtic and synthetic 
which by the way i may notice are hke most of our 
logical terms taken fiuin geometry® 

the synthetic method is likewise called the pro 
gressive the analytic is called the regressive now 
it is plain that this application of the temis progressive 
and regressive is altogether arbitrary for the import 
of these words expresses a relation to a certain point 
of departure — a terminus a quo and to a certain point 
of termination — a termimis ad quern and if these 
have only an arbitrary existence the correlative words 
will consequently only be of an arbitrary application 
but it is manifest that the point of departure — the 
point from which the progiessive process starts — may 
be either the concrete realities of our experience — the 
principiata — the notiora nobis or the abstract gen 
eralities of intelligence — the principia — the notiora 
natura each of these has an equal right to be re 
garded as the startingpoint the analytic process is 
chronologically first in the order of knowledge and 
we may therefore reasonably call it the progressive 
as starting from the primary data of our observation

lect on the other hand the synthetic process as followmg 
the order of constitution is first in the order of nature 
and we may therefore likewise reasonably call it the 
progressive as starting from the primary elements of 
existence the application of these terms as syno 
nyms of the analytic and synthetic processes is as 
wholly arbitrary manifestly open to confusion and 
contradiction and such has been the case i find 
that the philosophers are as much at crosspurposes in 
their application of these terms to the analytic and 
synthetic processes as in the application of analysis 
and synthesis to the different wholes 

in general in general however both in ancient and modern 
hmn times synthesis has been called the progressive 
the progree analysis the regressive process an application of 
anivi terms which has probably taken its rise from a pas 
ito wo sage in aristotle who says that there are two ways 
of scientific procedure — the one from principles dvro 
toiv dpxiiv the other to principles ini rds dpds 
from this and from another similar passage in

process of comprehensive synthesis progrediendi a

applications of method by which logic accomplishes lect 
the formal perfection of thought in doing this it is — i — i 
evident that if the formal perfection of thought is 
made up of various virtues logic must accommodate 
its method to the acquisition of these in detail and 
that the various processes by which these several 
virtues are acquired will in their union constitute the 
system of logical methodology on this i will give 
you a paragraph 

lxxxi the formal perfection of thought pr lxxxi 
is made up of the three virtues or characters — wethod 
° of clearness ° of distinctness involving three part 
completeness and ° of harmony the char 
acter of clearness depends principally on the de 
termination of the comprehension of our notions 
the character of distinctness depends principally 
on the development of the extension of our 
notions and the character of harmony on the 
mutual concatenation of our notions the rules 
by which these three conditions are fulfilled con 
stitute the three parts of logical methodology 

of these the first constitutes the doctrine of 
definition the second the jdocnnc of division 
and the third the doctrine oj probation

lect “when we turn attention on our thoughts and 
 deal with them to the end that they may be consti 
tuted into a scientific whole we must perform a three 
fold operation we must first of all consider what 
we think that is what is comprehended in a thought 
in the second place we must consider how many 
things we think of that is to how many objects the 
thought extends or reaches that is how many are 
conceived under it in the third place we must con 
sider why we think so and so and not in any other 
manner in other words how the thoughts are bound 
together as reasons and consequents the first con 
sideration therefore regards the comprehension the 
second the extension the third the concatenation of 
our thoughts but the comprehension is ascertained 
by definitions the extension by divisions and the 
concatenation by probations”® we proceed therefore 
to consider these three parts of logical methodology 
in detail and first of declaration or definition in 
regard to which i give the following paragraph 

pr lxxxii lxxxii how to make a notion clear is 
trine of de shown by the logical doctrine of declaration or 

litmui definition in its wider sense a declaration or 
definition in its wider sense is a categorical 
proposition consisting of two clauses or members 
viz of a subject defined membrwm definituni 
and of the defining attributes of the subject that 
is those by which it is distinguished from other 
things memhrum difinicns this latter mem 
ber really contains the definition and is often 
itself so denominated simple notions as con

taining no plurality of attributes are incapable lect 
of definition 

the terms declaration and definition which are here eipiica 
used as applicable to the same process express it xhotorm 
however in different aspects the term declaration and dchni 
declaratio is a word somewhat vaguely employed in ditiljlio 
english it is here used strictly in its proper sense 
of throwing light upon — clearing up the term dfini“ 
tion definitio is employed in a more general and in 
a more special signification of the latter we are soon 
to speak at present it is used simply in the meaning 
of an enclosing within limits — the separating a thing 
from others were the term declaration not of so vague 
and vacillating a sense it would be better to employ it 
alone in the more general acceptation and to reserve 
the term definition for the special signification 

h lxxxiii the process of definition islxxxm 
founded on the logical relations of subordination in iuitricwr 
coordination and congnience to this end we 
discriminate the constituent characters of a no 
tion into the essential or those which belong to 
it in its unrestricted universality and into the 
u nessential or those which belong to some only 
of its species the essential are again discrim 
inated into original and derivative a division 
which coincides with that into internal or pro 
per and external in giving the sum of the 
original characters constituent of a notion con 
sists its definition in the stricter sense a de

ginal characters viz that of the gemis imme

from its coordinates as a distinct species liola 
specialis differentia specifica 

declarations or definitions in the wider sense ob 
vmi’om tain various denominations according as the process 
dsiaioii is performed in different manners and degrees a 
explica declaration is called an explication explicatio when 
the predicate or defining member indeterminately 
evolves only some of the characters belonging to the 
expoition subject it is called exposition expositio when 
the evolution of a notion is continued through several 
dacripiion cxphcations it is called a description descriptio 
when the subject is made known tlirough a number of 
definition concrete characteristics finally it is called a defi 
’™ ration proper when as i have said two of the essen 
tial and original attributes of the defined subject are 
given whereof the one is common to it with the 
various species of the same genus and the other dis 
criminates it from these 

dornitionn definitions are distinguished also into verbal or 
nominal into eeal and into genetic definitiones no 
gcnciic reales geneticw according as they are con 

versant with the meaning of a term with the nature 
of a thing or with its rise or production” nominal 
definitions are it is evident merely explicsitions 
they are therefore in general only used as prelim

considered as already there as existing and the 
notion therefore as given precedes the definition 
they are thus merely analytic that is nothing is 
given explicitly in the predicate or defining member 
which is not contained implicitly in the subject or 
member defined in genetic definitions the defined 
subject is considered as in the progress to be as be 
coming yiyvofievop the notion therefore has to be 
made and is the result of the definition which is con

defining member more than is given in the subject or 
member defined as examples of these three species

genetic definition — a circle is formed when we draw 
around and always at the same distance from a fixed 
point a movable point which leaves its trace until 
the termination of the movement coincides with the 
commencement it is to be observed that only those 
 notions can be genetically defined which relate to 
quantities represented in time and space mathema 
tics are principally conversant with such notions and 
it is to be noticed that the mathematician usually de 
nominates such genetic definitions real definitions 
while the others he calls without distinction nominal

attribute should be given which the thing defined lect 

has in common with others of the same class and in 

the second place that attribute should be given which 
not only distinguishes it in general from all other 
things but proximately from things which are in 
cluded with it under a common class this is ex 
pressed by logicians in the rule — definitio constet 
geirere joximo et d lfferenlia uuima — let the defin 
ition consist of the nearest genus and of the lowest 
difference but as the notion and its definition if this 
ride be obeyed are necessarily identical or convertible 
notions they must necessarily have the same extent 
consequently everything to which the definition ap 
plies and nothing to which it does not apply is the 
thing defined thus — if the definition man is a 
rational onimaz be adequate we shall be able to say 
— every rational animal is human — nothing which 
is not a rational animal is human but we cannot say 
this for though this may be true of this earth we can 
conceive in other worlds rational animals which are 
not human the definition is therefore in this case 
too wide to make it adequate it will be necessary to 
add terrestrial or some such term — as ian is a ra 
tional animal of this earth again were we to define 
man — a rationally acting animal of this earth — the 
definition would be too narrow for it would be false 
to say no animal of this earth not acting rationally is 
human for not only children but many adult persons 
would be excluded by this definition which is there 
fore too narrow 

the second rule is — that the definition should not second 
be made by negations or disjunctions in regard to 
the former — negations — that we should define a thing

by what it is and not by what it is not — the reason 
of the rule is manifest the dehnition should be an 
affirmative proposition for it ought to contain the 
positive the actual qualities of the notion defined 
that is the qualities which belong to it and which 
must not therefore be excluded from or denied of it 
if there are characters which as referred to the sub 
ject afford purely negative judgments — this is a proof 
that we have not a proper comprehension of the no 
tion and have only obtained a precursory definition 
of it enclosing it within only negative boundaries 
for a definition which contains only negative attribu 
tions affords merely an empty notion — a notion which 
is to be called a nothing for as some think it must 
at least possess one positive character and its defin 
ition cannot therefore be made up exclusively of 
negative attributes if however a notion stands op 
posed to another which has already been declared by 
positive characters it may be defined by negative 
characters — provided always that the genus is posi 
tively determined thus cuvier and other naturalists 
define a certain order of animals by the negation of a 
spine or backbone — the invertehrata as opposed to 
the vertehmta and many such definitions occur in 
natural history 

for a similar reason the definition must not consist 
of divisive or disjunctive attributions the end of a 
definition is a clear and distinct knowledge but to 
say that a thing is this or that or the other affords us 
either no knowledge at all or at best only a vague 
and obscure knowledge if the disjunction be contra 
dictory its enunciation is in fact tantamount to zero 
for to say that a thing either is or is not so and so 
is to tell us that of which we required no assertiou

tives is though it may vaguely circumscribe a notion — i l 

only to be considered as a prelusory definition and 
as the mark of an incipient and yet imperfect know 
ledge we must not however confound definitions 
by divisive attributes with propositions expressive of 
a division 

the third rule is — “ the definition should not be xhini rui 
tautological that is what is defined should not be 
defined by itself this vice is called defining in a defining in 
circle this rule may be violated either immediately 
or mediately the definition — law is a lawful com 
mand — is an example of the immediate circle a me 
diate circle requires at least two correlative defin 
itions a principal and a subsidiary for example — 

law is the expressed wish of a ruler and a rider is 
one who establishes laies the circle whether imme 
diate or mediate is manifest or occult according as 
the thing defined is repeated in the same terms or 
with other synonymous words in the previous 
example it was manifest in the following it is con 
cealed — gratitude is a virtue of acknowledgment — 

right is the competence to do or not to do such 
declarations may however be allowed to stand as pre 
lusory or nominal definitions concealed circular de 
finitions are of very frequent occurrence when they 
are at the same time mediate or remote for we are 
very apt to allow ourselves to be deceived by the dif 
ference of expression and fancy that we have declared 
a notion when we have only changed the language

procally by each other st’ axkijov in probation

we may i think call them by the homely english 
appellation of the seesau — 

the fourth rule is — “ that the definition should be 
precise that is contain nothing unessential nothing 
superfluous unessential or contingent attributes are 
not sufiiciently characteristic and as they are now 
present now absent and may likewise be met with in 
other things which are not comprehended under the 
notion to be defined they consequently if admitted 
into a definition render it sometimes too wide some 
times too narrow the wellknown platonic defini 
tion — ‘ man is a twolegged animal toithoul feathers’ 
— could as containing only unessential characters be 
easily refuted as was done by a plucked cock and 
when a definition is not wholly made up of such attri 
butes and when in consequence of their intermixture 
with essential characters the definition does not abso 
lutely fail still there is a sin committed against logical 
purity or precision in assuming into the declaration 
qualities such as do not determinately designate what 
is defined on the same principle all derivative cha 
racters ought to be excluded from the definition for 
although they may necessarily belong to the thing 
defined stiu they overlay the declaration with super 
fluous accessories inasmuch as such characters do not 
designate the original essence of the thing but are a 
mere consequence thereof this fault is committed in 
the following definition — the cirele is a curved hue 
returning upon itself the jiarts of which are at an equal

lated though the definition be otherwise correct for 

that every line returning upon itself is curved and 
that the point from which all the parts of the line are 
equidistant is the central point — these are mere con 
sequences of the returning on itself and of the equi 
distance derivative characters are thus mixed up 
with the original and the definition therefore is not 
precise” “ 

the fifth rule is — “ that the definition should be fifth ruic 
lierspicuous that is couched in terms intelligible not 
figurative and compendious that definitions ought 
to be perspicuous is selfevident for why do we de 
clare or define at all the perspicuity of the defini order u

character of the language and this again depends on langi 
the emplojfment of words in their received or ordinary intelligible 
signification the meaning of words both separate 
and in conjunction is already determined by conven

we naturally associate with them their ordinary mean

arise from a deviation from the accustomed usage 
and though the definition in the sense of the definer 
may be correct stul false conceptions are almost in 
evitable for others if such a deviation becomes neces 
sary in consequence of the common meaning attached 
to certain words not corresponding to certain notions 
there ought at least to be appended a comment or

the second place words ought not only to be used in 
their usual signification — that signification if the de

proper tropes and figures are logical hieroglyphics 
and themselves require a declaration they do not 
indicate the thing itself but only something similar”®

understanding — the cynosura veritatis — the cyno

the mind kefi 

“ however many expressions originally metapho 
rical such as conception imagination comprehension 
representation c c have by usage been long since 
reduced from figurative to proper terms so that we 
may employ these in definitions without scruple — 
nay frequently must as there are no others to be 
found

depends iqon its brevity a long definition is not 
only burthensome to the memory but likewise to the 
understanding which ought to comprehend it at a 
single jet brevity ought not however to be pur 
chased at the expense of perspicuity or completeness” 

“ the rules hitherto considered proximately relate to 
definitions in the stricter sense in reference to the 
other kinds of declaration there are certain modifica 
tions and exceptions admitted these dilucidations 
or explications as they make no pretence to logical 
perfection and are only subsidiary to the discovery of 
more perfect definitions are not to be very rigidly

even a single tnie character by which we are con 
ducted to the apprehension of others they may 
therefore be sometimes too wide sometimes too nar 
row a contingent and derivative character may be 
also useful for the discovery of the essential and ori 
ginal even circular definitions are not here abso 
lutely to be condemned if thereby the language is 
rendered simpler and clearer figurative expressions 
are likewise in them less faulty than in definitions 
proper inasmuch as such expressions by the analogies 
they suggest contribute always something to the illus 
tration of the notion 

“ in regard to descriptions these must be adequate 
and no circle is permitted in them but they need 
not be so precise as to admit of no derivative or con 
tingent characters for descriptions ought to enume 
rate the characters of a thing as fully as possible and 
consequently they cannot be so brief as definitions 
they cannot however exceed a certain measure in 
point of length”®

methodology — the doctrine of division — the doctrine 
which affords us the rules of that branch of method 
by which we render our knowledge more distinct and 
exhaustive i shall preface the subject of logical 
division bj some observations on division in general 

“ under division divisio builpeats we understand 
in general the sundering of a whole into its parts® 
the object which is divided is called the divided whole 
totum divisum and this whole must be a connected 
many — a connected multiplicity for otherwise no 
division would be possible the divided whole must 
comprise at least one character affording the condition 
of a certain possible splitting of the object or through 
which a certain opposition of the object becomes 
recognised and this character must be an essential 
attribute of the object if the division be not aimless

alone the division is possible is called the iinciple of

if the parts be given and from them the whole sought 
out this is accomplished when we have discovered the 
order — the arrangement of the parts and this again 
is discovered when the principle of division is dis 
covered and of this we must obtain a knowledge 
either from the general nature of the thing or from 
the particular end we have in view if for example 
a multitude of books of every various kind are arranged 
into the whole of a wellordered library — in this case 
the greater or lesser similarit of subject will afford 
either exclusively or mainly the principle of division 
it happens however not unfrequently that the parts 
are ordered or arranged according to different rules 
and by them connected into a whole and in this 
case as the different rules of the arrangement 
cannot together and at once accomplish this it is 
proper that the less important arrangement should 
yield to the more important as for example in the 
ordering of a library when besides the contents of 
the books we take into account their language size

division supposes the knowledge of the whole to

or declaration and proposes to discover the 
parts of this whole which are found and deter

as logical definition therefore proposes to ren 
der the characters contained in an object that 
is the comprehension of a reality or notion 
clear logical division proposes to render the 
characters contained under an object that is the 
extension of a notion distinct and exhaustive 
division is therefore the evolution of the exten 
sion of a notion and it is expressed in a dis 
junctive proposition of which the notion divided 
constitutes the subject and the notions contained 
imder it the predicate it is therefore regu 
lated by the law which governs disjunctive 
judgments the principle of excluded middle 
although it is usually expressed in the form of a 
copulative categorical judgment the rules by 
which this process is regulated are seven — 

° every division should be governed by 
some principle divisio ne caveat fundamcnto 

° every division should be governed by only 
a single principle 

° the principle of division should be an 
actual and essential character of the divided 
notion and the division therefore neither com 
plex nor without a purpose 

° no dividing member of the predicate must 
by itself exhaust the subject 

° the dividing members taken together 
must exhaust but only exhaust the subject 

° the divisive members must be reciprocally 
exclusive 

° the divisions must proceed continuously 
from immediate to mediate differences divisio 
ne fkit cr saltum

in this paragraph are contained first the general lect 

principles of logical division and secondly the laws 

by which it is governed i shall now illustrate these 
in detail 

in the first place it is stated that “ the distinct 
ness and completeness of our knowledge is obtained 
by that logical process which is termed division 
divisio iatp€ri division supposes the know 
ledge of the whole to be given through a foregone 
process of definition and proposes to discover the 
parts of this whole which are found and determined 
not by the development of the comprehension but 
by the development of the extension as logical 
definition therefore proposes to render the characters 
contained in a notion that is its comprehension clear 
logical division proposes to render the characters con 
tained under an object that is the extension of a 
notion distinct division is therefore the evolution 
of the extension of a notion and it is expressed in a 
disjunctive proposition of which the notion divided 
constitutes the subject and the notions contained 
under it the predicate it is therefore regulated by 
the law which governs disjunctive judgments the 
principle of excluded middle although it be usually 
expressed in the form of a copulative categorical 
judgment” 

the special virtue — the particular element of per dofdm 
feet thinking which division enables us to acquire tiuctdmb 
is distinctness but at the same time it is evident toivm 
that it cannot accomplish this without rendering new 

out thinking more complete this however is only 
a secondary and collateral result for the problem 
which division proximately and principally proposes

to solve is — to afford us a distinct consciousness of 
the extension of a given notion through a complete 
or exhaustive series of subordinate or coordinate 
notions this utility of division in rendering our 
knowledge more complete is i find stated by aris 
totle® though it has been overlooked by subsequent 
logicians he observes that it is only by a regular 
division that we can be assured that nothing has been 
omitted in the definition of a thing 

“as it is by means of division that we discover 
what are the characters contained under the notion of 
an object it follows that there must be as many kinds 
of division possible as there are characters contained 
under the notion of an object which may afibrd the 
principle of a different division if the characters 
which afford the principle of a division are only ex 
ternal and contingent there is a division in the wider 
sense if again they are internal and constant there 
is a division in the stricter sense if finally they are 
not only internal but also essential and original there 

a uniorai is a division in the strictest sense from the very 

notiod thfi 

odit object conception of logical division it is manifest that it 

of logical iii • 

diviiion can only be applied where the object to be divided is 
a universal notion and that it is wholly inapplicable 
to an individual for as the individual contains no 
thing under it consequently it is not susceptible of 
an ulterior division the general problem of which 
division affords the solution is — to find the subor 
dinate genera and species the higher or generic notion 
being given the higher notion is always something 
abstracted — something generalised from the lower 
notions with which it agrees inasmuch as it contains 
all that is common to these inferior concepts and from 

a anal l li c

which it differs inasmuch as they contain a greater 
number of determining characters there thus sub 
sists an internal connection between the higher and 
the lower concepts and there is thus afforded a tran 
sition from the superior notion to the subordinate 
and consequently an evolution of the lower notions 
from the higher in order to discover the inferior 
genera and species we have only to discover those 
characters which afford the proximate determinations 
by which the sphere or extension of the higher notion 
is circumscribed but to find what characters are 
wanted for the thoroughgoing determination of a 
higher notion we must previously know what char 
acters the higher notion actually contains and this 
knowledge is only attainable by an analysis — a sund 
ering of the higher notion itself in doing this the 
several characters must be separately drawn forth and 
considered and in regard to each we must ascertain 
how far it must still be left undetermined and how 
far it is capable of opposite determinations but 
whether a character be still undetermined and of 
what opposite determinations it is capable — on these 
points it is impossible to decide a priori but only 
a posteriori through a knowledge of this particular 
character and its relations to other notions and the 
accomplishment of this is rendered easier by two 
circumstances — the one that the generic notion is 
never altogether abstract but always realised and held 
fast by some concrete form of imagination — the 
other that in general we are more or less acquainted 
with a greater or a smaller number of special notions 
in which the generic notion is comprehended and 
these are able to lead us either mediately or imme 
diately to other subordinate concepts

“ but the determinations or constituent characters 
of a notion which we seek out must not only be com 
pletely but also precisely opposed completely in 
asmuch as all the species subordinate to the notions 
ought to be discovered and precisely inasmuch as 
whatever is not actually a subordinate species ought 
to bo absolutely excluded from the notion of the 
genus 

“ in regard to the completeness of the opposition 
it is not however required that the notion should 
be determined through every possible contradictory 
opposition for those at least ought to be omitted 
concerning whose existence or nonexistence the notion 
itself decides in regard to the opposition itself it 
is not required that the division should be carried 
through by contradictory oppositions the only oppo 
sition necessary is the reciprocal exclusion of the 
inferior notions into which the higher notion is 
divided” “ in a mere logical relation indeed as we 
know nothing of the nature of a thing more than that 
a certain character either does or does not belong to 
it a strictly logical division can only consist of two 
contradictory members for example — that angles are 
either right or not right — that men are either white 
or not white but looking to the real nature of the 
thing known either a jriori or a posteriori the divi 
sion may be not only dichotomous but polytomous 
as for example — angles are right or acute or obtuse 
men are white or black or coppercoloured or olive 
coloured c 

we now come in the second place to the rules 
dictated for logical division 

these rules spring either ° from the principle of

division or ° from the eelations of the dividing lect 

” y y v 

members to the divided whole or “ from the 

relations of the several dividing members to each 
other or ° from the relations of the divisions to 
the subdivisions 

the first of these heads — the principle of division thom 
— comprehends the three first rules of these the i from the 
first is selfevident — there must be some principle wsm 
some reason for every division for otherwise there “• 
would be no division determined no division carried 
into effect 

in regard to the second rule — that every division second 
should have only a single principle — the propriety of 
this is likewise sufficiently apparent in every divi 
sion we should depart from a definite thought which 
has reference either to the notion as a unity or to some 
single character on the contrary if we do not do 
this but carry on the process by different principles 
the series of notions in which the division is realised 
is not orderly and homogeneous but heterogeneous 
and perplexed 

the third rule — that the principle of division should nunl 
be an actual and essential character of the divided 
notion — is not less manifest “ as the ground of divi 
sion is that which principally regulates the correctness 
of the whole process that is the completeness and 
opposition of the division — it follows that this groimd

and contingent but the internal and essential cha 
racters and of these those have the preeminence 
through whose determination the greater number of 
others are determined or what is the same thing 
from which as fundamental and original attributes 
the greater number of the others are derived the 
choice of character is however for the most part regu 
lated by some particular end so that under certain 
circumstances external and contingent characters may 
obtain a preponderant importance such ends cannot 
however be enumerated the character affording the 
principle of division must likewise be capable of being 
clearly and definitely brought out for unless this be 
possible we can have no distinct consciousness of the 
completeness and contrast of the determination of 
which it is susceptible we ought therefore always 
to select those characters for principles of division 
which are capable of a clear and distinct recogni 
tion” 

the second part of the rule — that the division be 
not therefore too complex and without a purpose — is 
a corollary of the first “ in dividing we may go on 
to infinity for while as was formerly shown there 
is in the series of higher and lower notions no one 
which can be conceived as absolutely the lowest 
so in subdividing there is no necessary limit to the 
process in like manner the coordinations may be 
extended ad infinitum for it is impossible to exhaust 
all the possible relations of notions and each of these 
may be employed as the principle of a new division 
thus we can divide men by relation to their age to 
their sex to their colour to their stature to their 
knowledge to their riches to their rank to their man

it would however be ridiculous and render the divi 
sions whouy useless if we multiplied them in this 
fashion without end we therefore intentionally 
restrict them that is we make them comparatively 
limited inasmuch as we only give tliem that complete 
ness which is conducive to a certain end in this 
manner divisions become relatively useful or acquire 
the virtue of adaptation in the selection of a prin 
ciple of division we must take heed whether it be 
fertile and pertinent a ground of division is fertile 
when it affords a division out of which again other 
important consequences may be drawn it is pertinent 
when these consequences have a proximate relation to 
the end on account of which we were originally in 
duced to develop the extension of a concept a prin 
ciple of division may therefore be useful with one 
intent and useless with another soldiers for example 
may be conveniently divided into cavalry and infantry 
as this distinction has an important influence on their 
determination as soldiers but in considering man in 
general and his relations it would be ludicrous to 
divide men into foot and horsemen while on the 
contrary their division would be here appropriate 
according to principles which in the former case would 
have been absurd seneca “ says well — ‘ quicquid in 
majus crevit facuius agnoscitur si discessit in partes

good or bad — for to these we should have added w 
indifferent and in the second place we transgress it

twice the dividing members must be so constituted 
that they are not mutually coincident so that they 
either in whole or in part contain each other this 
law is violated when in the first place a subdivision 
is placed above a division as — philosophy is either 
theoretical philosophy or moral philosophy or prac

practical ph ilosojjhy as a subordinate part or when 
in the second place the same thing is divided in dif

these opposite determinations being themselves again 
capable of opposite determinations in which gradual 
descent we may proceed indefinitely onwards — from 
this it is evident that the divisions should as far as 
possible be continuous that is the notion must first 
be divided into its proximate and then into its re 
moter parts and this without overleaping any one 
part or in other words each part must be immedi 
ately subordinated to its whole”® thus when some 
of the ancients divided philosophy into rational and 
•natural and moral the first and second members are 
merely subdivisions of theoretical philosophy to which 
moral as practical jhhosophy is opposed sometimes

of brevity allowed but this only imder the express 
condition that the omitted members are interpolated

are either right or acute or obtuse although if the 
division were continuous — without hiatus it would 
run angles arc either right or oblique and the ob

iii — doctrine of probation 

we now proceed to the third part of pure meth lect 

odology that which guides us to the third character i 

or virtue of perfect thinking — the concatenation of 
thought — i mean probation or the leading of proof 

i commence with the following paragraph 

 lxxxvi when there are propositions or pm lxxxvl 
judgments which are not intuitively manifest nturendeio 
and the truth of which is not admitted then 
their validity can only be established when we 
evolve it as an inference from one or more judg 
ments or propositions this is called probation 

proving or the leading of proof probalio ar 
gumentatio or dcmonstratio in its wider sense 

a probation is thus a series of thoughts in which 
a plurality of difierent judgments stand to each 
other in respect of their validity in the depend 
ence of determining and determined or of antece 
dents and consequents in every probation there 
are three things to be distinguished — ° the 
judgment to be proved thesis ° the ground

cogency of this principle to necessitate the con 
nection of antecedents and consequents vis de 
monstrationis or nevus prohandi from the 
nature of probation it is evident that probation 
without inference is impossible and that the 
thesis to be proved and the principles of proof 
stand to each other as conclusion and premises 
with this difference that in probation there is a 
judgment the thesis expressly supposed which in 
the syllogism is not at least necessarily the case” 

in regard to the terms here employed it is to be 
noticed that the tenn aiyumentation aigumentatio 
is applied not only to a reasoning of many syllogisms 
but likewise to a reasoning of one the term aryu 
ment aryumentnm in like manner is employed not 
only for the ground of a consecutive reasoning but 
for the middle term of a single syllogism but it is 
moreover vulgarly employed for the whole process of 
argumentation 

the term demonstration demonsl ratio is used in a 
looser and in a stricter signification in the former 
sense it is equivalent to johation or aryuraenta 
tion in yeneral in the latter to necessaty pnohation 
or aryumentation from intuitive pnnciples 

the expression icadiny of proof might perhaps be 
translated by the term deduction but then this term 
must be of such a latitude as to include induction to 
which it is commonly opposed for probation may be 
either a process of deduction that is the leading of

proof out of one higher or more general proposition 
or a process of induction that is the leading of proof 
out of a plurality of lower or less general judgments 

to prove is to evince the truth of a proposition not 
admitted to be true from other propositions the truth 
of which is already established in every probation 
there are three things to be distinguished — ° the pro 
position to be proved — the thesis ’ the grounds 
or principle of proof — the argument and ° the 
degree of cogency with which the thesis is inferred 
by the argumentum or argumenta — the vis or nervus 
lrobandi all probation is thus syllogistic but all 
syllogism is not probative the peculiarity of proba 
tion consists in this — that it expressly supposes a 
certain given proposition a certain thesis to be tnie 
to the establishment of this proposition the proof is 
relative this proposition constitutes the conclusion 
of the syllogism or series of syllogisms of which the 
probation is made up whereas in the mere syllogistic 
process this supposition is not necessarily involved 
it is also evident that the logical value of a probation 
depends — ° on the truth of its principles or argu 
menta ° on their connection with each other and 
with the thesis or proposition to be proved and ° 
on the logical formality of the inference of the thesis 
from its argumenta no proposition can be for an 
other the principle of proof which is not itself cither 
immediately or mediately certain a proposition is 
immediately certain or evident at first hand when 
by the very nature of thought we cannot but think 
it to be true and when it therefore neither requires 
nor admits of proof a proposition is mediately cer 
tain or evident at second hand when it is not at 
once and in itself thought as necessarily true but

according to this distinction the ground or prin

must ultimately rest on some intuitive truth — on some 
judgment at first hand is manifest if the fact of pro

such primary judgments are actually given is an ex 
position which as purely metaphysical lies beyond 
the sphere of logic®

following distinctions of propositions to which i 
formerly alluded and which i may again recall to

examples of this are given in the four fundamental aom 
laws of logic and in the mathematical common 
notions — tlte whole is greater than its part — if equals 
be added to equals the wholes are equal c a prac

is styled a postulate thus geometry postulates the potuif 
possibility of drawing lines — of producing them ad 
infinitum of describing circles c 

a theoretical proposition if mediate and demon thoorcm 
strable is called a theorem this is laid down as a 
thesis — as a judgment to be proved — and is proved 
from intuitive principles theoretical and practical 

a practical proposition if mediate and demonstrable 
is called a problem in the probation the problem problem 
itself is first enounced it is then sliown in the solu 
tion how that which is required is to be done — is to 
be effected and finally in the proof it is demonstrated 
that through this procedure the solution of the prob 
lem is obtained for example in the geometrical 
problem — to describe an equilateral triangle on a given 
straight line — there this problem is first stated the 
solution then shows that with this given line as a semi 
diameter we are to describe from each of its points 
of termination a circle the two circles will intersect 
each other and we are then from the point of inter 
section to draw straight lines to each point of ter 
mination this being done the proof finally demon 
strates that these circles must intersect each other 
that the drawn straight lines necessarily constitute a 
triangle and that this triangle is necessarily equila

of the mind itself and a contribution without which no 
act of experience becomes possible proofs again are 
called empirical or a posteriori if they rest on prin

observation and whose validity is cognisable in no 
other way than that of experience or observation 
vhen the principles of probation are such as are not 
contingently given by experience but spontaneously 
engendered by the mind itself these principles are 
always characterised by the qualities of necessity and 
universality consequently a proof supported by them 
is elevated altogether above the possibility of doubt 
avhen on the other hand the principles of probation 
are such as have only the guarantee of observation 
and experience for their truth — supposing even that 
the observation be correct and the experience stable 
and constant — these principles and consequently 
the probation founded on them can pretend neither 
to necessity nor universality seeing that what pro 
duces the observation or experience has only a rela 
tion to individual objects and is only competent to 
infonn us of what now is but not of what always is 
of what necessarily must be although however 
these empirical principles are impressed with the cha 
racter neither of necessity nor of universality they 
play a very important part in the theatre of human 
thought”® this distinction of proofs by reference 
to the matter of our knowledge is one indeed which 
logic does not take into account logic in fact con

here however the a riori principle is in reality only 
an empirical rule — only a generalisation from expe 
rience but with the manner in which these empi 
rical rules — bacon would call them axioms — are 
themselves discovered or evolved — with this pure 
logic has no concern this will fall to be considered 
in modified logic when we treat of the concrete 
doctrine of induction and analogy

contradiction it is impossible for us to think and if a 
character must be denied of an object — and that it 
must be so denied the probation has to show — then 
the contradictory opposite of that character is of 
necessity to be affirmed of that object the direct 
mode of probation has undoubtedly this advantage 
over the indirect — that it not only furnishes the 
soughtfor truth but also clearly develops its neces 
sary connection with its ultimate priuciples whereas 
the indirect demonstrates only the repugnance of some 
proposition with certain truths without however 
positively evincing the truth of its opposite and 
thereby obtaining for it a full and satisfactory recog 
nition it is therefore usually employed only to 
constrain a troublesome opponent to silence by a dis 
play of the absurdities which are implied in and

in the former case the probation goes from the sub 
ject to the predicate • in the latter case from the 
predicate to the subject where the probation is com 
plex — if synthetic the conclusion of the preceding syl 
logism is the subsumption of that following if analy 
tic the conclusion of the preceding syllogism is the 
sumption of that following in respect of certainty 
both procedures are equal and each has its peculiar 
advantages in consequence of which the combination 
of these two modes of proof is highly expedient but 
the analytic procedure is often comjjetent where 
the synthetic is not whereas the synthetic is never 
possible where the analytic is not and this is 
never possible where we have not a requisite stock of 
propositions already verified when the probation is

cations but in considering this law in its univer lect 
sality it is not to be understood as if every probation 
were at once to be rejected as worthless in which „nct‘l™h 
anything is presupposed and not proved were this 
its sense it would be necessary in every probation to 
ascend to the highest principles of human knowlelge 
and these themselves as immediate and consequently 
incapable of proof might be rejected as unproved 
assumptions were this the meaning of the law 
there could be no probation whatever but it is not 
to be understood in this extreme rigour that pro 
bation alone is a violation of this law and conse 
quently alone is vicious in which a proposition is 
assumed as a principle of proof which may be doubted 
on the ground on which the thesis itself is doubted 
and where therefore we prove the uncertain by the 
equally uncertain the probation must therefore 
depart from such principles as are either immediately 
given as ultimate or mediately admit of a proof from 
other sources than the proposition itself in question 

when for example it was argued that the newtonian 
theory is false which holds colours to be the result 
of a diversity of parts in light on the ground ad 
mitted by the ancients that the celestial bodies and 
consequently their emanations consist of homoge 
neous elements — this reasoning was inept for the 
principle of proof was not admitted by modern 
philosophers thus when aristotle defends the in 
stitution of slavery as a natural law on the ground 
that the barbarians as of inferior intellects are the 
born bondsmen of the greeks and the greeks as of 
superior intellect the bom masters of the barbarians®

— an argument wliicli has likewise been employed 
in modern times in the british parliament with the 
substitution of negroes for barbarians and whites 
for greeks — this argument is invalid as assuming 
what is not admitted by the opponents of slavery 
it would be a petitio principii to prove to the mo 
hammedan the divinity of christ from texts in the 
new testament for he does not admit the authority 
of the bible but it would be a valid argumentum 
ml hominem to prove to him from the koran the pro 
phetic mission of jesus for the authority of the koran 
he acknowledges 

the second ride that no proposition is to be em 
ployed as a principle of proof the truth of which is 
only to be evinced as a consequence of the proposi 
tion which it is emiiloyed to prove — is only a special 
case of the jireceding for example if we were to 
argue that man is a free agent on the ground that 
he is morally responsible for his actions or that his 
actions can be imputed to him or on the ground 
that vice and virtue are absolutely diflferent — in these 
cases the hysteron protevon is committed for only 
on the ground that the human will is free can man 
be viewed as a morally responsible agent and his ac 
tions be imputed to him or can the discrimination of 
vice and virtue as more than a merely accidental rela 
tion be maintained but we must pause before we 
reject a reasoning on the ground of hysteron proterem 
for the reasoning may still be valid though this logi 
cal fault be committed nay it is frequently neces 
sary for us to reason by such a regress in the very 
examjde given if we be unable to prove directly that 
the will of man is free but are able to prove that he 
is a moral agent responsible for his actions as sub

this in fact is kant’s argument from what he calls 
the categorical imperative that is from the fact of 
the unconditioned law of duty as obligatory on man 
he postulates as conditions the liberty of the human

the third law — that no circular probation is to third rui

prove must not be used as a principle for its own pro

lodge through the circle the result of which is only 
the proof of an assertion — through the circle by itself 
nothing whatever is gained for the logical develop 
ment of our knowledge but we must take care not 
to confound the connection of eegressive and pro 
gressive proofs with the tautological circle when 
in the treatment of a science out of the observed 
facts we wish to generalise universal laws we lead 
in the first place an inductive probation that ori 
certain laws there are having assured ourselves of 
the existence of these laws by this regressive process 
we then place them in theory at the head of a pro 
gressive or synthetic probation in which the facts 
again recur reversed and illustrated from the laws 
which in the antecedent process they had been em 
ployed to establish that is it is now shown why 
sioti these facts exist 

the fourth rule — no leap no gap must be made 
that is the syllogisms of which the probation is made 
up must stand in immediate or continuous connection 

¦ — may be likewise reduced to the first for here 
the only vice is that by an ellipsis of an intennediate 
link in the syllogistic chain we use a proposition which 
is actually without its proof and it is only because 
this proposition is as yet unproved that its employ 
ment is illegitimate the saltiis is therefore only a 
special case of the petitio 

the sahus is committed when the middle term of 
one of the syllogisms in a probation is not stated 
if the middle term be too manifest to require state 
ment then is the saltus not to be blamed for it is 
committed only in the expression and not in the 
thought if the middle term be not easy of dis 
covery then the saltus is a fault but if there be 


 



lectures on logic 


 


no middle term to be found then the saltus is a vice lect 
which invalidates the whole remainder of the proba 
tion the proper saltus — the real violation of this 
law is therefore when we make a transition from one 
proposition to another the two not being connected 
together as reason and consequent the vulgar 
enthymeme and the sorites do not therefore it is 
evident involve violations of this law 

the fifth eule — the scope of the probation is not fifth kui 
to be changed that is nothing is to be proved other 
than what was proposed to be proved — corresponds 
to the second of the two rules which i gave and of 
which it is only a less explicit statement it evidently aamitu of 
admits of three kinds or degrees in the first case 
the proposition to be proved is changed by the 
change of its subject or predicate into different no 
tions again the proposition may substantially re 
main the same but may be changed into one either of 
a wider or of a narrower extension — the second and 
third cases 

the first of these cases is the mulatto elenchi or pint 
transitus ad aliud genus properly so called “ when jwto 
a probation does not demonstrate what it ought to 
demonstrate it may if considered absolutely or in 
itself be valid but if considered relatively to the pro 
position which it behoves us to prove it is of no value 

we commute by this procedure the whole scope or pur 
port of the probation we desert the proper object of 
inquiry — the point in question if a person would 
prove the existence of ghosts and to this end prove 
by witness the fact of unusual noises and appear 
ances during the night he would prove something 
very different from what he proposed to establish

which too 
much if 
proved 


for this would be admitted without difficulty by those 
who still denied the apparition of ghosts it therefore 
behoved him to show that the unusual phenomena 
were those of a spirit good or bad” “ 

the two other cases — when the proposition actually 
proved is either of a smaller or of a greater extension 
than the proposition which ought to have been proved 
— are not necessarily like the preceding altogether 
irrelevant they are however compared together of 
various degrees of relevancy in the former case 
where too little is proved — here the end proposed is 
to a certain extent at least changed and the proba 
tion results in something different from what it was 
intended to accomplish for example if we propose 
to prove that sempronius is a virtuous character 
and only prove the legality of his actions we here 
prove something less than something different from 
what we professed to do for we proposed to prove 
the internal morality and not merely the external law 
fulness of his conduct such a proof is not absolutely 
invalid it is not even relatively null for the exter 
nal legality is always a concomitant of internal mor 
ality but the existence of the latter is not evinced 
by that of the former for sempronius may conform 
his actions to the law from expediency and not from 
duty 

in the other case in which there is proved too much 
the probation is lawful and only not adequate and 
precise for example if we propose to prove that the 
soul does not perish with the body and actually prove 
that its dissolution is absolutely impossible — here 
the proof is only superabundant the logical rule —

qui nimium probat nihil prohat is therefore in its 
universal or unqualified expression incorrect the 
proving too much is however often the sign of a 
saltus having been committed for example — when 
a religious enthusiast argues from the strength of his 
persuasion that he is therefore actuatal by the holy 
spirit and his views of religion consequently true — 
there is here too much proved for there is implied 
the antecedent omitted by a saltus that whoever is 
strongly persuaded of his inspiration is really inspired 
— a proposition too manifestly absurd to bear an ex 
plicit enouncement in this case the apparent too 
much is in reality a too much which when closely 
examined resolves itself into a nothing® 

we have thus terminated the consideration of pure 
or abstract logic in both its parts and now enter on 
the doctrine of modified or concrete logic

truth its character and kinds 

having now terminated the doctrine of pure or ab 
stract logic we proceed to that of modified or con 
crete logic in entering on this subject i have to 
recall to your memory what has formerly been stated 
in regard to the object which modified logic pro 
poses for consideration pure logic takes into ac 
count only the necessary conditions of thought as 
founded on the nature of the thinking process itself 
modified logic on the contrary considers the condi 
tions to which thought is subject arising from the 
empirical circumstances external and internal under 
which exclusively it is the will of our creator that 
man should manifest his faculty of thinking pure 
logic is thus exclusively conversant with the form 
modified logic is likewise occupied with the matter 
of thought and as their objects are different so 
likewise must be their ends the end of pure logic 
is formal truth — the harmony of thought with 
thought the end of modified logic is the harmony 
of thought with existence of these ends that which 
pure logic proposes is less ambitious but it is fully 
and certainly accomplished the end which modified

logic proposes is higher but it is far less perfectly lerr 
attained the problems which modified logic has to 
solve may be reduced to three ° what is truth 
and its contradictory opposite — error ° what 

are the causes of error and the impediments to truth 
by which man is beset in the employment of his facul 
ties and what are the means of their removal and 

° what are the subsidiaries by which human 
thought may be strengthened and guided in the 
exercise of its functions

if to imodified stoicheiology we refer the considera

a consideration of the means of employing thought 
not merely without error but with a certain positive 
perfection — this is what the third chapter professes 
to expound

answer the question — what is truth with its cor 
relatives — by the dictation of the following paragraph

are exerted to accomplish is truth and ccr ccruinty

or the conscious necessity of knowledge abso 
lutely excludes the admission of any opposite 
supposition where such appears admissible 
doubt and uncertainty arise if we consider 
truth by relation to the degree and kind of cer 
tainty we have to distinguish knowledge belief 
and opinion knowledge and belief differ not 
only in degree but in kind knowledge is a 
certainty founded upon insight belief is a cer 
tainty founded upon feeling the one is per 
spicuous and objective the other is obscure and 
subjective each however supposes the other 
and an assurance is said to be a knowledge or 
a belief according as the one element or the other 
preponderates opinion is the admission of 
something as true where however neither in 
sight nor feeling is so intense as to necessitate a 
perfect certainty what prevents the ailmission 
of a proposition as certain is called doubt the 
approximation of the imperfect certainty of 
opinion to the perfect certainty of knowledge or 
belief is called probability 

if we consider truth with reference to know 
ledge and to the way in which this knowledge 
arises we must distinguish empirical or a pos 
teriori from pure or a priori truth the former 
has reference to cognitions which have their 
source in the presentations of perception ex 
ternal and internal and which obtain their form

this paragraph after statiog that truth and cer lect 

tainty constitute the end of all our endeavours after l 

knowledge for only in the attainment of truth and 
certainty can we possibly attain to knowledge or 
science — i say after the statement of this manifest 
proposition — it proceeds to define what is meant by 
the two terms truth and certainty and to com 
mence with the former — truth is defined the corre 
spondence or agreement of a cognition or cognitive act 
of thought with its object 

the question — what is truth is an old and celetmth— 
brated problem it was proposed by the koman 
governor — by pontius pilate — to our saviour and it 
is a question which stiu recurs and is still keenly agi 
tated in the most recent schools of philosophy in one definition 
respect all are nearly agreed in regard to the defini 
tion of the term for all admit that by truth is under 
stood a harmony — an agreement — a correspondence 
between our thought and that which we think about 

this definition of truth we owe to the schoolmen 

“ veritas intellectus” says aquinas “est adaequatio in 
tellectus et rei secundum quod intellectus dicit esse 
quod est vel non esse quod non est” “ from the 
schoolmen this definition had been handed down to 
modern philosophers by whom it is currently em 
ployed without in general a suspicion of its origin 

it is not therefore in regard to the meaning of the 
term truth that there is any difference of opinion 
among philosophers the questions which have pro qumtions 
yoked discussion and which remain as heretofore regwding 
without a definitive solution are not whether truth be

the harmony of thought and reality but whether this 
hannony or truth be attainable and whether we pos 
sess any criterion by which we can be assured of its 
attainment considering however at present only the 
meaning of the term philosophers have divided truth 
or the harmony of thought and its object into differ 
ent species to which they have given diverse names 
but they are at one neither in the division nor in the 
nomenclature 

it is plain that for man there can only be conceived 
two kinds of truth because there are for human thought 
only two species of oly’ect for that about which we 
think must either be a thought or something which a 
thought contains on this is founded the distinction 
of formal knowledge and real knowledge — of for 
mal truth and real truth of these in their order 

i in regard to the former a thought abstracted 
from what it contains that is from its matter or what 
it is conversant about is the mere form of thought 
the knowledge of the form of thought is a formal 
knowledge and the harmony of thought with the form 
of thought is consequently formal truth now formal 
knowledge is of two kinds for it regards either the 
conditions of the elaborative faculty — the faculty 
of thought proper — or the conditions of our presen 
tations or representations of external things that is 
the intuitions of space and time the former of these 
sciences is pime logic — the science which considers 
the laws to which the understanding is astricted in its 
elaborative operations without inquiring what is the 
object — what is the matter to which tliese operations 
are applied the latter of these sciences is liathema 
tics or the science of quantity which considers the re 
lations of time and space without inquiring whether

there be any actual reality in space or time formal 
truth will therefore be of two kinds — logical and 
mathematical logical truth is the harmony or agree 
ment of our thoughts with themselves as thoughts in 
other words the correspondence of thought with the 
universal laws of thinking these laws are the object 
of pure or general logic and in these it places the cri 
terion of truth this criterion is however only the nega 
tive condition — only the conditio sine qua non of truth 
logical truth is supposed in supposing the possibuity 
of thought for all thought presents a combination the 
elements of which are repugnant or congruent but 
which cannot be repugnant and congnient at the same 
time logic might be true although we possessed no 
truth beyond its fundamental laws although we knew 
nothing of any real existence beyond the formal hypo 
thesis of its possibility 

but were the liaws of logic purely subjective that 
is were they true only for our thought alone and 
without any objective validity all human sciences 
and mathematics amcmg the rest would be purely 
subjective likewise for we are cognisant of objects 
only under the forms and rules of which logic is the 
scientific development if the true character of ob 
jective validity be universality the laws of logic are 
really of that character for these laws constrain us 
by their own authority to regard them as the univer 
sal laws not only of human thought but of universal 
reason 

the case is the same with the other formal science 
the science of quantity or mathematics without 
inquiring into the reality of existences and without 
borrowing from or attributing to them anything 
arithmetic the science of discrete quantity creates

its numbers and gcometr’’ the science of continuous 
quantity creates its figures and both operate upon 
these their objects in absolute independence of all 
external actuality the two mathematical sciences 
are dccndent for their several objects only on the 
notion of time and the notion of space — notions under 
which alone matter can be conceived as possible for 
all matter supposes space and all matter is moved in 
space and in time but to the notions of space and time 
the existence or nonexistence of matter is indifferent 
indifferent consequently to geometry and arithmetic 
so long at least as they remain in the lofty regions of 
pure speculation and do not descend to the practical 
application of their principles if matter had no exist 
ence nay if space and time existed only in our minds 
mathematics would still be true but their truth would 
be of a pmely formal and ideal character — would fur 
nish us with no knowledge of objective realities® 

so much for formal truth under its two species of 
logical and mathematical 

the other genus of truth — the end which the real 
sciences propose — is the harmony between a thought 
and its matter the real sciences are those which 
have a determinate reality for their object and which 
are conversant about existences other than the forms 
of thought the formal sciences have a superior 
certainty to the real for they are simply ideal com 
binations and they construct their objects without 
inquiring about their objective reality the real sci 
ences are sciences of fact for the point from which 
they depart is always a fact — always a presentation

real truth is therefore the correspondence of our how cu we

all that could be said in answer to such a doubt is 
that if such were true our whole nature is a lie — a 
supposition which is not without the strongest evi 
dence to be admitted and the argument is as com 
petent against the sceptic in our present condition as 
it would be were we endowed with any other con 
ceivable form of acquisitive and cognitive faculties 
but i am here trenching on what ought to be re 
served for an explanation of the criterion of truth 

such as it appears to me is the only rational divi 
sion of truth according to the different character of 
the objects to which thought is relative — into formal 
and into real truth formal truth as we have seen 
is subdivided into logical and into mathematical 
real truth might likewise be subdivided were this 
requisite into various species for example meta 
physical truth might denote the harmony of thought 
with the necessary facts of mind psychological 
truth the harmony of thought with the contingent 
facts of mind and physical truth the harmony of 
thought with the phoenomena of external experience 

it now remains to say a word in regard to the con 
fusion which has been introduced into this subject by 
the groundless distinctions and contradictions of philo 
sophers some have absurdly given the name of truth 
to the mere reality of existence altogether abstracted 
from any conception or judgment relative to it in any 
intelligence human or divine in this sense physical 
truth has been used to denote the actual existence of 
a thing some have given the name of metaphysical

truth to the congruence of the thing with its idea in lect 

the mind of the creator others again have bestowed 

the name of metaphysical truth on the mere logical 
possibility of being thought whde they have deno 
minated by logical truth the metaphysical or physical 
correspondence of thought with its objects finally 
the term moral or ethical truth has bfeen given to 
veracity or the correspondence of thought with its 
expression in this last case tnith is not as in the 
others employed in relation to thought and its object 
but to thought and its enouncement so much for the 
notion and the principal distinctions of truth 

but returning to the paragraph i take the next pie cnw 
clause which is — ‘ the criterion of truth is the neces truth 
sity determined by the laws which govern our faculties 
of knowledge and the consciousness of this necessity is 
certainty’ that the necessity of a cognition that 
is the impossibility of thinking it other than as it 
is presented — that this necessity as founded on the 
laws of thouglit is the criterion of tmth is shown 
by the circumstance that where such necessity is 
found all doubt in regard to the correspondence of 
the cognitive thought and its object must vanish 
for to doubt whether what we necessarily think in a 
certain manner actually exists as we conceive it is 
nothing less than an endeavour to think the necessary 
as the not necessary or the impossible which is con 
tradictory 

what has just been said also illustrates the truth of 
the next sentence of the paragraph — viz ‘ certainty or 
the conscious necessity of a cognition absolutely ex 
cludes the admission of any opposite supposition 

when such is found to be admissible doubt and un 
certainty arise’ this sentence requiring no explan

ation i proceed to the next — viz ‘ if we consider 
truth by relation to the degree and kind of certainty 
we have to distinguish knowledge belief and opinion 
knowledge and belief differ not only in degree but 
in kind knowledge is a certainty founded on intui 
tion belief is a certainty founded upon feeling the 
one is perspicuous and objective the other is obscure 
and subjective each however supposes the other 
and an assurance is said to be a knowledge or a belief 
according as the one element or the other prepon 
derates’ 

in reference to this passage it is necessary to say 
something in regard to the difference of knowledge 
and belief in common language the word belief is 
often used to denote an inferior degree of certainty 
we may however be equally certain of what we be 
lieve as of what we know and it has not without 
ground been maintained by many philosophers both 
in ancient and in modern times that the certainty of 
all knowledge is in its ultimate analysis resolved into 
a certainty of belief “ all things” says luther “ stand 
in a belief in a faith which we can neither see nor 
comprehend the man who would make these visible 
manifest and comprehensible has vexation and heart 
grief for his reward may the lord increase belief in 
you and in others” “ but you may perhaps think that 
the saying of luther is to be taken theologically and 
that philosophically considered all belief ought to be 
founded on knowledge not all knowledge in belief 
but the same doctrine is held even by those philo 
sophers who are the least disposed to mysticism or 
blind fiitli among these aristotle stands distin

guished he defines science strictly so culled or the 
knowledge of indubitable truths merely by the inten 
sity of our conviction or subjective assurance “ and 
on a primary and incomprehensible belief he hangs 
the whole chain of our comprehensible or mediate 
knowledge the doctrine which has been called the 
philosophy of common sense is the doctrine which 
founds all our knowledge on belief and though this 
has not been signalised the doctrine of common sense 
is perhaps better stated by the stagiiite than by 
any succeeding thinker “ what” he says “ appears 
to all men that we affirm to be and he who rejects 
this belief ttioti will assuredly advance nothing 
better worthy of credit” this passage is from his 
nicomachean ethics but in his physical treatises 
he founds in belief the knowledge we have of the re 
ality of motion and by this as a source of knowledge 
paramount to the understanding he supersedes the 
contradictions which are involved in our conception 
of motion and which had so acutely been evolved by 
the eleatic zeno in order to show that motion was 
impossible in like manner in his logical treatises 
aristotle shows that the primary or ultimate princi 
ples of knowledge must be incomprehensible for if 
comprehensible they must be comprehended in some 
higher notion and this again if not itself incompre

lect ence of which we must admit but the reasons of whose 
 existence we cannot know — we cannot tmderstand 
y but such an admission as it is not a knowledge must 
be a belief and thus it is that according to aristotle 
all our knowledge is in its root a blind a passive faith 
in other words a feeling the same doctrine was 
subsequently held by many of the acutest thinkers of 
the platon ancient times more especially among the platonists 
ptoiue and of these proclus is perhaps the philosopher in 
whose works the doctrine is turned to the best account® 
in modern times we may trace it in silent operation 
though not explicitly proclaimed or placed as the 
foimdation of a system it is found spontaneously 
recognised even by those who might be supposed the 
least likely to acknowledge it without compulsion 
iiumc hume for example against whose philosophy the 
doctrine of common sense was systematically ar 
rayed himself pointed out the weapons by which his 
adversaries subsequently assailed his scepticism for 
he himself was possessed of too much philosophical 
acuteness not to perceive that the root of knowledge 
is belief thus in his inquiry he says — “ it seems 
evident that men are carried by a natural instinct 
or prepossession to repose faith in their senses and 
that without any reasoning or even almost before the 
use of reason we always suppose an external universe 
which depends not on our preception but would exist 
though we and every sensible creature were absent or 
annihilated even the animal creation are governed 
by a like opinion and preserve this belief — the belief 
of external objects in all their thoughts designs and 
actions this very table which we see

external to our mind which perceives it” “ 

but on the other hand the manifestation of this the ii 
belief necessarily involves knowledge for we cannot iiicitn 
believe without some consciousness or knowledge of knowledge 
the belief and consequently without some conscious f 
ness or knowledge of the object of the belief now 
the immediate consciousness of an object is called an intuition

the consideration however of the relation of belief tti qu

except in so far as it is necessary to explain the nature nd know 
of truth and error it is altogether a metaphysical por m™t 
discussion and one of the most difficult problems of 
which metaphysics attempts the solution 

the remainder of the paragraph contains the state 
ment of certain distinctions and the definition of cer 
tain terms which it was necessary to signalise but 
which do not require any commentary for their illus 
tration the only part that might have required an 
explanation is the distinction of truth into pure or 
a pinoi’i and into empirical or a posteriori the 
explanation of this division has been already given 
more than once in the course of the lectures but the

have come within our sphere of observation our whole 
knowledge of and from these objects might or might 
not exist — it is merely accidental or contingent but 
as our knowledge of individual objects affords the 
possibility as supplying the whole contents of our 
generalised or abstracted notions our generalised or 
abstracted notions are consequently not more neces 
sary to thought than the particular observations out of 
which they are constructed for example every horse 
i have seen i might not have seen and i feel no more 
necessity to think the reality of a horse than the 
reality of a hippogriff i can therefore easily anni 
hilate in thought the existence of the whole species 
i can suppose it not to be — not to have been the 
case is the same with every other notion which is 
mediately or immediately the datum of observation 
we can think away each and every part of the know 
ledge we have derived from experience our whole em 
pirical knowledge is therefore a merely accidental 
possession of the mind 

but there are notions in the mind of a very different 
character — notions which we cannot but think if we 
think at all these therefore are notions necessary 
to the mind and as necessary they cannot be the 
product of experience for example i perceive some 
thing to begin to be i feel no necessity to think 
that this thing must be at all but thinking it exist 
ent i cannot but think that it has a cause the no 
tion or rather the judgment of cause and effect is 
therefore necessary to the mind if so it cannot be 
derived from experience

xxviii 

 commutation of what is subjective with what is ob 
jective in thought ° from the contradiction of a 
supposed knowledge with its laws or ° from a 
want of adequate activity in our cognitive faculties’ 
er™r “ in the first place we have seen that truth is the 

wbt 

agreement of a thought with its object now as 
error is the opposite of truth — error must necessarily 
consist in a want of this agreement in the second 
place it has been shown that the criterion or stand 
ard of tnith is the necessity founded on the laws of 
our cognitive faculties and from this it follows that 
the essential character f error must be either that it 
is not founded on these laws or that it is repugnant to 
them but these two alternatives may be viewed as 
only one for inasmuch as in the former case the 
judgment remains undecided and can make no pre 
tence to certainty it may be thrown out of ac 
count no less than in the latter where as positively 
contradictory of the laws of knowledge it is neces 
ajmril sarily false of these statements the first that is the 
nonagreement of a notion with its object is error 
viewed on its material side and as a notion is the 
common product — the joint result afforded by the 
reciprocal action of object and subject it is evident 
that whatever the notion contains not correspondent 
to the object must be a contribution by the thinking 
subject alone and we are thus warranted in saying 
that material error consists in the commuting of 
what is subjective with what is objective in thought 
in other words in mistaking an ideal illusion for a 
am formal real representation the second of these statements 
that is the incongruence of the supposed cognition 
with tlie laws of knowledge is error viewed on its

formal side now here the question at once presents lect 

 xxviil 

itself — how can an act of cognition contradict its 

own laws the answer is that it cannot and error aribei from 
when more closely scrutinised is found not so much ° 
to consist in the contradictory activity of our cogni “c ci 
tive faculties as in their want of actiuty and this ““ 
may be in consequence of one or other of two causes 

for it may arise from some other mental power — the 
will for example superseding — taking the place of 
the defective cognition or by its intenser force turn 
ing it aside and leading it to a false result or it may 
arise from some want of relative perfection in the ob 
ject so that the cognitive faculty is not determined by 
it to the requisite degree of action 

“ what is actually thought cannot but be correctly 
thought error first commences when thinking is re 
mitted and can in fact only gain admission in virtue 
of the truth which it contains — every error is a per 
verted truth hence des cartes “ is justified in the 
establishment of the principle — that we would never 
admit the false for the true if we would only give 
assent to what we clearly and distinctly apprehend — 

‘nihil nos unquam falsum pro vero admissuros si 
tantum iis assensum praebeamus quse dare et dis 
tincte percipimus’” in this view the saying of the 
roman poet — 

“ nam nequo decipitur ratio ncc decipit unquam” y 

— is no longer a paradox for the condition of error 
is not the activity of intelligence but its inactivity 

so much for the first part of the paragraph the er 
second is — ‘ error is to be discriminated from ignor from ignor

absurdity on the other what has now been said of 

the influence of society at large is true also of the 
lesser societies which it contains au of which impose 
with a stronger or feebler — a wider or more contracted 
authority certain received opinions upon the faith of 
the members hence it is that whatever has once 
obtained a recognition in any society large or small 
is not rejected when the reasons on which it was 
originally admitted have been proved erroneous it 
continues even for the reason that it is old and has 
been accepted to be accepted still and the title which 
was originally defective becomes valid by continu 
ance and prescription 

but opposed to this cause of error from the preju prejudice 
dice in favour of the old there is the other directly the new 
the reverse — the prejudice in favour of the new 

this prejudice may be in part at least the result of 
sympathy and fellowfeeling this is the cause why 
new opinions however erroneous if they once obtain 
a certain number of converts often spread with a 
rapidity and to an extent which after their futility 
has been ultimately shown can only be explained on 
the principle of a kind of intellectual contagion but 
the principal cause of the prejudice in favour of 
novelty lies in the passions and the consideration of 
these does not belong to the class of causes with 
which we are at present occupied 

connected with and composed of both these preju prdice 
dices — that in favour of the old and that in favour of authority 
the new — there is the prejudice of learned authority

of the human intellect so often have they likewise 
afforded the occasion of checking its advancement 
and of turning it from the straight path of improve 
ment not that this result is to be imputed as a re 
proach to them but simply because it is of the native 
of man to be so affected the views which influenced 
these men of genius and which consequently lie at 
the foundation of their works are rarely comprehended 
in their totality by those who have the names of these 
authors most frequently in their mouths the many 
do not concern themselves to seize the ideal which a 
philosopher contemplated and of which his actual 
works are only the imperfect representations they 
appropriate to themselves only some of his detached 
apophthegms and propositions and of these compound 
as they best can a sort of system suited to their un 
derstanding and which they employ as a talisman in 
their controversies with others as their reason is 
thus a captive to authority and therefore unable to 
exert its native freedom they consequently catch up 
the true and the false without discrimination and 
remain always at the point of progress where they 
had been placed by their leaders in their hands a 
system of living truths becomes a mere petrified or 
ganism and they require that the whole science shall 
become as dead and as cold as their own idol such 
was plato’s doctrine in the hands of the platonists 
such was aristotle’s philosophy in the hands of the 
schoolmen and the history of modern systems affords 
equally the same result”®

the end of his existence in society he is wisely fur 
nished with a disposition to imitate those among 
whom his lot is cast and thus to conform himself to 
whatever section of human society he may by birth 
belong or of which he may afterwards become a 
member the education we receive nay the very 
possibility of receiving education at all supposes to a 
certain extent the passive infusion of foreign and tra 
ditionary opinions for as man is compelled to think 
much earlier than he is able to think for himself — all 
education necessarily imjioses on him many opinions 
which whether in themselves true or false are in re 
ference to the recipient only prejudices and it is 
even only a small number of mankind who at a later 
period are able to bring these obtruded opinions to 
the test of reason and by a free exercise of their own 
intelligence to reject them if found false or to acknow 
ledge them if proved true 

but while the mass of mankind thus remain during 
their whole lives only the creatures of the accidental 
circumstances which have concurred to form for them 
their habits and beliefs the few who are at last able 
to form opinions for themselves are still dependent 
in a great measure on the unreasoning judgment

affection is that state of mind in which the feel expiic

the intellect is impeded in its endeavour to think an niuo

tumbling and tossing of doubt and consultation 
than to set up its rest and to acquiesce in whatever 
shall happen after the die is thrown few passions

remedy precipitation is no incurable disease there is for 
it one sure and simple remedy if properly applied 
it is only required to speak with confucius manfully 
to restrain the wild horse of precipitancy by the curb 
of consideration — to weigh the reasons of decision 
each and all in the balance of cool investigation — not 
to allow ourselves to decide imtil a clear conscious

in the second place “ sloth is likewise a cause of sioth

is a cause of error extremely frequent and one of 
which we are ourselves less aware and which is less 
notorious to others we feel it fatiguing to continue 
an investigation therefore we do not pursue it but 
as it is mortifying to think that we have laboured in

have succeeded by the influence of this disposition 
it often happens that after having rejected what first

and a third time what subsequently turned up be 
cause not sufficiently applicable or certain we get 
tired of the investigation and perhaps put up with 
the fourth suggestion which is not better haply even 
worse than the preceding and this simply because it 
has come into the mind when more exhausted and less 
scrupulous than it was at the commencement” “ “ the sener

wishes what he undertakes to be easy as often as 
you attempt anything compare together yourself the 
end which you propose and the means by which it is 
to be accomplished for the repentance of an un 
finished work will make you rash and here it is of 
consequence whether a man be of a fervid or of a

question of probable reasoning that is where the

be those alone on which differences of opinion may 
arise and are consequently those alone which re

and here the passion operates in two ways in the 
first place it tends so to determine the associations of 
thought that only those media of proof are suggested 
or called into consciousness which support the conclu 
sion to which the passion tends in the second place 
if the media of proof by which a counter conclusion is 
supported are brought before the mind still the mind 
is influenced by the passion to look on their reality 
with doubt and if such cannot be questioned to 
undervalue their inferential importance whereas it is 
moved to admit without hesitation those media of 
proof which favour the conclusion in the interest of 
our hope or fear and to exaggerate the cogency with 
which they establish this result either passion looks 
exclusively to a single end and exclusively to the 
means by which that single end is accomplished 
thus the sanguine temperament or the mind under 
the habitual predominance of hope sees only and 
magnifies all that militates in favour of the wished 
for consummation which alone it contemplates 
whereas the melancholic temperament or the mind 
under the habitual predominance of fear is wholly 
occupied sdth the dreaded issue views only what 
tends to its fulfilment while it exaggerates the pos 
sible into the probable the probable into the certain 
thus it is that whatever conclusion we greatly hope or 
greatly fear to that conclusion we are disposed to 
leap and it has become almost proverbial that men

gratitude and other conciliatory affections “we do 
not limit our attachment to the persons of our friends 
— we love in a certain sort all that belongs to them 
and as men generally manifest suflbcient ardour in 
support of their opinions we are led insensibly by a 
kind of sympathy to credit to approve and to defend 
these also and that even more passionately than our 
friends themselves we bear affection to others for 
various reasons the agreement of tempers of inclina 
tions of pursuits their appearance their manners 
their virtue the partiality which they have shown to 
us the services we have received at their hands and 
many other particular causes determine and direct our 
love 

“ it is observed by the great malebranche® that if 
any of our friends — any even of those we are disposed 
to love — advance an opinion we forthwith lightly 
allow ourselves to be persuaded of its truth this 
opinion we accept and support without troubling our 
selves to inquire whether it be conformable to fact

we should confess our having erred is the condition 
which many insist on stipulating above all that 
resolve of mind is difficult which is ready to sur 
render all fond convictions and is prepared to re 
commence investigation the moment that a funda 
mental error in the former system of belief has been 
detected these are the principal grounds why 
among men opinion is so widely separated from 
opinion and why the clearest demonstration is so 
frequently for a season frustrated of victory 

 xcvi against the errors which arise from 
the affections there may be given the three 
following rules — 

° when the error has arisen from the influ

freed as far as possible from passion and the 
process of inquiry to be recommenced as soon 
as the requisite tranquillity has been restored 

° avhen the error has arisen from a relaxed 
enthusiasm for knowledge we must reanimate 
this interest by a vivid representation of the 
paramount dignity of truth and of the lofty 
destination of our intellectual nature 

° in testing the accuracy of our judgments 
we must be particularly suspicious of those 
results which accord with our private inclina 
tions and predominant tendencies

i now go on to the second head of the class of errors 
founded on the natural constitution the acquired 
habits and the reciprocal relations of our cognitive 
and affective powers that is to the causes of error 
which originate in the weakness or disproportioned 
strength of one or more of our faculties of knowledge 
themselves 

here in the first place i might consider the errors 
which have arisen from the limited nature of the 
human intellect in general — or rather from the mis 
takes that have been made by philosophers in denying 
or not taking this limited nature into account the 
illustration of this subject is one which is relative to

not to logic but to metaphysics i shall not therefore 
do more than simply indicate at present what it will 
 piiiio be proper at another season fully to explain it is 
acijuil manifest that if the human mind be limited — if it 
only knows as it is conscious and if it be only con 
scious as it is conscious of contrast and opposition — 
of an ego and nonego — if this supposition i say be 
correct it is evident that those philosophers are in 
error who virtually assume that the human mind is 
unlimited that is that the human mind is ciipable ot 
a knowledge superior to consciousness — a cognition 
in which knowledge and existence — the ego and 
nonego — god and the creature — are identical that 
is of an act in which the mind is the absolute and 
knows the absolute this philosophy the statement 
of which as here given it would require a long com 
mentary to make you understand is one which has 
for many years been that dominant in germany it 
is called the philosophy of the absolute or the phi 
losophy of absolute identity this system of which 
schelling and hegel are the great representatives errs 
by denying the limitation of human intelligence with 
out proof and by boldly building its edifice on this 
gratuitous negation®

of tliu finit not in actually postulating the infinity of mind but 
 in taking only a onesided view of its finitude it is

but of neither of which repugnant opposites are we 
able to represent to our mind the possibility® to illustrated 
take one example out of many we cannot construe ufthja” 
to the mind as possible the absolute commencement torien —the 
of time but we are equally unable to think the pos commence 
sibility of the counter alternative — its infinite or ab the intiuitc 
solute noncommencement in other words the infinite men cement 
regress of time now it is evident that if we looked 
merely at the one of these contradictory opposites and 
argued thus — whatever is inconceivable is impos 
sible the absolute commencement of time is incon 
ceivable therefore the absolute commencement ot 
time is impossible but on the principles of contra 
diction and excluded middle one or other of two op 
posite contradictories must be true therefore as the 
absolute commencement of time is impossible the ab 
solute or infinite noncommencement of time is neces 
sary — i say it is evident that this reasoning would 
be incompetent and onesided because it might be 
converted for by the same onesided process the 
opposite conclusion might be drawn in favour of the 
absolute commencement of time 

now the unilateral and incompetent reasoning tic imc 
which i have here supposed in the case of time is cxcmpirned 
one of which the necessitarian is guilty in his argu lhoneju 
ment to prove the impossibility of human volitions 
being free he correctly lays down as the founda

mencement of volition that is of a volition which is 
a cause but is not itself qua cause an effect ° 
that the absolute commencement of volition or of 
aught else cannot be conceived that is cannot be 
directly or positively thought as possible so far he is 
correct but when he goes on to apply these princi 
ples by arguing and be it observed this syllogism 
lies at the root of all the reasonings for necessity 
whatever is inconceivable is impossible but the sup 
position of the absolute commencement of volition is 
inconceivable therefore uie supposition of the abso 
lute commencement of volition the condition of free 
will is impossible — we may here demur to the sump 
tion and ask him — can he positively conceive the 
opposite contradictory of the absolute commencement 
that is an infinite series of relative noncommence 
ments if he answers as he must that he cannot 
we may again ask him — by what right he assumed 
as a selfevident axiom for his sumption the proposi 
tion — that ivhatcvcr is inconceivable is impossible or 
by what right he could subsume his minor premise 
when by his own confession he allows that the oppo 
site contradictory of his minor premise that is the 
very proposition he is apagogically proving is like 
wise inconceivable and therefore on the principle of 
his sumption likewise imjwssible 

amiintiio the same inconsequence would equally apply to 
ixrtaiim file libertarian who should attempt to prove that 
hwuifof freewill must be allowed on the ground that its 
irw wiii contradictory opposite is impossible because incon

conceivable it is only when the libertarian descends 
to arguments drawn from the fact of the moral law 
and its conditions that he is able to throw in reasons 


which incline the balance in his favour 

on these matters i however at present only touch 
in order to show you under what head of error these 
reasonings would natiually fall 

leaving therefore or adjourning the consideration 
of the imbecility of the human intellect in general 
i shall now take into view as a source of logical error 
the weakness or disproportioned strength of the sev

partly of certain higher powers in virtue of which he 
enters into the rank of intelligent existences namely 
the elaborative and regulative faculties — it will be 
proper to consider the powers of these two classes 
severally in succession in so far as they may afford the 
causes or occasions of error 

of the lower class the first faculty in order is the itiio 
presentative or acquisitive faculty this as youciw—

perception or external sense the latter is selfcon

h xcvii when aught is presented through the 
outer senses there are two conditions necessary 
for its adequate perception — ° the relative or 
gans must be present and in a condition to dis 
charge their functions and ° the objects them 
selves must bear a certain relation to these or 
gans so that the latter shall be suitably affected 
and thereby the former suitably apprehended 
it is possible therefore that partly through the 
altered condition of the organs partly through 
the altered situation of the objects dissimilar 
presentations of the same and similar presenta 
tions of different objects may be the result® 


eipiic “in the first place without the organs specially 
clditiom subservient to external perception — without the eye 
sensible perceptions of a precise and de 
eittro’r terminate character such for example as colour or 
percepuon are not competent to man in the second 

place to perform their functions these organs must be 
in a healthy or normal state for if this condition be 
not fulfilled the presentations which they furnish are 
null incomplete or false but in the third place 
even if the organs of sense are sound and perfect the 
objects to be presented and perceived must stand to 
these organs in a certain relation — must bear to them 
a certain proportion for otherwise the objects can 
not be presented at au or cannot be perceived without

illusion the sounds for example which we are to lect 
hear must neither he too high nor too low in quality 

the bodies which we are to see must neither be too ilufoiu of 
near nor too distant — must neither be too feebly nor “ 
too intensely illuminated in relation to the second 
condition there are given in consequence of the al 
tered state of the organs on the one hand different 
presentations of the same object — thus to a person 
who has waxed purblind his friend appears as an utter 
stranger the eye now presenting its objects with less 
clearness and distinctness on the other hand there 
are given the same or undistinguishably similar presen 
tations of different objects — thus to a person in the 
jaundice all things are presented yellow in relation 
to the third condition from the altered position of 
objects there are in like manner determined on the 
one hand different presentations of the same objects 

— as when the stick which appears straight in the air 
appears crooked when partially immersed in water and 
on the other hand identical presentations of different 
objects as when a man and a horse appear in the dis 
tance to be so similar that the one cannot be discrim 
inated from the other in all these cases these illu 
sions are determined — illusions which may easily be 
come the occasions of false judgments” 

“ in regard to the detection of such illusions and putiom 
obviating the error to which they lead it behoves ustohed 
to take the following precautions we must in the sioiu of tbo 
first place examine the state of the orgam if found obviating 

defective we must endeavour to restore it to perfec to which

the extent and nature of the evil in order to be upon

guard in regard to quality and degree of the false 
presentation 

“ in the second place we must examine the relative 
situation of the object and if this be not accommo 
dated to the organ we must either obviate the dis 
proportion and remove the media which occasion the 
illusion or repeat the observation under different cir 
cumstances compare these and thus obtain the means 
of making an ideal abstraction of the disturbing 
causes” “ 

in regard to the other presentative faculty — the 
faculty of selfconsciousness — internal perception 
or internal sense as we know less of the material 
conditions which modify its action we are unable to 
ascertain so precisely the nature of the illusions of 
which it may be the sourca in reference to this sub 
ject you may take the following paragraph 

pw xcvm it xcviii the faculty of selfconsciousness or 
¦ciousncu internal sense is subject to various changes 
•ourco of which either modify our apprehensions of ob 

jects or influence the manner in which we judge 
 concerning them in so far therefore as false 
judgments are thus occasioned selfconsciousness 
is a source of error 

expiic it is a matter of ordinary observation that the 
spifcon vivacity w’ith which we are conscious of the various 
varies iu phsenomena of mind differs not only at different times 
inumuy different states of health and in different degrees 
of mental ffeshness and exhaustion but at the same

time differs in regard to the different kinds of these 
phsenomena themselves according to the greater or 
less intensity of this faculty the same thoughts of 
which we are conscious are at one time clear and 
distinct at another obscure and confused at one 
time we are almost wholly incapable of reflection and 
every act of selfattention is forced and irksome and 
differences the most marked pass unnoticed while 
at another our selfconsciousness is alert all its appli 
cations pleasing and the most faint and fugitive 
phenomena arrested and observed on one occasion 
selfconsciousness as a reflective cognition is strong 
on another all reflection is extinguished in the inten 
sity of the direct consciousness of feeling or desire in 
one state of mind our representations are feeble in 
another they are so lively that they are mistaken for 
external realities our selfconsciousness may thus 
be the occasion of frequent error for according to its 
various modifications we may form the most opposite 
judgments concerning the same things — pronouncing 
them for example now to be agreeable now to be 
disagreeable according as our internal sense is vari 
ously affected 

the next is the retentive or conservative faculty 
— memory strictly so called in reference to which i 
give you the following paragraph 

t xcix memory or the conservative faculty 
is the occasion of error both when too weak and 
when too strong when too weak the complement 
of cognitions which it retains is small and indis 
tinct and the understanding or elaborative 
faculty is consequently unable adequately to

judge concerning the similarity and differences 
of its representations and concepts when too 
strong the understanding is overwhelmed with 
the multitude of acquired cognitions simultane 
ously forced upon it so that it is imable calmly 
and deliberately to compare and discriminate 
these a 

that both these extremes — that both the insuffi 
cient and the superfluous vigour of the conservative 
faculty are severally the sources of error it will not 
require many observations to make apparent 

in regard to a feeble memory it is manifest that a 
multitude of false judgments must inevitably arise 
from an incapacity in this faculty to preserve the 
observations committed to its keeping in conse 
quence of this incapacity if a cognition be not wholly 
lost it is lost at least in part and the circumstances 
of time place persons and things confounded with 
each other for example — i may recollect the tenor 
of a passage i have read but from defect of memory 
may attribute to one author what really belongs to 
another thus a botanist may judge two diflferent 
plants to be identical in species having forgotten the 
diflerential characters by which they were discrimin 
ated or he may hold the same plant to be two diflferent 
species having examined it at diflferent times and 
places 

though nothing could be more erroneous than a 
general and unqualified decision that a great memory 
is incompatible with a sound judgment yet it is an 
observation confirmed by the experience of all ages

and countries not only that a great memory is no 
condition of high intellectual talent but that great 
memories are very frequently found in combination 
with comparatively feeble powers of thought® the 
truth seems to be that where a vigorous memory is 
conjoined with a vigorous intellect not only does the 
force of the subsidiary faculty not detract from the 
strength of the principal but on the contrary tends 
to confer on it a still higher power whereas when 
the inferior faculty is disproportionately strong that 
so far from nourishing and corroborating the superior 
it tends to reduce this facrdty to a lower level than 
that at which it would have stood if united with a 
less overpowering subsidiary the greater the maga 
zine of various knowledge which the memory contains 
the better for the understanding provided the un 
derstanding can reduce this various knowledge to 
order and subjection “ a great memory is the prin 
cipal condition of bringing before the mind many 
different representations and notions at once or in 
rapid succession this simultaneous or nearly simul 
taneous presence disturbs however the tranquil com 
parison of a small number of ideas which if it shall 
judge aright the intellect must contemplate with a 
fixed and steady attention” now where an intellect 
possesses the power of concentration in a high degree 
it will not be harassed in its meditations by the offi 
cious intrusions of the subordinate faculties however 
vigorous these in themselves may be but will control 
their vigour by exhausting in its own operations the

whole applicable energy of mind whereas where 
the inferior is more vigorous than the superior it will 
in like manner engross in its own function the dis 
posable amount of activity and overwhelm the prin 
cipal faculty with materials many even in proportion 
as it is able to elaborate few this appears to me the 
reason why men of strong memories are so often men 
of proportionally weak judgments and why so many 
errors arise from the possession of a faculty the per 
fection of which ought to exempt them from many 
mistaken judgments 

as to the remedy for these opposite extremes the 
former — the imbecility of memory — can only be allevi 
ated by invigorating the capacity of retention through 
mnemonic exercises and methods the latter — the in 
ordinate vigour of memory — by cultivating the under 
standing to the neglect of the conservative faeulty 
it will likewise be necessary to be upon our guard 
against the errors originating in these counter sources 
in the one case distrusting the accuracy of the facts 
in the other the accuracy of their elaboration 

the next faculty is the reproductive this when 
its operation is voluntarily exerted is called recollec 
tion or reminiscence when it energises spontane 
ously or without volition it is called suggestion the 
laws by which it is governed in either case but espe 
cially in the latter are called the laivs of mental 
associaiion this reproductive faculty like the 
retentive is the cause of error both if its vigour be 
defective or if it be too strong i shall consider re 
collection and suggestion severally and apart in 
regard to the former i give you the following para

 c the reproductive faculty in so far leit 
as it is voluntarily exercised as lminiscence 

becomes a source of error as it is either too 
sluggish or too prompt precisely as the reten 
tive faculty combined with which it constitutes 
memory in the looser signification 

it is necessary to say very little in special reference fpiua 
to reminiscence for what was said in regard to the rctninin 
conservative faculty or memory proper in its higher iu umiu 
vigour was applicable to and in fact supposed a cor 
responding degree of the reproductive for however 
great may be the mass of cognitions retained in the 
mind that is out of consciousness but potentially 
capable of being called into consciousness these can 
never of themselves oppress the understanding by 
their simultaneous crowding or rapid succession if 
the faculty by which they are revoked into conscious 
ness be inert whereas if this revocative faculty be 
comparatively alert and vigorous a smaller magazine 
of retained cognitions may suffice to harass the intel 
lect with a ceaseless supply of materials too profuse 
for its capacity of elaboration 

on the other hand the inactivity of our recouec it incu 
tion is a source of error precisely as the weakness of 
our memory proper for it is of the same effect in 
relation to our judgments whether the cognitions re 
quisite for a decision be not retained in the mind or 
whether being retained they are not recalled into 
consciousness by reminiscence 

in regard to suggestion or the reproductive faculty 
operating spontaneously that is not in subservience 
to an act of will — i shall give you the following

if cl as our cognitions feelings and desires 
are connected together by what are called the 
laws of association and as each link in the 
chain of thought suggests or awakens into con 
sciousness some other in conformity to these 
laws — these laws as they bestow a strong sub 
jective connection on thoughts and objects of a 
wholly arbitrary union frequently occasion great 
confusion and error in our judgments 

“ even in methodical thinking we do not connect 
all our thoughts intentionally and rationally but 
many press forward into the train either in conse 
quence of some external impression or in virtue of 
certain internal relations which however are not of a 
logical dependency thus thoughts tend to suggest 
each other which have reference to things of which 
we were previously cognisant as coexistent or as im 
mediately consequent which have been apprehended 
as bearing a resemblance to each other or which have 
stood together in reciprocal and striking contrast 
this connection though precarious and nonlogical is 
thus however governed by certain laws which have 
been called the laivs of association” “ these laws 
which i have just enumerated viz the law of co 
existence or simultaneity the law of continuity or 
immediate succession the law of similarity and the

one general law which i would call the law of redin

whatever has previously formed a part of one total 
act of consciousness tends when itself recalled into

consciousness to reproduce along with it the other lect 
parts of that original whole but though these tend 
encies be denominated laws the influence which they 
exert though often strong and sometimes irresistible 
is only contingent for it frequently happens that 
thoughts which have previously stood to each other in 
one or other of the four relations do not suggest each 
other the laws of association stand therefore on 
a very difierent footing from the laws of logical con 
nection but those laws of association contingent 
though they be exert a great and often a very perni 
cious influence upon thought inasmuch as by the in 
voluntary intrusion of representations into the mental 
chain which are wholly irrelevant to the matter in 
hand there arises a perplexed and redundant tissue 
of thought into which false characters may easily 
find admission and in which true characters may 
easily be overlooked but this is not all for by 
being once blended together in our consciousness 
things really distinct in their nature tend again natu 
rally to reassociate and at every repetition of this 
conjunction this tendency is fortified and their mu 
tual suggestion rendered more certain and irresistible 

it is in virtue of this principle of association and influence 
custom that things are clothed by us with the preca tion in 
rious attributes of deformity or beauty and some tmio 
philosophers have gone so far as to maintain that our 
principles of taste are exclusively dependent on the 
accidents of association but if this be an exagger 
ation it is impossible to deny that association en 
joys an extensive jurisdiction in the empire of taste 
and in particular that fashion is almost wholly sub 
ject to its control

quoted 


on this subject i may quote a few sentences from 
the first volume of mr stewart’s elements “ in mat 
ters of taste the efiects which we consider are pro 
duced on the mind itself and are accompanied either 
with pleasure or with pain hence the tendency to 
casual association is much stronger than it commonly 
is with respect to physical events and when such 
associations are once formed as they do not lead to 
any important inconvenience similar to those which 
result from physical mistakes they are not so likely 
to be corrected by mere experience unassisted by 
study to this it is owing that the influence of asso 
ciation on our judgments concerning beauty and de 
formity is still more remarkable than on our specula 
tive conclusions a circumstance which has led some 
philosophers to suppose that association is sufficient 
to account for the origin of these notions and that 
there is no such thing as a standard of taste founded 
on the principles of the human constitution but this 
is undoubtedly pushing the theory a great deal too 
far the association of ideas can never account for 
the origin of a new notion or of a pleasure essentially 
difierent from au the others which we know it may 
indeed enable us to conceive how a thing indifferent 
in itself may become a source of pleasure by being 
connected in the mind with something else which is 
naturally agreeable but it presupposes in every in 
stance the existence of those notions and those feel 
ings which it is its province to combine insomuch 
that i apprehend it will be found wherever associa 
tion produces a change in our judgments on matters 
of taste it does so by cooperating with some natural 
principle of the mind and implies the existence of 
certain original sources of pleasure and uneasiness

“ a mode of dress wliich at first appeared awk 
ward acquires in a few weeks or months the appear 
ance of elegance by being accustomed to see it 
worn by those whom we consider as models of taste 
it becomes associated with the agreeable impressions 
which we receive from the ease and grace and refine 
ment of their manners when it pleases by itself the 
effect is to be ascribed not to the object actually be 
fore us but to the impressions with which it has been 
generally connected and which it naturally recalls to 
the mind 

“ this observation points out the cause of the per 
petual vicissitudes in dress and in everything whose 
chief recommendation arises from fashion it is evi 
dent that os far as the agreeable effect of an ornament 
arises from association the effect wiu continue only 
while it is confined to the higher orders when it is 
adopted by the multitude it not only ceases to be 
associated with ideas of taste and refinement but it is 
associated with ideas of affectation absurd imitation 
and vulgarity it is accordingly laid aside by the 
higher orders who studiously avoid every circum 
stance in external appearance which is debased by low 
and common use and they are led to exercise their 
invention in the introduction of some new peculiari 
ties which first become fashionable then common and 
last of all ai’e abandoned as vulgar” “ 

“ our moral judgments too may be modified and 
even perverted to a certain degree in consequence of 
the operation of the same principle in the same 
manner in which a person who is regarded as a model 
of taste may introduce by his example an absurd or 
fantastical dress so a man of splendid virtues may

insensibly associating the notions of certain intellec 
tual or moral qualities with certain corporeal charac 
ters this is the reason why persons of a decided 
physiognomy please or displease us more than others 
for a physiognomy is only an assemblage of characters 
with which we have associated notions which are not 
suggested without an accompaniment of satisfaction 
or disgust it is not therefore to be marvelled at that 
we judge men according to their physiognomy and 
that we sometimes feel towards them at first sight 
aversion or inclination in consequence of these 
associations we are often vehemently prepossessed in 
favour of certain individuals and no less violently 
disposed against others it is because all that strikes 
us in our friends or in our enemies is associated with 
the agreeable or the disagreeable feeling which we 
severally experience and because the faults of the 
former borrow always something pleasing from their 
amiable qualities whereas the amiable qualities of 
the latter seem always to participate of their vices 
hence it is that these associations exert a powerful 
influence on our whole conduct they foster our love 
or hatred enhance our esteem or contempt excite 
our gratitude or indignation and produce those sym

break through the enchanted circle within which cus

accomplishment of this end we are greatly aided by 
the study of man under the various circumstances 
which have concurred in modifying his intellectual

these ages and countries are consequently distin

is the source of errors which i shall comprise in the 
following paragraph

w’hen it is too languid and when it is too vigor 
ous in the former case the object is represent

ideal representation affords the illusive appear 
ance of a sensible presentation 

a strong imagination that is the power of holding 
up any ideal object to the mind in clear and steady 
colours is a faculty necessary to the poet and to the 
artist but not to them alone it is almost equally 
requisite for the successful cultivation of every scien

different in the character of its representations it 
may well be doubted whether aristotle did not pos

vigour and perfection of this faculty is seen not so 
much in the representation of individual objects and 
fragmentary sciences as in the representation of sys

modern times on the contrary the reverse is true 
and we are disposed to look more to the obtrusive qua 
lities of details than to the keeping and unison of a 
whole our works of art are in general like kinds 
of assorted patchwork — not systems of parts all 
subdued in conformity to one ideal totality but co 
ordinations of independent fragments among which 
a seldom comes amiss the rea 

son of this difference in taste seems to bo what at first 
sight may seem the reverse that in antiquity not the 
reason but the imagination was the more vigorous — 
that the imagination was able to represent simultane 
ously a more comprehensive system and thus the 
several parts being regarded and valued only as con 
ducive to the general result — these parts never ob 
tained that individual importance which would have 
fallen to them had they been only created and only 
considered for themselves now this power of repre 
senting to the mind a complex system in all its bear 
ings is not less requisite to the philosopher than to 
the poet though the representation be different in 
kind and the nature of the philosophic representa 
tions as not concrete and palpable like the poetical 
supposes a more arduous operation and therefore 
even a more vigorous faculty but imagination in 
the one case and in the other requires in proportion 
to its own power a powerful intellect for imagina

cuity of the kepresentative faculty it is not difficult ierx 
to conceive how this imbecility may become a cause 
of erroneous judgment the elaborative faculty in 
order to judge requires an object — requires certain 
differences to be given now if the imagination be ‘‘° 
weak and languid the objects represented by it will 
be given in such confusion and obscurity that their 
differences are either null or evanescent and judgment 
thus rendered either impossible or possible only with 
the probability of error in these circumstances to 
secure itself from failure the intellect must not at 
tempt to rise above the actual presentations of sense 
it must not attempt any ideal analysis or synthesis — 
it must abandon all free and selfactive elaboration 
and all hope of a successful cultivation of knowledge 

again in regard to the opposite errors those arising it 
from the disproportioned vivacity of imagination — ti’mur 
these are equally apparent in this case the renewed ‘““y 
or newlymodified representations make an equal im 
pression on the mind as the original presentations 
and are consequently liable to be mistaken for these 

even during the perception of real objects a too lively 
imagination mingles itself with the observation which 
it thus corrupts and falsifies thus arises what is 
logically called the vitium suhreptionis this is fre 
quently seen in those pretended observations made by 
theorists in support of their hypotheses in which if 
even the possibility be left for imagination to inter 
fere imagination is sure to fill up all that the senses 
may leave vacant in this case the observers are at

in regard to the remedies for these defects of the

alleviation that can be proposed for a feeble imagina 
tion is to animate it by the contemplation and study 
of those works of art which are the products of a strong 
phantasy and which tend to awaken in the student a 
corresponding energy of that faculty on the other 
hand a too powerful imagination is to be quelled and 
regulated by abstract thinking and the study of phi 
losophical perhaps of mathematical science® 

the faculty which next follows is the elaborative 
faculty comparison or the faculty of relations 
this is the understanding in its three functions of 
conception judgment and reasoning on this fa 
culty take the following paragraph 

it cm tlie affections and the lower cog 
nitive faculties afford the sources and occasions 
of error but it is the elaborative faculty un 
derstanding comparison or judgment which 
truly errs this faculty does not however err 
from strength or overactivity but from inac 
tion and this inaction arises either from natural 
weakness from want of exercise or from the im 
potence of attention 

i formerly observed that error does not lie in the 
conditions of our higher faculties themselves and that 
these faculties are not by their own laws determined 
to false judgments or conclusions —

if this were otherwise au knowledge would be impos lect 
sible — the root of our nature would be a lie “ but 
in the application of the laws of our higher faculties 
to determinate cases many errors are possible and 
these errors may actually be occasioned by a variety 
of circumstances thus it is a law of our intelligence 
that no event no phenomenon can be thought as 
absolutely beginning to be we cannot but think that 
all its constituent elements had a virtual existence 
prior to their concurrence to necessitate its manifest 
ation to us we are thus unable to accord to it more 
than a relative commencement in other words we 
are constrained to look upon it as the effect of ante 
cedent causes now though the law itself of our in 
telligence — that a cause there is for every event — be 
altogether exempt from error yet in the application 
of this law to individual cases that is in the attribu 
tion of determinate causes to determinate effects we 
are easily liable to go wrong for we do not know 
except from experience and induction what particular 
antecedents are the causes of particular consequents 
and if our knowledge of this relation be imperfectly 
generalised or if we extend it by a false analogy to 
cases not included within our observation error is 
the inevitable consequence but in all this there is 
no fault no failure of intelligence there is only a de 
ficiency — a deficiency in the activity of intelligence 
while the will detemaines us to a decision before the 
understanding has become fully conscious of certainty 

the defeetive action of the understanding may arise dofoctiro 
from three causes in the first place the faculty of tho uuilor

tellect may bo without the necessary experience — 
may not possess the grounds on which a correct judg 
ment must be founded in the third place and this 
is the most frequent cause of error the failure of the 
understanding is from the incompetency of that act of 
will which is called attention attention is the vol 
untary direction of the mind upon an object with the 
intention of fully apprehending it the cognitive 
energy is thus as it were concentrated upon a single 
point we therefore say that the mind collects itself 
when it begins to be attentive on the contrary that 
it is distracted when its attention is not turned upon 
an object as it ought to be this fixing — this con 
centration of the mind upon an object can only be 
carried to a certain degree and continued for a certain 
time this degree and this continuance are both de 
pendent upon bodily circumstances and they are 
also frequently interrupted or suspended by the intru 
sion of certain collateral objects which are forced upon 
the mind either from without by a strong and sudden 
impression upon the senses or from within through 
the influence of association and these when once 
obtruded gradually or at once divert the attention 
from the original and principal object if we are not 
sufiiciently attentive or if the efibrt which accompanies 
the concentration of the mind upon a single object be 
irksome there arises hurrj and thoughtlessness in 
judging inasmuch as we judge either before we have

ought to proceed or have competently examined their

in my last lecture i concluded the survey of the 
errors which have their origin in the conditions and 
circumstances of the several cognitive faculties and 
now proceed to that source of false judgment which 
lies in the imperfection of the instrument of thought 
and communication — i mean language 

much controversy has arisen in regard to the ques 
tion — has man invented language but the differ 
ences of opinion have in a great measure arisen from 
the ambiguity or complexity of the terms in which 
the problem has been stated by language we may 
mean either the power which mau possesses of associ 
ating his thought with signs or the particular systems 
of signs with which different portions of mankind 
have actually so associated their thoughts 

taking language in the former sense it is a natural 
faculty an original tendency of mind and in this 
view man has no more invented language than he 
has invented thought in fact the power of thought

considered as elementary qualities of intelligence for 
while they are so different that they cannot be identi 
fied they are still so reciprocally necessary that the 
one cannot exist without the other it is true in 
deed that presentations and representations of given 
individual objects might have taken place although 
there were no signs with which they were mentally 
connected and by which they could be overtly ex 
pressed but all complex and factitious constructions 
out of these given individual objects in other words 
all notions concepts general ideas or thoughts proper 
would have been impossible without an association to 
certain signs by which their scattered elements might 
be combined in unity and their vague and evanescent 
existence obtain a kind of definite and fixed and

relative conditions of each other’s activity and both 
concur to the accomplishment of the same joint result 
the faculty of thinking — the faculty of forming 
general notions — being given this necessarily tends to 
energy but the energy of thinking depends upon the 
coactivity of the faculty of speech which itself tends 
equally to energy these faculties — these tendencies 
— these energies thus coexist and have always co 
existed and the result of their combined action is 
thought in language and language in thought so 
much for the origin of language considered in general 
as a faculty 

but though the faculty of speech be natural and 
necessary that its manifestations are to a certain ex 
tent contingent and artificial is evident from the 
simple fact that there are more than a single language 
actually spoken it may therefore be asked — was the 
first language actually spoken the invention of man

or an inspiration of the deity the latter hypothesis 
cuts but does not loose the knot it declares that 
ordinary causes and the laws of nature are insufficient 
to explain the phainomenon but it does not prove 
this insufficiency it thus violates the rule of parci 
mony by postulating a second and hypothetical cause 
to explain an effect which it is not shown cannot be 
accounted for without this violent assumption the 
first and greatest difficulty in the question is thus — 
it is necessary to think in order to invent a language 
and the invention of a language is necessary in order 
to think for we cannot think without notions and 
notions are only fixed by words® this can only be 
solved as i have said by the natural attraction be 
tween thought and speech — by their secret affinity 
which is such that they suggest and pari passu 
accompany each other and in regard to the ques 
tion — why if speech be a natural faculty it does not 
manifest itself like other natural principles in a uniform 
manner — it may be answered that the faculty of 
speech is controlled and modified in its exercise by 
external circumstances in consequence of which 
though its exertion be natural and necessary and 
therefore identical in all men the special forms of 
its exertion are in a great degree conventional and 
contingent and therefore different among different 
portions of mankind 

considered on one side languages are the results of 
our intelligence and its immutable laws in conse

allow us to compare and to recall them to certain pri jj — l 
mitive and essential forms — to evolve a system of 
universal grammar considered on another side each 
language is the offspring of particular wants of special 
circumstances physical and moral and of chance 

hence it is that every language has particular forms 
as it has peculiar words language thus bears the 
impress of human intelligence only in its general 
outlines there is therefore to be found reason and 
philosophy in all languages but we should be wrong 
in believing that reason and philosophy have in any 
language determined everything no tongue how per no un 
fect soever it may appear is a complete and perfect pc£t 
instrument of human thought from its very condi of thougiit 
tions every language must be imperfect the human 
memory can only compass a limited complement of 
words but the data of sense and still more the com 
binations of the understanding are wholly unlimited 
in number no language can therefore be adequate 
to the ends for which it exists all are imperfect but 
some are far less incompetent instruments than others 

from what has now been said you will be pre 
pared to find in language one of the principal sources 
of error but liefore i go on to consider the particular 
modes in which the imperfections of language are the 
causes of false judgments — i shall comprise the gen

indispensable instrument in the higher functions 
of thought and knowledge but as speech is a 
necessary but not a perfect instrument its 
imperfection must react upon the mind for the 
m altitude of languages the difficulty of their 
acquisition their necessary inadequacy and the 
consequent ambiguity of words both singly 
and in combination — these are all copious sources 
of illusion and error 


we have already sufficiently considered the reason 
why thought is dependent upon some system of signs 
or symbols both for its internal perfection and ex 
ternal expression the analyses and syntheses — the 
decompositions and compositions — in a word the ela 
borations performed by the understanding upon the 
objects presented by external perception and self 
consciousness and represented by imagination — 
these operations are faint and fugitive and would have 
no existence even for the conscious mind beyond the 
moment of present consciousness were we not able to 
connect to ratify and to fix them by giving to their 
parts which would otherwise immediately fall asun 
der a permanent unity by associating them with a 
sensible symbol which we may always recall at plea 
sure and which when recalled recalls along with it 
the characters which concur in constituting a notion 
or factitious object of intelligence so far signs are 
necessary for the internal operation of thought itself

but for the communication of thought from one mind 
to another signs are equally indispensable for in 
itself thought is known — thought is knowable only 
to the thinking mind itself and were we not enabled 
to connect certain complements of thought to certain 
sensible symbols and by their means to suggest in 
other minds those complements of thought of which we 
were conscious in ourselves we should never be able 
to communicate to others what engaged our interest 
and man would remain for man if an intelligence at 
all a mere isolated intelligence 

in regard to the question — what may these sen 
sible symbols be by which we are to compass such 
memorable effects — it is needless to show that mien 
and gesture which to a certain extent afford a kind 
of natural expression are altogether inadequate to the 
double purpose of thought and communication which 
it is here required to accomplish this double pur 
pose can be effected only by symbols which express 
through intonations of the voice what is passing in 
the mind these vocal intonations are either inarti 
culate or articulate the former are mere sounds or 
cries and as such an expression of the feelings of 
which the lower animals are also capable the latter 
constitute words and these as the expression of 
thoughts or notions constitute language proper or 
speech” speech as we have said as the instru 
ment of elaborating fixing and communicating our 
thoughts is a principal mean of knowledge and even 
the indispensable condition on which depends the ex 
ercise of our higher cognitive faculties but at the 
same time in consequence of this very dependence of 
thought upon language inasmuch as language is itself

not perfect the understanding is not only restrained 
in its operations and its higher development conse 
quently checked but many occasions are given of 
positive error for to say nothing of the impedi 
ment presented to the free communication of thought 
by the multitude of tongues into which human lan 
guage is divided in consequence of which all speech 
beyond their mothertongue is incomprehensible to 
those who do not make a study of other languages — 
even the accurate learning of a single langiiage is at 
tended with such diflbculties that perhaps there never 
yet has been found an individual who was thoroughly 
acquainted with all the words and modes of verbal 
combination in any single language — his mother 
tongue even not excepted but the circumstance of 
principal importance is that how copious and expres 
sive soever it may be no language is competent ade 
juately to denote all possible notions and all possible 
relations of notions and from this necessary poverty 
of language in all its different degrees a certain in 
evitable ambiguity arises both in the employment 
of single words and of words in mutual connection 

as this is the principal source of the error originat 
ing in language it will be proper to be a little more 
explicit and here it is expedient to take into ac 
count two circumstances which mutually affect each 
other the first is that as the vocabulary of every 
language is necessarily finite it is necessarily dispro 
portioned to the multiplicity not to say infinity of 
thought and the second that the complement of 
words in any given language has been always filled 
up with terms significant of objects and relations of 
the external world before the want was experienced

of words to express the objects and relations of the lect 

 xxxl 

internal 

from the first of these circumstances considered tti 
exclusively and by itself it is manifest that one of every lm 
two alternatives must take place either the words 
of a language must each designate only a single cm of uiii 
notion — a single fasciculus of thought — the multitude 
of notions not designated being allowed to perish 
never obtaining more than a momentary existence in 
the mind of the individual or the words of a language 
must each be employed to denote a plurabty of con 
cepts in the former case a small amount of thought 
would be expressed but that precisely and without 
ambiguity in the latter a large amount of thought 
would be expressed but that vaguely and equivocally 

of these alternatives each of which has thus its ad 
vantages and disadvantages — the latter is the one 
which has universally been preferred and accord 
ingly all languages by the same word express a mul 
titude of thoughts more or less differing from each 
other now what is the consequence of this it is 
plain that if a word has more than a single mean 
ing attached to it when it is employed it cannot of 
itself directly and peremptorily suggest any definite 
thought — all that it can do is vaguely and hypothe 
tically to suggest a variety of different notions and 
we are obliged from a consideration of the context — ¦ 
of the tenor — of the general analogy of the discourse 
to surmise with greater or less assurance with greater 
or less precision what particular bundle of characters 
it was intended to convey words in fact as lanwoniik 
guages are constituted do nothing more than sug “nuw 
gest — are nothing more than hints hints likewise

which leave the principal part of the process of inter 
pretation to be performed by the mind of the hearer 
in this respect the effect of words resembles the effect 
of an outline or shade of a countenance with which 
we are familiar in both cases the mind is stimu 
lated to fiu up what is only hinted or pointed at 
thus it is that the function of language is not so much 
to infuse knowledge from one intelligence to another 
as to bring two minds into the same train of thinking 
and to confine them to the same track in this pro 
cedure what is chiefly wonderful is the rapidity with 
which the mind compares the word with its correla 
tions and in general without the slightest effort de 
cides which among its various meanings is the one 
which it is here intended to convey but how mar 
vellous soever be the ease and velocity of this process 
of selection it cannot always be performed with equal 
certainty words are often employed with a plural 
ity of meanings several of which may quadrate or 
be supposed to quadrate with the general tenor of the 
discourse error is thus possible and it is also pro 
bable if we have any prepossession in favour of one 
interpretation rather than of another so copious a 
source of error is the ambiguity of language that a 
very large proportion of human controversy has been 
concerning the sense in which certain terms should 
be understood and many disputes have even been 
fiercely waged in consequence of the disputants being 
unaware that they agreed in opinion and only differed 
in the meaning they attached to the words in which 
that opinion was expressed on this subject i may 
refer you to the very amusing and very instructive 
treatise of werenfelsius entitled de logomachiis 
eruditorum

“ in regard to a remedy for this description of error lect 
— this lies exclusively in a thorough study of the 
language employed in the communication of knowy 
ledge and in an acquaintance with the rules of criti 
cism and interpretation the study of languages 
when rationally pursued is not so unimportant as 
many fondly conceive for misconceptions most fre 
quently arise solely from an ignorance of words and 
every language may in a certain sort be viewed as a 
commentary upon logic inasmuch as every language 
in like manner mirrors in itself the laws of thought 

“ in reference to the rules of criticism and interpre 
tation — these especially should be familiar to those 
who make a study of the writings of ancient authors 
as these writings have descended to us often in a very 
mutilated state and are composed in languages which 
are now dead how many theological errors for ex 
ample have only arisen because the divines were 
either ignorant of the principles of criticism and her 
meneutic or did not properly apply them i doctrines 
originating in a corrupted lection or in a figurative 
expression have thus arisen and been keenly defended 

such errors are best combated by philological weapons 
for these pull them up along with their roots 

“a thorough knowledge of languages in general 
accustoms the mind not to remain satisfied with the 
husk but to penetrate in even to the kernel with 
this knowledge we shall not so easily imagine that we 
understand a system when we only possess the lan 
guage in which it is expressed we shall not conceive 
that we truly reason when we only employ certain 
empty words and formulae we shall not betray our 
selves into unusual and obscure expressions under 
which our meaning may be easily mistaken finally

hardly necessary to say anything it is evident that 
some matters are obscure and abstruse while others

the former are solely derived from the presentations 
of sense external and internal whereas the latter 
though first manifested on the occasion of such pre

on the contrary they are laws principles forms no

cordingly out of the mind itself they must be deve

accidental acquisitions as the presen tative facul

that is only of facts and events — such empirical 
knowledge constitutes no necessary and universal 
judgment all in this case is contingent and particu

relative and precarious universality the cognitions 
on the other hand which are given as laws of mind 
are at once and in themselves universal and neces

— ence — this is either our own experience or the expe 

rience of others and in either case it is for us a mean 
of knowledge it is manifest that the knowledge we 

kinll acquire through our personal experience is far supe 
rior in degree to that which we obtain through the 
experience of other men inasmuch as our knowledge 
of an object in the former case is far clearer and more 
distinct far more complete and lively than in the 
latter while at the same time the latter also affords 
us a far inferior conviction of the correctness and cer 
tainty of the cognition than the former on the 
other hand foreign is far superior to our proper expe 
rience in this — that it is much more comprehensive 
and that without this man would be deprived of those 
branches of knowledge which are to him of the most 
indispensable importance now as the principal dis

and into the experience of others we must consider it 
more closely in this twofold relation® first then of

two kinds according as it is conversant about the 
objects of the one of these faculties or the objects of 
the other but the presentation of a fact of the ex

this paragraph you will remark affords only apii 
preliminary view of the general conditions of expe

the presentative or as they may with equal propriety 
be called the acquisitive faculties of perception 
external and internal no experience would be pos

make up experience there is moreover required 
of the phenomena or appearances the accumidation

primary matter of consideration it being always sup

above all a clear and distinct presentation or repre

“ when the distinctive peculiarities of the phae lect

nomena have been thus definitively recognised the 

second question emerges — what are the conditions 
of their reality these conditions are commonly 
called reqtiisites and under requisite we must un 
derstand all that must have preceded before the 
phuenomena could follow in order to discover the 
requisites we take a number of analogous cases or 
cases similar in kind and inquire what are the cir 
cumstances under which the phenomenon always 
arises if it does arise and what are the circumstances 
under which it never arises and then after a com 
petent observation of individual cases we construct 
the general judgment that the phenomenon never 
occurs unless this or that other phenomenon has pre 
ceded or at least accompanied it here however it 
must be noticed that nothing can be viewed as a requi s wht 
site which admits of any even the smallest exception ofhipw 
“ the requisite conditions being discovered the 
third question arises — what are the causes of the 
phenomena according to the current doctrine the 
causes of phenomena are not to be confounded with 
their requisites for although a phaeuomenon no more 
occurs without its requisite than without its cause 
still the requisite being given the phsenomenon does 
not necessarily follow and indeed very frequently 
does not ensue on the contrary if the cause occurs

how must the observation be instituted so as to lect 

afford us a satisfactory result in regard to all the four 

sides on which it behoves an object to be observed 
in the first place as preliminary to observation it is 
required that the observing mind bo tranquil and 
composed be exempt from prejudice partiality and 
prepossession and be actuated by no other interest 
than the discovery of truth tranquillity and com 
posure of mind are of pecubar importance in our ob 
servation of the phenomena of the internal world 
for these phienomona are not like those of the exter 
nal perceptible by sense enclosed in space continu 
ous and divisible and they follow each other in such 
numbers and with such a rapidity that they are at 
best observable with diflficulty often losing even their 
existence by the interference of the observing — the re 
flective energy itself but that the observation should 
be always conducted in the calm and collected state 
of mind required to purify this condition we must 
be carefid to obtain more and more a mastery over 
the attention so as to turn it with full force upon a 
single aspect of the phaenomena and consequently 
to abstract it altogether from every other its proper 
function is to contemplate the objects of observation 
tranquilly continuously and without anxiety for the 
result and this likewise without too intense an 
activity or too vigorous an application of its forces 

but the observation and concomitant energy of atten ° condi 
tion will be without result unless we previously well q™t°ovto 
consider what precise object or objects we are now to minj

does not effect anything nay it does not operate at 
all on this account such psychological questions as 
the following what takes place in the process of 
selfconsciousness — of perception — of vision — of 
hearing — of imagination c — cannot be answered 
as thus absolutely stated that is ivithout reference to 
some determinate object but if i propose the pro 
blem — what takes place when i see this or that 
object or better still when i see this table — the atten 
tion is stimulated and directed and even a child can 
give responses which if properly illustrated and ex 
plained will afford a solution to the problem if 
therefore the question upon the object of observation 
be too vague and general so that the attention is not 
suitably excited and applied — this question must be 
divided and subdivided into others more particular 
and this process must be continued until we reach a 
question which affords the requisite conditions we 
should therefore determine as closely as possible the 
object itself and the phases in which we wish to ob 
serve it separate from it all foreign or adventitious 
parts resolve every question into its constituent ele 
ments enunciate each of these as specially as possible 
and never couch it in vague and general expressions 
but here we must at the same time take care that the 
object be not so tom and mangled that the attention 
feels no longer any attraction to the several parts or 
that the several parts can no longer be viewed in their 
natural connection so much it is possible to say in 
general touching the manner in which observation 
ought to be carried on what may further be added 
under this head depends upon the particular nature 
of the objects to be observed”®

cedure it is impossible that it should not be given 
but for a comprehensive and allsided system of em 
pirical knowledge it is not sufficient to possess the 
whole data of observation to have collected these to 
gether and to have arranged them according to some 
external princijde it is likewise requisite that we 
have a thoroughgoing principle of explanation even 
though this explanation be impossible in the way of 
observation and a power of judging of the data ac 
cording to universal laws although these universal 
laws may not be discovered by experience alone 
these two ends are accomplished by different means 
the former we compass by the aid of hypothesis the 
latter by the aid of induction and analogy”® of 
these in detail in regard to hywthesis i give you 
the following paragraph 

h evil when a phenomenon is presented 
which can be explained by no principle afforded 
through experience we feel discontented and un 
easy and there arises an effort to discover some 
cause which may at least provisorily account 
for the outstanding phaenomenon and this cause 
is finally recognised as valid and true if through 
it the given phaenomenon is found to obtain a 
full and perfect explanation the judgment in 
which a phaenomenon is referred to such a pro 
blematic cause is called an hypothesis p 

hqotheses have thus no other end than to satisfy 
the desire of the mind to reduce the objects of its

knowledge to unity and system and they do this in lect 
recalling them ad interim to some principle through 
which the mind is enabled to comprehend them from 
this view of their nature it is manifest how far they 
are permissible and how far they are even useful and 
expedient throwing altogether out of account the 
possibility that what is at first assumed as hypothet 
ical may subsequently be proved true 

when our experience has revealed to us a certain 
correspondence among a number of objects we are 
determined by an original principle of our nature to 
suppose the existence of a more extensive correspond 
ence than our observation has already proved or may 
ever be able to establish this tendency to generalise 
our knowledge by the judgment — that where much 
has been found accordant all will be found accordant 

— is not properly a conclusion deduced from premises 
but an original principle of our nature which we may 
call that of logical or perhaps better that of philo 
sophical presumption this presumption is of two 
kinds it is either induction or analogy which though 
usually confounded are however to be carefully dis 
tinguished i shall commence the consideration of 
these by the following paragraph 

if cviii if we have imifonnly observed that pircviii 
a number of objects of the same class genus or 
species possess in common a certain attribute 
we are disposed to conclude that this attribute is 
possessed by all the objects of that class this 
conclusion is properly called an inference of 
induction again if we have observed that two 
or more things agree in several internal and

essential characters we are disposed to conclude 
that they agree likewise in au other essential 
characters that is that they are constituents of 
the same class genus or species this conclu 
sion is properly called an inference of analogy 
the principle by which in either case we are 
disposed to extend our inferences beyond the 
limits of our experience is a natural or ultimate 
principle of intelligence and may be called the 
principle of logical or more properly of philo 
sophical presumption’ 

“ the reasoning by induction and the reasoning by 
analogy have this in common that they both conclude 
from something observed to something not observed 
from something within to something beyond the sphere 
of actual experience they differ however in this 
that in induction that which is observed and from 
which the inference is drawn to that which is not ob 
served is a unity in plurality whereas in analogy 
it is a plurality in unity in other words in induc 
tion we look to the one in the many in analogy we 
look to the many in the one and while in both we 
conclude to the unity in totality we do this in induc 
tion from the recognised unity in plurality in analogy 
from the recognised plurality in unity thus as induc 
tion rests upon the principle that what belongs or does 
not belong to many things of the same kind belongs 

or does not belong to all things of the same kind 
so analogy rests upon the principle — that things which 
have many observed attributes in common have other

not observed attributes in common likewise”® it is lect 

hardly necessary to remark that we are now speaking 

of induction and analogy not as principles of pure 
logic and as necessitated by the fundamental laws 
of thought but of these as means of acquiring know 
ledge and as legitimated by the conditions of objective 
reality in pure logic analogy has no place and 
only that induction is admitted in which all the 
several parts are supposed to legitimate the inference 
to the whole applied induction on the contrary 
rests on the constancy — the uniformity of nature 
and on the instinctive expectation we have of this 
stability this constitutes what has been called the 
principle of logical prestimption though perhaps it 
might with greater propriety be called the principle 
of philosophical prestimption we shall now con 
sider these severally and first of induction 

an induction is the enumeration of the parts in indacti™

whole® now the parts may either be individuals or 
particulars strictly so called i say strictly so called 
for you are aware that the term particular is very 
commonly employed not only to denote the species as 
contained imder a genus but likewise to denote the 
individual as contained imder a species using how 
ever the two terms in their proper significations i 
say if the parts are individual or singular things the 
induction is then cdxiedi iiidividual whereas if the or two 
parts be species or subaltern genera the induction 
then obtains the name ol spedcd an example

it is manifest that special rests upon individual in 
duction and that in the last result all induction is 
individual for we can assert nothing concerning 
species unless what we assert of them has been pre 
viously observed in their constituent singularso 
for a legitimate induction there are requisite at 
least two conditions in the first place it is necessary 
that the partial and this word i use as including both 
the terms individual and patiicular — i say it is ne 
cessary that the partial judgments out of which the 
total or general judgment is inferred be all of the 
same quality for if one even of the partial judg 
ments had an opposite quality the whole induction 
would be subverted hence it is that we refute uni 
versal judgments founded on an imperfect induction 
by bringing what is called an instance instantia 
that is by adducing a thing belonging to the same 
class or notion in reference to which the opposite 
holds true for example the general assertion all 
dogs bark is refuted by the instance of the dogs of 
labrador or california i forget which — these do not 
bark in like manner the general assertion no qua 
druped is oviparous is refuted by the instance of the

ornithorhijnchus paradoxus but that the universal 

judgment must have the same quality as the partial 

is selfevident for this judgment is simply the asser 
tion of something to be true of all which is true of 
many 

the second condition required is that a competent second 
number of the partial objects from which the induc 
tion departs should have been observed for otherwise 
the comprehension of other objects under the total 
judgment would be rash“ what is the number of 
such objects which amounts to a competent induc 
tion it is not possible to say in general in some 
cases the observation of a very few particular or indi 
vidual examples is sufficient to warrant an assertion in 
regard to the whole class in others the total judgment 
is hardly competent until our observation has gone 
through each of its constituent parts this distinc 
tion is founded on the difference of essential and un 
essential characters if the character be essential to 
the several objeets a comparatively limited observa 
tion is necessary to legitimate our general conclusion 

for example it would require a far less induction to 
prove that au animals breathe than to prove that the 
mammalia and the mammalia alone have lateral 
lobes to the cerebellum for the one is seen to be a 
function necessary to animal life the other as far as 
our present knowledge reaches appears only as an 
arbitrary concomitant the difference of essential 
and accidental is however one itself founded on in 
duction and varies aecording to the greater or less 
perfection to which this has been carried in the pro 
gress of science the lateral lobes of the cerebellum 
may appear to future physiologists as necessary a

condition of the function of suckling their young as 
the organs of breathing appear to us of circulation 
and of life 

to sum up the doctrine of induction — “ this is 
more certain ° in proportion to the number and 
diversity of the objects observed — ° in proportion 
to the accuracy with which the observation and com 
parison have been conducted — ° in proportion as 
the agreement of the objects is clear and precise — 
and ° in proportion as it has been thoroughly ex 
plored whether there exist exceptions or not”“ 

almost all induction is however necessarily imper 
fect and logic can inculcate nothing more import 
ant on the investigators of nature than that sobriety 
of mind which regards all its past observations only 
as hypothetically true only as relatively complete 
and which consequently holds the mind open to 
every new observation which may correct and limit its 
former judgments 

so much for induction now for analogy ana 
logy in general means proportion or a similarity of 
relations thus to judge analogically or according to 
analogy is to judge things by the similarity of their 
relations thus when we judge that as two is to 
four so is eight to sixteen we judge that they are 
analogically identical that is though the sums in 
other respects are different they agree in this that 
as two is the half of four so eight is the half of 
sixteen 

in common language however this propriety of 
the terra is not preserved for hy analogy is not 
always meant merely hy proportion but frequently 
hy comparison — hy relation or simply hy similarity

in so far as analogy constitutes a particular kind of lect

reasoning from the individual or particidar to the 

universal it signifies an inference from the partial 
similarity of two or more things to their complete or 
total similarity for example — this disease coire 
sponds in many symptoms with those we have observed 
in typhus fevers it ivill therefore correspond in all 
thai is it is a typhus fever ° 

like induction analogy has two essential requi hh to 
sites in the first place it is necessary that of two condi 
or more things a certain number of attributes should 
have been observed in order to ground the inference 
that they also agree in those other attributes which 
it has not yet been ascertained that they possess it 
is evident that in proportion to the number of points 
observed in which the things compared together coin 
cide in the same proportion can it be with safety as 
sumed that there exists a common principle in these 
things on which depends the similarity in the points 
known as in the points unknown 

in the second place it is required that the predi nd 
cates already observed should neither be all negative 
nor all contingent but that some at least should be 
positive and necessary mere negative characters 
denote only what the thing is not and contingent 
characters need not be present in the thing at all in 
regard to negative attributes the inference that two 
things to which a number of qualities do not belong 
and which are consequently similar to each other only 
in a negative point of view — that these things are 
therefore absolutely and positively similar is highly 
improbable but that the judgment in reference to

the compared things say a and x must be of the 
same quality ie either both affirmative or both nega 
tive is selfevident for if it be said a is b x is 
not b a is not c x is c their harmony or simi 
larity is subverted and we should rather be war 
ranted in arguing their discord and dissimilarity iu 
other points and here it is to be noticed that ana 
logy differs from induction in this that it is not 
limited to one quality but that it admits of a mix 
ture of both 

in regard to contingent attributes it is equally 
manifest that the analogy cannot proceed exclusively 
upon them for if two things coincide in certain 
accidental attributes for example two men in respect 
of stature age and dress the supposition that there 
is a common principle and a general similarity 
founded thereon is very unlikely 

to conclude analogy is certain in proportion 
° to the number of congruent observations ° to 
the number of congruent characters observed ° to 
the importance of these characters and their essenti 
ality to the objects and ° to the certainty that the 
characters really belong to the objects and that a 
partial correspondence exists® like induction ana 
logy can only pretend at best to a high degree of 
probability it may have a high degree of certainty 
but it never reaches to necessity 

comparing these two jrocesses together — “ the 
analogical is distinguished from the inductive in this 
— that induction regards a single predicate in many 
subjects as the attribute z in a in b in c in d 
in e in f c and as these many belong to one 
class say q it is inferred that z will likewise be

o o o xxxii 

that is in all qs on the other hand analogy re l 

gards many attributes in one subject say m n o p 
in a and as these many are in part found in 
another subject say m and in b it is concluded 
that in that second thing there will also be found the 
other attributes say o and p through induction 
we therefore endeavour to prove that one character 
belongs or does not belong to all the things of a 
certain class because it belongs or does not belong to 
many things of that class through analogy on the 
other hand we seek to prove that all the characters 
of a thing belong or do not belong to another or 
several others because many of these characters be 
long to this other or these others in the one it is 
proclaimed — one in many therefore one in all — in 
the other it is proclaimed — many in one therefore all 
in one”’ 

“ by these processes of induction and analogy as induction 
observed we are unable to attain absolute certainty jiojtydonoi 
— a great probability is all that we can reach andiutoccr 
this for the simple reason that it is impossible”’ 
imder any condition to infer the unobserved from 
the observed — the whole from any proportion of the 
parts — in the way of any rational necessity even 
from the requisites of induction and analogy it is 
manifest that they bear the stamp of uncertainty 
inasmuch as they are unable to determine how many 
objects or how many characters must be observed in 
order to draw the conclusion that the case is the same 
with all the other objects or with all the other char 
acters it is possible only in one way to raise induc 
tion and analogy from mere probability to complete

certainty — viz to demonstrate that the principles 
which lie at the root of these processes and which 
we have already stated are either necessary laws of 
thought or necessary laws of nature to demonstrate 
that they are necessary laws of thought is impossible 
for logic not only does not allow inference from 
many to all but expressly rejects it again to de 
monstrate that they are necessary laws of nature is 
equally impossible this has indeed been attempted 
from the uniformity of nature but in vain for it is 
incompetent to evince the necessity of the inference of 
induction and analogy from the fact denominated 
the kiw of nature seeing that this law itself can only 
be discovered by the way of induction and analogy 
in this attempted demonstration there is thus the 
most glaring pclitio princiim the result which has 
been previously given remains therefore intact — 
induction and analogy guarantee no perfect cer 
tainty but only a high degree of probability while all 
probability rests at best upon induction and analogy 
and nothing else”“

quisite to consider — ° the subjective trust

the latter depends on the absolute and relative 
possibility of the fact itself testimony is either

lowest steps in the acquisition of science but to this 
mutual communication they are competent and each

the only question in reference to testimony is that lect 
which regards its credibility and the question con i 
ceming the credibility of the witness may be compre s ibjjt 
hended under that touching the credibility of testi 
mony the order i shall follow in the subsequent 
observations is this — i shall in the first place con 
aider the credibility of testimony in general and in 
the second consider the credibility of testimony in its 
particular forms of immediate and mediate 

first then in regard to the credibility of testi 
mony in general — when we inquire whether a cer 
tain testimony is or is not deserving of credit there 
are two things to be considered ° the object of 
the testimony that is the fact or facts for the truth 
of which the testimony vouches and ° the subject 
of the testimony that is the person or persons by 
whom the testimony is borne the question therefore 
concerning the credibility of testimony thus natu 
rally subdivides itself into two of these questions 
the first asks — what are the conditions of the 
credibility of a testimony by reference to what is 
testified that is in relation to the object of the testi 
mony the second asks — what are the conditions 
of the credibility of a testimony by reference to him 
who testifies that is in relation to the subject of the 
testimony “ of these in theii order 

on the first question — “ in regard to the matter i 
testified that is in regard to the object of the testi tmimo

— is possible absolutely or in itself when it can be con 
stnied to thought that is when it is not inconsistent 
with the logical laws of thinking a thing is relatively 
possible as an object of perception external or inter 
nal when it can affect sense or selfconsciousness 
and through such affection determine its apprehen 
sion by one or other of these faculties a testimony 
is therefore to be unconditionally rejected if the fact 
which it reports be either in itself impossible or im 
possible as an object of the presentative faculties 
impossibility of a thing as an object of these 
hyiical faculties must be decided cither upon physical or 
biiij upon metaphysical principles a thing is physically 
impossible as an object of sense when the existence 
itself or its perception by us is by the laws of the 
material world impossible it is metaphysically im 
possible when the object itself or its perception is pos 
sible neither through a natural nor through a super 
natural agency but to establish the physical impos 
sibility of a thing it is not sufficient that its existence 
cannot be explained by the ordinary laws of nature 
or even that its existence should appear repugnant 
with these laws it is requisite that an universal and 
immutable law of nature should have been demon 


strated to exist and that this law would be subverted 
if the fact in question were admitted to be physically 
possible in like manner to constitute the metaphy 
sical impossibility of a thing it is hy no means enough 
to show that it is not explicable on natural laws or even 
that any natural law stands opposed to it it is further 
requisite to prove that the intervention even of super 
natural agency is incompetent to its production that

“ to establish the credibility of a testimony in so riiiye 
far as this is regulated by the nature of its object rftn’dbrt 
there is besides the proof of the absolute possibility 
of this object required also a proof of its relative 
possibility that is there must not only be no contra 
diction between its necessary attributes — the attri 
butes by which it must be thought — but no contra 
diction between the attributes actually assigned to it 
by the testimony a testimony therefore which qua 
testimony is selfcontradictory can lay no claim to 
credibility for what is selfcontradictory is logically 
suicidal and here the only question is — does the 
testimony qua testimony contradict itself for if the 
repugnancy arise from an opinion of the vutness apart 
from which the testimony as such would still stand 
undisproved in that case the testimony is not at once 
to be repudiated as false for example it would be 
wrong to reject a testimony to the existence of a 
thing because the witness had to his evidence of its 
observed reality annexed some conjecture in regard to 
its origin or cause for the latter might well be 
shown to be absurd and yet the former would re 
main unshaken it is therefore always to be ob 
served — that it is only the selfcontradietion of a 
testimony qua testimony that is the selfcontradic 
tion of the fact itself which is peremptorily and irre 
vocably subversive of its credibility

of the

thii con 
nisti of two 
clemcnut — 
a honesty 
or veracity 


worthiness of a witness consists of two elements or 
conditions in the first place he must be willing in 
the second place he must be able to report the truth 
the first of these elements is the honesty — the sin 
cerity — the veracity the second is the competency 
of the witness both are equally necessary and if 
one or other be deficient the testimony becomes alto 
gether null these constituents likewise do not infer 
each other for it frequently happens that where the 
honesty is greatest the competency is least and where 
the competency is greatest the honesty is least but 
when the veracity of a witness is established there is 
established also a presumption of his competency for 
an honest man vdll not bear evidence to a point in re 
gard to which his recollection is not precise or to the 
observation of which he had not accorded the re 
quisite attention in truth when a fact depends 
on the testimony of a single witness the competency 
of that witness is solely guaranteed by his honesty 
in regard to the honesty of a witness — this though 
often admitting of the highest probability never ad 
mits of absolute certainty for though in many cases 
we may know enough of the general character of the 
witness to rely with perfect confidence on his veracity 
in no case can we look into the heart and observe 
the influence which motives have actually had upon 
his volitions we are however compelled in many 
of the most important concerns of our existence to 
depend on the testimony and consequently to confide 
in the sincerity of others but from the moral con 
stitution of human nature we are warranted in pre 
suming on the honesty of a witness and this pre 
sumption is enhanced in proportion as the following 
circumstances concur in its confirmation in the

firet place a witness is to be presumed veracious in lect 
this case in proportion as his love of truth is already 
established from others in the second place a wit™r 
ness is to be presumed veracious in proportion as he 
has fewer and weaker motives to falsify his testimony 

in the third place a witness is to be presumed vera 
cious in proportion to the likelihood of contradiction 
which his testimony would encounter if he deviated 
from the truth so much for the sincerity honesty 
or veracity of a witness 

“ in regard to the competency or ability of a wit u conyio 
ness — this in general depends on the supposition that 
he has had it in his power correctly to observe the 
fact to which he testifies and correctly to report it 

the presumption in favour of the competence of acircam 
witness rises in proportion as the following conditions ctthe 
are fulfilled — in the first place he must be presumed tim ofln 
competent in reference to the case in hand in proper ense 
tion as his general ability to observe and to commu 
nicate his observation has been established in other 


cases in the second place the competency of a wit 
ness must be presumed in proportion as in the par 
ticular case a lower and commoner amount of ability 
is requisite rightly to observe and rightly to report 
the observation in the third place the competency 
of a witness is to be presimed in proportion as it is 
not to be presumed that his observation was made or 
communicated at a time when he was unable correctly 
to make or correctly to communicate it so much 
for the competency of a witness 

“ now when both the good will and the ability the ereai

cause the fact which it goes to prove is one out of the 
ordinary course of experience” “ thus it would be 
false to assert with hume that miracles that is sus 
pensions of the ordinary laws of nature are incap 
able of proof because contradicted by what we have 
been able to observe “ on the contrary where the 
trustworthiness of a witness or witnesses is unim 
peachable the very circumstance that the object is 
one in itself unusual and marvellous adds greater 
weight to the testimony for this very circumstance 
would itself induce men of veracity and intelligence 
to accord a more attentive scrutiny to the fact and 
secure from them a more accurate report of their ob 
servation 

“ the result of what has now been stated in regard 
to the credibility of testimony in general is — that 
a testimony is entitled to credit when the requisite 
conditions both on the part of the object and on the 
part of the subject have been fulfilled on the part 
of the object these are fulfilled w’hen the object is 
absolutely possible as an object of the higher faculty 
of experience — the understanding — the elaborative 
faculty and relatively possible as an object of the 
lower or subsidiary faculties of experience — sense and 
selfconsciousness in this case the testimony qua 
testimony does not contradict itself on the part of 
the subject the requisite conditions are fulfilled when 
the trustworthiness that is the veracity and compe 
tency of the witness is beyond reasonable doubt in 
regard to the veracity of the witness — this cannot be 
reasonably doubted when there is no positive ground 
on which to discredit the sincerity of the witness and 
when the only ground of doubt lies in the mere gen

competency of a witness — this is exposed to no rea — — 

sonable objection when the ability of the witness to 
observe and to communicate the fact in testimony can 
not be disallowed having therefore concluded the 
consideration of testimony in general we proceed to 
treat of it in special that is in so far as it is viewed 
either as immediate or as mediate” “ of these in their 
order 

the special consideration of testimony when that ii tcti 
testimony is immediate — “an immediate testimony pmi 
or testimony at first hand is one in which the fact mi mcdi 
reported is an object of the proper or personal expe i imme 
rience of the reporter now it is manifest that an motv 
immediate witness is in general better entitled to cre 
dit than a witness at second hand and his testimony 
rises in probability in proportion as the requisites 
already specified both on the part of its object and on 
the part of its subject are fulfilled an immediate 
testimony is therefore entitled to credit — ° in pro 
portion to the greater ability with which the observ conaition 
ation has been made ° in proportion to the less baity 
impediment in the way of the observation being per 
fectly accomplished ° in proportion as what was 
observed could be fuuy and accurately remembered 
and ° in proportion as the facts observed and re 
membered have been communicated by intelligible 
and unambiguous signs 

“now whether all these conditions of a higher whether 
credibility be fulfilled in the case of any immediate condiu™ 
testimony — this cannot be directly and at once as itthe nz

probability 


consequently the validity of a testimony can only be 
accurately estimated from a critical knowledge of the 
personal character of the witness as given in his in 
tellectual and moral qualities and in the circum 
stances of his life which have concurred to modify 
and determine these the veracity of a mtness either 
is or is not exempt from doubt and in the latter case 
it may not only lie open to doubt but even be ex 
posed to suspicion if the sincerity of the witness be 
indubitable a direct testimony is always preferable to 
an indirect for a direct testimony being made with 
the sole intent of establishing the certainty of the fact 
in question the competency of the witness is less ex 
posed to objection if on the contrary the sincerity 
of the witness be not beyond a doubt and still more 
if it be actually suspected in that case an indirect 
testimony is of higher cogency than a direct for 
the indirect testimony being given with another view 
than merely to establish the fact in question the in 
tention of the witness to falsify the truth of the fact 
has not so strong a presumption in its favour if both 
the sincerity and the competency of the witness are 
altogether indubitable it is then of no importance 
whether the truth of the fact be vouched for by a 
single witness or by a plurality of witnesses on the 
other hand if the sincerity and competency of the 
witness be at au doubtful the credibility of a testi 
mony will be greater the greater the number of the 
witnesses by whom the fact is corroborated but here 
it is to be considered that when there are a plurality 
of testimonies to the same fact these testimonies are 
either consistent or inconsistent if the testimonies 
be consistent and the sincerity and competency of all 
the witnesses complete in that case the testimony

attains the highest degree of probability of which any 
testimony is capable again if the witnesses be in 
consistent — on this hypothesis two cases are pos 
sible for either their discrepancy is negative or it 
is positive a negative discrepancy arises where one 
witness passes over in silence what another witness 
positively avers a positive discrepancy arises where 
one witness explicitly affirms something which some 
thing another witness explicitly denies when the 
difference of testimonies is merely negative we may 
suppose various causes of the silence and therefore 
the positive averment of one witness to a fact is not 
disproved by the mere circumstance that the same 
fact is omitted by another but if it be made out 
that the witness who omits mention of the fact could 
not have been ignorant of that fact had it taken place 
and at the same time that he could not have passed 
it over without violating every probability of human 
action — in this case the silence of the one witness 
manifestly derogates from the credibility of the other 
witness and in certain circumstances may annihilate 
it altogether avhere again the difference is positive 
the discrepancy is of greater importance because 
though there are certainly exceptions to the rule 
an overt contradiction is in general and in itself of 
stronger cogency than a mere nonconfirmation by 
simple silence now the positive discrepancy of tes 
timonies either admits of conciliation or it does not 
in the former case the credibility of the several testi 
monies stands intact and the discrepancy among the 
witnesses is to be accounted for by such circumstances 
as explain without invalidating the testimony con 
sidered in itself in the latter case one testimony 
manifestly detracts from the credibility of another

for of incompatible testimonies while both cannot be 
true the one must be fake when reciprocally contra 
dictory or they may both be false when reciprocally 
contrary in this case the whole question resolves 
itself into one of the greater or less trustworthiness of 
the opposing witnesses is the trustworthiness of the 
counter witnesses equally great in that case neither 
of the conflictive testimonies is to be admitted again 
is the trustworthiness of the witnesses not upon a par’ 
in that case the testimony of the witness whose trust 
worthiness is the greater obtains the preference — and 
this more especially if the credibility of the other wit

so much for the credibility of testimony considered 
in special in so far as that testimony is immediate or 
at first hand and i now in the second place pass on 
to consider likewise in special the credibility of testi 
mony in so far as that testimony is mediate or at 
second hand 

“ a mediate testimony is one where the fact is an 
object not of personal but of foreign experience 
touching the credibility of a mediate testimony this 
supposes that the report of the immediate and that 
the report of the mediate witness are both trust 
worthy whether the report of the immediate witness 
be trustworthy — this we are either of ourselves able to 
determine viz from our personal acquaintance with 
his veracity and competence or we are unable of 
ourselves to do this in which case the credibility of 
the immediate must be taken upon the authority of 
the mediate witness here however it is necessary 
for us to be aware that the mediate witness is pos

mediate and of the immediate witness be sufficiently 
established it is of no consequence in regard to the 
credibility of a testimony whether it be at first hand 
or at second nay the testimony of a mediate may 
even tend to confirm the testimony of an immediate 
witness when his own competence fairly to appreciate 
the report of the immediate witness is indubitable 

if however the credibility of the immediate witness be 
unimpeachable but not so the credibility of the medi 
ate in that case the mediate testimony in respect of its 
authority is inferior to the immediate and this in the

witness is inferior to that of the witness at first hand

sages is drawn — ° from their acknowledgment by lect 
the author himself in other and these unsuspected — 

works ° from the attribution of them to the author

from the evidence of the most ancient mss on the 
other hand a passage is to be obelized as spurious —

of time and place and to the personal relations of the 
author ° when wanting in the more ancient codices

antes now as of various readings one only can be 
the tme while they may all very easily be false the 
problem which the criticism of integrity proposes to 
solve is — how is the genuine reading to be made out 

— and herein consists what is technically called the 
recension more properly the emendation of the text 

“ the emendation of an ancient author may be of emendtion 
two kinds the one of which may be called the his “ of two ’ 
twical the other the conjectural the former of these hitoricr 
founds upon historical data for its proof the latter jcctur”i 
again proceeds on grounds which lie beyond the sphere 
of historical fact and this for the very reason that his 
torical fact is found incompetent to the restoration of 
the text to its original integrity the historical emen 
dation necessarily precedes the conjectural because the 
object itself of emendation is wholly of an historical 
character and because it is not permitted to attempt 
any other than an emendation on historical grounds

lfct until from these very grounds themselves it be shown 
— that the restitution of the text to its original integrity 
uitorici cannot be historically accomplished historical emen 
dation is again of two kinds according as its judgment 
exteniai procceds on external or on internal grounds it founds 
“• upon external grounds when the reasons for the truth 
or falsehood of a reading are derived from testimony 
it founds upon internal grounds when the reasons for 
the truth or falsehood of a reading are derived from 
the writing itself historical emendation has thus a 
twofold function to perform and in its application to 
practice these must always be performed in conjunc 
tion viz it has carefully to seek out and accurately 
to weigh both the external and internal reasons in sup 
port of the reading in dispute of external grounds 
the principal consists in the confirmation afforded by 
mss by printed editions which have immediately 
emanated from mss by ancient translations and by 
passages quoted in ancient authors the internal 
grounds are all derived either from the form or from 
the contents of the work itself in reference to the 
form — a reading is probable in proportion as it cor 
responds to the general character of the language pre 
valent at the epoch when the work was written and 
to the peculiar character of the language by which the 
author himself was distinguished in reference to the 
contents — a reading is probable when it harmonises 
with the context that is when it concurs with the 
other words of the particular passage in which it 
stands in affording a meaning reasonable in itself and 
conformable with the author’s opinions reasonings 
and general character of thought”

it frequently happens however that notwithstand lect 

• xxxiv 

ing the uniformity of mss and other external sub 

sidia a reading cannot be recognised as genuine in 
this case it must be scientifically shown from the 
rules of criticism itself that this lection is cormpt 

if the demonstration thus attempted be satisfactory 
and if all external subsidia have been trietl in vain 
the critic is permitted to consider in what manner the 
corrupted passage can be restored to its integrity 

and here the conjectural or divinatory emendation 
comes into play a process in which the power and 
eflbciency of criticism and the genius of the critic are 
principally manifested” 

so much for c’riticism in its applications both to 
the authenticity and to the integrity of writings 

we have now to consider the general rules by which 
interpretation that is the scientific process of ex 
pounding the meaning of an author is regulated 

“ by the art of interpretation called likewise techni ii intr 
cally hermeneutic or exegetic is meant the comple 
ment of logical laws by which the sense of an ancient 
writing is to be evolved hermeneutic is either gen genemimid 
eral or special general when it contains those laws 
which apply to the interpretation of any writing 
whatever special when it comprises those laws by 
which writings of a particular kind are to be ex 
pounded the former of these alone is of logical 
concernment the problem proposed for the art of 
interpretation to solve is — how are we to proceed 
in order to discover from the words of a writing that 
sole meaning which the author intended them to 
convey in the interpretation of a work it is not

therefore enough to show in what signification its 
words may be understood for it is required that we 
show in what signification they must to the execu 
tion of this task two conditions are absolutely neces 
sary ° that the interpreter should be thoroughly 
acquainted with the language itself in general and 
with the language of the writer in particular and ° 
that the interpreter should be familiar with the sub 
jects of which the writing treats but these two 
requisites though indispensable are not of themselves 
suflicient it is also of importance that the expo 
sitor should have a competent acquaintance with the 
author’s personal circumstances and character of 
thought and with the history and spirit of the age 
and country in which he lived in regard to the inter 
pretation itself — it is to be again observed that as a 
writer could employ expressions only in a single sense 
so the result of the exposition ought to be not merely 
to show what meaning may possibly attach to the 
doubtful terms but what meaning necessarily must 
when therefore it appears that a passage is of doubt 
ful import the best preparative for a final determin 
ation of its meaning is in the first place to ascertain 
in how many different significations it may be con 
strued and then by a process of exclusion to arrive 
at the one veritable meaning when however the 
obscurity cannot be removed in that case it is the 
duty of the expositor before abandoning his task to 
evince that an interpretation of the passage is with 
out change absolutely or relatively impossible 

“ as to the sources from whence the interpretation 
is to be drawn — these are three in all — viz ° the 
tractus literarum the words themselves as they ap 
pear in mss ° the context that is the passage

are also called the noetic pure a liriori or 
transcendental elements of thought may be

distinguished from induction with which it is 
not unusually confounded 

“ the empirical knowledge of which we have 
hitherto been speaking does not however varied and 
extensive it may be suffice to satisfy the thinking 
mind as such for our empirical knowledge itself

obtain completion and which are of a very different

of the nature of the thinking principle itself philo 
sophers have indeed been found to deny the reality of 
such cognitions native to the mind and to confine 
the whole sphere of human knowledge to the limits of 
experience but in this case philosophers have over 
looked the important circumstance that the acts that 
is the apprehension and judgment of experience are

empirical cognitions originate exclusively in experi

come piecemeal and successively into existence and

to him who receives but to him who bestows lect 
information in both relations therefore it ought — 
to be considered and not as is usually done in 
the latter only” 

in illustrating this paragraph i shall commence expiic 
with the last sentence and before treating in detail 
of instruction and conference as means of extending 
the limits of our knowledge by new acquisitions de 
rived from the communication of others i shall en ni com 
deavour to show that the communication of thought of thought 
is itself an important mean towards the perfecting of tant mean 
knowledge in the mind of the communicator himself perfecting 
in this view the communication of knowledge is like loilgo in tho 
the attribute of mercy twice blessed — “ blessed to communica 
him that gives and to him that takes ” in teaching 
others we in fact teach ourselves 

this view of the reflex effect of the communication 
of thought on the mind whether under the form of 
instruction or of conference is one of high importance 
but it is one which has in modem times unfortimately 
been almost wholly overlooked to illustrate it in 
all its bearings would require a volume — at present 
i can only contribute a few hints towards its expo 
sition 

man is by an original tendency of his nature de mnnto 
termined to communicate to others what occupies his mfcd”t 
thoughts and by this communication he obtains attcst” 
clearer understanding of the subject of his cogitations 
than he could otherwise have compassed this fact riii rt

to more distinct accurate and orderly tliinking as 
this is the condition of distinct accurate and orderly 
communication of these the former requires the 
presence of others during the act of thought and is 
therefore only manifested in oral instruction or in 
conference whereas the latter is operative both in 
our oral aud in our written communications of these

do this is in fact only to accomplish the first step leot 
towards the perfecting of our cognitions or thoughts 

but the communication of thought in its higher ap influence of 
plications imposes on us far more than this and in liomd 
so doing it reacts with a still more beneficial influence inpcrfictinr 
on our habits of thinking suppose that we are not 
merely to express our thoughts as they spontaneously 
arise suppose that we are not merely extemporane 
ously to speak but deliberately to write and that 
what we are to communicate is not a simple and easy 
but a complex and difficult matter in this case no 
man will ever fully understand his subject who has 
not studied it with the view of communication while 
the power of communicating a subject is the only 
competent criterion of his fully understanding it

this tnith is also well enforced by the great vives 
“ doctrina est traditio corum quae quis novit ei qui 
non novit disciplina est illius traditionis acceptio 
nisi quod mens accipientis impletur dantis vero non 
exhauritur — imo communicatione augetur emditio

robert sanderson used to say “i learn much from 
my master more from ray equals and most of all 
from my disciples”® 

but i have occupied perhaps too much time on the 
influence of the communication of knowledge on those 
by whom it is made and shall now pass on to the 
consideration of its influence on those to whom it is 
addressed and in treating of communication in 
this respect i shall in the first place consider it 
as onesidetl and in the second as reciprocal or 
bilateral 

the unilateral communication of knowledge or 
instruction is of two kinds for it is either oral or 
written but as both these species of instruction pro 
pose the same end they are both to a certain extent 
subject to the same laws 

oral and written instruction have each their pecu 
liar advantages

has this advantage over that of books that as more 
natural it is more impressive hearing rouses the 
attention and keeps it alive far more efifectually than 
reading to this we have the testimony of the most 
competent observers “ hearing” says theophrastus” 
“ is of au the senses the most pathetic” that is it is 
the sense most intimately associated with sentiment 
and passion “ multo magis” says the younger

quffi pronuntiatio vultus habitus gestus etiam dicen

auditu quam ex studio et libro” 

and st jerome — “ habet nescio quid latentis ener 
gise viva vox et in aures discipuli de doctoris ore 
transfusa fortius sonat” 

a second reason why our attention and memory 
is always in the ratio of attention to things spoken 
is greater than to things read is that what is written 
we regard as a permanent possession to which we can 
always recur at pleasure whereas we are conscious 
that the “ winged words ” are lost to us for ever if we 
do not catch them as they fly as pliny hath it —

stmction is that man is a social animal he is thus 
naturally disposed to find pleasure in society and in 
the performance of the actions performed by those 
with whom he consorts but reading is a solitary 
hearing is a social act in reading we are not deter 
mined to attend by any fellowfeeling with others 
attending whereas in hearing our attention is not 
only engaged by oiur sympathy with the speaker but 
by our sympathy with the otlier attentive auditors 
around us 

such are the causes which concur in rendering 
oral instruction more effectual than written “ m 
varillas” says menage and varillas was one of the 
most learned of modern historians — and menage one 
of the most learned of modern scholars “ m varillas 
himself told me one day that of every ten things 
he knew he had learned nine of them in conversation 
i myself might say nearly the same thing” 

on the other hand reading though only a substi 
tute for oral instruction has likewise advantages 
peculiar to itself in the first place it is more easily 
accessible in the second it is more comprehensive 
in its sphere of operation in the third it is not

of education of principal importance and written

subsidiary a neglect of the oral instruction and an 
exclusive employment of the written — the way in 
which those who are selftaught the autodidacti 
obtain their education — for the most part betrays its 
onesided influence by a contracted cultivation of the 
intellect with a deficiency in the power of communi 
cating knowledge to others 

oral instruction necessarily supposes a speaker and 
a hearer and written instruetion a writer and a 
reader in these the capacity of the speaker and of 
the writer must equally fulfil certain common requi 
sites in the first place they should be fully masters 
of the subject with which their instruction is conver 
sant and in the second they should be able and 
willing to communicate to others the knowledge which 
they themselves possess but in reference to these 
several species of instruction there are various special 
rules that ought to be attended to by those who would 
reap the advantages they severally afford i shall 
commence with written instruction and comprise the 
niles by which it ought to be regulated in the follow 
ing paragraph 

if cxiii in regard to written instmction 
and its profitable employment as a means of in 
tellectual improvement there are certain rules 
which ought to be observed and which together 
constitute the proper method of beading these 
may be reduced to three classes as they regard 
° the quantity ° the quality of what is to be 
read or ° the fmode of reading what is to be read 

i as concerns the quantity of what is to be 
read there is a single rule — read much but 
not many works niultum non multa

ii as concerns the quality of what is to be 
read — there may be given five rules ° select 
the works of principal importance estimated ly 
relation to the several sciences themselves or to 
your particular aim in reading or to your iudi 
vidual disposition and wants ° read not the 
more detailed works upon a science until you 
have obtained a rudimentary knowledge of it in 
general ° make yourselves familiar with a 
science in its actual or prescut state before you 
proceed to study it in its chronological develop 
ment “ to avoid erroneous and exclusive 
views read and compare together the more im 
portant works of every sect and party ° to 
avoid a onesided development of mind combine 
with the study of works which cultivate the 
understanding the study of works which culti 
vate the taste 

iii as concerns the liode or manner of read 
ing itself there are four principal rules ° 
read that you may accurately remember but 
still more that you may fully understand ° 
strive to compass the general tenor of a work 
before you attempt to judge of it in detail s 
accommodate the intensity of the reading to the 
importance of the work some books are there 
fore to be only dipped into others are to be run 
over rapidly and others to be studied long and 
sedulously ° regulate on the same principle 
the extracts which you make from the works you

i in reference to the head of quantity the single 
rule is — read much ljut not many works though 
this golden rule has risen in importance since the 
world by the art of printing has been overwhelmed 
by the multitude of books it was still fully recog 
nised by the great thinkers of antiquity it is even 
hinted by solomon when he complains that “ of mak 
ing many books there is no end”® by quintilian by 
the younger pliny and by seneca the maxim “ mul 
tum legendum esse non multa” is laid down as the 
great rule of study “ all” says luther in his table 
talk “ who would study with advantage in any art 
whatsoever ought to betake themselves to the reading 
of some sure and certain books oftentimes over for 
to read many books produceth confusion rather than 
learning like as those who dwell everywhere are not 
anywhere at home” he alludes here to the saying of 
seneca “ nusquam est qui ubique est” “ and like as 
in society we use not daily the community of all our 
acquaintances but of some few selected friends even 
so likewise ought we to accustom ourselves to the best 
books and to make the same familiar unto us that is 
to have them as we use to say at our fingers’ ends” 
the great logician bisliop sanderson to whom i for 
merly referred as his friend and biographer isaac wal 
ton informs us said “ that he declined reading many 
books but what he did read were well chosen and 
read so often that he became very familiar with them 
they were principally three — aristotles rhetoric 
aquinas’s secimda sccundce and cicero particularly 
his offices” the great lord burleigh we are told

by his biographer carried cicero de officiis with 
aristotle’s rhetoric always in his bosom those being 
complete pieces “ that would make both a scholar and 
an honest man” “ our age” says herder “ is the 
reading age ” and he adds “ it would have been 
better in my opinion for the world and for science 
if instead of the multitude of books which now over 
lay us we possessed only a few works good and ster 
ling and which as few would therefore be more 
diligently and profoundly studied” “ i might quote 
to you many other testimonies to the same effect 
but testimonies are useless in support of so manifest 
a truth 

for what purpose — with what intent do we read 
we read not for the sake of reading but we read to 
the end that we may think reading is valuable 
only as it may supply to us the materials which 
the mind itself elaborates as it is not the largest 
quantity of any kind of food taken into the stomach 
that conduces to health but such a quantity of such 
a kind as can be best digested so it is not the 
greatest complement of any kind of information that 
improves the mind but such a quantity of such a 
kind as determines the intellect to most vigorous 
energy the only profitable reading is that in which 
we are compelled to think and think intensely 
whereas that reading which serves only to dissipate 
and divert our thought is either positively hurtful 
or useful only as an occasional relaxation from severe 
exertion but the amount of vigorous thinking is 
usually in the inverse ratio of multifarious reading 
multifarious reading is agreeable but as a habit it

is in its way as destructive to the mental as dram 
drinking is to the bodily health 

ii in reference to the quality of what is to be read 
the first of the five rules is — ‘ select the works of prin 
cipal importance in accommodation either to the seve 
ral sciences themselves to your particular aim in read 
ing or to your individual disposition and wants’ this 
rule is too manifestly true to require any illustration 
of its truth no one will deny that for the accom 
plishment of an end you ought to employ the means 
best calculated for its accomplishment this is all 
that the rule inculcates but while there is no difii 
culty about the expediency of obeying the rule there 
is often considerable diflbculty in obeying it to know 
what books ought to be read in order to learn a science 
is in fact frequently obtained only after the science has 
been already learned on this point no general advice 
can be given we have on all of the sciences works 
which profess to supply the advice which the student 
here requires but in general i must say they are of 
small assistance in pointing out what books we should 
select however useful they may be in showing us what 
books exist upon a science in this respect the british 
student also labours under peculiar disadvantages 
the libraries in this country are one and all of them 
wretchedly imperfect and there are few departments 
of science in which they are not destitute even of the 
works of primary necessity — works which from their 
high price but more frequently from the difficulty of 
procuring them are beyond the reach of ordinary 
readers 

under the head of quality the second rule is — 

‘ read not the more detailed works upon a science 
until you have obtained a rudimentary knowledge of

it in general’ the expediency of this rule is suffici 
ently apparent it is altogether impossible to read 
with advantage an extensive work on any branch of 
knowledge if we are not previously aware of its general 
bearing and of the relations in which its several parts 
stand to each other in this case the mind is over 
powereel and oppressed by the mass of details pre 
sented to it — details the significance and subordina 
tion of which it is as yet unable to recognise a con 
spectus — a survey of the science as a whole ought 
therefore to precede the study of it in its parts we 
should be aware of its distribution before we attend 
to what is distributed — we should possess the empty 
framework before we collect the materials with which 
it is to be filled hence the utility of an encyclo 
paedical knowledge of the sciences in general prelimi 
nary to a study of the several sciences in particular 
that is a summary knowledge of their objects their 
extent their connection with each other by this 
means the student is enabled to steer his way on the 
wide ocean of science by this means he always knows 
whereabouts he is and becomes aware of the point 
towards which his author is leading him 

in entering upon the study of such authors as plato 
aristotle descartes spinoza leibnitz locke kant 
c it is therefore proper that we first obtain a pre 
paratory acquaintance with the scojie both of their 
philosophy in general and of the particular work on 
which we are about to enter in the case of writers 
of such ability this is not difficult to do as there are 
abundance of subsidiary works affording the prelimi 
nary knowledge of which we are in quest but in the 
case of treatises where similar assistance is not at hand 
we may often in some degree prepare ourselves for a

third

regular perusal by examining the table of contents 
and taking a cursory inspection of its several depart 
ments in this respect and also in others the follow 
ing advice of gibbon to young students is highly de 
serving of attention “ after a rapid glance i trans 
late from the original french — after a rapid glance 
on the subject and distribution of a new book i sus 
pend the reading of it which i only resume after 
having myself examined the subject in all its relations 
— after having called up in my solitary walks all that 
 have read thought or learned in regard to the sub 
ject of the whole book or of some chapter in particu 
lar i thus place myself in a condition to estimate 
what the author may add to my general stock of know 
ledge and i am thus sometimes favourably disposed 
by the accordance sometimes armed by the opposition 
of our views” “ 

the third eule under the head of quality is — 

‘ make yourselves familiar with a science in its present 
state before you proceed to study it in its chronologi 
cal development’ the propriety of this procedure is 
likewise manifest unless we be acquainted with a 
science in its more advanced state it is impossible to 
distinguish between what is more or less important 
and consequently impossible to determine what is or 
is not worthy of attention in the doctrines of its earlier 
cultivators we shall thus also be overvhelmed by 
the infinitude of details successively presented to us 
all will be confusion and darkness where all ought to 
be order and light it is thus improper to study

the fourth rule under the same head is — ‘to foarth 
avoid erroneous and exclusive views read and com 
pare together the more important works of every party’ 

in proportion as different opinions may be entertained 
in regard to the objects of a science the more neces 
sary is it that we should weigh with care and imparti 
ality the reasons on which these different opinions rest 

such a science in particular is philosophy and such 
sciences in general are those which proceed out of 
philosophy in the philosophical sciences we ought 
therefore to be especially on our guard against that 
partiality which considers only the arguments in favour 
of particular opinions it is true that in the writings 
of one party we find adduced the reasons of the oppo 
site party but frequently so distorted so mutilated 
so enervated that their refutation occasions little 
effort ave must therefore study the arguments on 
both sides if we would avoid those onesided and con 
tracted views which are the result of partyspirit 

the precept of the apostle “ test all things hold fast 
by that which is good” is a precept which is applicable 
equally in philosophy as in theology but a precept 
that has not been more frequently neglected in the 
one study than in the other 

the fifth rule under the head of quality is — ‘ to fifth rui 
avoid a onesided development of mind combine with 
the study of works which cultivate the understanding 
the study of works which cultivate the taste’ the 
propriety of this rule requires no elucidation i there 
fore pass on to the third head — viz the manner of m mtn 
reading itself under which the first rule is — ‘ read fimti“

that you may accurately remember but still more 
that you may fully understand’ 

this also requires no comment reading should 
not be a learning by rote but an act of reflective think 
ing memory is only a subsidiary faculty — is valuable 
merely as supplying the materials on which the under 
standing is to operate we read therefore principally 
not to remember facts but to understand relations 
to commit therefore to memory what we read before 
we elaborate it into an intellectual possession is not 
only useless but detrimental for the habit of laying 
up in memory what has not been digested by the 
understanding is at once the cause and the effect of 
mental weakness 

the second rule under this head is — ‘strive to 
compass the general tenor of a work before you at 
tempt to judge of it in detail’ nothing can be more 
absurd than the attempt to judge a part before com 
prehending the whole but unfortunately nothing is 
more common especially among professional critics — 
reviewers this proceeding is however as frequently 
the effect of wilful misrepresentation as of uninten 
tional error 

the third rule under this head is — ‘ accommodate 
the intensity of the reading to the importance of the 
work some books are therefore to be only dipped 
into others are to be run over rapidly and others 
to be studied long and sedulously’ all books are not 
to be read with the same attention and accordingly 
an ancient distinction was taken of reading into lectio 
cursoria and lectio stutaria the former of these we 
have adopted in english cursory reading being a 
familiar and correct translation of lectio cursoria 
but lectio stutaria cannot be so well rendered by the

expression of stationary reading “ read not” says lect 
bacon in his fiftieth essay — “ read not to contradict 
and confute nor to believe and take for granted nor 
to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider 

some books are to be tasted others are to be swallowed 
and some few to be chewed and digested that is 
some books are to be read only in parts others to be 
read but not curiously and some few to be read 
wholly and with diligence and attention some iwoks 
also may be reatl by deputy and extracts made of 
them by others but that would be only in the less 
important arguments and the meaner sort of books 
else distilled books are like common distilled waters 
fleshy things” “ one kind of books” says the great 
historian johann von miiller® “ i read with great johnntoii 
rapidity for in these there is much dross to throw 
asidcf and little gold to be found some however there 
are all gold and diamonds and he who for example 
in tacitus can read more than twenty pages in four 
hours certainly does not understand him” 

rapidity in reading depends however greatly on 
our acquaintance with the subject of discussion at 
first upon a science we can only read with profit few 
books and laboriously by degrees however our 
knowledge of the matters treated expands the reason 
ings appear more manifest — we advance more easily 
until at length we are able without overlooking any 
thing of importance to read with a velocity which 
appears almost incredible for those who are only 
commencing the study 

the fourth rule under this head is — ‘ regulate on fourth 
the same principle the extracts which you make from 
the works you read’

thk character and comprehension of logic 

—a fragment 

sec above volume t page 

in the commencement of a course of academical instruction there 
are usually two primary questions which obtrude themselves 
and with the answer to these questions i projwse to occupy the 
present lecture 

the first of these questions is — what is the character and 
comprehension of the subject to be taught the second — what 
is the mode of teaching it in regard to the former of these the 
question — what is to be taught — in the present instance is as 
suredly not superfluous the subject of our course is indeed pro 
fessedly logic but as under that nibric it has been too often the 
practice in our scottish universities to comprehend almost every 
thing except the science which that name properly denotes it is 
evident that the mere intimation of a course of lectures on logic 
does not of itself definitely mark out what the professor is to 
teach and what the student may rely on learning 

i shall therefore proceed to give you a general notion of what 
logic is and of the relation in which it stands to the other 
sciences for logic — logic properly so called — is the allimport 
ant science in which it is at once my duty and my desire fully 
and faithfully to instruct you 

the very general — i may call it the very vague — conception 
which i can at present attempt to shadow out of the scope and na 
ture of logic is of course not intended to anticipate what is here 
after to be articulately stated in regard to the peculiar character 
of this science

appendix 


all science all knowledge is divided into two great branches 
for it is either ° conversant about objects known or ° con 
versant about the manner of knowing them in other words about 
the laws or conditions under which such objects are cognisable 
the former of these is direct science or science simply the 
latter reflex science — the science of science or the method of 
science 

now of these categories or great branches of knowledge simple 
science or science directly conversant about objects is again 
divided into two branches for it is either conversant about the 
phsenomena of the internal world as revealed to us in conscious 
ness or about the phsenomena of the external world as made 
known to us by sense the former of these constitutes the 
science of mind the latter the science of matter and each is 
again divided and subdivided into those numerous branches which 
together make up nearly the whole cycle of human knowledge 

the other category — the science of science or the method 
ology of science — falls likewise into two branches according as the 
conditions which it considers are the laws which determine the 
possibility of the mind or subject of science knowing or the 
laws which determine the possibility of the existence or ob 
ject of science being known science i repeat considered as 
reflected upon its own conditions is twofold for it either con 
siders the laws under which the human mind can know or the 
laws under which what is proposed by the human mind to know 
can be known of these two sciences of science the former — 
that which treats of those conditions of knowledge which lie in 
the nature of thought itself — is logic properly so called the 
latter — that which treats of those conditions of knowledge which 
lie in the nature not of thought itself but of that which we 
think about — this has as yet obtained no recognised appellation 
no name by which it is universally and familiarly known vari 
ous denominations have indeed lecn given to it in its several parts 
or in its special relations thus it has been called heuretic in so 
far as it expounds the rules of invention or discovery architec 
tonic in so far as it treats of the method of building up our ob 
servations into system but hitherto it has obtained as a whole 
no adequate and distinctive title the consequence or perhaps 
the cause of this want of a peculiar name to mark out the second

appendix 


 


science of science as distinguished from the first is that the two 
have frequently been mixed up together and that the name of 
logic has been stretched so as to comprehend the confused assem 
blage of their doctrines of these two sciences of the conditions 
of knowledge — the one owes its systematic development prin 
cipally to aristotle the other to bacon though neither of 
these philosophers has precisely marked or rigidly observed the 
limits which separate them from each other and from the cir 
cumstance that the latter gave to his great treatise the name of 
organum — the name which has in later times been applied to 
designate the complement of the logical treatises of the former 
— from this circumstance i say it has often been supposed that 
the aim of bacon was to build up a logic of his own upon the 
ruins of the aristotelic nothing however can be more errone 
ous either as to bacon’s views or as to the relation in which the 
two sciences mutually stand these are not only not inconsistent 
they are in fact as correlative each necessary to each dependent 
on the other and although they constitute two several doctrines 
which must be treated in the first instance each by and for itself 
they are however in the last resort only two phases — two mem 
bers of one great doctrine of method which considers in the 
counter relations of thought to the object and of the object to 
thought the universal conditions by which the possibility of hu 
man knowledge is regulated and defined 

but allowing the term logic to be extended so as to denote the 
genus of which these opposite doctrines of method are the species 
it will however be necessary to add a difference by which these 
special logics may be distinguished from each other and from the 
generic science of which they are the constituents the doctrine 
therefore which expounds the laws by which our scientific pro 
cedure should be governed in so far as these lie in the forms of 
thought or in the conditions of the mind itself which is the sub 
ject in which knowledge inheres — this science may be called for 
mal or subjective or abstract or pure logic the science again 
which expounds the laws by which our scientific procedure should 
be governed in so far as these lie in the contents materials or ob 
jects about which knowledge is conversant — this science may be 
called material or objective or concrete or applied logic 

now it is logic taken in its most unexclusive acceptation

which will constitute the object of our consideration in the follow 
ing course of the two branches into which it falls formal logic 
or logic proper demands the principal share of our attention and 
this for various reasons in the first place considered in reference 
to the quantity of their contents formal logic is a far more com 
prehensive and complex science than material for to speak first 
of the latter — if we abstract from the specialities of particular 
objects and sciences and consider only the rules which ought to 
govern our procedure in reference to the objectmatter of the sci 
ences in genera — and this is all that a universal logic can pro 
pose — these rules are few in number and their applications simple 
and evident a material or objective logic except in special 
subordination to the circumstances of particular sciences is there 
fore of very narrow limits and all that it can tell us is soon told 
of the former on the other hand the reverse is true for though 
the highest law’s of thought be few in number and though logic 
projer be only an articulate exposition of the universal necessity 
of these still the steps through which this exposition must be ac 
complished are both many and multifonn 

in the second place the doctrines of material logic are not 
only far fewer and simpler than those of formal logic they are 
also less independent for the principles of the latter once estab 
lished those of the other are either implicitly confirmed or the 
foundation laid on which they can be easily rested 

in the third place the study of formal logic is a more improv 
ing exercise for as exclusively conversant with the laws of thought 
it necessitates a turning back of the intellect upon itself which is 
a less easy and therefore a more invigorating energy than the 
mere contemplation of the objects directly presented to our observa 
tion 

in the fourth place the doctrines of formal logic are possessed 
of an intrinsic and necessary evidence they shine out by their 
native light and do not require any jiroof or corroboration beyond 
that which consciousncss itself sujjplics they do not therefore 
require as a preliminary condition any apparatus of acquired 
knowledge formal logic is therefore better fitted than material 
for the purposes of academical instniction for the latter primarily 
conversant with the conditions of the external world is in itself a 
less invigorating exercise as determining the mind to a feebler and

buffior cours des sciences seconds logique § p 

eugenius h aoyckrj p has the following — 

“ from what has been said therefore it clearly appears of what 
character are the diversities of logic and what its nature for 
one logic is natural another acquired and of the natural 
there is one sort according to faculty another according to dis 
position and of the acquired there is again a kind according to 
art and a kind according to science and the native logic 
according to faculty is the rational faculty itself with which every 
human individual is endowed through which all are qualified for 
the knowledge and discrimination of truth and which in propor 
tion as a man employs the less the less is he removed from irra 
tionality but the native logic according to disfhjsition is the 
same faculty by which some when they reason are wont to exert 
their cogitations with care and attention confusedly indeed and 
imcritically stiu however in pursuit of the truth the acquired 
according to art is the correct and corrected knowledge of the 
rules through which the intellectual energies are without fault 
or failure accomplished but the acquired according to science 
is the exact and perfect knowledge both of the energies themselves 
and also of the causes through which and through which exclu 
sively they are capable of being directed towards the truth” 


 native according to j 
logic 

 acquired acconling to 

“ and thus disposition adds to faculty consuetude and a 
promptness to energise art again adds to disposition a refine 
ment and accuracy of energy finally science adds to art the 
consciousness of cause and the power of rendering a reason in the

case of all the rules and the natural logician may bo able in his 
random reason to apprehend that so to speak one thing has de 
termined another although the nature of this determination may 
be beyond his ken but he whose disposition is exercised by re 
flection and imitation being able easily to connect thought with 
thought is cognisant of the several steps of the reasoning process 
howbeit this otherwise may be confused and disjointed but he 
who is disciplined in the art knows exactly that in an act of infer 
ence there arc required three terms and that these also should be 
thus or thus connected finally the scientific logician under 
stands the reason — why three terms enter into every syllogism — 
why there are neither more nor fewer — and why they behove to 
be combined in this and in no other fashion 

“ wherefore to us the inquiry appears ridiculous which is fre 
quently even to nausea clamorously agitated concerning logic — 
whether it should be regarded as an art or as a science

eonvihce tkoae echo lioce an inteluci and a vfili to attend — that a trivial slip in the ele 
mentary precepts of a logical theory becomes tlte cause of mightiest errors ii that theory 
iuelf — galen de temperamentis i c 


“ this new analytic is intended to complete and simplify the 
old — to place the keystone in the aristotelic arch of abstract 
logic the theory in particular of syllogism bating some improve 
ments and some errors of detail remains where it was left by the 
genius of the stagirite if it have not receded still less has it ad 
vanced it contains the truth but the truth partially and not 
always correctly developed — in complexity— even in confusion 
and why because aristotle by an oversight marvellous certainly 
in him was prematurely arrested in his analysis began his syn 
thesis before he had fully sifted the elements to be recomposed 
and thus the system which almost spontaneously would have 
evolved itself into unity and order he laboriously and yet imper 
fectly constructed by sheer intellectual force under a load of limi 
tations and corrections and rules which deforming the symmetry 


a an extract corresponding in part 
with that now given from the prospectus 
of “essaj towards a new analytic of 
logical forms” is republished in the dit 
cumtiemt on philosophy p to this 
extract the author has prefixed the fol 
lowing notice regarding the date of his 
doctrine of the quantification of the pre 
dicate — “ touching the principle of an 
explicitly quantified predicate i hid by

to extend and correct the logical doctrine 
upon this point in the article on logic

has seriously impeded the usefulness of the science this imper 
fection as i said it is the purpose of the new analytic to supply 

in the first place in the essay there will be shown that the 
syllogism proceeds not as has hitherto virtually at least been 
taught in one but in the two correlative and counter wholes 
metajhysical of comprehension and logical of extension 
the major premise in the one whole being the minor premise in 
in the other c — thus is relieved a radical defect and vital in 
consistency in the present logical system 

“ in the second place the selfevident truth — that we can only 
rationally deal with what we already understand determines the 
simple logical postulate — to state eiplicithj what is thought im 
pliciihj from the consistent apilication of this postulate on 
which logic ever insists but which logicians have never fairly 
obeyed it follows — that logically we ought to take uito account 
the quantity always understood ui thought but usually and for 
manifest reasons elided in its expression not only of the subject 
but also of the predicate of a judgment this being done and

subject or predicate are never on that account thought as indefi 
nite or indeterminate in quantity the only indefinite is parti

of an extensive maximum undivided or of an extensive minimum 
indivisible constitutes quantity universal general and quantity 
singular individual in fact definite and indefinite arc the only 
quantities of which we ought to hear in logic for it is only as 
indefinite that particular it is only as definite that individual and 
general quantities have any and the same logical avail

we now proceed to what has been usually treated under the 
relation of pixipositions and previously to the matter of infer 
ence altogether but which i think it would be more correct to 
consider as a species of inference or reasoning or argumenta 
tion than as merely a preparatory doctrine for in so far as these 
relations of propositions warrant us one being given to educe 
from it another — this is manifestly an inference or reasoning 
why it has not always been considered in this light is evident 
the inference is immediate that is the conclusion or second pro 
usition is necessitated directly and without a medium by the first 
tliere are only two propositions and two notions in this species of 
argumentation and the logicians have in general limited reason 
ing or inference to a mediate eduction of one proposition out of 
the correlation of two others and have thus always supposed the 
necessity of three terms or collated notions 

but they have not only been with few exceptions unsystematic 
in their procedure they have all of them if i am not myself 
mistaken been fundamentally erroneous in their relative doctrin e 

there are various immediate inferences of one proposition from

i shall consider ° those which have been considered by the logi

view of that which you will find in logical books

sition for to this we now limit our consideration the subject and 
predicate are transposeil that is the notion which was previously 
the subject becomes the predicate and the notion which was pre 
viously the predicate becomes the subject the proposition is said 
to be converted the proposition given and its product are to

which i shall not attempt to render into english the relation 
itself in which the two judgments stand is called conversion re 
ciprocation transposition and sometimes obversion conversio 
reciprocatio transpositio obversio 

the original or given proposition is called the converse or 
converted sometimes the prwjacent judgment judicium or 
propositio conversum conversa prajacens the other that into 
wliich the first is converted is called the converting and some 
times the subjacent j udgment propositio or jud convertens

such is the doctrine touching conversion taught even to tlie 
jreseut day this in my view is beset with errors but all these 
errors originate in two as these two are either the cause or the 
occasion of every other 

the first cardinal error is — that the quantities are not con 
verted with the quantified terms for the real terms compared in 
the convertend and which of course ought to reappear without 
change except of place in the converse are not the naked but the 
quantified terms this is evident from the following considerations 

i the terms of a proposition are only terms as they are terms 
of relation and the relation here is the relation of comparison 

’ as the propositional terms are teniis of comparison so they 
are only compared as quantities — quantities relative to each other 
an affirmative proposition is simply the declaration of an equation 
a negative proposition is simply the declaration of a nonequation 
of its terms to change therefore the quantity of either or of 
both subject and predicate is to change their correlation — the 
point of comparison and to exchange their quantities if different 
would be to invert the terminal interdependence that is to make 
the less the greater and the greater the less 

° the quantity of the proposition in conversion remains always 
the same that is the absolute quantity of the converse must be 
exactly equal to that of the convertend it was only from over 
looking the quantity of the predicate the second error to which we

shall immediately advert that two propositions exactly equal in 
quantity in fact the same proposition perhaps transposed were 
called the one universal the other particular by exclusive refer 
ence to the quantity of the subject 

° yet was it of no consequence in a logical point of view 
which of the notions collated were subject or predicate and their 
comparison with the consequent declaration of their mutual incon 
clusion or exclusion that is of affirmation or negation of no more 
real difference than the assertions — london is four hundred 
miles distant from edinburgh — edinburgh is four hundred 
miles distant from london in fact though logicians have 
been in use to place the subject first the predicate last in their 
examples of propositions this is by no means the case in ordinary 
language where indeed it is frequently even difficult to ascertain 
which is the determining and which the determined notion out 
of logical books the predicate is found almost as frequently before 
as after the subject and this in all languages you recollect the 
first words of the first olympiad of pindar apiarov ph vbop 
“best is water and the vulgate i forget how it is rendered in 
our english translation has “magna est veritas et prsevalebit” “ 
alluding to the bible let us turn up any concordance under any 
adjective title and we shall obtain abundant proof of the fact as 
the adjective great magnua has last occurred let us refer to 
cruden under that simple title here in glancing it over i find — 
“ great is the wrath of the lord — great is the lord and greatly to be 
praised — great is our god — great arc thy works — great is the holy 
one of israel — great shall be the peace of thy children — greiit is thy 
faithfulness — great is diana of the ephesians — great is my boldness 
— great is my glorying — great is the mystery of godliness” c 

the line of juvenal 

“noliilitas sola est atque imica irtus” 

is a good instance of the predicate being placed first 

the second cardinal error of the logicians is the not considering 
that the predicate has always a quantity in thought as much as 
the subject although this quantity be frequently not explicitly 
enounced as unnecessary in the common employment of language

for the determining notion or predicate being always thought as at 
least adequate to or cocxtensive with the subject or determined 
notion it is seldom necessar to express this and language tends 
ever to elide what may safely be omitted but this necessity 
recurs the moment that by conversion the predicate becomes the 
subject of the proposition and to omit its formal statement is to 
degrade logic from the science of the necessities of thought to an 
idle subsidiary of the ambiguities of speech an unbiassed con 
sideration of the subject will i am confident convince you that 
this view is correct 

° that the predicate is as extensive as the subject is easily 
shown take the proposition — all animal is man or all ani 
mals are men this we are conscious is absurd though we make 
the notion nmn or men as wide as possible for it does not mend 
the matter to say — all animal is all man or all animals are 
all men we feel it to be equally absurd as if we said — all man 
is all animal or all men are all animals here we are aware 
that the subject and predicate cannot be made coextensive if we 
would get rid of the absurdity we must bring the two notions into 
coextension by restricting the wider if we say — man is animal 
homo est animal we think though we do not overtly enounce 
it all man is animal and what do we mean here by animal 
we do not think — all but sorne animal and then we can 
make this indifferently either subject or predicate we can think 
— we can say some animal is man that is some or all man 
and e converso — man some or all is animal viz some animal 

it thus appears that there is a necessity in all cases for thinking 
the predicate at least as extensive as the subject whether it be 
absolutely that is out of relation more extensive is generally of 
no consequence and hence the common reticence of common 
language which never expresses more than can be understood — 
which always in fact for the sake of brevity strains at ellipsis 

° but in fact ordinary language quantifies the predicate so 
often as this determination becomes of the smallest import this 
it does either directly by adding all some or their equivalent pre 
designations to the predicate or it accomplishes the same end 
indirectly in an exceptive or limitative form 

ft directly — as peler john james c are all the apostles 
— mercmry venvs c are all the planets

i but this is more frequently accomplished indirectly by the 
equipollent forms of limihition or inclusion and exception 

for example by the limitative desijiiations alone or only we 
say — god alone is good wliich is equivalent to saying — god is all 
good that is god is all that is good virtue is the only nobi 
lity that is virtue is all noble that is all that is noblefi the 
symbols of the catholic and protestant divisions of christian 
ity may afford us a logical illustration of the point the ca 
tholics say — faith hope and charity alone justify that is the 
three heavenly virtues together are all justifying that is all that 
justifies omne justificans justum faciens the protestants 
say — faith alone justifies that is faith which they hold to 
comprise the other two virtues is all justifying that is all that

the rhetorical enouiicements of common speech we should not 
do as the logicians have been wont — introduce and deal with these 
in their grammatical integrity for tliis would be to swell out and 
deform our science with mere grammatical accidents and to such 
fortuitous accresccnces the formidable volume especially of the 
older logics is mainly owing in fact a laige proportion of the 
scholastic system is merely gramnmtical 

° the whole doctrine of the nonquantification of the predicate 
is only another example of the passive sequacity of the logicians 
they follow obediently in the footsteps of their great master we 
owe this doctrine and its prevalence to the precept and authority 
of aristotla he prohibits once and again the annexation of the 
imiversal predesignation to the predicate for why he says such 
predesignation would render the proposition absurd giving as his 
only example and proof of this the judgment — all man is all 
animal this however is only valid as a refutation of the ridicu 
lous doctrine held by no one that any predicate may be universally

quantified for to employ his own example what absurdity is 
there in saying that some animal is all man f yet this non 
sense be it spoken with all reverence of the stagirite has imposed 
the precept on the systems of logic down to the present day 
nevertheless it could be shown by a cloud of instances from the 
aristutelic writings themselves that this rule is invalid nay 
aristotles own doctrine of induction which is far more correct 
than that usually taught proceeils upon the silent abolition of the 
erroneous canon tlic doctrine of the logicians is therefore 
founded on a blunder which is only doubled by the usual aver 
ment that the predicate in what are technically called reciprocal 
propositions is taken universally vi materia and not vi fomuc 

but ° the nonquantification of the predicate in thought is 
given up by the logicians themselves but only in certain cases 
where they were forced to admit and to the amount which they 
could not possibly deny the predicate they confess is quanti 
fied by particularity in affirmative by universality in negative 
propositions but why the quantification formal quantification 
should be thus restricted in thought they furnish us with no valid 
reason 

to these two errors i might perhaps add as a third the confu 
sion and peqlexity arising from the attempt of aristotle and the 
logicians to deal with indefinite or as i wouhl call them indesig 
nate terms instead of treating them merely as verbal ellipses to 
be filled up in the expression before being logically considered 
and i might also add as a fourth the additional complexity and 
lcrplexity introduced into the science by viewing propositions 
likewise as affected by the four or six modalities but to these 
i shall not advert 

these are the two principal errors which have involved our 
systems of logic in confusion and prevented their evolution in 
simplicity harmony and completeness — which have condemned 
them to bits and fragments of the science and for these bits and 
fragments have made a load of rules and exceptions indispensable to 
avoid falling into frequent and manifest absurdity it was in 
reference to these two errors chiefly that i formerly gave you as a 
selfevident postulate of logic — “ explicitly to state what has been 
implicitly thought ” in other words that before dealing logically 
with a proposition we aie entitled to understand it that is to

ascertain and to enounce its meaning this quantification of the 
predicate of a judgment ls indeed only the beginning of the appli 
cation of the postulate but we shall find that at every step it 
enables us to cast away as useless a multitude of canons which 
at once disgust the student and if not the causes are at least the 
signs of imperfection in the science 

i venture then to assert that there is only one species of con 
version and that one thoroughgoing and selfsufficient i mean 
pure or simple conversion the other species — all are admitted 
to be neither thoroughgoing nor selfsuflficient — they are in fact 
only other logical processes accidentally combined with a transpo 
sition of the subject and pretlicate the conversio per accidens 
of boethius as an arapliative operation has no logical existence 
it is material and precarious and has righteously been allowed to 
drop out of science it is now merely an historical curiosity as 
a restrictive operation in which relation alone it stul stands in our 
systems it is either merely fortuitous or merely possible through 
a logical process quite distinct from conversion i mean that of 
restriction or subaltcrnation which will be soon explained con

of new elements and only holds through contradiction being just

unnatural ° precarious ° complex ° circuitous ° con 
fused ° inadequate breaking down in each and all of their 
species the greek logicians subsequent to aristotle have well 
and truly said ajtorpoj icmv icrortpojfij ti “omnisconversio 
estaequiversio” that is all conversion is a conversion of equal into 
eqiuil and had they attended to this principle they would have 
developed conversion in its true unity and simplicity they would 
have considered ° that the absolute quantity of the proposi 
tion be it convertend or converse remains always identical ’ 
that the several quantities of the collated notions remain always 
identical the whole change being the transposition of the quanti 
fied notion which was in the subject place into the place of pre 
dicate and vice versd 

aristotle and the logicians were therefore wtong ° in not 
considering the proposition simply as the complement that is as 
the equation or nonequation of two compared notions but on the 
contrary considering it as determined in its quantity by one of 
these notions more than by the other ° they were wrong in 
according too great an importance to tlie notions considered as pro 
positional tenns that is as subject and predicate independently 
of the import of these notions in themselves ° they were 
wrong in according too preponderant a weight to one of these 
terms over the other but differently iu difterent parts of the 
system for they were wrong in the doctrine of judgment in 
allowing the quantity of the proposition to be determined exclu 
sively by the quantity of the subject term whereas they were 
wrong its we shiu see in the doctrine of reasoning in considering 
a syllogism as exclusively relative to the quantity of the predicate 
extension so much for the theory of conversion before con 
cluding i have however to observe as a correction of the preva 
lent ambiguity and vacillation that the two propositions of the 
process together might be called the convertent or converting pro 
¦positiones convertentes and whilst of these the original proposi 
tion is named the convertend propositio convertenda its product 
would obtain the title of converse converted propositio conversaa 

the other species of immediate inference will not detain us 
long of these there are two noticed by the logicians

the first of these ijquipollence leqnipollentut or as i would 
term it double negation is deserving of bare mention it is of 
mere grammatical relevancy the negation of a negation is tanta 
mount to an affirmation b is not not a is manifestly only a 
roundabout way of saying b is a and vice versa we may express 
a position if we perversely choose by sublating a sublation the 
immediate inference of equipollence is thus merely the grammati 
cal translation of an affirmation into a double negation or of a 
double negation into an affirmation nonnullus and nonnemo 
for example are merely other grammatical expressions for aliquis 
or quidum so nonnihit nonnunquam nonnusquam c 

the latin tongue is almost peculiar among languages for such 
double negatives to express an affirmative of course the few 
which have found their place in logic instead of being despised 
or relegated to grammar have been fondly commented on by the 
ingenuity of the scholastic logicians in english some authors 
are fond of this indirect and idle way of speaking they prefer 
saying — “i entertain a not unfavourable opinion of such a one 
to saying directly i entertain of him a favourable opinion 
neglecting this i pass on to 

the third species of immediate inference noticed by the 
logicians this they call subaliernation but it may be more 
unambiguously styled restriction if i have £ at my credit 
in the bank it is evident that i may draw for £ or £ in like 
manner if i can say unexclusively that all men are animals i can 
say restrictively that negroes or any other fraction of mankind are 
animals this restriction is bilateral when we restrict both sub 
ject and predicate as — 

all triangle is all trilateral all ratiaiial is all risible 

 some triangle is some trilateral some rational is some risible 

it is unilateral by restricting the omnitude or universality either 
of the subject or of the predicate 

of the subject — 

all ntan is some animal 

 some man is some animal 

of the predicate as—

c 


a’enuix 


some animal m all risible 
some animal is some risible 

it has not been noticed by tlie logicians that there is only an 
inference by this process if the some in the inferred proposition 
means some at least that is some not exclusive of all for if we 
think by the some some only that is some not ail so far from 
there being any competent inference there is in fact a real opposi 
tion the logicians therefore to vimlicate their doctrine of the 
opposition of subalternation ought to have declared that the some 
was here in the sense of some only and to vindicate their doctrine 
of the inference of subalternation they ought in like manner to 
have declared that the some was here taken in the counter sense 
of some at least it could easily be shown that the eitors of the 
logicians in regard to opposition are not to be attributed to 
aristotle 

before leaving this process it may be proper to observc that we 
might well call its two jropositions together the restringent or 
restrictive propositiones restrinyentes vel restrictivw the given 
proposition might be called the restringend proposiiio restrin 
genda and the product the restrict or restricted propositio 
restricta 

so much for the species of immediate inference recognised by 
the logicians 

there is however a kind of immediate inference overlooked by 
logical writers i have fonnerly noticed that they enumerate 
among the sjecies of opposition subcontrariety subcontrarietas 
virevavtiorr to wit — some is some is not but that this is not 
in fact an opposition at all as in truth neither is subaltema 
tion in a certain sense subcoutrariety in like manner is with 
them not an opposition between two partial somes but between 
different and different in fact no opposition at all but if they 
are thus all wrong by commission they are doubly wrong by 
omission for they overlook tlie immediate inference which the 
relation of propositions in subcontrariety affortls this however 
is sufficiently manifest if i can sa all men are some animals 
or some animals are all men i am thereby entitled to say — 
all men are not some animals or some animals are not some 
men of course here the some in the inferred projwsitious means

some other as in the original proposition some mly but the 
inference is perfectly legitimate being merely a necessary explica 
tion of the thought for inasmuch as i think and say that all men 
are some animals i can think and say that they are some animals 
only which implies that they are a certain some and not any 
other animals® this inference is thus not only to some others 
indefinitely but to all others definitely it is further either afisrma 
tive from a negative antecedent or negative from an affirmative 
finally it is not bilateral as not of subject and predicate at 
once but it is unilateral either of the subject or of the predi 
cate this inference of subcontrariety i would call i nteyration 
because the mind here tends to determine all the parts of a whole 
whereof a part only has been given the two propositions toge 
ther might be called the integral or integrant propositiones 
integrates vel integrantes the given proposition would be styled 
the integrand propositio integrandd and the product the 
integrate propositio integrata 

i may refer you for various observations on the quantification 
of the predicate to the collection published under the title 
discussions on philosophy and literature 


the grand general or dominant result of the doctrine on which 
i have already partially touched but which i will now explain 
consecutively and more in detail is as follows — touching proposi 
tions — subject and predicate — touching syllogisms — in catego 
ricals major and minor terms major and minor premises figures 
first second third fourth and even what i call no figure are 
all made convertible with each other and all conversion reduced to a 
simple equation whilst in hypothcticals both the species viz 
conjunctive and disjunctive reasonings are shown to be forms

not of mediate argumentation at all but merely complex varieties 
of the immediate inference of restriction or subalternation and 
are relieved of a load of perversions limitations exceptions and 
rules the differences of quantity and quality c thus alone 
remain and by these exclusively are terms propositions and 
syllogisms formally distinguished quantity and quality combined 
constitute the only real discrimination of syllogistic mood syllo 
gistic figure vanishes with its perplexing apparatus of special 
rules and even the general laws of syllogism proper are reduced 
to a single compendious canon 

this doctrine is founded on the postulate of logic — to state 
in language what is efficient in thought in other words before 
proceeding to deal logically with any proposition or syllogism we 
must be allowed to determine and express what it means 

fiist then in regard to propositions — in a proposition the 
two terms the subject and predicate have each their quantity in 
thought this quantity is not always expressed in language for 
language tends always to abbreviation but it is always under 
stood for example in the proposition men are animals what 
do we mean we do not mean that some men to the exclusion 
of others are animals but we use the abbreviated expression 
men for the thought all men logic therefore in virtue of 
its postulate wfirrants nay requires us to state this explicitly 
let us therefore overtly quantify the subject and say all men 
are animals so far we have dealt with the proposition — 
we have quantified in language the subject as it was quantified 
in thought 

but the predicate still remains we have said — all men are 
animals but what do we mean by animals do we mean all 
animals or some animals i not the former for dogs horses 
oxen c are animals as well as men and dogs horses oxen c 
are not men men therefore are animals but exclusively of dogs 
horses oxen c all men therefore are not equivalent to au 
animals that is we cannot say as we cannot think that all men 
are all animals but we can say for ui thought wo do affirm 
that all men are some animals 

but if we can say as we do think that all men are some 
animals we can on the other hand likewnse say as we do think 
that some animals are all men

if this be true it is a matter of indifference in a logical point 
of view whatever it may be in a rhetorical which of the two 
terms be made the subject or predicate of the proposition and 
whichsoever term is made the subject in the first instance may 
in the second be converted into the predicate and whichsoever 
term is made the predicate in the first instance may in tlie 
second be converted into the subject 

from this it follows — 

° that a proposition is simply an equation an identification 
a bringing into congruence of two notions in respect to their 
extension i say in respect to their extension for it is this quan 
tity alone which admits of ampliation or restriction the compre 
hension of a notion remaining always the same being always taken 
at its amount 

° the total quantity of the proposition to be converted and 
the total quantity of the proposition the product of the conver 
sion is always one and the same in this uncxclusive point of 
view all conversion is merely simple conversion and the dis 
tinction of a conversion as it is called by accident ariscs only 
from the partial view of the logicians who have looked merely to 
the quantity of the subject they accordingly denominated a pro 
position universal ot particular as its subject merely was quanti 
fied by the predesignation some or all and where a proposition 
like all men are animals in thought some animals was con 
verted into the proposition some animals are men in thought 
all men they erroneously supposed that it lost quantity was re 
stricted and became a particular proposition 

it can hardly be said that the logicians contemplated the re 
conversion of such a proposition as the preceding for they did 
not or rarely give the name of conversio per accidens to the case 
in which the proposition on their theory was turned from a par 
ticular into a universal as when we reconvert the proposition 
some animals are men into the proposition all men are ani 
mals’ they likewise neglected such affirmative propositions as

had in thought both subject and predicate quantified to their 
whole extent as au triangular figure is trilateral that is if 
expressed as understood all triangular is all trilateral figure — 
all rational is risible that is if explicitly enounced all rational 
is all risible animal aristotle and subsequent logicians had 
indeed frequently to do with propositions in which the predicate 
was taken in its full extension in these the logicians — but be it 
obiserved not aristotle — attempted to remedy the imperfection of 
the aristotelic doctrine which did not allow the quantificiition of 
the predicate to be taken logically or fonnally into account in 
affirmative propositions by asserting that in the obnoxious cases 
the predicate was distributed that is fully quantified in virtue of 
the matter and not ui virtue of the form it materia non rations 
forma but this is altogether erroneous for in thought we 
generally do nay often must fully quantify the predicate in our 
logical conversion in fact of a projmsition like all men are 
animals — some animals we must formally retain in thought 
for we cannot formally abolish the universal quantification of 
the predicate we accordingly must formally allow the propo 
sition thus obtained — some animals are all men 

the error of the logicians is further shown by our most naked 
logical notation for it is quite as easy and quite as natural to 
quantify a b or c as predicate as to quantify a b or c as 
subject thus allh is some a some a is all b

error of the logicians in their doctrine of negative propositions 
in negative propositions they say the predicate is always distri 
buted — always taken in its full extension now this is altogether 
untenable for we always can and frequently do think the pre 
dicate of negative propositions as only partially excluded from the 
sphere of the subject for example we can think as our naked 
diagrams can show — all men are not some animals that is not 
irrational animals in point of fact so often as we think a sub 
ject as partially included within the sphere of a predicate eo ipso 
we think it as partially that is particularly excluded therefrom 
logicians are therefore altogether at fault in their doctrine that 
the predicate is always distributed ie always universal in negative 
propositions” 

but if the preceding theory be true — if it be true that sub 
ject and predicate are as quantified always simply convertible 
the proposition being in fact only an cnouncement of their equa 
tion it follows and this also is an adequate test that we may at 
will identify the two terms by making them both the subject or 
both the predicate of the same proposition and this we can do 
for we can not only say — as a is b so conversely b is a or as 
all men are some animals so conversely some animals are ail 
men but equally say — a and b are convertible or convertible 
are b and a all men and some animals are convertible that is

subject whilst the negative extends to

both subject and predicate in other 
words to the whole proposition 

this doctrine is altogether erroneous 
it is an erroneous theory devised to 
explain an erroneous practice in the 
first place we have here a commutation 
of negation with quantification and at 
the same time conversion direct con 
version at least will not be said to 
change the quality either of a negative 
or affirmative proposition in the se 
cond place it cannot be pretended that 
negation has an exclusive or even greater 
affinity to universal than to particu 
lar quantification we can equally well 
say not tome not all not any and the 
reason why one of these forms is pre 
ferred lies certainly not in any attrac

the general errors in regard to conversion — the errors from 
which all the rest proceed are — 

° the omission to quantify the predicate throughout 

° the conceit that the quantities did not belong to the terms 

° tlie conceit that the quantities were not to be transposed 
with their relative terms 

® the onesided view that the proposition was not equally 
composed of the two terms but was more dependent on the sub

° that all this mass of error and confusion was from their 
overlooking the necessity of one simple and direct mode of con 
version missing the one straight road 


we have shown tliat a judgment or proposition is only a 
comparison resulting in a congruence an equation or nonequa 
tion of two notions in the quantity of extension and that these 
compared notions may stand to each other as the one subject and 
the other predicate as both the subject or as both the predicate of 
the judgment if this be true the transposition of the terms of 
a proposition sinks in a very easy and a very simple process 
whilst the whole doctrine of logical conversion is superseded as 
operose and imperfect as useless and erroneous the systems new 
and old must stand or fall with their doctrines of the conversion 
of propositiona 

thus according to the doctrine of the logicians conversion 
applies only to the naked terms themselves — the subject and 
predicate of the prejacent interchange places but the quantity 
by which each was therein affected is excluded from the move 
ment remaining to affect its correlative in the subjacent proposi 
tion this is altogether erroneous in conversion we transpose 
the compared notions — the correlated terms if we do not ever 
sion not conversion is the result 


if as the logicians suppose in the convertens the subject 
and predicate took each other’s quantity the proposition would 
be not the same relation of the same notions it makes no 
difference that the converse only takes place when the subject 
chances to have an equal amount or a less than the predicate 
there must be at any rate a reasoning concealed indeed to 
warrant it in the fonner case — that the predicate is entitled to 
take all the quantity of the subject being itself of equivalent 
amount in the second a reasoning of subaltemation that it is 
entitled to take the quantity of the subject being less than its 
own all this is false subject and predicate have a right to 
their own and only to their own which they carry with them 
when they become each other

ii a remarkable uncertainty prevails in regard to the meaning 
of particularity and its signs — some a here some may mean 
some only — some not all here some though always in a certain 
degree indefinite is definite so far as it excludes omnitude — is used 
in opposition to cdl this i would call its semidefinite meaning 
on the other hand some may mean some at least — some perhaps 
all in this signification some is thoroughly indefinite as it does 
not exclude omnitude or totality this meaning i would call the 
indefinite 

now of these two meanings there is no doubt that aristotle used 
particularity only in the second or thoroughly indefinite meaning 
for ° he does not recognise the incom possibility of the super 
ordinate and subordinate he makes all and on na or particu 
lar negative to be contradictories that is one necessarily tnie the 
other necessarily false but this is not the case in the semidefinite 
meaning the same holds good in the universal negative and 
particular afifirmative 


the particularity — the some — is held to be a definite some when 
the other tenn is definite as in ii and in and vii on the 
other hand when both terms are indefinite or particular as in iv 
and the some of each is left wholly indefinite 


the quantification of definitude or nonpartiadarity may 
designate ambiguously or indifferently one or otlier of three con 
cepts ° it may designate explicit omnitude or totality which 
when expressed articulately may le denoted by thus — au 
triangles are all trilaterals ° it may designate a class con 
sidered as undivided though not positively thought as taken in its 
whole extent and this may be articulately denoted by thus 
— the triangle is the trilateral — the dog is the latrant — 
here note the use of the definite article in english greek french 
german® c ° it may designate not what is merely undivided

ing the reason of tliis perhaps is that this distinction only 
emeis in the consideration of opposition and immediate infer 
ence which were less elaborated in the former theories of logic 
and does not obtrude itself in the consideration of mediate infer 
ence which is there principally developed on the doctrine of the 
logicians there is no opposition of subaltemation and by aris 
totle no opposition of subaltemation is mentioned by other 
logicians it was erroneously introduced the opposition of sub 
contraries is likewise improper being precarious and not between 
the same things aristotle though he enumerates this opposition 
was quite aware of its impropriety and declares it to be merely 
verbal not real® 

by the introduction of the first meaning of some we obtain a 
veritable opposition in subaltemation and an inference in sub 
contrariety which i would call integration 

 opposition of peopositions 

propositions may be considered under two views according as 
their particularity or indefinitude is supposed to be thoroughly 
indefinite unexclusive even of the definite some meaning some 
at least some perhaps all some perhaps not any or definite 
indefinitude and so exclusive of the definite some meaning some 
at most — some only — some not all c the latter thus excludes 
omnitude or totality positive or negative the former does not 
the former is the view promulgated as alone contemplated by 
aristotle and has been inherited from him by the logicians with 
out thought of increase or of change the latter is the view which 
i would introduce and though it may not supersede ought i 
think to have been placed alongside of the other 

causes of the introduction of the aristotelic system alone — 

° to allow a harmony of logic with common language for 
language eliding all that is not of immediate interest and the 
determination of the subjectnotion being generally that alone 
intended the predicate is only considered in so far as it is thought 
to cover the subject that is to be at least coextensive with it

but if we should convert the terms the inadequacy would be 
brought to light 

° a great number of notions are used principally if not ex 
clusively as attributes and not as subjects men are consequently 
very commonly ignorant of the proportion of the extension be 
tween the subjects and predicates which they are in the habit of 
combining into propositions 

° in regard to negatives men naturally preferred to attribute 
positively a part of one notion to another than to deny a part 
hence the unfrequency of negatives witli a particular predicate 

on the doctrine of semidefinite particularity i would thus 
evolve the opposition or incompossibility of propositions neglect 
ing or throwing aside witli aristotle those of stibaltemation 
and subcontrariety but introducing that of inconsistency 

incompossibility is either of propositions of the same or of dif 
ferent quality incompossible propositions differing in quality are 
either contradictories without a mean— no third — that is if one be 
true the other must be false and if one be false the other must be 
true or contraries with a mean — a third — that is both may be 
false but both cannot be true incompossible propositions of the 
same quality are inconsistents and like contraries they have a 
mean that is both may be false but both cannot be trua 

contradictories are again either simple or complex the simple 
are either of universals as undivided wholes or ° of in 
dividuals as indivisible partsa 

the complex are of universals divided as — 

contraries again which are only of divided universals are ° 
bilateral as — or ° unilateral as — — — — 
or s” cross as — — 

inconsistents are either ° affirmatives or ° negatives af 
firmatives as — — — negatives as — — the pro 
ksitions — are sometimes inconsistents sometimes consistents 

all the other propositional forms whether of the same or of 
different qualities are compossible or unopposed 

the differences in conipossibility of the two schemes of indefin 
ite and definite particularity lies ° in the whole inconsistents 
° in two contraries for contradictories ° according to the 

a qeiiond terms used as individual ma u nol morktl so that there are

former all oilirraative and all negative propositions arc consistent 
whereas in the latter these are inconsistent — — — 
among the affirmatives and among the negatives — — 
as said before — is in both schemes sometimes compossible 
and sometimes incompwssible ° two incompossibles to wit 
 — — which on the aristotelic doctrine are contradictories 
are in mine contraries 

the propositional form is consistent with all the affinnatives 
 is not only consistent with all the negatives but is compossible 
with every other form in universals it is useful only to divide a 
class and is opposed only by the negation of divisibility 

by adopting exclusively the indefinite particularity logicians 
threw away some important immediate inferences those to wit ° 
from the affirmation of one sotne to the negation of another and 
vice versa and ° from the affirmation of one inconsistent to the 
negation of another ° thus on our system but not on theirs 
affirming oilman to be some animal we have a right to infer that 
no man is some other animal affirming that some animal is all 
man we have a right to infer that some other animal is not any 
man affirming some nun are some blacks negroes we arc en 
titled to say that same some men are not some other blacks 
hindoos and also that other some men are not the same some 
blacks and so backwards from negation to affirmation this 
inference i would call that of integration 

° affirming all men are some animals we are entitled to 
infer the denial of the propositions all men are all animals some 
men are all aninuils and so in the negative inconsistents

° the relation of totototal coinclusion coidentity absolute 
convertibility or reciprocation afa 

° the relation of totototal coexclusion nonidentity abso 
lute inconvertibility or nonreciprocation ana 

“ the relation of incomplete coinclusion which involves the 
counterrelation of incomplete coexclusion partial identity and 
nonidentity relative convertibility and nonconvertibility reci 
procation and nonreciprocation this is of various orders and 
degreea 

a where the whole of one term and the part of another are 
coinclusive or coidentical afl this i call the relation of 
totopartial coinclusion aa all men are some animals this 
necessarily involves the counterrelation of totopartial coexclu 
sion ani as any man is not some animal but the con 
verse of this affirmative and negative affords the relations of 

b partitotal coinclusion ifa and coexclusion ina as 
some animal is all man some animal is not any man 

c there is still a third double relation under this head when 
two terms partially include and partially exclude each other ifl 
ini as some women are some authors and some women are 
not some authors this relation i call that of partipartial 
coindusion and partipartial coexclusion 

of these three general relations the first is technically styled 
the best the second is the worst and the third is intermediate 

former logicians knew only of two worse relations — a particular 
worse than a universal affirmative and a negative worse than an 
affirmative as to a better and worse in negatives they knew

appendix 


nothing for as two negative premises were inadmissible they had 
no occasion to determine which of two negatives was the worse or 
better but in quantifying the predicate in connecting positive 
and negative moods and in generalising a one supreme canon of 
syllogism we are compelled to look further to consider the inverse 
procedures of affirmation and negation and to show eg in v a 
and vl b ix a and x b how the latter by reversing the former 
and turning the best quantity of affirmation into the worst of 
negation annuls all restriction and thus apparently varies the 
quantity of the conclusion it thus becomes necessaiy to show 
the whole order of best and worst quantification throughout the 
two qualities and how affirmation commences with the whole in 
inclusion and negation with the parts in exclusion

as the negation always reduces the best to the worst relation 
in the intermediate relations determining only a commutation from 
equal to equal whilst in both the symbols of quantity in their in 
verse signification remain externally the same it is evident that 
the quantification of the conclusion will rarely be apparently diffe 
rent in the negative from what it is in the corresponding positive 
mood there are indeed only four differences to be found in the 
negative from the positive conclusions and these all proceed on the 
same principle — viz in v a and vi b in ix a and x b here 
the particular quantification of the positive conclusions disappears 
in the negative moods but this is in obedience to the general 
canon of syllogism — “ that the worst relation subsisting between 
either extreme and the middle should subsist between the extremes 
themselves” for what was the best relation in the former becomes 
the worst in the latter and as affirmation comes in from the 
greatest whole whilst negation goes out from the least part so in 
point of fact the some of the one may become the not any of the

— objections to the doctrine of a quantified 
predicate considered 

 general 

material and formal— their distinction 

but it is requisite seeing that there are such misconceptions 
prevalent on the point to determine precisely what is the formal 
which lies within the jurisdiction of logic and which logic gua 
rantees and what the material which lies without the domain of 
logic and for which logic is not responsible this is fortunately 
casy

logic knows — takes cognisance of certain general relations 
and from these it infers certain others these and tliese alone it 
knows and guarantees and these are formal of all beyond these 
forms or general relations it takes no cognisance affords no assur 
ance and only hypothetically says — if the several notions aplied 
to these forms stand to each other in the relation of those forms 
then so and so is the result but whether these notions are rightly 
applied that is do or do not bear a certain reciprocal dependence 
of this logic as logic knows nothing let abc represent three 
notions a containing b and b containing c in that case logic 
assures us that c is a part of b and b a part of a that a contains 
c that c is a part of b and a now all is formal the letters 
being supposed to lc mere abstract symbols but if we apply to 
them — fill them up by — the three determinate notions — animal 
— man — negro we introduce a certain matter of which logic is 
not itself cognisant logic therefore merely says — if these notions 
hold to each other the relations represented by abc then the 
same results will follow but whether they do mutually hold these 
relations — that as material is extra logical logic is therefore 
bound to exhibit a scheme of the forms that is of the relations in 
their immediate and mediate results which are determined by the 
mere necessities of thinking — by the laws of thought as thought 
but it is bound to nought beyond this that as material is beyond 
its jurisdiction however manifest this has however been fre 
quently misunderstood and the material has been currently passed 
off in logic as the formal 

but further logic is bound to exhibit this scheme full and un 
exclusive to lop or limit this in conformity to any circumstance 
extrinsic to the bare conditions — the mere form of thought is a 
material and consequently an illegitimate curtailment to take 
for instance the aberrations of common language as a model 
would be at once absurd in itself and absurd as inconsistent even 
with its own practice and yet this double absurdity the logic 
now realised actually commits for while in principle it avows 
its allegiance to thought alone and in part it has overtly repudi 
ated the elisions of language in part it has accommodated itself 
to the usages of speech and this also to the extent from which even 
grammar has maintained its freedom grammar the science jmo 
per — the nomologj’ of language has not established ellipsis ns a

third law beside concord and government nor has it even allowed 
concord or government to be superseded by ellipsis and why 
because the law though not externally expressed in language was 
still internally operative in thought logic ou the contrary the 
science proper — the iiomology of thought has established an im 
perative ellipsis of its abstract forms in conformity to the precari 
ous ellipses of outward speech and this although it professes to 
look exclusively to the internal process and to explicate— to fill 
up what is implied but not stated in the short cuts of ordinary 
language logic has neglected — withheld — in fact openly sup 
pressed onehalf of its forms the quantification of the predicate 
universally in affirmatives particularly in negatives because 
these forms though always operative in thought were usually 
passed over as superfluous in the matter of expression 

thus has logic the science of the form been made hitherto the 
slave of the matter of thought both in what it has received and in 
what it has rejected and well has it been punished in its servi 
tude more than half its value has at once been lost confusion 
on the one hand imperfection on the other its lot disgust con 
tempt comparative neglect the consequence to reform logic 
we must therefore restore it to freedom — emancipate the form 
from the matter — we must ° admit nothuig material under 
the name of formal and ° reject nothing formal under the 
name of material when this is done logic stripped of its acci 
dental deformity walks forth in native beauty simple and com 
plete easy at once and useful 

it now remains to show that the quantities of the predicate de 
nounced by logicians arc true logical forms 

• ••••• 

the logicians have taken a distinction on which they have de 
fended the aristotelic prohibition of an overt quantification of the 
predicate the distinction to wit of the formal in opposition to 
the maierial — of what proceeds vi fomue in contrast to what 
proceeds id maleriw it will be requisite to determine explicitly 
the meaning and application of these expressions for every 
logical process is formal and if the logicians be correct in what 
they include under their category of material the whole system 
which i would propose in supplement and correction of theirs 
must be at once surrendered as untenable

in the first place the distinction is not established in terms at 
least by aristotle on the contrary although the propositional 
and syllogistic relations which he recognises in his logical precept 
be all formal ho as indeed all others not unfrequently emplo’s 
some which are only valid say the logicians vi materia and not 
ratione formce that is in spite of logic 

but here it is admitted tliat a distinction there truly us it is 
consequently only necessary in the second place to ascertain its 
import what then is meant by these several principles 

the answer is easy peremptory and nnambignous all that is 
formal is true as consciously necessitated by the laws of thought 
all that is material is true not as necessitated by the laws of 
thought but as legitimated by the conditions and probabilities dis 
coverable in the objects about which we chance to think the one 
is a priori the other a posteriori the one is necessary the other 
contingent the one is known or thought the other unknown or 
unthoughk 

for example if i think that the notion triangle contains the 
notion trilateral and again that the notion trilateral contains the 
notion triangle in other words if i think that each of these is 
inclusively and exclusively applicable to the other i formally say 
and if i speak as i think must say — all triangle is all trilateral 
on the other hand — if i only think that all triangles are trilateral 
but do not think all trilatcrals to be triangular and yet say — all 
triangle is all trilateral the proposition though materially true 
is formally false 

again if i think that this that and the other ironattracting 
stones are some magnets and yet thereon overtly infer — all 
magnets attract iron the inference is formally false even though 
materially not untrue whereas if i think that this that and the 
other ironattracting stones are all magnets and thence conclude — 
all magnets attract iron my conclusion is formally true even 
should it materially prove false 

to give the former example in an abstract notation if i note 
c r i may formally convert the proposition and state 

r uw c but if i note c — f i cannot formally 
convert it for the r mean either f or f iod if i do 
the product may or may not be true according as it is accidentally

this being the distinction of formal and material — that what 
is formally true is true by a subjective or logical law — that what 
is materially true is true on an objective or extralogical condition 
the logicians with aristotle at their head are exposed to a double 
accusation of the gravest character for they are charged — ° 
that they have excluded as material much that is purely formal 
° that they have included as formal much that is purely material 
of these in their order 

° i shall treat of this under the heads of affirmative and of 
negative propositions 

of the four aflsrmative relations of concepts as subject and 
predicate to wit — the totototal the totopartial the 
partitotal • the partipartial one half are arbitrarily 
excluded from logic these are however relations equally neces 
sary and equally obtrusive in thought with the others and as 
fonnal realities equally demand a logical statement and considera 
tion nay in this partial proceeding logicians are not even self 
consistent they allow for example the totopartial dependency 
of notions and they allow of their conversion yet though the 
terms when converted retain and must retain their original re 
lation that is their reciprocal quantities we find the logicians 
after aristotle declaring that the predicate in afllrmative proposi 
tions is to be regarded as particular howbeit in this instance 
where the totopartial is converted into the partitotal relation 
their rule is manifestly false when i enounce — all man is 
animal i moan — and the logicians do not gainsay me — all man 
is some animal i then convert this and am allowed to say —

soie animal is man but i am not allowed to say in words 
though i say — indeed must say in thought — some animal is 
all nan and why simply because there is an old traditionary 
rule in logic which prohibits us in all cases at least of affirmative 
propositions to quantify the predicate universally and to estab 
lish a reason for this exclusion the principle of materiality has 
been called in but if all is formal which is necessitated by thought 
and if all that is formal ought to find an expression in logic in 
that case the universal quantification of the notion when it stands 
as predicate may be ought indeed on demand to be enounced 
no less explicitly than when it stood as subject this quantifica 
tion is no more material on the one alternative than on the other 
it is formal in both 

in like manner the totototal relation is denounced but a 
similar exposition shows that notions thought as reciprocating or 
coequal are entitled as predicate to have a universal quantifica 
tion no less than as subject and this formally not materially® 

in regard to the four negative relations of terms — the toto 
total — the totopartial — the partitotal — the parti 
partial in like manner one half but these wholly different 
classes are capriciously abolished i say capriciously for 
the relations not recognised in logic are equally real in thought 
ns those which are exclusively admitted why for example may 
i say as i think — some animal is not any man and yet not 
say convcrtibly as i stul think — any man is not some animal 
for tliis no reason beyond the caprice of logicians and the elisions 
of common language can be assigned neither can it be shown 
as i may legitimately think — some animal is not some animal 
to take an extreme instance that i may not formally express the 
same in the technical language of reasoning 

in these cases to say nothing of others the logicians have 
therefore been guilty of extruding from their science much that 
is purely formal and this on the untenable plea that what is 
formal is material 


a it w hardly requisite to notice the 
blundering doctrine of eomo authors 
that the predicate is materially quantified 
even when prcdcsignatcl as universal

 spectal 

two objections have been taken to the universal quantification 
of the predicate it is said to be— ° false ° if not false 
useless 

l tlie first objection may be subdivided into two heads inasmuch 
as it may be attempted to establish it a on material b on 
formal grounds of these in their order — 

a this ground seems to be the only one taken by aristotle 
who on three perhaps on four different occasions denounces the 
universal quantification of the predicate and he but implicitly 
limits it to affirmative propositions as “ always untrue the 
only proof of this unexclusive denunciation is however one siecial 
example which he gives of the falsity emerging in the proposition 
— all man is all animal this must be at once confessed false 
but it is only so materially and contingently — argues therefore 
nothing for the formal and necessary illegitimacy of such a quanti 
fication as extralogical this proof is logically incompetent for 
it is only because we happen through an external knowledge to 
be aware of the relations of the concepts man and animal that 
the example is of any import but because the universal quanti 
fication of the predicate is in this instance materially false is such 
quantification therefore always formally illegal that this is not 
the case let us take other material examples is it then materially 
false and formally incompetent to think and say — all human is 
all rational — all rational is all risilde — all risible is all capa 
ble of admiration — all trilateral is all triangular — all trian 
gular is all figure with its angles equal to two right angles c 
or employing aristotle’s material example is it untrue as ho 
asserts to say — some animal is all man and this either collec 
tively — a part of the class animal is the whole of the class man 
— or dislributively — some several animal is every several man 

but the absurdity of such a reasoning is further shown by the 
feet that if it were cogent at all it would equally conclude against 
the validity of the universal quantification of the subject for 
this proposition is equally untrue employing always aristotle’s 
own material example — all animal is man 

after this it may the less surprise us to find that aristotle

appendix 


silently abandons his logical canon and adheres to truth and nature 

in fact he frequently does in practice virtually quantify the predi 
cate his common reasonings often proceeding on the reciprocation 
or coextension of subject and predicate nay in his logical 
system he expressly recognises this coextension unless indeed 
we overtly supply the quantification of the predicate his doctrines 
of induction and of demonstration proper have no logical nota 
tion and unless we covertly suppose it they are actually arrested 

his definitions of the universal as severally given in his pixor 
and posterior analytics are in this respect conflictive in the 
former his universal known in the schools as the universale 
prioristicuni explicitly forbids whereas the latter the univer 
sale posterioristicum of the schoolmen implicitly postulates the 
quantification of the predicate 

b the defect in the polemic of their master was felt by his 
followers they accordingly in addition to but with no correc 
tion of aristotle’s doctrine argue the question on broader ground 
and think that they disprove the formal validity of such quantifi 
cation by the follomng reasoning overlooking the case where 
the sulyect is particularly the predicate universally quantified as 
in the instance i have just given they allege the case of what are 
called reciprocating propositions where both subject and predicate 
are taken in their utmost extension vi materice as subsequent 
logicians “ say but not aristotle in this case then as in the 
example all man is all risible they assert that the overt quanti 
fication of the predicate is inept because the all as applied to 
the subject being distributively taken every individual man as 
socrates plato c would be all that is the whole class risible j 

this objection is only respectable by authority through the great 
the all but unexclusive number of its auegers in itself it is futile 

terms and their quantifications are used either in a distributive 
or in a collective sense it will not be asserted that any quantifi 
cation is per se neccssarily collective or necessarily distributive 
and it remains to ascertain by rule and relation in which signi 
fication it is or may be employed now a general rule or postu 
late of logic is — that in the same logical unity proposition or 
syllogism the same term or quantification should not be changed

in importa if therefore we insist as insist we ought that the 
quantification here all should be used in the same proposition 
in the same meaning that is as applied to the one term collec 
tively or distributively it should be so applied likewise to the 
other the objection fails thus taken collectively — all that 
is the whole class man is all that is the whole class risible 
the proposition is valid again taken distributively — all that 
is every several man is all that is evmi several risible the 
proposition is in like manner legitimate it is only by violating 
the postulate — that in the same logical unity the same sign or 
word should be used in the same sense that the objection applies 
whereas if the postulate be obeyed the objection is seen to be 
absurd 

it is hardly necessary to say anything in confutation of the 
general doctrine that in reciprocating propositions the predicate is 
taken in its full extent vi materice in the first place this doc 
trine was not promulgated by aristotle wlio frequently allowing — 
frequently using — such propositions implicitly abandons the rule 
which he explicitly lays down in regard to the nonpredesignation 
of the predicate by a universal in the second place apart from 
authority such doctrine is in itself unfounded for as form is 
merely the necessity of thought it is as easy to think two notions 
as totototally coinciding say triangle and trilateral as two 
notions totopartially and partitotally coinciding say triangle 
and figure accordingly we can equally abstractly represent their 
relations both by geometric quantities lines or figures and by 
purely logical symbols taking lines — the former i the 

latter i taking the symbols the former c r 

the latter a — b but if the reciprocation were deter 
mined by the mere matter by the object contingently thought 
about all abstract representation would be impossible so much 
for the first objection — that the universal quantification of the 
predicate would at least in affirmative propositions be falsa 

ii as to the second objection that such quantification would 
be useless and superfluous disorderly nay confusive this only 
manifests the limited and onesided view of the objectors even 
though aristotle be at their head

passage from his categories c y § 

“ further the primary substances trpwtai ovcriat — individual 
existences — because they are subjects to all the others and as all 
the others are predicated of or exist in them — are for this reason 
called substances by preeminence and as the primaiy sub 
stances sbind to all the others so stands the species to the genus 
for genera are predicated of species but not xmverselg species 
of genera so that of these two the species is more a substance 
than the genus” 

ammonius who has nothing in his commentary on the cate 
gories relative to the above passage of aristotle states however 
the common doctrine with its reasons in the following extract 
from his commentary on porphyry’s introduction f ed aid 
 

“ but confining ourselves to a logical consideration it behoves 
us to inquire — of these which are subjected to which predicated 
of the others and to be aware that genera are predicated of 
differences and species but not conversely tliese as we have 
said stand in a certain mutual order — the genus the difference 
and the species the genus first the species last the difierence in 
the middle and the superior must be predicated of the inferior 
for to predicate the inferior of the superior is not allowablu if 
for example we say — all man is animal the proposition is true 
but if we convert it and say — all animal is man the enounce 
ment is false® again if we say — all horse is irrational we are 
right but if conversely we say — all irrational is horse we are 
wrong for it is not allowed us to make a subject of the acci 
dental hence is it incompetent to say that animal is man as 
previously stated”

ii alexander aphrodisiensls 

alexander aphrodisiensls in his commentary on the first book 
of the prior a mdgtics and in reference to the second passage of 
aristotle states as follows 

and in the book of enouncement aristotle explains why he 
there says — ‘ that to predicate the universal of a universal predi 
cate is not true for there will be no projswition if in it we pre 
dicate the universal of the univeraal as all man is all animal 
he repeats the same also here showing how it is useless to 
attempt thus to express the consecution of higher from lower 
notions and adds that it is not only useless but impossible 
for it is impossible that all man should be all animal as 
useless to say apratop eitreu must have dropt out that all 
man is all risible we must not therefore apply the all to the 
consequent or predicate but to that from which it follows or 
subject for man is to be taken universally as that from which 
animal follows supposing this to be the consequent of all man 
thus shall we obtain a stock of universal propositions the process 
is the same in making man the consequent on its proper all 
but nan is not consequent on all biped but on all rational 

 the words ‘ as we express ourselves’ mean — as we express 
ourselves in common usage for we say that all man is simply 
animal and not all animal and that all pleasure is natural not 
all natural prefixing the all not to the consequent but to the 
subject from which the predicate follows” edd aid f a

subject constitutes one distinct class of propositions the same 
annexation to the predicate may not likewise constitute another 
and he answers that the supposition is absolutely groundless 
thus the enouncement — all or every man is all or every ani 
mal ttcis ivopoiitoi nav oov ecrri asserts that each man is 
all anunal — as horse ox c but this proposition is impos 
sible as is shown by aristotle in his here omitting the word 
‘ true’ for no affirmation can bo true in which the universal is 
predicated of a universal predicate that is in which the universal 
predesignatc is added to a universal predicate as when we say 
that man of whom all or as he says universally animal is 
predicated is not simply animal but all animal he therefore 
teaches that such an affirmation as utterly untrue is utterly in 
competent 

 neither does aristotle allow the pretlesignation some to be 
annexed to the predicate that propositions may thereby become 
true always or occasionally for logicians as they do not pro 
pose to themselves every superfluous variety of enunciation are 
prohibited from considering propositions not only those always 
true or always false but those which express no difference in re 
ference to necessary or impossible matter and afford us absolutely 
no discrimination of truth from falsehood thus particular pro 
positions which may be alternatively true and false ought not to 
have a predcsignated predicate for in a proposition which has 
all their power without any predesignation of its predicate why 
should we prefer to the simpler expression that which drags about 
with it a superfluous ailditamcnt why for example instead of — 
all man is some animal i read ti elov or all man is not all 
animal shoidd we not say — all man is animal and in place of 
all man is no stone not say — all man is not stone or what 
is a simpler and more natural enouncement still — no man is stone 

“and when we find some of the ancients teiiching that the 
particular affirmative predesignation is to be connected with the

entelechy hnfxudv tiva and plato rhetoric a certain some 
experience iijtetpiau two it is to be observed that tlic some 
is there added for the sake of showing that the predicate is not 
convertible with the subject but is its genus and requires the 
adding on of certain differences in order to render it the subject’s 
definition 

“ but add they is not the reasoning of aristotle refuted by 
fact itself seeing that we say all nmn is capable of all science 
thus truly connecting the universal predesignation with the uni 
versal predicate the answer is this — that in truth it is not the 
predicate to which we here annex the all for what is predi 
cated is what is said of the subject but what is here said of 
man is not that he is science but that he is capable of science 
if therefore the au were conjoined with the capable and the 
proposition then to remain true as when we say — all man is all 
capable of science in that case the reasoning of aristotle would 
be refuted but this proposition is necessarily false it in fact 
asserts nothing less than that of men each individual is all 
the kind — that socrates is not socrates only but also plato 
alcibiades and in short every other man for if all nan is all 
capable of science socrates being one of the all is therefore 
himself all capable of science so that socrates will be plato 
alcibiades c since they also are capable of science for if 
socrates be not at once plato alcibiades c neither will he be 
au capable of science 

“ now that we ought not to prefix the universal affirmative pre 
designation to the predicate whether the predicate be more gene 
ral than the subject as all man is all animal or whether they be 
coadeqnate as am man is all risible — this is manifest from 
what has been said even when the terms arc coadequate or re 
ciprocating the proposition runs into the absurd for declaring 
that au man is all risible it virtually declares that each indi 
vidual man is identical with all men that socrates in that he is 
a man is au risible consequently au man 

“ but why is it that the predicate is intolerant of the predesig 
nation au though this be akin to the countcrpredesignation no 
or none is it because the affirmative predicate if predicated 
universally tends always to contain imder it the subject and this 
not only when itself coadequate with the subject but when trans

cendingthe subject in extension while moreover through a parti 
cipation in its proper nature it is suited to bind up and reduce to 
unity the multitude of individuals of which the subject is the 
complement for as aristotle previously observed — ‘ the au 
does not indicate the universal but that the universal predicate 
inheres in or is attributed to the subject universally’ if there 
fore the aflinuative predicate thus tend to collect into one what 
are by nature distracted in virtue of having been itself previously 
recognised as simple in this case the all superadded to this 
universal predicate in fact enounces not a unity but a multitude 
of several things — things which it is manifestly unable to complicate 
into reciprocity but on the other hand since what is negatively 
predicated of is absolutely separated from the subject we are 
consequently enabled to deny of the subject au under the predicate 
as in saying au man is no stone we may indeed condense 
this proposition and say more simply all man is not stone or 
more simply stul no man is stone thus dispensing with the 
affirmative predesignation in a negative proposition”

“ what he says is to this purport — every simple proposition 
consists of two terms to these there is frequently added a de 
termination cither of universality or of particularity and to 
which of the two parts these determinations are to be added ho 
expounda it appears to aristotle that the determination ought 
not to be conjoined to the predicate term for in this proposition 
man is animal — homo est animal it is inquired whether the 
determination ought to be coupled with the detennination so that 
it shall be — omnis homo animal est — all or every man is ani 
mal or with the predicate so that it shall be — homo omne ani 
mal est — man is all or every animal or with both the one and 
the other so that it shall be all or every man is au or every 
animal omnis homo omne animal est but neither of these 
latter alternatives is competent for the determination is never 
joined ’to the predicate but exclusively to the subject seeing 
that all predication is either greater than the subject or equal

thus in this proposition — all or every man is animal omnts 
homo animal est animal the predicate is gieater than man 
the subject and again in the proposition — man is risible 
homo risibilis est risible the predicate is equated to tnan the 
subject but that the predicate should be less and narrower than 
the subject is impossible therefore in those predicates which are 
greater than the subject as for example where the predication is 
animal the proposition is manifestly false if the determination of 
universality be added to the predicate tenn for if we say man 
is animal homo est animal we contract animal which is greater 
than man by this determination to an identity of extension with 
man the subject although the predicate animal may be applied 
not only to man but to many other objects moreover in those 
subjects and predicates which are equal the same occurs for if i 
say all or every man is all or every risible omnis homo omne 
risihue est — in the first place in reference to the nature of man 
itself it is superfluous to adject the determination and again 
if this be added to all several men the proposition becomes false 
for when i say all or every man is all or every risible by this 
i seem to signify that the several men are each of them all or 
every risible which is absurd the determination is therefore to 
be placed not to the predicate but to the subject but the words 
of aristotle are thus redueed to the following import — in those 
predicates which are universal to add to them aught universal 
so that the universal predicate may be predicated universally 
is not true for tins is what he says — ‘‘ in the case of a univer 
sal predicate” that is in a proposition which has an universal pre 
dicate “ to predicate the universal itself universally is not true” 
for in an universal predicate that is which is rmiversal and is 
itself predicated in this case universally to predicate the predi 
cate which is universal that is to adject to it a determination of 
universality is not true for it cannot be that any affirmation 
should be true in which a universal determination is predicated of 
a predicate universally distributed and he illustrates the concep 
tion of the matter by the example all or every man is all or 
every animal omnis homo omne animal est of the incompe 
tency of which we have already spoken”

aristotle c vii § “ ‘ in what is predicated as an universal 
to predicate the universal universally is not true 

“ in this sentence he instructs us what is the place to which the 
determination of universality should be rightly added for he 
teaches that the universality which we call the universal determi 
nation is to be connected with the subject term never with the 
predicate for were we to say — au or every man is animal 
omnis homo animal esl we should say rightly atmexing the 
all or every to the subject that is to the term man but if we 
thus speak — all or every man is all or every animal omnis 
homo omne animal est we should speak falsely he therefore 
does not say this in the words — ‘ in what is predicated as an 
universal’ as animal of man for animal is imiversal being pre 
dicated of all or every man but he says — to predicate this 
universal itself animal to wit universally so that we enounce 
— all or every animal is man omne animal esse hominem is 
not true for he allows this to be rightly done ncitlier in these nor 
in any other affirmation he adds therefore — ‘ for no affirma 
tion will be true in which a universal predicate shall be univer 
sally predicated as all or every man is all or every animal 
omnis homo est omne animal’ 

“why this happens i will explain in a few words the 
predicate is always greater than the subject or equal to it 
greater as when i say man is animal homo animal est here 
animal is predicated man is subjected for animal is predicated of 
more objects than man again it is equal when we thus speak — 
man is risible homo risibilis est hero man is the subject 
risible the predicate but man and risible are equal for it is

vii— levi ben geisson 

levi ben gerson or levi gersonides a jewish philosopher 
who died in at perpignan wrote commentaries on avenoes’ 
commentary upon the logical books of aristotle the following is 
what he says on averroes’ doctrine touching the quantification of 
the predicate as it is found f of the venice edition in folio 
of of the works of aristotle and averroes — “ although 
it be not necessary that when the quantitative note is attached to 
the predicate this should bo false or superfluous seeing that it 
may be neither as when we say aw man is all rational and the 
same holds good in all other reciprocating propositions — never 
theless as in certain matters it may so happen aristotle has de 
clared that the quantitative note is not to be joined to the predi 
cate in any language but it may be here objected that if this 
be the case the quantitative note should not be annexed even to 
the subject since there too it may be either false or superfluous 
yuperfluous — as when we say soiiie animal is rational for the 
very same follows here as if we simply say animal is rational

the some therefore is superfluous false — as when we say all 

animal is rational the reason therefore assigned by aristotle 
why the quantitative note should not be annexed to the predicate 
is futile seeing that for the same reason it should not be connected 
with the subject to this we may answer that the cause why 
the quantitative note is not usually conjoined with the ircdicate 
is that there would thus be two quajsita at once — to wit whether 
the predicate were affirmed of the subject and moreover whether 
it were denied of everything beside for when we say all man 
is all rational we judge that all man is rational and judge like 
wise that rational is denied of all but man but these are in 
reality two different qumsita and therefore it has become usual 
to state them not in one but in two several propositions and 
this is selfevident seeing that a qusesitum in itself asks only — 
does or does not this inhere in that and not — does this inhere 
in that and at the same time inhere in nothing else ”

speaking of the text in the de interpretations the masters inter 
alia allege “ but if it be even elegantly said by a poet — ‘ nemo 
est omnis homo’ — ‘ non omnes omnibus artes’ — proverb ‘ unus 
homo nullus homo’ why may we not eontradict this aptly 
howbeit falsely — ‘ aliquis est omnis homo’ why they say do 
you determine the predicate by the note of universality seeing 
that the quantity of the proposition is not to be sought from the 
predicate but from the subject we answer because we wish 
to express a certain meaning in words which by no others can be 
done but if the mark of universality could only be employed in 
changing the quantity of propositions it would not be lawful to 
annex it to the part of the predicate we have therefore thought 
these few cautions requisite to evince that what is condemned by 
these critics for its folly is not incontinently sophistical or foolish 
babbling but as to the universal rule which aristotle enounces 
— ‘ no aflirmation will be true’ c — it is sufficient if it hold good 
in the majority of cases whether the predicate exceed the subject 
as au man is all animal — be its equal as all man is all risible

only however after “the most manifest demonstrations of the 
falsehood of this novel prejudice hal been once and again privately 
communicated to his very learned fnend ” titius that bidiger 
became at length tired as he expresses it “ of washing a brick” 
and laid the polemic before the public it was not certainly the 
cogency of this refutation which ought to have thrown the counter 
opinion into oblivion but this refutation such as it is though 
with nothing new is deserving of attention as presenting the most 
elaborate discussion of the question to be met with after am 
monius and in modem timea but the whole argument supposes 
certain foundations and it will be sufibcient to show that these 
are false to dispose of the whole edifice erected upon them i 
ought to mention that it was ridiger’s criticism which first directed 
my attention to the original of titius 

“ origo autem hujus erroris neglectus notissimie acquivoca 
tionls signomm omnia et quidam esse videtur qua hmc signa 
vel collective sumi possunt vel distributive priori modo quan 
titas in prmdicato concepts sensum quidem infert non penitus 
absurdnm emterum propositionem constituit identicam et frua 
traneam” ridiger then goes on to a more detailed statement 
of what he supposes to be the grounds on which the erroneous 
opinion proceeds® 

first case — “ verbi gratia quoddam animal eat omnia homo 
hoc est species queedam animalis homo nempe omne id quod 
homo eat quod alium sensum habere nullum potest quam quod 
omnia homo ait homo sic autem collective sumitur et signum 
subject et signum prcedicati’ this objection is absurd for it is 
suicidal applying equally to the proposition which the objector 
holds for good and to that which he assails as bad all man is 
some animal here is not animal or some animal just a 
certain species of animal and is not this species man to wit all 
that is man and nothing else there is consequently the same 
tautology in the one case as in the other and if we arc blamed 
for only virtually saying by the former all man is man does 
the objector say a whit more than this by the latter ridiger 
goes on “ quodsi vel altemm signum vel utramque distributive 
sumatur semper absurdus erit propositionis sensus”

appendix 


second case — vcrbi gratia sumatur utrumque signum distri 
butive sensus erit qiwddam individuuni animalis v g petrus 
est omne individuum homitiis y g davus oedipus’’ tliis is a 
still higher flight of absurdity for to refute the proposition it is 
first falsely translated into nonsense its true meaning both 
quantified terms being taken distributively is — au several men 
are some several animals or every several man is some several 
animal 

in these two cases therefore all is correct and the objection 
from the identity or absurdity of a quantified predicate null 

third case — “ sumatur signum subjecti distributive signum 
prsedicati collective sensus erit quoddain individuum animalis 
est universa species hominis” 

fourth case — “ sumatur denique signum subjecti collective 
signum pnedicati distributive sensus erit qucedam species ani 
malisut universale et pnedicabile est omne individuum hominis” 

in regard to these last two cases it is sufibcient to refer to what 
has been already said in answer to ammonius p or simply 
to recall the postulate that in the same logical unity proposition 
or syllogism the terms should be supposed in the same sense if 
this postulate be obeyed these two cases are inept and conse 
quently the objections superfluous 

kidiger then proceeds to treat us with four long “ demonstra 
tions a priori” and to one elaborate “ demonstration a posteriori 
but as these are all foimded on the blunders now exposed it would 
be idle to refute them in detail 

ridigcr it may well surprise us howbeit the professed cham 
pion of “ the old and correct doctrine” is virtually perhaps nneon 
ciously a confessor of the truth of “ the new and false prejudice 
for i find him propounding four several syllogistic forms three of 
which are only valid through the universal quantification of the 
predicate in affirmatives and two including the other one proceed 
on a correct though partial view opposed to that of the logicians

x — godfrey plodcqtjet 

godfrey ploucquet a philosopher of some account professor 
of logic and mctaphysic in the university of tubingen by various 
writings from the year endeavoured to atlvance the science 
of reasoning and his failure was perhaps owing more to the 
inadequacy and limitation of his doctrine than to its positive 
error to say nothing about his attempt to retluce logic to a 
species of computation in which his onesided views came into 
coiifliction with the onesided views of lambert he uiubjubtedly 
commenced auspiciously on the principle of a juantified predicate 
this like a few preceding logicians he certainly saw afforded a 
mean of simplifying the conversion of propositions but he did 
not see that it could accomplish much more if properly applied

in the theory of syllosm on the contrary in syllogistic he pro 
fessedly returns on mature consideration to the ordinary point 
of view and thinks himself successful in recalling the common 
doctrine of inference to a single canon that canon is this — 
“the terms in the conclusion are to be taken’ absolutely in the 
same extension which they hold in the antecedent” — in conclusi

extremes then afford the conclusion” — “ deleatur in praemissis

§ this rule is simple enough but unfortunately it is 
both inadequate and false inadequate and this was always 
sufficiently apparent for it does not enable ns to ascertain and 
these the principal questions how many terms — of what identity 
— of what quantity — and of what quality can be legitimately 
placed in the antecedent but it is not true though this was 
never signalised for its peculiar principle is falsified by eight of 
the thirtysix moods to wit in affirmatives by ix x xi xii and 
in negatives by ix b x a xl b xii a“ in all these the quan 
tity of an extreme in the conclusion is less than its quantity in the 
antecedent we can hardly therefore wonder that ploucqiiet’s 
logical speculations have been neglected or contemned although 
their author be an independent and learned thinker and his works 
all well worthy of jcrusal but though dismissed by hegel and 
other german logicians not for its falsity with supreme contempt 
ploucquet’s canon has however found its admirers in this country

a proverbial expression in france for the anthorship of an acute

two systems of logic a larger logica restituta and a 
smaller logica contmeta i both published in to i shall 
quote only from the former 

it is imjtossible to deny derodon ’s subtlety but his blunders 
unfortunately outweigh his originabty leaving conversion as he 
found it after repeating with approbation the old rules — that the 
predicate is not to be overtly quantified universally p but 
to be taken in affirmative propositions particularly as in negative 
propositions universally p we are surprised to find him 
controverting in detail the special rules of syllogism this polemic 
as might be expected is signally unsuccessful for it is frequently 
at variance with all principle and uniformly in contradiction of his 
own it is indeed only interesting as a manifestation that the old 
logical doctrine was obscurely felt by so original a thinker to be 
erroneous for the corrections attempted by derodon are them 
selves especially on the ground which he adopts only so many 
errors he unhappily starts with a blunder for he gives as rectus 
an example of syllogism in which the middle term is even of ne 
cessity undistributed and he goes on pp 
 either to stumble in the same fashion or to adduce rea 
sonings which can only be vindicated as inferential by supplying 
a universal quantity to the predicate in affirmative propositions 
or by reducing it to particularity in negatives both in the teeth 
of derodon’s own laws i have however recorded in my table of 
syllogisms some of his examples both the two forms which he has 
named and four others which he only enounces according by 
liberal construction what was requisite to give them sense and 
which without doubt the author would himself have recognised

“ first axiom — things which agree in the same third agree 
among themselves 

“ second axiom — things whereof the one agrees the other 
does not agree in one and the same third these things do not 
agree among themselves 

“ third axiom — things which agree in no third do not agree 
among themselves 

fourth axiom — things which disagree in no third do not 
disagree among themselves 

“ hence are deduced the general rules of syllogisms 

“ of these the three first regard the quality not alone of pro 
positions 

“rule — if one of the premises be negative the conclusion 
will be negative by ax 

“rule if both premises be affirmative the conclusion will he 
affirmative by ax 

 rule — if both premises be negative nothing follows because 
of things mutually agreeing and mutually disagreeing both may 
be different from a third thing by ax

species mutually oppyosed of which it may be predicated according 
to various parts of its extension these specific terms do not 
therefore truly agree in one third unless one at least of them 
agrees with the whole middle by ax 

‘‘ rule — no term ought to he taken more universally in the 
conclusion than in the premises because no consequence is valid 
from the particular to the universal because wo should in that 
case transcend the agreement or disagreement of the two terms 
in a third on which ex hypothesi we found 

“ in like manner there are two rules concerning the quantity 
of propositions 

rule — if one of the premises he particular the conclusion 
will also he particular 

“ for case i — if the conclusion be affirmative therefore both 
premises wiu be aflbrmative by rule but in a particular pro 
position there is no term distributed the middle is therefore to 
be distributed in one or other of the premises by rule it will 
therefore be the subject of a universal affirmative proposition 
but the other extreme is also taken particularly when it is the 
predicate of an affirmative proposition the conclusion will there 
fore be particular by rule 

“ case — let the conclusion be negative its predicate is 
therefore distributed hence in the premises the major and the 
middle tenns are to be distributed by rules and 

“ but when one of the premises is negative the other is affirma 
tive by rule if one premise be particular these two terms only 
can be distributed since one premise affirms whilst the other is 
particular the minor extreme the subject of the conclusion is 
not therefore distributed in the premises it cannot therefore by 
rule be distributed in the conclusion 

rule — from two particular premises nothing follows at 
least according to the accustomed mode of speaking where the pre 
dicate of a negative proposition is understood to be distributed

tion of all heavenly bodies has its whole significance for my 
knowledge in this that there arc given individual heavenly 
bodies as sun and earth to which i apply it to enounce these 
relations it is in the first place necessary that i have a general rule 
as major proposition obersatz in the second a minor propo 
sition untersatz wliich subordinates cases to the rule and 
finally a concluding proposition which determines the cases 
through the rule on the other hand we see that every con 
clusion is an analyticohypothetic judgment and this always 
flows from the dictum do omni et nullo inasmuch as the relation 
of subordination of particular under universal notions is the only 
relation of reason and consequent given in the form of thought 
itself now if the conclusion as syllogism combines a plurality 
of judgments in its premises in this case the principle of the in 
ference must lie in a connection of the thoughts — a connection 
which is determined by the matter of these judgments in the 
simplest case when taking into account only a single syllogism 
i thus would recognise in the premises the relation of subordina 
tion between two notions by reference to the same third notion 
and therethrough perceive in the conclusion the relation of these 
two notions to each other i know for example that all men 
are mortal and that cains is a man consequently through the 
relation of the notion of mortality and of my imagination of 
cains to the notion vuin the relation of cains to mortality is 
likewise determined — cains is mortal the first of these views 
is a mere postulate but in conformity to the second we are 
enabled immediately to evolve the general form of syllogisms and 
from this evolution does it then become manifest that all possible 
syllogisms satisfy the postulate we therefore in the first instance 
attach ourselves to the second view through this there is deter 
mined as follows — 

“ here the determination of one notion is carried over to an 
other superordinatc or subordinate to itself to every syllogism 
there belong three notions called its terms termini we say 
notions begriffe because they are in general such and when indi 
vidual representations or images appear as terms in that case 
there is no intercommutation possible a major term or supe 
rior notion oberhegriff p is given as the logical determination 
of a middle term or notion mittelbegriff m and through this

it ia positively or negatively stated as the determination of a minor 
term or notion unterbegriff s 

“ if then we regard the propositions in which these relations 
are enounced there is firstly in the conclusion schlusssatz 
the minor term or inferior notion subordinated to the major term 
or superior notion s is p further in one of the premises the 
middle must be connected with the major term or notion m is p 
this is called the major proposition obersatz in the other 
again the minor is connected with the major term or notion s is 
m this is called the minor proposition u nteisatz 

“ the form of every syllogism is therefore — 

mior proposition m it p 

min or proposition s it m 

conclusion s it p 

“ in the example given above man is the middle term mortality 
the major term and caius the minor term the syllogism is — 


major proposition 
minor proposition 

conclusion 


all men are mortal 
caiui is a man 


caius is rnortal 


“ the fundamental relation in all syllogisms is that of the 
middle term to the major and minor terms in other words that of 
the carrying over of a logical determination from one notion to 
another through certain given subordinations for howbeit the 
dictum de omni et nullo as a common principle of all syllogisms 
in thefonuula — liviaf holds good of the universal holds also good 
of the particulars subordinate thereto and stiu more in that 
other — the attribute of the attribute is also the attribute of the 
thing itself — is proximately only applicable to the categorical sub 
ordination of a representation or notion under a notion still 
however the law of mental connection is altogether the same in 
syllogisms determined by the subordination of consequence under 
a reason hypothetic syllogisms or of the complement of parts 
under a logical whole disjunctive syllogisms the displayed 
form is the form of every possible syllogism in fact it also coin

cide with the first requirement that in the syllogism a case 
should always be determined by a rule inasmuch as every syllo 
gism proposes a universal premise in order rigorously to infer its 
conclusion this will bo more definitely shown when we treat of 
syllogisms in detail only the declaration that the rule is always 
the major proposition is sometimes at variance with the declara 
tion that the major proposition contains the relation of the 
middle term to the major term we must however in the first 
place always follow the determination of the latter for every 
syllogism properly contains the three processes — the subor 
dination of a particular under a universal this is the function of 
the minor proposition and the relation between the minor and major 
terms postulate of a logical determination for one of these 
two this is the function of the major proposition and the relation 
of the middle to the major tenn the carrying over this deter 
mination to that other this is the function of the conclusion and 
the relation of the minor to the major term 

“ § the subonlination of a particular to a universal must 
therefore in eveiy syllogism be understood wholly in general 
here either a particular may be detennined through its superordi 
nated universal and such an inference from universal to particular 
we shall call a sylloyism in the first figure or there is a universal 
known through its subordinated particular and this inference from 
the particular to the universal is called a syllogism in the second 
third figure if for example the subordination is given me — 
all gold is metal i can either transfer an attribute of metal 
for instance fusibility to the gold or enounce an attribute of 
gold ductility for instance of some metal in the first case i 
draw a conclusion in the first figure from the universal to the 
particular — 

all inetat u fusible 

a ii ynhl is metal 

a ll gold is fusible 

“ in the other case i conclude in the second third figure from 
the particular to the general — 

all gold is ductile 

all gold is metal 

some metal is ductile”

a circle is all or every plane surface c

the attribute of an affirmative premise is always taken particularly 
it would therefore seem that the calculations on which this demon 
stration rests are erroneous whensoever the attribute is not a term 
more general than the subject for we have seen that in these cases 
the attribute can be taken universally but it is to be observed that 
when the two terms of a proposition are identical if the one or the 
other may be taken universally they cannot both be so taken at 
once and that if it be the attribute which is taken universally it 
ought to be substituted for the subject which then affords a parti 
cular attribute a triangle is a figure which has three sides and 
three angles we cannot say triangle is all figure which c

which is now propounded they become at once superfluous and 
even erroneous it is perhaps needless to observe that the follow 
ing rules have reference only to the whole of extension 

the double rule of the first figure that is the figure in which 
the middle term is subject m the sumption and predicate in the 
subsumption is — sit minor ajjirmans nec major particularis 
here in the first place it is prescribed that the minor premise 
must be affirmative the reason is manifest because if the minor 
premise were negative the major premise behoved to be affirma 
tive but in this figure the predicate of the conclusion is the 
predicate of the major premise but if affirmative the predicate of 
that premise on the doctrine of the logicians is presumed par 
ticular and as the conclnsion following the minor premise is 
necessarily negative a negative proposition thus contrary to logi 
cal law has a particular predicate but if we allow a negative 
proposition to have in language as it may have in thought a 
particular or indefinite predicate the rule is superseded

the second rule or second part of the rule of this first figure 
is that the major premise should be universal the reason of 
this is equally apparent for we have seen that by the previous 
rule the minor premise eould not be negative in which case 
certainly had it been allowable the middle term would as predi 
cate have been distributed but whilst it behoved that the middle 
term should be once at least distributed or taken universally 
and as being the subject of the major premise it could only be 
distributed in a universal proposition the rule on the hypothesis 
of the logicians was compulsory but as we have seen that the 
former rule is on our broader ground inept and that the middle 
term may be universally quantified as the predicate either of an 
affirmative or negative subsumption it is equally manifest that tliis 
rule is in like manner redundant and even false 

in the second figure that is the figure in which the middle 
term is predicate both in sumption and subsumption the special 
rule is — una negans esto major vero generalis 

in regard to the first rule or first half of the rule — that one 
or other of the premises should be negative — the reason is mani 
fest for on the doctrine of the logicians the predicate of an 
affirmative proposition is always presumed to be particular con 
sequently in this figure the middle term can on their doctrine 
only be distributed as distributed at least once it must be in a 
negative judgment but on our doctrine on which the predicate 
is quantified in language as in thought this rule is abolished 

the second rule or second moiety of the rule — that the sump 
tion should be always universal — the reason of this is equally 
clear for the logicians not considering that both extremes were 
in equilibrio in the same whole of extension and consequently 
that neither could claim in either quantity the place of major or 
minor term and thereby constitute a true major or a true minor

premise — the logicians i say arbitrarily drew one instead of 
two direct conclusions and gave the name of major term to that 
extreme which formed the predicate in that one conclusion and 
the name of major premise to that antecedent proposition which 
they chose to enounce first on their doctrine therefore the 
conclusion and one of the premises being always negative it 
behoved the sumption to be always general otherwise contrary to 
their doctrine a negative proposition might have a particular pre 
dicate on our doctrine however this difficulty docs not exist 
and the nile is consequently superseded 

in the third figure that is the figure in which the middle 
term is subject of both the extremes the special rule is — sit 
minor ufirmnns conclnsio pahicularis 

here the first half of the rule — that the minor must not be 
negative — is manifestly determined by the common doctrine 
for major and minor terms major and minor propositions being 
in this figure equally arbitrary as in the second here the sumption 
behoving to be affirmative its predicate constituting the major 
term or predicate of the conclusion behoved to be particular also 
but the conclusion following the minor premise would necessarily 
be negative and it would have — what a negative proposition is not 
allowed on the common doctrine — an undistributed predicate 

the second half of the rule — that the conclusion must be 
particular — is determined by the doctrine of the logicians that 
the particular antecedent which they choose to call the minor 
term should be affirmative for in this case the middle term 
being the subject of both premises the predicate of the subsump 
tion is the minor extreme and that on their doctrine not being 
distributed in an affirmative proposition it consequently forms 
the undistributed subject of the conclusion the conclusion 
therefore having a particular subject is on the common doctrine 
a particular proposition but as on our doctrine the predicate 
of an affirmative proposition may have an universal quantification 
the reason fails

middle term which in this figure is always a predicate distributed 
in an afifirmative proposition thus — 

ah p i all m 

all s is some m 

therefore all s is some p 

all the things that are organised are all the things that are endowed 
vnth life 

but all plants are some things endoxoed with life 

therefore all jdanls are some things organised 

this first rule see above vol i p must therefore be thus 
amplified — the middle term must be of definite quantity in 
one premise at least that is it must either “ be a singular — 
individual — concept and therefore identical in both premises or 
° a universal notion presumptively distributed by negation in 
a single premise or ° a universal notion expressly distributetl 
by designation in one or both premises 

but the second rule which has come down from aristotle anel 
is adopted into every system of logic with only one exception an 
ancient scholiast is altogether erroneoua for ° there is pro 
perly no sumption and subsumption in this figure for the 
premises contdn quantities which do not stand to each other in 
any reciprocal relation of greater or less each premise may 
therefore stand first the rule ought to be “ one premise must be 
definite” but such a rule would be idle for what is here given 
as a special canon of this figure was alreiuly given as one of the 
laws of syllogism in general the error in the principle is 
supported by an error in the illustration in both the syllogisms 
given® the conclusion drawn is not that which the piemises war 
rant take the first or affirmative example the conclusion here 
ought to have been no s is some p or some p is no s for 
there arc always two equivalent conclusions in this figure in 
the concrete example the legitimate conclusions as necessitated 
by the premises are — no horse is some animal and some 
animal is no horse this is shown by my mole of explicating

the quantity of the predicate — combined with iny symbolical 
notiition in like manner in the second or negative syllogism the 
conclusion ought to have been either of the two following in the 
abstract formula — all s are not some p or some p are not all 
s — in the concrete example all topazes are not some minerals 
i e no topazes are some minerals or some minerals are not 
all topazes l e some minerals are no topazes 

the moods cesare and camestres may be viewed as really one 
for they are only the same syllogism with premises placed first or 
second as is always allowable in this figure and one of the two 
conclusions which are always legitimately consequential assigned 
to each 

a syllogism in the mood festino admits of either premise being 
placed first it ought therefore to have had another mood for its 
pendant with the affirmative premise first the negative premise 
second if we are to distinguish moods in this figure by the acci 
dental arrangement of the premises but this was prohibited by 
the second law of this figure — that the sumption must always 
be universal let us try this rule in the formula of festino now 
stated reversing the premises 

some s are m l o tome m 

jv’o p m m 

 no p is some s 

 some s ari” no p j 

some actions are praiseworthy 

no lice is jtraiseworthy 

no vice is some action 

some action is no vice 

from what i have now said it will be seen that the dictum de 
omni et de nullo cannot afford the principle of the second figure 

the same errors of the logicians on which i have already com 
mented in supposing that the sumption or major remise in this 
figure must always be universal — an error founded on another 
error that there is properly speaking either sumption or sub 
sumption in this figure at all — this error i say has prevented them 
recognising a mood corresponding to baroco the first premise 
being a particular negative the second a universal affirmative i e 
baroco with its premises reversed that this is competent is

i “ for the unfigured syllogism or that m which the terms 
compared do not stand to each other in the reciprocal relation of 
subject and predicate being in the same proposition either both 
subjects or possibly both predicates — the canon is — in so far 
as two ywtions notions proper or individuals either both cujree or 
one agreeing the utlur does not with a common third notion in 
so far these notions do or do not agree with each other 

ii “ for the figured syllogism in which the terms compared 
are severally subject and predicate consequently in reference to 
each other containing and contained in the counter wholes of in 
tension and extension — the canon is — what worse relation of 
subject and predicate subsists between either of two terms and a 
common third term with which one at least is positirely re 
lated that relation subsists between the two terms themselves 

“ each figure has its own canon 

“first figure — what worse relation of determining jwedi 
cate and of determined subject is held by either of two 
notions to a third with which one at least is positively related 
that relation do they immediately directly hold to each other 
and indirectly mediately its converse 

“second figure — what worse relation of determined sub

at least is positively related that relation do they hold indif 
ferently to each other

 authoe’ doctrine 

aristotle followed by the logicians did not introduce into his 
doctrine of syllogism any quantification between the absolutely 
universal and the merely particular predesignations for valid rea 
sons — ° such quantifications were of no value or application in 
the one whole the universal potential logical or as i would 
amplify it in the two correlative and counter wholes the logical 
and the formal actual metaphysical with which logic is con 
versant for all that is out of classification — all that has no refer 
ence to genus and species is out of logic indeed out of philosophy 
for philosophy tends always to the universal and necessary thus 
the highest canons of deductive reasoning the dicta de omni et 
de nullo were founded on and for the procedure from the uni 
versal whole to the subject parts whilst conversely the principle 
of inductive reasoning was established on and for the real or pre 
sumed collection of all the subject parts as constituting the uni 
versal whole — ° the integrate or mathematical whole on the 
contraiy whether continuous or discrete the philosophers con 
temned for whilst as aristotle observes in mathematics genus 
and species are of no account it is almost exclusively in the 
mathematical whole that quantities are compared together through 
a middle term in neither premise equal to the whole but this 
reasoning in which the middle term is never universal and the

conclusion always particular is — as vagne partial and contingent 
— of little or no value in philosophy it was accordingly ignored 
in logic and the predesignations more most c as i have said 
referred to universal or as was most common to particular or to 
neither quantity® this discrepancy among logicians long ago 
attracted my attention and i saw at once that the possibility of 
inference considered absolutely depended exclusively on the quan 
tifications of the middle term in both premises being together 
more than its possible totality — its distribution in any one at 
the same time i was impressed — ° with the almost utter inutility 
of such reasoning in a phuosophical relation and ° alarmed with 
the load of valid moods which its recognition in logic would in 
troduce the mere quantification of the predicate under the two 
pure quantities of definite and indefinite and the two qualities of 
affirmative and negative gives abstractly in each figure thirty 
six valid moods which if my present ealculation be correct 
would be multiplied by the introduction of the two hybrid or am 
biguous quantifications of a majority and a half to the fearful 
amount of four hundred and eighty valid moods for each figure 
though not at the time fully aware of the strength of these ob 
jections they however prevented me from breaking down the old 
limitation but as my supreme canon of syllogism proceeds on the 
mere formal possibility of reasoning it of course comprehends all 
the legitimate forms of quantification it is — what worst 
relation of subject and predicate subsists between either of two 
terms and a common third term with which one at least is 
positively related — that relation subsists between the two terms 
themselves in other words — n as far as two notions both agree 
or one agreeing the other disagrees with a common third notion 
— in so far those notions agree or disagree with each other this 
canon applies and proximately to all categorical syllogisms — in 
extension and comprehension — affirmative and negative — and of 
any figure it determines all the varieties of such syllogisms is 
developed into all their general and supersedes all their special 
laws in short without violating this canon no categorical rea 
soning can formally be wrong now this canon supposes that

the two extremes are compared together through the same com 
mon middle and this cannot but be if the middle whether sub 
ject or predicate in both its quantifications together exceed its 
totality though not taken in that totality in either premise 

but as have stated i was moved to the reconsideration of this 
whole matter and it may have been mr de morgan’s syllogism 
in our correspondence p which gave the suggestion the 
result was the opinion that these two quantifications should be 
taken into account by logic as authentic forms but then relegated 
as of little use in practice and cumbering the science with a super 
fluous mass of moods” 


author’s docteinb — continued 

no syllogism can be formally wrong in which ° both pre 
mises are not negative and ° the quantifications of the middle 
term whether as subject or predicate taken together exceed the 
quantity of that term taken in its whole extent in the former 
case the extremes are not compared together in the latter they 
are not necessarily compared through the same third these two 
simple rules and they both flow from the one supreme law being 
obeyed no syllogism can be bad let its extremes stand in any 
relation to each other as major and minor or in any relation to 
the middle term in other words its premises may hold any 
mutual subordination and may be of any figure 

on my doctrine figure being only an unessential circumstance 
and every proposition being only an equation of its terms we 
may discount figure c altogether and instead of the symbol 
i marking subject and predicate we might use the alge 
braical sign of equality 

the rule of the logicians that the middle term should be once at 
least distributed or indistributable i e taken universally or sin 
gularly definitely is untrue for it is suificient if in both the 
premises together its quantification be more than its quantity as a 
whole ultratotal therefore a major part a more or most in 
one premise and a half in the other are sufficient to make it effec 
tive it is enough for a valid syllogism that the two extreme notions

l — aristotle 

aristotle prior analytics b ii c after stating that “we 
believe all things either through deductive syllogism or from in 
duction” he goes on to expound the nature of this latter process 

“ now induction and the syllogism from induction is the 
inferring one extreme the major of the middle through the 
other if for instance b is the middle of a c and through c 
we show that a inheres in b thus do we institute inductions 
in illustration — let a be longlived b wantingbile and c 
iidividnal longlived animals as man horse mule c a then 
inheres in the whole of c for all animal without bile is at least 
some longlived but b wanting bile also partially at least 
inheres in all c“ if now c reciprocate with b and do not go 
beyond that middle if c and b subject and predicate are each 


• i have however doubta whether 
the example which now ntanda in the 
organon be that which aristotle him 
eelf proposed it appears at least to 
have been conaiderably modified pro 
bably to bring it nearer to what was 
subsequently supposed to be the truth 
this infer as likely from the commen 
tary of amraonius on the prhr ilna 
occasionally interpolated by and 
thus erroneously quotel under the 
name of a posterior critic — joannes 
sumamed philoponus ac his words 
are in reference to aristotle as follows 
— he wishes through an example to 
illitstrate the inductive process it is of 
this intent let a bo longlived b 
wanting bile q as erowand the like 
now he says — that the crow and the stag 
being animals without bile and long 
lived therefore animal wanting bile is 
longiivecl thus tlirough the last or 
minor do we connect the middle term

alone excluded ® one too of the in 


herents is made to reciprocate with either 
that is with itself or other of the 
two inherents the minor extreme is that 
which on ariatotle’s doctrine of induc 
tion is alone considered as reciprocating 
with the middle or common term but

extreme ” is like vprcurit the pre

term — the emendation is reijuired 
by the demonstration itself to which

a should partially at least inhere in 
all b for whilst a some at least in

their reciprocity inheres in all b a

appendix 


“ this kind of syllogism is of the primary and immediate pro 
position for the reasoning of things mediate is through their 
medium of things immediate through induction and in a cer 
tain sort induction is opposed to the deductive syllogism for 
the latter through the middle term proves the major extreme 
of the third or minor whereas the former through the tliird or 
minor term proves the major extreme of the middle thus 
absolutely in nature the syllogism through a medium is the 
prior and more notorious but relatively to us that through in 
duction is the clearer 

an pr l il c i of example — § “example emerges 
when it is shown that the major extreme inheres in the middle 
by something similar to the third or minor term § 

thus it is manifest that the example does not hold the relation 
either of a whole to part deduction nor of a part to whole 
induction but of part to part when both are contained under 
the same and one is more manifest than the other § and 
example differs from induction in that this from all the indi 
viduals shows that the major extreme inheres in the middle and 
does not like deduction hang the syllogism on the major ex 
treme whereas that both hangs the syllogism on the major ex 
treme and does not show from all the individuals that the major 
extreme is inherent in the minor’’ 

an post l i c § — “the same holds true in the case of 
reasonings whether through deductive syllogisms or through 
induction for both accomplish the instruction they afford from 
information foreknown the former receiving it as it were from the 
tnulition of the intelligent the latter manifesting the universal 
through the light of the individual” pacii p see the rest of 
the chapter 

an pos l i c § — but it is manifest that if 
any sense be wanting some relative science should be wanting 
likewise this it being now impossible for us to apprehend for 
we learn everything either by induction or by demonstration 
now demonstration is from universals and induction from parti 
culars but it is impossible to speculate the universal unless 
through induction seeing that even the products of abstraction 
will become known to us by induction”

these syllogisms though of different figures fall in the same 
mood in our table they are of the eighth mood of the third and 
first figures both unallowed see ramus quoted below p 

the inductive syllogism in the first figure given by schegkius 
pacius the jesuits of coimbra and a host of subsequent repeaters 
is altogether incompetent so far as meant for aristotle’s correla 
tive to his inductive syllogism in the third neither directly nor 
indirectly does the philosopher refer to any inductive reasoning 
in any other figure than the third and he is right for the third 
is the figure in which all the inferences of induction naturally 
run to reduce such reasonings to the first figure far more to the 
second is felt as a contortion as will be found from the two fol 
lowing instances the one of which is aristotle’s example of in 
duction reduced by pacius to the first figure and the other the 
same example reduced by me to the second i have taken care 
also to state articulately what are distinctly thought — the quanti 
fications of the predicate in this reasoning ignored by pacius and 
logicians in general and admitted only on compulsion among 
others by derodon below p and the coimbra commen

duals being often in number infinite there has been found a 
method through which we may accomplish an induction from 
the observation even of a few for after enumerating as many 
as wc can we are entitled to call on our adversary to state on 
his part and to prove any opposing instances should he do 
this then for ‘data instantia cadit inductio’ he prevails but 
should he not then do we succeed in our induction but induction 
is brought to bear in the third figure for in this figure is it origi 
nally cast should then the minor premise be converted so that 
the middle be now predicated of all the minor extremes as that 
extreme was predicated of all the middle in that case the con 
clusion will be not of some but of all in induction the first 
figure therefore arises from conversion — from conversion of the 
minor premise — and this too converted into all and not into 
some but an inductive syllogism is drawn in the third figure 
as follows — let it be supposed that we wish to prove — every 
animal moves the lower jaw with that intent we place as 
terms — the major moves the under jaw the minor azf ani 
mal and lastly the middle all contained under aninud so that 
these contents reciprocate with all animal and it is thus perfected 
 in the first figure as follows — to move the lower jaw is predi 
cated of all individual animals these all are predicated of all 
animal therefore moving the lower jaw is predicated of all ani 
mal in such sort induction is accomplished”

manner — fire air water and eaiih are bodies hut fire air 
water and earth are every element therefore every element is

v— the college of alcala 

a curious error in regard to the contrast of the inductive and 
the deductive syllogism stands in the celebrated cursus complu 
tensis — in the disputations on aristotle’s dialectic by the car 
melite college of alcala l iil c we there find sur 
rendered aristotle’s distinctions as accidental induction and 
deduction are recognised each as both ascending and descending 
as both from and to the whole the essential difference between 
the processes being taken in the existence of a middle term for 
deduction in its nonexistence for induction the following is 
given as an example of the descending syllogism of induction — 
all men are animals therefore this and this and this dcman 
is an animal an ascending inductive syllogism is obtained from 
the preceding if reversed now all this is a mistake the syllo 
gism here stated is deductive the middle minor and major 
terms the minor premise and the conclusion being confounded 
together expresscd as it ought to be the syllogism is as follows — 
all men are some animals this and this and this dc are 
cotistitute all men therefore this and this and this dc are 
some animal here the middle term and three propositions re 
appear whilst the deductive syllogism in the first figure yields of 
course on its reversal an inductive syllogism in the third

the vulgar errors those till latterly at least prevalent in this 
country — that induction is a syllogism in the mood barbara of 
the first figure with the minor or the major premise usually sup 
pressed and still more that from a eome in the antecedent we 
can logically induce an all in the conclusion — these on their own 
account are errors now hardly deserving of notice and have been

of a class or genus through induction there is no doubt that 
this succeeds so soon as the induction is complete or so soon as we 
have ascertained that the class or species a contains under it no 

other cases than c d e f m and that the attribute b occurs

the only inducement to the disjunctive form is that the predicate 
is exhausted without the predesignation of universality and the 
first figure attained but as these crotchets have been here 
refuted therefore the more natural c 

some logicians as oxford crakanthorpe logica iii c 
published but written long before hold that induction can 
only be recalled to a hypothetical syllogism as — sopftocles 
be risible likeivise plato and all other men then all man is risible 
but socrates is risible likewise plato and all other men therefore 
all man is risible against the categorical syllogism in one or 
other figure he argues — “ this is not a universal categorical because 
both the premises are singular nor a singular categorical because 
the conclusion is universal” it is sufficient to say that though 
the subjects of the premises be singular crakanthorpe does 
not contemplate their being particular as supposed to be all the 
constituents of a species or relatively universal whole they are 
equivalent to that species their universality though contrary to 
aristotle’s canon is indeed overtly declared in one of the pre 
mises by the universal predesignation of the predicate our 
author further adds that induction cannot be a categorical syl 
logism because it contains four terms this quatemity being

 thu here said of uie major

inductive syllogism should be drawn 
in a disjunctive form — was commonly 
held especially by the scholastic com 
mentators on petrus hispanus thus 
versor to take the books at hand 
whose expitim first appeared in 
says — “ in the fourth place induction 
is thus reduced to syllogism seeing that 
in the conclusion of the induction there 
are two terms of which the subject forms 
the minor and the predicate the major 
extreme in the syllogism whilst the 
singulars which have no place in the 
conclusion constitute the middle term 
thus the induction — socraie miw

immense majority hold them to be mediate a small minority of 
which i recollect only the names of kant fischer weiss bouter 
wek herbart hold them to be immediate 

the dispute is solved by a distinction categorical inference is 
mediate the medium of conclusion being a term the hypothetical 
and disjunctive syllogisms are mediate the medium of conclusion 
being a proposition — that which i call the explication so far 
they both agree in being mediate but they differ in four points 
the first that the medium of the comparative syllogism is a term 
of the explicative a proposition the second that the medium of 
the comparative is one of the explicative more than one the 
third that in the comparative the medium is always the same in 
the explicative it varies according to the various conclusion the 
fourth that in the comparative the medium never enters the con 
clusion whereas in the explicative the same proposition is reci 
procally medium or conclusion

few have held them to be more simple this dispute arises from 
each party taking a partial or onesided view of the two classes 
in one point of view the explicative are the more complex the 
comparative the more simple in another point of view the 
reverse holds good 


our hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms may be reduced 
to the class of explicative or conditional the hypotheticals 
should be called as they were by boethius and others con 
junctive in contrast to the coordinate species of disjunctive 
hypothetical as a name of the species ought to be abandoned 

the conjunctives are conditional inasmuch as negation or affir 
mation is not absolutely asserted but left alternative and the quality 
of one proposition is made dependent on another they are how 
ever not properly stated the first proposition — that contain 
ing the condition — which i would call the erplicand should be 
thus enounced s b so a — or as b is so is a or as c is 
b so is b a then follows the proposition containing the expli 
cation which i would call the explicative and finally the 
proposition embodying the result which i would call the ex 
plicate 

they are called conjunctives from their conjoining two con 
vertible propositions in a mutual dependence of which either may 
be made antecedent or consequent of the other 

disjunctive syllogisms are conditional inasmuch as a notion is 
not absolutely asserted as subject or predicate of another or others 
but alternatively conjoined with some part but only with some 
part of a given plurality of notions the affinnation of it with one 
part involving its negation with the others the first proposition 
containing the condition i would call the explicand and so forth 
as in the conjunctives they are properly calleil disjunctives

as the reasoning is determined a to one or b to one or other 
conclusion it is manifest that this latter division may constitute

hypothetical syllooism— canon 

oct — canon — two or more propositions thought as in 
determined in quality but as in quality mutually dependent the 


 



appendix 


 


determination of quality in the one infers a determination of the 
corresponding quality in the other 

this canon embodies and simplifies the whole mystery of hy 
pothetical syllogisms which have been strangely implicatetl muti 
lated and confusetl by the logicians 

° what are called hypothetical propositions and syllogisms 
are no more hypothetical than others they are only hypothetical 
as elliptical when we say if a is then b is we mean to say 
the proposition a is or is not and the proposition b is or is 
not are mutually dependent — that as the one so the other if here 
only means taking for the nonce one of the qualities to the exclu 
sion of the other i therefore express in my notation the connec 
tion of the antecedent and consequent of a hypothetical proposition 
thus — 


° the interdependent propositions are erroneously called ante 
cedent and consequent either is antecedent either is consequent 
as we choose to make them neither is absolutely so this error 
arose from not expressing overtly the quantity of the subject of the 
second proposition for example if man is then animal is in 
this proposition as thus stated the negation of the first does not 
infer the negation of the second for man not existing animal 
might be realised as a consequent of dog horse c but let us 
consider what we mean we do not mean all animal but some 
only and that some determined by the attribute of rationality or 
such other now this same some animal depends on man and 
man on it expressing therefore what we mean in the proposition 
thus — if all nuin is then some animal is — we then see the mutual 
dependence and convertibility of the two propositions® for to say 
that no animal is is not to explicate but to change the terms 

° the interdependent propositions may be dependent through 
their counter qualities and not merely through the same for 
example as our hemisphere is or is not illuminated so the other 
is not or is but the other is not illuminated therefore ours is 
another if a is then b is not but b is therefore a is not

disjunctive and hypothetical syllogisms proper 

aristotle ignores these forms and be was right® his followers 
tlieoplirastus and eudenius with the stoics introduced them into 
logic as coordinate with the regular syllogism and their views 
have been followed with the addition of new errors up to the pre 
sent hour in fact all that has been said of them has been wrong 

 these arc not composite by contrast to the regular syllogism 
but more simple 

° if inferences at all these arc immediate and not mediate 

° but they are not argumentations but preparations explica 
tions for argumentation they do not deal with the quresitum — 
do not settle it they only put the question in the state required 
for the syllogistic process this indeed they are frequently used 
to supersede as placing the matter in a light which makes denial or 
doubt impossible and their own process is so evident that they 
might except for the sake of a logical an articulate development 
of all the steps of thought be safely omitted as is the case with the

 hypothetical so called syllogism let the qumsitum or pro 
blem be to take the simplest instance — doen animal exist i tliia 
question is thus hypothetically prepared — if vian is animal is 
but as is conceded man is therefore animal is but here the 
question though prepared is not solved for the opponent may 
deny the consequent admitting the antecedent it therefore is 
incumbent to show that the existence of animal follows that of 
nan which is done by a categorical syllogism 

animal — man ¦ existent 


 disjunctive so called syllogism problem — is john mortal 
disjunctive syllogism — john is either mortal or immortal but 
he is not immortal ergo and this consequently is admitted as a 
neecssary alternative he is mortal but the alternative ante 
cedent may be denied and the alternative consequent falls to the 
ground it is therefore necessary to show either that he is not 
immortal or — the necessary alternative — that he is mortal which 
is done by categorical syllogism

hypothetical inference 

inasmuch as a notion is thought it is thought either as existing 
or as nonexisting and it cannot be thought as existing unless it be 
thought to exist in this or that mode of being which consequently 
affords it a ground condition or reason of existence this is 
merely the law of reason and consequent and the hypothetical 
inference is only the limitation of a supposed notion to a certain 
mode of ijcing by which if posited its existence is affirmed if 
sublated its existence is denied for examjle if k is it is b hut 
a is c 

again we may think the existence of b consequently of a b 
as dependent upon c and c as dependent upon d and so forth 
we accordingly may reason if a is b and b is c and c is d c

as determined by one or other and only by one or other of any 
two eontradietory attributes and in as mueh as two notions are 
thought as contradictory the one or the other and only the one 
or the other is thought as a determining attribute of any other 
notion this is merely the law of excluded middle the dis 
junctive inference is the limitation of a subject notion to the one or 
to the other of two predicates thought as contradictories the 
affirmation of the one inferring the negation of the other and 
vice verstl as a is either b or not b c though for the 
sake of brevity we say a is either b or c or d each of these 
must be conceived as the contradictory of every other as b 
c i d and so on with the others 

hypotheticus conjunctive and distunctive syllogism 

april — these syllogisms appear to be only modifica 
tions or corruptions of certain immediate inferences for they have 
only two terms and obtain a third jiroposition only by placing 
the general rule of inference stating of course the possible alter 
natives disguised it is true as the major premise it is manifest 
that we might prefix the general rule to every mediate inference 
in which case a syllogism wotdd have four propositions or at 
least both premises merged in one complex proposition thus — 

if a and c br either subject or predicate of the same term they are 
both stibject or jrredicate of each other 

but b is the subject of a and predicate of b c 

 a is the predicate of c“ 

thus also a common hypothetical should have only two proposi 
tions let us take the immediate inference prefixing its rule and 
we have in all essentials the cognate hypothetical syllogism 

 — conjunctive hyjjothetical 

alt b it some all a a u men are some animals 

home or all b exists a ll or some men exist 

therefore some a exists therefore some animals exist

hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms 

 or — the whole antecedent must be granted and 
there cannot be two propositions inferred in categorical syllo 
gisms the antecedent is composed of the major and minor premises 
and there is only one simple conclusion though this may in the 
second and third figures vary so in hypothetical and disjunc 
tive syllogisms the whole antecedent is the two clauses of the 
first proposition and the whole inference is the first and second 
clauses of the second proposition erroneously divided into minor 
proposition and conclusion 

january — the medium or explicative may be indefinitely 
various according to the complexity of the explicand and so may 
the explicate the explicative and the explicate change places 
in difl’erent explications there is in fact no proper medium 
explicative or conclusionexplicate 

january — in disjunctives there is always at least double 
the number of syllogisms positive and negative of the disjunct 
members and in all syllogisms where the disjunct members are 
above two as there is thus afiforded the possibility of disjunctive

 in hypotheticals conjunctive and disjunctive two or three 
hypotheses tlie first is in the original supposition of possibi 
lity if b he a it is not non a — if b be either a or non a 
the second and third is in the alternative suppositions of actua 
lity • either if b be a it is not nona or if b be nona it is 
not a — if b be a it is iot nona or if b he nona it is not 
a possibly — by possible supposition if man is animal is 

actually man being animal is or animal not being man 
is not 

 possibility — a genus indifferent to negative and affirmative 
these two species of possibility to wit two actuals — an actual yes 
and an actual no the total formal conclusion is therefore of 
two contradictories this explains why in conjunctive and dis 
junctive hypotheticals there are two alternative consequents and 
only one antecedent 

 in hypotheticals conjunctive and disjunctive a division of 
genus in the first supposition into two contradictories — species 
the inference therefore one of subaltemation or restriction 

 in hypotheticals conjunctive and disjunctive two alter 
native contradictory conclusions — the fonn giving no preference 
between the two the matter only determining other immediate 
inferences have only one determinate conclusion and all mediate 
syllogism has virtually only one formally therefore we cannot 
categorically detenu inatcly assert and assert exclusively either 
alternative and make a minor separate from the conclusion this 
only materially’ possible for we know not by the laws of thought 
whether a certain alternative is knowuig only that one of two 
alternatives niust be formally therefore only an immediate 
inference and that alternative double 

 hypothetical conjunctive and disjunctive reasoning more 
marking out — predetermining how a thing is to be proved 
than proving it 

 thus three classes of inference “ simple immediate in 
ference — ° complex immediate inference hypotheticals con 
junctive and disjunctive — ° syllogisms proper mediate infer 
ence 

 if we quantify the terms even the formal inference breaks 
down 

 the only difference between the first proposition and the

therefore be reduceil to one and made a conclusion or restriction 
the genera and species are of the most common and notorious 
kinds as posnble and actunl — whereitr here c — whenever 
nmo — all or evcr some this c the commonness and noto 
riety of this subordination is the cause why it has not been sig 
nalised and if signalised and overtly expressed hypotheticals 
might be turned into categoricals it is better however to leave 
them as immediate inferences for it would be found awkward 
and roundabout to oppose for example the possible to the 
actual as determining a difference of terms see imolinajus elem

 possibly — problematically includes as species the actual 
affirmative and the actual negative it will thus be superfluous 
to enounce a negative in opjwsition to an affirmative alternative 
for thus the possible would be brought down to the actual and 
the whole syllogism be mere tautological repetition 

 the quantified terms if introduced must either be made 
determinate to suit the hypotheticals or must ruin their infer 
ence for example — if all or some man be some animal we 
must be able to say but some animal is not therefore man 
any or some is not but here some animal except definitised 
into the same some animal would not warrant the required infer

proposition with the conclusion proper but it will not be one and

if there were no alternation the inference would follow imme

not make a mediate inference 

to make one alternative determinate is extralogical for it is 
true only as materially proved ° the splitting therefore of the 
conclusive proposition into two — a minor and a conclusion proper 
is wholly material and extralogical so also ° is the multiply

the vocative the imperative the interrogative the optative and 
the enunciative or lissertive — having further stated the corres 
ponding division by the stoics ami having finally shown tliat 
aristotle in this book limited the discussion to the last kind that 
alone being recipient of truth and falsehood he thus proceeds — 
‘‘again oi assertive speech airoffiavtikov xoyov there are two 
species the one called categoric or predicative the other 
ii gpothetic or suppositive the categoric denotes that some 
thing does or does not belong to something as when we say 
socrates is walking socrates is not walking for we predi 
cate walking of socrates sometimes affirmatively sometimes nega 
tively tlie hypothetic denotes that something being something 
else is or is not or something not being something else is 
not or is as wlien we say if man be animal also is — if he 
be man he is not stone — if it be not dag it is night — if it be 
not day the sun has not risen 

“ the categoric is the only species of assertive speech treated 
of by aristotle as that alone perfect in itself and of utility in 
demonstration whereas hypothetic syllogisms usurping usually 
without demonstration the minor proposition called the tran 
sumption or assumption and sometimes even a major premise 
conjunctive or disjunctive requiring proof draw their persuasion 
from hypotheses sliould any one i read ii ti for ti con 
cede their primary siippositioms if then to the establishment of 
such suppositions we should employ a second hypothetic syllo 
gism — in that case we should require a further establislimcnt 
for confirmation of the suppositions involved ui it for this 
third a fourth would again be necessary and so on to infinity 
should we attempt by hypotheses to confirm hypotheses but 
to render the demonstration complete and final it is manifest 
that there is needed a categoric syllogism to prove the point in 
question without any foregone supposition hence it is that 
categoric reasonings are styled syllogisms absolutely whereas 
hypothetic reasonings of every kind are always denominated 
syllogisms from hypothesis and never syllogisms simply add 
to this that hypothetic enouncements are made up of categoric 
for they express the consequence or opposition akoovlav rj

all logicians have overlooked the sorites of second and third 
figures 

in sorites of the second or tliird figure every tenn forms a 
syllogism with every other through the one middle tenn in 
sorites of the first figure every second term at most forms a 
syllogism with every other through its relative middle term 

no subordination in sorites of second or third figure ergo 
no one dominant conclusion 

alias in first figure there being a subordination of notions 

there may be a sorites with different middles all however in a 
common dependency in second and third figures there being 
no subordination of terms the only sorites competent is that by 
repetition of the same middle in first figure there is a new 
middle term for every new progress of the sorites in second and 
third only one middle term for any number of extremes 

in first figure a syllogism only between every second term of 
the sorites the intermediate term constituting the middle term 
in the others every two propositions of the common middle term 
form a syllogism 

alias — there being no subordination in second and third 
figures between the extremes there consequently are —

term

•which we are hereafter to treat in reference to reasoning in 
general there are two kinds of sorites the’one descending from 
whole to part — or ascending from part to whole the other pro 
ceeding from whole to whole of which last it is now alone reciui 
site to speak it is manifest that if we can find two notions 
wholly equal to a third notion these notions will be wholly 
equal to each other thus if all trilateral figure be identical ¦with 
all triangular figure and all triangular figure with all figure the 
sum of whose internal angles is equal to two right angles then all 
figure the sum of whose internal angles is equal to two right 
angles and all trilateral figure will also be identical reciprocating 
or absolutely convertible we have thus a siinjile syllogism of 
absolute equation on the same principle if a and b b and c 
c and d are absolutely ejuivalent so also will be a and d we 
may thus in like manner it is evident have a sorites of absolute 
equivalence it is not indeed very easy always to find four or 
more terms or notions thus simply convertible in geometry we 
may carry out the concrete syllogism just stated by adding the 
three following propositions — all figure the sum of whose inter 
nal angles is equal to two right angles is all figure which can he 
bisected through only one angle — all figure which canbe bisected 
through only one angle is all figure which bisected through an 
angle and a side gives two triangles and all figure which thus 
bisected gives two triangles is all figure which bisected through 
two sides gives a triangle and a quadrangle and so forth in 
theology jerhaps however these series are more frequently to be 
found than in the other sciences the following twelve ecjuivaleiit 
concepts constitute at once a good example of such a sorites and 
at the same time exhibit a compendious view of the whole calvin 
istic doctrine tliese are — elected — eedeemcd — called — 
 graced with true repentance — with true faith — with 
true personal assurance — pardoned — justified — sancti 
fied — endowed with perseverance — saved — glorified 
this series could indeed be amplified but i have puqjosely re 
stricted it to twelve now as all the elect are all the redeemed 
all the redeemed all the ctdled all the called all the truly 
penitent all the trtdy jenitent all the truly believing all the

all the glorijied all the blest with life eternal it follows of ne 
cessity that all the blest rvith life eternal are all the elect to 
tnm this affirmative into a negative sorites we have only to say 
cither at the beginning — none of the reprobate are any of the 
elect and consequently infer at the end that none of the blessed 
with eternal life are an y of the reprobale or at the end — none of 
the blessed with eternal life are any of the punished and conse 
quently infer that none of the punished are any of the elect per 
haps the best fonnula for this kind of sorites is to be found in the 
letters a b c this will afford us a sorites of six terms viz a 

b c — a c b — b a c — b c a — c a b — c b a — which are all vir 
tually identical in their contents if there be rtspiired a formula 
for a longer sorites we may take the letters a b c d which will 
afford us twentyfour terms perhaps the best formula for a de 
scending or ascending scjritos is for example a b o d e f — a b

 enouncement of syllogism 

nov — there are two orders of enouncing the syllogism 
both natural and the neglect of these added to the not taking 
into account the problem or question has been the ground why 
the doctrine of syllogism has been attacked as involving a petitio 
prindpii or as a mere tautology thus buffier cites the defi 
nition the art of confessing in the conclusion what has been al 
ready avowed in the premises this objection has never been 
put down 

the foundation of all syllogism is the problem but this may 
be answered either analytically or synthetically 

i analyticedhj which has been wholly overlooked thus — pro 
blem or qiuesitum s p c answer p is c for p is m and 
m is c this in the reasoning of depth more explicitly — does 
p contain in it cl p contains ii it c for p contains in it m 
and m contains in it c but it is wholly indifferent whether we 
cast it in the reasoning of breadth for example — does c con 
tain under p c contains under it p for c contains under 
it m and m contains under it p 

here all is natural and there is no hitch no transition in the 
order of progressive statement the whole reasoning forms an 
organic unity all the parts of it being present to the mind at 
once there is no before and no after but it is the condition of a 
verbal enouncement that one part should precede and follow 
another here accordingly the proposition in which the reason

ing is absolveil or realised and which from the ordinary mode of 
enouncement has been styled the conclusion ls stated first and 
the grounds or reasons on which it rests which from the same cir 
cumstance have been called the premise or antecedent are stated 
last this order is analytic we proceed from the effect to the 
cause — from the principiatum to the principia and it is evident 
that this may be done indifferently either in depth or breadth 
the only diflerence being that in the counter quantities the grounds 
or premises naturally change their order 

ii synthetically — the only order contemplated by the logicians 
as natural but on erroneous grounds on the contrary if one 
order is to be accounted natural at the expense of the other it is 
not that which has thus been exclusively considered for — 

° it is full of hitches there is one great hitch in the separa 
tion of the conclusion from the question though this latter is 
merely the former proxsition in an assertive instead of an inter 
rogative form there is also at least one subordinate hitch in 
the evolution of the reasoning 

° the exclusive consideration of this form has been the cause or 
the occasion of much misconception idle disputation and ground 
less objection 


on the two methods tumultuary observations to be better 
arranged and corrected 

° in the first or analytic order what is principal in reality and 
in interest is placed first that is the answer or assertion called on 
the other order the conclusion 

° in this order all is natural there is no hitch no saltus no 
abrupt transition all slides smoothly from first to last 

a the question slides into its answer interrogation demands 
and receives assertion 

b assertion requires a reason and prepares us to expect it 
and this is given immediately in what from the other order has 
been called the a ntecedent or premises 

c then the first term either in breadth or depth is taken first 
in the ground or reason and compared with m then m is com 
pared with the other as in breadth — does c contain under it 
r c contains f for c contains under it m and m contains 
under it f — in depth — does f contain in it cl t contains in

it c for r contains in it m and m contains in it c this is the 
first figure — second figure using common language — is f c 
f is c and c is f for f and c are both the same m here 
the two extremes taken together are compared with m — in the 
third figure m is compared with both extremes — is f c f is 
c and m is f for the same hi is both f and c 

° in this order there is nothing pleonastic nothing anticipated 

° nothing begged 

° in this method the process is simple thought is one but 
to be enounced it must be analysed into a many this order 
gives that necessary analysis and nothing more 

g’ in this order when assertive answer is limited by ques 
tion good reason why in second and third figures one answer 
should be given 

° this order is the one generally used by the mathematicians 
see twesten logik insbesondere die analitik p 
and below p plato also 

° if the qumsitum be stated as it ought to be this order 
follows of course and the neglect of the qumsitum has followed 
from the prevalence of the other if the qumsitum be stated in 
using the common form we must almost of course interpolate a 
yes or a no before proceeding to the premises in the common 
method and in that case the conclusion is only a superfluous 
recapitulation 

in the synthetic or common order all is contrary the num 
bers correspond 

° in this order what is first in reality and interest and in 
and for the sake of which the whole reasoning exists comes last 
till the conclusion is given we know not at least we ought not to 
know how the question is answered 

° in this order all is unnatural and contorted by hitches and 
abrupt transitions there is no connection between the question 
and what prepares the answer — the premise show in detail 

° in this order all is pleonastic and anticipative the pre 
mises stated we already know the conclusion this indeed in 
books of logic is virtually admitted — the conclusion being com 
monly expressed by a therefore c ancient doctrine of enthy 
meme ulpianc unknown to our modem logicians among their

other blunders on the enthymeme on the common doctrine 
logic — syllogistic — is too truly defined the art of confessing in 
the conclusion what had been already avowed in the premises 

° on this order the objection of petitio principu stands 
hitherto unrefuted if not unrefutable against logic 

° in this order the process is complex the simple thought 
is first mentally analysed if it proceed as it ought from the quse 
situm but this analysis is not expressed then the elements are 
recomposed and this recomposition affords the synthetic an 
nouncement of the syllogism — the syllogism being thus the super 
fluous regress of a foregone analysis aristotle’s analytic is thus 
truly a synthetic it overtly reconstructs the elements which had 
been attained by a covert analysis 

° in this method the problem hanging loose from the syllo 
gism and in fact being usually neglected it does not determine 
in the second and third figures one of the two alternative con 
clusions which ex facie srjuogismi are competent in them the 
premises only being there is no reason why one of the conclu 
sions should be drawn to the preference of the other mem 
counterpractice old and new the logicians ought not however 
to have ignored this double conclusion

appendix 


in his mode of enouncement this relative order is naturally 
kept for he expresses the predicate first and the subject last 
thus a ts in all b or a is predicated of all b instead of 
saying aw b ts a 

but when logicians came to enounce propositions and syllogisms 
in conformity to common language the subject being usually first 
they had one or other of two difficulties to encounter and submit 
they must to either for they must either displace the middle term 
from its intermediate position in the first figure to say nothing 
of reversing its order in the second and third or if they kept it 
in an intermediate position in the first figure in the second and 
third the arlstotelic order could not be kept it behoved them to 
enounce the minor premise first 

and this alternative actually determined two opposite procedures 
— a difference which though generally distinguishing the logicians 
of different ages and countries into two great classes has been 
wholly overlooked all it must be borne in mind regard the 
syllogism in figure exclusively and as figured only in extension 

the former difficulty and its avoidance determined the older 
order of enouncement that is constrained logicians to state the 
minor premise first in the first figure and to avoid the discre 
pancy they of course did the same for uniformity in the second 
and third such is the order 

the latter difficulty and its avoidance determined the more 
modem order of enouncement that is constrained logicians to 
surrender the position of the middle term as middle in following 
the order of the major premise first in all the figures 

philoponus on the first book of the prior a nalytics c iv § 
pacian division f xx ed trincavelli — “ tiiis definition ap 
pears to be of the extremes and of the middle term but is not 
it behoves in addition to interpolate in thought an only’ and 
thus will it be rightly enounced as if he had said • — bid the ex 
tremes are both that which is only in another and that in which 
another only is for if a is predicated of all b and b is pre 
dicated of all c it is necessary that a should be predicated of all 
c this is the first syllogistic mood two universal affirmatives 
inferring an universal conclusion for if b is in all c conse 
quently c is a part of b but again b is a part of a consequently 


 


appendix 


 


a is in all c inasmuch as c is a part of b but what is here 
said will appear more clearly from a concrete example — sub 
stance oj all animal animal of all man there follows sub 
stance of all num and backwards avanaxtvj all man ani 
mal all animal substance all man therefore substance in 
regard to this figure it is plain how we ought to take the terms 
of the first mood tlie first major is most generic the second 
middle is a subaltern genus and the third minor is a species 
more special than the middle but a conclusion is here always 
necessary thus following the synthetic order that is if we start 
from the major term substance begins beginning also the con 
clusion substance of all animal substance stands first animal 
of all man finally the conclusion commences with substance — 
substance of all man but if on the analytic order we depart 
from the minor term as from man in this case the conclusion

immediate its indirect or mediate conclusion these two various 
forms of syllogism are essentially one and the same differing only 
accidentally in the order of enouncement inasmuch as they seve

whola but in fact we may enounce each order of syllogism 
in either quantity the one is the more natural 

second and third figures — in each of these figures there are 
possible the two varieties of syllogism but not as in the first 
figure are these different forms variable by a counter quantity and 
with a determinate major and minor term for in each the ex 
tremes and the middle term there opposed are necessarily in the 
same quantity being either always subject or always predicate 
in the jugation they differ only as the one extreme or the other 
what is indifferent is arbitrarily made the subject or predicate 
in the conclusion indirect or mediate conclusions in these 
figures are impossible for the indirect or mediate conclusion of 
the one syllogism is in fact the direct conclusion of the other

if rule true it will follow that it is of no consequence whether — 

 the middle one or any other of the three terms be in any 
proposition subject or predicate if only either hence difference 
of figure of no account in varying the syllogism thus retain 
ing the subordination of temis convert major proposition in ex 
tension of first figure and you have second figure convert 
minor proposition and you have third figure convert both pre 
mises and you have fourth figure 

° whether one of the extremes one or other of the premises 
stand first or second be in fact major or minor term of a propo 
sition all that is required is that the tenns and their quantities 
should remain the same and that they should always bear to each 
other a relation of subject and predicate thus if in any of the 
figures the major and minor terms and propositions interchange 
relation of subordination when in the first figure you convert 
and transpose and when in the other three figures fourth 
you simply transpose the premises 

indifferent in first figure which premise precedes or follows 
for of two one not before the other in nature but not indiffer 
ent in either whole which term should be subject and predicate 
of conclusion 

 double conclusion in second and third figuees 

my doctrine is as follows — 

in the uvfffured syllogism there is no contrast of terms the 
notions compared not being to each other subject and predicate 
consequently the conclusion is here necessarily one and only one 

in the figured syllogism we must discriminate the figures 

in the first figure where the middle term is subject of the one 
extreme and predicate of the other there is of course a determinate 
major extreme and premise and a determinate minor extreme and 
promise consequently also one proximate or direct and one remote 
or indirect conclusion — the latter by a conversion of the former

in the second and third figures all this is reversed in these 
there is no major and minor extreme and premise both extremes 
being either subjects or predicates of the middle consequently 
in the inference as either extreme may be indifterently subject or 
predicate of the other there are two indifl’erent conclusions that 
is conclusions neither of which is more direct or indirect than the 
other 

this doctrine is opposed to that of aristotle and the logicians 
who recognise in the second and tliird figures a major and minor 
extreme and premise with one determinate conclusion 

the whole question in regard to the duplicity or simplicity of 
the conclusion in the latter figures depends upon the distinction 
in them of a major and a minor tenu and it must be peremp 
torily decided in opposition to the universal doctrine unless it can 
be shown that in these figures tliis distinction actually subsists 
this was felt by the logicians accordingly they applied themselves 
with zeal to establish this distinction but it would apiear from 
the very multiplicity of their opinions that none proved satisfac 
tory and this general presumption is shown to be correct by the 
examination of these opinions in detail — an examination which 
evinces that of these opinions there is no one which ought to 
satisfy an inquiring mind 

in all there are six or five different grounds on which it has 
been attempted to establish the discrimination of a major and 
minor term in the second and third figures all are mutually 
subversive each is incompetent each following the first is in 
fact a virtual acknowledgment that the reason on which aristotle 
proceeded in this establishment is at once ambiguous and insuffi 
cient i shall enumerate these opinions as nearly as possible in 
chronological order 

 tjuit the major is the extreme which lies in the second 
figure nearer to in the third figure farther from the middle — 
this is aristotle’s definition an fr l i cc at best it 
is ambiguous and has accordingly been taken in iliflerent senses 
by following logicians and in treating of them it will be seen 
that in none except an arbitrary sense can the one extreme in 
these figures be considered to lie nearer to the middle term than 
the other i exclude the supposition that aristotle spoke in 
reference to some scheme of mechanical notation

 that the major term in the antecedent is that which is pre 
dicate in the conclusion — this doctrine dates from a remote an 
tiquity it is rejected by alexander but adopted by ammonius 
and philoponus f b a ed trina has been generally 
recognised by subsequent logicians its recognition is now almost 
universal yet critically considered it explains nothing educing 
the law out of the fact and not deducing the fact from the law it 
does not even attempt to show why one being either extreme may 
not be predicate of the conclusion it is merely an empirical — 
merely an arbitrary assertion the aphrodisian after refuting 
the doctrine when the terms are indefinite preindesignate justly 
says — “nor is the case difierent when the terms are definite 
predesignate for the conclusion shows as predicate the term 
given as major in the premises so that the conclusion is not itself 
demonstrative of the major on the contrary the being tsiken in 
the premises as major is the cause why a term is also taken as 
predicate in the conclusion” — an pr f a ed aid 

 that the proximity of an extreme to the middle term in 
logic is to be decided by the relative proximity in nature to the 
middle notion of the notions compared this which is the inter 
pretation of aristotle by herminus is one of the oldest upon re 
cord being detailed and refuted at great length by the aphrodi 
sian f b a to determine the natural proximity re 
quired is often difficult in affinnative and always impossible in 
negative syllogism and besides the objections of alexander it is 
wholly material and extralogical it is needless to dwell on this 
opinion which obscure in itself seems altogether unknown to our 
modern logicians 

 that the major term in the syllogism is the predicate of 
the problem or question this is the doctrine maintained by 
alexander f b but it is doubtful whether at first or second 
hand it has been adopted by averroes zabarella and simdry of 
the acuter logicians in modem times it is incompetent however 
to establish the discriminatiom material it presupposes an inten 
tion of the reasoner does not appear ex facie syllogismi and at 
best only shows which of two possible qumsita — which of two 
possible conclusions — has been actually carried out for it as 
sumes that of the two extremes either might have been major in 
the antecedent and predicate in the conclusion if alexander

had applied the same subtlety in canvassing his own opinion 
which he did in criticising those of others he would not have 
given the authority of his name to so untenable doctrine 

 that the major extreme is that contained in the major pre 
mise and the major premise that in the order of enouncement 
first this doctrine seems indicated by scotus an pr l l 
qu xxiv §§ and is held explicitly by certain of his fol 
lowers this also is wholly incompetent for the order of 
the premises as the subtle doctor himself observes qu 
xxiii § is altogether indifferent to the validity of the con 
sequence and if this external accident be admitted we should 
have greek majors and minors turned presto into latin minors 
and majors 

 that the major extreme is that contained in the major pre 
mise and the major premise that itself most general all oppo 
site practice originates in abuse this opinion which coincides 
with that of herminus no in making the logical relation of 
terms dependent on the natural relation of notions i find ad 
vanced in in the disputationes of an ingenious and inde 
pendent philosopher the spanish jesuit petrus hurtado de men 
doza disp log et met l disp x §§ — it is however 
too singular and manifestly too untenable to require refutation 
as material it is illogical as formal if allowed it would at best 
serve only for the discrimination of certain moods but it cannot 
be allowed for it would only subvert the old without being ade 
quate to the establishment of aught new it shows however how 
unsatisfactory were the previous theories when such a doctrine 
could be proposed by so acute a reasoner in substitution this 
opinion has remained unnoticed by posterior logicians 

the dominant result from this historical enumeration is that 
in the second and third figures there is no major or minor term 
therefore no major or minor premise therefore two indifferent 
conclusiona

seem when fully developed has but few and obscure vaticinations

major and minor term in the second figure nor by analogy in the 
third was a doctrine actually held by some early greek logicians 
it would be curious to know if these were the “ ancients assailed 
by ammonius for maintaining an overt quantification of the pre 
dicate the words of alexander are — “ nor however can it be 
said that in the present figure there is no major for this at least 
is determinate — that its major must be universal and if there be 
in it any syllogistic combination that premise is the major which 
contains the major term ’’ £ a demurring to this refuta 
tion it is however evidence suflficient of the opinion to which it 
is opposed this as it is the oldest is indeed the only authority 
for any deliberate doctrine on the point 

the second indication dates from the middle of the fifteentli 
century and is contained in the dialecttca of the celebrated lau 
rentius valla l iil c valla abolishes the third figure and 
his opinion on the question is limited to his observations on the 
second in treating of cesare and camestres which after a host 
of previous logicians he considers to be a single mood there is 
nothing remarkable in his statement “ neque distincue sunt pro 
positio et assumptio ut altera major sit altera minor sed quodam 
modo pares ideoque sicut neutra rindicat sibi prinium aut secun 
dum locum ita utraque jus habet in utraque conclusione verum 
istis placuit ut id quod secundo loco poneretur vendicaret sibi con 
clusionem quod verum esset nisi semper gemina esset conclusio 
sed earum dicamus alteram ad id quod primo loco alteram ad id 
quod secundo loco positum est referri” we therefore await the 
development of his doctrine by relation to the other moods festino 
and banco which thus auspiciously begins — “idem contingit in 
reliquis duobus qui tamcn sunt magis distincti” we are how 
ever condemned to disappointment for by a common error 
excusable enough in this impetuous writer he has confounded sin 
gulais definites with particulars indefinites and thus the ex 
amples which he adduces of these moods are in fact only examples 
of cesare and camestres the same error had also been previ 
ously committed l iii c the whole therefore of valla’s 
doctrine which is exclusively founded on these examples must go 
for nothing for we cannot presume on such a ground that he 
admits more than the four common moods identifying indeed the 
two first by admitting in them of a double conclusion we can

not certainly infer that he ever thought of recognising a par 
ticular — an indefinite predicate in a negative projiosition 

the third and last indication ¦which i can adduce is that from 
the method to science of john sergeant who has in this as 
in his other books too successfully concealed his name under 
the initials “ j s” he was a catholic priest and from g an 
active religious controversialist whilst as a philosopher in his 
idea philosophicb cartesianm a criticism of descartes in his 
solid philosophy a criticism of lockc“ in his metaphysics and in 
the present work he manifests remarkable eloquence ingenuity 
and independence mingled no doubt with many untenable not to 
say ridiculous paradoxes his works however contain genius 
more than enough to have saved them in any other country from 
the total oblivion uito which they have fallen in this — where in 
deed they probably never were appreciated his method to sci 
ence a treatise on logic was published in cg with a “ preface 
dedicatory to the learned students of both our uni vcrsities” ex 
tending to sixtytwo pages but alas neither this nor any other 
of his philosophical books is to be found in the bodleian 

in the third book of his method which treats of discourse 
after speaking of the first or as he calls it only right figure of a 
syllogism” we have the following observations on the second and 
third — “ § wherefore the other two figures he does not recog 
nise the fourth are unnatural and monstrous for since nature 
has shown us that what conjoins two notions ought to be placed 
in the middle between them it is against nature and reason to 
place it either above them both as is done in that they call the 
second figure or tinder them both as is done in that figure they 
call the third 

§ hence no determinate conclusion can follow in either of 
the last figures from the disksal of the parts in the syllogisms 
for since as appears § the extreme which is predicated of 
the middle term in the major has thence a title to be the predi 
cate in the conebtsion because it is above the middle term which 
is the predicate or above the other extreme in the minor it fol 

• sergeant an intelligent antagonut certain ticws he anticipates kant and 
of both these phuoeophera and i have pope has evidently taken from bis bro

lows that if the middle term be twice above or twice bdow the 
other two terms in the premises that reason ceases and so it is 
left indifferent which of the other terms is to be subject or predi 
cate in the conclusion and the indeterminate conclusion follows 
not from the artificial form of the syllogism but merely from the 
vuuerial identity of all the three terms or from this that their 
notions are fomid in the same em wherefore from these pre 
mises in the second figure 

some laudable thing is all virtue 

all courtesy is a virtue 

or from these in the third 

alt virtue is some laudame 

some virtue is cut courtesy 

the conclusion might either be 

therefore aw courtesy is some laudable 

or some laudable thing is all courtesy 

so that to argue on that fashion or to make use of these awk 
ward figures is not to know certainly the end or conclusion wo 
aim at but to shoot our bolt at no determinate mark since no 
determinate conclusion can in that case follow” p 

extremes it is said meet sergeant would abolish the second 
and third figures as petitory and unnatural as merely material 
corruptions of the one formal first i on the contrary regard all 
the figures as equally necessary natural and formal but we 
agree in this both hold that in the second and third figures there 
is a twofold and indifferent conclusion howbeit the one makes 
this a monstrosity of the syllogistic matter the other a beauty of 
the syllogbtic form therefore though i view sergeant as wrong 
in his premises and “ shooting his bolt at no determinate mark” 
i must needs allow that he has by chance hit the bull’s eye i 
have inserted within square brackets the quantifications required 
to restore and show out the formality of his examples on my 
scheme of notation they stand as follows —

ii and iii — alexander and herminus 

alexander in an pry f b 

second figure c v aristotle — “ ‘ the middle extreme is that 
which lies towards the middle’ 

§ “ but it is a question whether in the second figure there 
be by nature any major and minor extreme and if there be by 
what criterion it may be known for if we can indifferently con 
nect with the middle term whichsoever extreme we choose this 
we may always call the major and as negative conclusions only 
are drawn in this figure universal negatives being also mutu 
ally convertible it follows that in universal negatives the one 
term has no better title to be styled major than the other seeing 
that the major term is what is predicated whilst both are here 
indifferently predicable of each other in universal affirmatives 
indeed the predicate is major because it has a wider extent and 
for this reason such propositions are not simply convertible 
so that here there is by nature a major term which is not to be 
found in universal negatives 

“ herminus is of opinion that in the second figure 

° “ if both the extremes of which the middle is predicated 
be homogeneous or of the same genus the major term is that most 
proximate to the genus common to the two for example — 
if the extremes be bird and man bird lying nearer to the com 
mon genus animat than man as in its first division bird is 
thus the major extreme and in general of homogeneous terms 
that holding such a relation to the common genus is the major 

° “but if the tenus be equally distant from the common genus 
as horse and man we ought to regard the middle predicated of 
of them and consider of which term it is predicated through 
that term itself and of which through some other predicate 
and compare that through which it is predicated of another with 
that through which it is predicated of the term itself and if 
that through which the middle is predicated of another viz 
the one extreme be nearer than the other extreme to the 
common genus that extreme of which for tovtow ov i read 
tovtoi ouj the middle is mediately predicated from its closer 
propinquity to the common genus rightly obtains the title of 
major for example if the extremes be horse and man 


 



 


appendix 


rational being predicated of them — negatively of horse aflsrnia 
tively of man seeing that rational is not of itself denied of 
horse but because horse is irrational whereas rational is of 
itself afibrmed of man horse is nearer than man to their common 
genus animal horse will therefore be the major extreme though 
man be no further removed than horse ftom its proper genus 
and this because that through which the predicate te the middle 
is predicated of this last as being irrational is greater for ra 
tional is not denied of horse qua horse whilst it is affirmed of 
man qua man 

° “ but if the extremes be not homogeneous but under diffe 
rent genera that is to be considered the major term which of the 
two holds the nearer of its own genus for instance if aught be 
predicated of colour and man colour is the major extreme for 
colour stands closer to quality than man to substance as man 
is an individual or most special species but not colour 

° “finally if each be equally remote from its proper genus 
we must consider the middle and inquire of which term it is pre 
dicated through that term itself and of which through some 
thing else and if that through which the middle is predicated 
of another ic one extreme be nearer to its proper genus and if 
through that the middle be actually predicated of this term this 
term is to be deemed the major for example if the terms bo 
white and man the one being an individual species in quality the 
other in substance and if rational be affirmatively predicated of 
man negatively of white the affirmation is made in regard 
to man as man whereas the negation is made of white not as 
white but as inanimate but since inanimate through which 
rational is denied of white is more common more universal and 
more proximate to substance inanimate than man to substance 
animate on that account white is the major term in preference to 
man” so far herminus 

“ but to reason thus and to endeavour to demonstrate a major 
term by nature in the second figure is a speculation which may 
be curious but is not true i read irpo tw 

° “for in the first place if we consider the given terms 
not in themselves but in relation to others in which the predi 
cated term does not inhere the major term will be always found 
in the negative proposition for in this case the major is always

for the middle does not inhere where it is not supposed to inhere 
wherefore its repugnant opposite inheres in the subject but the 
repugnant opposite of the middle is equal to the middle and 
this either through the middle itself or through another notion of 
wider extent as when rational is denied of something through 
inanimate for there is here an equallsation through irrational 
through which rational is negatively predicated of horse for 
either the middle is equal to this of which it is denied or i read 
 for o it is less as when through inanimate rational is de 
nied of aught for inanimate is equal to animate under which 
is rational a notion greater than that other of which it is affirmed 
for since the affirmative predicate is greater than its subject of 
which the middle is denied or not affirmed and since the reason 
why the middle is denied is equal to or greater than the middle 
itself which middle again in an affirmative proposition is greater 
than its subject — on these accounts a negative proposition is 
always greater than an affirmative nevertheless aristotle him 
self says that a negation is to be placed in the minor proposi 
tion for the second syllogism in this figure caniestres has as 
its minor premise an universal negative 

° “ further why in the case of negatives alone should explan 
ation or inquiry be competent in regard to the reason of the nega 
tive predication seeing that in the case of affirmatives the reason 
is equally an object of inquiry for rational is predicated of 
man of itself indeed but not primarily that is not inasmuch as 
he is man but iuasmuch as he is rational so that if rational 
be denied of horse through irrational still these are both 
branches of the same divlsion by this method assuredly no 
major can be ever found wherefore we ought not in this way 
to attempt a discrimination of the mqjor of affirmative syllogisms 
in the second figure for in this figure affirmation and negation 
are equally compatible with the major term so that whatsoever 
term has by the forementioned method been found mqjor the same 
taken either as major or minor will effectuate a syllogistic juga 
tion which being competent there is no longer any major or 
minor in this figure for the problem is to find not a mqjor

° “ nor on the other hand as is thought by some is that un 
conditionally to be called the major term which stands predicate 
in the conclusion for neither is this manifest if left indefinite 
preindesignate the same term will hold a dififerent relation 
though a conversion of the universal negative so that what is 
now the major may be anon the minor we may in fact be said to 
constitute the same terra both major and minor naturally there 
is in negative propositions no major notion nor from the conclu 
sion ought we to make out the major at all nor is the case 
different when the term is defined predesignate for the con 
clusion shows as predicate the term given as major in the pre 
mises so that the conclusion is not itself demonstrative of the 
major on the contrary the being taken in the premises as 
major is the cause why a term is also taken as predicate in the 
conclusion 

“ nor however can it be said that in this figure there is no major 
for this at least is determinate — that its major must be universal 
and if there be in it any syllogistic combination that premise is 
the major wliich contains the major tenn 

° “ but in the second figure which of the terms is to be 
deemed the major that is to be deemed the major and to be 
placed first which in the problem question or qumsitum we intend 
to demonstrate and which we regard as predicate for every one 
who reasons first of all determines with himself what it is he 
would prove and to this end he applies his stock of suitable pro 
positions for no one stumbles by chance on a conclusion the 
notion therefore proposed as predicate in the problem to be 
proved is to be constituted the major term for although the pro 
position be converted and the notion thereby become the subject 
still in what we proposed to prove it actually was and there 
fore virtually remains the predicate hence even if there be 
drawn another conclusion we convert it so that to us who prove 
and syllogise and order terms that always stands as the major 
for major and minor are not in negative syllogisms regulated by 
their own nature but by the intention of the reasoner to con 
clude thus it is manifest that what is the predicate in the pro 
blem is also the predicate in the conclusion”

third figure this is the third figure and holds the 
last place because nothing universal is inferred in it and because 
sophistical syuogisms chiefly affect this flgure with their indefinite 
and particular conclusions but the sophistical are the last of all 
syllogisms add to this that while both the second and 

third figures take their origin from the first of the two the 
third is engendered of the inferior premise for the minor qua 
minor is the inferior premise and holds reasonably a secondary 
place the conversion of the minor proposition of the first figure 
giving the third figure

universal affirmatives darapti but it may be asked — why 
whilst in the second figure there are two syllogistic conjugations 
having one of the premises an universal affirmative the other an 
universal negative from having now their major now their 
minor as an universal negative proposition converted — why in 
the third figure there is not in like manner two syllogistic com 
binations of two universal aflsrmatives since of these either the 
major or the minor proposition is convertible is it that in the 
second figure from the propositions being of diverse form quality 
the commutation of a universal negative into something else by 
conversion is necessaiy this being now the major now the minor 
and it not being in our power to convert which we will in the 
third figure on the other hand there being two universal affirma 
tives the position relation of the propositions for they are simi 
lar in character and position is not the cause of one being now 
converted now another the cause lying in us not in the jugation 
wherefore the one or other being similarly convertible inasmuch 
as the position relation of the two propositions is the same the 
one which affords the more important probation is selected and 
hereby is determined the syllogistic jugation moreover the dif 
ferences of syllogism moods in each figure are effected by the 
differences among their jugations not by those among their proba 
tions thus that the combination of propositions is syllogistic or 
valid is proved by conversion and reductio ad impossibile also by 
exposition but from this circumstance there does not emerge a 
plurality of syllogisms moods for the different probations are 
not valid from such plurality but from the unity of the jugation

syllogistic figures in general — “ we must premise what 
is the major proposition of the syllogism and what the minor 
but to understand this we must previously be aware what are 
the major and minor terms and it is possible to define 
these both in common as applicable to all the three figures 
and in special with reference to the first alona in the latter 
relation that is regarding specially the first figure the major 
term is that which constitutes the predicate the minor that 
which constitutes the subject of the middle so far as limited 
to the first figure but since in neither of the other figures do 
the extremes reciprocally stand in any definite relation to the 
middle term it is manifest that this determination is inapplicable 
to them we must therefoie employ a rule common to all the 
three figures to wit that the major term is that predicated the 
minor that subjected in the conclusion thus the major proposi 
tion is the one containing the major term the minor propo 
sition the one containing the minor term examples of the 
first figure — man is animal animal substance therefore 
man substance of the second — animal is predi 

cated of all man animal of no stone man therefore of no 
stone of the third — some stone is white all stone 
is inanimate cansequently some white is inanimate 

first figure — f b aristotle c § ‘“but i call 
that the middle term which itself is in another and another in it 
and which in position lies intermediate’ 

“ this definition of the middle term is not common to the three 
figures but limited to the middle of the first figure only for 
c but if there be a certain difference in species 

between the middle terms of the three figures they have likewise 
something in common to wit that the middle term is found 
twice in the premises throughout the three figures which also in 
position is middle for aristotle wishes in the diagraph iu airg 
rg karaypaxlyg to preserve the order of intermediacy so that 
placing the three terms in a straight line we assign the middle 
place to the middle term 

aristotle c § ‘ but i call the extremes both that which 
is in another and that in wliich another is for if a be predi 
cated of all b and b of all c it is necessary that a should also be

predicated of all c we have previously said what we mean by 
the expression predicated of all’” 

“ it may seem perhaps that this is a perfect definition of the 
extremes and of the middle term but it is not for it behoves 
us to subunderstand in addition the word only and thus the 
definition will rightly run — but i call the extremes both that 
which is in another minor and that in which another is major 
for if a bo predicated by au b and b of all c it is necessary 
that a be predicated of all c 

 this the first syllogistic mood is of two affirmative universals 
collecting an affirmative conclusion for if b inhere in all c c is 
consequently a part of b but b is a part of a a therefore 
also inheres in all c c being a part of b the reasoning will be 
plainer in material examples — as substance is predicated of all 
animal animal of all man and there is inferred swsancc of au 
man and conversely aw man isjanimai all animal substance 
therefore all man substance 

“ but it is manifest how in this figure the terms of the first mood 
barbara ought to be taken the first is the most general and the 
second the subaltern genus whilst the third is a species more spe 
cial than the middle the conclusion ought always to be drawn 
thus if proceeding synthetically we commence by the major term 
and proposition substance begins wherefore it also leads the 
way in the conclusion there is predicated substance of all 
animal here commences animal of all man whilst 

the conclusion again commences with substance — substance of all 
man but if we start from the minor term and proposition as 
from man with this also the conclusion will commence all man 
is ammaz all animal substance all man substance 

“ aristotle takes the terms a b c and from the relation of the 
letters he manifests to us the order of the first figure the major 
terra he calls a because a stands first in order the minor tenn 
c and the middle term b as b in its order follows a and pre 
cedes c 

“ it is plain that the terms may possibly be coadeqnate and 
therefore reciprocating as receptive of science — risible — man 
for all man is risible all risible is receptive of science therefore 
all man is receptive of science”

f b aristotle ch § second figure “ ‘ the major ex 
treme is that which lies nearer to the middle the minor that 
which lies farther from the middle’ 

“ in place of more akin and more proximate to the middle not 
in position but in dignity for since of the terms the middle is 
twice predicated while in the conclusion the major is once pre 
dicated but the minor not even once predicated consequent 
ly that which is once predicated will be the more proximate to 
that which is twice predicated that is to the middle than that 
which is not even once predicated wherefore we shall hear him 
aristotle in the third figure calling the minor the term more 
proximate to the middle on account of their affinity for they are 
both subjects while he calls the major term the more remote 
perhaps also he wishes that in the diagraph rg kataypajff 
the major term should be placed closer to the middle and the 
minor farther off but the major extreme in this figure the two 
premises being universal exists not by nature but by position for the 
first of the extremes which you meet with as a subject in the second 
figme — this is the minor extreme the other is the major so in 
the example — all man an animal no plant animal therejore no 
man plant in like manner if we take the commencement from 
plant this becomes the minor term and man the major as no 
jdant animal all man animal no plant therefore man con 
sequently the major and minor terms exist in these examples only 
by position not by natura if indeed one or other of the proposi 
tions be particular the major and the minor terms are then determin 
ed for we hold that in this figure the universal is the major” 
aristotla — § “ ‘the middle is placed external to not between 
the extremes and first in position’ 

 the middle term passes out of what is properly the middle 
position it is also placed out of or external to the extremes but 
either above these or below but if it be placed above so as to bo 
predicated of both it is called first in position if below so as to 
be subjected it is called second wherefore here as predicate 
of both premises he styles the middle term the first for if it 
be placed above it is first in position and in being apart from the 
extremes it is placed without them”

eelation of figures “ we further remark that the first dis 
coverer of syllogisms and their figures was in his arrangement of 
their propositions determined by some arbitrary circumstance his 
views and selections at least were not foundeil on aught natural and 
necessary § he places to wit that premise after the other 
which contains among its terms the subject of the conclusion pro 
bably in order to introduce into all the figures a common law to 
that law however we do not restrict ourselves either in speech or in 
writing the mathematician who perhaps draws the greatest num 
ber of formal syllogisms with the fewest paralogisms commences 
to take the first figure for example not with the major but with 
the minor proposition because not only in this figure is such pre 
mise always the more obtrusive but also because its subject is the 
proper matter of discomse frequently the premise is only quoted 
or it is absolutely omitted whensoever it is of itself obvious to the 
reader or is easily discoverable from the minor and conclusion 
the conclusion inferred is then in like manner constituted into the 
minor proposition of a new syllogism wherewith a new major is 
connected this natural arrangement of the syllogisms of the first 
figure rests consequently altogether on the principle — that we can 
assert of the subject of an affirmative proposition whatever we 
mag know of its predicate or what may be said of the attribute 
of a thing is valid of the th ing itself and this is what the syl 
logisms of the first figure have peculiar to themselves it is also 
so expressed — what is true of the genus is true also of each of 
its species 

§ “ on the other hand in the second and third figures there 
is no talk of species and genera the second figure denies the 
subjects of each other because they are diverse in their attributes 
and every difference of attribute is here effectual we conse 
quently use this figure principally in the case where two things

ought not to be intercommuted or confounded this becomes 
necessarily impossible so soon os we discover in the thing a some 
thing which does not exist in the thing b we may consequently 
say that syllogisms of the second figure lead ns to distinguish 
things and prevent us from confounding notions and it will be 
also found that in these cases we always use them 

§ “ the third figure affords examples and exceptions and 
in this figure we adduce all exempla in contrariiim the two 
formula are as follows — 

“ there are b which are c fur m is b and c 

“ there are b which are not c for m is b and not c 

“ in this manner we draw syllogisms of the third figure for the 
most part in the form of copulative propositions § because 
we are not wont twice to repeat the subject or to make thereof 
two propositions sometimes one proposition is wholly omitted 
when to wit it is selfmanifest 

“in the fourth figure as in the first species and genera appear 
only with this difference that in the moods baralip dibatis 
fesapo fresison the inference is from the species to the genus 
whereas in calentes there is denied of the species what was denied 
of the genus for where the genus is not neither arc there any 
of its species this last mood we therefore use when we conclude 
negatively a minori ad majus seeing that the genus precedes and 
is more frequently presented than any of its species 

§ “ the syllogisms of the four figures are thus distinguished 
in relation to their employment in the following respects — 

“ the first figure ascribes to the thing what we know of its 
attribute it concludes from the genus to the species 

 the second figure leads to the discrimination of things and 
relieves perplexity in our notions 

“ the third figure affords examples and exceptions in pro 
positions which appear general 

“ the fourth figure finds species in a genus in baralip and 
dibatis it shows that the species does not exhaust the genus in 
fesapo fresison and it denies the species of what was denied 
of the genus in calentes 

§ “ this determination of the difierence of the four figures 
is absolutely speaking only manifested when we employ them 
after natural fashion and without any thought of a selection for 


 


 


appendix 


as the syllogisms of every figure admit of being transmuted into 
those of the first and partly also into those of any other if we rightly 
convert or interchange or turn into propositions of equal value 
their premises consequently in this point of view no difference 
subsists between them but whether we in every case should perform 
such commutations in order to bring a syllogism under a favourite 
figure or to assure ourselves of its correctness — this is a wholly 
difierent question the latter is manifestly futile for in the 
commutation we must always undertake a conversion of the pre 
mises and a converted proposition is assuredly not always of 
equal evidence with that which we had to convert while at the 
same time we are not so well accustomed to it for example the 
proposition some stones attract iron every one will admit be 
cause the magnet is a stone and attracts iron this syllogism is 
in the third figure in the first by conversion of one of its pre 
mises it would run thus — 

major — a it magneu attract iron 

minor — some stones are maijnets 

conclusion — some stones attract iron 

here we are unaccustomed to the minor proposition while it ap 
pears as if we must pass all stones under review in order to pick 
out magnets from among them on the other hand that the 
magnet is a stone is a proposition which far more naturally sug 
gests itself and demands no consideration in like manner a 
circle is not square for the circle is round — the square not this 
proof in the third figure is as follows when cast in the first — 

what is not round is no circle 

a square is not round 

consequently c 

here the major proposition is converted by means of terminus iriji 
nitus and its truth is manifested to us only through the conscious 
ness that all circles are round for independently of this pro 
position should we not hesitate — there being innumerable things 
which are not round — whether the circle were one of those which 
belonged to this category we think not because we are aware 

§ “ it is thus apparent that we use every syllogistic figure 
there where the propositions as each figure requires them are 
more familiar and more current the difference of figures rests 


 



appendix 


 


therefore not only on their form but extenrls itself by relation to 
their employment also to things themselves so that we use each 
figure where its use is more natural the first for finding out or 
proving the attributes of a thing the second for finding out or 
p’oving the difference of things the third for finding out and 
proving examples and exceptions the fourth for finding out 
and excluding the species of a oetius 

§ “ further whether the three last figures are less evident 
than the first is a question which has been denied aflbrmed on 
this account that the first figure only rests immediately on the 
dictum de omni et kullo § whilst the others have hitherto 
by a circuit been etluoed therefrom we have already remarked 
§ that this circuit through our mode of notation is wholly 
superseded we need therefore only translate its principle into 
the vernacular and we shall find that the d ictum de mni et nullo 
is on that account applicable to the first figure because its truth 
is based on the nature of the proposition from this principle 
therefore the first figure and its moods admit of an immediate de 
duction it is thus only a question whether the other figures are 
incapable capable of such immediate deduction or whether it 
is necessary previously to derive them through the first figure 
our mode of notation shows that the latter is an unnecessary cir 
cuit because every variety of syllogism admits for itself a various 
notation and because in that case the premises are taken for what 
they actually are consequently every figure like the first has its 
own probation — a probation drawn exclusively from the natures of 
the propositions the whole matter is reduced to this — whether 
a notion wholly or in part is or wholly or in part is not under 
a second and whether again this second wholly or in part is 
or wholly or in part is not under a third all else proceeds only 
on the interchange of equivalent modes of expression — the figured 
namely and those which are not figured and this interchange 
we may style translating since the figured modes of expression may 
be regarded as a special language serving the purpose of a nota 
tion we have above § after all the syllogistic modes were 
discovered and denoted adduced the dictum de omni et nullo 
but only historically since our manner of determining the syllogis

from which this dictum is only a consequence moreover this

consequence is special resting as it does on the notions of species 
and oenera wherefore its validity only extends so far as pro 
positions can be recalled to these notions as for example in 
the first figure in the second the notion of difference emerges 
and in the third the notion of example if we therefore would 
have special dicta for the several figures in that case it would 
follow and at the same time become manifest that the middle 
term of a syllogism considered for itself expresses in the first 
figure a principle of ascription or procreation in the second 
difference in the third an examjile and in the fourth the 
principle of reciprocity

xiii— fries 

fries system der loyik § — “the species of categorical syl 
logisms are determined by the variety of relations in which three 
notions may stand to each other so that a syllogism may be the 
result 

“ these relations may be thought as three 

 case i — three notations are reciprocally subordinated in gra 
dation so that the second is subordinated to the first but super 
ordinated to the third 

“ case ii — two notions are subordinated to a third 

“case iii — two notions are superordinated to a third® 

“ when in these cases is a syllogism possible 

§ — “ in all the three cases the syllogisms are equally valid 
for they are founded on the general laws of the comiection of 
notions 

 they all follow to wit from the relation of a whole sphere to 
its parts which lies in the dictum de omni et xtdlo the prin 
ciples for the three mentioned cases are thus — 

“for the first — the part c of the part b lies in the whole 
a and what a lies out of the whole b lies also out of the 
 art c 

“ for the second — what a or some a lies out of the whole b 
lies also out of its parts c 

for the third — if a part b lie in two wholes a and c in 
that case these have a part in common and if a part b he in a 
whole c hut out of a nother whole a in that case the first c 
has a part out of the other a 

 the first case alone coincides immediately with the perfect de 
claration of a syllogism — that a case is therein determined by a 
rule for the third case therefore our two declarations of a 
major premise — that it is the rule and that it contains the major 
term — do not coincide seeing that here the minor term may be 
forthcoming in the rule on this account the arrangement of the

first case is said to be the only regular and the others are reduced 
to it that this reduction is easily possible we may in general 
convince ourselves by reflecting that every syllogism requires a 
general rule as premise and that the other cases are only distin 
guished from the first by the converted arrangement of the propo 
sitions but as all propositions may be either purely converted or 
purely counterposed consequently the two last cases can at most 
so far deviate from the first that they are connected with the first 
case only through reversed gegentheilige notions 

§ b “ the doctrine of the several species of categorical syllo 
gisms as regulated by the forms of their judgments is at bottom 
an empty subtlety for the result of all this circuity is only that in 
every categorical syllogism a case is determined by a rule and this 
is already given in the law that in every reasoning one premise 
must be universal tlie scholastic logic treats of this doctrine 
only in so far as the species of syllogism are determined by the 
forms of judgment and thereby only involves itself in long gram 
matical discussions aristotle has been falsely reproached for 
overlooking the fourth figure he only having admitted three for 
aristotle proceeds precisely as i have here done only on the rela 
tion of notions in a syllogism of which there are possible only our 
three cases his error lies in this — that he did not lay a general 
rule at the root of every figure but with a prolixity wholly useless 
in determining the moods of the several figures details each 
even of the illegitimate and demonstrates its illegitimacy this 
prolixity has been too often imitated by other logicians in the 
attempts at an evolution of the moods kant goes too far in de 
nouncing this whole doctrine as a mere grammatical subtlety the 
distinction of the three cases is however a logical distinction and 
his assertion that the force of inference in the other two is wholly 
derived from that of the first case is likewise not correct i mani 
festly however conclude as easily in the third case — ‘a part 
which lies in two wholes is a part common to both’ — as in the 
first — ‘ the part of the part lies in the whole’ the third case 
presents indeed the readiest arrangement for reasonings from the 
particular to the general i e for syllogisms in the second figure

xiv and xv — kbuo and beneke — their doctrines of 
syllogism criticised 

the authority of the two following philosophers who conclude 
this series is rather negative than positive inasmuch as they 
both concur in proving that the last attempts at a reformation of 
the syllogistic theoiy proceed on a wholly different ground from 
that on which i think this alone can be accomplished these two 
philosophers are krug and beneke for beside them i am aware 
of no others by whom this has been attempted 

krug was a disciple of the kantian school kant’s immediate 
successor in hb chair of logic and metaphysics at koenigsberg 
and subsequently professor of philosophy in the university of 
leipsia he is distingubhed not only as a voluminous writer but 
as a perspicuous and acute thinker and hb peculiar modification 
of the kantian system through a virtual return to the principle of 
common sense is known among the german theories by the 
name of synthetism hb logic the first part of hb system of 
theoretical philosophy was published in and is one of the 
best among the many excellent treatises on that science which we 
owe to the learning and ability of the germans i have before me 
the fonrth edition that of krug propounded a new theory 
of syllogistic but the novelty of his scheme is wholly external 
and adds only fresh complication to the old confusion it has 
accordingly found no favour among subsequent logicians 

passing over the perverse ingenuity of the principles on which 
the whole doctrine b founded it is enough to state that krug db 
tributes the syllogbtic moods into eight classes of these the first 
which with some other logicians he considers not as a figure at all 
but as the pure regular and ordinary form of reasoning corre 
sponds to the first figure of the aristotelicoscholastio distribu 
tion the other seven classes as so many impure irregular and 
extraordinary forms constitute on the analogy of rhetoric and 
grammar so many figures of these the new is only the old 
first figure the minor premise in extension being stated before 
the major krug like our other modem logicians b not aware

that this was the order in which the syllogism was regularly cast 
in common language by the greeks by the arabians by the jews 
and by the latins prior to boethius® the old and new first figures 
are only a single figure the syllogism being drawn in the counter 
orders of breadth and of depth a mood in these orders though 
externally varying is intrinsically — is schematically — the same 
krug’s distinction of his new first figure is therefore null thus 
barama is barbara caleme is celarent dirami is darii firemo 
is ferio nor is his discrimination of the other six better founded 
his new the old second and his fith figures are also one 
the latter is precisely the same with the former fimeso is 
festino and fomaco is baroco in one case under camestres 
krug adopts as alone right the conclusion rejected by the logi 
cians in this he and they are in fact both wrong though in 
opposite ways each mood in the second as in the third figure 
has two indifferent conclusions and the special onesided practice 
of the former is only useful as gainsaying the general onesided 
precept of the latter the same objection applies to krug’s new 
the old third in connection with his sixth figure they are 
one duroco is bocardo faphno is felapton and fisemo is 
ferison in two cases under disamis and bocardo krug has 
recognised the repudiated conclusion krug § has how 
ever committed an error in regard to bocardo he gives as its 
example the following syllogism in which for brevity i have 
filled up the quantifications 

“ some animals are not any viviparous 

all animals are some organised tilings 

therefore some organised things are not any viviparous 

in a note he adds “ the conclusion should here be — there 
fore some things tvhich are not viviparous are some organised 
and this is seen also by reduction we have however followed 
the arbitrary precept of the logicians that the extreme in the 
second proposition should stand subject in the conclusion although 
it be here indifferent which extreme becomes the subject the 
conclusion is only changed into another quality” only changed 
into another quality only an affirmative conclusion from a 
negative premise tlie legitimate inference is —

bachmann logik § another eminent logician has erred

indeed one of the last difficulties for reformed logic krug’s new 
the old fourth figure bears a corresponding relation to his 
seventh he is right certainly in abolishing all the moods of the 
fourth figure except fesapo and fresiso and from his point of 
view he is hardly to be blamed for not abolishing these likewise

with them his seventh figure finally rejecting the scholastic

additions kant’s plan of accoroplishing the same end so that 
krug’s conversive and contrapositive and transpositive interpola 
tions by which he brings back to propriety his sevenfold figured 
aberrations are merely the substitution of one false subtlety ” for 
another he and bachmann after him renounce however the 
crotchet of the aristotelians” in making the extreme of the prior 
premise the predicate always of the conclusion in the first and 
second figures and though both do this partially and from an 
erroneous point of view their enunciation such as it is is still 
something 

professor beneke of berlin is the last to whom i can refer 
and in him we have on the point in question the final result of 
modern speculatioa this acute and very original metaphysician 
stands the uncompromising champion of the philosophy of experi 
ence against the counter doctrine of transcendentalism in all its 
forms now prevalent in germany and among the other depart 
ments of mental science he has cultivated the theory of reasoning 
with great ability and success in appeared his lehrbuch 
der logik c in his syllogismorum analyticorum ori 
gines et ordo katuralis c and in his system der logik 
a in two volumes in logic beneke has devoted an especial 
share of attention to the theory and distribution of syllogism but 
it is precisely on this point though always admiring the ingenuity 
of his reasonings that i am compelled overtly to dissent from his 
conclusions 


 


 


appendix 


the syllogistic of beneke is at once opposed and correspondent 
to that of krug there is an external difiference but without imi 
tation an internal similarity instead of erroneously multiplying 
the syllogistic figures like the leipsic philosopher the philosopher 
of berliu ostensibly supersedes them altogether yet when con 
sidered in essence and result both theories agree in being and 
from the same side severally the one an amplification the other 
an express doubling of the nineteen scholastic moods in this 
both logicians were unaware that the same had been long ago 
virtually accomplished in the progress of the science neither con 
sidered that the amplification he proposed was superficial not to 
say mistaken and that instead of simplicity it only tended to 
introduce an additional perplexity into the study beneke has the 
merit of more openly relieving the opposition of breadth and 
depth in the construction of the syllogism and krug though on 
erroneous grounds that of partially renouncing the old error of 
the logicians in regard to the one syllogistic conclusion in the 
second and third figures but in his doctiine of moods beneke 
has i think gone wrong in two opposite ways like krug in his 
arbitrary multiplication of these forms like logicians in general 
in their arbitrary limitation 

in regard to the former — the counter quantities of breadth and 
depth do not discriminate two moods but merely two ways of 
stating the same mood accordingly we do not multiply the 
moods of the first figure to which alone the principle applies by 
casting them in the one dependency and in the other we only 
show that in that figure every single mood may be enounced in a 
twofold order more german the one to the quantity of extension the 
other to the quantity of intension an adequate notation ought 
equally and at once to indicate both but in reference to the 
second and third figures the case is worse for in them we have 
no such dependency at all between the extremes and to double 
their moods on this principle we must take divide and arbitrarily 
appropriate one of the two indifferent conclusions but as every 
single mood of these figures has a double conclusion this division 
cannot be made to difference their plurality k professor beneke 
would look instar omnium into apuleius or isidoms or better 
than cither into blcmmidas he will find all his new moods not

of course those in the fourth figure stated by these as by other 
ancient logicians who however dreamed not that the mere acci 
dental difference of what they called an analytic and synthetic 
enouncement determined any multiplication of the moods them 
selves 

in the latter respect dr beneke has only followed his predeces 
sors i therefore make no comment on the imperfection but in 
accomplishing what he specially proposes whilst we do not find 
any advancement of the science we find the old confusion and 
intricacy replaced by another perhaps worse to say nothing of 
his nonabolition of the fourth figure and of his positive failures 
in doubling its moods the whole process is carried on by a series 
of arbitrary technical operations to supersede which must be the 
aim of any one who would reconcde logic with nature his new

author’s language tliat after considerable study i am still in doubt

denies in conformity with the common doctrine the universal 
quantification of the predicate in afiirmative propositions and yet 
founds four moods upon this very quantification in the conver 
sion of a universal affirmative this is one insolubility but there 
arises another from these moods themselves § for if we 
employ this quantification we have moods certainly but not of the 
same figure with their nominal correlatives whereas if we do not 
simply rejecting the permission all slides smoothly — we have the 
right moods in the right figure this again i am unable to solve 
dr beneke’s duplication of the moods is also in sundry cases only 
nominal as is seen for example in ferio fesapo and fre

latins that of breadth has been the common if not the exclusive 
mode of euouncement among the western logicians since the time 
of boethius in either form there are thus four direct moods

to boethius overlooking entirely the four direct moods in the 
order of depth which they did not employ as the conclusion 
would in these cases have been opposed to their own order they 
seized upon the five indirect moods of the order of depth as this 
aflforded a conclusion corresponding to their own and constituted 
it thus limited into a fourth figure

a direct opposed therefore to the order of predication marked

by relation to each other this cannot however in fact be and 
in reality there is a silently suppressed conclusion from which 
there is only given the converse but the conversion itself ignored 

fourth figure reasons against — 

° could never directly naturally reach a conclusion from pre

° all other figures conversion of premises of first but by 
conversion of conclusion as it is no new figure 

° all other figures have one conclusion fourth a converted 
one often dififerent

show the perversion in this figure by speaking of higher and

 if we ask whether a be in c and say that a is in c because 
a is in b and b in c in this case there is a natural syllogism 
by general confession and this in the first figure 

in like manner if we say that a is not in c because b is in 

c and b is not in a it is plain that we collect that conclusion by 
natural process and this is the second figure which is frequently 
found employed by men in their ordinary discourse 

“ in like manner also if we say that a is in c because a and c 
are in b that syllogism is also natural to us and is the third 
figure but if we say a is in c because c is in b and b in a 
the reasoning is one which no one would naturally make for the 
reason that the qu®situm that is c to be in a does not hence 
follow — the process being that in which we say a is in c since a 
is in b and b in c and this is something which thought would 
not perform unless in opposition to nature from this it is mani 
fest that the fourth figure of which galen makes mention is not 
a syllogism on which thought would naturally light” c there

 blunders of logicians — what have been called the

men are ambitious but the minor proposition although formally 
particular involves however a universal to wit its convcise — all 
the learned aresome men — which is equipollent — whynotthen 
scientifically enounce as i have done without conversion what 
the thought of the convertend already really and vulgarly involved 

in all figures — i have been not undoubtful whether the 
syllogisms of the class in which the two premises being the 
same are mutually interchangeable should be regarded as a single 
or as a double mood abstractly considered from all matter the 
mood is single for the two premises however arranged afford 
only a repetition of the same form but so soon as the form is 
applied to any matter be it even of a symbolical abstraction the 
distinction of a double mood emerges in the possible interchange 
of the now two distinguished premises to the logicians this ques 
tion was only presented in the case of darapti iii ii and on this 
they were divided aristotle an pr i c § contemplates 
only one mood but his successor theophrastus admitted two 
apuleius de uab doctr platonis l iii op p elm aris 
totle’s opinion was overtly preferred by alexander ad locum f 
ed aid quoted above p and by apuleius c whilst that 
of theophrastus was adopted by porphyry in his lost commentary 
on the prior analytics and though not without hesitation by 
boethius de syll categ l ii op pp the 
other greek and eoman logicians silently follow the master from 
whom in more modem times valla to say nothing of others only 
difters to reduce on the counterextreme cesare and camestres 
ii ix a and x b and he might have added dlsamis and datisi 
iii iv v to a single mood de dial l ii c for the ob 
servations of the aphrodisian see above p et seq 

to me it appears on reflection right to allow in darapti only a 
single mood because a second simply arising through a first and 
through a transposition has therefore merely a secondary cor 
relative and dependent existence in this respect all is difier 
ent with cesare and camestres disamis and datisi the prin 
ciple here applies in my doctrine to the whole class of syllogisms 
with balanced middle and extremes

appendix 


 


in canvassing the special rule of the second figure — that the 
major premise should be universal — he now approbates he now 
reprobates syllogisms of this mood but wrong on both alterna 
tives for his admissions and rejections are equally erroneous “ hie 
syllogismus non valet — aliquod animal est aliquodi rationale 
sed uwus asinus non est rationalis ergo umim asinus 

non est aliquod animal p the syllogism is valid only 
it involves a principle which derodon with the logicians would 
not allow — tliat in negatives the predicate could be particular — 
see log rest de argument c ii § p yet almost 
immediately thereafter in assailing the rule he says — “ at multi 
dantur syllogism constantes major particular qui tamen sunt 
recti ut — aliquod animal non est ullus lapis sed omwts 
adamas est oziquts lapis ergo ullus adamas non est aliquod 
animal this syllogism is indeed ii iii a but he goes on 
“item aliquod animal est aliquod rationale sed uwus 
lapis non est rationalis ergo mwms lapis non est oi 

quod animal” now these two syllogisms are both bad as in 
ferring what derodon thinks they do infer — a negative conclusion 
with of course a distributed predicate p are both good 
as inferring what i suppose them to infer — a negative conclusion 
with an undistributed predicate 

fig iii viil b — derodon ibid § in considering the 
special eule of the third figure — that the minor preinise should 
be affirmative — alleges the following syllogism as “ ritious ” — 
 omnis homo est aliquod animal sed ufus homo non est 
ttzius asinus ergo asuius non est aliquod animal” 

p it is a viituous syllogism — with a particular predicate 
and not a universal as one logician imagines in a negative con 
clusion — again omitting his reasoning which is inept he pro 
ceeds — “ hie vero syllogismus non est vitiosus sed rectus — 
onint’s homo est quidam rationalis sed homo non est 

asinus or deus ergo ws asimis or deus non est 
quidam rationalis” this syllogism is indeed correct but not 
as derodon would have it with a distributed predicate in the con 
clusion that his conclusion is only true of the asinus per acci 
dens is shown by the substitution of the term deus this showing 
his illation to be formally absurd 


 



 


appendix 


fig iii il — derodon ibid says — “ denique conclusionem 
in tertia figura debere esse particularem non universalem sta 
tuunt commnniter philosophi unde hie syllogismus non valet 
— ‘ omnis fwmo est quidani rationalis sed omnis homo est 
quoddavi animal ergo omne quoddani animal est oddam 
rationale verum licet conclusio sit universalis syllogismus 
erit bonus modo” c p the syllogism is and must 
remain vitious if the subject and predicate of the conclusion be 
taken universally whilst both are undistributed in the antecedent 
but if taken as they ought to be in the conclusion particularly 
the syllogism is good derodon in his remarks partly overlooks 
partly mistakes the vice 

derodon criticising the special rule of the first figure — that 
the major premise should be universal — says inter alia — “ at 
multi dantur syllogismi primm figune constantes majori particu 
lar qui tamen sunt recti ut — ‘ aliquod animal est aliquod 
rationale sed homo est aliquod animal ergo homo est 
aliquis rationalis item” c c p this syllogism is 
vicious the middle term animal being particular in both its 
quantifications affords no inference

method opposite to lambert’s in all that is peculiar to him i 
have been unable to adopt unable to improve anything 

° indefinite or particular notions can only be represented by 
the relation of two lines and in two ways ° one being greater 
than the other ° one being partially out of relation to the 
other instead of this lambert professes to paint particularity by 
a dotted line i e a line difiterent by an accidental quality not 
by an essential relation but not even to this can he adhere for 
the same notion the same line in different relations is at once 
universal and particular accordingly in lambert’s notation the 
relation of particular notions is represented sometimes by a conti 
nuous sometimes by a dotted line or not represented at all see 
below • 

° the inconsistency is seen at all climax in the case of the 
predicate in aflsrmatives where that term is particular in lam 
bert’s notation it however shows in general as distributed or uni 
versal but in this he has no constancy see but 
the case is even more absurd in negative propositions where the 
predicate is really taken in its whole extent and yet is by the 
dotted line detenninately marked as particular see 

° the relation of negativity or exclusion is professedly re 
presented by lambert in one line beyond or at the side of another 
this requires room and is clumsy but is not positively erroneous 
— it does express exclusion but his affirmative propositions are 
denoted by two unconnected lines one below the other this is 
positively wrong for here the notions are equally out of each 
other as in the lateral collocation but even in this he is incon 
sistent for he as often expresses the relation of negativity by 
lines in the relation of higher and lower see below 

° he attempts to indicate the essential relation of the lines by 
the fortuitous annexation of letters the mystery of which i have 
never fathomed 

° he has no order in the relation of his lines 

the middle term is not always the middle line and there is no 
order between the extremes 

this could not indeed be from his method of notation and ex 
cept it be explained by the affixed letters no one could discover 
in his lines the three compared notions in a syllogism or guess at 
the conclusion iqferred see —

in affirmative but not ultratotal excluded in negative has the 
merit of noticing this relation 

“ lambert but it is needless to proceed what has been 
already said shows that lambert’s scheme of linear notation is in 
its parts a failure being only a corruption of the good and a 
blundering and incongruous jumble of the natural and conven 
tional the only marvel is how so able a mathematician should 
have propounded two such worthless mathematical methods but 
lamberts geometrical is worse even than algebraic notation

notation of the moods of the third figure i p which i 
shall number for the previous references

z notation by maass 

professor maass of halle “ discontented not unreasonably with 
the geometrical notations of lambert ancl euler has himself pro 
posed another compared with which those of his predecessors 
show as absolutely perfect it will be sufficient to despatch this 
scheme with a very few remarks to use it is wholly impossible 
and even the ingenious author himself has stated it towards the 
conclusion of his logic § — in the course of which it is 
not if i recollect aright honoured with a single reference it is 
however curious as the only attempt made to illustrate logic 
not by the relations of geometrical quantities but by the relations 
of geometrical relations — angles 

° it is fundamentally wrong in principle for example 
maass proposes to represent eoinclusive notions notions there 
fore to be thought as the same by the angles of a triangle whieh 
cannot possibly be imaged as united for surely the identity of the 
concepts triangle trilateral and figure with angles equal to two 
right angles is not illumined by awarding each to a separate 
comer of the figure on the contrary coexclusive notions he 
represents by angles in similar triangles and these can easily be 
conceived as supeitjosed the same may be said of coordinates 
but waving the objection that the different angles of a figure as 
necessarily thought out of each other are incapable of typifying 
by their coincidence notions to be thought as eoinclusive — it is 
further evident that the angles of an equilateral triangle cannot 
naturally denote reciprocal or wholly identical notions in contrast 
to others partially identical for every angle of every triangle 
infers — necessitates — contains if you wiu — the whole of every 
other equally as do the several angles of an equilateral triangle 

° but maass is not consistent he gives for instance a tri 
angle fig to illustrate the subordination of one notion to 
another and yet he represents the lower or contained notion by 
an obtuser the higher or containing notion by an acuter angle 

° the scheme is unmanifest — in fact nothing can be less ob 
trusive it illustrates the obscure by the obscure or rather it

understanding through the eye it at best only addresses the eye 
through the understanding diflscult — we only regret that it had 
not been impossible 

° it is clumsy operose complex and superfluous for to re 
present a notion denoted by a single angle it is compelled to give 
the redundance of a whole triangle and three repugnant notions 
demand an apparatus of three several figures and six vacant 
anglea in fact the only manifestation to which this scheme of 
angles can pretend is borrowed from the scheme of figures which 
it proposes to supersede

rality of figures a greek and latin alphabet combinations of let

cesses ambiguities c transeat in pace 

c the authors notation — n o i linear 

the notation previously spoken of“ represents every various 
syllogism in all the accidents of its external form but as the 
number of moods in syllogisms analytic and synthetic intensive 
and extensive unfigured and figured and of this in all the 
figures are the same and as a reasoning essentially identical 
may be carried through the same numerical mood in every genus 
and species of syllogism it seems as we should wish it that 
there must be possible also a notation precisely manifesting the 
modal process in all its essential differences but at the same 
time in its internal identity abstract from every accidental variety 
of external form the anticipation and wish are realised and 
realised with the utmost clearness and simplicity in a notation 
which fulfils and alone fulfils these conditions this notation 
i have long employed and the two following are specimens

herein four common lines are all tlie requisites three horizon 
tal to denote the terms one two — perpendicular or the want 
of it at the commencement of comparison to express the quality 
of affirmation or of negation whilst quantity is marked by the 
relative length of a terminal line within and its indefinite excur 
rence before the limit of comparison this notation can repre 
sent equally total and ultratotal distribution in simple syllogism 
and in sorites it shows at a glance the competence or incortijye 
tence of any conclusion and every one can easily evolve it 



of these the former with its converse includes darii dabi 
tis datisi disamis dimaris c whilst the latter with its con 
verse includes celarent cesare celanes camestres cameles 
c but of these those which are represented by the same dia 
gram are though in different figures formally the same mood 
for in this scheme moods of the thirtysix each has its peculiar 
diagram whereas in all the other geometrical schemes hitherto 
proposed whether by lines angles triangles squares parallelo 
grams or circles the same complex diagram is necessarily 
employed to represent an indefinite plurality of moods these 
schemes thus tend rather to complicate than to explicate — rather 
to darken than to clear up the principle of this notation may 
be realised in various forms 


the problem in general is to manifest by the differences and 
relations of geometrical quantities lines or figures the differences 
and relations of logical forma the comparative excellence of any 
scheme in solution of this problem will be in proportion as it is

° i denote terms or notions by straight lines and as a syllo 
gism is constituted by three related notions it will of course be 
represented by tliree related lines 

° i indiciite the correlation of notions by the ortler and par 
allel coextension of lines the perpendicular order and horizon 
tal extension here adopted is arbitrary 

° lines like notions are only immediately related to those 
with which they stand in proximity hence the intermediate 
line in our diagiam representing the middle term of a syllogism 
is in direct relation with the lines representing the extremes 
whereas the latter arc only in mutual correlation through it 

° the relative quantity of notions is expressed by the com 
parative length of the related lines in so far as a line com 
mences liere on the left before another it is out of relation with 
it — is indenite and unknown where a line terminates under 
relation here towards the right it ceases absolutely to be a line 
beginning and ending in relation indicates a whole notion a 
line beginning before or ending after its correlative indicates the 
part of a notion 

“ the kinds of correlation aflbrmation and negation are 
shown by the connection or nonconnection of the lines here 
from the left the connection here a perpendicular line indi 
cates the identity or coinclusion of the connectetl terms the 
absence of this denotes the opposite the lines in positive or affirma 
tive relation are supposed capable of being slid into each other 

this geometric scheme seems to recommend itself by au the 
virtues of such a representation and thus stands favourably con 
trasted with any other for it is easy — simple — compenilious — 
allsufficient — consistent — manifest — precise — complete 

 ° easy — linear diagrams are more easily and rapidly drawn 
than those of figure and the lines in this scheme require in fact 
no symbols at all to mark the terminal differences far less the 
double letterings found uecessaiy by lambert 

° simple — lines denote the quantity and correlation of 
notions far more simply than do any geometric figures in those 
there is nothing redunilant all is significant 

s compendious — in this respect lines as is evident are fiu 
preferable to figures but lambert’s uuear scheme requires more 
than double the space sufficient for that here proposed

° allsufficient — any scheme by figures and lambert’s 
scheme by lines is in itself unintelligible and depends on tho 
annexation of accidental symbols to enable it to mark out the 
differences and relations of terms lambert likewise endeavours 
to supjly this exigency by another means — by the fortuitous quality 
his dottings of certain linea in our scheme lines simple lines 
and lines alone arc sufficient 

° cjonsistent — lamberts linear scheme is a mere jumble of 
inconsistenciea compared with his those by figures are in this 
respect far preferable but the present linear scheme is at once 
thoroughgoing unambiguous and consistent 

° manifest — in this essential conilition all other geometrical 
illustrations arc lamentably defective in those by figure each 
threefoli diagram typifying an indefinite jdurality of moods re 
quires a painful consideration to extract out of it any pertinent 
elucidation this is in fact only brought to bear by the foreign 
aid of contingent symbols nor can these schemes properly re 
present to the eye the relation of the totototal identity of a plu 
rality of terms the intention requires to be intimated by the ex 
ternal accident of signs lamberts lines sink in general even 
below the figures in this respect but as lines are here applied 
the sole pertinent inference leaps at once to sense and under 
standing 

° precise — ambiguity vagueness vacillation redundancy and 
withal inadequacy prevail in the other schemes in those by 
figure one diagram is sometimes illustrative of as many as a dozen 
moods positive and negative and a single mood may fall to be 
represented by four diagrams and perhaps in six several ways 
lambert’s lines are even worse in our scheme on the contrary 
every mood has a diagram applicable to itself and to itself exclu 
sively whilst every possible variety of its import has a correspond 
ing possible variety of linear chfiterence 

° complete — in this last and allimportant condition every 
seheme hitherto proposed is found to fail a thoroughgoing 
adequate and pliant geometric method ought equally and at once 
to represent the logical moods in the unfigured and figured syllo 
gism in the syllogism synthetic and analytic in extension and 
intension — this too in all their mutual convertibilities and in all 
their individual varieties this our scheme performs but exclu

sively so mucli in general again in particular — of the 
figures circles and triangles are necessarily inept to represent the 
ultratotal inclusion or cocxclusion of terms — in a word all the 
relations of proportion except totality and indefinite partiality 
whilst quadrilateral figures are if not wholly incompetent to this 
operose and clumsy lambert’s linear method is incompetent to 
it in negatives and such inability ought to have opened his eyes 
upon the defects of his whole plan for this was a problem which 
he expressly proposed to accomplish tlie present scheme on the 
other hand simply and easily performs this in aflsrmation and 
negation and with any minuteness of detail

 as upwards and downwards is a procedure arbitrary in the 
diagram the diagram indicates that we can indifierently either 
proceed from the premises rationes to the conclusion ratio 
natum or from the conclusion to the premises the process 
being only in different points of view either synthetic or ana 
lytic an exclusive and onesided view be it remembered has 
given an inadequate name to what are called premises and con 
clusion 

 rationally and historically there is no ground for consti 
tuting that premise into major which is enounced first or that 
premise into minor which is enounced list see after p 
c the moods of what is called the fourth figure and the in 
direct moods of the first figure are thus identified — in the 
diagram accordingly it is shown that as right or left in the order 
of position is only accidental so is first or last in the order of 
expression 

 the diagram truly represents by its various concentric 
triangles the unfigured syllogism as involving the figured and 
of the latter the first figure as involving the two others in 
fact the whole differences of figure and figures are accidental 
moods alone are essential and in any figure and in none these 
are always the same and the same in number 

 depth and breadth subject and predicate are denoted by 
the thick and thin ends of the same propositional line 

 depth and breadth are quantities always coexistent always 
correlative each being always in the inverse ratio of the other — 
this is well shown in the connection and contrast of a line gradu 
ally diminishing or increasing in thickness from end to end 

 but though always coexistent and consequently always 
to some amount potentially inferring each other stiu we cannot 
without the intervention of an actual inference at once jump 
from the one quantity to the other — change pe saltum predicate 
into subject and subject into predicate we must proceed gra

appendix 


 


datim we cannot arbitrarily commute the quantities in passing 
from the qursitum to the premises or in our transition from the 
premises to the conclusion when this is apparently done as in 
the indirect moods of the first figure and in all the moods of the 
fourth the procedure is not oidy unnatural but virtually complex 
and mediate the mediacy being concealed by the concealment of 
the mental inference which really precedes — indicated by the 
line and broken line for the first figure 


 in syllogism figure and the varieties of figure are deter 
mined by the counter relations of subject and predicate subsisting 
between the syllogistic terms — between the middle and extremes 
— all adequately represented 

 figure and the differences of figures all depending upon 
the difl’erence of the mutual contrast of subject and predicate 
between the syllogistic terms consequently if this relation be 
abolished — if these terms be made all subjects or it may be all 
predicates the distinction of figure will be abolished also we 
do not abolish be it noted the syllogism but we recall it to one 
simple form — and this is represented in the diagram for as 
the opposition of subject and predicate of depth and breadth is 
shown in the opposition of the thick and thin ends of the same 
tapering line so where as in the outmost triangle the proposi 
tional lines are of uniform breadth it is hereby shown that all 
such opposition is sublated 

 it is manifest that as we consider the predicate or the 
subject the breadth or the depth as principal will the one pre 
mise of the syllogism or the other be major or minor the major 
premise in the one quantity being minor premise in the other — 
shown out in the diagram 

 but as the first figure is that alone in which there is such 
a difference of relation between the syllogistic terms — between 
the middle and extremes so in it alone is such a distinction between 
the syllogistic propositions realised — by the diagram this is made 
apparent to the eye 


 


 


appendix 


 in the unfigured syllogism and in the second and third 
figures there is no difference between the major and minor terms 
and consequently no distinction more than one arbitrary and 
accidental of major and minor propositions — all conspicuously 
typified 

 all figured syllogisms have a double conclusion but 
in the different figures in a different way — this is well repre 
sented 

 the double conclusions both equally direct in the second 
and third figures are shown in the crossing of two counter and 
corresponding line — the logicians are at fault in allowing indi 
rect conclusions in these two figures — nor is aristotle an excep 
tion see pr an i vil § 

 the direct and indirect conclusions in the first figure 
are distinctly typified by a common and by a broken line the 
broken line is placed immediately under the other and may thus 
indicate that it represents only a reflex of — a consequence through 
the other kar avkacriv reflexim per rejiexionem the 
diagram therefore can show that the indirect moods of the first 
figure as well as all the moods of the fourth ought to be re 
duced to merely mediate inferences — that is to conclusions 
from conclusions of the conjugations or premises of the first 
figure “ 


the following table affords a view in detail of the author’s 
scheme of syllogistic notation and of the valid syllogistic moods 
in figure on his doctrine of a quantified predicate in each figiire 
three only being allowed there are aflfimiative and nega 
tive moods in all moods the table exhibits in detail the 
affirmative moods of each figure and the negative moods of 
the first figure with the appropriate notation

the letters c f each the third letter in its respective alphabet 
denote the extremes the letter m denotes the middle term of the 
syllogism definite quantity all any is indicated by the sign 
 indefinite quantity some by the sign or the hori 
zontal tapering line ¦¦— indicates an affirmative relation 
between the subject and predicate of the proposition nega 
tion is marked by a perpendicular line crossing the horizontal 
 i the negative syllogisms in all the figures are exactly 
double the number of the affirmative for every affirmative 
affords a double negative as each of its premises may be marked 
by a negative in extension the broad end of the line denotes 
the subject the pointed end the predicate in comprehension 
this is reversed the pointed end indicating the subject the 
broad end the predicate by the present scheme of notation 
we are thus able to read a syllogism both in elxtcnsion and in 
comprehension the line beneath the three terms denotes the 
relation of the extremes of the conclusion predesignation of 
the conclusion is marked only when its terms obtain a different 
quantity from what they hold in the premises accordingly 
when not marked the quantification of the premises is held re 
peated in the conclusion in the second and third figures — a 
line is inserted above as well as below the terms of the syllogism 
to express the double conclusion in those figures the symbol 
s— shows that when the premises are converted the syllogism 
remains in the same mood shows that the two moods 

between which it stands are convertible into each other by con 
version of their premises the middle term is said to be balanced 
when it is taken definitely in both premises the extremes are 
balanced when both are taken definitely unbalanced when the 
one is definite and the other is not 

the table here given exhibits the author’s final arrangement 
of the syllogistic moods the moods are either a balanced or 
b u ibalanced in the former class both terms and propositions 
are balanced and it contains two moods — i ii in the latter 
class there are two subdivisions for cither a the terms are 
unbalanced — iii iv or b both the terms and propositions are 
unbalanced — v vi vii viii ix x xi xii
