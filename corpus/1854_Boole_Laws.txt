preface 


the following work is not a republication of a former treatise by the author 
entitled “the mathematical analysis of logic” its earlier portion is indeed 
devoted to the same object and it begins by establishing the same system of 
fundamental laws but its methods are more general and its range of applica 
tions far wider it exhibits the results matured by some years of study and 
reflection of a principle of investigation relating to the intellectual operations 
the previous exposition of which was written within a few weeks after its idea 
had been conceived 

that portion of this work which relates to logic presupposes in its reader a 
knowledge of the most important terms of the science as usually treated and 
of its general object on these points there is no better guide than archbishop 
whately’s “elements of logic” or mr thomson’s “outlines of the laws of 
thought” to the former of these treatises the present revival of attention to 
this class of studies seems in a great measure due some acquaintance with the 
principles of algebra is also requisite but it is not necessary that this application 
should have been carried beyond the solution of simple equations for the study 
of those chapters which relate to the theory of probabilities a somewhat larger 
knowledge of algebra is required and especially of the doctrine of elimination 
and of the solution of equations containing more than one unknown quantity 
preliminary information upon the subjectmatter will be found in the special 
treatises on probabilities in “lardner’s cabinet cyclopaedia” and the “library 
of useful knowledge” the former of these by professor de morgan the latter 
by sir john lubbock and in an interesting series of letters translated from 
the french of m quetelet other references will be given in the work on 
a first perusal the reader may omit at his discretion chapters x xiv and 
xix together with any of the applications which he may deem uninviting or 
irrelevant 

in different parts of the work and especially in the notes to the concluding 
chapter will be found references to various writers ancient and modern chiefly 
designed to illustrate a certain view of the history of philosophy with respect 
to these the author thinks it proper to add that he has in no instance given

a citation which he has not believed upon careful examination to be supported 
either by parallel authorities or by the general tenor of the work from which 
it was taken while he would gladly have avoided the introduction of anything 
which might by possibility be construed into the parade of learning he felt it 
to be due both to his subject and to the truth that the statements in the text 
should be accompanied by the means of verification and if now in bringing 
to its close a labour of the extent of which few persons will be able to judge 
from its apparent fruits he may be permitted to speak for a single moment 
of the feelings with which he has pursued and with which he now lays aside 
his task he would say that he never doubted that it was worthy of his best 
efforts that he felt that whatever of truth it might bring to light was not a 
private or arbitrary thing not dependent as to its essence upon any human 
opinion he was fully aware that learned and able men maintained opinions 
upon the subject of logic directly opposed to the views upon which the entire 
argument and procedure of his work rested while he believed those opinions to 
be erroneous he was conscious that his own views might insensibly be warped 
by an influence of another kind he felt in an especial manner the danger of that 
intellectual bias which long attention to a particular aspect of truth tends to 
produce but he trusts that out of this conflict of opinions the same truth will 
but emerge the more free from any personal admixture that its different parts 
will be seen in their just proportion and that none of them will eventually be 
too highly valued or too lightly regarded because of the prejudices which may 
attach to the mere form of its exposition 

to his valued friend the rev george stephens dickson of lincoln the 
author desires to record his obligations for much kind assistance in the revision 
of this work and for some important suggestions

note 


in prop ii p by the “absolute probabilities” of the events xyz is 
meant simply what the probabilities of those events ought to be in order that 
regarding them as independent and their probabilities as our only data the 
calculated probabilities of the same events under the condition v should be 
pgr the statement of the appended problem of the urn must be modified 
in a similar way the true solution of that problem as actually stated is 
p cp q cq in which c is the arbitrary probability of the condition that 
the ball drawn shall be either white or of marble or both at once see p 
case ii 

accordingly since by the logical reduction the solution of all questions in 
the theory of probabilities is brought to a form in which from the probabil 
ities of simple events s t c under a given condition v it is required to 
determine the probability of some combination a of those events under the 
same condition the principle of the demonstration in prop iv is really the 
following “the probability of such combination a under the condition v must 
be calculated as if the events s t c were independent and possessed of 
such probabilities as would cause the derived probabilities of the said events 
under the same condition v to be such as are assigned to them in the data” 
this principle i regard as axiomatic at the same time it admits of indefinite 
verification as well directly as through the results of the method of which it 
forms the basis i think it right to add that it was in the above form that the 
principle first presented itself to my mind and that it is thus that i have always 
understood it the error in the particular problem referred to having arisen from 
inadvertence in the choice of a material illustration

nature and design of this work 


 the design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of 
those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed to give expression 
to them in the symbolical language of a calculus and upon this foundation to 
establish the science of logic and construct its method to make that method 
itself the basis of a general method for the application of the mathematical 
doctrine of probabilities and finally to collect from the various elements of 
truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable intimations 
concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind 

 that this design is not altogether a novel one it is almost needless to 
remark and it is well known that to its two main practical divisions of logic 
and probabilities a very considerable share of the attention of philosophers has 
been directed in its ancient and scholastic form indeed the subject of logic 
stands almost exclusively associated with the great name of aristotle as it 
was presented to ancient greece in the partly technical partly metaphysical 
disquisitions of the organon such with scarcely any essential change it has 
continued to the present day the stream of original inquiry has rather been di 
rected towards questions of general philosophy which though they have arisen 
among the disputes of the logicians have outgrown their origin and given to 
successive ages of speculation their peculiar bent and character the eras of 
porphyry and proclus of anselm and abelard of ramus and of descartes 
together with the final protests of bacon and locke rise up before the mind 
as examples of the remoter influences of the study upon the course of human 
thought partly in suggesting topics fertile of discussion partly in provoking 
remonstrance against its own undue pretensions the history of the theory 
of probabilities on the other hand has presented far more of that character of 
steady growth which belongs to science in its origin the early genius of pascal 
in its maturer stages of development the most recondite of all the mathematical 
speculations of laplace were directed to its improvement to omit here the 
mention of other names scarcely less distinguished than these as the study of 
logic has been remarkable for the kindred questions of metaphysics to which 
it has given occasion so that of probabilities also has been remarkable for the 
impulse which it has bestowed upon the higher departments of mathematical

science each of these subjects has moreover been justly regarded as having 
relation to a speculative as well as to a practical end to enable us to deduce 
correct inferences from given premises is not the only object of logic nor is it 
the sole claim of the theory of probabilities that it teaches us how to establish 
the business of life assurance on a secure basis and how to condense whatever 
is valuable in the records of innumerable observations in astronomy in physics 
or in that field of social inquiry which is fast assuming a character of great 
importance both these studies have also an interest of another kind derived 
from the light which they shed upon the intellectual powers they instruct us 
concerning the mode in which language and number serve as instrumental aids 
to the processes of reasoning they reveal to us in some degree the connexion 
between different powers of our common intellect they set before us what in 
the two domains of demonstrative and of probable knowledge are the essen 
tial standards of truth and correctness standards not derived from without 
but deeply founded in the constitution of the human faculties these ends of 
speculation yield neither in interest nor in dignity nor yet it may be added in 
importance to the practical objects with the pursuit of which they have been 
historically associated to unfold the secret laws and relations of those high 
faculties of thought by which all beyond the merely perceptive knowledge of the 
world and of ourselves is attained or matured is an object which does not stand 
in need of commendation to a rational mind 

 but although certain parts of the design of this work have been entertained 
by others its general conception its method and to a considerable extent 
its results are believed to be original for this reason i shall offer in the 
present chapter some preparatory statements and explanations in order that 
the real aim of this treatise may be understood and the treatment of its subject 
facilitated 

it is designed in the first place to investigate the fundamental laws of those 
operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed it is unnecessary to 
enter here into any argument to prove that the operations of the mind are in 
a certain real sense subject to laws and that a science of the mind is therefore 
possible if these are questions which admit of doubt that doubt is not to be 
met by an endeavour to settle the point of dispute a priori but by directing 
the attention of the objector to the evidence of actual laws by referring him 
to an actual science and thus the solution of that doubt would belong not to 
the introduction to this treatise but to the treatise itself let the assumption 
be granted that a science of the intellectual powers is possible and let us for a 
moment consider how the knowledge of it is to be obtained 

 like all other sciences that of the intellectual operations must primarily 
rest upon observation the subject of such observation being the very operations 
and processes of which we desire to determine the laws but while the necessity 
of a foundation in experience is thus a condition common to all sciences there 
are some special differences between the modes in which this principle becomes 
available for the determination of general truths when the subject of inquiry is 
the mind and when the subject is external nature to these it is necessary to 
direct attention 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


the general laws of nature are not for the most part immediate objects 
of perception they are either inductive inferences from a large body of facts 
the common truth in which they express or in their origin at least physical 
hypotheses of a causal nature serving to explain phaenomena with undeviating 
precision and to enable us to predict new combinations of them they are in all 
cases and in the strictest sense of the term probable conclusions approaching 
indeed ever and ever nearer to certainty as they receive more and more of the 
confirmation of experience but of the character of probability in the strict and 
proper sense of that term they are never wholly divested on the other hand 
the knowledge of the laws of the mind does not require as its basis any extensive 
collection of observations the general truth is seen in the particular instance 
and it is not confirmed by the repetition of instances we may illustrate this 
position by an obvious example it may be a question whether that formula of 
reasoning which is called the dictum of aristotle de omni et nullo expresses a 
primary law of human reasoning or not but it is no question that it expresses a 
general truth in logic now that truth is made manifest in all its generality by 
reflection upon a single instance of its application and this is both an evidence 
that the particular principle or formula in question is founded upon some general 
law or laws of the mind and an illustration of the doctrine that the perception 
of such general truths is not derived from an induction from many instances but 
is involved in the clear apprehension of a single instance in connexion with this 
truth is seen the not less important one that our knowledge of the laws upon 
which the science of the intellectual powers rests whatever may be its extent or 
its deficiency is not probable knowledge for we not only see in the particular 
example the general truth but we see it also as a certain truth a truth our 
confidence in which will not continue to increase with increasing experience of 
its practical verifications 

 but if the general truths of logic are of such a nature that when presented 
to the mind they at once command assent wherein consists the difficulty of 
constructing the science of logic not it may be answered in collecting the 
materials of knowledge but in discriminating their nature and determining 
their mutual place and relation all sciences consist of general truths but of 
those truths some only are primary and fundamental others are secondary and 
derived the laws of elliptic motion discovered by kepler are general truths 
in astronomy but they are not its fundamental truths and it is so also in 
the purely mathematical sciences an almost boundless diversity of theorems 
which are known and an infinite possibility of others as yet unknown rest 
together upon the foundation of a few simple axioms and yet these are all 
general truths it may be added that they are truths which to an intelligence 
sufficiently refined would shine forth in their own unborrowed light without 
the need of those connecting links of thought those steps of wearisome and 
often painful deduction by which the knowledge of them is actually acquired 
let us define as fundamental those laws and principles from which all other 
general truths of science may be deduced and into which they may all be again 
resolved shall we then err in regarding that as the true science of logic which 
laying down certain elementary laws confirmed by the very testimony of the 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


mind permits us thence to deduce by uniform processes the entire chain of its 
secondary consequences and furnishes for its practical applications methods 
of perfect generality let it be considered whether in any science viewed either 
as a system of truth or as the foundation of a practical art there can properly 
be any other test of the completeness and the fundamental character of its laws 
than the completeness of its system of derived truths and the generality of 
the methods which it serves to establish other questions may indeed present 
themselves convenience prescription individual preference may urge their 
claims and deserve attention but as respects the question of what constitutes 
science in its abstract integrity i apprehend that no other considerations than 
the above are properly of any value 

 it is designed in the next place to give expression in this treatise to the 
fundamental laws of reasoning in the symbolical language of a calculus upon 
this head it will suffice to say that those laws are such as to suggest this mode of 
expression and to give to it a peculiar and exclusive fitness for the ends in view 
there is not only a close analogy between the operations of the mind in general 
reasoning and its operations in the particular science of algebra but there is to 
a considerable extent an exact agreement in the laws by which the two classes of 
operations are conducted of course the laws must in both cases be determined 
independently any formal agreement between them can only be established 
a posteriori by actual comparison to borrow the notation of the science of 
number and then assume that in its new application the laws by which its use is 
governed will remain unchanged would be mere hypothesis there exist indeed 
certain general principles founded in the very nature of language by which the 
use of symbols which are but the elements of scientific language is determined 
to a certain extent these elements are arbitrary their interpretation is purely 
conventional we are permitted to employ them in whatever sense we please but 
this permission is limited by two indispensable conditions first that from the 
sense once conventionally established we never in the same process of reasoning 
depart secondly that the laws by which the process is conducted be founded 
exclusively upon the above fixed sense or meaning of the symbols employed 
in accordance with these principles any agreement which may be established 
between the laws of the symbols of logic and those of algebra can but issue 
in an agreement of processes the two provinces of interpretation remain apart 
and independent each subject to its own laws and conditions 

now the actual investigations of the following pages exhibit logic in its 
practical aspect as a system of processes carried on by the aid of symbols having 
a definite interpretation and subject to laws founded upon that interpretation 
alone but at the same time they exhibit those laws as identical in form with 
the laws of the general symbols of algebra with this single addition viz that 
the symbols of logic are further subject to a special law chap ii to which 
the symbols of quantity as such are not subject upon the nature and the 
evidence of this law it is not purposed here to dwell these questions will be 
fully discussed in a future page but as constituting the essential ground of 
difference between those forms of inference with which logic is conversant and 
those which present themselves in the particular science of number the law in 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


question is deserving of more than a passing notice it may be said that it lies at 
the very foundation of general reasoning that it governs those intellectual acts 
of conception or of imagination which are preliminary to the processes of logical 
deduction and that it gives to the processes themselves much of their actual 
form and expression it may hence be affirmed that this law constitutes the 
germ or seminal principle of which every approximation to a general method 
in logic is the more or less perfect development 

 the principle has already been laid down that the sufficiency and truly 
fundamental character of any assumed system of laws in the science of logic 
must partly be seen in the perfection of the methods to which they conduct 
us it remains then to consider what the requirements of a general method in 
logic are and how far they are fulfilled in the system of the present work 

logic is conversant with two kinds of relations relations among things and 
relations among facts but as facts are expressed by propositions the latter 
species of relation may at least for the purposes of logic be resolved into a 
relation among propositions the assertion that the fact or event a is an invari 
able consequent of the fact or event b may to this extent at least be regarded 
as equivalent to the assertion that the truth of the proposition affirming the oc 
currence of the event b always implies the truth of the proposition affirming the 
occurrence of the event a instead then of saying that logic is conversant with 
relations among things and relations among facts we are permitted to say that 
it is concerned with relations among things and relations among propositions 
of the former kind of relations we have an example in the proposition “all men 
are mortal” of the latter kind in the proposition “if the sun is totally eclipsed 
the stars will become visible” the one expresses a relation between “men” and 
“mortal beings” the other between the elementary propositions “the sun is to 
tally eclipsed” “the stars will become visible” among such relations i suppose 
to be included those which affirm or deny existence with respect to things and 
those which affirm or deny truth with respect to propositions now let those 
things or those propositions among which relation is expressed be termed the 
elements of the propositions by which such relation is expressed proceeding 
from this definition we may then say that the premises of any logical argument 
express given relations among certain elements and that the conclusion must 
express an implied relation among those elements or among a part of them ie 
a relation implied by or inferentially involved in the premises 

 now this being premised the requirements of a general method in logic 
seem to be the following 

lst as the conclusion must express a relation among the whole or among 
a part of the elements involved in the premises it is requisite that we should 
possess the means of eliminating those elements which we desire not to appear 
in the conclusion and of determining the whole amount of relation implied by 
the premises among the elements which we wish to retain those elements 
which do not present themselves in the conclusion are in the language of the 
common logic called middle terms and the species of elimination exemplified 
in treatises on logic consists in deducing from two propositions containing a 
common element or middle term a conclusion connecting the two remaining 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


terms but the problem of elimination as contemplated in this work possesses 
a much wider scope it proposes not merely the elimination of one middle 
term from two propositions but the elimination generally of middle terms from 
propositions without regard to the number of either of them or to the nature 
of their connexion to this object neither the processes of logic nor those of 
algebra in their actual state present any strict parallel in the latter science 
the problem of elimination is known to be limited in the following mannerfrom 
two equations we can eliminate one symbol of quantity from three equations 
two symbols and generally from n equations n — symbols but though this 
condition necessary in algebra seems to prevail in the existing logic also it 
has no essential place in logic as a science there no relation whatever can be 
proved to prevail between the number of terms to be eliminated and the number 
of propositions from which the elimination is to be effected from the equation 
representing a single proposition any number of symbols representing terms 
or elements in logic may be eliminated and from any number of equations 
representing propositions one or any other number of symbols of this kind may 
be eliminated in a similar manner for such elimination there exists one general 
process applicable to all cases this is one of the many remarkable consequences 
of that distinguishing law of the symbols of logic to which attention has been 
already directed 

ndly it should be within the province of a general method in logic to ex 
press the final relation among the elements of the conclusion by any admissible 
kind of proposition or in any selected order of terms among varieties of kind 
we may reckon those which logicians have designated by the terms categorical 
hypothetical disjunctive c to a choice or selection in the order of the terms 
we may refer whatsoever is dependent upon the appearance of particular ele 
ments in the subject or in the predicate in the antecedent or in the consequent 
of that proposition which forms the “conclusion” but waiving the language of 
the schools let us consider what really distinct species of problems may present 
themselves to our notice we have seen that the elements of the final or inferred 
relation may either be things or propositions suppose the former case then 
it might be required to deduce from the premises a definition or description of 
some one thing or class of things constituting an element of the conclusion in 
terms of the other things involved in it or we might form the conception of 
some thing or class of things involving more than one of the elements of the 
conclusion and require its expression in terms of the other elements again 
suppose the elements retained in the conclusion to be propositions we might 
desire to ascertain such points as the following viz whether in virtue of the 
premises any of those propositions taken singly are true or false whether 
particular combinations of them are true or false whether assuming a par 
ticular proposition to be true any consequences will follow and if so what 
consequences with respect to the other propositionswhether any particular 
condition being assumed with reference to certain of the propositions any con 
sequences and what consequences will follow with respect to the others and so 
on i say that these are general questions which it should fall within the scope 
or province of a general method in logic to solve perhaps we might include 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


them all under this one statement of the final problem of practical logic given 
a set of premises expressing relations among certain elements whether things 
or propositions required explicitly the whole relation consequent among any of 
those elements under any proposed conditions and in any proposed form that 
this problem under all its aspects is resolvable will hereafter appear but it is 
not for the sake of noticing this fact that the above inquiry into the nature and 
the functions of a general method in logic has been introduced it is necessary 
that the reader should apprehend what are the specific ends of the investigation 
upon which we are entering as well as the principles which are to guide us to 
the attainment of them 

 possibly it may here be said that the logic of aristotle in its rules 
of syllogism and conversion sets forth the elementary processes of which all 
reasoning consists and that beyond these there is neither scope nor occasion 
for a general method i have no desire to point out the defects of the common 
logic nor do i wish to refer to it any further than is necessary in order to 
place in its true light the nature of the present treatise with this end alone in 
view i would remarklst that syllogism conversion c are not the ultimate 
processes of logic it will be shown in this treatise that they are founded upon 
and are resolvable into ulterior and more simple processes which constitute the 
real elements of method in logic nor is it true in fact that all inference is 
reducible to the particular forms of syllogism and conversion vide chap xv 
ndly if all inference were reducible to these two processes and it has been 
maintained that it is reducible to syllogism alone there would still exist the 
same necessity for a general method for it would still be requisite to determine 
in what order the processes should succeed each other as well as their particular 
nature in order that the desired relation should be obtained by the desired 
relation i mean that full relation which in virtue of the premises connects any 
elements selected out of the premises at will and which moreover expresses that 
relation in any desired form and order if we may judge from the mathematical 
sciences which are the most perfect examples of method known this directive 
function of method constitutes its chief office and distinction the fundamental 
processes of arithmetic for instance are in themselves but the elements of a 
possible science to assign their nature is the first business of its method but 
to arrange their succession is its subsequent and higher function in the more 
complex examples of logical deduction and especially in those which form a 
basis for the solution of difficult questions in the theory of probabilities the aid 
of a directive method such as a calculus alone can supply is indispensable 

 whence it is that the ultimate laws of logic are mathematical in their 
form why they are except in a single point identical with the general laws of 
number and why in that particular point they differare questions upon which 
it might not be very remote from presumption to endeavour to pronounce a 
positive judgment probably they lie beyond the reach of our limited faculties 
it may perhaps be permitted to the mind to attain a knowledge of the laws to 
which it is itself subject without its being also given to it to understand their 
ground and origin or even except in a very limited degree to comprehend their 
fitness for their end as compared with other and conceivable systems of law 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


such knowledge is indeed unnecessary for the ends of science which properly 
concerns itself with what is and seeks not for grounds of preference or reasons 
of appointment these considerations furnish a sufficient answer to all protests 
against the exhibition of logic in the form of a calculus it is not because we 
choose to assign to it such a mode of manifestation but because the ultimate 
laws of thought render that mode possible and prescribe its character and 
forbid as it would seem the perfect manifestation of the science in any other 
form that such a mode demands adoption it is to be remembered that it is the 
business of science not to create laws but to discover them we do not originate 
the constitution of our own minds greatly as it may be in our power to modify 
their character and as the laws of the human intellect do not depend upon our 
will so the forms of the science of which they constitute the basis are in all 
essential regards independent of individual choice 

 beside the general statement of the principles of the above method 
this treatise will exhibit its application to the analysis of a considerable va 
riety of propositions and of trains of propositions constituting the premises 
of demonstrative arguments these examples have been selected from various 
writers they differ greatly in complexity and they embrace a wide range of 
subjects though in this particular respect it may appear to some that too 
great a latitude of choice has been exercised i do not deem it necessary to offer 
any apology upon this account that logic as a science is susceptible of very 
wide applications is admitted but it is equally certain that its ultimate forms 
and processes are mathematical any objection a priori which may therefore 
be supposed to lie against the adoption of such forms and processes in the dis 
cussion of a problem of morals or of general philosophy must be founded upon 
misapprehension or false analogy it is not of the essence of mathematics to be 
conversant with the ideas of number and quantity whether as a general habit 
of mind it would be desirable to apply symbolical processes to moral argument 
is another question possibly as i have elsewhere observed the perfection of 
the method of logic may be chiefly valuable as an evidence of the speculative 
truth of its principles to supersede the employment of common reasoning or 
to subject it to the rigour of technical forms would be the last desire of one 
who knows the value of that intellectual toil and warfare which imparts to the 
mind an athletic vigour and teaches it to contend with difficulties and to rely 
upon itself in emergencies nevertheless cases may arise in which the value of 
a scientific procedure even in those things which fall confessedly under the or 
dinary dominion of the reason may be felt and acknowledged some examples 
of this kind will be found in the present work 

 the general doctrine and method of logic above explained form also 
the basis of a theory and corresponding method of probabilities accordingly 
the development of such a theory and method upon the above principles will 
constitute a distinct object of the present treatise of the nature of this appli 
cation it may be desirable to give here some account more especially as regards 
the character of the solutions to which it leads in connexion with this object

some further detail will be requisite concerning the forms in which the results 
of the logical analysis are presented 

the ground of this necessity of a prior method in logic as the basis of a 
theory of probabilities may be stated in a few words before we can determine 
the mode in which the expected frequency of occurrence of a particular event is 
dependent upon the known frequency of occurrence of any other events we must 
be acquainted with the mutual dependence of the events themselves speaking 
technically we must be able to express the event whose probability is sought 
as a function of the events whose probabilities are given now this explicit 
determination belongs in all instances to the department of logic probability 
however in its mathematical acceptation admits of numerical measurement 
hence the subject of probabilities belongs equally to the science of number and 
to that of logic in recognising the coordinate existence of both these elements 
the present treatise differs from all previous ones and as this difference not 
only affects the question of the possibility of the solution of problems in a large 
number of instances but also introduces new and important elements into the 
solutions obtained i deem it necessary to state here at some length the peculiar 
consequences of the theory developed in the following pages 

 the measure of the probability of an event is usually defined as a fraction 
of which the numerator represents the number of cases favourable to the event 
and the denominator the whole number of cases favourable and unfavourable 
all cases being supposed equally likely to happen that definition is adopted 
in the present work at the same time it is shown that there is another aspect 
of the subject shortly to be referred to which might equally be regarded as 
fundamental and which would actually lead to the same system of methods 
and conclusions it may be added that so far as the received conclusions of 
the theory of probabilities extend and so far as they are consequences of its 
fundamental definitions they do not differ from the results supposed to be 
equally correct in inference of the method of this work 

again although questions in the theory of probabilities present themselves 
under various aspects and may be variously modified by algebraical and other 
conditions there seems to be one general type to which all such questions or 
so much of each of them as truly belongs to the theory of probabilities may 
be referred considered with reference to the data and the qucesitum that type 
may be described as follows — st the data are the probabilities of one or 
more given events each probability being either that of the absolute fulfilment 
of the event to which it relates or the probability of its fulfilment under given 
supposed conditions ndly the qucesitum or object sought is the probability 
of the fulfilment absolutely or conditionally of some other event differing in 
expression from those in the data but more or less involving the same elements 
as concerns the data they are either causally given — as when the probability 
of a particular throw of a die is deduced from a knowledge of the constitution 
of the piece — or they are derived from observation of repeated instances of the 
success or failure of events in the latter case the probability of an event may be 
defined as the limit toward which the ratio of the favourable to the whole number 
of observed cases approaches the uniformity of nature being presupposed as

the observations are indefinitely continued lastly as concerns the nature or 
relation of the events in question an important distinction remains those 
events are either simple or compound by a compound event is meant one of 
which the expression in language or the conception in thought depends upon 
the expression or the conception of other events which in relation to it may be 
regarded as simple events to say “it rains” or to say “it thunders” is to express 
the occurrence of a simple event but to say “it rains and thunders” or to say 
“it either rains or thunders” is to express that of a compound event for the 
expression of that event depends upon the elementary expressions “it rains” 
“it thunders” the criterion of simple events is not therefore any supposed 
simplicity in their nature it is founded solely on the mode of their expression 
in language or conception in thought 

 now one general problem which the existing theory of probabilities 
enables us to solve is the following viz — given the probabilities of any simple 
events required the probability of a given compound event ie of an event 
compounded in a given manner out of the given simple events the problem 
can also be solved when the compound event whose probability is required is 
subjected to given conditions ie to conditions dependent also in a given man 
ner on the given simple events beside this general problem there exist also 
particular problems of which the principle of solution is known various ques 
tions relating to causes and effects can be solved by known methods under the 
particular hypothesis that the causes are mutually exclusive but apparently not 
otherwise beyond this it is not clear that any advance has been made toward 
the solution of what may be regarded as the general problem of the science 
viz given the probabilities of any events simple or compound conditioned 
or unconditioned required the probability of any other event equally arbitrary 
in expression and conception in the statement of this question it is not even 
postulated that the events whose probabilities are given and the one whose 
probability is sought should involve some common elements because it is the 
office of a method to determine whether the data of a problem are sufficient for 
the end in view and to indicate when they are not so wherein the deficiency 
consists 

this problem in the most unrestricted form of its statement is resolvable by 
the method of the present treatise or to speak more precisely its theoretical 
solution is completely given and its practical solution is brought to depend 
only upon processes purely mathematical such as the resolution and analysis 
of equations the order and character of the general solution may be thus 
described 

 in the first place it is always possible by the preliminary method of the 
calculus of logic to express the event whose probability is sought as a logical 
function of the events whose probabilities are given the result is of the following 
character suppose that x represents the event whose probability is sought a 
b c c the events whose probabilities are given those events being either 
simple or compound then the whole relation of the event x to the events a 
b c c is deduced in the form of what mathematicians term a development 
consisting in the most general case of four distinct classes of terms by the 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


first class are expressed those combinations of the events a b c which both 
necessarily accompany and necessarily indicate the occurrence of the event x 
by the second class those combinations which necessarily accompany but do 
not necessarily imply the occurrence of the event x by the third class those 
combinations whose occurrence in connexion with the event x is impossible 
but not otherwise impossible by the fourth class those combinations whose 
occurrence is impossible under any circumstances i shall not dwell upon this 
statement of the result of the logical analysis of the problem further than to 
remark that the elements which it presents are precisely those by which the 
expectation of the event x as dependent upon our knowledge of the events a b 
c is or alone can be affected general reasoning would verify this conclusion 
but general reasoning would not usually avail to disentangle the complicated 
web events and circumstances from which the solution above described must be 
evolved the attainment of this object constitutes the first step towards the 
complete solution of the question i proposed it is to be noted that thus far the 
process of solution is logical i e conducted by symbols of logical significance 
and resulting in an equation interpretable into a proposition let this result be 
termed the final logical equation 

the second step of the process deserves attentive remark from the final 
logical equation to which the previous step has conducted us are deduced 
by inspection a series of algebraic equations implicitly involving the complete 
solution of the problem proposed of the mode in which this transition is 
effected let it suffice to say that there exists a definite relation between the laws 
by which the probabilities of events are expressed as algebraic functions of the 
probabilities of other events upon which they depend and the laws by which 
the logical connexion of the events is itself expressed this relation like the 
other coincidences of formal law which have been referred to is not founded 
upon hypothesis but is made known to us by observation and reflection 
if however its reality were assumed a priori as the basis of the very definition 
of probability strict deduction would thence lead us to the received numerical 
definition as a necessary consequence the theory of probabilities stands as 
it has already been remarked in equally close relation to logic and to 
arithmetic and it is indifferent so far as results are concerned whether we 
regard it as springing out of the latter of these sciences or as founded in the 
mutual relations which connect the two together 

 there are some circumstances interesting perhaps to the mathematician 
attending the general solutions deduced by the above method which it may be 
desirable to notice 

st as the method is independent of the number and the nature of the 
data it continues to be applicable when the latter are insufficient to render 
determinate the value sought when such is the case the final expression of the 
solution will contain terms with arbitrary constant coefficients to such terms 
there will correspond terms in the final logical equation i the interpretation 
of which will inform us what new data are requisite in order to determine the 
values of those constants and thus render the numerical solution complete 
if such data are not to be obtained we can still by giving to the constants

their limiting values and determine the limits within which the probability 
sought must lie independently of all further experience when the event whose 
probability is sought is quite independent of those whose probabilities are given 
the limits thus obtained for its value will be and as it is evident that they 
ought to be and the interpretation of the constants will only lead to a re 
statement of the original problem 

ndly the expression of the final solution will in all cases involve a particular 
element of quantity determinable by the solution of an algebraic equation now 
when that equation is of an elevated degree a difficulty may seem to arise as 
to the selection of the proper root there are indeed cases in which both the 
elements given and the element sought are so obviously restricted by necessary 
conditions that no choice remains but in complex instances the discovery of 
such conditions by unassisted force of reasoning would be hopeless a distinct 
method is requisite for this end — a method which might not appropriately be 
termed the calculus of statistical conditions into the nature of this method 
i shall not here further enter than to say that like the previous method it is 
based upon the employment of the “final logical equation” and that it definitely 
assigns st the conditions which must be fulfilled among the numerical elements 
of the data in order that the problem may be real ie derived from a possible 
experience ndly the numerical limits within which the probability sought 
must have been confined if instead of being determined by theory it had been 
deduced directly by observation from the same system of phaenomena from 
which the data were derived it is clear that these limits will be actual limits of 
the probability sought now on supposing the data subject to the conditions 
above assigned to them it appears in every instance which i have examined that 
there exists one root and only one root of the final algebraic equation which is 
subject to the required limitations every source of ambiguity is thus removed 
it would even seem that new truths relating to the theory of algebraic equations 
are thus incidentally brought to light it is remarkable that the special element 
of quantity to which the previous discussion relates depends only upon the 
data and not at all upon the quassitum of the problem proposed hence the 
solution of each particular problem unties the knot of difficulty for a system of 
problems viz for that system of problems which is marked by the possession of 
common data independently of the nature of their qucesita this circumstance 
is important whenever from a particular system of data it is required to deduce a 
series of connected conclusions and it further gives to the solutions of particular 
problems that character of relationship derived from their dependence upon a 
central and fundamental unity which not unfrequently marks the application 
of general methods 

 but though the above considerations with others of a like nature justify 
the assertion that the method of this treatise for the solution of questions in the 
theory of probabilities is a general method it does not thence follow that we are 
relieved in all cases from the necessity of recourse to hypothetical grounds it has 
been observed that a solution may consist entirely of terms affected by arbitrary 
constant coefficients — may in fact be wholly indefinite the application of 
the method of this work to some of the most important questions within its

range wouldwere the data of experience alone employedpresent results of this 
character to obtain a definite solution it is necessary in such cases to have 
recourse to hypotheses possessing more or less of independent probability but 
incapable of exact verification generally speaking such hypotheses will differ 
from the immediate results of experience in partaking of a logical rather than 
of a numerical character in prescribing the conditions under which phaenomena 
occur rather than assigning the relative frequency of their occurrence this 
circumstance is however unimportant whatever their nature may be the 
hypotheses assumed must thenceforth be regarded as belonging to the actual 
data although tending as is obvious to give to the solution itself somewhat of a 
hypothetical character with this understanding as to the possible sources of the 
data actually employed the method is perfectly general but for the correctness 
of the hypothetical elements introduced it is of course no more responsible than 
for the correctness of the numerical data derived from experience 

in illustration of these remarks we may observe that the theory of the reduc 
tion of astronomical observations rests in part upon hypothetical grounds 
it assumes certain positions as to the nature of error the equal probabilities 
of its occurrence in the form of excess or defect c without which it would 
be impossible to obtain any definite conclusions from a system of conflicting 
observations but granting such positions as the above the residue of the inves 
tigation falls strictly within the province of the theory of probabilities similar 
observations apply to the important problem which proposes to deduce from 
the records of the majorities of a deliberative assembly the mean probability of 
correct judgment in one of its members if the method of this treatise be applied 
to the mere numerical data the solution obtained is of that wholly indefinite 
kind above described and to show in a more eminent degree the insufficiency 
of those data by themselves the interpretation of the arbitrary constants i 
 which appear in the solution merely produces a restatement of the origi 
nal problem admitting however the hypothesis of the independent formation 
of opinion in the individual mind either absolutely as in the speculations of 
laplace and poisson or under limitations imposed by the actual data as will 
be seen in this treatise chap xxi the problem assumes a far more definite 
character it will be manifest that the ulterior value of the theory of prob 
abilities must depend very much upon the correct formation of such mediate 
hypotheses where the purely experimental data are insufficient for definite so 
lution and where that further experience indicated by the interpretation of the 
final logical equation is unattainable upon the other hand an undue readiness 
to form hypotheses in subjects which from their very nature are placed beyond 
human ken must react upon the credit of the theory of probabilities and tend 
to throw doubt in the general mind over its most legitimate conclusions 

 it would perhaps be premature to speculate here upon the question 
whether the methods of abstract science are likely at any future day to render 
service in the investigation of social problems at all commensurate with those 

 the author designs to treat this subject either in a separate work or in a future appendix 
in the present treatise he avoids the use of the integral calculus

which they have rendered in various departments of physical inquiry an at 
tempt to resolve this question upon pure a priori grounds of reasoning would be 
very likely to mislead us for example the consideration of human freeagency 
would seem at first sight to preclude the idea that the movements of the social 
system should ever manifest that character of orderly evolution which we are 
prepared to expect under the reign of a physical necessity yet already do the 
researches of the statist reveal to us facts at variance with such an anticipa 
tion thus the records of crime and pauperism present a degree of regularity 
unknown in regions in which the disturbing influence of human wants and pas 
sions is unfelt on the other hand the distemperature of seasons the eruption 
of volcanoes the spread of blight in the vegetable or of epidemic maladies in 
the animal kingdom things apparently or chiefly the product of natural causes 
refuse to be submitted to regular and apprehensible laws “fickle as the wind” 
is a proverbial expression reflection upon these points teaches us in some de 
gree to correct our earlier judgments we learn that we are not to expect under 
the dominion of necessity an order perceptible to human observation unless 
the play of its producing causes is sufficiently simple nor on the other hand 
to deem that free agency in the individual is inconsistent with regularity in the 
motions of the system of which he forms a component unit human freedom 
stands out as an apparent fact of our consciousness while it is also i conceive 
a highly probable deduction of analogy chap xxii from the nature of that 
portion of the mind whose scientific constitution we are able to investigate 
but whether accepted as a fact reposing on consciousness or as a conclusion 
sanctioned by the reason it must be so interpreted as not to conflict with an 
established result of observation viz that phsenomena in the production of 
which large masses of men are concerned do actually exhibit a very remarkable 
degree of regularity enabling us to collect in each succeeding age the elements 
upon which the estimate of its state and progress so far as manifested in out 
ward results must depend there is thus no sound objection a priori against 
the possibility of that species of data which is requisite for the experimental 
foundation of a science of social statistics again whatever other object this 
treatise may accomplish it is presumed that it will leave no doubt as to the 
existence of a system of abstract principles and of methods founded upon those 
principles by which any collective body of social data may be made to yield 
in an explicit form whatever information they implicitly involve there may 
where the data are exceedingly complex be very great difficulty in obtaining 
this information — difficulty due not to any imperfection of the theory but to 
the laborious character of the analytical processes to which it points it is quite 
conceivable that in many instances that difficulty may be such as only united 
effort could overcome but that we possess theoretically in all cases and prac 
tically so far as the requisite labour of calculation may be supplied the means 
of evolving from statistical records the seeds of general truths which lie buried 
amid the mass of figures is a position which may i conceive with perfect safety 
be affirmed 

 but beyond these general positions i do not venture to speak in terms of 
assurance whether the results which might be expected from the application

of scientific methods to statistical records over and above those the discovery of 
which requires no such aid would so far compensate for the labour involved as 
to render it worth while to institute such investigations upon a proper scale of 
magnitude is a point which could perhaps only be determined by experience 
it is to be desired and it might without great presumption be expected that in 
this as in other instances the abstract doctrines of science should minister to 
more than intellectual gratification nor viewing the apparent order in which 
the sciences have been evolved and have successively contributed their aid to 
the service of mankind does it seem very improbable that a day may arrive in 
which similar aid may accrue from departments of the field of knowledge yet 
more intimately allied with the elements of human welfare let the speculations 
of this treatise however rest at present simply upon their claim to be regarded 
as true 

 i design in the last place to endeavour to educe from the scientific 
results of the previous inquiries some general intimations respecting the nature 
and constitution of the human mind into the grounds of the possibility of this 
species of inference it is not necessary to enter here one or two general ob 
servations may serve to indicate the track which i shall endeavour to follow it 
cannot but be admitted that our views of the science of logic must materially 
influence perhaps mainly determine our opinions upon the nature of the intel 
lectual faculties for example the question whether reasoning consists merely 
in the application of certain first or necessary truths with which the mind has 
been originally imprinted or whether the mind is itself a seat of law whose 
operation is as manifest and as conclusive in the particular as in the general 
formula or whether as some not undistinguished writers seem to maintain all 
reasoning is of particulars this question i say is one which not merely affects 
the science of logic but also concerns the formation of just views of the consti 
tution of the intellectual faculties again if it is concluded that the mind is by 
original constitution a seat of law the question of the nature of its subjection 
to this law — whether for instance it is an obedience founded upon necessity 
like that which sustains the revolutions of the heavens and preserves the order 
of nature — or whether it is a subjection of some quite distinct kind is also a 
matter of deep speculative interest further if the mind is truly determined 
to be a subject of law and if its laws also are truly assigned the question of 
their probable or necessary influence upon the course of human thought in dif 
ferent ages is one invested with great importance and well deserving a patient 
investigation as matter both of philosophy and of history these and other 
questions i propose however imperfectly to discuss in the concluding portion 
of the present work they belong perhaps to the domain of probable or con 
jectural rather than to that of positive knowledge but it may happen that 
where there is not sufficient warrant for the certainties of science there may 
be grounds of analogy adequate for the suggestion of highly probable opinions 
it has seemed to me better that this discussion should be entirely reserved for 
the sequel of the main business of this treatise — which is the investigation of 
scientific truths and laws experience sufficiently instructs us that the proper 
order of advancement in all inquiries after truth is to proceed from the known 



chapter i nature and design of this work 


 


to the unknown there are parts even of the philosophy and constitution of the 
human mind which have been placed fully within the reach of our investigation 
to make a due acquaintance with those portions of our nature the basis of all 
endeavours to penetrate amid the shadows and uncertainties of that conjectural 
realm which lies beyond and above them is the course most accordant with the 
limitations of our present condition 



chapter ii 

of signs in general and of the signs 
appropriate to the science of logic in 
particular also of the laws to which 
that class of signs are subject 


 that language is an instrument of human reason and not merely a medium 
for the expression of thought is a truth generally admitted it is proposed in 
this chapter to inquire what it is that renders language thus subservient to 
the most important of our intellectual faculties in the various steps of this 
inquiry we shall be led to consider the constitution of language considered as 
a system adapted to an end or purpose to investigate its elements to seek to 
determine their mutual relation and dependence and to inquire in what manner 
they contribute to the attainment of the end to which as coordinate parts of 
a system they have respect 

in proceeding to these inquiries it will not be necessary to enter into the 
discussion of that famous question of the schools whether language is to be 
regarded as an essential instrument of reasoning or whether on the other hand 
it is possible for us to reason without its aid i suppose this question to be beside 
the design of the present treatise for the following reason viz that it is the 
business of science to investigate laws and that whether we regard signs as 
the representatives of things and of their relations or as the representatives 
of the conceptions and operations of the human intellect in studying the laws 
of signs we are in effect studying the manifested laws of reasoning if there 
exists a difference between the two inquiries it is one which does not affect the 
scientific expressions of formal law which are the object of investigation in the 
present stage of this work but relates only to the mode in which those results 
are presented to the mental regard for though in investigating the laws of 
signs a posteriori the immediate subject of examination is language with the 
rules which govern its use while in making the internal processes of thought 
the direct object of inquiry we appeal in a more immediate way to our personal 
consciousness — it will be found that in both cases the results obtained are 
formally equivalent nor could we easily conceive that the unnumbered tongues 
and dialects of the earth should have preserved through a long succession of ages 
so much that is common and universal were we not assured of the existence of 


 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


some deep foundation of their agreement in the laws of the mind itself 

 the elements of which all language consists are signs or symbols words 
are signs sometimes they are said to represent things sometimes the opera 
tions by which the mind combines together the simple notions of things into 
complex conceptions sometimes they express the relations of action passion 
or mere quality which we perceive to exist among the objects of our experi 
ence sometimes the emotions of the perceiving mind but words although in 
this and in other ways they fulfil the office of signs or representative symbols 
are not the only signs which we are capable of employing arbitrary marks 
which speak only to the eye and arbitrary sounds or actions which address 
themselves to some other sense are equally of the nature of signs provided 
that their representative office is defined and understood in the mathematical 
sciences letters and the symbols — c are used as signs although the 
term “sign” is applied to the latter class of symbols which represent operations 
or relations rather than to the former which represent the elements of number 
and quantity as the real import of a sign does not in any way depend upon its 
particular form or expression so neither do the laws which determine its use 
in the present treatise however it is with written signs that we have to do and 
it is with reference to these exclusively that the term “sign” will be employed 
the essential properties of signs are enumerated in the following definition 

definition a sign is an arbitrary mark having a fixed interpretation and 
susceptible of combination with other signs in subjection to fixed laws dependent 
upon their mutual interpretation 

 let us consider the particulars involved in the above definition separately 

 in the first place a sign is an arbitrary mark it is clearly indifferent 

what particular word or token we associate with a given idea provided that 
the association once made is permanent the romans expressed by the word 
“civitas” what we designate by the word “state” but both they and we might 
equally well have employed any other word to represent the same conception 
nothing indeed in the nature of language would prevent us from using a mere 
letter in the same sense were this done the laws according to which that letter 
would require to be used would be essentially the same with the laws which 
govern the use of “civitas” in the latin and of “state” in the english language 
so far at least as the use of those words is regulated by any general principles 
common to all languages alike 

 in the second place it is necessary that each sign should possess within 
the limits of the same discourse or process of reasoning a fixed interpretation 
the necessity of this condition is obvious and seems to be founded in the very 
nature of the subject there exists however a dispute as to the precise nature 
of the representative office of words or symbols used as names in the processes of 
reasoning by some it is maintained that they represent the conceptions of the 
mind alone by others that they represent things the question is not of great 
importance here as its decision cannot affect the laws according to which signs 
are employed i apprehend however that the general answer to this and such 
like questions is that in the processes of reasoning signs stand in the place and 
fulfil the office of the conceptions and operations of the mind but that as those 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


conceptions and operations represent things and the connexions and relations of 
things so signs represent things with their connexions and relations and lastly 
that as signs stand in the place of the conceptions and operations of the mind 
they are subject to the laws of those conceptions and operations this view will 
be more fully elucidated in the next chapter but it here serves to explain the 
third of those particulars involved in the definition of a sign viz its subjection 
to fixed laws of combination depending upon the nature of its interpretation 

 the analysis and classification of those signs by which the operations of 
reasoning are conducted will be considered in the following proposition 

proposition i 

all the operations of language as an instrument of reasoning may he con 
ducted by a system of signs composed of the following elements viz 

st literal symbols as x y c representing things as subjects of our 
conceptions 

nd signs of operation as — x standing for those operations of the 
mind by which the conceptions of things are combined or resolved so as to form 
new conceptions involving the same elements 

rd the sign of identity 

and these symbols of logic are in their use subject to definite laws partly 
agreeing with and partly differing from the laws of the corresponding symbols in 
the science of algebra 

let it be assumed as a criterion of the true elements of rational discourse 
that they should be susceptible of combination in the simplest forms and by 
the simplest laws and thus combining should generate all other known and 
conceivable forms of language and adopting this principle let the following 
classification be considered 


class i 

 appellative or descriptive signs expressing either the name of a thing or 
some quality or circumstance belonging to it 

to this class we may obviously refer the substantive proper or common and 
the adjective these may indeed be regarded as differing only in this respect 
that the former expresses the substantive existence of the individual thing or 
things to which it refers the latter implies that existence if we attach to the 
adjective the universally understood subject “being” or “thing” it becomes 
virtually a substantive and may for all the essential purposes of reasoning be 
replaced by the substantive whether or not in every particular of the mental 
regard it is the same thing to say “water is a fluid thing” as to say “water is 
fluid” it is at least equivalent in the expression of the processes of reasoning 

it is clear also that to the above class we must refer any sign which may 
conventionally be used to express some circumstance or relation the detailed 
exposition of which would involve the use of many signs the epithets of poetic 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


diction are very frequently of this kind they are usually compounded adjec 
tives singly fulfilling the office of a manyworded description homer’s “deep 
eddying ocean” embodies a virtual description in the single word paduoivric 
and conventionally any other description addressed either to the imagination 
or to the intellect might equally be represented by a single sign the use of 
which would in all essential points be subject to the same laws as the use of the 
adjective “good” or “great” combined with the subject “thing” such a sign 
would virtually become a substantive and by a single substantive the combined 
meaning both of thing and quality might be expressed 

 now as it has been defined that a sign is an arbitrary mark it is permis 
sible to replace all signs of the species above described by letters let us then 
agree to represent the class of individuals to which a particular name or descrip 
tion is applicable by a single letter as x if the name is “men” for instance 
let x represent “all men” or the class “men” by a class is usually meant a 
collection of individuals to each of which a particular name or description may 
be applied but in this work the meaning of the term will be extended so as 
to include the case in which but a single individual exists answering to the re 
quired name or description as well as the cases denoted by the terms “nothing” 
and “universe” which as “classes” should be understood to comprise respec 
tively “no beings” “all beings” again if an adjective as “good” is employed 
as a term of description let us represent by a letter as y all things to which 
the description “good” is applicable ie “all good things” or the class “good 
things” let it further be agreed that by the combination xy shall be repre 
sented that class of things to which the names or descriptions represented by x 
and y are simultaneously applicable thus if x alone stands for “white things” 
and y for “sheep” let xy stand for “white sheep” and in like manner if stand 
for “horned things” and x and y retain their previous interpretations let zxy 
represent “horned white sheep” ie that collection of things to which the name 
“sheep” and the descriptions “white” and “horned” are together applicable 

let us now consider the laws to which the symbols x y c used in the 
above sense are subject 

 first it is evident that according to the above combinations the order in 
which two symbols are written is indifferent the expressions xy and yx equally 
represent that class of things to the several members of which the names or 
descriptions x and y are together applicable hence we have 

xy yx 

in the case of x representing white things and y sheep either of the mem 
bers of this equation will represent the class of “white sheep” there may be a 
difference as to the order in which the conception is formed but there is none 
as to the individual things which are comprehended under it in like manner 
if x represent “estuaries” and y “rivers” the expressions xy and yx will indif 
ferently represent “rivers that are estuaries” or “estuaries that are rivers” the 
combination in this case being in ordinary language that of two substantives 
instead of that of a substantive and an adjective as in the previous instance 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


let there be a third symbol as z representing that class of things to which the 
term “navigable” is applicable and any one of the following expressions 

zxy zyx xyz c 

will represent the class of “navigable rivers that are estuaries” 

if one of the descriptive terms should have some implied reference to another 
it is only necessary to include that reference expressly in its stated meaning in 
order to render the above remarks still applicable thus if x represent “wise” 
and y “counsellor” we shall have to define whether x implies wisdom in the 
absolute sense or only the wisdom of counsel with such definition the law 
xy yx continues to be valid 

we are permitted therefore to employ the symbols x y z c in the place 
of the substantives adjectives and descriptive phrases subject to the rule of in 
terpretation that any expression in which several of these symbols are written 
together shall represent all the objects or individuals to which their several mean 
ings are together applicable and to the law that the order in which the symbols 
succeed each other is indifferent 

as the rule of interpretation has been sufficiently exemplified i shall deem it 
unnecessary always to express the subject “things” in defining the interpretation 
of a symbol used for an adjective when i say let x represent “good” it will 
be understood that x only represents “good” when a subject for that quality 
is supplied by another symbol and that used alone its interpretation will be 
“good things” 

 concerning the law above determined the following observations which 
will also be more or less appropriate to certain other laws to be deduced here 
after may be added 

first i would remark that this law is a law of thought and not properly 
speaking a law of things difference in the order of the qualities or attributes 
of an object apart from all questions of causation is a difference in conception 
merely the law expresses as a general truth that the same thing may be 
conceived in different ways and states the nature of that difference and it does 
no more than this 

secondly as a law of thought it is actually developed in a law of language 
the product and the instrument of thought though the tendency of prose 
writing is toward uniformity yet even there the order of sequence of adjectives 
absolute in their meaning and applied to the same subject is indifferent but 
poetic diction borrows much of its rich diversity from the extension of the same 
lawful freedom to the substantive also the language of milton is peculiarly 
distinguished by this species of variety not only does the substantive often 
precede the adjectives by which it is qualified but it is frequently placed in 
their midst in the first few lines of the invocation to light we meet with such 
examples as the following 

“ offspring of heaven firstbom” 

“the rising world of waters dark and deep” 

“bright effluence of bright essence increate” 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


now these inverted forms are not simply the fruits of a poetic license they 
are the natural expressions of a freedom sanctioned by the intimate laws of 
thought but for reasons of convenience not exercised in the ordinary use of 
language 

thirdly the law expressed by may be characterized by saying that the 
literal symbols x y z are commutative like the symbols of algebra in saying 
this it is not affirmed that the process of multiplication in algebra of which 
the fundamental law is expressed by the equation 

xy yx 

possesses in itself any analogy with that process of logical combination which 
xy has been made to represent above but only that if the arithmetical and the 
logical process are expressed in the same manner their symbolical expressions 
will be subject to the same formal law the evidence of that subjection is in 
the two cases quite distinct 

 as the combination of two literal symbols in the form xy expresses the 
whole of that class of objects to which the names or qualities represented by x 
and y are together applicable it follows that if the two symbols have exactly 
the same signification their combination expresses no more than either of the 
symbols taken alone would do in such case we should therefore have 


xy x 

as y is however supposed to have the same meaning as x we may replace it 
in the above equation by x and we thus get 


xx x 

now in common algebra the combination xx is more briefly represented by x 
let us adopt the same principle of notation here for the mode of expressing a 
particular succession of mental operations is a thing in itself quite as arbitrary 
as the mode of expressing a single idea or operation ii in accordance with 
this notation then the above equation assumes the form 

x x 

and is in fact the expression of a second general law of those symbols by which 
names qualities or descriptions are symbolically represented 

the reader must bear in mind that although the symbols x and y in the ex 
amples previously formed received significations distinct from each other noth 
ing prevents us from attributing to them precisely the same signification it is 
evident that the more nearly their actual significations approach to each other 
the more nearly does the class of things denoted by the combination xy ap 
proach to identity with the class denoted by x as well as with that denoted 
by y the case supposed in the demonstration of the equation is that of 
absolute identity of meaning the law which it expresses is practically exem 
plified in language to say “good good” in relation to any subject though 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


a cumbrous and useless pleonasm is the same as to say “good” thus “good 
good” men is equivalent to “good” men such repetitions of words are indeed 
sometimes employed to heighten a quality or strengthen an affirmation but this 
effect is merely secondary and conventional it is not founded in the intrinsic 
relations of language and thought most of the operations which we observe in 
nature or perform ourselves are of such a kind that their effect is augmented 
by repetition and this circumstance prepares us to expect the same thing in 
language and even to use repetition when we design to speak with emphasis 
but neither in strict reasoning nor in exact discourse is there any just ground 
for such a practice 

 we pass now to the consideration of another class of the signs of speech 
and of the laws connected with their use 

class ii 

 signs of those mental operations whereby we collect parts into a whole 
or separate a whole into its parts 

we are not only capable of entertaining the conceptions of objects as char 
acterized by names qualities or circumstances applicable to each individual of 
the group under consideration but also of forming the aggregate conception of a 
group of objects consisting of partial groups each of which is separately named 
or described for this purpose we use the conjunctions “and” “or” c “trees 
and minerals” “barren mountains or fertile vales” are examples of this kind 
in strictness the words “and” “or” interposed between the terms descriptive 
of two or more classes of objects imply that those classes are quite distinct so 
that no member of one is found in another in this and in all other respects 
the words “and” “or” are analogous with the sign in algebra and their laws 
are identical thus the expression “men and women” is conventional meanings 
set aside equivalent with the expression “women and men” let x represent 
“men” y “women” and let stand for “ and ” and “or” then we have 

x y y x 

an equation which would equally hold true if x and y represented numbers and 
 were the sign of arithmetical addition 

let the symbol z stand for the adjective “european” then since it is in 
effect the same thing to say “european men and women” as to say “european 
men and european women” we have 

z x y zx zy 

and this equation also would be equally true were x y and z symbols of number 
and were the juxtaposition of two literal symbols to represent their algebraic 
product just as in the logical signification previously given it represents the 
class of objects to which both the epithets conjoined belong 

the above are the laws which govern the use of the sign here used to 
denote the positive operation of aggregating parts into a whole but the very 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


idea of an operation effecting some positive change seems to suggest to us the 
idea of an opposite or negative operation having the effect of undoing what 
the former one has done thus we cannot conceive it possible to collect parts 
into a whole and not conceive it also possible to separate a part from a whole 
this operation we express in common language by the sign except as “all men 
except asiatics” “all states except those which are monarchical” here it is 
implied that the things excepted form a part of the things from which they are 
excepted as we have expressed the operation of aggregation by the sign so 
we may express the negative operation above described by — minus thus if x be 
taken to represent men and y asiatics i e asiatic men then the conception 
of “all men except asiatics” will be expressed by x — y and if we represent 
by x “states” and by y the descriptive property “having a monarchical form” 
then the conception of “all states except those which are monarchical” will be 
expressed by x — xy 

as it is indifferent for all the essential purposes of reasoning whether we 
express excepted cases first or last in the order of speech it is also indifferent in 
what order we write any series of terms some of which are affected by the sign 
— thus we have as in the common algebra 

xy y x 

still representing by x the class “men” and by y “asiatics” let z represent the 
adjective “white” now to apply the adjective “white” to the collection of men 
expressed by the phrase “men except asiatics” is the same as to say “white 
men except white asiatics” hence we have 

z x — y zx — zy 

this is also in accordance with the laws of ordinary algebra 

the equations and may be considered as exemplification of a single 
general law which may be stated by saying that the literal symbols x y z c 
are distributive in their operation the general fact which that law expresses is 
this viz — if any quality or circumstance is ascribed to all the members of a 
group formed either by aggregation or exclusion of partial groups the resulting 
conception is the same as if the quality or circumstance were first ascribed to 
each member of the partial groups and the aggregation or exclusion effected 
afterwards that which is ascribed to the members of the whole is ascribed to 
the members of all its parts howsoever those parts are connected together 

class iii 

 signs by which relation is expressed and by which we form propositions 

though all verbs may with propriety be referred to this class it is sufficient 
for the purposes of logic to consider it as including only the substantive verb 
is or are since every other verb may be resolved into this element and one of 
the signs included under class i for as those signs are used to express quality 
or circumstance of every kind they may be employed to express the active or 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


passive relation of the subject of the verb considered with reference either to 
past to present or to future time thus the proposition “caesar conquered 
the gauls” may be resolved into “caesar is he who conquered the gauls” the 
ground of this analysis i conceive to be the following — unless we understand 
what is meant by having conquered the gauls ie by the expression “one 
who conquered the gauls” we cannot understand the sentence in question it 
is therefore truly an element of that sentence another element is “caesar” 
and there is yet another required the copula is to show the connexion of these 
two i do not however affirm that there is no other mode than the above of 
contemplating the relation expressed by the proposition “caesar conquered the 
gauls” but only that the analysis here given is a correct one for the particular 
point of view which has been taken and that it suffices for the purposes of 
logical deduction it may be remarked that the passive and future participles of 
the greek language imply the existence of the principle which has been asserted 
viz that the sign is or are may be regarded as an element of every personal 
verb 

 the above sign is or are may be expressed by the symbol the laws 
or as would usually be said the axioms which the symbol introduces are next 
to be considered 

let us take the proposition “the stars are the suns and the planets” and 
let us represent stars by x suns by y and planets by z we have then 

x y z 

now if it be true that the stars are the suns and the planets it will follow that 
the stars except the planets are suns this would give the equation 

x — z y 

which must therefore be a deduction from thus a term z has been removed 
from one side of an equation to the other by changing its sign this is in 
accordance with the algebraic rule of transposition 

but instead of dwelling upon particular cases we may at once affirm the 
general axioms — 

st if equal things are added to equal things the wholes are equal 

nd if equal things are taken from equal things the remainders are equal 

and it hence appears that we may add or subtract equations and employ 
the rule of transposition above given just as in common algebra 

again if two classes of things x and y be identical that is if all the 
members of the one are members of the other then those members of the one 
class which possess a given property z will be identical with those members of 
the other which possess the same property z hence if we have the equation 

x y 

then whatever class or property may represent we have also 


zx zy 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


this is formally the same as the algebraic law — if both members of an equation 
are multiplied by the same quantity the products are equal 

in like manner it may be shown that if the corresponding members of two 
equations are multiplied together the resulting equation is true 

 here however the analogy of the present system with that of algebra 
as commonly stated appears to stop suppose it true that those members of a 
class x which possess a certain property z are identical with those members of a 
class y which possess the same property z it does not follow that the members 
of the class x universally are identical with the members of the class y hence 
it cannot be inferred from the equation 

zx zy 


that the equation 

x y 

is also true in other words the axiom of algebraists that both sides of an 
equation may be divided by the same quantity has no formal equivalent here 
i say no formal equivalent because in accordance with the general spirit of 
these inquiries it is not even sought to determine whether the mental operation 
which is represented by removing a logical symbol z from a combination zx 
is in itself analogous with the operation of division in arithmetic that mental 
operation is indeed identical with what is commonly termed abstraction and it 
will hereafter appear that its laws are dependent upon the laws already deduced 
in this chapter what has now been shown is that there does not exist among 
those laws anything analogous in form with a commonly received axiom of 
algebra 

but a little consideration will show that even in common algebra that axiom 
does not possess the generality of those other axioms which have been consid 
ered the deduction of the equation x y from the equation zx zy is only 
valid when it is known that z is not equal to if then the value z is sup 
posed to be admissible in the algebraic system the axiom above stated ceases 
to be applicable and the analogy before exemplified remains at least unbroken 

 however it is not with the symbols of quantity generally that it is of 
any importance except as a matter of speculation to trace such affinities we 
have seen ii that the symbols of logic are subject to the special law 

x x 

now of the symbols of number there are but two viz and which are 
subject to the same formal law we know that and that l and 
the equation x x considered as algebraic has no other roots than and 
hence instead of determining the measure of formal agreement of the symbols 
of logic with those of number generally it is more immediately suggested to 
us to compare them with symbols of quantity admitting only of the values 
and let us conceive then of an algebra in which the symbols x y z etc 
admit indifferently of the values and and of these values alone the laws 



chapter ii signs and their laws 


 


the axioms and the processes of such an algebra will be identical in their 
whole extent with the laws the axioms and the processes of an algebra of 
logic difference of interpretation will alone divide them upon this principle 
the method of the following work is established 

 it now remains to show that those constituent parts of ordinary language 
which have not been considered in the previous sections of this chapter are either 
resolvable into the same elements as those which have been considered or are 
subsidiary to those elements by contributing to their more precise definition 

the substantive the adjective and the verb together with the particles 
and except we have already considered the pronoun may be regarded as a 
particular form of the substantive or the adjective the adverb modifies the 
meaning of the verb but does not affect its nature prepositions contribute 
to the expression of circumstance or relation and thus tend to give precision 
and detail to the meaning of the literal symbols the conjunctions if either 
or are used chiefly in the expression of relation among propositions and it 
will hereafter be shown that the same relations can be completely expressed by 
elementary symbols analogous in interpretation and identical in form and law 
with the symbols whose use and meaning have been explained in this chapter 
as to any remaining elements of speech it will upon examination be found that 
they are used either to give a more definite significance to the terms of discourse 
and thus enter into the interpretation of the literal symbols already considered 
or to express some emotion or state of feeling accompanying the utterance of a 
proposition and thus do not belong to the province of the understanding with 
which alone our present concern lies experience of its use will testify to the 
sufficiency of the classification which has been adopted 



chapter iii 

derivation of the laws of the symbols of 
logic from the laws of the operations of 
the human mind 


 the object of science properly so called is the knowledge of laws and re 
lations to be able to distinguish what is essential to this end from what is 
only accidentally associated with it is one of the most important conditions 
of scientific progress i say to distinguish between these elements because a 
consistent devotion to science does not require that the attention should be 
altogether withdrawn from other speculations often of a metaphysical nature 
with which it is not unfrequently connected such questions for instance as 
the existence of a sustaining ground of phaenomena the reality of cause the 
propriety of forms of speech implying that the successive states of things are 
connected by operations and others of a like nature may possess a deep interest 
and significance in relation to science without being essentially scientific it is 
indeed scarcely possible to express the conclusions of natural science without 
borrowing the language of these conceptions nor is there necessarily any prac 
tical inconvenience arising from this source they who believe and they who 
refuse to believe that there is more in the relation of cause and effect than an 
invariable order of succession agree in their interpretation of the conclusions 
of physical astronomy but they only agree because they recognise a common 
element of scientific truth which is independent of their particular views of the 
nature of causation 

 if this distinction is important in physical science much more does it 
deserve attention in connexion with the science of the intellectual powers for 
the questions which this science presents become in expression at least almost 
necessarily mixed up with modes of thought and language which betray a meta 
physical origin the idealist would give to the laws of reasoning one form of 
expression the sceptic if true to his principles another they who regard the 
phaenomena with which we are concerned in this inquiry as the mere succes 
sive states of the thinking subject devoid of any causal connexion and they 
who refer them to the operations of an active intelligence would if consistent 
equally differ in their modes of statement like difference would also result 
from a difference of classification of the mental faculties now the principle 


 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


which i would here assert as affording us the only ground of confidence and 
stability amid so much of seeming and of real diversity is the following viz 
that if the laws in question are really deduced from observation they have a 
real existence as laws of the human mind independently of any metaphysical 
theory which may seem to be involved in the mode of their statement they 
contain an element of truth which no ulterior criticism upon the nature or even 
upon the reality of the mind’s operations can essentially affect let it even 
be granted that the mind is but a succession of states of consciousness a series 
of fleeting impressions uncaused from without or from within emerging out of 
nothing and returning into nothing again — the last refinement of the sceptic 
intellect — still as laws of succession or at least of a past succession the results 
to which observation had led would remain true they would require to be 
interpreted into a language from whose vocabulary all such terms as cause and 
effect operation and subject substance and attribute had been banished but 
they would still be valid as scientific truths 

moreover as any statement of the laws of thought founded upon actual 
observation must thus contain scientific elements which are independent of 
metaphysical theories of the nature of the mind the practical application of 
such elements to the construction of a system or method of reasoning must 
also be independent of metaphysical distinctions for it is upon the scientific 
elements involved in the statement of the laws that any practical application 
will rest just as the practical conclusions of physical astronomy are independent 
of any theory of the cause of gravitation but rest only on the knowledge of 
its phaenomenal effects and therefore as respects both the determination of 
the laws of thought and the practical use of them when discovered we are 
for all really scientific ends unconcerned with the truth or falsehood of any 
metaphysical speculations whatever 

 the course which it appears to me to be expedient under these circum 
stances to adopt is to avail myself as far as possible of the language of common 
discourse without regard to any theory of the nature and powers of the mind 
which it may be thought to embody for instance it is agreeable to common 
usage to say that we converse with each other by the communication of ideas 
or conceptions such communication being the office of words and that with 
reference to any particular ideas or conceptions presented to it the mind pos 
sesses certain powers or faculties by which the mental regard maybe fixed upon 
some ideas to the exclusion of others or by which the given conceptions or 
ideas may in various ways be combined together to those faculties or powers 
different names as attention simple apprehension conception or imagina 
tion abstraction c have been given — names which have not only furnished 
the titles of distinct divisions of the philosophy of the human mind but passed 
into the common language of men whenever then occasion shall occur to use 
these terms i shall do so without implying thereby that i accept the theory 
that the mind possesses such and such powers and faculties as distinct elements 
of its activity nor is it indeed necessary to inquire whether such powers of the 
understanding have a distinct existence or not we may merge these different 
titles under the one generic name of operations of the human mind define these 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


operations so far as is necessary for the purposes of this work and then seek to 
express their ultimate laws such will be the general order of the course which 
i shall pursue though reference will occasionally be made to the names which 
common agreement has assigned to the particular states or operations of the 
mind which may fall under our notice 

it will be most convenient to distribute the more definite results of the 
following investigation into distinct propositions 

proposition i 

 to deduce the laws of the symbols of logic from a consideration of those 
operations of the mind which are implied in the strict use of language as an 
instrument of reasoning 

in every discourse whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts 
or of the individual in his intercourse with others there is an assumed or ex 
pressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined the most 
unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the 
widest possible application and for them the limits of discourse are coextensive 
with those of the universe itself but more usually we confine ourselves to a less 
spacious held sometimes in discoursing of men we imply without expressing 
the limitation that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions 
that we speak as of civilized men or of men in the vigour of life or of men 
under some other condition or relation now whatever may be the extent of 
the held within which all the objects of our discourse are found that held may 
properly be termed the universe of discourse 

 furthermore this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ul 
timate subject of the discourse the office of any name or descriptive term 
employed under the limitations supposed is not to raise in the mind the concep 
tion of all the beings or objects to which that name or description is applicable 
but only of those which exist within the supposed universe of discourse if that 
universe of discourse is the actual universe of things which it always is when 
our words are taken in their real and literal sense then by men we mean all 
men that exist but if the universe of discourse is limited by any antecedent 
implied understanding then it is of men under the limitation thus introduced 
that we speak it is in both cases the business of the word men to direct a 
certain operation of the mind by which from the proper universe of discourse 
we select or fix upon the individuals signified 

 exactly of the same kind is the mental operation implied by the use of 
an adjective let for instance the universe of discourse be the actual universe 
then as the word men directs us to select mentally from that universe all the 
beings to which the term “men” is applicable so the adjective “good” in the 
combination “good men” directs us still further to select mentally from the 
class of men all those who possess the further quality “good” and if another 
adjective were prefixed to the combination “good men” it would direct a further 
operation of the same nature having reference to that further quality which it 
might be chosen to express 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


it is important to notice carefully the real nature of the operation here 
described for it is conceivable that it might have been different from what it is 
were the adjective simply attributive in its character it would seem that when a 
particular set of beings is designated by men the prefixing of the adjective good 
would direct us to attach mentally to all those beings the quality of goodness 
but this is not the real office of the adjective the operation which we really 
perform is one of selection according to a prescribed principle or idea to what 
faculties of the mind such an operation would be referred according to the 
received classification of its powers it is not important to inquire but i suppose 
that it would be considered as dependent upon the two faculties of conception 
or imagination and attention to the one of these faculties might be referred 
the formation of the general conception to the other the fixing of the mental 
regard upon those individuals within the prescribed universe of discourse which 
answer to the conception if however as seems not improbable the power 
of attention is nothing more than the power of continuing the exercise of any 
other faculty of the mind we might properly regard the whole of the mental 
process above described as referrible to the mental faculty of imagination or 
conception the first step of the process being the conception of the universe 
itself and each succeeding step limiting in a definite manner the conception 
thus formed adopting this view i shall describe each such step or any definite 
combination of such steps as a definite act of conception and the use of this 
term i shall extend so as to include in its meaning not only the conception of 
classes of objects represented by particular names or simple attributes of quality 
but also the combination of such conceptions in any manner consistent with the 
powers and limitations of the human mind indeed any intellectual operation 
short of that which is involved in the structure of a sentence or proposition 
the general laws to which such operations of the mind are subject are now to 
be considered 

 now it will be shown that the laws which in the preceding chapter have 
been determined a posteriori from the constitution of language for the use 
of the literal symbols of logic are in reality the laws of that definite mental 
operation which has just been described we commence our discourse with a 
certain understanding as to the limits of its subject ie as to the limits of its 
universe every name every term of description that we employ directs him 
whom we address to the performance of a certain mental operation upon that 
subject and thus is thought communicated but as each name or descriptive 
term is in this view but the representative of an intellectual operation that 
operation being also prior in the order of nature it is clear that the laws of the 
name or symbol must be of a derivative character — must in fact originate in 
those of the operation which they represent that the laws of the symbol and 
of the mental process are identical in expression will now be shown 

 let us then suppose that the universe of our discourse is the actual 
universe so that words are to be used in the full extent of their meaning and 
let us consider the two mental operations implied by the words “white” and 
“men” the word “men” implies the operation of selecting in thought from its 
subject the universe all men and the resulting conception men becomes the 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


subject of the next operation the operation implied by the word “white” is that 
of selecting from its subject “men” all of that class which are white the final 
resulting conception is that of “white men” now it is perfectly apparent that 
if the operations above described had been performed in a converse order the 
result would have been the same whether we begin by forming the conception 
of “men” and then by a second intellectual act limit that conception to “white 
men” or whether we begin by forming the conception of “white objects” and 
then limit it to such of that class as are “men” is perfectly indifferent so far 
as the result is concerned it is obvious that the order of the mental processes 
would be equally indifferent if for the words “white” and “men” we substituted 
any other descriptive or appellative terms whatever provided only that their 
meaning was fixed and absolute and thus the indifference of the order of two 
successive acts of the faculty of conception the one of which furnishes the 
subject upon which the other is supposed to operate is a general condition of 
the exercise of that faculty it is a law of the mind and it is the real origin of 
that law of the literal symbols of logic which constitutes its formal expression 
 chap ii 

 it is equally clear that the mental operation above described is of such 
a nature that its effect is not altered by repetition suppose that by a definite 
act of conception the attention has been fixed upon men and that by another 
exercise of the same faculty we limit it to those of the race who are white then 
any further repetition of the latter mental act by which the attention is limited 
to white objects does not in any way modify the conception arrived at viz 
that of white men this is also an example of a general law of the mind and it 
has its formal expression in the law chap ii of the literal symbols 

 again it is manifest that from the conceptions of two distinct classes 
of things we can form the conception of that collection of things which the two 
classes taken together compose and it is obviously indifferent in what order of 
position or of priority those classes are presented to the mental view this is 
another general law of the mind and its expression is found in chap ii 

 it is not necessary to pursue this course of inquiry and comparison suf 
ficient illustration has been given to render manifest the two following positions 
viz 

first that the operations of the mind by which in the exercise of its 
power of imagination or conception it combines and modifies the simple ideas 
of things or qualities not less than those operations of the reason which are 
exercised upon truths and propositions are subject to general laws 

secondly that those laws are mathematical in their form and that they are 
actually developed in the essential laws of human language wherefore the laws 
of the symbols of logic are deducible from a consideration of the operations of 
the mind in reasoning 

 the remainder of this chapter will be occupied with questions relating 
to that law of thought whose expression is x x ii a law which as has 
been implied ii forms the characteristic distinction of the operations of the 
mind in its ordinary discourse and reasoning as compared with its operations 
when occupied with the general algebra of quantity an important part of the 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


following inquiry will consist in proving that the symbols and occupy a place 
and are susceptible of an interpretation among the symbols of logic and it may 
first be necessary to show how particular symbols such as the above may with 
propriety and advantage be employed in the representation of distinct systems 
of thought 

the ground of this propriety cannot consist in any community of interpreta 
tion for in systems of thought so truly distinct as those of logic and arithmetic 
i use the latter term in its widest sense as the science of number there is 
properly speaking no community of subject the one of them is conversant with 
the very conceptions of things the other takes account solely of their numerical 
relations but inasmuch as the forms and methods of any system of reasoning 
depend immediately upon the laws to which the symbols are subject and only 
mediately through the above link of connexion upon their interpretation there 
may be both propriety and advantage in employing the same symbols in differ 
ent systems of thought provided that such interpretations can be assigned to 
them as shall render their formal laws identical and their use consistent the 
ground of that employment will not then be community of interpretation but 
the community of the formal laws to which in their respective systems they 
are subject nor must that community of formal laws be established upon any 
other ground than that of a careful observation and comparison of those results 
which are seen to flow independently from the interpretations of the systems 
under consideration 

these observations will explain the process of inquiry adopted in the follow 
ing proposition the literal symbols of logic are universally subject to the law 
whose expression is x x of the symbols of number there are two only 
and which satisfy this law but each of these symbols is also subject to a 
law peculiar to itself in the system of numerical magnitude and this suggests 
the inquiry what interpretations must be given to the literal symbols of logic 
in order that the same peculiar and formal laws may be realized in the logical 
system also 


proposition ii 

 to determine the logical value and significance of the symbols and 

the symbol as used in algebra satisfies the following formal law 

 x y or oy 

whatever number y may represent that this formal law may be obeyed in 
the system of logic we must assign to the symbol such an interpretation 
that the class represented by oy may be identical with the class represented 
by whatever the class y may be a little consideration will show that this 
condition is satisfied if the symbol represent nothing in accordance with a 
previous definition we may term nothing a class in fact nothing and universe 
are the two limits of class extension for they are the limits of the possible 
interpretations of general names none of which can relate to fewer individuals 
than are comprised in nothing or to more than are comprised in the universe 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


now whatever the class y may be the individuals which are common to it and to 
the class “nothing” are identical with those comprised in the class “nothing” 
for they are none and thus by assigning to the interpretation nothing the law 
 is satisfied and it is not otherwise satisfied consistently with the perfectly 
general character of the class y 

secondly the symbol satisfies in the system of number the following law 
viz 

 xy y or y y 

whatever number y may represent and this formal equation being assumed as 
equally valid in the system of this work in which and y represent classes it 
appears that the symbol must represent such a class that all the individuals 
which are found in any proposed class y are also all the individuals y that are 
common to that class y and the class represented by a little consideration 
will here show that the class represented by must be “the universe” since this 
is the only class in which are found all the individuals that exist in any class 
hence the respective interpretations of the symbols and in the system of 
logic are nothing and universe 

 as with the idea of any class of objects as “men” there is suggested 
to the mind the idea of the contrary class of beings which are not men and 
as the whole universe is made up of these two classes together since of every 
individual which it comprehends we may affirm either that it is a man or that 
it is not a man it becomes important to inquire how such contrary names are 
to be expressed such is the object of the following proposition 

proposition iii 

if x represent any class of objects then will — x represent the contrary or 
supplementary class of objects ie the class including all objects which are not 
comprehended in the class x 

for greater distinctness of conception let x represent the class men and let 
us express according to the last proposition the universe by now if from the 
conception of the universe as consisting of “men” and “notmen” we exclude 
the conception of “men” the resulting conception is that of the contrary class 
“notmen” hence the class “notmen” will be represented by — x and in 
general whatever class of objects is represented by the symbol x the contrary 
class will be expressed by — x 

 although the following proposition belongs in strictness to a future 
chapter of this work devoted to the subject of maxims or necessary truths yet 
on account of the great importance of that law of thought to which it relates 
it has been thought proper to introduce it here 

proposition iv 

that axiom of metaphysicians which is termed the principle of contradiction 
and which affirms that it is impossible for any being to possess a quality and 
at the same time not to possess it is a consequence of the fundamental law of 
thought whose expression is x x 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


let us write this equation in the form 

x — x 

whence we have 

x — x 

both these transformations being justified by the axiomatic laws of combination 
and transposition ii let us for simplicity of conception give to the 
symbol x the particular interpretation of men then — x will represent the 
class of “notmen” prop iii now the formal product of the expressions of 
two classes represents that class of individuals which is common to them both 
ii hence xl — x will represent the class whose members are at once 
“men” and “not men” and the equation thus express the principle that 
a class whose members are at the same time men and not men does not exist 
in other words that it is impossible for the same individual to be at the same 
time a man and not a man now let the meaning of the symbol x be extended 
from the representing of “men” to that of any class of beings characterized by 
the possession of any quality whatever and the equation will then express 
that it is impossible for a being to possess a quality and not to possess that 
quality at the same time but this is identically that “principle of contradiction” 
which aristotle has described as the fundamental axiom of all philosophy “it 
is impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the 
same thing this is the most certain of all principles wherefore they who 
demonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion for it is by nature the source 
of all the other axioms” 

the above interpretation has been introduced not on account of its imme 
diate value in the present system but as an illustration of a significant fact in 
the philosophy of the intellectual powers viz that what has been commonly 
regarded as the fundamental axiom of metaphysics is but the consequence of a 
law of thought mathematical in its form i desire to direct attention also to the 
circumstance that the equation in which that fundamental law of thought 
is expressed is an equation of the second degree without speculating at all

ooav rpuaei yap dpir xai xov oaaov deopiaxov agxr xavxov — metaphysica iii 

 should it here be said that the existence of the equation x x necessitates also the 
existence of the equation x x which is of the third degree and then inquired whether that 
equation does not indicate a process of trichotomy the answer is that the equation x x 
is not interpretable in the system of logic for writing it in either of the forms 

x — x x 

x — x — — x 

we see that its interpretation if possible at all must involve that of the factor x or of the 
factor — — x the former is not interpretable because we cannot conceive of the addition 
of any class x to the universe the latter is not interpretable because the symbol — is not 
subject to the law x — x to which all class symbols are subject hence the equation 
x x admits of no interpretation analogous to that of the equation x x were the former 
equation however true independently of the latter ie were that act of the mind which is 



chapter iii derivation of the laws 


 


in this chapter upon the question whether that circumstance is necessary in 
its own nature we may venture to assert that if it had not existed the whole 
procedure of the understanding would have been different from what it is thus 
it is a consequence of the fact that the fundamental equation of thought is of 
the second degree that we perform the operation of analysis and classification 
by division into pairs of opposites or as it is technically said by dichotomy 
now if the equation in question had been of the third degree still admitting 
of interpretation as such the mental division must have been threefold in char 
acter and we must have proceeded by a species of trichotomy the real nature 
of which it is impossible for us with our existing faculties adequately to con 
ceive but the laws of which we might still investigate as an object of intellectual 
speculation 

 the law of thought expressed by the equation will for reasons which 
are made apparent by the above discussion be occasionally referred to as the 
“law of duality” 


denoted by the symbol x such that its second repetition should reproduce the result of a 
single operation but not its first or mere repetition it is presumable that we should be able 
to interpret one of the forms which under the actual conditions of thought we cannot 
do there exist operations known to the mathematician the law of which may be adequately 
expressed by the equation x x but they are of a nature altogether foreign to the province 
of general reasoning 

in saying that it is conceivable that the law of thought might have been different from what 
it is i mean only that we can frame such an hypothesis and study its consequences the 
possibility of doing this involves no such doctrine as that the actual law of human reason is 
the product either of chance or of arbitrary will 



chapter iv 

of the division of propositions into the 
two classes of “primary” and 
“secondary” of the characteristic 
properties of those classes and of the 
laws of the expression of primary 
propositions 


 the laws of those mental operations which are concerned in the processes of 
conception or imagination having been investigated and the corresponding laws 
of the symbols by which they are represented explained we are led to consider 
the practical application of the results obtained first in the expression of the 
complex terms of propositions secondly in the expression of propositions and 
lastly in the construction of a general method of deductive analysis in the 
present chapter we shall be chiefly concerned with the first of these objects as 
an introduction to which it is necessary to establish the following proposition 

proposition i 

all logical propositions may be considered as belonging to one or the other 
of two great classes to which the respective names of “ primary ” or “concrete 
propositions” and “secondary” or “abstract propositions” may be given 

every assertion that we make may be referred to one or the other of the two 
following kinds either it expresses a relation among things or it expresses or 
is equivalent to the expression of a relation among propositions an assertion 
respecting the properties of things or the phaenomena which they manifest or 
the circumstances in which they are placed is properly speaking the assertion 
of a relation among things to say that “snow is white” is for the ends of 
logic equivalent to saying that “snow is a white thing” an assertion respecting 
facts or events their mutual connexion and dependence is for the same ends 
generally equivalent to the assertion that such and such propositions concern 
ing those events have a certain relation to each other as respects their mutual 
truth or falsehood the former class of propositions relating to things i call 
“primary” the latter class relating to propositions i call “secondary” the 


 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


distinction is in practice nearly but not quite coextensive with the common 
logical distinction of propositions as categorical or hypothetical 

for instance the propositions “the sun shines” “the earth is warmed” are 
primary the proposition “if the sun shines the earth is warmed” is secondary 
to say “the sun shines” is to say “the sun is that which shines” and it 
expresses a relation between two classes of things viz “the sun” and “things 
which shine” the secondary proposition however given above expresses a 
relation of dependence between the two primary propositions “the sun shines” 
and “the earth is warmed” i do not hereby affirm that the relation between 
these propositions is like that which exists between the facts which they express 
a relation of causality but only that the relation among the propositions so 
implies and is so implied by the relation among the facts that it may for the 
ends of logic be used as a fit representative of that relation 

 if instead of the proposition “the sun shines” we say “it is true that 
the sun shines” we then speak not directly of things but of a proposition 
concerning things viz of the proposition “the sun shines” and therefore 
the proposition in which we thus speak is a secondary one every primary 
proposition may thus give rise to a secondary proposition viz to that secondary 
proposition which asserts its truth or declares its falsehood 

it will usually happen that the particles if either or will indicate that 
a proposition is secondary but they do not necessarily imply that such is the 
case the proposition “animals are either rational or irrational” is primary it 
cannot be resolved into “either animals are rational or animals are irrational” 
and it does not therefore express a relation of dependence between the two 
propositions connected together in the latter disjunctive sentence the particles 
either or are in fact no criterion of the nature of propositions although it 
happens that they are more frequently found in secondary propositions even 
the conjunction if may be found in primary propositions “men are if wise 
then temperate” is an example of the kind it cannot be resolved into “if all 
men are wise then all men are temperate” 

 as it is not my design to discuss the merits or defects of the ordinary 
division of propositions i shall simply remark here that the principle upon 
which the present classification is founded is clear and definite in its application 
that it involves a real and fundamental distinction in propositions and that it 
is of essential importance to the development of a general method of reasoning 
nor does the fact that a primary proposition may be put into a form in which 
it becomes secondary at all conflict with the views here maintained for in the 
case thus supposed it is not of the things connected together in the primary 
proposition that any direct account is taken but only of the proposition itself 
considered as true or as false 

 in the expression both of primary and of secondary propositions the 
same symbols subject as it will appear to the same laws will be employed 
in this work the difference between the two cases is a difference not of form 
but of interpretation in both cases the actual relation which it is the object 
of the proposition to express will be denoted by the sign in the expression 
of primary propositions the members thus connected will usually represent the 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


“terms” of a proposition or as they are more particularly designated its subject 
and predicate 


proposition ii 

 to deduce a general method founded upon the enumeration of possible 
varieties for the expression of any class or collection of things which may 
constitute a “term v of a primary proposition 

first if the class or collection of things to be expressed is defined only 
by names or qualities common to all the individuals of which it consists its 
expression will consist of a single term in which the symbols expressive of those 
names or qualities will be combined without any connecting sign as if by the 
algebraic process of multiplication thus if x represent opaque substances y 
polished substances stones we shall have 

xyz opaque polished stones 

xy — z opaque polished substances which are not stones 

xl — yl — z opaque substances which are not polished and are not 

stones 

and so on for any other combination let it be observed that each of these 
expressions satisfies the same law of duality as the individual symbols which it 
contains thus 


xyz x xyz xyz 

xy — z x xyl — z xy — 

and so on any such term as the above we shall designate as a “class term” 
because it expresses a class of things by means of the common properties or 
names of the individual members of such class 

secondly if we speak of a collection of things different portions of which are 
defined by different properties names or attributes the expressions for those 
different portions must be separately formed and then connected by the sign 
but if the collection of which we desire to speak has been formed by excluding 
from some wider collection a defined portion of its members the sign — must 
be prefixed to the symbolical expression of the excluded portion respecting 
the use of these symbols some further observations may be added 

 speaking generally the symbol is the equivalent of the conjunctions 
“and” “or” and the symbol — the equivalent of the preposition “except” of 
the conjunctions “and” and “or” the former is usually employed when the col 
lection to be described forms the subject the latter when it forms the predicate 
of a proposition “the scholar and the man of the world desire happiness” may 
be taken as an illustration of one of these cases “things possessing utility are 
either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain” may exemplify the other 
now whenever an expression involving these particles presents itself in a pri 
mary proposition it becomes very important to know whether the groups or 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


classes separated in thought by them are intended to be quite distinct from 
each other and mutually exclusive or not does the expression “scholars and 
men of the world” include or exclude those who are both does the expression 
“either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain” include or exclude things 
which possess both these qualities i apprehend that in strictness of meaning 
the conjunctions “and” “or” do possess the power of separation or exclusion 
here referred to that the formula “all x’s are either y’ s or z’s” rigorously 
interpreted means “all x’s are either y’ s but not z’s” or “z’s but not y’ s” 
but it must at the same time be admitted that the “jus et norma loquendi” 
seems rather to favour an opposite interpretation the expression “either y’s 
or z’s” would generally be understood to include things that are y’s and z’s 
at the same time together with things which come under the one but not the 
other remembering however that the symbol does possess the separating 
power which has been the subject of discussion we must resolve any disjunctive 
expression which may come before us into elements really separated in thought 
and then connect their respective expressions by the symbol 

and thus according to the meaning implied the expression “things which 
are either x’s or y’s” will have two different symbolical equivalents if we mean 
“things which are x’s but not y’s or y’s but not x’s” the expression will be 

xl y yl x 

the symbol x standing for x’s y for y’s if however we mean “things which 
are either x’s or if not x’s then y’s” the expression will be 

x yl — x 

this expression supposes the admissibility of things which are both x’s and y’s 
at the same time it might more fully be expressed in the form 

xy xly ylx 

but this expression on addition of the two first terms only reproduces the 
former one 

let it be observed that the expressions above given satisfy the fundamental 
law of duality iii thus we have 

xly ylx xly ylx 

x — x x yl — x 


it will be seen hereafter that this is but a particular manifestation of a general 
law of expressions representing “classes or collections of things” 

 the results of these investigations may be embodied in the following rule 
of expression 

rule — express simple names or qualities by the symbols x y z c their 
contraries by — x — y — z c classes of things defined by common 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


names or qualities by connecting the corresponding symbols as in multiplica 
tion collections of things consisting of portions different from each other by 
connecting the expressions of those portions by the sign in particular let 
the expression “either x’s or y’s” be expressed by xl — y y — x when 
the classes denoted by x and y are exclusive by x y — x when they are not 
exclusive similarly let the expression “either x ’s or y ’s or z ’s ” be expressed 
by xl — yl — zyl—xl — z zl—xl — y when the classes denoted by x 
y and z are designed to be mutually exclusive by x yl — a — xl — y 
when they are not meant to be exclusive and so on 

 on this rule of expression is founded the converse rule of interpretation 
both these will be exemplified with perhaps sufficient fulness in the following 
instances omitting for brevity the universal subject “things” or “beings” let 
us assume 

x hard y elastic metals 
and we shall have the following results 

“nonelastic metals” will be expressed by z — y 

“elastic substances with nonelastic metals” by y z — y 

“hard substances except metals” by x — z 

“metallic substances except those which are neither hard nor elastic” by 
 — — xl — y or by — — xl — y vide chap ii 

in the last example what we had really to express was “metals except not 
hard not elastic metals” conjunctions used between adjectives are usually 
superfluous and therefore must not be expressed symbolically 

thus “metals hard and elastic” is equivalent to “hard elastic metals” and 
expressed by xyz 

take next the expression “hard substances except those which are metal 
lic and nonelastic and those which are elastic and nonmetallic” here the 
word those means hard substances so that the expression really means hard 
substances except hard substances metallic nonelastic and hard substances 
nonmetallic elastic the word except extending to both the classes which fol 
low it the complete expression is 

x a l y xy 

or x — xz — y — xyl — 


 the preceding proposition with the different illustrations which have 
been given of it is a necessary preliminary to the following one which will 
complete the design of the present chapter 


proposition iii 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


to deduce from an examination of their possible varieties a general method 
for the expression of primary or concrete propositions 

a primary proposition in the most general sense consists of two terms 
between which a relation is asserted to exist these terms are not necessarily 
singleworded names but may represent any collection of objects such as we 
have been engaged in considering in the previous sections the mode of ex 
pressing those terms is therefore comprehended in the general precepts above 
given and it only remains to discover how the relations between the terms are 
to be expressed this will evidently depend upon the nature of the relation 
and more particularly upon the question whether in that relation the terms 
are understood to be universal or particular ie whether we speak of the whole 
of that collection of objects to which a term refers or indefinitely of the whole 
or of a part of it the usual signification of the prefix “some” 

suppose that we wish to express a relation of identity between the two 
classes “fixed stars” and “suns” ie to express that “all fixed stars are 
suns” and “all suns are fixed stars” here if x stand for fixed stars and y for 
suns we shall have 

x y 

for the equation required 

in the proposition “all fixed stars are suns” the term “all fixed stars” would 
be called the subject and “ suns” the predicate suppose that we extend the 
meaning of the terms subject and predicate in the following manner by subject 
let us mean the first term of any affirmative proposition i e the term which 
precedes the copula is or are and by predicate let us agree to mean the second 
term ie the one which follows the copula and let us admit the assumption 
that either of these may be universal or particular so that in either case the 
whole class may be implied or only a part of it then we shall have the following 
rule for cases such as the one in the last example 

 rule — when both subject and predicate of a proposition are universal 
form the separate expressions for them and connect them by the sign 

this case will usually present itself in the expression of the definitions of 
science or of subjects treated after the manner of pure science mr senior’s 
definition of wealth affords a good example of this kind viz 

“wealth consists of things transferable limited in supply and either pro 
ductive of pleasure or preventive of pain” 

before proceeding to express this definition symbolically it must be remarked 
that the conjunction and is superfluous wealth is really defined by its posses 
sion of three properties or qualities not by its composition out of three classes 
or collections of objects omitting then the conjunction and let us make 

w wealth 
t things transferable 
s limited in supply 
p productive of pleasure 
r preventive of pain 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


now it is plain from the nature of the subject that the expression “either 
productive of pleasure or preventive of pain” in the above definition is meant 
to be equivalent to “either productive of pleasure or if not productive of plea 
sure preventive of pain” thus the class of things which the above expression 
taken alone would define would consist of all things productive of pleasure 
together with all things not productive of pleasure but preventive of pain and 
its symbolical expression would be 

p — pr 

if then we attach to this expression placed in brackets to denote that both 
its terms are referred to the symbols s and t limiting its application to things 
“transferable” and “limited in supply” we obtain the following symbolical equiv 
alent for the original definition viz 

w stp rl — p 

if the expression “either productive of pleasure or preventive of pain” were 
intended to point out merely those things which are productive of pleasure 
without being preventive of pain pl — r or preventive of pain without being 
productive of pleasure rl —p exclusion being made of those things which are 
both productive of pleasure and preventive of pain the expression in symbols 
of the definition would be 

w stpl — r rl — p 

all this agrees with what has before been more generally stated the reader 
may be curious to inquire what effect would be produced if we literally translated 
the expression “things productive of pleasure or preventive of pain” by p r 
making the symbolical equation of the definition to be 

w stp r 

the answer is that this expression would be equivalent to with the 
additional implication that the classes of things denoted by stp and str are 
quite distinct so that of things transferable and limited in supply there exist 
none in the universe which are at the same time both productive of pleasure and 
preventive of pain how the full import of any equation may be determined will 
be explained hereafter what has been said may show that before attempting to 
translate our data into the rigorous language of symbols it is above all things 
necessary to ascertain the intended import of the words we are using but 
this necessity cannot be regarded as an evil by those who value correctness of 
thought and regard the right employment of language as both its instrument 
and its safeguard 

 let us consider next the case in which the predicate of the proposition 
is particular eg “all men are mortal” 

in this case it is clear that our meaning is “all men are some mortal be 
ings” and we must seek the expression of the predicate “some mortal beings” 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


represent then by v a class indefinite in every respect but this viz that some 
of its members are mortal beings and let x stand for “mortal beings” then 
will vx represent “some mortal beings” hence if y represent men the equation 
sought will be 

y vx 

from such considerations we derive the following rule for expressing an 
affirmative universal proposition whose predicate is particular 

rule — express as before the subject and the predicate attach to the latter 
the indefinite symbol v and equate the expressions 

it is obvious that v is a symbol of the same kind as x y c and that it is 
subject to the general law 


v v orv — v 

thus to express the proposition “the planets are either primary or sec 
ondary” we should according to the rule proceed thus 

let x represent planets the subject 

y primary bodies 

 secondary bodies 

then assuming the conjunction “or” to separate absolutely the class of “pri 
mary” from that of “secondary” bodies so far as they enter into our consider 
ation in the proposition given we find for the equation of the proposition 

x vylz zly 

it may be worth while to notice that in this case the literal translation of the 
premises into the form 

x vy z 

would be exactly equivalent v being an indefinite class symbol the form 
 is however the better as the expression 

y z y 

consists of terms representing classes quite distinct from each other and 
satisfies the fundamental law of duality 

if we take the proposition “the heavenly bodies are either suns or planets 
or comets” representing these classes of things by w x y z respectively its 
expression on the supposition that none of the heavenly bodies belong at once 
to two of the divisions above mentioned will be 

w v x — y — z y — x — z z — x — y 

if however it were meant to be implied that the heavenly bodies were 
either suns or if not suns planets or if neither suns nor planets fixed stars 
a meaning which does not exclude the supposition of some of them belonging at 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


once to two or to all three of the divisions of suns planets and fixed stars — the 
expression required would be 

w v x y — x z — x — y 

the above examples belong to the class of descriptions not definitions in 
deed the predicates of propositions are usually particular when this is not the 
case either the predicate is a singular term or we employ instead of the copula 
“is” or “are” some form of connexion which implies that the predicate is to be 
taken universally 

 consider next the case of universal negative propositions eg “no men 
are perfect beings” 

now it is manifest that in this case we do not speak of a class termed “no 
men” and assert of this class that all its members are “perfect beings” but 
we virtually make an assertion about “ all men to the effect that they are “not 
perfect beings ” thus the true meaning of the proposition is this 

“all men subject are copula not perfect predicate” whence if y repre 
sent “men” and x “perfect beings” we shall have 

y v x 

and similarly in any other case thus we have the following rule 

rule — to express any proposition of the form “no x’s are y’s” convert it 
into the form “all x ’s are not y ’s ” and then proceed as in the previous case 

 consider lastly the case in which the subject of the proposition is 
particular eg “some men are not wise” here as has been remarked the 
negative not may properly be referred certainly at least for the ends of logic 
to the predicate wise for we do not mean to say that it is not true that “some 
men are wise” but we intend to predicate of “some men” a want of wisdom the 
requisite form of the given proposition is therefore “some men are notwise” 
putting then y for “men” x for “wise” i e “wise beings” and introducing v 
as the symbol of a class indefinite in all respects but this that it contains some 
individuals of the class to whose expression it is prefixed we have 

vy v — x 

 we may comprise all that we have determined in the following general 
rule 


general rule for the symbolical expression of primary 

propositions 

st if the proposition is affirmative form the expression of the subject 
and that of the predicate should either of them be particular attach to it the 
indefinite symbol v and then equate the resulting expressions 

ndly if the proposition is negative express first its true meaning by attach 
ing the negative particle to the predicate then proceed as above 

one or two additional examples may suffice for illustration 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


ex — “no men are placed in exalted stations and free from envious regards” 
let y represent “men” x “placed in exalted stations” z “free from envious 
regards” 

now the expression of the class described as “placed in exalted station” and 
“free from envious regards” is xz hence the contrary class ie they to whom 
this description does not apply will be represented by — xz and to this class 
all men are referred hence we have 

y v — xz 

if the proposition thus expressed had been placed in the equiva lent form “men 
in exalted stations are not free from envious regards” its expression would have 
been 

yx v — z 

it will hereafter appear that this expression is really equivalent to the previous 
one on the particular hypothesis involved viz that v is an indefinite class 
symbol 

ex — “no men are heroes but those who unite selfdenial to courage” 

let x “men” y “heroes” “those who practise selfdenial” w “those 
who possess courage” 

the assertion really is that “men who do not possess courage and practise 
selfdenial are not heroes” 

hence we have 

x — zw v — y 

for the equation required 

 in closing this chapter it may be interesting to compare together the 
great leading types of propositions symbolically expressed if we agree to rep 
resent by x and y the symbolical expressions of the “terms” or things related 
those types will be 


x vy 
x y 
vx vy 


in the first the predicate only is particular in the second both terms are 
universal in the third both are particular some minor forms are really included 
under these thus if y the second form becomes 

x 


and if y it becomes 

x 

both which forms admit of interpretation it is further to be noticed that 
the expressions x and y if founded upon a sufficiently careful analysis of the 



chapter iv division of propositions 


 


meaning of the “terms” of the proposition will satisfy the fundamental law of 
duality which requires that we have 

x x or x x 

y y or y y 



chapter v 


of the fundamental principles of 
symbolical reasoning and of the 
expansion or development of expressions 
involving logical symbols 


 the previous chapters of this work have been devoted to the investigation of 
the fundamental laws of the operations of the mind in reasoning of their devel 
opment in the laws of the symbols of logic and of the principles of expression 
by which that species of propositions called primary may be represented in the 
language of symbols these inquiries have been in the strictest sense prelim 
inary they form an indispensable introduction to one of the chief objects of 
this treatise — the construction of a system or method of logic upon the basis 
of an exact summary of the fundamental laws of thought there are certain 
considerations touching the nature of this end and the means of its attainment 
to which i deem it necessary here to direct attention 

 i would remark in the first place that the generality of a method in logic 
must very much depend upon the generality of its elementary processes and 
laws we have for instance in the previous sections of this work investigated 
among other things the laws of that logical process of addition which is sym 
bolized by the sign now those laws have been determined from the study of 
instances in all of which it has been a necessary condition that the classes or 
things added together in thought should be mutually exclusive the expression 
x y seems indeed uninterpretable unless it be assumed that the things rep 
resented by x and the things represented by y are entirely separate that they 
embrace no individuals in common and conditions analogous to this have been 
involved in those acts of conception from the study of which the laws of the 
other symbolical operations have been ascertained the question then arises 
whether it is necessary to restrict the application of these symbolical laws and 
processes by the same conditions of interpretability under which the knowledge 
of them was obtained if such restriction is necessary it is manifest that no 
such thing as a general method in logic is possible on the other hand if such 
restriction is unnecessary in what light are we to contemplate processes which 
appear to be uninterpretable in that sphere of thought which they are designed 
to aid these questions do not belong to the science of logic alone they are 


 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


equally pertinent to every developed form of human reasoning which is based 
upon the employment of a symbolical language 

 i would observe in the second place that this apparent failure of corre 
spondency between process and interpretation does not manifest itself in the 
ordinary applications of human reason for no operations are there performed 
of which the meaning and the application are not seen and to most minds 
it does not suffice that merely formal reasoning should connect their premises 
and their conclusions but every step of the connecting train every mediate 
result which is established in the course of demonstration must be intelligible 
also and without doubt this is both an actual condition and an important 
safeguard in the reasonings and discourses of common life 

there are perhaps many who would be disposed to extend the same princi 
ple to the general use of symbolical language as an instrument of reasoning it 
might be argued that as the laws or axioms which govern the use of symbols are 
established upon an investigation of those cases only in which interpretation is 
possible we have no right to extend their application to other cases in which in 
terpretation is impossible or doubtful even though as should be admitted such 
application is employed in the intermediate steps of demonstration only were 
this objection conclusive it must be acknowledged that slight advantage would 
accrue from the use of a symbolical method in logic perhaps that advantage 
would be confined to the mechanical gain of employing short and convenient 
symbols in the place of more cumbrous ones but the objection itself is falla 
cious whatever our a priori anticipations might be it is an unquestionable fact 
that the validity of a conclusion arrived at by any symbolical process of reason 
ing does not depend upon our ability to interpret the formal results which have 
presented themselves in the different stages of the investigation there exist in 
fact certain general principles relating to the use of symbolical methods which 
as pertaining to the particular subject of logic i shall first state and i shall 
then offer some remarks upon the nature and upon the grounds of their claim 
to acceptance 

 the conditions of valid reasoning by the aid of symbols are — 

st that a fixed interpretation be assigned to the symbols employed in the 
expression of the data and that the laws of the combination of those symbols 
be correctly determined from that interpretation 

nd that the formal processes of solution or demonstration be conducted 
throughout in obedience to all the laws determined as above without regard to 
the question of the interpretability of the particular results obtained 

rd that the final result be interpretable in form and that it be actually 
interpreted in accordance with that system of interpretation which has been em 
ployed in the expression of the data concerning these principles the following 
observations may be made 

 the necessity of a fixed interpretation of the symbols has already been 
sufficiently dwelt upon ii the necessity that the fixed result should be in 
such a form as to admit of that interpretation being applied is founded on the 
obvious principle that the use of symbols is a means towards an end that end 
being the knowledge of some intelligible fact or truth and that this end may

be attained the final result which expresses the symbolical conclusion must be 
in an interpretable form it is however in connexion with the second of the 
above general principles or conditions v that the greatest difficulty is likely 
to be felt and upon this point a few additional words are necessary 

i would then remark that the principle in question may be considered as 
resting upon a general law of the mind the knowledge of which is not given 
to us a priori ie antecedently to experience but is derived like the knowl 
edge of the other laws of the mind from the clear manifestation of the general 
principle in the particular instance a single example of reasoning in which 
symbols are employed in obedience to laws founded upon their interpretation 
but without any sustained reference to that interpretation the chain of demon 
stration conducting us through intermediate steps which are not interpretable 
to a final result which is interpretable seems not only to establish the validity 
of the particular application but to make known to us the general law mani 
fested therein no accumulation of instances can properly add weight to such 
evidence it may furnish us with clearer conceptions of that common element 
of truth upon which the application of the principle depends and so prepare 
the way for its reception it may where the immediate force of the evidence is 
not felt serve as a verification a posteriori of the practical validity of the prin 
ciple in question but this does not affect the position affirmed viz that the 
general principle must be seen in the particular instance — seen to be general 
in application as well as true in the special example the employment of the 
uninterpretable symbol j — in the intermediate processes of trigonometry fur 
nishes an illustration of what has been said i apprehend that there is no mode 
of explaining that application which does not covertly assume the very principle 
in question but that principle though not as i conceive warranted by formal 
reasoning based upon other grounds seems to deserve a place among those ax 
iomatic truths which constitute in some sense the foundation of the possibility 
of general knowledge and which may properly be regarded as expressions of the 
mind’s own laws and constitution 

 the following is the mode in which the principle above stated will be ap 
plied in the present work it has been seen that any system of propositions may 
be expressed by equations involving symbols x y z which whenever interpre 
tation is possible are subject to laws identical in form with the laws of a system 
of quantitative symbols susceptible only of the values and ii but as 
the formal processes of reasoning depend only upon the laws of the symbols 
and not upon the nature of their interpretation we are permitted to treat the 
above symbols x y z as if they were quantitative symbols of the kind above 
described we may in fact lay aside the logical interpretation of the symbols 
in the given equation convert them into quantitative symbols susceptible only 
of the values and perform upon them as such all the requisite processes of 
solution and finally restore to them their logical interpretation and this is the 
mode of procedure which will actually be adopted though it will be deemed 
unnecessary to restate in every instance the nature of the transformation em 
ployed the processes to which the symbols x y z regarded as quantitative 
and of the species above described are subject are not limited by those condi 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


tions of thought to which they would if performed upon purely logical symbols 
be subject and a freedom of operation is given to us in the use of them without 
which the inquiry after a general method in logic would be a hopeless quest 

now the above system of processes would conduct us to no intelligible result 
unless the final equations resulting therefrom were in a form which should ren 
der their interpretation after restoring to the symbols their logical significance 
possible there exists however a general method of reducing equations to such 
a form and the remainder of this chapter will be devoted to its consideration 
i shall say little concerning the way in which the method renders interpretation 
possible — this point being reserved for the next chapter but shall chiefly con 
fine myself here to the mere process employed which may be characterized as a 
process of “development” as introductory to the nature of this process it may 
be proper first to make a few observations 

 suppose that we are considering any class of things with reference to this 
question viz the relation in which its members stand as to the possession or 
the want of a certain property x as every individual in the proposed class either 
possesses or does not possess the property in question we may divide the class 
into two portions the former consisting of those individuals which possess the 
latter of those which do not possess the property this possibility of dividing 
in thought the whole class into two constituent portions is antecedent to all 
knowledge of the constitution of the class derived from any other source of 
which knowledge the effect can only be to inform us more or less precisely to 
what further conditions the portions of the class which possess and which do 
not possess the given property are subject suppose then such knowledge is 
to the following effect viz that the members of that portion which possess the 
property x possess also a certain property it and that these conditions united 
are a sufficient definition of them we may then represent that portion of the 
original class by the expression ux ii if further we obtain information 
that the members of the original class which do not possess the property x are 
subject to a condition v and are thus defined it is clear that those members 
will be represented by the expression v — x hence the class in its totality 
will be represented by 

ux v — x 

which may be considered as a general developed form for the expression of any 
class of objects considered with reference to the possession or the want of a 
given property x 

the general form thus established upon purely logical grounds may also be 
deduced from distinct considerations of formal law applicable to the symbols 
x y z equally in their logical and in their quantitative interpretation already 
referred to v 

 definition — any algebraic expression involving a symbol x is termed a 
function of x and may be represented under the abbreviated general form x 
any expression involving two symbols x and y is similarly termed a function 
of x and y and may be represented under the general form x y and so on 
for any other case 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


thus the form x would indifferently represent any of the following func 
tions viz x — x c and f xy would equally represent any of the 
forms x y x — y c 

on the same principles of notation if in any function x we change x into 
 the result will be expressed by the form if in the same function we 
change x into the result will be expressed by the form thus if x 
represent the function ffg will represent and will represent 

a 
a 

 definition any function x in which x is a logical symbol or a 
symbol of quantity susceptible only of the values and is said to be developed 
when it is reduced to the form ax b — x a and b being so determined as 
to make the result equivalent to the function from which it was derived 

this definition assumes that it is possible to represent any function x in 
the form supposed the assumption is vindicated in the following proposition 

proposition i 

 to develop any function f x in which x is a logical symbol 

by the principle which has been asserted in this chapter it is lawful to treat 
x as a quantitative symbol susceptible only of the values and 

assume then 

 x ax b — x 

and making x we have 

l a 

again in the same equation making x we have 

 

hence the values of a and b are determined and substituting them in the first 
equation we have 

f x f lx f x 

as the development sought the second member of the equation adequately 
represents the function whatever the form of that function may be for 

lr to some it may be interesting to remark that the development of x obtained in this 
chapter strictly holds in the logical system the place of the expansion of in ascending 
powers of x in the system of ordinary algebra thus it may be obtained by introducing into 
the expression of taylor’s wellknown theorem viz 

 oi r c 

the condition xl — x whence we find x x x x c and 

fx f cj x 

but making in x we get 

f f 

l o laj c 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


x regarded as a quantitative symbol admits only of the values and and for 
each of these values the development 

flx f lx 

assumes the same value as the function x 

as an illustration let it be required to develop the function here 

when x we find and when x we find or hence 
the expression required is 

 a x 

yti r x ’ 

and this equation is satisfied for each of the values of which the symbol x is 
susceptible 


proposition ii 

to expand or develop a function involving any number of logical symbols 
let us begin with the case in which there are two symbols x and y and let 
us represent the function to be developed by xy 

first considering xy as a function of x alone and expanding it by the 
general theorem we have 

fxy f lyx f ylx 

wherein fly represents what the proposed function becomes when in it 
for x we write and y what the said function becomes when in it for x 
we write 

now taking the coefficient f ly and regarding it as a function of y and 
expanding it accordingly we have 

l my lly 

wherein represents what y becomes when y is made equal to and 
 what y becomes when y is made equal to 

in like manner the coefficient y gives by expansion 

 y j — 

whence 

f 

 fee l 
and becomes on substitution 

 o l x 

 lai l x 


the form in question this demonstration in supposing x to be developable in a series of 
ascending powers of x is less general than the one in the text 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


substitute in for fly fy their values given in and and we 
have 


f x y f xy f x y xy 

lly 

for the expansion required here represents what f x y becomes when 
we make therein x y represents what xy becomes when 
we make therein x y and so on for the rest 

thus if xy represent the function we find 

m ° ° 

whence the expansion of the given function is 

xy ox y x y x y ¦ 

it will in the next chapter be seen that the forms and jj the former of which 
is known to mathematicians as the symbol of indeterminate quantity admit in 
such expressions as the above of a very important logical interpretation 

suppose in the next place that we have three symbols in the function 
to be expanded which we may represent under the general form fxyz 
proceeding as before we get 


fxyz xyz f xyl — z f lxl — y z 

 x — y — z x yz 

 f — x y — z x yz 

 — ar — y — z 

in which represents what the function fxyz becomes when we 
make therein x y z and so on for the rest 

 it is now easy to see the general law which determines the expansion 
of any proposed function and to reduce the method of effecting the expansion 
to a rule but before proceeding to the expression of such a rule it will be 
convenient to premise the following observations — 

each form of expansion that we have obtained consists of certain terms 
into which the symbols x y c enter multiplied by coefficients into which 
those symbols do not enter thus the expansion of x consists of two terms 
x and — x multiplied by the coefficients and respectively and 
the expansion of x y consists of the four terms xy x — y — x y and 
 — x — y multiplied by the coefficients 
respectively the terms x — x in the former case and the terms xy x — y 
c in the latter we shall call the constituents of the expansion it is evident 
that they are in form independent of the form of the function to be expanded 
of the constituent xy x and y are termed the factors 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


the general rule of development will therefore consist of two parts the first 
of which will relate to the formation of the constituents of the expansion the 
second to the determination of their respective coefficients it is as follows 

st to expand any function of the symbols x y z — form a series of con 
stituents in the following manner let the first constituent be the product of 
the symbols change in this product any symbol z into — z for the second 
constituent then in both these change any other symbol y into — y for 
two more constituents then in the four constituents thus obtained change any 
other symbol x into — x for four new constituents and so on until the number 
of possible changes is exhausted 

ndly to find the coefficient of any constituent — if that constituent involves 
a as a factor change in the original function x into but if it involves — x 
as a factor change in the original function x into apply the same rule with 
reference to the symbols y z c the final calculated value of the function 
thus transformed will be the coefficient sought 

the sum of the constituents multiplied each by its respective coefficient 
will be the expansion required 

 it is worthy of observation that a function may be developed with 
reference to symbols which it does not explicitly contain thus if proceeding 
according to the rule we seek to develop the function — x with reference to 
the symbols x and y we have 


when x 

and 

y 

l 

the given function 

 

x 

 

y 

 

 

 

x 

 

y 

l 

 

 

x 

 

y 

 

 

 


whence the development is 

 — x xy ox — y — x y — x — y 

and this is a true development the addition of the terms — x y and — x — y 
produces the function — x 

the symbol thus developed according to the rule with respect to the 
symbol x gives 

x — x 

developed with respect to x and y it gives 

xy x y x y x y 

similarly developed with respect to any set of symbols it produces a series 
consisting of all possible constituents of those symbols 

 a few additional remarks concerning the nature of the general expansions 
may with propriety be added let us take for illustration the general theorem 
 which presents the type of development for functions of two logical symbols 

in the first place that theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and 
y are quantitative symbols of the species considered in this chapter whatever 
algebraic form may be assigned to the function x y and it may therefore be 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


intelligibly employed in any stage of the process of analysis intermediate between 
the change of interpretation of the symbols from the logical to the quantitative 
system above referred to and the final restoration of the logical interpretation 

secondly the theorem is perfectly true and intelligible when x and y are 
logical symbols provided that the form of the function a y is such as to 
represent a class or collection of things in which case the second member is 
always logically interpretable for instance if f x y represent the function 
 — x xy we obtain on applying the theorem 

 — x xy xy oa — y — x y — x — y 

 xylxylxly 

and this result is intelligible and true 

thus we may regard the theorem as true and intelligible for quantitative 
symbols of the species above described always for logical symbols always when 
interpretable whensoever therefore it is employed in this work it must be 
understood that the symbols x y are quantitative and of the particular species 
referred to if the expansion obtained is not interpret able 

but though the expansion is not always immediately interpretable it always 
conducts us at once to results which are interpretable thus the expression x — y 
gives on development the form 

xly 

which is not generally interpretable we cannot take in thought from the class 
of things which are x’s and not j’s the class of things which are y’ s and not a’s 
because the latter class is not contained in the former but if the form x — y 
presented itself as the first member of an equation of which the second member 
was we should have on development 

x l y y l x 

now it will be shown in the next chapter that the above equation x and y being 
regarded as quantitative and of the species described is resolvable at once into 
the two equations 

aiyo y i — o 

and these equations are directly interpretable in logic when logical interpre 
tations are assigned to the symbols x and y and it may be remarked that 
though functions do not necessarily become interpretable upon development 
yet equations are always reducible by this process to interpretable forms 

 the following proposition establishes some important properties of con 
stituents in its enunciation the symbol t is employed to represent indifferently 
any constituent of an expansion thus if the expansion is that of a function of 
two symbols x and y t represents any of the four forms xy x — y — x y 
and — x — y where it is necessary to represent the constituents of an 
expansion by single symbols and yet to distinguish them from each other the 
distinction will be marked by suffixes thus t might be employed to represent 
xy t to represent x — y and so on 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


proposition iii 

any single constituent t of an expansion satisfies the law of duality whose 
expression is 

tlt 

the product of any two distinct constituents of an expansion is equal to and 
the sum of all the constituents is equal to 

st consider the particular constituent xy we have 

xy x xy x y 

but x x y y by the fundamental law of class symbols hence 

xy xiy xy 


or representing xy by t 


t x t t 


or 

tlt 

similarly the constituent x — y satisfies the same law for we have 

x x y y 

• x y xly or t t 

now every factor of every constituent is either of the form x or of the form — x 
hence the square of each factor is equal to that factor and therefore the square 
of the product of the factors ie of the constituent is equal to the constituent 
wherefore t representing any constituent we have 

t t or t — t 

ndly the product of any two constituents is this is evident from the 
general law of the symbols expressed by the equation x — x for whatever 
constituents in the same expansion we take there will be at least one factor x 
in the one to which will correspond a factor — x in the other 

rdly the sum of all the constituents of an expansion is unity this is 
evident from addition of the two constituents x and — x or of the four con 
stituents xy xl — y — xy — xl — y but it is also and more generally 
proved by expanding in terms of any set of symbols v the constituents 
in this case are formed as usual and all the coefficients are unity 

 with the above proposition we may connect the following 


proposition iv 



chapter v principles of symbolic reasoning 


 


if v represent the sum of any series of constituents the separate coefficients 
of which are then is the condition satisfied 

v v 

let fi t t n be the constituents in question then 

v ti t • • ¦ t n 

squaring both sides and observing that t t tit c we have 

v t t ¦ ¦ ¦ t n 

whence 

v y 

therefore 

v v 



chapter vi 

of the general interpretation of logical 
equations and the resulting analysis of 
propositions also of the condition of 
interpretability of logical functions 


 it has been observed that the complete expansion of any function by the 
general rule demonstrated in the last chapter involves two distinct sets of ele 
ments viz the constituents of the expansion and their coefficients i propose 
in the present chapter to inquire first into the interpretation of constituents 
and afterwards into the mode in which that interpretation is modified by the 
coefficients with which they are connected 

the terms “logical equation” “logical function” c will be employed gen 
erally to denote any equation or function involving the symbols x y c which 
may present itself either in the expression of a system of premises or in the train 
of symbolical results which intervenes between the premises and the conclusion 
if that function or equation is in a form not immediately interpretable in logic 
the symbols x y c must be regarded as quantitative symbols of the species 
described in previous chapters ii v as satisfying the law 

x — x 

by the problem then of the interpretation of any such logical function or 
equation is meant the reduction of it to a form in which when logical values are 
assigned to the symbols x y c it shall become interpretable together with 
the resulting interpretation these conventional definitions are in accordance 
with the general principles for the conducting of the method of this treatise 
laid down in the previous chapter 

proposition i 

 the constituents of the expansion of any function of the logical symbols 
x y c are interpretable and represent the several exclusive divisions of the 
universe of discourse formed by the predication and denial in every possible way 
of the qualities denoted by the symbols x y c 


 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


for greater distinctness of conception let it be supposed that the function 
expanded involves two symbols x and y with reference to which the expansion 
has been effected we have then the following constituents viz 

xy xly x y x y 

of these it is evident that the first xy represents that class of objects which 
at the same time possess both the elementary qualities expressed by x and y 
and that the second x — y represents the class possessing the property x but 
not the property y in like manner the third constituent represents the class of 
objects which possess the property represented by y but not that represented 
by x and the fourth constituent — x — y represents that class of objects 
the members of which possess neither of the qualities in question 

thus the constituents in the case just considered represent all the four classes 
of objects which can be described by affirmation and denial of the properties 
expressed by x and y those classes are distinct from each other no member 
of one is a member of another for each class possesses some property or quality 
contrary to a property or quality possessed by any other class again these 
classes together make up the universe for there is no object which may not be 
described by the presence or the absence of a proposed quality and thus each 
individual thing in the universe may be referred to some one or other of the four 
classes made by the possible combination of the two given classes x and y and 
their contraries 

the remarks which have here been made with reference to the constituents 
of f xy are perfectly general in character the constituents of any expansion 
represent classes — those classes are mutually distinct through the possession of 
contrary qualities and they together make up the universe of discourse 

 these properties of constituents have their expression in the theorems 
demonstrated in the conclusion of the last chapter and might thence have been 
deduced from the fact that every constituent satisfies the fundamental law of 
the individual symbols it might have been conjectured that each constituent 
would represent a class from the fact that the product of any two constituents 
of an expansion vanishes it might have been concluded that the classes they 
represent are mutually exclusive lastly from the fact that the sum of the 
constituents of an expansion is unity it might have been inferred that the 
classes which they represent together make up the universe 

 upon the laws of constituents and the mode of their interpretation above 
determined are founded the analysis and the interpretation of logical equations 
that all such equations admit of interpretation by the theorem of development 
has already been stated i propose here to investigate the forms of possible 
solution which thus present themselves in the conclusion of a train of reasoning 
and to show how those forms arise although properly speaking they are but 
manifestations of a single fundamental type or principle of expression it will 
conduce to clearness of apprehension if the minor varieties which they exhibit 
are presented separately to the mind 

the forms which are three in number are as follows 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


form i 

 the form we shall first consider arises when any logical equation v 
is developed and the result after resolution into its component equations is 
to be interpreted the function is supposed to involve the logical symbols x y 
c in combinations which are not fractional fractional combinations indeed 
only arise in the class of problems which will be considered when we come to 
speak of the third of the forms of solution above referred to 

proposition ii 

to interpret the logical equation v 

for simplicity let us suppose that v involves but two symbols x and y and 
let us represent the development of the given equation by 

axy bx — y c — x y d — x — y 

a c and d being definite numerical constants 

now suppose that any coefficient as a does not vanish then multiplying 
each side of the equation by the constituent xy to which that coefficient is 
attached we have 

axy 

whence as a does not vanish 

xy 

and this result is quite independent of the nature of the other coefficients of the 
expansion its interpretation on assigning to x and y their logical significance 
is “no individuals belonging at once to the class represented by x and the class 
represented by y exist” 

but if the coefficient a does vanish the term axy does not appear in the 
development and therefore the equation xy cannot thence be deduced 

in like manner if the coefficient b does not vanish we have 

x l y o 

which admits of the interpretation “there are no individuals which at the same 
time belong to the class x and do not belong to the class y 

either of the above interpretations may however as will subsequently be 
shown be exhibited in a different form 

the sum of the distinct interpretations thus obtained from the several terms 
of the expansion whose coefficients do not vanish will constitute the complete 
interpretation of the equation v the analysis is essentially independent of 
the number of logical symbols involved in the function v and the object of the 
proposition will therefore in all instances be attained by the following rule 

rule — develop the function v and equate to every constituent whose 
coefficient does not vanish the interpretation of these results collectively will 
constitute the interpretation of the given equation 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


 let us take as an example the definition of “clean beasts” laid down in 
the jewish law viz “clean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and 
chew the cud” and let us assume 
x clean beasts 

y beasts dividing the hoof then the given proposition will be repre 
z beasts chewing the cud 
sented by the equation 

x yz 

which we shall reduce to the form 


x — yz 

and seek that form of interpretation to which the present method leads fully 
developing the first member we have 

oxyz xy — z x — y z x — y — z 
— — a yz — x y — z — x — y z — x — y — z 

whence the terms whose coefficients do not vanish give 

xy — z xz — y x — y — z — xyz 

these equations express a denial of the existence of certain classes of objects 
viz 

st of beasts which are clean and divide the hoof but do not chew the 
cud 

nd of beasts which are clean and chew the cud but do not divide the 
hoof 

rd of beasts which are clean and neither divide the hoof nor chew the 
cud 

th of beasts which divide the hoof and chew the cud and are not clean 

now all these several denials are really involved in the original proposition 
and conversely if these denials be granted the original proposition will follow as 
a necessary consequence they are in fact the separate elements of that propo 
sition every primary proposition can thus be resolved into a series of denials 
of the existence of certain defined classes of things and may from that system 
of denials be itself reconstructed it might here be asked how it is possible 
to make an assertive proposition out of a series of denials or negations from 
what source is the positive element derived i answer that the mind assumes 
the existence of a universe not a priori as a fact independent of experience 
but either a posteriori as a deduction from experience or hypothetically as a 
foundation of the possibility of assertive reasoning thus from the proposition 
“there are no men who are not fallible” which is a negation or denial of the 
existence of “infallible men” it may be inferred either hypothetically “all men 
if men exist are fallible” or absolutely experience having assured us of the 
existence of the race “all men are fallible” 

the form in which conclusions are exhibited by the method of this proposi 
tion may be termed the form of “single or conjoint denial” 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


form ii 

 as the previous form was derived from the development and interpre 
tation of an equation whose second member is the present form which is 
supplementary to it will be derived from the development and interpretation 
of an equation whose second member is it is however readily suggested by 
the analysis of the previous proposition 

thus in the example last discussed we deduced from the equation 

x — yz 

the conjoint denial of the existence of the classes represented by the constituents 

xylz xz — y xlylz xyz 

whose coefficients were not equal to it follows hence that the remaining 
constituents represent classes which make up the universe hence we shall have 

xyz x y z x y z a y z 

this is equivalent to the affirmation that all existing things belong to some one 
or other of the following classes viz 

st clean beasts both dividing the hoof and chewing the cud 

nd unclean beasts dividing the hoof but not chewing the cud 

rd unclean beasts chewing the cud but not dividing the hoof 

th things which are neither clean beasts nor chewers of the cud nor 
dividers of the hoof 

this form of conclusion may be termed the form of “single or disjunctive 
affirmation” — single when but one constituent appears in the final equation 
disjunctive when as above more constituents than one are there found 

any equation v wherein v satisfies the law of duality may also be 
made to yield this form of interpretation by reducing it to the form — v 
and developing the first member the case however is really included in the 
next general form both the previous forms are of slight importance compared 
with the following one 


form ill 

 in the two preceding cases the functions to be developed were equated to 
 and to respectively in the present case i shall suppose the corresponding 
function equated to any logical symbol w we are then to endeavour to interpret 
the equation v w v being a function of the logical symbols x y z c in 
the first place however i deem it necessary to show how the equation v w 
or as it will usually present itself w v arises 

let us resume the definition of “clean beasts” employed in the previous 
examples viz “clean beasts are those which both divide the hoof and chew 
the cud” and suppose it required to determine the relation in which “beasts 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


chewing the cud” stand to “clean beasts” and “beasts dividing the hoof” the 
equation expressing the given proposition is 


x yz 

and our object will be accomplished if we can determine as an interpretable 
function of x and y 

now treating x y z as symbols of quantity subject to a peculiar law we 
may deduce from the above equation by solution 

x 

z — 

v 

but this equation is not at present in an interpretable form if we can reduce 
it to such a form it will furnish the relation required 

on developing the second member of the above equation we have 

 xy y x y x y 

and it will be shown hereafter prop that this admits of the following 
interpretation 

“beasts which chew the cud consist of all clean beasts which also divide 
the hoof together with an indefinite remainder some none or all of unclean 
beasts which do not divide the hoof” 

 now the above is a particular example of a problem of the utmost gen 
erality in logic and which may thus be stated “given any logical equation 
connecting the symbols x y z w required an interpretable expression for the 
relation of the class represented by w to the classes represented by the other 
symbols x y z c” 

the solution of this problem consists in all cases in determining from the 
equation given the expression of the above symbol w in terms of the other 
symbols and rendering that expression interpretable by development now the 
equation given is always of the first degree with respect to each of the symbols 
involved the required expression for w can therefore always be found in fact 
if we develop the given equation whatever its form may be with respect to w 
we obtain an equation of the form 

ew elw 

e and e being functions of the remaining symbols from the above we have 

e e e w 


therefore 


w 


e 

e e 


 


and expanding the second member by the rule of development it will only 
remain to interpret the result in logic by the next proposition 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


if the fraction e e has common factors in its numerator and denominator 
we are not permitted to reject them unless they are mere numerical constants 
for the symbols x y c regarded as quantitative may admit of such values 
and as to cause the common factors to become equal to in which case the 
algebraic rule of reduction fails this is the case contemplated in our remarks on 
the failure of the algebraic axiom of division ii to express the solution in 
the form and without attempting to perform any unauthorized reductions 
to interpret the result by the theorem of development is a course strictly in 
accordance with the general principles of this treatise 

if the relation of the class expressed by — w to the other classes x y c 
is required we deduce from in like manner as above 


to the interpretation of which also the method of the following proposition is 
applicable 


proposition iii 

 to determine the interpretation of any logical equation of the form w 
v in which w is a class symbol and v a function of other class symbols quite 
unlimited in its form 

let the second member of the above equation be fully expanded each 
coefficient of the result will belong to some one of the four classes which with 
their respective interpretations we proceed to discuss 

st let the coefficient be as this is the symbol of the universe and 
as the product of any two class symbols represents those individuals which are 
found in both classes any constituent which has unity for its coefficient must 
be interpreted without limitation ie the whole of the class which it represents 
is implied 

nd let the coefficient be as in logic equally with arithmetic this is 
the symbol of nothing no part of the class represented by the constituent to 
which it is prefixed must be taken 

rd let the coefficient be of the form now as in arithmetic the symbol 
k represents an indefinite number except when otherwise determined by some 
special circumstance analogy would suggest that in the system of this work the 
same symbol should represent an indefinite class that this is its true meaning 
will be made clear from the following example 

let us take the proposition “men not mortal do not exist” represent this 
proposition by symbols and seek in obedience to the laws to which those 
symbols have been proved to be subject a reverse definition of “mortal beings” 
in terms of “men” 

now if we represent “men” by y and “mortal beings” by x the proposition 
“men who are not mortals do not exist” will be expressed by the equation 


 x 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


from which we are to seek the value of x now the above equation gives 

y — yx or yx y 

were this an ordinary algebraic equation we should in the next place divide 
both sides of it by y but it has been remarked in chap that the opera 
tion of division cannot be performed with the symbols with which we are now 
engaged our resource then is to express the operation and develop the result 
by the method of the preceding chapter we have then first 



and expanding the second member as directed 

 

x v i y ‘ 

this implies that mortals x consist of all men y together with such a re 
mainder of beings which are not men — y as be indicated by the coefficient 
ij now let us inquire what remainder of “not men” is implied by the premiss it 
might happen that the remainder included all the beings who are not men or it 
might include only some of them and not others or it might include none and 
any one of these assumptions would be in perfect accordance with our premiss 
in other words whether those beings which are not men are all or some or 
none of them mortal the truth of the premiss which virtually asserts that all 
men are mortal will be equally unaffected and therefore the expression here 
indicates that all some or none of the class to whose expression it is affixed 
must be taken 

although the above determination of the significance of the symbol is 
founded only upon the examination of a particular case yet the principle in 
volved in the demonstration is general and there are no circumstances under 
which the symbol can present itself to which the same mode of analysis is in 
applicable we may properly term an indefinite class symbol and may if 
convenience should require replace it by an uncompounded symbol v subject 
to the fundamental law ul — v 

th it may happen that the coefficient of a constituent in an expansion does 
not belong to any of the previous cases to ascertain its true interpretation when 
this happens it will be necessary to premise the following theorem 

 theorem — if a function v intended to represent any class or col 
lection of objects w be expanded and if the numerical coefficient a of any 
constituent in its development do not satisfy the law 

a — a 

then the constituent in question must be made equal to 

to prove the theorem generally let us represent the expansion given under 
the form 

w afii a t a t c 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


in which t t t c represent the constituents and a c the 
coefficients let us also suppose that ai and a do not satisfy the law 


ai ai a a 


but that the other coefficients are subject to the law in question so that we 
have 

a a c 

now multiply each side of the equation by itself the result will be 

w — citi t a t t c 

this is evident from the fact that it must represent the development of the 
equation 

wv 

but it may also be proved by actually squaring and observing that we have 
t ti t t ht c 


by the properties of constituents now subtracting from we have 
ai ai ti a a t 


or 


ai — ai t a — a t — 
multiply the last equation by t then since tt we have 

ai — ai t whence t 

in like manner multiplying the same equation by t we have 
a — a t whence t 


thus it may be shown generally that any constituent whose coefficient is 
not subject to the same fundamental law as the symbols themselves must be 
separately equated to the usual form under which such coefficients occur 
is this is the algebraic symbol of infinity now the nearer any number 
approaches to infinity allowing such an expression the more does it depart 
from the condition of satisfying the fundamental law above referred to 

the symbol j whose interpretation was previously discussed does not nec 
essarily disobey the law we are here considering for it admits of the numerical 
values and indifferently its actual interpretation however as an indefinite 
class symbol cannot i conceive except upon the ground of analogy be deduced 
from its arithmetical properties but must be established experimentally 

 we may now collect the results to which we have been led into the 
following summary 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


st the symbol as the coefficient of a term in a development indicates 
that the whole of the class which that constituent represents is to be taken 

nd the coefficient indicates that none of the class are to be taken 

rd the symbol indicates that a perfectly indefinite portion of the class 
ie some none or all of its members are to be taken 

th any other symbol as a coefficient indicates that the constituent to 
which it is prefixed must be equated to 

it follows hence that if the solution of a problem obtained by development 
be of the form 

w a ob — c — d 

that solution may be resolved into the two following equations viz 

w a vc 

d 

v being an indefinite class symbol the interpretation of shows what ele 
ments enter or may enter into the composition of w the class of things whose 
definition is required and the interpretation of shows what relations exist 
among the elements of the original problem in perfect independence of w 

such are the canons of interpretation it may be added that they are univer 
sal in their application and that their use is always unembarrassed by exception 
or failure 

 corollary if v be an independently interpretable logical function it 
will satisfy the symbolical law v — v 

by an independently interpretable logical function i mean one which is 
interpretable without presupposing any relation among the things represented 
by the symbols which it involves thus xl — y is independently interpretable 
but x — y is not so the latter function presupposes as a condition of its 
interpretation that the class represented by y is wholly contained in the class 
represented by x the former function does not imply any such requirement 

now if v be independently interpretable and if w represent the collection 
of individuals which it contains the equation w v will hold true without 
entailing as a consequence the vanishing of any of the constituents in the devel 
opment of v since such vanishing of constituents would imply relations among 
the classes of things denoted by the symbols in v hence the development of v 
will be of the form 

aiti a c 

the coefficients a a c all satisfying the condition 

ail — aq a l — a c 

hence by the reasoning of prop chap v the function v will be subject 
to the law 

v v 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


this result though evident a priori from the fact that v is supposed to 
represent a class or collection of things is thus seen to follow also from the 
properties of the constituents of which it is composed the condition vl — v 
 may be termed “the condition of interpret ability of logical functions” 

 the general form of solutions or logical conclusions developed in the 
last proposition may be designated as a “relation between terms” i use as 
before the word “terms” to denote the parts of a proposition whether simple 
or complex which are connected by the copula “is” or “are” the classes of 
things represented by the individual symbols may be called the elements of the 
proposition 

 ex resuming the definition of “clean beasts” vi required a 
description of “unclean beasts” 

here as before x standing for “ clean beasts” y for “beasts dividing the 
hoof” z for “beasts chewing the cud” we have 


x yz 


 


whence 

 — x — yz 

and developing the second member 

 x yl z zl y yl z 

which is interpretable into the following proposition unclean beasts are all 
which divide the hoof without chewing the cud all which chew the cud without 
dividing the hoof and all which neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud 

ex the same definition being given required a description of beasts 
which do not divide the hoof 

from the equation x yz we have 

x 

v z 

therefore 


and developing the second member 

 — y xz h — — al — z — x z q — — z ¦ 

s here according to the rule the term whose coefficients is must be sepa 
rately equated to whence we have 

 — y — xz vl — ® — z 
xl — z 

whereof the first equation gives by interpretation the proposition beasts which 
do not divide the hoof consist of all unclean beasts which chew the cud and an 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


indefinite remainder some none or all of unclean beasts which do not chew 
the cud 

the second equation gives the proposition there are no clean beasts which 
do not chew the cud this is one of the independent relations above referred to 
we sought the direct relation of “beasts not dividing the hoof” to “clean beasts 
and beasts which chew the cud” it happens however that independently of 
any relation to beasts not dividing the hoof there exists in virtue of the premiss 
a separate relation between clean beasts and beasts which chew the cud this 
relation is also necessarily given by the process 

ex let us take the following definition viz “responsible beings are all 
rational beings who are either free to act or have voluntarily sacrificed their 
freedom” and apply to it the preceding analysis 

let x stand for responsible beings 
y ” rational beings 

z ” those who are free to act 

w ” those who have voluntarily sacrificed their 

freedom of action 

in the expression of this definition i shall assume that the two alternatives 
which it presents viz “rational beings free to act” and “rational beings 
whose freedom of action has been voluntarily sacrificed” are mutually exclusive 
so that no individuals are found at once in both these divisions this will permit 
us to interpret the proposition literally into the language of symbols as follows 

x yz yw 

let us first determine hence the relation of “rational beings” to responsible 
beings beings free to act and beings whose freedom of action has been voluntar 
ily abjured perhaps this object will be better stated by saying that we desire 
to express the relation among the elements of the premiss in such a form as will 
enable us to determine how far rationality may be inferred from responsibility 
freedom of action a voluntary sacrifice of freedom and their contraries 

from we have 

x 

y na — v 

z w 

and developing the second member but rejecting terms whose coefficients 
are 


y xzw xz — w xl — zw — z — w 


whence equating to the terms whose coefficients are i and i we have 

y xz — w xw — z vl — al — z — w 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


xzw 

 

zl w 

 


whence by interpretation — 

direct conclusion — rational beings are all responsible beings who are 
either free to act not having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom or not free 
to act having voluntarily sacrificed their freedom together with an indefinite 
remainder some none or all of beings not responsible not free and not having 
voluntarily sacrificed their freedom 

first independent relation — no responsible beings are at the same 
time free to act and in the condition of having voluntarily sacrificed their free 
dom 

second no responsible beings are not free to act and at the same time in 
the condition of not having sacrificed their freedom 

the independent relations above determined may however be put in another 
and more convenient form thus gives 

xw oz — z on development 

 

or 

xw il — z 

and in like manner gives 

xl w — jz z 

 — z 

or 

xl — w vz 

and and interpreted give the following propositions 

st responsible beings who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not 
free 

nd responsible beings who have not voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are 
free 

these however are merely different forms of the relations before determined 

 in examining these results the reader must bear in mind that the sole 
province of a method of inference or analysis is to determine those relations 
which are necessitated by the connexion of the terms in the original propo 
sition accordingly in estimating the completeness with which this object is 
effected we have nothing whatever to do with those other relations which may 
be suggested to our minds by the meaning of the terms employed as distinct 
from their expressed connexion thus it seems obvious to remark that “they 
who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free” this being a relation 
implied in the very meaning of the terms and hence it might appear that 
the first of the two independent relations assigned by the method is on the one 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


hand needlessly limited and on the other hand superfluous however if regard 
be had merely to the connexion of the terms in the original premiss it will be 
seen that the relation in question is not liable to either of these charges the 
solution as expressed in the direct conclusion and the independent relations 
conjointly is perfectly complete without being in any way superfluous 

if we wish to take into account the implicit relation above referred to viz 
“they who have voluntarily sacrificed their freedom are not free” we can do so 
by making this a distinct proposition the proper expression of which would be 

w vl — z 

this equation we should have to employ together with that expressive of the 
original premiss the mode in which such an examination must be conducted 
will appear when we enter upon the theory of systems of propositions in a future 
chapter the sole difference of result to which the analysis leads is that the 
first of the independent relations deduced above is superseded 

 ex assuming the same definition as in example let it be required 
to obtain a description of irrational persons 

we have 


z w — x 
z w 

 xzw oxzl — w oxl — zw — xl — z — w 

 — xzw — xz — iv — xl — zw — xl — z — w 

 — xzw — xz — iv — xl — zw ul — xl — z — w 

 — xz — xl — zw vl — xl — z — w 

with xzw xl — zl — w 

the independent relations here given are the same as we before arrived at 
as they evidently ought to be since whatever relations prevail independently 
of the existence of a given class of objects y prevail independently also of the 
existence of the contrary class — y 

the direct solution afforded by the first equation is irrational persons con 
sist of all irresponsible beings who are either free to act or have voluntarily 
sacrificed their liberty and are not free to act together with an indefinite re 
mainder of irresponsible beings who have not sacrificed their liberty and are not 
free to act 

 the propositions analyzed in this chapter have been of that species 
called definitions i have discussed none of which the second or predicate term 
is particular and of which the general type is y vx y and x being functions 
of the logical symbols x y z c and v an indefinite class symbol the analysis 



chapter vi of interpretation 


 


of such propositions is greatly facilitated though the step is not an essential one 
by the elimination of the symbol v and this process depends upon the method 
of the next chapter i postpone also the consideration of another important 
problem necessary to complete the theory of single propositions but of which 
the analysis really depends upon the method of the reduction of systems of 
propositions to be developed in a future page of this work 



chapter vii 


on elimination 


 in the examples discussed in the last chapter all the elements of the original 
premiss reappeared in the conclusion only in a different order and with a 
different connexion but it more usually happens in common reasoning and 
especially when we have more than one premiss that some of the elements 
are required not to appear in the conclusion such elements or as they are 
commonly called “middle terms” may be considered as introduced into the 
original propositions only for the sake of that connexion which they assist to 
establish among the other elements which are alone designed to enter into the 
expression of the conclusion 

 respecting such intermediate elements or middle terms some erroneous 
notions prevail it is a general opinion to which however the examples con 
tained in the last chapter furnish a contradiction that inference consists pe 
culiarly in the elimination of such terms and that the elementary type of this 
process is exhibited in the elimination of one middle term from two premises so 
as to produce a single resulting conclusion into which that term does not enter 
hence it is commonly held that syllogism is the basis or else the common type 
of all inference which may thus however complex its form and structure be 
resolved into a series of syllogisms the propriety of this view will be considered 
in a subsequent chapter at present i wish to direct attention to an important 
but hitherto unnoticed point of difference between the system of logic as ex 
pressed by symbols and that of common algebra with reference to the subject 
of elimination in the algebraic system we are able to eliminate one symbol from 
two equations two symbols from three equations and generally n — symbols 
from n equations there thus exists a definite connexion between the number of 
independent equations given and the number of symbols of quantity which it is 
possible to eliminate from them but it is otherwise with the system of logic 
no fixed connexion there prevails between the number of equations given rep 
resenting propositions or premises and the number of typical symbols of which 
the elimination can be effected from a single equation an indefinite number of 
such symbols may be eliminated on the other hand from an indefinite number 
of equations a single class symbol only may be eliminated we may affirm 
that in this peculiar system the problem of elimination is resolvable under all 


 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


circumstances alike this is a consequence of that remarkable law of duality 
to which the symbols of logic are subject to the equations furnished by the 
premises given there is added another equation or system of equations drawn 
from the fundamental laws of thought itself and supplying the necessary means 
for the solution of the problem in question of the many consequences which 
flow from the law of duality this is perhaps the most deserving of attention 

 as in algebra it often happens that the elimination of symbols from a 
given system of equations conducts to a mere identity in the form no 
independent relations connecting the symbols which remain so in the system 
of logic a like result admitting of a similar interpretation may present itself 
such a circumstance does not detract from the generality of the principle before 
stated the object of the method upon which we are about to enter is to 
eliminate any number of symbols from any number of logical equations and to 
exhibit in the result the actual relations which remain now it may be that no 
such residual relations exist in such a case the truth of the method is shown 
by its leading us to a merely identical proposition 

 the notation adopted in the following propositions is similar to that of 
the last chapter by fx is meant any expression involving the logical symbol 
x with or without other logical symbols by is meant what fx becomes 
when x is therein changed into by what the same function becomes when 
x is changed into 


proposition i 

 if fx be any logical equation involving the class symbol x with or 
without other class symbols then will the equation 

 

be true independently of the interpretation of x and it will be the complete 
result of the elimination of x from the above equation 

in other words the elimination of x from any given equation fx will 
be effected by successively changing in that equation x into and x into and 
multiplying the two resulting equations together 

similarly the complete result of the elimination of any class symbols x 
y etc from any equation of the form v will be obtained by completely 
expanding the first member of that equation in constituents of the given symbols 
and multiplying together all the coefficients of those constituents and equating 
the product to 

developing the first member of the equation fx we have v 


 ® x 
or ar x i 

l 

m a 


and — x — 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


substitute these expressions for x and — x in the fundamental equation 

xl — x 

and there results 

qi n 
 l ’ 

or l 


the form required 

 it is seen in this process that the elimination is really effected between 
the given equation fix and the universally true equation xl — x 
expressing the fundamental law of logical symbols qua logical there exists 
therefore no need of more than one premiss or equation in order to render pos 
sible the elimination of a term the necessary law of thought virtually supplying 
the other premiss or equation and though the demonstration of this conclusion 
may be exhibited in other forms yet the same element furnished by the mind 
itself will still be virtually present thus we might proceed as follows 

multiply by x and we have 

 

and let us seek by the forms of ordinary algebra to eliminate x from this equation 
and 

now if we have two algebraic equations of the form 

ax b 
ax b 

it is well known that the result of the elimination of x is 

ah — ab 

but comparing the above pair of equations with and respectively we 
find 

a l — b 
a f b 

which substituted in give 

l 

as before in this form of the demonstration the fundamental equation xl — 
x makes its appearance in the derivation of from 

 i shall add yet another form of the demonstration partaking of a half log 
ical character and which may set the demonstration of this important theorem 
in a clearer light 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


we have as before 

l l 

multiply this equation first by x and secondly by — x we get 

 — x 

from these we have by solution and development 


 


 

x 


 

 


 


on development 


 


 

 — x 


o a 


the direct interpretation of these equations is— 

st whatever individuals are included in the class represented by are 
not ads 

nd whatever individuals are included in the class represented by are 

ads 

whence by common logic there are no individuals at once in the class 
and in the class ie there are no individuals in the class l hence 


l 


 


or it would suffice to multiply together the developed equations whence the 
result would immediately follow 

 the theorem furnishes us with the following rule 

to eliminate any symbol from a proposed equation 

ruletie terms of the equation having been brought by transposition if 
necessary to the first side give to the symbol successively the values and 
and multiply the resulting equations together 

the first part of the proposition is now proved 

 consider in the next place the general equation 

fxy 


the first member of which represents any function of x y and other symbols 

by what has been shown the result of the elimination of y from this equation 
will be 

fxlfx 

for such is the form to which we are conducted by successively changing in the 
given equation y into and y into and multiplying the results together 

again if in the result obtained we change successively x into and x into 
 and multiply the results together we have 


l l 


 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


as the final result of elimination but the four factors of the first member of this 
equation are the four coefficients of the complete expansion of fxy the first 
member of the original equation whence the second part of the proposition is 
manifest 


examples 

 ex having given the proposition “all men are mortal” and its 
symbolical expression in the equation 


v vx 

in which y represents “men” and x “mortals” it is required to eliminate the 
indefinite class symbol v and to interpret the result 

here bringing the terms to the first side we have 


when v this becomes 

and when v it becomes 


¦y — vx 
yx 


y 

and these two equations multiplied together give 

y yx 


or yl — x 

it being observed that y y 

the above equation is the required result of elimination and its interpreta 
tion is men who are not mortal do not exist an obvious conclusion 

if from the equation last obtained we seek a description of beings who are 
not mortal we have 


 x du — 

v 

whence by expansion — x — y which interpreted gives they who 
are not mortal are not men this is an example of what in the common logic is 
called conversion by contraposition or negative conversion 

ex taking the proposition “no men are perfect” as represented by the 
equation 

v v x 

whately’s logic book ii chap ii sec 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


wherein y represents “men” and x “perfect beings” it is required to eliminate 
v and find from the result a description both of perfect beings and of imperfect 
beings we have 

y — il — a 

whence by the rule of elimination 

ylxxy 


or 

yy lx o 

or 

yx 

which is interpreted by the proposition perfect men do not exist from the 
above equation we have 

x — y by development 

y 

whence by interpretation no perfect beings are men similarly 

 y „ 

lxl y y 

y y 

which on interpretation gives imperfect beings are all men with an indefinite 
remainder of beings which are not men 

 it will generally be the most convenient course in the treatment of 
propositions to eliminate first the indefinite class symbol v wherever it occurs 
in the corresponding equations this will only modify their form without im 
pairing their significance let us apply this process to one of the examples of 
chap iv for the proposition “no men are placed in exalted stations and free 
from envious regards” we found the expression 

y ui xz 

and for the equivalent proposition “men in exalted stations are not free from 
envious regards” the expression 

yx vl z 

and it was observed that these equations v being an indefinite class symbol 
were themselves equivalent to prove this it is only necessary to eliminate from 
each the symbol v the first equation is 

y — vl — xz 

whence first making v and then v and multiplying the results we 
have 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


yl xzy 
or yxz 

now the second of the given equations becomes on transposition 

¦yx — vl — z — 
whence x — zyx 
or yxz 

as before the reader will easily interpret the result 

 ex as a subject for the general method of this chapter we will 
resume mr senior’s definition of wealth viz “wealth consists of things trans 
ferable limited in supply and either productive of pleasure or preventive of 
pain” we shall consider this definition agreeably to a former remark as in 
cluding all things which possess at once both the qualities expressed in the last 
part of the definition upon which assumption we have as our representative 
equation 

w stpr pl — r rl — p 
or w stp rl — p 

wherein 

w stands for wealth 

s ” things limited in supply 

t ” things transferable 

p ” things productive of pleasure 

r ” things preventive of pain 

from the above equation we can eliminate any symbols that we do not 
desire to take into account and express the result by solution and development 
according to any proposed arrangement of subject and predicate 

let us first consider what the expression for w wealth would be if the 
element r referring to prevention of pain were eliminated now bringing the 
terms of the equation to the first side we get 

w — stp r — rp 

making r the first member becomes w—st and making r it becomes 
w — stp whence we have by the rule 

w — stw — stp 

or 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


whence 


w — wstp — wst stp 


 


stp 

w 

st stp — 

the development of the second member of which equation gives 


w 


stp stlp 


 


whence we have the conclusion wealth consists of all things limited in sup 
ply transferable and productive of pleasure and an indefinite remainder of 
things limited in supply transferable and not productive of pleasure this is 
sufficiently obvious 

let it be remarked that it is not necessary to perform the multiplication 
indicated in and reduce that equation to the form in order to determine 
the expression of w in terms of the other symbols the process of development 
may in all cases be made to supersede that of multiplication thus if we develop 
 in terms of w we find 


 — sf — stpw stp — w 

whence 


stp 

vj — 

stp — — stl — stp ’ 

and this equation developed will give as before 

 

w stp stl — p 

 suppose next that we seek a description of things limited in supply 
as dependent upon their relation to wealth transferableness and tendency to 
produce pleasure omitting all reference to the prevention of pain 

from equation which is the result of the elimination of r from the original 
equation we have 

w — s ¦ wt wtp — tp

chapter vii of elimination 


 


we will first give the direct interpretation of the above solution term by term 
afterwards we shall offer some general remarks which it suggests and finally 
show how the expression of the conclusion may be somewhat abbreviated 

first then the direct interpretation is things limited in supply consist of 
all wealth transferable and productive of pleasureall wealth transferable and not 
productive of pleasure an indefinite amount of what is not wealth but is either 
transferable and not productive of pleasure or intransferable and productive of 
pleasure or neither transferable nor productive of pleasure 

to which the terms whose coefficients are g permit us to add the following 
independent relations viz 

st wealth that is intransferable and productive of pleasure does not exist 

ndly wealth that is intransferable and not productive of pleasure does not 
exist 

 respecting this solution i suppose the following remarks are likely to be 
made 

first it may be said that in the expression above obtained for “things 
limited in supply” the term “all wealth transferable” c is in part redundant 
since all wealth is as implied in the original proposition and directly asserted 
in the independent relations necessarily transferable 

i answer that although in ordinary speech we should not deem it necessary to 
add to “wealth” the epithet “transferable” if another part of our reasoning had 
led us to express the conclusion that there is no wealth which is not transferable 
yet it pertains to the perfection of this method that it in all cases fully defines the 
objects represented by each term of the conclusion by stating the relation they 
bear to each quality or element of distinction that we have chosen to employ 
this is necessary in order to keep the different parts of the solution really distinct 
and independent and actually prevents redundancy suppose that the pair of 
terms we have been considering had not contained the word “transferable” 
and had unitedly been “all wealth” we could then logically resolve the single 
term “all wealth” into the two terms “all wealth transferable” and “all wealth 
intransferable” but the latter term is shown to disappear by the “independent 
relations” hence it forms no part of the description required and is therefore 
redundant the remaining term agrees with the conclusion actually obtained 

solutions in which there cannot by logical divisions be produced any super 
fluous or redundant terms may be termed pure solutions such are all the solu 
tions obtained by the method of development and elimination above explained 
it is proper to notice that if the common algebraic method of elimination were 
adopted in the cases in which that method is possible in the present system 
we should not be able to depend upon the purity of the solutions obtained its 
want of generality would not be its only defect 

 in the second place it will be remarked that the conclusion contains 
two terms the aggregate significance of which would be more conveniently ex 
pressed by a single term instead of “all wealth productive of pleasure and 
transferable” and “all wealth not productive of pleasure and transferable” we 
might simply say “all wealth transferable” this remark is quite just but it 
must be noticed that whenever any such simplifications are possible they are

immediately suggested by the form of the equation we have to interpret and if 
that equation be reduced to its simplest form then the interpretation to which 
it conducts will be in its simplest form also thus in the original solution the 
terms wtp and wtl — p which have unity for their coefficient give on addition 
wt the terms w — t p and w — t — p which have f for their coefficient 
give w — t and the terms — w — t p and — w — t — p which 
have for their coefficient give — w — t whence the complete solution 
is 

s wt jj w t jj i w t p 
with the independent relation 

 

w — t or w t 

the interpretation would now stand thus 

lst things limited in supply consist of all wealth transferable with an indef 
inite remainder of what is not wealth and not transferable and of transferable 
articles which are not wealth and are not productive of pleasure 

nd all wealth is transferable 

this is the simplest form under which the general conclusion with its atten 
dant condition can be put 

 when it is required to eliminate two or more symbols from a proposed 
equation we can either employ prop i or eliminate them in succession the 
order of the process being indifferent from the equation 

w st p r — pr 

we have eliminated r and found the result 

w — wst — wstp stp 

suppose that it had been required to eliminate both r and t then taking the 
above as the first step of the process it remains to eliminate from the last 
equation t now when t the first member of that equation becomes 

w — ws — wsp sp 

and when t the same member becomes w whence we have 

w w — ws — wsp sp 


or 

w — ws 

for the required result of elimination 

if from the last result we determine w we have 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


 

w i n s ’ 

 — s 

whence “ all wealth is limited in supply ” as p does not enter into the equa 
tion it is evident that the above is true irrespectively of any relation which the 
elements of the conclusion bear to the quality “productive of pleasure” 

resuming the original equation let it be required to eliminate s and t we 
have 


w stp r — pr 

instead however of separately eliminating s and t according to the rule it 
will suffice to treat st as a single symbol seeing that it satisfies the fundamental 
law of the symbols by the equation 

sfl — st 

placing therefore the given equation under the form 
w — stp r — pr 

and making st successively equal to and to and taking the product of 
the results we have 


w — p — r prw 
or w — wp — wr wpr 

for the result sought 

as a particular illustration let it be required to deduce an expression for 
“things productive of pleasure” p in terms of “wealth” w and “things pre 
ventive of pain” r 

we have on solving the equation 


w — r 

v a — 

¦ul — r 

 —wr wl — r h — — wr — ul — r 

„ k 

 ul — r wr — w 

whence the following conclusion things productive of pleasure are all wealth 
not preventive of pain an indefinite amount of wealth that is preventive of pain 
and an indefinite amount of what is not wealth 

from the same equation we get 


wl — r 

ul — r wl — r ’ 


 — p 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


which developed gives 


ul — p —wr — wr — to • — r 

 

 wr te 

whence things not productive of pleasure are either wealth preventive of 
pain or what is not wealth 

equally easy would be the discussion of any similar case 

 in the last example of elimination we have eliminated the compound 
symbol st from the given equation by treating it as a single symbol the 
same method is applicable to any combination of symbols which satisfies the 
fundamental law of individual symbols thus the expression p r — pr will on 
being multiplied by itself reproduce itself so that if we represent p r — pr by 
a single symbol as y we shall have the fundamental law obeyed the equation 

y y or y 

being satisfied for the rule of elimination for symbols is founded upon the 
supposition that each individual symbol is subject to that law and hence the 
elimination of any function or combination of such symbols from an equation 
may be effected by a single operation whenever that law is satisfied by the 
function 

though the forms of interpretation adopted in this and the previous chapter 
show perhaps better than any others the direct significance of the symbols 
and g modes of expression more agreeable to those of common discourse may 
with equal truth and propriety be employed thus the equation may be 
interpreted in the following manner wealth is either limited in supply trans 
ferable and productive of pleasure or limited in supply transferable and not 
productive of pleasure and reversely whatever is limited in supply transfer 
able and productive of pleasure is wealth reverse interpretations similar to 
the above are always furnished when the final development introduces terms 
having unity as a coefficient 

 notethe fundamental equation l expressing the result 
of the elimination of the symbol x from any equation fx admits of a 
remarkable interpretation 

it is to be remembered that by the equation fx is implied some 
proposition in which the individuals represented by the class x suppose “men” 
are referred to together it may be with other individuals and it is our object 
to ascertain whether there is implied in the proposition any relation among 
the other individuals independently of those found in the class men now 
the equation expresses what the original proposition would become 
if men made up the universe and the equation expresses what that 
original proposition would become if men ceased to exist wherefore the equation 
l expresses what in virtue of the original proposition would be 



chapter vii of elimination 


 


equally true on either assumption i e equally true whether “men” were “all 
things” or “nothing” wherefore the theorem expresses that what is equally 
true whether a given class of objects embraces the whole universe or disappears 
from existence is independent of that class altogether and vice versa herein we 
see another example of the interpretation of formal results immediately deduced 
from the mathematical laws of thought into general axioms of philosophy 



chapter viii 

on the reduction of systems of 
propositions 


 in the preceding chapters we have determined sufficiently for the most es 
sential purposes the theory of single primary propositions or to speak more 
accurately of primary propositions expressed by a single equation and we 
have established upon that theory an adequate method we have shown how 
any element involved in the given system of equations may be eliminated and 
the relation which connects the remaining elements deduced in any proposed 
form whether of denial of affirmation or of the more usual relation of subject 
and predicate it remains that we proceed to the consideration of systems of 
propositions and institute with respect to them a similar series of investiga 
tions we are to inquire whether it is possible from the equations by which 
a system of propositions is expressed to eliminate ad libitum any number of 
the symbols involved to deduce by interpretation of the result the whole of the 
relations implied among the remaining symbols and to determine in particu 
lar the expression of any single element or of any interpretable combination 
of elements in terms of the other elements so as to present the conclusion in 
any admissible form that may be required these questions will be answered 
by showing that it is possible to reduce any system of equations or any of the 
equations involved in a system to an equivalent single equation to which the 
methods of the previous chapters may be immediately applied it will be seen 
also that in this reduction is involved an important extension of the theory 
of single propositions which in the previous discussion of the subject we were 
compelled to forego this circumstance is not peculiar in its nature there are 
many special departments of science which cannot be completely surveyed from 
within but require to be studied also from an external point of view and to be 
regarded in connexion with other and kindred subjects in order that their full 
proportions be understood 

this chapter will exhibit two distinct modes of reducing systems of equations 
to equivalent single equations the first of these rests upon the employment of 
arbitrary constant multipliers it is a method sufficiently simple in theory but it 
has the inconvenience of rendering the subsequent processes of elimination and 
development when they occur somewhat tedious it was however the method 


 



chapter viii of reduction 


of reduction first discovered and partly on this account and partly on account 
of its simplicity it has been thought proper to retain it the second method 
does not require the introduction of arbitrary constants and is in nearly all 
respects preferable to the preceding one it will therefore generally be adopted 
in the subsequent investigations of this work 

 we proceed to the consideration of the first method 

proposition i 

any system of logical equations may be reduced to a single equivalent equa 
tion by multiplying each equation after the first by a distinct arbitrary constant 
quantity and adding all the results including the first equation together 

by prop chap vi the interpretation of any single equation fx y 
is obtained by equating to those constituents of the development of the first 
member whose coefficients do not vanish and hence if there be given two 
equations fx y and fx y their united import will be contained 
in the system of results formed by equating to all those constituents which 
thus present themselves in both or in either of the given equations developed 
according to the rule of chap vi thus let it be supposed that we have the 
two equations 


xy — x 

 

xy 

 


the development of the first gives 


 xy xl y 

whence xy xl — y 

the development of the second equation gives 

xl y x 

whence x — y y — x 

the constituents whose coefficients do not vanish in both developments are xy 
xl — y and — xy and these would together give the system 

xy rl y l xy 

which is equivalent to the two systems given by the developments separately 
seeing that in those systems the equation x — y is repeated confining 
ourselves to the case of binary systems of equations it remains then to determine 
a single equation which on development shall yield the same constituents with 
coefficients which do not vanish as the given equations produce now if we 
represent by 


vi v 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


the given equations v and v being functions of the logical symbols xyz 
c then the single equation 


v ch 

c being an arbitrary constant quantity will accomplish the required object for 
let at represent any term in the full development v wherein t is a constituent 
and a its numerical coefficient and let bt represent the corresponding term in 
the full development of v then will the corresponding term in the development 
of be 

a cbt 

the coefficient of t vanishes if a and b both vanish but not otherwise for if 
we assume that a and b do not both vanish and at the same time make 

a cb 

the following cases alone can present themselves 

st that a vanishes and b does not vanish in this case the above equation 
becomes 

cb 

and requires that c but this contradicts the hypothesis that c is an 
arbitrary constant 

nd that b vanishes and a does not vanish this assumption reduces 
to 

a 

by which the assumption is itself violated 

rd that neither a nor b vanishes the equation then gives 

a 



which is a definite value and therefore conflicts with the hypothesis that c is 
arbitrary 

hence the coefficient a cb vanishes when a and b both vanish but not 
otherwise therefore the same constituents will appear in the development of 
 with coefficients which do not vanish as in the equations vj v 
singly or together and the equation vi cv will be equivalent to the 
system v v 

by similar reasoning it appears that the general system of equations 
hi h v c 
may be replaced by the single equation 

hich c h c 

c d c being arbitrary constants the equation thus formed may be treated 
in all respects as the ordinary logical equations of the previous chapters the 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


arbitrary constants cic c are not logical symbols they do not satisfy the 
law 

cil ci c l c 

but their introduction is justified by that general principle which has been stated 
in ii and v and exemplified in nearly all our subsequent investigations 
viz that equations involving the symbols of logic may be treated in all respects 
as if those symbols were symbols of quantity subject to the special law xl— x 
 until in the final stage of solution they assume a form interpretable in that 
system of thought with which logic is conversant 

 the following example will serve to illustrate the above method 

ex suppose that an analysis of the properties of a particular class of 
substances has led to the following general conclusions viz 

st that wherever the properties a and b are combined either the property 
c or the property d is present also but they are not jointly present 

nd that wherever the properties b and c are combined the properties a 
and d are either both present with them or both absent 

rd that wherever the properties a and b are both absent the properties 
c and d are both absent also and vice versa where the properties c and d 
are both absent a and b are both absent also 

let it then be required from the above to determine what may be concluded 
in any particular instance from the presence of the property a with respect to 
the presence or absence of the properties b and c paying no regard to the 
property d 

represent the property a by x 

the property b by y 
the property c by z 
the property d by w 

then the symbolical expression of the premises will be 


xy— vwl— zzl— w yz xxul— xl— re — xl— y — zl— w 

from the first two of these equations separately eliminating the indefinite 
class symbol v we have 

xy — wl — z — z — w 

¦yz — xw — — xl — w 

now if we observe that by development 

 — w — z — z — w wz — ul — z 

and 

 — xw — — xl — w xl — w wl — x 
and in these expressions replace for simplicity 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


 xbyx ybyy c 

we shall have from the three last equations 


xywz wz 

 

yzxw xw 

 

x y wz 

and from this system we must eliminate w 

 


multiplying the second of the above equations by c and the third by d and 
adding the results to the first we have 

xywz wz cyzxw xw cxy — wz 

when w is made equal to and therefore w to the first member of the 
above equation becomes 


xyz cxyz cxy 

and when in the same member w is made and w it becomes 


xyz cxyz cxy — d z 

hence the result of the elimination of w may be expressed in the form 


 xyz cxyz cxy xyz cxyz cxy — d z 

and from this equation x is to be determined 

were we now to proceed as in former instances we should multiply together 
the factors in the first member of the above equation but it may be well to 
show that such a course is not at all necessary let us develop the first member 
of with reference to x the symbol whose expression is sought we find 


yzyz cyz — c’zx cyz dydy — c z — x 
or cyzx cyz dydy — dz — x 

whence we find 


cyz dy dy d z 

x 

cyz dy dy — dz — cyz ’ 

and developing the second member with respect to y and z 

n c 

x oyz yz yz yz 

or 

x y z z y z 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


or 

x y z jj z 

the interpretation of which is wherever the property a is present there either 
c is present and b absent or c is absent and inversely wherever the property 
c is present and the property b absent there the property a is present 

these results may be much more readily obtained by the method next to 
be explained it is however satisfactory to possess different modes serving for 
mutual verification of arriving at the same conclusion 

 we proceed to the second method 

proposition ii 

if any equations v v c are such that the developments of 
their first members consist only of constituents with positive coefficients those 
equations may be combined together into a single equivalent equation by addition 

for as before let at represent any term in the development of the function 
vi bt the corresponding term in the development of v and so on then will 
the corresponding term in the development of the equation 


vl v c 

formed by the addition of the several given equations be 

a b c t 

but as by hypothesis the coefficients a b c are none of them negative 
the aggregate coefficient a b c in the derived equation will only vanish 
when the separate coefficients a b c vanish together hence the same 
constituents will appear in the development of the equation as in the several 
equations v v c of the original system taken collectively and 
therefore the interpretation of the equation will be equivalent to the collective 
interpretations of the several equations from which it is derived 

proposition iii 

 if vi v c represent any system of equations the terms of 
which have by transposition been brought to like first side then the combined 
interpretation of the system will be involved in the single equation 

vi v c 

formed by adding together the squares of the given equations 

for let any equation of the system as vi produce on development an 
equation 


at a t c 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


in which tit zc are constituents and aia c their corresponding co 
efficients then the equation vj will produce on development an equation 


cqti t a t a vc — 

as may be proved either from the law of the development or by squaring the 
function ahi a t c in subjection to the conditions 

t t t t tt 

assigned in prop chap v hence the constituents which appear in 
the expansion of the equation vj are the same with those which appear 
in the expansion of the equation vj and they have positive coefficients 
and the same remark applies to the equations v c whence by the last 
proposition the equation 


vj v c 

will be equivalent in interpretation to the system of equations 

vj v c 

corollary any equation v of which the first member already satisfies 
the condition 


v v or v v 

does not need as it would remain unaffected by the process of squar 
ing such equations are indeed immediately developable into a series of con 
stituents with coefficients equal to chap v prop 

proposition iv 

 whenever the equations of a system have by the above process of squaring 
or by any other process been reduced to a form such that all the constituents 
exhibited in their development have positive coefficients any derived equations 
obtained by elimination will possess the same character and may be combined 
with the other equations by addition 

suppose that we have to eliminate a symbol x from any equation v 
which is such that none of the constituents in the full development of its first 
member have negative coefficients that expansion may be written in the form 

via v l a 

vj and vj being each of the form 


ati a t a n t n 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


in which tt t n are constituents of the other symbols and aia a n in each 
case positive or vanishing quantities the result of elimination is 

hf 

and as the coefficients in v and v are none of them negative there can be no 
negative coefficients in the product v v hence the equation v v may be 
added to any other equation the coefficients of whose constituents are positive 
and the resulting equation will combine the full significance of those from which 
it was obtained 


proposition v 

 to deduce from the previous propositions a practical rule or method for 
the reduction of systems of equations expressing propositions in logic 

we have by the previous investigations established the following points viz 

st that any equations which are of the form v v satisfying the 
fundamental law of duality vl — v may be combined together by simple 
addition 

ndly that any other equations of the form v may be reduced by the 
process of squaring to a form in which the same principle of combination by 
mere addition is applicable 

it remains then only to determine what equations in the actual expression 
of propositions belong to the former and what to the latter class 

now the general types of propositions have been set forth in the conclusion 
of chap iv the division of propositions which they represent is as follows 

st propositions of which the subject is universal and the predicate par 
ticular 

the symbolical type iv is 


x vy 

x and y satisfying the law of duality eliminating v we have 

xv 

and this will be found also to satisfy the same law no further reduction by 
the process of squaring is needed 

nd propositions of which both terms are universal and of which the sym 
bolical type is 


x y 


x and y separately satisfying the law of duality writing the equation in 
the form x — y and squaring we have 


x xv y 
or x y y x 


 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


the first member of this equation satisfies the law of duality as is evident 
from its very form 

we may arrive at the same equation in a different manner the equation 


x y 

is equivalent to the two equations 

x vy y vx 

for to affirm that x’s are identical with y s is to affirm both that all x’s 
are y’ s and that all f’s are x’s now these equations give on elimination of 

v 

x y y x 
which added produce 

rd propositions of which both terms are particular the form of such 
propositions is 

vx vy 

but v is not quite arbitrary and therefore must not be eliminated for v is the 
representative of some which though it may include in its meaning all does 
not include none we must therefore transpose the second member to the first 
side and square the resulting equation according to the rule the result will 
obviously be 

vxl yvyl x 

the above conclusions it may be convenient to embody in a rule which will 
serve for constant future direction 

 rule — the equations being so expressed as that the terms x and y in 
the following typical forms obey the law of duality change the equations 

x vy into x y 

x y into x y y — x 
vx vy into vxl y vy x 

any equation which is given in the form x will not need transformation 
and any equation which presents itself in the form x may be replaced by 
 — x as appears from the second of the above transformations 

when the equations of the system have thus been reduced any of them as 
well as any equations derived from them by the process of elimination may be 
combined by addition 

 note— it has been seen in chapter iv that in literally translating the 
terms of a proposition without attending to its real meaning into the language 
of symbols we may produce equations in which the terms x and y do not 
obey the law of duality the equation w stp r given in prop of the 
chapter referred to is of this kind such equations however as it has been seen 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


have a meaning should it for curiosity or for any other motive be determined 
to employ them it will be best to reduce them by the rule vi 

 ex let us take the following propositions of elementary geometry 
st similar figures consist of all whose corresponding angles are equal and 
whose corresponding sides are proportional 

nd triangles whose corresponding angles are equal have their correspond 
ing sides proportional and vice versa 

to represent these premises let us make 
s similar 

t triangles 

q having corresponding angles equal 

r having corresponding sides proportional 

then the premises are expressed by the following equations 

s qr 

tq tr 

reducing by the rule or which amounts to the same thing bringing the terms 
of these equations to the first side squaring each equation and then adding we 
have 

s qr — qrs tq tr — tqr 

let it be required to deduce a description of dissimilar figures formed out of the 
elements expressed by the terms triangles having corresponding angles equal 
having corresponding sides proportional 

we have from 


tq qr rt — tqr 


„ qr — tq — rt tqr — 

 — s 

 qr — 

and fully developing the second member we find 

 — s tqr tql — r frl — q t — gl — r 

 tqr tq r tr q 

ltlglr 

in the above development two of the terms have the coefficient these must 
be equated to by the rule then those terms whose coefficients are being 
rejected we have 

 — s tl — q r tq r tr q 

lflglr 
tq r 

mi q 


 

 

 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


the direct interpretation of which is 

st dissimilar figures consist of all triangles which have not their corre 
sponding angles equal and sides proportional and of all figures not being trian 
gles which have either their angles equal and sides not proportional or their 
corresponding sides proportional and angles not equal or neither their corre 
sponding angles equal nor corresponding sides proportional 

nd there are no triangles whose corresponding angles are equal and sides 
not proportional 

rd there are no triangles whose corresponding sides are proportional and 
angles not equal 

 such are the immediate interpretations of the final equation it is seen in 
accordance with the general theory that in deducing a description of a particular 
class of objects viz dissimilar figures in terms of certain other elements of the 
original premises we obtain also the independent relations which exist among 
those elements in virtue of the same premises and that this is not superfluous 
information even as respects the immediate object of inquiry may easily be 
shown for example the independent relations may always be made use of 
to reduce if it be thought desirable to a briefer form the expression of that 
relation which is directly sought thus if we write in the form 

 tql r 

and add it to we get since 

il — — r tq r t r 

 — s tl — r — tq r tr q 

lflglr 

which on interpretation would give for the first term of the description of 
dissimilar figures “triangles whose corresponding sides are not proportional” 
instead of the fuller description originally obtained a regard to convenience 
must always determine the propriety of such reduction 

 a reduction which is always advantageous vii consists in collecting 
the terms of the immediate description sought as of the second member of 
or into as few groups as possible thus the third and fourth terms of the 
second member of produce by addition the single term — tl — q if this 
reduction be combined with the last we have 

 s tl r tq r il q 
the interpretation of which is 

dissimilar figures consist of all triangles whose corresponding sides are not 
proportional and all figures not being triangles which have either their cor 
responding angles unequal or their corresponding angles equal but sides not 
proportional 

the fulness of the general solution is therefore not a superfluity while it 
gives us all the information that we seek it provides us also with the means of 
expressing that information in the mode that is most advantageous 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


 another observation illustrative of a principle which has already been 
stated remains to be made two of the terms in the full development of — s in 
 have for their coefficients instead of g it will hereafter be shown that this 
circumstance indicates that the two premises were not independent to verify 
this let us resume the equations of the premises in their reduced forms viz 

sl — qr qr — s 
tq — r tr — q 

now if the first members of these equations have any common constituents they 
will appear on multiplying the equations together if we do this we obtain 

stq — r strl — q 

whence there will result 

stq — r str — q 

these being equations which are cleducible from either of the primitive ones 
their interpretations are — 

similar triangles which have their corresponding angles equal have their cor 
responding sides proportional 

similar triangles which have their corresponding sides proportional have their 
corresponding angles equal 

and these conclusions are equally deducible from either premiss singly in 
this respect according to the definitions laid down the premises are not inde 
pendent 

 let us in conclusion resume the problem discussed in illustration of the 
first method of this chapter and endeavour to ascertain by the present method 
what may be concluded from the presence of the property c with reference to 
the properties a and b 

we found on eliminating the symbols v the following equations viz 


xyiwz wz 

 

yzxu xw 

 

xy wz 

 


from these we are to eliminate w and determine now and already 
satisfy the condition vl — v the third equation gives on bringing the 
terms to the first side and squaring 

xyl — wz wz — xy 

adding and together we have 



chapter viii of reduction 


 


eliminating w we get 

 xyz yzx xyxyz yzx xyz zl — xy 

now on multiplying the terms in the second factor by those in the first succes 
sively observing that 

xx yy 
nearly all disappear and we have only left 

xyz xyz 


whence 

 

 — 

xy xy 

 xy xy xy xy 

 

 y xy 

furnishing the interpretation wherever the property c is found either the 
property a or the property b will be found with it but not both of them together 

from the equation we may readily deduce the result arrived at in the 
previous investigation by the method of arbitrary constant multipliers as well 
as any other proposed forms of the relation between x y and e g if the 
property b is absent either a and c will be jointly present or c will be absent 
and conversely if a and c are jointly present b will be absent the converse 
part of this conclusion is founded on the presence of a term xz with unity for 
its coefficient in the developed value of y 



chapter ix 

on certain methods of abbreviation 


 though the three fundamental methods of development elimination and 
reduction established and illustrated in the previous chapters are sufficient for 
all the practical ends of logic yet there are certain cases in which they admit 
and especially the method of elimination of being simplified in an important 
degree and to these i wish to direct attention in the present chapter i shall 
first demonstrate some propositions in which the principles of the above methods 
of abbreviation are contained and i shall afterwards apply them to particular 
examples 

let us designate as class terms any terms which satisfy the fundamental law 
vl — v such terms will individually be constituents but when occurring 
together will not as do the terms of a development necessarily involve the 
same symbols in each thus ax bxy cyz may be described as an expression 
consisting of three class terms x xy and yz multiplied by the coefficients a 
b c respectively the principle applied in the two following propositions and 
which in some instances greatly abbreviates the process of elimination is that 
of the rejection of superfluous class terms those being regarded as superfluous 
which do not add to the constituents of the final result 

proposition i 

 from any equation v in which v consists of a series of class terms 
having positive coefficients we are permitted to reject any term which contains 
another term as a factor and to change every positive coefficient to unity 

for the significance of this series of positive terms depends only upon the 
number and nature of the constituents of its final expansion ie of its expansion 
with reference to all the symbols which it involves and not at all upon the actual 
values of the coefficients vi now let x be any term of the series and xy 
any other term having a as a factor the expansion of x with reference to the 
symbols x and y will be 

xy xly 

and the expansion of the sum of the terms x and xy will be 

 xy x y

but by what has been said these expressions occurring in the first member 
of an equation of which the second member is and of which all the coefficients 
of the first member are positive are equivalent since there must exist simply 
the two constituents xy and x — y in the final expansion whence will simply 
arise the resulting equations 


xy x y 

and therefore the aggregate of terms x xy may be replaced by the single 
term x 

the same reasoning applies to all the cases contemplated in the proposition 
thus if the term x is repeated the aggregate x may be replaced by x because 
under the circumstances the equation x must appear in the final reduction 

proposition ii 

 whenever in the process of elimination we have to multiply together two 
factors each consisting solely of positive terms satisfying the fundamental law 
of logical symbols it is permitted to reject from both factors any common term 
or from either factor any term which is divisible by a term in the other factor 
provided always that the rejected term be added to the product of the resulting 
factors 

in the enunciation of this proposition the word “divisible” is a term of 
convenience used in the algebraic sense in which xy and x — y are said to 
be divisible by x 

to render more clear the import of this proposition let it be supposed that 
the factors to be multiplied together are x y z and x yw t it is then 
asserted that from these two factors we may reject the term x and that from 
the second factor we may reject the term yw provided that these terms be 
transferred to the final product thus the resulting factors being y z and t 
if to their product yt zt we add the terms x and yw we have 

x yw yt zt 

as an expression equivalent to the product of the given factors x y z and 
x yw t equivalent namely in the process of elimination 

let us consider first the case in which the two factors have a common term 
x and let us represent the factors by the expressions x p x q supposing p 
in the one case and q in the other to be the sum of the positive terms additional 
to x 

now 

x p x q x xp xq pq 

but the process of elimination consists in multiplying certain factors together 
and equating the result to either then the second member of the above 
equation is to be equated to or it is a factor of some expression which is to 
be equated to 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


if the former alternative be taken then by the last proposition we are 
permitted to reject the terms xp and xq inasmuch as they are positive terms 
having another term £ as a factor the resulting expression is 

x pq 

which is what we should obtain by rejecting x from both factors and adding it 
to the product of the factors which remain 

taking the second alternative the only mode in which the second member 
of can affect the final result of elimination must depend upon the number 
and nature of its constituents both which elements are unaffected by the rejec 
tion of the terms xp and xq for that development of x includes all possible 
constituents of which a is a factor 

consider finally the case in which one of the factors contains a term as xy 
divisible by a term x in the other factor 

let x p and xy q be the factors now 

x p xy q xy xq xyp pq 

but by the reasoning of the last proposition the term xyp may be rejected as 
containing another positive term xy as a factor whence we have 


xy xq pq 
 xy x pq 

but this expresses the rejection of the term xy from the second factor and its 
transference to the final product wherefore the proposition is manifest 

proposition iii 

 ift be any symbol which is retained in the final result of the elimination of 
any other symbols from any system of equations the result of such elimination 
may be expressed in the form 


et elt 

in which e is formed by making in the proposed system t and eliminating 
the same other symbols and e by making in the proposed system t and 
eliminating the same other symbols 

for let j f represent the final result of elimination expanding this 
equation we have 

lt olio 

now by whatever process we deduce the function j t from the proposed system 
of equations by the same process should we deduce l if in those equations 
t were changed into and by the same process should we deduce f if in the 
same equations t were changed into whence the truth of the proposition is 
manifest

 of the three propositions last proved it may be remarked that though 
quite unessential to the strict development or application of the general theory 
they yet accomplish important ends of a practical nature by prop we can 
simplify the results of addition by prop we can simplify those of multiplica 
tion and by prop we can break up any tedious process of elimination into two 
distinct processes which will in general be of a much less complex character 
this method will be very frequently adopted when the final object of inquiry is 
the determination of the value of t in terms of the other symbols which remain 
after the elimination is performed 

 ex aristotle in the nicomachean ethics book ii cap having 
determined that actions are virtuous not as possessing in themselves a certain 
character but as implying a certain condition of mind in him who performs 
them viz that he perform them knowingly and with deliberate preference 
and for their own sakes and upon fixed principles of conduct proceeds in the 
two following chapters to consider the question whether virtue is to be referred 
to the genus of passions or faculties or habits together with some other 
connected points he grounds his investigation upon the following premises 
from which also he deduces the general doctrine and definition of moral virtue 
of which the remainder of the treatise forms an exposition 

premises 

 virtue is either a passion udedoc or a faculty ouvapic or a habit s£u 

 passions are not things according to which we are praised or blamed or 
in which we exercise deliberate preference 

 faculties are not things according to which we are praised or blamed and 
which are accompanied by deliberate preference 

 virtue is something according to which we are praised or blamed and 
which is accompanied by deliberate preference 

 whatever art or science makes its work to be in a good state avoids ex 
tremes and keeps the mean in view relative to human nature to psaov itpoc 
ijpbc 

 virtue is more exact and excellent than any art or science this is an 
argument a fortiori if science and true art shun defect and extravagance alike 
much more does virtue pursue the undeviating line of moderation if they cause 
their work to be in a good state much more reason have to we to say that 
virtue causeth her peculiar work to be “in a good state” let the final premiss 
be thus interpreted let us also pretermit all reference to praise or blame since 
the mention of these in the premises accompanies only the mention of deliberate 
preference and this is an element which we purpose to retain we may then 
assume as our representative symbols 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


v virtue 
p passions 

 faculties 
h habits 

d things accompanied by deliberate preference 

g things causing their work to be in a good state 

m things keeping the mean in view relative to human nature 

using then q as an indefinite class symbol our premises will be expressed by 
the following equations 

v qpl h i p h hl p 

p qld 

 gid 

v qd 
g qm 
v qg 


and separately eliminating from these the symbols q 

v lplflhflplhhlplf 

pd 

fd 

v — d 

 rn 

s 

we shall first eliminate from and the symbol d and then determine 
v in relation to p and h now the addition of and gives 

p d v d 

from which eliminating d in the ordinary way we find 

ipfv 

adding this to and determining v we find 

 

v p p h f p h h p 
whence by development 

v hl flp 

the interpretation of this equation is virtue is a habit and not a faculty or a 
passion 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


next we will eliminate p and g from the original system of equations 
and then determine v in relation to h d and m we will in this case eliminate 
p and together on addition of and we get 

h pi x h i p h h p 

pd fd 

developing this with reference to p and we have 

v dpf i dp vi dl pf 
vl hlpl f 

whence the result of elimination will be 

v dvh dvh dv — h 

now w d r d i which by prop i is reducible to v d the product 
of this and the second factor is 


v dvh d 

which by prop ii reduces to d vvh or vh d 

in like manner this result multiplied by the third factor gives simply vhd 
lastly this multiplied by the fourth factor til — h gives as the final equation 

vdl — h 

it remains to eliminate g from and the result is 

il — m 

finally the equations and give on addition 

tl — d vd — h tl — m 

from which we have 

 

 — d dl — h — m 
and the development of this result gives 

v hdm 

f which the interpretation is virtue is a habit accompanied by deliberate pref 
erence and keeping in view the mean relative to human nature 

properly speaking this is not a definition but a description of virtue it is 
all however that can be correctly inferred from the premises aristotle specially 
connects with it the necessity of prudence to determine the safe and middle line

of action and there is no doubt that the ancient theories of virtue generally par 
took more of an intellectual character than those the theory of utility excepted 
which have most prevailed in modern days virtue was regarded as consisting in 
the right state and habit of the whole mind rather than in the single supremacy 
of conscience or the moral facility and to some extent those theories were un 
doubtedly right for though unqualified obedience to the dictates of conscience 
is an essential element of virtuous conduct yet the conformity of those dictates 
with those unchanging principles of rectitude aiwvia ofxatia which are founded 
in or which rather are themselves the foundation of the constitution of things 
is another element and generally this conformity in any high degree at least 
is inconsistent with a state of ignorance and mental hebetude reverting to 
the particular theory of aristotle it will probably appear to most that it is of 
too negative a character and that the shunning of extremes does not afford a 
sufficient scope for the expenditure of the nobler energies of our being aristotle 
seems to have been imperfectly conscious of this defect of his system when in 
the opening of his seventh book he spoke of an “heroic virtue” rising above the 
measure of human nature 

 i have already remarked viii that the theory of single equations or 
propositions comprehends questions which cannot be fully answered except in 
connexion with the theory of systems of equations this remark is exemplified 
when it is proposed to determine from a given single equation the relation not 
of some single elementary class but of some compound class involving in its 
expression more than one element in terms of the remaining elements the 
following particular example and the succeeding general problem are of this 
nature 

ex — let us resume the symbolical expression of the definition of wealth 
employed in chap vii viz 


w stp rl — p 


wherein as before 
w wealth 

s things limited in supply 
t things transferable 
p things productive of pleasure 
r things preventive of pain 

and suppose it required to determine hence the relation of things transferable 
and productive of pleasure to the other elements of the definition viz wealth 
things limited in supply and things preventive of pain 

the expression for things transferable and productive of pleasure is tp let 
us represent this by a new symbol y we have then the equations 

w st p r — p 

v tp 


 xtjv uttep ripiac apexriv riptocxiqv xtw xcu deiavnic eth book vii 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


from which if we eliminate t and p we may determine y as a function of w s 
and r the result interpreted will give the relation sought 

bringing the terms of these equations to the first side we have 

w — stp — str — p 

ytp 

and adding the squares of these equations together 

w stp str — p — wstp — wstr — p y tp — ytp 

developing the first member with respect to t and p in order to eliminate those 
symbols we have 

w s — ws — ytp w sr — wsr y t — p 

 w yltpw yl t p 

and the result of the elimination of t and p will be obtained by equating to 
the product of the four coefficients of 

tptlpltp and lflp 

or by prop the result of the elimination of t and p from the above 
equation will be of the form 


eyely 

wherein e is the result obtained by changing in the given equation y into 
and then eliminating t and p and e the result obtained by changing in the 
same equation y into and then eliminating t and p and the mode in each 
case of eliminating t and p is to multiply together the coefficients of the four 
constituents tp t — p c 

if we make y the coefficients become 
lst w — s s — w 

nd w — sr s — w r equivalent to by prop i 

rd and th w equivalent to by prop i 

hence the value of e will be 

w — s s — w 

again in making y we have for the coefficients 
lst w — s s — w equivalent to 

nd w — sr sr — w 

rd and th w 

the product of these coefficients gives 


e w — sr 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


the equation from which y is to be determined therefore is 

wl — s sl — u y ul — srl — y 

w — sr 

 wl — sr — wl — s — sl — w ’ 
and expanding the second member 

y wsr ws — r gul — sr gicl — sl — r 
 — wsr — iusl — r § — icl — sr 


 s wlslr 


whence reducing 


 

y ws — r wsr — ul — s 
with ul — s 


 

 


the interpretation of which is 

lst things transferable and productive of pleasure consist of all wealth lim 
ited in supply and not preventive of pain an indefinite amount of wealth lim 
ited in supply and preventive of pain and an indefinite amount of what is not 
wealth and not limited in supply 

nd all wealth is limited in supply 

i have in the above solution written in parentheses that part of the full 
description which is implied by the accompanying independent relation 

 the following problem is of a more general nature and will furnish an 
easy practical rule for problems such as the last 

general problem 

given any equation connecting the symbols x yw z 

required to determine the logical expression of any class expressed in any 
way by the symbols x y in terms of the remaining symbols w z c 

let us confine ourselves to the case in which there are but two symbols x 
y and two symbols w z a case sufficient to determine the general rule 

let v be the given equation and let jx y represent the class whose 
expression is to be determined 

assume t fxy then from the above two equations x and y are to be 
eliminated 

now the equation v may be expanded in the form 

axy bx — y — xy d — al — y 

a b c and d being functions of the symbols w and 

again as jx y represents a class or collection of things it must consist of 
a constituent or series of constituents whose coefficients are 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


wherefore if the full development of x y be represented in the form 

axy bxl — y cl — xy dl — xl — y 

the coefficients a b c d must each be or 

now reducing the equation t — fx y by transposition and squaring to the 
form 

tl fx y cjx y t 
and expanding with reference to x and y we get 


t — a a — txy t — b b — tx — y 
fl — c cl — fl xy 
t — d d — il — xl — y 

whence adding this to we have 


a tl — a al — txy 
b tl — b bl — txl — y c 

let the result of the elimination of x and y be of the form 

et elt 

then e will by what has been said be the reduced product of what the 
coefficients of the above expansion become when t and e the product of 
the same factors similarly reduced by the condition t 

hence e will be the reduced product 

a — ab — bc cd d 

considering any factor of this expression as a — a we see that when a 
it becomes a and when a it becomes a which reduces by prop i to 
 hence we may infer that e will be the product of the coefficients of those 
constituents in the development of v whose coefficients in the development of 
x y are 

moreover e will be the reduced product 

 a ab bc cd d 

considering any one of these factors as a a we see that this becomes a 
when a and reduces to when a and so on for the others hence e 
will be the product of the coefficients of those constituents in the development 
of y whose coefficients in the development pxy are viewing these cases 
together we may establish the following rule 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


 to deduce from a logical equation the relation of any class expressed by 
a given combination of the symbols x y c to the classes represented by any 
other symbols involved in the given equation 

rule expand the given equation with reference to the symbols x y then 
form the equation 

etelt 

in which e is the product of the coefficients of all those constituents in the above 
development whose coefficients in the expression of the given class are and 
e the product of the coefficients of those constituents of the development whose 
coefficients in the expression of the given class are the value of t deduced 
from the above equation by solution and interpretation will be the expression 
required 

note— a lthough in the demonstration of this ride v is supposed to consist 
solely of positive terms it may easily be shown that this condition is unnecessary 
and the ride general and that no preparation of the given equation is really 
required 

 ex the same definition of wealth being given as in example 
required an expression for things transferable but not productive of pleasure 
t — p in terms of the other elements represented by w s and r 

the equation 

w — stp — sf’l — p 

gives when squared 

w stp str — p — wstp — wstrl — p 
and developing the first member with respect to t and p 

w s — wstp w sr — wsrtl — p wl — tp 

tul tl —p 

the coefficients of which it is best to exhibit as in the following equation 

ul — s sl — wtp wl — sr srl — wtl — p wl — tp 

tul £ p 

let the function tl — p to be determined be represented by z then the 
full development of z in respect of t and p is 

z tp t p tp — tl — p 

hence by the last problem we have 


ez elz 
where e rul — sr srl — w 
e wl — s sl — w x w x w wl — s 

 wl — sr srl — wz wl — sl — z 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


hence 


ul — s 

z 

 wsr — ws — sr 

 wsr ousl — r tul — sr ul — sl — r 

 — wsr jjl — tosl — r jjl — wl — sr 

 j wlslr 

or z wsr — twsl — r — ul — s 

with wl — s — 

hence things transferable and not productive of pleasure are either wealth 
limited in supply and preventive of pain or things which are not wealth but 
limited in supply and not preventive of pain or things which are not wealth and 
are unlimited in supply 

the following results deduced in a similar manner will be easily verified 

things limited in supply and productive of pleasure which are not wealth are 
intransferable 

wealth that is not productive of pleasure is transferable limited in supply 
and preventive of pain 

things limited in supply which are either wealth or are productive of plea 
sure but not both are either transferable and preventive of pain or intransfer 
able 

 from the domain of natural history a large number of curious examples 
might be selected i do not however conceive that such applications would 
possess any independent value they would for instance throw no light upon 
the true principles of classification in the science of zoology for the discovery 
of these some basis of positive knowledge is requisite some acquaintance with 
organic structure with teleological adaptation and this is a species of knowledge 
which can only be derived from the use of external means of observation and 
analysis taking however any collection of propositions in natural history 
a great number of logical problems present themselves without regard to the 
system of classification adopted perhaps in forming such examples it is better 
to avoid as superfluous the mention of that property of a class or species which 
is immediately suggested by its name eg the ringstructure in the annelida a 
class of animals including the earthworm and the leech 

ex the annelida are softbodied and either naked or enclosed in a 
tube 

 the annelida consist of all invertebrate animals having red blood in a 
double system of circulating vessels 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


assume a annelida 

s softbodied animals 
n naked 

t enclosed in a tube 
i invertebrate 
r having red blood c 

then the propositions given will be expressed by the equations 

a vsn — t tl — n 

a ir 

to which we may add the implied condition 

nt 

on eliminating v and reducing the system to a single equation we have 

al — snl — t — st — n al — ir ir — a nt 

suppose that we wish to obtain the relation in which softbodied animals 
enclosed in tubes arc placed by virtue of the premises with respect to the 
following elements viz the possession of red blood of an external covering 
and of a vertebral column 

we must first eliminate a the result is 

irl — snl — t — st — n nt 

then ix developing with respect to s and t and reducing the first 
coefficient by prop we have 

nst ir — nsl — t ir nl — st ir — sl — t 

hence if st w we find 

nw ir — n x ir n x ir — w 
or 

nw ir — nl — w 

ir — n 

w t a 

ir — n — n 

 irn ir — n il — rn — rl — n 

 — irn jjl — ir — n — zl — rn 

or w ir — n il — rl — n — — n 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


hence softbodied animals enclosed in tubes consist of all invertebrate ani 
mals having red blood and not naked and an indefinite remainder of invertebrate 
animals not having red blood and not naked and of vertebrate animals which 
are not naked 

and in an exactly similar manner the following reduced equations the inter 
pretation of which is left to the reader have been deduced from the development 
 


sl — t irn jjil — n — i 

 st jjl ir n jjl rl n 

 sl t jjil r jjl i 

in none of the above examples has it been my object to exhibit in any special 
manner the power of the method that i conceive can only be fully displayed 
in connexion with the mathematical theory of probabilities i would however 
suggest to any who may be desirous of forming a correct opinion upon this 

point that they examine by the rules of ordinary logic the following problem 

before inspecting its solution remembering at the same time that whatever 
complexity it possesses might be multiplied indefinitely with no other effect 
than to render its solution by the method of this work more operose but not 
less certainly attainable 

ex let the observation of a class of natural productions be supposed to 
have led to the following general results 

st that in whichsoever of these productions the properties a and c are 
missing the property e is found together with one of the properties b and d 
but not with both 

nd that wherever the properties a and d are found while e is missing 
the properties b and c will either both be found or both be missing 

rd that wherever the property a is found in conjunction with either b 
or e or both of them there either the property c or the property d will be 
found but not both of them and conversely wherever the property c or d is 
found singly there the property a will be found in conjunction with either b 
or e or both of them 

let it then be required to ascertain first what in any particular instance may 
be concluded from the ascertained presence of the property a with reference 
to the properties b c and d also whether any relations exist independently 
among the properties b c and d secondly what may be concluded in like 
manner respecting the property b and the properties a c and d 

it will be observed that in each of the three data the information conveyed 
respecting the properties a b c and d is complicated with another element 
e about which we desire to say nothing in our conclusion it will hence be 
requisite to eliminate the symbol representing the property e from the system 
of equations by which the given propositions will be expressed 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


let us represent the property a by x b by y c by z d by w e by v the 
data are 


xz qvyw wy 

 

vxw qyz yz 

 

xy xvy wz zw 

 


x standing for — x c and q being an indefinite class symbol eliminating 
q separately from the first and second equations and adding the results to the 
third equation reduced by chap viii we get 

xz — vyw — vwy vxwyz zy xy xvywz wz 
 wz zw — xy — xvy 

from this equation v must be eliminated and the value of x determined 
from the result for effecting this object it will be convenient to employ the 
method of prop of the present chapter 

let then the result of elimination be represented by the equation 

ex el x 

to find e make x in the first member of we find 

vwyz zy y vywz uiz wz zwvy 

eliminating v we have 

wz wz wyz zy ywz wz ywz zw 

which on actual multiplication in accordance with the conditions ww 
 c gives 

e wz ywz 

next to find e make x in we have 

 — vyw — vyw wz zw 

whence eliminating v and reducing the result by propositions and we 
find 

e — wz zw ywz 

and therefore finally we have 

wz ywzx wz zui ywzx 


from which

wherefore by development

or collecting the terms in vertical columns 

x zw zw yzw 

the interpretation of which is 

in whatever substances the property a is found there will also be found 
either the property c or the property d but not both or else the properties b 
c and d will all be wanting and conversely where either the property c 
or the property d is found singly or the properties b c and d are together 
missing there the property a will be found 

it also appears that there is no independent relation among the properties 
b c and d 

secondly we are to find y now developing with respect to that symbol 


 xwz xwz xwz xzwy xwz xwz xzw xzwy 
whence proceeding as before 


 

y xwz xwz xwz xzw 

 

xzw

from reduced by solution to the form

we have the independent relation if the property a is absent and c present 
d is present again by addition and solution and give 

 

xz xz to 

whence we have for the general solution and the remaining independent 
relation 



chapter ix methods of abbreviation 


 


st if the property b he present in one of the productions either the prop 
erties a c and d are all absent or some one alone of them is absent and 
conversely if they are all absent it may be concluded that the property a is 
present 

nd if a and c are both present or both absent d will be absent quite 
independently of the presence or absence of b and 

i have not attempted to verify these conclusions 



chapter x 


of the conditions of a perfect method 


 the subject of primary propositions has been discussed at length and we are 
about to enter upon the consideration of secondary propositions the interval 
of transition between these two great divisions of the science of logic may afford 
a fit occasion for us to pause and while reviewing some of the past steps of our 
progress to inquire what it is that in a subject like that with which we have 
been occupied constitutes perfection of method i do not here speak of that 
perfection only which consists in power but of that also which is founded in the 
conception of what is fit and beautiful it is probable that a careful analysis 
of this question would conduct us to some such conclusion as the following 
viz that a perfect method should not only be an efficient one as respects the 
accomplishment of the objects for which it is designed but should in all its parts 
and processes manifest a certain unity and harmony this conception would be 
most fully realized if even the very forms of the method were suggestive of 
the fundamental principles and if possible of the one fundamental principle 
upon which they are founded in applying these considerations to the science 
of reasoning it may be well to extend our view beyond the mere analytical 
processes and to inquire what is best as respects not only the mode or form of 
deduction but also the system of data or premises from which the deduction is 
to be made 

 as respects mere power there is no doubt that the first of the methods 
developed in chapter viii is within its proper sphere a perfect one the 
introduction of arbitrary constants makes us independent of the forms of the 
premises as well as of any conditions among the equations by which they are 
represented but it seems to introduce a foreign element and while it is a more 
laborious it is also a less elegant form of solution than the second method of 
reduction demonstrated in the same chapter there are however conditions 
under which the latter method assumes a more perfect form than it otherwise 
bears to make the one fundamental condition expressed by the equation 

xl — x 

the universal type of form would give a unity of character to both processes 
and results which would not else be attainable were brevity or convenience the 


 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


only valuable quality of a method no advantage would flow from the adoption 
of such a principle for to impose upon every step of a solution the character 
above described would involve in some instances no slight labour of preliminary 
reduction but it is still interesting to know that this can be done and it is even 
of some importance to be acquainted with the conditions under which such a 
form of solution would spontaneously present itself some of these points will 
be considered in the present chapter 

proposition i 

 to reduce any equation among logical symbols to the form v in which 
v satisfies the law of duality 


v v 

it is shown in chap v prop that the above condition is satisfied when 
ever v is the sum of a series of constituents and it is evident from prop 
chap vi that all equations are equivalent which when reduced by transpo 
sition to the form v produce by development of the first member the 
same series of constituents with coefficients which do not vanish the particular 
numerical values of those coefficients being immaterial 

hence the object of this proposition may always be accomplished by bringing 
all the terms of an equation to the first side fidly expanding that member and 
changing in the result all the coefficients which do not vanish into unity except 
such as have already that value 

but as the development of functions containing many symbols conducts us 
to expressions inconvenient from their great length it is desirable to show how 
in the only cases which do practically offer themselves to our notice this source 
of complexity may be avoided 

the great primary forms of equations have already been discussed in chapter 
viii they are 


x 

 vy 

x 

 y 

vx 

 vy 


whenever the conditions x — x y — y are satisfied we have 
seen that the two first of the above equations conduct us to the forms 


 

x y yl — x 

and under the same circumstances it may be shown that the last of them 
gives 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


txl v f x 

all which results obviously satisfy in their first members the condition 

vl v 

now as the above are the forms and conditions under which the equations 
of a logical system properly expressed do actually present themselves it is al 
ways possible to reduce them by the above method into subjection to the law 
required though however the separate equations may thus satisfy the law 
their equivalent sum viii may not do so and it remains to show how upon 
it also the requisite condition may be imposed 

let us then represent the equation formed by adding the several reduced 
equations of the system together in the form 

v v v c 

this equation being singly equivalent to the system from which it was ob 
tained we suppose vvv c to be class terms ix satisfying the condi 
tions 


il — v vl — v c 

now the full interpretation of would be found by developing the first 
member with respect to all the elementary symbols x y c which it contains 
and equating to all the constituents whose coefficients do not vanish in other 
words all the constituents which are found in either v v v c but those 
constituents consist oflst such as are found in i nd such as are not found in 
v but are found in v rd such as are neither found in v nor v but are found 
in v and so on hence they will be such as are found in the expression 

v — vv — ul — vv c 

an expression in which no constituents are repeated and which obviously satis 
fies the law v — v 

thus if we had the expression 

 — t v — z tzw 

in which the terms — t — z are bracketed to indicate that they are to be 
taken as single class terms we should in accordance with reduce it to an 
expression satisfying the condition v — v by multiplying all the terms 
after the first by t then all after the second by — v lastly the term which 
remains after the third by z the result being 

 — t tv tl — il — z t — vzw 

 all logical equations then are reducible to the form v v satisfy 
ing the law of duality but it would obviously be a higher degree of perfection 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


if equations always presented themselves in such a form without preparation 
of any kind and not only exhibited this form in their original statement but 
retained it unimpaired after those additions which are necessary in order to 
reduce systems of equations to single equivalent forms that they do not spon 
taneously present this feature is not properly attributable to defect of method 
but is a consequence of the fact that our premises are not always complete and 
accurate and independent they are not complete when they involve material 
as distinguished from formal relations which are not expressed they are not 
accurate when they imply relations which are not intended but setting aside 
these points with which in the present instance we are less concerned let it 
be considered in what sense they may fail of being independent 

 a system of propositions may be termed independent when it is not 
possible to deduce from any portion of the system a conclusion deducible from 
any other portion of it supposing the equations representing those propositions 
all reduced to the form 

v 

then the above condition implies that no constituent which can be made to 
appear in the development of a particular function v of the system can be made 
to appear in the development of any other function v of the same system when 
this condition is not satisfied the equations of the system are not independent 
this may happen in various cases let all the equations satisfy in their first 
members the law of duality then if there appears a positive term x in the 
expansion of one equation and a term xy in that of another the equations are 
not independent for the term x is further developable into xy xl — y and 
the equation 

xy 

is thus involved in both the equations of the system again let a term xy appear 
in one equation and a term xz in another both these may be developed so as 
to give the common constituent xyz and other cases may easily be imagined 
in which premises which appear at first sight to be quite independent are not 
really so whenever equations of the form v are thus not truly independent 
though individually they may satisfy the law of duality 

fl v 

the equivalent equation obtained by adding them together will not satisfy that 
condition unless sufficient reductions by the method of the present chapter 
have been performed when on the other hand the equations of a system both 
satisfy the above law and are independent of each other their sum will also 
satisfy the same law i have dwelt upon these points at greater length than 
would otherwise have been necessary because it appears to me to be important 
to endeavour to form to ourselves and to keep before us in all our investigations 
the pattern of an ideal perfection — the object and the guide of future efforts in 
the present class of inquiries the chief aim of improvement of method should be 
to facilitate as far as is consistent with brevity the transformation of equations 
so as to make the fundamental condition above adverted to universal 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


in connexion with this subject the following propositions are deserving of 
attention 

proposition ii 

if the first member of any equation v satisfy the condition v — v 
 and if the expression of any symbol t of that equation be determined as a 
developed function of the other symbols the coefficients of the expansion can 

only assume the forms 

for if the equation be expanded with reference to t we obtain as the result 

et e lt 

e and e being what v becomes when t is successively changed therein into 
and hence e and e will themselves satisfy the conditions 

e e e e 

now gives 

e 

f e e 

the second member of which is to be expanded as a function of the remaining 
symbols it is evident that the only numerical values which e and e’ can receive 
in the calculation of the coefficients will be and the following cases alone 
can therefore arise 

e 

st e’ e then 

’ ’ e e 

e 

nd e e then — — 

e — e 
e 

rd e e then 

’ ’ e e 

th e e then jj 

whence the truth of the proposition is manifest 

 it may be remarked that the forms and appear in the solution of 
equations independently of any reference to the condition v — v but it 
is not so with the coefficient jj the terms to which this coefficient is attached 
when the above condition is satisfied may receive any other value except the 
three values and g when that condition is not satisfied it is permitted 
and it would conduce to uniformity to change any coefficient of a development 
not presenting itself in any of the four forms referred to in this proposition into 
g regarding this as the symbol proper to indicate that the coefficient to which 
it is attached should be equated to this course i shall frequently adopt 


proposition iii 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


 the result of the elimination of any symbols x y c from an equation 

v of which the first member identically satisfies the law of duality 

vl v 

may be obtained by developing the given equation with reference to the other 
symbols and equating to the sum of those constituents whose coefficients in 
the expansion are equal to unity 

suppose that the given equation v involves but three symbols x y and 
t of which x and y are to be eliminated let the development of the equation 
with respect to t be 

at blt 

a and b being free from the symbol t 

by chap ix prop the result of the elimination of x and y from the 
given equation will be of the form 

etelt 

in which e is the result obtained by eliminating the symbols x and y from the 
equation a e the result obtained by eliminating from the equation b 
now a and b must satisfy the condition 

 a b 

hence a confining ourselves for the present to this coefficient will either 
be or or a constituent or the sum of a part of the constituents which 
involve the symbols x and y if a it is evident that e if a is a single 
constituent or the sum of a part of the constituents involving x and y e will 
be for the full development of a with respect to x and y will contain terms 
with vanishing coefficients and e is the product of all the coefficients hence 
when a e is equal to a but in other cases e is equal to similarly when 
b e is equal to b but in other cases e vanishes hence the expression 
will consist of that part if any there be of in which the coefficients a b 
are unity and this reasoning is general suppose for instance that v involved 
the symbols x y z t and that it were required to eliminate x and y then if 
the development of v with reference to and t were 

zt xzl — t y — zt — z — t 
the result sought would be 

zt — z — t 

this being that portion of the development of which the coefficients are unity 
hence if from any system of equations we deduce a single equivalent equation 

v v satisfying the condition 


vi v 



chapter x conditions of a perfect method 


 


the ordinary processes of elimination may be entirely dispensed with and 
the single process of development made to supply their place 

 it may be that there is no practical advantage in the method thus pointed 
out but it possesses a theoretical unity and completeness which render it de 
serving of regard and i shall accordingly devote a future chapter xiv to its 
illustration the progress of applied mathematics has presented other and signal 
examples of the reduction of systems of problems or equations to the dominion 
of some central but pervading law 

 it is seen from what precedes that there is one class of propositions 
to which all the special appliances of the above methods of preparation are 
unnecessary it is that which is characterized by the following conditions 

first that the propositions are of the ordinary kind implied by the use of 
the copula is or are the predicates being particular 

secondly that the terms of the proposition are intelligible without the sup 
position of any understood relation among the elements which enter into the 
expression of those terms 

thirdly that the propositions are independent 

we may if such speculation is not altogether vain permit ourselves to con 
jecture that these are the conditions which would be obeyed in the employment 
of language as an instrument of expression and of thought by unerring beings 
declaring simply what they mean without suppression on the one hand and 
without repetition on the other considered both in their relation to the idea 
of a perfect language and in their relation to the processes of an exact method 
these conditions are equally worthy of the attention of the student 



chapter xi 

of secondary propositions and of the 
principles of their symbolical expression 


 the doctrine has already been established in chap iv that every logical 
proposition may be referred to one or the other of two great classes viz primary 
propositions and secondary propositions the former of these classes has been 
discussed in the preceding chapters of this work and we are now led to the 
consideration of secondary propositions ie of propositions concerning or 
relating to other propositions regarded as true or false the investigation upon 
which we are entering will in its general order and progress resemble that 
which we have already conducted the two inquiries differ as to the subjects 
of thought which they recognise not as to the formal and scientific laws which 
they reveal or the methods or processes which are founded upon those laws 
probability would in some measure favour the expectation of such a result it 
consists with all that we know of the uniformity of nature and all that we 
believe of the immutable constancy of the author of nature to suppose that 
in the mind which has been endowed with such high capabilities not only 
for converse with surrounding scenes but for the knowledge of itself and for 
reflection upon the laws of its own constitution there should exist a harmony 
and uniformity not less real than that which the study of the physical sciences 
makes known to us anticipations such as this are never to be made the primary 
rule of our inquiries nor are they in any degree to divert us from those labours 
of patient research by which we ascertain what is the actual constitution of 
things within the particular province submitted to investigation but when the 
grounds of resemblance have been properly and independently determined it 
is not inconsistent even with purely scientific ends to make that resemblance 
a subject of meditation to trace its extent and to receive the intimations of 
truth yet undiscovered which it may seem to us to convey the necessity of 
a final appeal to fact is not thus set aside nor is the use of analogy extended 
beyond its proper sphere the suggestion of relations which independent inquiry 
must either verify or cause to be rejected 

 secondary propositions are those which concern or relate to propositions 
considered as true or false the relations of things we express by primary propo 
sitions but we are able to make propositions themselves also the subject of 


 



chapter xl of secondary propositions 


 


thought and to express our judgments concerning them the expression of any 
such judgment constitutes a secondary proposition there exists no proposition 
whatever of which a competent degree of knowledge would not enable us to 
make one or the other of these two assertions viz either that the proposition is 
true or that it is false and each of these assertions is a secondary proposition 
“it is true that the sun shines” “it is not true that the planets shine by their 
own light” are examples of this kind in the former example the proposition 
“the sun shines” is asserted to be true in the latter the proposition “the 
planets shine by their own light” is asserted to be false secondary propositions 
also include all judgments by which we express a relation or dependence among 
propositions to this class or division we may refer conditional propositions 
as “if the sun shine the day will be fair” also most disjunctive propositions 
as “either the sun will shine or the enterprise will be postponed” in the for 
mer example we express the dependence of the truth of the proposition “the 
day will be fair” upon the truth of the proposition “the sun will shine” in 
the latter we express a relation between the two propositions “the sun will 
shine” “the enterprise will be postponed” implying that the truth of the one 
excludes the truth of the other to the same class of secondary propositions 
we must also refer all those propositions which assert the simultaneous truth or 
falsehood of propositions as “it is not true both that ‘the sun will shine’ and 
that ‘the journey will be postponed’ ” the elements of distinction which we 
have noticed may even be blended together in the same secondary proposition 
it may involve both the disjunctive element expressed by either or and the 
conditional element expressed by if in addition to which the connected propo 
sitions may themselves be of a compound character if “the sun shine” and 
“leisure permit” then either “the enterprise shall be commenced” or “some 
preliminary step shall be taken” in this example a number of propositions are 
connected together not arbitrarily and unmeaningly but in such a manner as 
to express a definite connexion between them a connexion having reference to 
their respective truth or falsehood this combination therefore according to 
our definition forms a secondary proposition 

the theory of secondary propositions is deserving of attentive study as well 
on account of its varied applications as for that close and harmonious analogy 
already referred to which it sustains with the theory of primary propositions 
upon each of these points i desire to offer a few further observations 

 i would in the first place remark that it is in the form of secondary 
propositions at least as often as in that of primary propositions that the rea 
sonings of ordinary life are exhibited the discourses too of the moralist and 
the metaphysician are perhaps less often concerning things and their qualities 
than concerning principles and hypotheses concerning truths and the mutual 
connexion and relation of truths the conclusions which our narrow experience 
suggests in relation to the great questions of morals and society yet unsolved 
manifest in more ways than one the limitations of their human origin and 
though the existence of universal principles is not to be questioned the par 
tial formulae which comprise our knowledge of their application are subject to 
conditions and exceptions and failure thus in those departments of inquiry 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


which from the nature of their subjectmatter should be the most interesting of 
all much of our actual knowledge is hypothetical that there has been a strong 
tendency to the adoption of the same forms of thought in writers on speculative 
philosophy will hereafter appear hence the introduction of a general method 
for the discussion of hypothetical and the other varieties of secondary proposi 
tions will open to us a more interesting field of applications than we have before 
met with 

 the discussion of the theory of secondary propositions is in the next 
place interesting from the close and remarkable analogy which it bears with 
the theory of primary propositions it will appear that the formal laws to 
which the operations of the mind are subject are identical in expression in 
both cases the mathematical processes which are founded on those laws are 
therefore identical also thus the methods which have been investigated in the 
former portion of this work will continue to be available in the new applications 
to which we are about to proceed but while the laws and processes of the 
method remain unchanged the rule of interpretation must be adapted to new 
conditions instead of classes of things we shall have to substitute propositions 
and for the relations of classes and individuals we shall have to consider the 
connexions of propositions or of events still between the two systems however 
differing in purport and interpretation there will be seen to exist a pervading 
harmonious relation an analogy which while it serves to facilitate the conquest 
of every yet remaining difficulty is of itself an interesting subject of study and 
a conclusive proof of that unity of character which marks the constitution of 
the human faculties 


proposition i 

 to investigate the nature of the connexion of secondary propositions with 
the idea of time 

it is necessary in entering upon this inquiry to state clearly the nature of 
the analogy which connects secondary with primary propositions 

primary propositions express relations among things viewed as component 
parts of a universe within the limits of which whether coextensive with the 
limits of the actual universe or not the matter of our discourse is confined 
the relations expressed are essentially substantive some or all or none of the 
members of a given class are also members of another class the subjects to 
which primary propositions refer the relations among those subjects which they 
expressare all of the above character 

but in treating of secondary propositions we find ourselves concerned with 
another class both of subjects and relations for the subjects with which we have 
to do are themselves propositions so that the question may be asked can we 
regard these subjects also as things and refer them by analogy with the previous 
case to a universe of their own again the relations among these subject 
propositions are relations of coexistent truth or falsehood not of substantive 
equivalence we do not say when expressing the connexion of two distinct 
propositions that the one is the other but use some such forms of speech as 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


the following according to the meaning which we desire to convey “either the 
proposition x is true or the proposition y is true” “if the proposition x is 
true the proposition y is true” “the propositions x and y are jointly true” 
and so on 

now in considering any such relations as the above we are not called upon 
to inquire into the whole extent of their possible meaning for this might involve 
us in metaphysical questions of causation which are beyond the proper limits of 
science but it suffices to ascertain some meaning which they undoubtedly pos 
sess and which is adequate for the purposes of logical deduction let us take 
as an instance for examination the conditional proposition “if the proposition 
x is true the proposition y is true” an undoubted meaning of this proposi 
tion is that the time in which the proposition x is true is time in which the 
proposition y is true this indeed is only a relation of coexistence and may 
or may not exhaust the meaning of the proposition but it is a relation really 
involved in the statement of the proposition and further it suffices for all the 
purposes of logical inference 

the language of common life sanctions this view of the essential connexion 
of secondary propositions with the notion of time thus we limit the application 
of a primary proposition by the word “some” but that of a secondary propo 
sition by the word “sometimes” to say “sometimes injustice triumphs” is 
equivalent to asserting that there are times in which the proposition “injustice 
now triumphs” is a true proposition there are indeed propositions the truth 
of which is not thus limited to particular periods or conjunctures propositions 
which are true throughout all time and have received the appellation of “eternal 
truths” the distinction must be familiar to every reader of plato and aristotle 
by the latter of whom especially it is employed to denote the contrast between 
the abstract verities of science such as the propositions of geometry which are 
always true and those contingent or phaenomenal relations of things which are 
sometimes true and sometimes false but the forms of language in which both 
kinds of propositions are expressed manifest a common dependence upon the 
idea of time in the one case as limited to some finite duration in the other as 
stretched out to eternity 

 it may indeed be said that in ordinary reasoning we are often quite 
unconscious of this notion of time involved in the very language we are using 
but the remark however just only serves to show that we commonly reason by 
the aid of words and the forms of a wellconstructed language without attending 
to the ulterior grounds upon which those very forms have been established the 
course of the present investigation will afford an illustration of the very same 
principle i shall avail myself of the notion of time in order to determine the laws 
of the expression of secondary propositions as well as the laws of combination 
of the symbols by which they are expressed but when those laws and those 
forms are once determined this notion of time essential as i believe it to be 
to the above end may practically be dispensed with we may then pass from 
the forms of common language to the closely analogous forms of the symbolical 
instrument of thought here developed and use its processes and interpret its 
results without any conscious recognition of the idea of time whatever 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


proposition ii 

 to establish a system of notation for the expression of secondary propo 
sitions and to show that the symbols which it involves are subject to the same 
laws of combination as the corresponding symbols employed in the expression of 
primary propositions 

let us employ the capital letters x y z to denote the elementary propo 
sitions concerning which we desire to make some assertion touching their truth 
or falsehood or among which we seek to express some relation in the form of 
a secondary proposition and let us employ the corresponding small letters x 
y z considered as expressive of mental operations in the following sense viz 
let x represent an act of the mind by which we fix our regard upon that portion 
of time for which the proposition x is true and let this meaning be understood 
when it is asserted that x denotes the time for which the proposition x is true 
let us further employ the connecting signs c in the following sense 

viz let x y denote the aggregate of those portions of time for which the 
propositions x and y are respectively true those times being entirely sepa 
rated from each other similarly let x — y denote that remainder of time which 
is left when we take away from the portion of time for which x is true that 
by supposition included portion for which y is true also let x — y denote 
that the time for which the proposition x is true is identical with the time for 
which the proposition y is true we shall term x the representative symbol of 
the proposition x c 

from the above definitions it will follow that we shall always have 

x y y x 

for either member will denote the same aggregate of time 

let us further represent by xy the performance in succession of the two op 
erations represented by y and x ie the whole mental operation which consists 
of the following elements viz st the mental selection of that portion of time 
for which the proposition y is true ndly the mental selection out of that 
portion of time of such portion as it contains of the time in which the propo 
sition x is true the result of these successive processes being the fixing of the 
mental regard upon the whole of that portion of time for which the propositions 
x and y are both true 

from this definition it will follow that we shall always have 


xy yx 

for whether we select mentally first that portion of time for which the 
proposition y is true then out of the result that contained portion for which x 
is true or first that portion of time for which the proposition x is true then 
out of the result that contained portion of it for which the proposition y is true 
we shall arrive at the same final result viz that portion of time for which the 
propositions x and y are both true 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


by continuing this method of reasoning it may be established that the laws 
of combination of the symbols x y z c in the species of interpretation here 
assigned to them are identical in expression with the laws of combination of 
the same symbols in the interpretation assigned to them in the first part of this 
treatise the reason of this final identity is apparent for in both cases it is 
the same faculty or the same combination of faculties of which we study the 
operations operations the essential character of which is unaffected whether we 
suppose them to be engaged upon that universe of things in which all existence 
is contained or upon that whole of time in which all events are realized and to 
some part at least of which all assertions truths and propositions refer 

thus in addition to the laws above stated we shall have by chap ii 
the law whose expression is 

xy z xy xz 

and more particularly the fundamental law of duality chap ii whose 
expression is 


x x or xl — x 

a law which while it serves to distinguish the system of thought in logic 
from the system of thought in the science of quantity gives to the processes 
of the former a completeness and a generality which they could not otherwise 
possess 

 again as this law as well as the other laws is satisfied by the 
symbols and we are led as before to inquire whether those symbols do not 
admit of interpretation in the present system of thought the same course of 
reasoning which we before pursued shows that they do and warrants us in the 
two following positions viz 

st that in the expression of secondary propositions represents nothing 
in reference to the element of time 

nd that in the same system represents the universe or whole of time 
to which the discourse is supposed in any manner to relate 

as in primary propositions the universe of discourse is sometimes limited to 
a small portion of the actual universe of things and is sometimes coextensive 
with that universe so in secondary propositions the universe of discourse may 
be limited to a single day or to the passing moment or it may comprise the whole 
duration of time it may in the most literal sense be “eternal” indeed unless 
there is some limitation expressed or implied in the nature of the discourse the 
proper interpretation of the symbol in secondary propositions is “eternity” 
even as its proper interpretation in the primary system is the actually existent 
universe 

 instead of appropriating the symbols x y z to the representation of the 
truths of propositions we might with equal propriety apply them to represent 
the occurrence of events in fact the occurrence of an event both implies and 
is implied by the truth of a proposition viz of the proposition which asserts 
the occurrence of the event the one signification of the symbol x necessarily 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


involves the other it will greatly conduce to convenience to be able to em 
ploy our symbols in either of these really equivalent interpretations which the 
circumstances of a problem may suggest to us as most desirable and of this lib 
erty i shall avail myself whenever occasion requires in problems of pure logic 
i shall consider the symbols x y c as representing elementary propositions 
among which relation is expressed in the premises in the mathematical theory 
of probabilities which as before intimated i rests upon a basis of logic 
and which it is designed to treat in a subsequent portion of this work i shall 
employ the same symbols to denote the simple events whose implied or required 
frequency of occurrence it counts among its elements 

proposition iii 

 to deduce general rides for the expression of secondary propositions 

in the various inquiries arising out of this proposition fulness of demonstra 
tion will be the less necessary because of the exact analogy which they bear 
with similar inquiries already completed with reference to primary propositions 
we shall first consider the expression of terms secondly that of the propositions 
by which they are connected 

as denotes the whole duration of time and x that portion of it for which 
the proposition x is true — x will denote that portion of time for which the 
proposition x is false 

again as xy denotes that portion of time for which the propositions x and 
y are both true we shall by combining this and the previous observation be 
led to the following interpretations viz 

the expression xl — y will represent the time during which the proposition 
x is true and the proposition y false the expression — xl — y will 
represent the time during which the propositions x and y are simultaneously 
false 

the expression xl — y y — x will express the time during which either 
x is true or y true but not both for that time is the sum of the times in which 
they are singly and exclusively true the expression xy — xl — y will 
express the time during which x and y are either both true or both false 

if another symbol presents itself the same principles remain applicable 
thus xyz denotes the time in which the propositions x y and z are simulta 
neously true — xl — yl — z the time in which they are simultaneously 
false and the sum of these expressions would denote the time in which they are 
either true or false together 

the general principles of interpretation involved in the above examples do 
not need any further illustrations or more explicit statement 

 the laws of the expression of propositions may now be exhibited and 
studied in the distinct cases in which they present themselves there is how 
ever one principle of fundamental importance to which i wish in the first place 
to direct attention although the principles of expression which have been laid 
down are perfectly general and enable us to limit our assertions of the truth 
or falsehood of propositions to any particular portions of that whole of time 



chapter xl of secondary propositions 


 


whether it be an unlimited eternity or a period whose beginning and whose 
end are definitely fixed or the passing moment which constitutes the universe 
of our discourse yet in the actual procedure of human reasoning such limi 
tation is not commonly employed when we assert that a proposition is true 
we generally mean that it is true throughout the whole duration of the time to 
which our discourse refers and when different assertions of the unconditional 
truth or falsehood of propositions are jointly made as the premises of a logical 
demonstration it is to the same universe of time that those assertions are re 
ferred and not to particular and limited parts of it in that necessary matter 
which is the object or field of the exact sciences every assertion of a truth may 
be the assertion of an “eternal truth” in reasoning upon transient phaenomena 
as of some social conjuncture each assertion may be qualified by an immediate 
reference to the present time “now” but in both cases unless there is a dis 
tinct expression to the contrary it is to the same period of duration that each 
separate proposition relates the cases which then arise for our consideration 
are the following 

st to express the proposition “the proposition x is true ” 

we are here required to express that within those limits of time to which 
the matter of our discourse is confined the proposition x is true now the time 
for which the proposition x is true is denoted by x and the extent of time to 
which our discourse refers is represented by hence we have 

x 

as the expression required 

nd to express the proposition “the proposition x is false ” 

we are here to express that within the limits of time to which our discourse 
relates the proposition x is false or that within those limits there is no portion 
of time for which it is true now the portion of time for which it is true is x 
hence the required equation will be 


x 

this result might also be obtained by equating to the whole duration of time 
 the expression for the time during which the proposition x is false viz — x 
this gives 


 — x 

whence x 

rd to express the disjunctive proposition “either the proposition x is true 
or the proposition y is true” it being thereby implied that the said propositions 
are mutually exclusive that is to say that one only of them is true 

the time for which either the proposition x is true or the proposition y is 
true but not both is represented by the expression xl — y y — x hence 
we have 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


xl y yl x 

for the equation required 

if in the above proposition the particles either or are supposed not to pos 
sess an absolutely disjunctive power so that the possibility of the simultaneous 
truth of the propositions x and y is not excluded we must add to the first 
member of the above equations the term xy we shall thus have 


xy xl y xy 

or x — xy 

th to express the conditional proposition “if the proposition y is true 
the proposition x is true ” 

since whenever the proposition y is true the proposition x is true it is 
necessary and sufficient here to express that the time in which the proposition 
y is true is time in which the proposition x is true that is to say that it is 
some indefinite portion of the whole time in which the proposition x is true 
now the time in which the proposition y is true is y and the whole time in 
which the proposition x is true is x let v be a symbol of time indefinite then 
will vx represent an indefinite portion of the whole time x accordingly we 
shall have 


y vx 

as the expression of the proposition given 

 when v is thus regarded as a symbol of time indefinite vx may be 
understood to represent the whole or an indefinite part or no part of the 
whole time x for any one of these meanings may be realized by a particular 
determination of the arbitrary symbol v thus if v be determined to represent 
a time in which the whole time x is included vx will represent the whole time 
x if v be determined to represent a time some part of which is included in the 
time x but which does not fill up the measure of that time vx will represent a 
part of the time x if lastly v is determined to represent a time of which no 
part is common with any part of the time x vx will assume the value and 
will be equivalent to “no time” or “never” 

now it is to be observed that the proposition “if y is true x is true” 
contains no assertion of the truth of either of the propositions x and y it 
may equally consist with the supposition that the truth of the proposition y is 
a condition indispensable to the truth of the proposition x in which case we 
shall have v or with the supposition that although y expresses a condition 
which when realized assures us of the truth of x yet x may be true without 
implying the fulfilment of that condition in which case v denotes a time some 
part of which is contained in the whole time x or lastly with the supposition 
that the proposition y is not true at all in which case v represents some time 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


no part of which is common with any part of the time x all these cases are 
involved in the general supposition that v is a symbol of time indefinite 

th to express a proposition in which the conditional and the disjunctive 
characters both exist 

the general form of a conditional proposition is “if y is true x is true” 
and its expression is by the last section y vx we may properly in analogy 
with the usage which has been established in primary propositions designate 
y and x as the terms of the conditional proposition into which they enter and 
we may further adopt the language of the ordinary logic which designates the 
term y to which the particle if is attached the “antecedent” of the proposition 
and the term x the “consequent” 

now instead of the terms as in the above case being simple propositions 
let each or either of them be a disjunctive proposition involving different terms 
connected by the particles either or as in the following illustrative examples 
in which x y z c denote simple propositions 

st if either x is true or y is true then z is true 

nd if x is true then either y is true or z true 

rd if either x is true or y is true then either z and w are both true or 
they are both false 

it is evident that in the above cases the relation of the antecedent to the 
consequent is not affected by the circumstance that one of those terms or both 
are of a disjunctive character accordingly it is only necessary to obtain in 
conformity with the principles already established the proper expressions for 
the antecedent and the consequent to affect the latter with the indefinite symbol 
v and to equate the results thus for the propositions above stated we shall 
have the respective equations 


st xl — y — xy vz 

nd a vy — z z — y 

rdxl — y y — x vzw — z — tu 

the rule here exemplified is of general application 

cases in which the disjunctive and the conditional elements enter in a manner 
different from the above into the expression of a compound proposition are 
conceivable but i am not aware that they are ever presented to us by the natural 
exigencies of human reason and i shall therefore refrain from any discussion of 
them no serious difficulty will arise from this omission as the general principles 
which have formed the basis of the above applications are perfectly general and 
a slight effort of thought will adapt them to any imaginable case 

 in the laws of expression above stated those of interpretation are implic 
itly involved the equation 

x 

must be understood to express that the proposition x is true the equation 

x 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


that the proposition x is false the equation 

xy l 

will express that the propositions x and y are both true together and the 
equation 

xy 

that they are not both together true 

in like manner the equations 


xl y x 
xl y yl x 

will respectively assert the truth and the falsehood of the disjunctive propo 
sition “either x is true or y is true” the equations 


y vx 
y vlx 

will respectively express the propositions “if the proposition y is true the 
proposition x is true” “if the proposition y is true the proposition x is false” 

examples will frequently present themselves in the succeeding chapters of 
this work of a case in which some terms of a particular member of an equation 
are affected by the indefinite symbol v and others not so affected the following 
instance will serve for illustration suppose that we have 

y xz vxl — z 

here it is implied that the time for which the proposition y is true consists 
of all the time for which x and z are together true together with an indefinite 
portion of the time for which x is true and z false from this it may be seen 
st that if y is true either x and z are together true or x is true and z 
false ndly if x and z are together true y is true the latter of these may 
be called the reverse interpretation and it consists in taking the antecedent 
out of the second member and the consequent from the first member of the 
equation the existence of a term in the second member whose coefficient is 
unity renders this latter mode of interpretation possible the general principle 
which it involves may be thus stated 

 principletny constituent term or terms in a particular member of an 
equation which have for their coefficient unity may be taken as the antecedent of 
a proposition of which all the terms in the other member form the consequent 

thus the equation 


y xz vxl — z — xl — z 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


would have the following interpretations 

direct interpretation the proposition y is true then either x and 
z are true or x is true and z false or x and z are both false 

reverse interpretation either x and z are true or x and z are 
false y is true 

the aggregate of these partial interpretations will express the whole signifi 
cance of the equation given 

 we may here call attention again to the remark that although the idea 
of time appears to be an essential element in the theory of the interpretation 
of secondary propositions it may practically be neglected as soon as the laws 
of expression and of interpretation are definitely established the forms to 
which those laws give rise seem indeed to correspond with the forms of a 
perfect language let us imagine any known or existing language freed from 
idioms and divested of superfluity and let us express in that language any given 
proposition in a manner the most simple and literal the most in accordance 
with those principles of pure and universal thought upon which all languages 
are founded of which all bear the manifestation but from which all have more 
or less departed the transition from such a language to the notation of analysis 
would consist of no more than the substitution of one set of signs for another 
without essential change either of form or character for the elements whether 
things or propositions among which relation is expressed we should substitute 
letters for the disjunctive conjunction we should write for the connecting 
copula or sign of relatioin we should write this analogy i need not pursue 
its reality and completeness will be made more apparent from the study of those 
forms of expression which will present themselves in subsequent applications of 
the present theory viewed in more immediate comparison with that imperfect 
yet noble instrument of thoughtthe english language 

 upon the general analogy between the theory of primary and that of 
secondary propositions i am desirous of adding a few remarks before dismissing 
the subject of the present chapter 

we might undoubtedly have established the theory of primary propositions 
upon the simple notion of space in the same way as that of secondary propo 
sitions has been established upon the notion of time perhaps had this been 
done the analogy which we are contemplating would have been in somewhat 
closer accordance with the view of those who regard space and time as merely 
“forms of the human understanding” conditions of knowledge imposed by the 
very constitution of the mind upon all that is submitted to its apprehension 
but this view while on the one hand it is incapable of demonstration on the 
other hand ties us down to the recognition of “place” to tco’v as an essential 
category of existence the question indeed whether it is so or not lies i ap 
prehend beyond the reach of our faculties but it may be and i conceive has 
been established that the formal processes of reasoning in primary proposi 
tions do not require as an essential condition the manifestation in space of the 
things about which we reason that they would remain applicable with equal 
strictness of demonstration to forms of existence if such there be which lie 
beyond the realm of sensible extension it is a fact perhaps in some degree 



chapter xi of secondary propositions 


 


analogous to this that we are able in many known examples in geometry and 
dynamics to exhibit the formal analysis of problems founded upon some intel 
lectual conception of space different from that which is presented to us by the 
senses or which can be realized by the imagination i conceive therefore 
that the idea of space is not essential to the development of a theory of primary 
propositions but am disposed though desiring to speak with diffidence upon 
a question of such extreme difficulty to think that the idea of time is essen 
tial to the establishment of a theory of secondary propositions there seem to 
be grounds for thinking that without any change in those faculties which are 
concerned in reasoning the manifestation of space to the human mind might 
have been different from what it is but not at least the same grounds for 
supposing that the manifestation of time could have been otherwise than we 
perceive it to be dismissing however these speculations as possibly not al 
together free from presumption let it be affirmed that the real ground upon 
which the symbol represents in primary propositions the universe of things 
and not the space they occupy is that the sign of identity connecting the 
members of the corresponding equations implies that the things which they 
represent are identical not simply that they are found in the same portion of 
space let it in like manner be affirmed that the reason why the symbol in 
secondary propositions represents not the universe of events but the eternity 
in whose successive moments and periods they are evolved is that the same 
sign of identity connecting the logical members of the corresponding equations 
implies not that the events which those members represent are identical but 
that the times of their occurrence are the same these reasons appear to me 
to be decisive of the immediate question of interpretation in a former treatise 
on this subject mathematical analysis of logic p following the theory 
of wallis respecting the reduction of hypothetical propositions i was led to 
interpret the symbol in secondary propositions as the universe of “cases” or 
“conjunctures of circumstances” but this view involves the necessity of a defi 
nition of what is meant by a “case” or “conjuncture of circumstances” and it 
is certain that whatever is involved in the term beyond the notion of time is 
alien to the objects and restrictive of the processes of formal logic 


 space is presented to us in perception as possessing the three dimensions of length 
breadth and depth but in a large class of problems relating to the properties of curved 
surfaces the rotations of solid bodies around axes the vibrations of elastic media c this 
limitation appears in the analytical investigation to be of an arbitrary character and if at 
tention were paid to the processes of solution alone no reason could be discovered why space 
should not exist in four or in any greater number of dimensions the intellectual procedure 
in the imaginary world thus suggested can be apprehended by the clearest light of analogy 

the existence of space in three dimensions and the views thereupon of the religious and 
philosophical mind of antiquity are thus set forth by aristotle— meyedoc e to pev etp ev

chapter xii 

of the methods and processes to be 
adopted in the treatment of secondary 
propositions 


 it has appeared from previous researches xi that the laws of combina 
tion of the literal symbols of logic are the same whether those symbols are 
employed in the expression of primary or in that of secondary propositions the 
sole existing difference between the two cases being a difference of interpretation 
it has also been established v that whenever distinct systems of thought 
and interpretation are connected with the same system of formal laws ie of 
laws relating to the combination and use of symbols the attendant processes 
intermediate between the expression of the primary conditions of a problem and 
the interpretation of its symbolical solution are the same in both hence as 
between the systems of thought manifested in the two forms of primary and 
of secondary propositions this community of formal law exists the processes 
which have been established and illustrated in our discussion of the former class 
of propositions will without any modification be applicable to the latter 

 thus the laws of the two fundamental processes of elimination and de 
velopment are the same in the system of secondary as in the system of primary 
propositions again it has been seen chap vi prop how in primary 
propositions the interpretation of any proposed equation devoid of fractional 
forms may be effected by developing it into a series of constituents and equat 
ing to every constituent whose coefficient does not vanish to the equations 
of secondary propositions the same method is applicable and the interpreted 
result to which it finally conducts us is as in the former case vi a system 
of coexistent denials but while in the former case the force of those denials is 
expended upon the existence of certain classes of things in the latter it relates 
to the truth of certain combinations of the elementary propositions involved in 
the terms of the given premises and as in primary propositions it was seen 
that the system of denials admitted of conversion into various other forms of 
propositions vi c such conversion will be found to be possible here also 
the sole difference consisting not in the forms of the equations but in the nature 
of their interpretation 

 moreover as in primary propositions we can find the expression of any 


 



chapter xii methods in secondary propositions 


 


element entering into a system of equations in terms of the remaining elements 
vi or of any selected number of the remaining elements and interpret 
that expression into a logical inference the same object can be accomplished 
by the same means difference of interpretation alone excepted in the system of 
secondary propositions the elimination of those elements which we desire to 
banish from the final solution the reduction of the system to a single equation 
the algebraic solution and the mode of its development into an interpretable 
form differ in no respect from the corresponding steps in the discussion of 
primary propositions 

to remove however any possible difficulty it may be desirable to collect un 
der a general rule the different cases which present themselves in the treatment 
of secondary propositions 

rule express symbolically the given propositions xi 

eliminate separately from each equation in which it is found the indefinite 
symbol v vii 

eliminate the remaining symbols which it is desired to banish from the final 
solution always before elimination ’ reducing to a single equation those equations 
in which the symbol or symbols to be eliminated are found viii collect the 
resulting equations into a single equation v 

then proceed according to the particular form in which it is desired to express 
the final relation as 

lst if in the form of a denial or system of denials develop the function v 
and equate to all those constituents whose coefficients do not vanish 

ndly if in the form of a disjunctive proposition equate to the sum of 
those constituents whose coefficients vanish 

rdly if in the form of a conditional proposition having a simple element as 
x or l — ai for its antecedent determine the algebraic expression of that element 
and develop that expression 

thly if in the form of a conditional proposition having a compound expres 
sion as xy xy — xl — y c for its antecedent equate that expression 
to a new symbol t and determine t as a developed function of the symbols which 
are to appear in the consequent either by ordinary methods or by the special 
method ix 

thly interpret the results by xi 

if it only be desired to ascertain whether a particular elementary proposition 
x is true or false we must eliminate all the symbols but x then the equation 
x will indicate that the proposition is true x that it is false that 
the premises are insufficient to determine whether it is true or false 

 ex lthe following prediction is made the subject of a curious discussion 
in cicero’s fragmentary treatise de fato“si quis fabius natus est oriente 
canicula is in mari non morietur” i shall apply to it the method of this chapter 
let y represent the proposition “fabius was born at the rising of the dogstar” 
x the proposition “fabius will die in the sea” in saying that x represents the 
proposition “fabius c” it is only meant that a is a symbol so appropriated 
xi to the above proposition that the equation x declares and the 
equation x denies the truth of that proposition the equation we have to 



chapter xii methods in secondary propositions 


 


discuss will be 

y v lx 

and first let it be required to reduce the given proposition to a negation or 
system of negations xii we have on transposition 

y — vl — a 


eliminating v 


y y x 
or yy x 

or yx 

the interpretation of this result is“it is not true that fabius was born at 
the rising of the dogstar and will die in the sea” cicero terms this form of 
proposition “conjunctio ex repugnantibus” and he remarks that chrysippus 
thought in this way to evade the difficulty which he imagined to exist in con 
tingent assertions respecting the future “hoc loco chrysippus aestuans falli 
sperat chaldaeos casterosque di vinos neque eos usuros esse conjunctionibus ut 
ita sua percepta pronuntient si quis natus est oriente canicula is in mari non 
morietur sed potius ita dicant non et natus est quis oriente canicula et in 
mari morietur o licentiam jocularem multa genera sunt enuntiandi nec ul 
lum distortius quam hoc quo chrysippus sperat chaldaeos contentos stoicorum 
causa fore” cic de fato 

 to reduce the given proposition to a disjunctive form the constituents 
not entering into the first member of are 

x l x y al y 


whence we have 


ylx xly lxly l 

the interpretation of which is either fabius was born at the rising of the 
dogstar and will not perish in the sea or he was not born at the rising of 
the dogstar and will perish in the sea or he was not born at the rising of the 
dogstar and will not perish in the sea 

in cases like the above however in which there exist constituents differing 
from each other only by a single factor it is as we have seen vii most 
convenient to collect such constituents into a single term if we thus connect 
the first and third terms of we have 

 — y x — x 

and if we similarly connect the second and third we have 


 x y 



chapter xii methods in secondary propositions 


 


these forms of the equation severally give the interpretations 

either fabius was not born under the day star and will die in the sea or he 
will not die in the sea 

either fabius was born under the day star and will not die in the sea or he 
was not bom under the dogstar 

it is evident that these interpretations are strictly equivalent to the former 
one 

let us ascertain in the form of a conditional proposition the consequences 
which flow from the hypothesis that “fabius will perish in the sea” 

in the equation which expresses the result of the elimination of v from 
the original equation we must seek to determine a as a function of y 

we have 

x oy h — — y on expansion 

v 

or 

the interpretation of which is if fabius shall die in the sea he was not bom at 
the rising of the dogstar 

these examples serve in some measure to illustrate the connexion which 
has been established in the previous sections between primary and secondary 
propositions a connexion of which the two distinguishing features are identity 
of process and analogy of interpretation 

 ex there is a remarkable argument in the second book of the republic 
of plato the design of which is to prove the immutability of the divine nature 
it is a very fine example both of the careful induction from familiar instances by 
which plato arrives at general principles and of the clear and connected logic 
by which he deduces from them the particular inferences which it is his object 
to establish the argument is contained in the following dialogue 

“must not that which departs from its proper form be changed either by itself 
or by another thing necessarily so are not things which are in the best state 
least changed and disturbed as the body by meats and drinks and labours 
and every species of plant by heats and winds and such like affections is not 
the healthiest and strongest the least changed assuredly and does not any 
trouble from without least disturb and change that soul which is strongest and 
wisest and as to all made vessels and furnitures and garments according 
to the same principle are not those which are well wrought and in a good 
condition least changed by time and other accidents even so and whatever 
is in a right state either by nature or by art or by both these admits of the 
smallest change from any other thing so it seems but god and things divine 
are in every sense in the best state assuredly in this way then god should 
least of all bear many forms least indeed of all again should he transform 
and change himself manifestly he must do so if he is changed at all changes 
he then himself to that which is more good and fair or to that which is worse 
and baser necessarily to the worse if he be changed for never shall we say 
that god is indigent of beauty or of virtue you speak most rightly said i and 



chapter xii methods in secondary propositions 


 


the matter being so seems it to you adimantus that god or man willingly 
makes himself in any sense worse impossible said he impossible then it is 
said i that a god should wish to change himself but ever being fairest and best 
each of them ever remains absolutely in the same form” 

the premises of the above argument are the following 

st if the deity suffers change he is changed either by himself or by 
another 

nd if he is in the best state he is not changed by another 

rd the deity is in the best state 

th if the deity is changed by himself he is changed to a worse state 

th if he acts willingly he is not changed to a worse state 

th the deity acts willingly 

let us express the elements of these premises as follows 

let x represent the proposition “the deity suffers change” 

y he is changed by himself 

z he is changed by another 

s he is in the best state 

t he is changed to a worse state 

w he acts willingly 

then the premises expressed in symbolical language yield after elimination 
of the indefinite class symbols v the following equations 


y iz o 

 

sz 

 

s 

 

o 

ii 

ho 

 

r— 

 

wt 

 

w 

 


retaining x i shall eliminate in succession z s y t and w this being the 
order in which those symbols occur in the above system and interpret the 
successive results 

eliminating z from and we get 


xs — y 

 

eliminating s from and 


xi y o 

 

eliminating y from and 


xl — t 

 

eliminating t from and 


xw 

 



chapter xii methods in secondary propositions 


 


eliminating w from and 

a 

these equations beginning with give the following results 

from we have x j y therefore if the deity suffers change he is 
changed by himself 

from x jji if the deity suffers change he is changed to a worse 
state 

from x — w if the deity suffers change he does not act 
willingly 

from the deity does not suffer change this is plato’s result 

now i have before remarked that the order of elimination is indifferent let 
us in the present case seek to verify this fact by eliminating the same symbols 
in a reverse order beginning with w the resulting equations are 

t y xl — x z x 

yielding the following interpretations 

god is not changed to a worse state he is not changed by himself if he 
suffers change he is changed by another he is not changed by another he is 
not changed 

we thus reach by a different route the same conclusion 

though as an exhibition of the power of the method the above examples 
are of slight value they serve as well as more complicated instances would do 
to illustrate its nature and character 

 it may be remarked as a final instance of analogy between the system of 
primary and that of secondary propositions that in the latter system also the 
fundamental equation 

xl — x 

admits of interpretation it expresses the axiom a proposition cannot at the 
same time be true and false let this be compared with the corresponding 
interpretation iii solved under the form 

 

x z n i 

 — x 

by development it furnishes the respective axioms “a thing is what it is” “if 
a proposition is true it is true” forms of what has been termed “the principle 
of identity” upon the nature and the value of these axioms the most opposite 
opinions have been entertained some have regarded them as the very pith and 
marrow of philosophy locke devoted to them a chapter headed “on trifling 
propositions” in both these views there seems to have been a mixture of 
truth and error regarded as supplanting experience or as furnishing materials 
for the vain and wordy janglings of the schools such propositions are worse than 
trifling viewed on the other hand as intimately allied with the very laws and 
conditions of thought they rise into at least a speculative importance

chapter xiii 

analysis of a portion of dr samuel 
clarke’s “demonstration of the being and 
attributes of god” and of a portion of 
the “ethica ordine geometrico 
demonstrata” of spinoza 


 the general order which in the investigations of the following chapter 
i design to pursue is the following i shall examine what are the actual 
premises involved in the demonstrations of some of the general propositions 
of the above treatises whether those premises be expressed or implied by the 
actual premises i mean whatever propositions are assumed in the course of the 
argument without being proved and are employed as parts of the foundation 
upon which the final conclusion is built the premises thus determined i shall 
express in the language of symbols and i shall then deduce from them by the 
methods developed in the previous chapters of this work the most important 
inferences which they involve in addition to the particular inferences actually 
drawn by the authors i shall in some instances modify the premises by the omis 
sion of some fact or principle which is contained in them or by the addition or 
substitution of some new proposition and shall determine how by such change 
the ultimate conclusions are affected in the pursuit of these objects it will not 
devolve upon me to inquire except incidentally how far the metaphysical prin 
ciples laid down in these celebrated productions are worthy of confidence but 
only to ascertain what conclusions may justly be drawn from given premises 
and in doing this to exemplify the perfect liberty which we possess as concerns 
both the choice and the order of the elements of the final or concluding propo 
sitions viz as to determining what elementary propositions are true or false 
and what are true or false under given restrictions or in given combinations 

 the chief practical difficulty of this inquiry will consist not in the ap 
plication of the method to the premises once determined but in ascertaining 
what the premises are in what area regarded as the most rigorous examples of 
reasoning applied to metaphysical questions it will occasionally be found that 
different trains of thought are blended together that particular but essential 
parts of the demonstration are given parenthetically or out of the main course 


 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


of the argument that the meaning of a premiss may be in some degree am 
biguous and not unfrequently that arguments viewed by the strict laws of 
formal reasoning are incorrect or inconclusive the difficulty of determining 
and distinctly exhibiting the true premises of a demonstration may 

in such cases be very considerable but it is a difficulty which must be 
overcome by all who would ascertain whether a particular conclusion is proved 
or not whatever form they may be prepared or disposed to give to the ulterior 
process of reasoning it is a difficulty therefore which is not peculiar to the 
method of this work though it manifests itself more distinctly in connexion with 
this method than with any other so intimate indeed is this connexion that it 
is impossible employing the method of this treatise to form even a conjecture 
as to the validity of a conclusion without a distinct apprehension and exact 
statement of all the premises upon which it rests in the more usual course 
of procedure nothing is however more common than to examine some of the 
steps of a train of argument and thence to form a vague general impression of 
the scope of the whole without any such preliminary and thorough analysis of 
the premises which it involves 

the necessity of a rigorous determination of the real premises of a demon 
stration ought not to be regarded as an evil especially as when that task is 
accomplished every source doubt or ambiguity is removed in employing the 
method of this treatise the order in which premises are arranged the mode of 
connexion which they exhibit with every similar circumstance may be esteemed 
a matter of indifference and the process inference is conducted with a precision 
which might almost termed mechanical 

 the “demonstration of the being and attributes of god” consists of a 
series of propositions or theorems each of them proved by means of premises 
resolvable for the most part into two distinct classes viz facts of observation 
such as the existence of a material world the phenomenon of motion c and 
hypothetical principles the authority and universality of which are supposed 
to be recognised a priori it is of course upon the truth of the latter as 
suming the correctness of the reasoning that the validity of the demonstration 
really depends but whatever may be thought of its claims in this respect it 
is unquestionable that as an intellectual performance its merits are very high 
though the trains of argument of which it consists are not in general very clearly 
arranged they are almost always specimens of correct logic and they exhibit 
a subtlety of apprehension and a force of reasoning which have seldom been 
equalled never perhaps surpassed we see in them the consummation of those 
intellectual efforts which were awakened in the realm of metaphysical inquiry 
at a period when the dominion of hypothetical principles was less questioned 
than it now is and when the rigorous demonstrations of the newly risen school 
of mathematical physics seemed to have furnished a model for their direction 
they appear to me for this reason not to mention the dignity of the subject of 
which they treat to be deserving of high consideration and i do not deem it a 
vain or superfluous task to expend upon some of them a careful analysis 

 the ethics of benedict spinoza is a treatise the object of which is to 
prove the identity of god and the universe and to establish upon this doctrine 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


a system of morals and of philosophy the analysis of its main argument is 
extremely difficult owing not to the complexity of the separate propositions 
which it involves but to the use of vague definitions and of axioms which 
through a like defect of clearness it is perplexing to determine whether we 
ought to accept or to reject while the reasoning of dr samuel clarke is in 
part verbal that of spinoza is so in a much greater degree and perhaps this 
is the reason why to some minds it has appeared to possess a formal cogency 
to which in reality it possesses no just claim these points will however be 
considered in the proper place 

clarke’s demonstration 

proposition i 

 something has existed from eternity 

the proof is as follows 

“for since something now is ’tis manifest that something always was oth 
erwise the things that now are must have risen out of nothing absolutely and 
without cause which is a plain contradiction in terms for to say a thing is 
produced and yet that there is no cause at all of that production is to say that 
something is effected when it is effected by nothing that is at the same time 
when it is not effected at all whatever exists has a cause of its existence either 
in the necessity of its own nature and thus it must have been of itself eternal 
or in the will of some other being and then that other being must at least in 
the order of nature and causality have existed before it” 

let us now proceed to analyze the above demonstration its first sentence 
is resolvable into the following propositions 

st something is 

nd if something is either something always was or the things that now 
are must have risen out of nothing 

the next portion of the demonstration consists of a proof that the second of 
the above alternatives viz “the things that now are have risen out of nothing” 
is impossible and it may formally be resolved as follows 

rd if the things that now are have risen out of nothing something has been 
effected and at the same time that something has been effected by nothing 

th if that something has been effected by nothing it has not been effected 
at all 

the second portion of this argument appears to be a mere assumption of 
the point to be proved or an attempt to make that point clearer by a different 
verbal statement 

the third and last portion of the demonstration contains a distinct proof 
of the truth of either the original proposition to be proved viz “something 
always was” or the point proved in the second part of the demonstration viz 
the untenable nature of the hypothesis that “the things that now are have risen 
out of nothing” it is resolvable as follows 

th if something is either it exists by the necessity of its own nature or it 
exists by the will of another being 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


th if it exists by the necessity of its own nature something always was 

th if it exists by the will of another being then the proposition that the 
things which exist have arisen out of nothing is false 

the last proposition is not expressed in the same form in the text of dr 
clarke but his expressed conclusion of the prior existence of another being is 
clearly meant as equivalent to a denial of the proposition that the things which 
now are have risen out of nothing 

it appears therefore that the demonstration consists of two distinct trains 
of argument one of those trains comprising what i have designated as the first 
and second parts of the demonstration the other comprising the first and third 
parts let us consider the latter train 

the premises are 

lst something is 

nd if something is either something always was or the things that now 
are have risen out of nothing 

rd if something is either it exists in the necessity of its own nature or it 
exists by the will of another being 

th if it exists in the necessity of its own nature something always was 

th if it exists by the will of another being then the hypothesis that the 
things which now are have risen out of nothing is false 

we must now express symbolically the above proposition 

let 

x something is 

y something always was 

z the things which now are have risen from nothing 

p it exists in the necessity of its own nature 
ie the something spoken of above 

q it exists by the will of another being 

it must be understood that by the expression let x “something is” is 
meant no more than that x is the representative symbol of that proposition xi 
 the equations x x respectively declaring its truth and its falsehood 

the equations of the premises are 
st x 

nd x vy — x z — j 

rd x vpl — q ql — p 

th p vy 

th q vl — z 

and on eliminating the several indefinite symbols v we have 


 — x — 

 

yz yl z 

 

¦pq pl 

 

 

 

ii 

o 

 

qz 

 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


 first i shall examine whether any conclusions are deducible from the 
above concerning the truth or falsity of the single propositions represented by 
the symbols y z p q viz of the propositions “something always was” “the 
things which now are have risen from nothing” “the something which is exists 
by the necessity of its own nature” “the something which is exists by the will 
of another being” 

for this purpose we must separately eliminate all the symbols but y all these 
but z c the resulting equation will determine whether any such separate 
relations exist 

to eliminate x from and it is only necessary to substitute in 
 and the value of x derived from we find as the results 


yz y z 
pq lpl q 

to eliminate p we have from and by addition 

p i ypq pq o 

whence we find 


lylq 

to eliminate q from and we have 

qz yl q 

whence we find 


 

 

 

 


xly 

there now remain but the two equations and which on addition 
give 


yz ly 

eliminating from this equation z we have 

 y or y 

eliminating from the same equation y we have 

z 

the interpretation of is 
something always was 

the interpretation of is 

the things which are have not risen from nothing 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


next resuming the system with the two equations let us 
determine the two equations involving p and q respectively 

to eliminate y we have from and 

pi y v z ji z o 

whence 


p — zz or pz 
to eliminate z from and we have 


whence we get 


qz pz 


 


 

there remains then but the equation from which eliminating q we have 
 for the final equation in p 

hence there is no conclusion derivable from the premises affirming the simple 
truth or falsehood of the proposition “the something which is exists in the 
necessity of its own nature ” and as on eliminating p there is the same result 
 for the ultimate equation in q it also follows that there is no conclusion 
deducible from the premises as to the simple truth or falsehood of the proposition 
“the something which is exists by the will of another being ” 

of relations connecting more than one of the propositions represented by the 
elementary symbols it is needless to consider any but that which is denoted by 
the equation connecting p and q inasmuch as the propositions represented 
by the remaining symbols are absolutely true or false independently of any 
connexion of the kind here spoken of the interpretation of placed under 
the form 


p i q p is 

the something which is either exists in the necessity of its own nature or 
by the will of another being 

i have exhibited the details of the above analysis with a perhaps needless 
fulness and prolixity because in the examples which will follow i propose rather 
to indicate the steps by which results are obtained than to incur the danger of 
a wearisome frequency of repetition the conclusions which have resulted from 
the above application of the method are easily verified by ordinary reasoning 

the reader will have no difficulty in applying the method to the other train 
of premises involved in dr clarke’s first proposition and deducing from them 
the two first of the conclusions to which the above analysis has led 


proposition ii 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


 some one unchangeable and independent being has existed from eternity 

the premises from which the above proposition is prove are the following 

st something has always existed 

nd if something has always existed either there has existed some one 
unchangeable and independent being or the whole of existing things has been 
comprehended in a succession of changeable and dependent beings 

rd if the universe has consisted of a succession of changeable and dependent 
beings either that series has had a cause from without or it has had a cause 
from within 

th it has not had a cause from without because it includes by hypothesis 
all things that exist 

th it has not had a cause from within because no part is necessary and 
if no part is necessary the whole cannot be necessary 

omitting merely for brevity the subsidiary proofs contained in the paren 
theses of the fourth and fifth premiss we may represent the premises as follows 


let x 

v 

z 

p 

q 


something has always existed 

there has existed some one unchangeable and independent being 
there has existed a succession of changeable and dependent beings 
that series has had a cause from without 

that series has had a cause from within 


then we have the following system of equations viz 


st x 
nd x 
rd z 
th p 
th q 


i 

vyl z z y 

vp i q i pq 
 


 


which on the separate elimination of the indefinite symbols v gives 


l — x 

 

xyz yl z 

 

zpq pl q 

 

p 

 

q 

 


the elimination from the above system of x p q and y conducts to the 
equation 


z 


and the elimination of x p q and z conducts in a similar manner to the 
equation 


y i 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


of which equations the respective interpretations are 

st the whole of existing things has not been comprehended in a succession 
of changeable and dependent beings 

nd there has existed some one unchangeable and independent being 

the latter of these is the proposition which dr clarke proves as by the 
above analysis all the propositions represented by the literal symbols x y z 
p q are determined as absolutely true or false it is needless to inquire into the 
existence of any further relations connecting those propositions together 

another proof is given of prop ii which for brevity i pass over it may be 
observed that the “impossibility of infinite succession” the proof of which forms 
a part of clarke’s argument has commonly been assumed as a fundamental 
principle of metaphysics and extended to other questions than that of causation 
aristotle applies it to establish the necessity of first principles of demonstration 
 the necessity of an end the good in human actions c there is perhaps 
no principle more frequently referred to in his writings by the schoolmen it 
was similarly applied to prove the impossibility of an infinite subordination of 
genera and species and hence the necessary existence of universals apparently 
the impossibility of our forming a definite and complete conception of an infinite 
series ie of comprehending it as a whole has been confounded with a logical 
inconsistency or contradiction in the idea itself 

 the analysis of the following argument depends upon the theory of pri 
mary propositions 

proposition iii 

that unchangeable and independent being must be self existent 

the premises are 

 every being must either have come into existence out of nothing or it 
must have been produced by some external cause or it must be selfexistent 

 no being has come into existence out of nothing 

 the unchangeable and independent being has not been produced by an 
external cause 

for the symbolical expression of the above let us assume 


x beings which have arisen out of nothing 
y beings which have been produced by an external cause 
z beings which are selfexistent 
w the unchangeable and independent being 

then we have 

xl y z yl ® z z xl yl 

 

w vly 

 metaphysics iii anal post i et seq 

 nic ethics book i cap ii 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


from the last of which eliminating v 

wy 

whenever as above the value of a symbol is given as or it is best 
eliminated by simple substitution thus the elimination of x gives 


yl z zl y 

or yz yl z 

now adding and and eliminating y we get 


 

 


wl — z 
w vz 

the interpretation of which is the unchangeable and independent being is 
necessarily self existing 

of in its actual form the interpretation is every being has either been 
produced by an external cause or it is selfexistent 

 in dr samuel clarke’s observations on the above proposition occurs a 
remarkable argument designed to prove that the material world is not the self 
existent being above spoken of the passage to which i refer is the following 

“if matter be supposed to exist necessarily then in that necessary existence 
there is either included the power of gravitation or not if not then in a world 
merely material and in which no intelligent being presides there never could 
have been any motion because motion as has been already shown and is now 
granted in the question is not necessary of itself but if the power of gravitation 
be included in the pretended necessary existence of matter then it following 
necessarily that there must be a vacuum as the incomparable sir isaac newton 
has abundantly demonstrated that there must if gravitation be an universal 
quality or affection of matter it follows likewise that matter is not a necessary 
being for if a vacuum actually be then it is plainly more than possible for 
matter not to be”pp 

it will upon attentive examination be found that the actual premises in 
volved in the above demonstration are the following 

st if matter is a necessary being either the property of gravitation is 
necessarily present or it is necessarily absent 

nd if gravitation is necessarily absent and the world is not subject to any 
presiding intelligence motion does not exist 

rd if the property of gravitation is necessarily present existence of a 
vacuum is necessary 

th if the existence of a vacuum is necessary matter is not necessary being 

th if matter is a necessary being the world is not subject to a presiding 
intelligence 

th motion exists 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


of the above premises the first four are expressed in the demonstration the 
fifth is implied in the connexion of its first and second sentences and the sixth 
expresses a fact which the author does not appear to have thought it necessary 
to state but which is obviously a part of the ground of his reasoning let us 
represent the elementary propositions in the following manner 


let x 

y 

t 

z 

w 

v 


matter is a necessary being 

gravitation is necessarily present 

gravitation is necessarily absent 

the world is merely material and not subject to any presiding intelligence 
motion exists 

a vacuum is necessary 


then the system of premises will be represented by the following equations 
in which q is employed as the symbol of time indefinite 


x qylt lyt 
tz q — w 

y qv 
v ql — x 
x qz 
w 

from which if we eliminate the symbols q we have the following system 


viz 

xyt l yl 

tzw 

 v 

vx 

xl — z 

 w 


now if from these equations we eliminate w v z y and t we obtain the 
equation 

x 

which expresses the proposition matter is not a necessary being this is dr 
clarke’s conclusion if we endeavour to eliminate any other set of five symbols 
except the set v z y t and x which would give w we obtain a result 
of the form it hence appears that there are no other conclusions ex 
pressive of the absolute truth or falsehood of any of the elementary propositions 
designated by single symbols 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


of conclusions expressed by equations involving two symbols there exists 
but the following viz if the world is merely material and not subject to a 
presiding intelligence gravitation is not necessarily absent this conclusion is 
expressed by the equation 

tz whence z q — t 

if in the above analysis we suppress the concluding premiss expressing the 
fact of the existence of motion and leave the hypothetical principles which are 
embodied in the remaining premises untouched some remarkable conclusions 
follow to these i shall direct attention in the following chapter 

 of the remainder of dr clarke’s argument i shall briefly state the 
substance and connexion dwelling only on certain portions of it which are of a 
more complex character than the others and afford better illustrations of the 
method of this work 

in prop iv it is shown that the substance or essence of the selfexistent 
being is incomprehensible the tenor of the reasoning employed is that we are 
ignorant of the essential nature of all other things much more then of the 
essence of the selfexistent being 

in prop v it is contended that “though the substance or essence of the 
selfexistent being is itself absolutely incomprehensible to us yet many of the 
essential attributes of his nature are strictly demonstrable as well as his exis 
tence” 

in prop vi it is argued that “the selfexistent being must of necessity be 
infinite and omnipresent” and it is contended that his infinity must be “an 
infinity of fulness as well as of immensity” the ground upon which the demon 
stration proceeds is that an absolute necessity of existence must be independent 
of time place and circumstance free from limitation and therefore excluding 
all imperfection and hence it is inferred that the selfexistent being must be “a 
most simple unchangeable incorruptible being without parts figure motion 
or any other such properties as we find in matter” 

the premises actually employed may be exhibited as follows 

 if a finite being is selfexistent it is a contradiction to suppose it not to 
exist 

 a finite being may without contradiction be absent from one place 

 that which may without contradiction be absent from one place may 
without contradiction be absent from all places 

 that which may without contradiction be absent from all places may 
without contradiction be supposed not to exist 

let us assume 

x finite beings 

y things selfexistent 

 things which it is a contradiction to suppose not to exist 

w things which may be absent without contradiction from one place 

t things which without contradiction may be absent from every place 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 

we have on expressing the above and eliminating the indefinite symbols 

xy z 

xl w 

wlt 

tz 

eliminating in succession t w and z we get 


xy 
y 

the interpretation of which is whatever is selfexistent is infinite 

in prop vii it is argued that the selfexistent being must of necessity be 
one the order of the proof is that the selfexistent being is “necessarily exis 
tent” that “necessity absolute in itself is simple and uniform and without any 
possible difference or variety” that all “variety or difference of existence” im 
plies dependence and hence that “whatever exists necessarily is the one simple 
essence of the selfexistent being” 

the conclusion is also made to flow from the following premises — 

 if there are two or more necessary and independent beings either of them 
may be supposed to exist alone 

 if either may be supposed to exist alone it is not a contradiction to 
suppose the other not to exist 

 if it is not a contradiction to suppose this there are not two necessary 
and independent beings 

let us represent the elementary propositions as follows 

x there exist two necessary independent beings 

y either may be supposed to exist alone 

 it is not a contradiction to suppose the other not to exist 

we have then on proceeding as before 


y o 

 

y z 

 

zx 

 


eliminating y and z we have 


whence there do not exist two necessary and independent beings 

 to the premises upon which the two previous propositions rest it is well 
known that bishop butler who at the time of the publication of the “demon 
stration” was a student in a nonconformist academy made objection in some 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


celebrated letters which together with dr clarke’s replies to them are usually 
appended to editions of the work the real question at issue is the validity 
of the principle that “whatsoever is absolutely necessary at all is absolutely 
necessary in every part of space and in every point of duration” — a principle 
assumed in dr clarke’s reasoning and explicitly stated in his reply to butler’s 
first letter in his second communication butler says “i do not conceive that 
the idea of ubiquity is contained in the idea of selfexistence or directly follows 
from it any otherwise than as whatever exists must exist somewhere ” that 
is to say necessary existence implies existence in some part of space but not 
in every part it does not appear that dr clarke was ever able to dispose 
effectually of this objection the whole of the correspondence is extremely cu 
rious and interesting the objections of butler are precisely those which would 
occur to an acute mind impressed with the conviction that upon the sifting 
of first principles rather than upon any mechanical dexterity of reasoning the 
successful investigation of truth mainly depends and the replies of dr clarke 
although they cannot be admitted as satisfactory evince in a remarkable de 
gree that peculiar intellectual power which is manifest in the work from which 
the discussion arose 

 in prop viii it is argued that the selfexistent and original cause of all 
things must be an intelligent being 

the main argument adduced in support of this proposition is that as the 
cause is more excellent than the effect the selfexistent being as the cause and 
original of all things must contain in itself the perfections of all things and that 
intelligence is one of the perfections manifested in a part of the creation it is 
further argued that this perfection is not a modification of figure divisibility 
or any of the known properties of matter for these are not perfections but 
limitations to this is added the a posteriori argument from the manifestation 
of design in the frame of the universe 

there is appended however a distinct argument for the existence of an 
intelligent selfexistent being founded upon the phaenomenal existence of motion 
in the universe i shall briefly exhibit this proof and shall apply to it the method 
of the present treatise 

the argument omitting unimportant explanations is as follows 

”’tis evident there is some such a thing as motion in the world which 
either began at some time or other or was eternal if it began in time then the 
question is granted that the first cause is an intelligent being on the contrary 
if motion was eternal either it was eternally caused by some eternal intelligent 
being or it must of itself be necessary and selfexistent or else without any 
necessity in its own nature and without any external necessary cause it must 
have existed from eternity by an endless successive communication if motion 
was eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being this also is granting 
the question as to the present dispute if it was of itself necessary and self 
existent then it follows that it must be a contradiction in terms to suppose any 
matter to be at rest and yet at the same time because the determination 
of this selfexistent motion must be every way at once the effect of it would 
be nothing else but a perpetual rest but if it be said that motion without 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


any necessity in its own nature and without any external necessary cause has 
existed from eternity merely by an endless successive communication as spinoza 
inconsistently enough seems to assert this i have before shown in the proof of 
the second general proposition of this discourse to be a plain contradiction 
it remains therefore that motion must of necessity be originally caused by 
something that is intelligent” 

the premises of the above argument may be thus disposed 

 if motion began in time the first cause is an intelligent being if 
motion has existed from eternity either it has been eternally caused by some 
eternal intelligent being or it is selfexistent or it must have existed by endless 
successive communication 

 if motion has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being the 
first cause is an intelligent being 

 if it is selfexistent matter is at rest and not at rest 

 that motion has existed by endless successive communication and that 
at the same time it is not selfexistent and has not been eternally caused by 
some eternal intelligent being is false 

to express these propositions let us assume — 


x 

 — x 

y 

p 

q 

r 

s 


motion began in time and therefore 

motion has existed from eternity 

the first cause is an intelligent being 

motion has been eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being 
motion is selfexistent 

motion has existed by endless successive communication 

matter is at rest 


the equations of the premises then are — 


x vy 

 — x v p — q — r q — p — r r — p — q 
p vy 

q vs — s 
rlqlp 

since by the fourth equation q we obtain on substituting for q its value 
in the remaining equations the system 

x — vy — x v p — r r — p 

p vy r — p 

from which eliminating the indefinite symbols v we have the final reduced 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


system 


xi y o 

 

 x pr p r 

 

po y o 

 

r — p 

 

we shall first seek the value of y the symbol involved in dr 
first eliminating x from and we have 

clarke’s conclusion 

 ypr p r 

 


next to eliminate r from and we have 

rl p ypr pl r 
 p yp x yl p 


whence 

jp 

lastly eliminating p from and we have 

 

y i 

which expresses the required conclusion the first cause is an intelligent 
being 

let us now examine what other conclusions are deducible from the premises 
if we substitute the value just found for y in the equations 
they are reduced to the following pair of equations viz 

 — xpr l pl — r rl—p 

eliminating from these equations x we have 

rl — p whence r vp 

which expresses the conclusion if motion has existed by endless successive com 
munication it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being 

again eliminating from the given pair r we have 

 xl p 
or — x vp 

which expresses the conclusion if motion has existed from eternity it has been 
eternally caused by some eternal intelligent being 

lastly from the same original pair eliminating p we get 


 — xr 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


which solved in the form 

 — x r — r 

gives the conclusion if motion has existed from eternity it has not existed 
by an endless successive communication 

solved under the form 

r vx 

the above equation leads to the equivalent conclusion if motion exists by an 
endless successive communication it began in time 

 now it will appear to the reader that the first and last of the above 
four conclusions are inconsistent with each other the two consequences drawn 
from the hypothesis that motion exists by an endless successive communication 
viz st that it has been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being ndly 
that it began in time — are plainly at variance nevertheless they are both 
rigorous deductions from the original premises the opposition between them 
is not of a logical but of what is technically termed a material character this 
opposition might however have been formally stated in the premises we 
might have added to them a formal proposition asserting that “whatever is 
externally caused by an eternal intelligent being does not begin in time” had 
this been done no such opposition as now appears in our conclusions could 
have presented itself formal logic can only take account of relations which are 
formally expressed vi and it may thus in particular instances become 
necessary to express in a formal manner some connexion among the premises 
which without actual statement is involved in the very meaning of the language 
employed 

to illustrate what has been said let us add to the equations and the 
equation 

px 

which expresses the condition above adverted to we have 

 xpr p r r — p px 

eliminating p from this we find simply 

r 

which expresses the proposition motion does not exist by an endless successive 
communication if now we substitute for r its value in we have 

 — xl — p px or — x p 

whence we have the interpretation if motion has existed from eternity it has 
been eternally caused by an eternal intelligent being together with the converse 
of that proposition 

in prop ix it is argued that “the selfexistent and original cause of all 
things is not a necessary agent but a being endued with liberty and choice” 
the proof is based mainly upon his possession of intelligence and upon the 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


existence of final causes implying design and choice to the objection that the 
supreme cause operates by necessity for the production of what is best it is 
replied that this is a necessity of fitness and wisdom and not of nature 

 in prop x it is argued that “the selfexistent being the supreme 
cause of all things must of necessity have infinite power” the ground of the 
demonstration is that as “all the powers of all things are derived from him 
nothing can make any difficulty or resistance to the execution of his will” it is 
defined that the infinite power of the selfexistent being does not extend to the 
“making of a thing which implies a contradiction” or the doing of that “which 
would imply imperfection whether natural or moral in the being to whom such 
power is ascribed” but that it does extend to the creation of matter and of an 
immaterial cogitative substance endued with a power of beginning motion and 
with a liberty of will or choice upon this doctrine of liberty it is contended that 
we are able to give a satisfactory answer to “that ancient and great question 
tcodev to xaxov what is the cause and original of evil” the argument on this 
head i shall briefly exhibit 

“all that we call evil is either an evil of imperfection as the want of certain 
faculties or excellencies which other creatures have or natural evil as pain 
death and the like or moral evil as all kinds of vice the first of these is 
not properly an evil for every power faculty or perfection which any creature 
enjoys being the free gift of god it is plain the want of any certain faculty 
or perfection in any kind of creatures which never belonged to their natures 
is no more an evil to them than their never having been created or brought 
into being at all could properly have been called an evil the second kind of 
evil which we call natural evil is either a necessary consequence of the former 
as death to a creature on whose nature immortality was never conferred and 
then it is no more properly an evil than the former or else it is counterpoised 
on the whole with as great or greater good as the afflictions and sufferings 
of good men and then also it is not properly an evil or else lastly it is a 
punishment and then it is a necessary consequence of the third and last kind 
of evil viz moral evil and this arises wholly from the abuse of liberty which 
god gave to his creatures for other purposes and which it was reasonable and 
fit to give them for the perfection and order of the whole creation only they 
contrary to god’s intention and command have abused what was necessary to 
the perfection of the whole to the corruption and depravation of themselves 
and thus all sorts of evils have entered into the world without any diminution 
to the infinite goodness of the creator and governor thereof” — p 

the main premises of the above argument may be thus stated 

st all reputed evil is either evil of imperfection or natural evil or moral 
evil 

nd evil of imperfection is not absolute evil 

rd natural evil is either a consequence of evil of imperfection or it is 
compensated with greater good or it is a consequence of moral evil 

th that which is either a consequence of evil of imperfection or is com 
pensated with greater good is not absolute evil 

th all absolute evils are included in reputed evils 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


to express these premises let us assume — 

w reputed evil 
x evil of imperfection 
y natural evil 
z moral evil 

p — consequence of evil of imperfection 
q compensated with greater good 
r consequence of moral evil 
t absolute evil 

then regarding the premises as primary propositions of which all the predi 
cates are particular and the conjunctions either or as absolutely disjunctive 
we have the following equations 

w v al y q yl xl z zl xl yj 

x wl — t 

y v p gl r q pl r r p qj 

pl q ql p vlt 

t vw 

from which if we separately eliminate the symbol v we have 

w “ x yl z l xlz z xl 

xt 

v pl gl — r q pl r rl p qj 

plqqlpt 

t lw 

let it be required first to find what conclusion the premises warrant us 
in forming respecting absolute evils as concerns their dependence upon moral 
evils and the consequences of moral evils 

for this purpose we must determine t in terms of z and r 

the symbols w x y p q must therefore be eliminated the process is easy 
as any set of the equations is reducible to a single equation by addition 
eliminating w from and we have 

t xl l z al z z xl y 

the elimination of p from and gives 

yqr yqt ytl rl q 

the elimination of q from this gives 


yt r 


 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


the elimination of x between and gives 

tyz yl — z 

the elimination of y from and gives 

f — z — r 


this is the only relation existing between the elements t z and r we hence 
get 

 

 r 

 zt h “ z r “ r 


the interpretation of which is absolute evil is either moral evil or it is if not 
moral evil a consequence of moral evil 

any of the results obtained in the process of the above solution furnish us 
with interpretations thus from we might deduce 


 

 ttt o sr o yr o s r 


whence absolute evils are either natural evils which are the consequences of 
moral evils or they are not natural evils at all 

a variety of other conclusions may be deduced from the given equations in 
reply to questions which may be arbitrarily proposed of such i shall give a few 
examples without exhibiting the intermediate processes of solution 

quest — can any relation be deduced from the premises connecting the 
following elements viz absolute evils consequences of evils of imperfection 
evils compensated with greater good 

ans — no relation exists if we eliminate all the symbols but z p q the 
result is 

quest — is any relation implied between absolute evils evils of imperfec 
tion and consequences of evils of imperfection 

ans — the final relation between x t and p is

therefore natural evils which are not moral evils are either absolute evils 
which are the consequences of moral evils or they are not absolute evils at all 

the following conclusions have been deduced in a similar manner the 
subject of each conclusion will show of what particular things a description was 
required and the predicate will show what elements it was designed to involve 


absolute evils which are not consequences of moral evils are moral and not 
natural evils 

absolute evils which are not moral evils are natural evils which are the 
consequences of moral evils 

natural evils which are not consequences of moral evils are not absolute evils 

lastly let us seek a description of evils which are not absolute expressed in 
terms of natural and moral evils 

we obtain as the final equation 

 t yz jjyl z jjl yz y z 

the direct interpretation of this equation is a necessary truth but the reverse 
interpretation is remarkable evils which are both natural and moral and evils 
which are neither natural nor moral are not absolute evils 

this conclusion though it may not express a truth is certainly involved in 
the given premises as formally stated 

 let us take from the same argument a somewhat fuller system of 
premises and let us in those premises suppose that the particles either or 
are not absolutely disjunctive so that in the meaning of the expression “ei 
ther evil of imperfection or natural evil or moral evil” we include whatever 
possesses one or more of these qualities 

let the premises be — 

 all evil w is either evil of imperfection x or natural evil y or moral 
evil z 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


 evil of imperfection x is not absolute evil t 

 natural evil y is either a consequence of evil of imperfection p or it 
is compensated with greater good q or it is a consequence of moral evil r 

 whatever is a consequence of evil of imperfection p is not absolute evil 

 

 whatever is compensated with greater good q is not absolute evil t 

 moral evil z is a consequence of the abuse of liberty 

 that which is a consequence of moral evil r is a consequence of the 
abuse of liberty u 

 absolute evils are included in reputed evils 

the premises expressed in the usual way give after the elimination of the 
indefinite symbols v the following equations 


wl xl yl z 

xt 

¦ylpl qlr 

pt 

qt 

zl u 

r 

t w 


each of these equations satisfies the condition v — v 

the following results are easily deduced — 

natural evil is either absolute evil which is a consequence of moral evil or 
it is not absolute evil at all 

all evils are either absolute evils which are consequences of the abuse of 
liberty or they are not absolute evils 

natural evils are either evils of imperfection which are not absolute evils or 
they are not evils of imperfection at all 

absolute evils are either natural evils which are consequences of the abuse 
of liberty or they are not natural evils and at the same time not evils of im 
perfection 

consequences of the abuse of liberty include all natural evils which are ab 
solute evils and are not evils of imperfection with an indefinite remainder of 
natural evils which are not absolute and of evils which are not natural 

 these examples will suffice for illustration the reader can easily sup 
ply others if they are needed we proceed now to examine the most essential 
portions of the demonstration of spinoza 

definitions 

 by a cause of itself causa sui i understand that of which the essence 
involves existence or that of which the nature cannot be conceived except as 
existing 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


 that thing is said to be finite or bounded in its own kind in suo genere 
finita which may be bounded by another thing of the same kind e g body is 
said to be finite because we can always conceive of another body greater than 
a given one so thought is bounded by other thought but body is not bounded 
by thought nor thought by body 

 by substance i understand that which is in itself in se and is conceived 
by itself per se concipitur ie that whose conception does not require to be 
formed from the conception of another thing 

 by attribute i understand that which the intellect perceives in substance 
as constituting its very essence 

 by mode i understand the affections of substance or that which is in 
another thing by which thing also it is conceived 

 by god i understand the being absolutely infinite that is the substance 
consisting of infinite attributes each of which expresses an eternal and infinite 
essence 

explanation — i say absolutely infinite not infinite in its own kind for to 
whatever is only infinite in its own kind we may deny the possession of some 
infinite attributes but when a thing is absolutely infinite whatsoever expresses 
essence and involves no negation belongs to its essence 

 that thing is termed free which exists by the sole necessity of its own 
nature and is determined to action by itself alone necessary or rather con 
strained which is determined by another thing to existence and action in a 
certain and determinate manner 

 by eternity i understand existence itself in so far as it is conceived 
necessarily to follow from the sole definition of the eternal thing 

explanation — for such existence as an eternal truth is conceived as the 
essence of the thing and therefore cannot be explained by mere duration or 
time though the latter should be conceived as without beginning and without 
end 


axioms 

 all things which exist are either in themselves in se or in another thing 

 that which cannot be conceived by another thing ought to be conceived 
by itself 

 from a given determinate cause the effect necessarily follows and con 
trariwise if no determinate cause be granted it is impossible that an effect 
should follow 

 the knowledge of the effect depends upon and involves the knowledge 
of the cause 

 things which have nothing in common cannot be understood by means 
of each other or the conception of the one does not involve the conception of 
the other 

 a true idea ought to agree with its own object idea vera debet cum suo 
ideato convenire 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


 whatever can be conceived as nonexisting does not involve existence in its 
essence other definitions are implied and other axioms are virtually assumed 
in some of the demonstrations thus in prop i “substance is prior in nature 
to its affections” the proof of which consists in a mere reference to defs 
and there seems to be an assumption of the following axiom viz “that by 
which a thing is conceived is prior in nature to the thing conceived” again 
in the demonstration of prop v the converse of this axiom is assumed to be 
true many other examples of the same kind occur it is impossible therefore 
by the mere processes of logic to deduce the whole of the conclusions of the 
first book of the ethics from the axioms and definitions which are prefixed to 
it and which are given above in the brief analysis which will follow i shall 
endeavour to present in their proper order what appear to me to be the real 
premises whether formally stated or implied and shall show in what manner 
they involve the conclusions to which spinoza was led 

 i conceive then that in the course of his demonstration spinoza effects 
several parallel divisions of the universe of possible existence as 

st into things which are in themselves x and things which are in some 
other thing x whence as these classes of thing together make up the universe 
we have 


x x ax i 
or x — x 

nd into things which are conceived by themselves y and things which are 
conceived through some other thing y whence 

v y ¦ ax ii 

rd into substance z and modes z whence 

z l — z def hi v 

th into things free and things necessary whence 

 • def vii 

th into things which are causes and selfexistent e and things caused by 
some other thing e whence 

e — e def i ax vii 

and his reasoning proceeds upon the expressed or assumed principle that these 
divisions are not only parallel but equivalent thus in def ill substance is 
made equivalent with that which is conceived by itself whence 

z y 

again ax iv as it is actually applied by spinoza establishes the identity of 
cause with that by which a thing is conceived whence 


y e 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


again in def vii things free are identified with things selfexistent whence 

 e 

lastly in def v mode is made identical with that which is in another thing 
whence z x and therefore 

z x 

all these results may be collected together into the following series of equations 
viz 


xyzfel— x — y — f — z — e 

and any two members of this series connected together by the sign of equality 
express a conclusion whether drawn by spinoza or not which is a legitimate 
consequence of his system thus the equation 

z — e 

expresses the sixth proposition of his system viz one substance cannot be 
produced by another similarly the equation 

z e 

expresses his seventh proposition viz “it pertains to the nature of substance 
to exist” this train of deduction it is unnecessary to pursue spinoza applies 
it chiefly to the deduction according to his views of the properties of the divine 
nature having first endeavoured to prove that the only substance is god in the 
steps of this process there appear to me to exist some fallacies dependent chiefly 
upon the ambiguous use of words to which it will be necessary here to direct 
attention in prop v it is endeavoured to show that “there cannot exist 
two or more substances of the same nature or attribute” the proof is virtually 
as follows if there are more substances than one they are distinguished either 
by attributes or modes if by attributes then there is only one substance of 
the same attribute if by modes then laying aside these as nonessential there 
remains no real ground of distinction hence there exists but one substance 
of the same attribute the assumptions here involved are inconsistent with 
those which are found in other parts of the treatise thus substance def iv 
is apprehended by the intellect through the means of attribute by def vi 
it may have many attributes one substance may therefore conceivably be 
distinguished from another by a difference in some of its attributes while others 
remain the same 

in prop viii it is attempted to show that all substance is necessarily 
infinite the proof is as follows there exists but one substance of one attribute 
prop v and it pertains to its nature to exist prop vii it will therefore 
be of its nature to exist either as finite or infinite but not as finite for by 
def ii it would require to be bounded by another substance of the same nature 
which also ought to exist necessarily prop vil therefore there would be two 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


substances of the same attribute which is absurd prop v substance therefore 
is infinite 

in this demonstration the word “finite” is confounded with the expression 
“finite in its own kind” def ii it is thus assumed that nothing can be finite 
unless it is bounded by another thing of the same kind this is not consistent 
with the ordinary meaning of the term spinoza’s use of the term finite tends to 
make space the only form of substance and all existing things but affections of 
space and this i think is really one of the ultimate foundations of his system 

the first scholium applied to the above proposition is remarkable i give 
it in the original words “quum finitum esse revera sit ex parte negatio et 
infinitum absoluta affirmatio existentiae alicujus naturae sequitur ergo ex sola 
prop vil omnem substantiam debere esse infinitam” now this is in reality an 
assertion of the principle affirmed by clarke and controverted by 

butler xiii that necessary existence implies existence in every part of 
space probably this principle will be found to lie at the basis of every attempt 
to demonstrate a priori the existence of an infinite being 

from the general properties of substance above stated and the definition 
of god as the substance consisting of infinite attributes the peculiar doctrines 
of spinoza relating to the divine nature necessarily follow as substance is 
selfexistent free causal in its very nature the thing in which other things 
are and by which they are conceived the same properties are also asserted 
of the deity he is selfexistent prop xi indivisible prop xiii the only 
substance prop xiv the being in which all things are and by which all things 
are conceived prop xv free prop xvii the immanent cause of all things 
prop xviii the proof that god is the only substance is drawn from def vi 
which is interpreted into a declaration that “god is the being absolutely infinite 
of whom no attribute which expresses the essence of substance can be denied” 
every conceivable attribute being thus assigned by definition to him and it 
being determined in prop v that there cannot exist two substances of the 
same attribute it follows that god is the only substance 

though the “ethics” of spinoza like a large portion of his other writings 
is presented in the geometrical form it does not afford a good praxis for the 
symbolical method of this work of course every train of reasoning admits when 
its ultimate premises are truly determined of being treated by that method 
but in the present instance such treatment scarcely differs except in the use of 
letters for words from the processes employed in the original demonstrations 
reasoning which consists so largely of a play upon terms defined as equivalent 
is not often met with and it is rather on account of the interest attaching to 
the subject than of the merits of the demonstrations highly as by some they 
are esteemed that i have devoted a few pages here to their exposition 

 it is not possible i think to rise from the perusal of the arguments of 
clarke and spinoza without a deep conviction of the futility of all endeavours 
to establish entirely a priori the existence of an infinite being his attributes 
and his relation to the universe the fundamental principle of all such specula 
tions viz that whatever we can clearly conceive must exist fails to accomplish 
its end even when its truth is admitted for how shall the finite comprehend 



chapter xiii clarke and spinoza 


 


the infinite yet must the possibility of such conception be granted and in 
something more than the sense of a mere withdrawal of the limits of phaenom 
enal existence before any solid ground can be established for the knowledge 
a priori of things infinite and eternal spinoza’s affirmation of the reality of 
such knowledge is plain and explicit “mens humana adaequatum habet cogni 
tionem aeternae et infinitae essentiae dei” prop xlvii part nd let this be 
compared with prop xxxiv part nd “omnis idea quae in nobis est absoluta 
sive adaequata et perfecta vera est” and with axiom vi part st “idea vera 
debet cum suo ideato convenire” moreover this species of knowledge is made 
the essential constituent of all other knowledge “de natura rationis est res sub 
quadam aeternitatis specie percipere” prop xliv cor ii part nd were 
it said that there is a tendency in the human mind to rise in contemplation 
from the particular towards the universal from the finite towards the infinite 
from the transient towards the eternal and that this tendency suggests to us 
with high probability the existence of more than sense perceives or understand 
ing comprehends the statement might be accepted as true for at least a large 
number of minds there is however a class of speculations the character of 
which must be explained in part by reference to other causes — impatience of 
probable or limited knowledge so often all that we can really attain to a desire 
for absolute certainty where intimations sufficient to mark out before us the 
path of duty but not to satisfy the demands of the speculative intellect have 
alone been granted to us perhaps too dissatisfaction with the present scene 
of things with the undue predominance of these motives the more sober pro 
cedure of analogy and probable induction falls into neglect yet the latter is 
beyond all question the course most adapted to our present condition to infer 
the existence of an intelligent cause from the teeming evidences of surrounding 
design to rise to the conception of a moral governor of the world from the 
study of the constitution and the moral provisions of our own nature these 
though but the feeble steps of an understanding limited in its faculties and its 
materials of knowledge are of more avail than the ambitious attempt to arrive 
at a certainty unattainable on the ground of natural religion and as these were 
the most ancient so are they still the most solid foundations revelation being 
set apart of the belief that the course of this world is not abandoned to chance 
and inexorable fate

equations by the method of reduction to 
a single equivalent equation v 
wherein v satisfies the condition 

v v 


 let us take the remarkable system of premises employed in the previous 
chapter to prove that “matter is not a necessary being” and suppressing the 
th premiss viz motion exists — examine some of the consequences which flow 
from the remaining premises this is in reality to accept as true dr clarke’s 
hypothetical principles but to suppose ourselves ignorant of the fact of the 
existence of motion instances may occur in which such a selection of a portion 
of the premises of an argument may lead to interesting consequences though it 
is with other views that the present example has been resumed the premises 
actually employed will be — 

 if matter is a necessary being either the property of gravitation is neces 
sarily present or it is necessarily absent 

 if gravitation is necessarily absent and the world is not subject to any 
presiding intelligence motion does not exist 

 if gravitation is necessarily present a vacuum is necessary 

 if a vacuum is necessary matter is not a necessary being 

 if matter is a necessary being the world is not subject to a presiding 
intelligence 

if as before we represent the elementary propositions by the following no 
tation viz 

x matter is a necessary being 
y gravitation is necessarily present 
w motion exists 
t gravitation is necessarily absent 

z the world is merely material and not subject to a presiding intelligence 
v a vacuum is necessary 


 



chapter xiv example of analysis 


 


we shall on expression of the premises and elimination of the indefinite class 
symbols q obtain the following system of equations 

xyt xyt 
tzw 
yv 
vx 
xz 

in which for brevity y stands for — y t for — t and so on whence also 
 — t t — y y c 

as the first members of these equations involve only positive terms we can 
form a single equation by adding them together viii prop viz 

xyt xyt yv vx xz tzw 

and it remains to reduce the first member so as to cause it to satisfy the condition 
v v 

for this purpose we will first obtain its development with reference to the 
symbols x and y the result is — 

t v v z tzwxy t v z tzwxy 
u tzwxy tzwxy 

and our object will be accomplished by reducing the four coefficients of the 
development to equivalent forms themselves satisfying the condition required 
now the first coefficient is since v v 

 t z tzw 

which reduces to unity ix prop 

the second coefficient is 


t v z tzw 


and its reduced form x is 

t tv tvz tvzw 

the third coefficient v tzw reduces by the same method to v tzwv and 
the last coefficient tzw needs no reduction hence the development becomes 

xy t tv tvz tvzw xy v tzwv xy tzwxy 

and this is the form of reduction sought 

 now according to the principle asserted in prop iii chap x the whole 
relation connecting any particular set of the symbols in the above equation may 
be deduced by developing that equation with reference to the particular symbols 



chapter xiv example of analysis 


 


in question and retaining in the result only those constituents whose coefficients 
are unity thus if x and y are the symbols chosen we are immediately con 
ducted to the equation 

xy 


whence we have 

 n x 

y 

with the interpretation if gravitation is necessarily present matter is not a 
necessary being 

let us next seek the relation between x and w developing with respect 
to those symbols we get 


y ty tvy tvzy tvzy xw y ty tvy tvzy xw 

 ivy tzvy tzy xw vyxw 

the coefficient of xw and it alone reduces to unity for tvzy tvzy tvy and 
tvy tvy ty and ty ty y and lastly y y this is always the mode 
in which such reductions take place hence we get 


xw 

of which the interpretation is if motion exists matter is not a necessary being 
if in like manner we develop with respect to x and z we get the equation 


xz 



with the interpretation if matter is a necessary being the world is merely ma 
terial and without a presiding intelligence 

this indeed is only the fifth premiss reproduced but it shows that there is 
no other relation connecting the two elements which it involves 

if we seek the whole relation connecting the elements x w and y we find 
on developing with reference to those symbols and proceeding as before 

xy xwy 


suppose it required to determine hence the consequences of the hypothesis 
“motion does not exist” relatively to the questions of the necessity of matter 
and the necessary presence of gravitation we find 


w 



xy 

or — w xy 


xy 

xy 

 

xy xy x 

x with xy 



chapter xiv example of analysis 


 


the direct interpretation of the first equation is if motion does not exist either 
matter is a necessary being and gravitation is not necessarily present or matter 
is not a necessary being 

the reverse interpretation is if matter is a necessary being and gravitation 
not necessary motion does not exist 

in exactly the same mode if we sought the full relation between x z and 
w we should find 

xzw xz 


from this we may deduce 


z xw x 


with xw 


therefore if the world is merely material and not subject to any presiding 
intelligence either matter is a necessary being and motion does not exist or 
matter is not a necessary being 

also reversely if matter is a necessary being and there is no such thing as 
motion the world is merely material 

 we might of course extend the same method to the determination of 
the consequences of any complex hypothesis u such as “the world is merely 
material and without any presiding intelligence z but motion exists” w 
with reference to any other elements of doubt or speculation involved in the 
original premises such as “matter is a necessary being” x “gravitation is a 
necessary quality of matter” y we should for this purpose connect with the 
general equation a new equation 


u wz 


reduce the system thus formed to a single equation v in which v satisfies 
the condition v — v and proceed as above to determine the relation 
between u x and y and finally it as a developed function of x and y but 
it is very much better to adopt the methods of chapters viii and ix i shall 
here simply indicate a few results with the leading steps of their deduction and 
leave their verification to the reader’s choice 

in the problem last mentioned we find as the relation connecting x y w 
and z 

xw xwy xwyz 

and if we write u xy and then eliminate the symbols x and y by the general 
problem chap ix we find 

xu xyu

hence if the world is merely material and without a presiding intelligence and 
at the same time motion exists matter is not a necessary being 

now it has before been shown that if motion exists matter is not a necessary 
being so that the above conclusion tells us even less than we had before ascer 
tained to be inferentially true nevertheless that conclusion is the proper and 
complete answer to the question which was proposed which was to determine 
simply the consequences of a certain complex hypothesis it would thus be 
easy even from the limited system of premises before us to deduce a great 
variety of additional inferences involving in the conditions which are given 
any proposed combinations of the elementary propositions if the condition is 
one which is inconsistent with the premises the fact will be indicated by the 
form of the solution the value which the method will assign to the combina 
tion of symbols expressive of the proposed condition will be if on the other 
hand the fulfilment of the condition in question imposes no restriction upon the 
propositions among which relation is sought so that every combination of those 
propositions is equally possible — the fact will also be indicated by the form of 
the solution examples of each of these cases are subjoined 

if in the ordinary way we seek the consequences which would flow from the 
condition that matter is a necessary being and at the same time that motion 
exists as affecting the propositions the world is merely material and without 
a presiding intelligence and gravitation is necessarily present we shall obtain 
the equation 

xw 

which indicates that the condition proposed is inconsistent with the premises 
and therefore cannot be fulfilled 

if we seek the consequences which would flow from the condition that matter 
is not a necessary being and at the same time that motion does exist with refer 
ence to the same elements as above viz the absence of a presiding intelligence 
and the necessity of gravitation we obtain the following result 

 

 xw yz yl z yz — l z 

which might literally be interpreted as follows 

if matter is not a necessary being and motion exists then either the world 
is merely material and without a presiding intelligence and gravitation is nec 
essary or one of these two results follows without the other or they both fail of 
being true wherefore of the four possible combinations of which some one is 
true of necessity and of which of necessity one only can be true it is affirmed 
that any one may be true such a result is a truism — a mere necessary truth 
still it contains the only answer which can be given to the question proposed 

i do not deem it necessary to vindicate against the charge of laborious trifling 
these applications it may be requisite to enter with some fulness into details 
useless in themselves in order to establish confidence in general principles and 
methods when this end shall have been accomplished in the subject of the 
present inquiry let all that has contributed to its attainment but has afterwards 
been found superfluous be forgotten 



chapter xv 

the aristotelian logic and its modern 
extensions examined by the method of 
this treatise 


 the logical system of aristotle modified in its details but unchanged in its 
essential features occupies so important a place in academical education that 
some account of its nature and some brief discussion of the leading problems 
which it presents seem to be called for in the present work it is i trust in no 
narrow or harshly critical spirit that i approach this task my object indeed 
is not to institute any direct comparison between the timehonoured system of 
the schools and that of the present treatise but setting truth above all other 
considerations to endeavour to exhibit the real nature of the ancient doctrine 
and to remove one or two prevailing misapprehensions respecting its extent and 
sufficiency 

that which may be regarded as essential in the spirit and procedure of the 
aristotelian and of all cognate systems of logic is the attempted classification 
of the allowable forms of inference and the distinct reference of those forms col 
lectively or individually to some general principle of an axiomatic nature such 
as the “dictum of aristotle” whatsoever is affirmed or denied of the genus may 
in the same sense be affirmed or denied of any species included under that genus 
concerning such general principles it may i think be observed that they either 
state directly but in an abstract form the argument which they are supposed to 
elucidate and so stating that argument affirm its validity or involve in their 
expression technical terms which after definition conduct us again to the same 
point viz the abstract statement of the supposed allowable forms of inference 
the idea of classification is thus a pervading element in those systems further 
more they exhibit logic as resolvable into two great branches the one of which 
is occupied with the treatment of categorical the other with that of hypotheti 
cal or conditional propositions the distinction is nearly identical with that of 
primary and secondary propositions in the present work the discussion of the 
theory of categorical propositions is in all the ordinary treatises of logic much 
more full and elaborate than that of hypothetical propositions and is occupied 
partly with ancient scholastic distinctions partly with the canons of deductive 
inference to the latter application only is it necessary to direct attention here 


 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


 categorical propositions are classed under the four following heads viz 


st universal affirmative propositions 
nd universal negative 
rd particular affirmative 

th particular negative 


type 

all y’s are x’s 

no y’s are x’s 

some u’s are x’s 
some p’s are not x’s 


to these forms four others have recently been added so as to constitute in 
the whole eight forms see the next article susceptible however of reduction 
to six and subject to relations which have been discussed with great fulness 
and ability by professor de morgan in his formal logic a scheme somewhat 
different from the above has been given to the world by sir w hamilton and 
is made the basis of a method of syllogistic inference which is spoken of with 
very high respect by authorities on the subject of logic 

the processes of formal logic in relation to the above system of proposi 
tions are described as of two kinds viz “conversion” and “syllogism” by 
conversion is meant the expression of any proposition of the above kind in an 
equivalent form but with a reversed order of terms by syllogism is meant the 
deduction from two such propositions having a common term whether subject 
or predicate of some third proposition inferentially involved in the two and 
forming the “conclusion” it is maintained by most writers on logic that these 
processes and according to some the single process of syllogism furnish the 
universal types of reasoning and that it is the business of the mind in any train 
of demonstration to conform itself whether consciously or unconsciously to the 
particular models of the processes which have been classified in the writings of 
logicians 

 the course which i design to pursue is to show how these processes of 
syllogism and conversion may be conducted in the most general manner upon 
the principles of the present treatise and viewing them thus in relation to a 
system of logic the foundations of which it is conceived have been laid in the 
ultimate laws of thought to seek to determine their true place and essential 
character 

the expressions of the eight fundamental types of proposition in the language 
of symbols are as follows 


 all y’s are x’s 

 no y’s are x’s 

 some y’s are x’s 

 some y’s are notx’s 

 all noty’s are x’s 

 no noty’s are x’s 

 some noty’s are x’s 

 some noty’s are not 


y vx 

v v x 
vy vx 
vy vl — x 

 — y vx 

 — y vl — x 
vl — y vx 

’sil — y ul — x 


in referring to these forms it will be convenient to apply in a sense shortly to 
be explained the epithets of logical quantity “universal” and “particular” and 

 thomson’s outlines of the laws of thought p 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


of quality “affirmative” and “negative” to the terms of propositions and not 
to the propositions themselves we shall thus consider the term “all y’s” as 
universalaffirmative the term “y’s” or “some h’s” as particularaffirmative 
the term “all not y’s” as universalnegative the term “some noty’s” as 
particularnegative the expression “no y’s’ is not properly a term of a propo 
sition for the true meaning of the proposition “no y’s are x’s” is “all y’s 
are notx’s” the subject of that proposition is therefore universalaffirmative 
the predicate particularnegative that there is a real distinction between the 
conceptions of “men” and “not men” is manifest this distinction is all that i 
contemplate when applying as above the designations of affirmative and nega 
tive without however insisting upon the etymological propriety of the applica 
tion to the terms of propositions the designations positive anil privative would 
have been more appropriate but the former term is already employed in a fixed 
sense in other parts of this work 

 from the symbolical forms above given the laws of conversion immediately 
follow thus from the equation 


y vx 

representing the proposition “all y’s are x’s” we deduce on eliminating v 

y x 

which gives by solution with reference to — x 

 

 x oiy 

the interpretation of which is 

all notx’s are noty’s 

this is an example of what is called “negative conversion” in like manner 
the equation 

v v x 

representing the proposition “no y’s are x’s” gives 

x 

the interpretation of which is “no x’s are y’s” this is an example of what 
is termed simple conversion though it is in reality of the same kind as the 
conversion exhibited in the previous example all the examples of conversion 
which have been noticed by logicians are either of the above kind or of that 
which consists in the mere transposition of the terms of a proposition without 
altering their quality as when we change 


vy vx representing some y’s are x’s 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


into 

vx — vy representing some a’s are y’ s 

or they involve a combination of those processes with some auxiliary process of 
limitation as when from the equation 

y vx representing all y’s are a’s 
we deduce on multiplication by v 

vy — vx representing some v’s are a’s 

and hence 

vx vy representing some a’s are y’s 

in this example the process of limitation precedes that of transposition 

from these instances it is seen that conversion is a particular application of 
a much more general process in logic of which many examples have been given 
in this work that process has for its object the determination of any element 
in any proposition however complex as a logical function of the remaining ele 
ments instead of confining our attention to the subject and predicate regarded 
as simple terms we can take any element or any combination of elements enter 
ing into either of them make that element or that combination the “subject” 
of a new proposition and determine what its predicate shall be in accordance 
with the data afforded to us it may be remarked that even the simple forms of 
propositions enumerated above afford some ground for the application of such a 
method beyond what the received laws of conversion appear to recognise thus 
the equation 

y vx representing all y’s are a’s 
gives us in addition to the proposition before deduced the three following 

st y — x there are no y’s that are nota’s 

nd — y jjx — x things that are noty’s include all 

things that are nota’s and an 
indefinite remainder of things 
that are a’s 

rd x y jjl — y things that are a’s include all things 

that are y’s and an indefinite 
remainder of things that are not 

y’s 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


these conclusions it is true merely place the given proposition in other and 
equivalent forms but such and no more is the office of the received mode of 
“negative conversion” 

furthermore these processes of conversion are not elementary but they are 
combinations of processes more simple than they more immediately dependent 
upon the ultimate laws and axioms which govern the use of the symbolical in 
strument of reasoning this remark is equally applicable to the case of syllogism 
which we proceed next to consider 

 the nature of syllogism is best seen in the particular instance suppose 
that we have the propositions 


all x’s are y’s 

all f’s are z’s 

from these we may deduce the conclusion 

all a’s are z’s 

this is a syllogistic inference the terms x and z are called the extremes and 
y is called the middle term the function of the syllogism generally may now 
be defined given two propositions of the kind whose species are tabulated in 
 and involving one middle or common term y which is connected in one of 
the propositions with an extreme x in the other with an extreme z required 
the relation connecting the extremes x and z the term y may appear in its 
affirmative form as all y’s some y’s or in its negative form as all noty’s 
some noty’s in either proposition without regard to the particular form which 
it assumes in the other 

nothing is easier than in particular instances to resolve the syllogism by the 
method of this treatise its resolution is indeed a particular application of the 
process for the reduction of systems of propositions taking the examples above 
given we have 


x vy 
y vz 

whence by substitution 

x vvz 

which is interpreted into 

all a’s are z’s 

or proceeding rigorously in accordance with the method developed in viii 
we deduce 

xl y yl z 

adding these equations and eliminating y we have 


x — z 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


whence x z or all x’s are z’s 

and in the same way may any other case be treated 

 quitting however the consideration of special examples let us examine 
the general forms to which all syllogism may be reduced 

proposition i 

to deduce the general rules of syllogism 

by the general rules of syllogism i here mean the rules applicable to premises 
admitting of every variety both of quantity and of quality in their subjects and 
predicates except the combination of two universal terms in the same proposi 
tion the admissible forms of propositions are therefore those of which a tabular 
view is given in 

let x and y be the elements or things entering into the first premiss z and 
y those involved in the second two cases fundamentally different in character 
will then present themselves the terms involving y will either be of like or 
of unlike quality those terms being regarded as of like quality when they both 
speak of “y’s” or both of “noty’s” as of unlike quality when one of them 
speaks of “y’s” and the other of “noty’s” any pair of premises in which the 
former condition is satisfied may be represented by the equations 

vx vy 

wz wy 

for we can employ the symbol y to represent either “all y’s” or “all noty’s” 
since the interpretation of the symbol is purely conventional if we employ y 
in the sense of “all noty’s” then — y will represent “all y’s” and no other 
change will be introduced an equal freedom is permitted with respect to the 
symbols x and z so that the equations and may by properly assigning 
the interpretations of x y and z be made to represent all varieties in the 
combination of premises dependent upon the quality of the respective terms 
again by assuming proper interpretations to the symbols v v w w in those 
equations all varieties with reference to quantity may also be represented thus 
if we take v and represent by v a class indefinite the equation will 
represent a universal proposition according to the ordinary sense of that term 
i e a proposition with universal subject and particular predicate we may in 
fact give to subject and predicate in either premiss whatever quantities using 
this term in the scholastic sense we please except that by hypothesis they 
must not both be universal the system represents therefore with 
perfect generality the possible combinations of premises which have like middle 
terms 

 that our analysis may be as general as the equations to which it is 
applied let us by the method of this work eliminate y from and and 
seek the expressions for x — x and vx in terms of and of the symbols v 
v w w the above will include all the possible forms of the subject of the 
conclusion the form il — x is excluded inasmuch as we cannot from the 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


interpretation vx some x’s given in the premises interpret ul — x as some 
notx’s the symbol v when used in the sense of “some” applies to that term 
only with which it is connected in the premises 

the results of the analysis are as follows 

x yvww utl — w l — w ww l — v l — v l — v l — w 

 w ci i 

 — x vl — vww l — w l — w v — ww 

 i — w i — w ww l — v l — v l — l l — ll 

 ul — ww jjuil — w — zj l — z ii 

vx vvww — l — w l — wz l — vj — hi 

each of these expressions involves in its second member two terms of one 
of which is a factor of the other — z but syllogistic inference does not as a 
matter of form admit of contrary classes in its conclusion as of z’s and notz’s 
together 

we must therefore in order to determine the rules of that species of in 
ference ascertain under what conditions the second members of any of our 
equations are reducible to a single term 

the simplest form is hi and it is reducible to a single term if w 
the equation then becomes 

vx vvwz 

the first member is identical with the extreme in the first premiss the second is 
of the same quantity and quality as the extreme in the second premiss for since 
w the second member of involving the middle term y is universal 
therefore by the hypothesis the first member is particular and therefore the 
second member of involving the same symbol w in its coefficient is particular 
also hence we deduce the following law 

condition of inference one middle term at least universal 

rule of inference — equate the extremes 

from an analysis of the equations i and ii it will further appear that 
the above is the only condition of syllogistic inference when the middle terms 
are of like quality thus the second member of i reduces to a single term if 
w and v and the second member of ii reduces to a single term if 
w’ v w in each of these cases it is necessary that w the 
solely sufficient condition before assigned 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


consider secondly the case in which the middle terms are of unlike quality 
the premises may then be represented under the forms 

vx vy 

wz w l — y 

and if as before we eliminate y and determine the expressions of x — x and 
vx we get 

x vvl — ww jjttil — v — ul — tl — w 

 tl — iul — w 

 vvw — ul — v vl — to — z iv 

i — x wwv ul — tl — w wrul — v 

 — ul — il — w vl — tul — w z 
 vl v vl w vl u z v 

vx ufl — ww uu l — rul — wz 

 vvw uul — u l — z vi 

now the second member of vi reduces to a single term relatively to z if 
w giving 

vx vvw vvl — ul — z 

the second member of which is opposite both in quantity and quality to the 
corresponding extreme wz in the second premiss for since w wz is 
universal but the factor vv indicates that the term to which it is attached 
is particular since by hypothesis v and v are not both equal to hence we 
deduce the following law of inference in the case of like middle terms 

first condition of inference — f least one universal extreme 

rule of inference — change the quantity and quality of that extreme 
and equate the result to the other extreme 

moreover the second member of v reduces to a single term if v 
w it then gives 

 — x vw — uwz 

now since v w the middle terms of the premises are both universal 
therefore the extremes vx wz are particular but in the conclusion the extreme 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


involving x is opposite both in quantity and quality to the extreme vx in the 
first premiss while the extreme involving agrees both in quantity and quality 
with the corresponding extreme wz in the second premiss hence the following 
general law 

second condition of inference — two universal middle terms 

rule of inference — change the quantity and quality of either extreme 
and equate the result to the other extreme unchanged 

there are in the case of unlike middle terms no other conditions or rules of 
syllogistic inference than the above thus the equation iv though reducible 
to the form of a syllogistic conclusion when w and v does not thereby 
establish a new condition of inference since by what has preceded the single 
condition v or w would suffice 

 the following examples will sufficiently illustrate the general rules of 
syllogism above given 


 all y’s are x’s 

all z’s are v’s 

this belongs to case all y’s is the universal middle term the extremes 
equated give as the conclusion 


all z’s are x’s 

the universal term all z’s becoming the subject the particular term some 
x’s the predicate 


 all x’s are y’s 

no z’s are v’s 

the proper expression of these premises is 

all x’s are y’s 

all z’s are notv’s 

they belong to case and satisfy the first condition of inference the middle 
term y’s in the first premiss is particularaffirmative that in the second pre 
miss notv’s particularnegative if we take all z’s as the universal extreme 
and change its quantity and quality according to the rule we obtain the term 
some notz’s and this equated with the other extreme all x’s gives 

all x’s are notxs i e no x’s are z’s 

if we commence with the other universal extreme and proceed similarly we 
obtain the equivalent result 


no z’s are x’s 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


 all y s are x’s 

all notx’s are z’s 

here also the middle terms are unlike in quality the premises therefore belong 
to case and there being two universal middle terms the second condition of 
inference is satisfied if by the rule we change the quantity and quality of the 
first extreme some x’s we obtain all notx’s which equated with the other 
extreme gives 

all notx’s are z’s 

the reverse order of procedure would give the equivalent result 

all notxs are x’s 

the conclusions of the two last examples would not be recognised as valid 
in the scholastic system of logic which virtually requires that the subject of 
a proposition should be affirmative they are however perfectly legitimate 
in themselves and the rules by which they are determined form undoubtedly 
the most general canons of syllogistic inference the process of investigation 
by which they are deduced will probably appear to be of needless complexity 
and it is certain that they might have been obtained with greater facility and 
without the aid of any symbolical instrument whatever it was however my 
object to conduct the investigation in the most general manner and by an 
analysis thoroughly exhaustive with this end in view the brevity or prolixity 
of the method employed is a matter of indifference indeed the analysis is 
not properly that of the syllogism but of a much more general combination of 
propositions for we are permitted to assign to the symbols v v w w any 
classinterpretations that we please to illustrate this remark i will apply the 
solution i to the following imaginary case 

suppose that a number of pieces of cloth striped with different colours were 
submitted to inspection and that the two following observations were made 
upon them 

st that every piece striped with white and green was also striped with 
black and yellow and vice versa 

nd that every piece striped with red and orange was also striped with 
blue and yellow and vice versa suppose it then required to determine how 
the pieces marked with green stood affected with reference to the colours white 
black red orange and blue 

here if we assume v white x green v ’ black y yellow w red 
 orange w’ blue the expression of our premises will be 

vx v’y 
wz wy 

agreeing with the system the equation i then leads to the following 
conclusion 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


pieces striped with green are either striped with orange white black red 
and blue together all pieces possessing which character are included in those 
striped with green or they are striped with orange white and black but not 
with red or blue or they are striped with orange red and blue but not with 
white or black or they are striped with orange but not with white or red or 
they are striped with white and black but not with blue or orange or they are 
striped neither with white nor orange 

considering the nature of this conclusion neither the symbolical expression 
i by which it is conveyed nor the analysis by which that expression is deduced 
can be considered as needlessly complex 

 the form in which the doctrine of syllogism has been presented in this 
chapter affords ground for an important observation we have seen that in 
each of its two great divisions the entire discussion is reducible so far at least 
as concerns the determination of rules and methods to the analysis of a pair 
of equations viz of the system when the premises have like middle 
terms and of the system when the middle terms are unlike moreover 
that analysis has been actually conducted by a method founded upon certain 
general laws deduced immediately from the constitution of language chap ii 
confirmed by the study of the operations of the human mind chap iii and 
proved to be applicable to the analysis of all systems of equations whatever 
by which propositions or combinations of propositions can be represented 
chap viii here then we have the means of definitely resolving the question 
whether syllogism is indeed the fundamental type of reasoning — whether the 
study of its laws is coextensive with the study of deductive logic for if it be so 
some indication of the fact must be given in the systems of equations upon the 
analysis of which we have been engaged it cannot be conceived that syllogism 
should be the one essential process of reasoning and yet the manifestation of 
that process present nothing indicative of this high quality of preeminence no 
sign however appears that the discussion of all systems of equations expressing 
propositions is involved in that of the particular system examined in this chapter 
and yet writers on logic have been all but unanimous in their assertion not 
merely of the supremacy but of the universal sufficiency of syllogistic inference 
in deductive reasoning the language of archbishop whately always clear 
and definite and on the subject of logic entitled to peculiar attention is very 
express on this point “for logic” he says “which is as it were the grammar 
of reasoning does not bring forward the regular syllogism as a distinct mode of 
argumentation designed to be substituted for any other mode but as the form 
to which all correct reasoning may be ultimately reduced” and mr mill in a 
chapter of his system of logic entitled “of ratiocination or syllogism” having 
enumerated the ordinary forms of syllogism observes “all valid ratiocination 
all reasoning by which from general propositions previously admitted other 
propositions equally or less general are inferred may be exhibited in some of 
the above forms” and again “we are therefore at liberty in conformity with 
the general opinion of logicians to consider the two elementary forms of the first 

 elements of logic p ninth edition 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


figure as the universal types of all correct ratiocination” in accordance with 
these views it has been contended that the science of logic enjoys an immunity 
from those conditions of imperfection and of progress to which all other sciences 
are subject and its origin from the travail of one mighty mind of old has by a 
somewhat daring metaphor been compared to the mythological birth of pallas 

as syllogism is a species of elimination the question before us manifestly 
resolves itself into the two following ones — st whether all elimination is re 
ducible to syllogism ndly whether deductive reasoning can with propriety be 
regarded as consisting only of elimination i believe upon careful examination 
the true answer to the former question to be that it is always theoretically pos 
sible so to resolve and combine propositions that elimination may subsequently 
be effected by the syllogistic canons but that the process of reduction would 
in many instances be constrained and unnatural and would involve operations 
which are not syllogistic to the second question i reply that reasoning cannot 
except by an arbitrary restriction of its meaning be confined to the process of 
elimination no definition can suffice which makes it less than the aggregate 
of the methods which are founded upon the laws of thought as exercised upon 
propositions and among those methods the process of elimination eminently 
important as it is occupies only a place 

much of the error as i cannot but regard it which prevails respecting the 
nature of the syllogism and the extent of its office seems to be founded in 
a disposition to regard all those truths in logic as primary which possess the 
character of simplicity and intuitive certainty without inquiring into the relation 
which they sustain to other truths in the science or to general methods in 
the art of reasoning aristotle’s dictum de omni et nullo is a selfevident 
principle but it is not found among those ultimate laws of the reasoning faculty 
to which all other laws however plain and selfevident admit of being traced 
and from which they may in strictest order of scientific evolution be deduced 
for though of every science the fundamental truths are usually the most simple 
of apprehension yet is not that simplicity the criterion by which their title to 
be regarded as fundamental must be judged this must be sought for in the 
nature and extent of the structure which they are capable of supporting taking 
this view leibnitz appears to me to have judged correctly when he assigned to 
the “principle of contradiction” a fundamental place in logic for we have seen 
the consequences of that law of thought of which it is the axiomatic expression 
iii but enough has been said upon the nature of deductive inference and 
upon its constitutive elements the subject of induction may probably receive 
some attention in another part of this work 

 it has been remarked in this chapter that the ordinary treatment of hy 
pothetical is much more defective than that of categorical propositions what 
is commonly termed the hypothetical syllogism appears indeed to be no syllo 
gism at all 

let the argument — 

 introduction to kant’s “logik” 

 nouveaux essais sur l’entendement humain liv iv cap theodicee pt i sec 



chapter xv aristotelian logic 


 


if a is b c is d 

but a is b 

therefore c is d 
be put in the form — 

if the proposition x is true y is true 

but x is true 

therefore y is true 

wherein by x is meant the proposition a is b and by y the proposition c 
is d it is then seen that the premises contain only two terms or elements 
while a syllogism essentially involves three the following would be a genuine 
hypothetical syllogism 

if x is true y is true 

if y is true z is true 

if x is true z is true 

after the discussion of secondary propositions in a former part of this work 
it is evident that the forms of hypothetical syllogism must present in every re 
spect an exact counterpart to those of categorical syllogism particular propo 
sitions such as “sometimes if x is true y is true” may be introduced and the 
conditions and rules of inference deduced in this chapter for categorical syllo 
gisms may without abatement be interpreted to meet the corresponding cases 
in hypotheticals 

 to what final conclusions are we then led respecting the nature and 
extent of the scholastic logic i think to the following that it is not a science 
but a collection of scientific truths too incomplete to form a system of them 
selves and not sufficiently fundamental to serve as the foundation upon which 
a perfect system may rest it does not however follow that because the logic 
of the schools has been invested with attributes to which it has no just claim 
it is therefore undeserving of regard a system which has been associated with 
the very growth of language which has left its stamp upon the greatest ques 
tions and the most famous demonstrations of philosophy cannot be altogether 
unworthy of attention memory too and usage it must be admitted have 
much to do with the intellectual processes and there are certain of the canons 
of the ancient logic which have become almost inwoven in the very texture of 
thought in cultured minds but whether the mnemonic forms in which the 
particular rules of conversion and syllogism have been exhibited possess any 
real utility — whether the very skill which they are supposed to impart might 
not with greater advantage to the mental powers be acquired by the unassisted 
efforts of a mind left to its own resources — are questions which it might still be 
not unprofitable to examine as concerns the particular results deduced in this 
chapter it is to be observed that they are solely designed to aid the inquiry 
concerning the nature of the ordinary or scholastic logic and its relation to a 
more perfect theory of deductive reasoning 



chapter xvi 


on the theory of probabilities 


 before the expiration of another year just two centuries will have rolled 
away since pascal solved the first known question in the theory of probabilities 
and laid in its solution the foundations of a science possessing no common 
share of the attraction which belongs to the more abstract of mathematical 
speculations the problem which the chevalier de mere a reputed gamester 
proposed to the recluse of port royal not yet withdrawn from the interests of 
scienceby the more distracting contemplation of the “greatness and the misery 
of man” was the first of a long series of problems destined to call into existence 
new methods in mathematical analysis and to render valuable service in the 
practical concerns of life nor does the interest of the subject centre merely 
in its mathematical connexion or its associations of utility the attention is 
repaid which is devoted to the theory of probabilities as an independent object 
of speculation — to the fundamental modes in which it has been conceived — 
to the great secondary principles which as in the contemporaneous science of 
mechanics have gradually been annexed to it — and lastly to the estimate of 
the measure of perfection which has been actually attained i speak here of that 
perfection which consists in unity of conception and harmony of processes some 
of these points it is designed very briefly to consider in the present chapter 

 a distinguished writer has thus stated the fundamental definitions of the 
science 

“the probability of an event is the reason we have to believe that it has 
taken place or that it will take place” 

“the measure of the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of cases 
favourable to that event to the total number of cases favourable or contrary 
and all equally possible” equally likely to happen 

from these definitions it follows that the word probability in its mathemati 
cal acceptation has reference to the state of our knowledge of the circumstances 
under which an event may happen or fail with the degree of information which 

 see in particular a letter addressed by pascal to fermat who had solicited his attention 
to a mathematical problem port royal par m de sainte beuve also various passages in 
the collection of fragments published by m prosper faugere

chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


we possess concerning the circumstances of an event the reason we have to think 
that it will occur or to use a single term our expectation of it will vary prob 
ability is expectation founded upon partial knowledge a perfect acquaintance 
with all the circumstances affecting the occurrence of an event would change 
expectation into certainty and leave neither room nor demand for a theory of 
probabilities 

 though our expectation of an event grows stronger with the increase of 
the ratio of the number of the known cases favourable to its occurrence to the 
whole number of equally possible cases favourable or unfavourable it would be 
unphilosophical to affirm that the strength of that expectation viewed as an 
emotion of the mind is capable of being referred to any numerical standard 
the man of sanguine temperament builds high hopes where the timid despair 
and the irresolute are lost in doubt as subjects of scientific inquiry there is 
some analogy between opinion and sensation the thermometer and the care 
fully prepared photographic plate indicate not the intensity of the sensations 
of heat and light but certain physical circumstances which accompany the pro 
duction of those sensations so also the theory of probabilities contemplates the 
numerical measure of the circumstances upon which expectation is founded and 
this object embraces the whole range of its legitimate applications the rules 
which we employ in lifeassurance and in the other statistical applications of the 
theory of probabilities are altogether independent of the mental phaenomena of 
expectation they are founded upon the assumption that the future will bear 
a resemblance to the past that under the same circumstances the same event 
will tend to recur with a definite numerical frequency not upon any attempt to 
submit to calculation the strength of human hopes and fears 

now experience actually testifies that events of a given species do under 
given circumstances tend to recur with definite frequency whether their true 
causes be known to us or unknown of course this tendency is in general only 
manifested when the area of observation is sufficiently large the judicial records 
of a great nation its registries of births and deaths in relation to age and sex 
c present a remarkable uniformity from year to year in a given language 
or family of languages the same sounds and successions of sounds and if it 
be a written language the same characters and successions of characters recur 
with determinate frequency the key to the rude ogham inscriptions found 
in various parts of ireland and in which no distinction of words could at first 
be traced was by a strict application of this principle recovered the same 
method it is understood has been applied to the deciphering of the cuneiform 
records recently disentombed from the ruins of nineveh by the enterprise of mr 
layard 

 let us endeavour from the above statements and definitions to form a 
conception of the legitimate object of the theory of probabilities 

the discovery is due to the rev charles graves professor of mathematics in the uni 
versity of dublin vide proceedings of the royal irish academy feb professor 
graves informs me that he has verified the principle by constructing sequence tables for all 
the european languages 

 by the learned orientalist dr edward hincks 



chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


probability it has been said consists in the expectation founded upon a 
particular kind of knowledge viz the knowledge of the relative frequency of 
occurrence of events hence the probabilities of events or of combinations 
of events whether deduced from a knowledge of the particular constitution of 
things under which they happen or derived from the longcontinued observation 
of a past series of their occurrences and failures constitute in all cases our data 
the probability of some connected event or combination of events constitutes 
the corresponding qucesitum or object sought now in the most general yet 
strict meaning of the term “event” every combination of events constitutes also 
an event the simultaneous occurrence of two or more events or the occurrence 
of an event under given conditions or in any conceivable connexion with other 
events is still an event using the term in this liberty of application the object 
of the theory of probabilities might be thus defined given the probabilities 
of any events of whatever kind to find the probability of some other event 
connected with them 

 events may be distinguished as simple or compound the latter term 
being applied to such events as consist in a combination of simple events i 
in this manner we might define it as the practical end of the theory under 
consideration to determine the probability of some event simple or compound 
from the given probabilities of other events simple or compound with which 
by the terms of its definition it stands connected 

thus if it is known from the constitution of a die that there is a probability 

measured by the fraction that the result of any particular throw will be an 

 


ace and if it is required to determine the probability that there shall occur one 
ace and only one in two successive throws we may state the problem in the 
order of its data and its qucesitum as follows 

first datum — probability of the event that the first throw will give an 


ace 


 

 


second datum — probability of the event that the second throw will give 


an ace 


 

 


qujesitum — probability of the event that either the first throw will give an 
ace and the second not an ace or the first will not give an ace and the second 
will give one 

here the two data are the probabilities of simple events defined as the first 
throw giving an ace and the second throw giving an ace the quaesitum is 
the probability of a compound event — a certain disjunctive combination of the 
simple events involved or implied in the data probably it will generally happen 
when the numerical conditions of a problem are capable of being deduced as 
above from the constitution of things under which they exist that the data 
will be the probabilities of simple events and the qucesitum the probability of 
a compound event dependent upon the said simple events such is the case 
with a class of problems which has occupied perhaps an undue share of the 
attention of those who have studied the theory of probabilities viz games of 
chance and skill in the former of which some physical circumstance as the 



chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


constitution of a die determines the probability of each possible step of the 
game its issue being some definite combination of those steps while in the 
latter the relative dexterity of the players supposed to be known a priori 
equally determines the same element but where as in statistical problems the 
elements of our knowledge are drawn not from the study of the constitution 
of things but from the registered observations of nature or of human society 
there is no reason why the data which such observations afford should be the 
probabilities of simple events on the contrary the occurrence of events or 
conditions in marked combinations indicative of some secret connexion of a 
causal character suggests to us the propriety of making such concurrences 
profitable for future instruction by a numerical record of their frequency now 
the data which observations of this kind afford are the probabilities of compound 
events the solution by some general method of problems in which such data 
are involved is thus not only essential to the perfect development of the theory 
of probabilities but also a perhaps necessary condition of its application to a 
large and practically important class of inquiries 

 before we proceed to estimate to what extent known methods may be 
applied to the solution of problems such as the above it will be advantageous 
to notice that there is another form under which all questions in the theory of 
probabilities may be viewed and this form consists in substituting for events 
the propositions which assert that those events have occurred or will occur and 
viewing the element of numerical probability as having reference to the truth of 
those propositions not to the occurrence of the events concerning which they 
make assertion thus instead of considering the numerical fraction p as ex 
pressing the probability of the occurrence of an event e let it be viewed as 
representing the probability of the truth of the proposition x which asserts 
that the event e will occur similarly instead of any probability q being con 
sidered as referring to some compound event such as the concurrence of the 
events e and f let it represent the probability of the truth of the proposition 
which asserts that e and f will jointly occur and in like manner let the trans 
formation be made from disjunctive and hypothetical combinations of events to 
disjunctive and conditional propositions though the new application thus as 
signed to probability is a necessary concomitant of the old one its adoption will 
be attended with a practical advantage drawn from the circumstance that we 
have already discussed the theory of propositions have defined their principal 
varieties and established methods for determining in every case the amount 
and character of their mutual dependence upon this or upon some equivalent 
basis any general theory of probabilities must rest i do not say that other 
considerations may not in certain cases of applied theory be requisite the data 
may prove insufficient for definite solution and this defect it may be thought 
necessary to supply by hypothesis or where the statement of large numbers 
is involved difficulties may arise after the solution from this source for which 
special methods of treatment are required but in every instance some form of 
the general problem as above stated art is involved and in the discussion of 
that problem the proper and peculiar work of the theory consists i desire it to 
be observed that to this object the investigations of the following chapters are 



chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


mainly devoted it is not intended to enter except incidentally upon questions 
involving supplementary hypotheses because it is of primary importance even 
with reference to such questions i that a general method founded upon 
a solid and sufficient basis of theory be first established 

 the following is a summary chiefly taken from laplace of the principles 
which have been applied to the solution of questions of probability they are 
consequences of its fundamental definitions already stated and may be regarded 
as indicating the degree in which it has been found possible to render those 
definitions available 

principle st if p be the probability of the occurrence of any event — p 
will be the probability of its nonoccurrence 

nd the probability of the concurrence of two independent events is the 
product of the probabilities of those events 

rd the probability of the concurrence of two dependent events is equal 
to the product of the probability of one of them by the probability that if that 
event occur the other will happen also 

th the probability that if an event e take place an event f will also 
take place is equal to the probability of the concurrence of the events e and 
f divided by the probability of the occurrence of e 

th the probability of the occurrence of one or the other of two events 
which cannot concur is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities 

th if an observed event can only result from some one of n different causes 
which are a priori equally probable the probability of any one of the causes is 
a fraction whose numerator is the probability of the event on the hypothesis of 
the existence of that cause and whose denominator is the sum of the similar 
probabilities relative to all the causes 

th the probability of a future event is the sum of the products formed by 
multiplying the probability of each cause by the probability that if that cause 
exist the said future event will take place 

 respecting the extent and the relative sufficiency of these principles the 
following observations may be made 

st it is always possible by the due combination of these principles to 
express the probability of a compound event dependent in any manner upon 
independent simple events whose distinct probabilities are given a very large 
proportion of the problems which have been actually solved are of this kind 
and the difficulty attending their solution has not arisen from the insufficiency 
of the indications furnished by the theory of probabilities but from the need of 
an analysis which should render those indications available when functions of 
large numbers or series consisting of many and complicated terms are thereby 
introduced it may therefore be fully conceded that all problems having for 
their data the probabilities of independent simple events fall within the scope 
of received methods 

ndly certain of the principles above enumerated and especially the sixth 
and seventh do not presuppose that all the data are the probabilities of simple 
events in their peculiar application to questions of causation they do how 
ever assume that the causes of which they take account are mutually exclusive 



chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


so that no combination of them in the production of an effect is possible if 
as before explained we transfer the numerical probabilities from the events 
with which they are connected to the propositions by which those events are 
expressed the most general problem to which the aforesaid principles are ap 
plicable may be stated in the following order of data and qucesita 

data 

st the probabilities of the n conditional propositions 

if the cause a exist the event e will follow 

” a ” e 


” a n ” e 

nd the condition that the antecedents of those propositions are mutually 
conflicting 


requirements 

the probability of the truth of the proposition which declares the occurrence 
of the event e also when that proposition is known to be true the probabilities 
of truth of the several propositions which affirm the respective occurrences of 
the causes a a a n 

here it is seen that the data are the probabilities of a series of compound 
events expressed by conditional propositions but the system is obviously a very 
limited and particular one for the antecedents of the propositions are subject 
to the condition of being mutually exclusive and there is but one consequent 
the event e in the whole system it does not follow from our ability to discuss 
such a system as the above that we are able to resolve problems whose data are 
the probabilities of any system of conditional propositions far less that we can 
resolve problems whose data are the probabilities of any system of propositions 
whatever and viewing the subject in its material rather than its formal aspect 
it is evident that the hypothesis of exclusive causation is one which is not often 
realized in the actual world the phsenomena of which seem to be usually the 
products of complex causes the amount and character of whose cooperation is 
unknown such is without doubt the case in nearly all departments of natural 
or social inquiry in which the doctrine of probabilities holds out any new promise 
of useful applications 

 to the above principles we may add another which has been stated in 
the following terms by the savilian professor of astronomy in the university of 
oxford 

“principle if there be any number of mutually exclusive hypotheses 
hi h • • • of which the probabilities relative to a particular state of infor 
mation are pip p and if new information be given which changes the 
probabilities of some of them suppose of h rn and all that follow without

r s szc philosophical magazine may 



chapter xvi on the theory of probabilities 


 


having otherwise any reference to the rest then the probabilities of these latter 
have the same ratios to one another after the new information that they had 
before that is 

pi vi ¦ p ¦ ¦ ¦ pm pi p ¦ p ¦ ¦ ¦ ¦ pm 

where the accented letters denote the values after the new information has been 
acquired” 

this principle is apparently of a more fundamental character than the most 
of those before enumerated and perhaps it might as has been suggested by 
professor donkin be regarded as axiomatic it seems indeed to be founded in 
the very definition of the measure of probability as “the ratio of the number of 
cases favourable to an event to the total number of cases favourable or contrary 
and all equally possible” for adopting this definition it is evident that in 
whatever proportion the number of equally possible cases is diminished while 
the number of favourable cases remains unaltered in exactly the same propor 
tion will the probabilities of any events to which these cases have reference be 
increased and as the new hypothesis viz the diminution of the number of 
possible cases without affecting the number of them which are favourable to the 
events in question increases the probabilities of those events in a constant ratio 
the relative measures of those probabilities remain unaltered if the principle 
we are considering be then as it appears to be inseparably involved in the very 
definition of probability it can scarcely of itself conduct us further than the 
attentive study of the definition would alone do in the solution of problems 
from these considerations it appears to be doubtful whether without some aid 
of a different kind from any that has yet offered itself to our notice any consid 
erable advance either in the theory of probabilities as a branch of speculative 
knowledge or in the practical solution of its problems can be hoped for and 
the establishment solely upon the basis of any such collection of principles as 
the above of a method universally applicable to the solution of problems with 
out regard either to the number or to the nature of the propositions involved in 
the expression of their data seems to be impossible for the attainment of such 
an object other elements are needed the consideration of which will occupy the 
next chapter 



chapter xvii 


demonstration of a general method for 
the solution of problems in the theory 
of probabilities 


 it has been defined xvi that “the measure of the probability of an event 
is the ratio of the number of cases favourable to that event to the total number 
of cases favourable or unfavourable and all equally possible” in the following 
investigations the term probability will be used in the above sense of “measure 
of probability” 

from the above definition we may deduce the following conclusions 

i when it is certain that an event will occur the probability of that event 
in the above mathematical sense is for the cases which are favourable to the 
event and the cases which are possible are in this instance the same 

hence also if p be the probability that an event x will happen — p will 
be the probability that the said event will not happen to deduce this result 
directly from the definition let in be the number of cases favourable to the 
event x n the number of cases possible then n m is the number of cases 
unfavourable to the event x hence by definition 

tfi 

— probability that x will happen 

n 

n — m 

 probability that x will not happen 

n 


but 

n — m m 

 — p 

n n 

ii the probability of the concurrence of any two events is the product of the 
probability of either of those events by the probability that if that event occur 
the other will occur also 

let to be the number of cases favourable to the happening of the first event 
and n the number of equally possible cases unfavourable to it then the prob 

ttl 

ability of the first event is by definition of the to cases favourable 

to n 


 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


to the first event let l cases be favourable to the conjunction of the first and 

second events then by definition — is the probability that if the first event 

to 

happen the second also will happen multiplying these fractions together we 
have 

m l l 
m n to to n 

but the resulting fraction m l n has for its numerator the number of cases 
favourable to the conjunction of events and for its denominator the number 
to n of possible cases therefore it represents the probability of the joint 
occurrence of the two events 

hence if p be the probability of any event x and q the probability that if x 
occur y will occur the probability of the conjunction xy will be pq 

iii the probability that if an event x occur the event y will occur is 
a fraction whose numerator is the probability of their joint occurrence and 
denominator the probability of the occurrence of the event x 

this is an immediate consequence of principle nd 

iv the probability of the occurrence of some one of a series of exclusive 
events is equal to the sum of their separate probabilities 

for let n be the number of possible cases mi the number of those cases 

favourable to the first event m the number of cases favourable to the second 

c then the separate probabilities of the events are — — c again as the 

n n 

events are exclusive none of the cases favourable to one of them is favourable to 
another and therefore the number of cases favourable to some one of the series 
will be mi m and the probability of some one of the series happening 

will be — but this is the sum of the previous fractions — — 

n n n 

c whence the principle is manifest definition — two events are said 

to be independent when the probability of the happening of either of them is 
unaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or failure of the other 

from this definition combined with principle ii we have the following 
conclusion 

v the probability of the concurrence of two independent events is equal to 
the product of the separate probabilities of those events 

for if p be the probability of an event x q that of an event y regarded as 
quite independent of x then is q also the probability that if x occur y will occur 
hence by principle ii pq is the probability of the concurrence of x and y 
under the same circumstances the probability that x will occur and y not 
occur will be p — q for p is the probability that x will occur and — q 
the probability that y will not occur in like manner — p — q will be the 
probability that both the events fail of occurring 

 there exists yet another principle different in kind from the above but 
necessary to the subsequent investigations of this chapter before proceeding 
to the explicit statement of which i desire to make one or two preliminary 
observations 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


i would in the first place remark that the distinction between simple and 
compound events is not one founded in the nature of events themselves but 
upon the mode or connexion in which they are presented to the mind how 
many separate particulars for instance are implied in the terms “to be in 
health” “to prosper” c each of which might still be regarded as expressing 
a “simple event” the prescriptive usages of language which have assigned to 
particular combinations of events single and definite appellations and have left 
unnumbered other combinations to be expressed by corresponding combinations 
of distinct terms or phrases is essentially arbitrary when then we designate 
as simple events those which are expressed by a single verb or by what gram 
marians term a simple sentence we do not thereby imply any real simplicity 
in the events themselves but use the term solely with reference to grammati 
cal expression now if this distinction of events as simple or compound is 
not founded in their real nature but rests upon the accidents of language it 
cannot affect the question of their mutual dependence or independence if my 
knowledge of two simple events is confined to this particular fact viz that the 
probability of the occurrence of one of them is p and that of the other q then 
i regard the events as independent and thereupon affirm that the probability 
of their joint occurrence is pq but the ground of this affirmation is not that 
the events are simple ones but that the data afford no information whatever 
concerning any connexion or dependence between them when the probabilities 
of events are given but all information respecting their dependence withheld 
the mind regards them as independent and this mode of thought is equally 
correct whether the events judged according to actual expression are simple 
or compound ie whether each of them is expressed by a single verb or by a 
combination of verbs 

 let it however be supposed that together with the probabilities of 
certain events we possess some definite information respecting their possible 
combinations for example let it be known that certain combinations are ex 
cluded from happening and therefore that the remaining combinations alone 
are possible then still is the same general principle applicable the mode in 
which we avail ourselves of this information in the calculation of the probability 
of any conceivable issue of events depends not upon the nature of the events 
whose probabilities and whose limits of possible connexion are given it matters 
not whether they are simple or compound it is indifferent from what source or 
by what methods the knowledge of their probabilities and of their connecting 
relations has been derived we must regard the events as independent of any 
connexion beside that of which we have information deeming it of no conse 
quence whether such information has been explicitly conveyed to us in the data 
or thence deduced by logical inference and this leads us to the statement of the 
general principle in question viz 

vi the events whose probabilities are given are to be regarded as indepen 
dent of any connexion but such as is either expressed or necessarily implied 
in the data and the mode in which our knowledge of that connexion is to be 
employed is independent of the nature of the source from which such knowledge 
has been derived 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


the practical importance of the above principle consists in the circumstance 
that whatever may be the nature of the events whose probabilities are given — 
whatever the nature of the event whose probability is sought we are always 
able by an application of the calculus of logic to determine the expression of 
the latter event as a definite combination of the former events and definitely 
to assign the whole of the implied relations connecting the former events with 
each other in other words we can determine what that combination of the 
given events is whose probability is required and what combinations of them 
are alone possible it follows then from the above principle that we can reason 
upon those events as if they were simple events whose conditions of possible 
combination had been directly given by experience and of which the probability 
of some definite combination is sought the possibility of a general method in 
probabilities depends upon this reduction 

 as the investigations upon which we are about to enter are based upon 
the employment of the calculus of logic it is necessary to explain certain terms 
and modes of expression which are derived from this application 

by the event x i mean that event of which the proposition which affirms 
the occurrence is symbolically expressed by the equation 

x 

by the event fx y z i mean that event of which the occurrence is ex 
pressed by the equation 

xyz 

such an event may be termed a compound event in relation to the simple 
events x y z which its conception involves thus if x represent the event “it 
rains” y the event “it thunders” the separate occurrences of those events being 
expressed by the logical equations 

x l y 

then will xl — y y — x represent the event or state of things denoted by 
the proposition “it either rains or thunders but not both” the expression of 
that state of things being 


y x 

if for brevity we represent the function phix y z used in the above ac 
ceptation by v it is evident vi that the law of duality 

v v 


will be identically satisfied 

the simple events x y z will be said to be “conditioned” when they are 
not free to occur in every possible combination in other words when some 
compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring thus the 
events denoted by the propositions “it rains” “it thunders” are “conditioned” 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


if the event denoted by the proposition “it thunders but does not rain” is 
excluded from happening so that the range of possible is less than the range 
of conceivable combination simple unconditioned events are by definition in 
dependent 

any compound event is similarly said to be conditioned if it is assumed that 
it can only occur under a certain condition that is in combination with some 
other event constituting by its presence that condition 

 we shall proceed in the natural order of thought from simple and uncon 
ditioned to compound and conditioned events 


proposition i 


st if p q r are the respective probabilities of any unconditioned simple 
events x y z the probability of any compound event v will be v this function 
v being formed by changing in the function v the symbols x y z into p q 
r c 

ndly under the same circumstances the probability that if the event v 
occur any other event v will also occur will be v x wherein vv denotes 
the result obtained by multiplying together the logical functions v and v and 
changing in the residt x y z c into p q r c 

let us confine our attention in the first place to the possible combinations of 
the two simple events x and y of which the respective probabilities are p and 
q the primary combinations of those events vll and their corresponding 
probabilities are as follows 


events 

xy 

xi y 
 xy 


concurrence of x and y 
occurrence of x without y 
occurrence of y without x 
conjoint failure of x and y 


probabilities 

pq 

p ¦ 

 pq 

 pl q 


we see that in these cases the probability of the compound event represented 
by a constituent is the same function of p and q as the logical expression of that 
event is of x and y and it is obvious that this remark applies whatever may 
be the number of the simple events whose probabilities are given and whose 
joint existence or failure is involved in the compound event of which we seek 
the probability 

consider in the second place any disjunctive combination of the above 
constituents the compound event expressed in ordinary language as the oc 
currence of “either the event x without the event y or the event y without the 
event x” is symbolically expressed in the form t — y yi — x and its prob 
ability determined by principles iv and v is p — q gl — p the latter 
of these expressions is the same function of p and q as the former is of x and 
y and it is obvious that this is also a particular illustration of a general rule 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


the events which are expressed by any two or more constituents are mutually 
exclusive the only possible combination of them is a disjunctive one expressed 
in ordinary language by the conjunction or in the language of symbolical logic 
by the sign now the probability of the occurrence of some one out of a set 
of mutually exclusive events is the sum of their separate probabilities and is 
expressed by connecting the expressions for those separate probabilities by the 
sign thus the law above exemplified is seen to be general the probabil 
ity of any unconditioned event v will be found by changing in v the symbols 
xyz into pqr 

 again by principle iii the probability that if the event v occur the 
event v will occur with it is expressed by a fraction whose numerator is the 
probability of the joint occurrence of v and v and denominator the probability 
of the occurrence of v 

now the expression of that event or state of things which is constituted 
by the joint occurrence of the events v and v will be formed by multiplying 
together the expressions v and v according to the rules of the calculus of 
logic since whatever constituents are found in both v and v will appear in 
the product and no others again by what has just been shown the proba 
bility of the event represented by that product will be determined by changing 
therein x y z into pqr hence the numerator sought will be what vv by 
definition represents and the denominator will be v wherefore 


probability that if v occur v will occur with it 


w 

m 


 for example if the probabilities of the simple events xyz are pqr 
respectively and it is required to find the probability that if either x or y occur 
then either y or z will occur we have for the logical expressions of the antecedent 
and consequent — 


st either x or y occurs xl — y y — x 

nd either y or z occurs y — z z — y 

if now we multiply these two expressions together according to the rules of 
the calculus of logic we shall have for the expression of the concurrence of 
antecedent and consequent 

xz y y xl 

changing in this result x y z into p q r and similarly transforming the expres 
sion of the antecedent we find for the probability sought the value 

prl q qlpl r 

po q qo p 

the special function of the calculus in a case like the above is to supply the 
office of the reason in determining what are the conjunctures involved at once 
in the consequent and the antecedent but the advantage of this application is 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


almost entirely prospective and will be made manifest in a subsequent propo 
sition 


proposition ii 


 it is known that the probabilities of certain simple events xy z are 
pqr respectively when a certain condition v is satisfied v being in expres 
sion a function of xy z required the absolute probabilities of the events 
x y z that is the probabilities of their respective occurrence independently 
of the condition v 

let p q r c be the probabilities required i e the probabilities of the 
events x y z regarded not only as simple but as independent events then 
by prop i the probabilities that these events will occur when the condition v 
represented by the logical equation v is satisfied are 

m yv zv 

m ’ v ’ v ’ •’ 

in which xv denotes the result obtained by multiplying v by x according to 
the rules of the calculus of logic and changing in the result x y z into p 
 r c but the above conditioned probabilities are by hypothesis equal to 
pqr respectively hence we have 


xv 


 p 





 r c 


from which system of equations equal in number to the quantities p q r 
the values of those quantities may be determined 

now xv consists simply of those constituents in v of which a is a factor 
let this sum be represented by v x and in like manner let yv be represented by 
vy c our equations then assume the form 


va n m 

p p 


q c 


where v x denotes the results obtained by changing in v x the symbols x y z 
 c into p q r c 

to render the meaning of the general problem and the principle of its solution 
more evident let us take the following example suppose that in the drawing of 
balls from an urn attention had only been paid to those cases in which the balls 
drawn were either of a particular colour “white” or of a particular composition 
“marble” or were marked by both these characters no record having been kept 
of those cases in which a ball that was neither white nor of marble had been 
drawn let it then have been found that whenever the supposed condition was 
satisfied there was a probability p that a white ball would be drawn arid a 
probability q that a marble ball would be drawn and from these data alone let 
it be required to find the probability that in the next drawing without reference 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


at all to the condition above mentioned a white ball will be drawn also the 
probability that a marble ball will be drawn 

here if x represent the drawing of a white ball y that of a marble ball the 
condition v will be represented by the logical function 

xy x y xy 

hence we have 

v x xy xl yx v y xy xy y 

whence 

v x p v y q 

and the final equations of the problem are 

p 

pq pl q gl p p ’ pfq pl q qi p 

from which we find 

 p p 

p • 

 p 

it is seen that p and q are respectively proportional to p and g as by 
professor donkin’s principle they ought to be the solution of this class of 
problems might indeed by a direct application of that principle be obtained 

to meet a possible objection i here remark that the above reasoning does 
not require that the drawings of a white and a marble ball should be indepen 
dent in virtue of the physical constitution of the balls the assumption of their 
independence is indeed involved in the solution but it does not rest upon any 
prior assumption as to the nature of the balls and their relations or freedom 
from relations of form colour structure c it is founded upon our total ig 
norance of all these things probability always has reference to the state of our 
actual knowledge and its numerical value varies with varying information 

proposition iii 

 to determine in any question of probabilities the logical connexion of 
the quaesitum with the data that is to assign the event whose probability is 
sought as a logical function of the event whose probabilities are given 

let s t c represent any compound events whose probabilities are given 
s and t being in expression known functions of the symbols x y z c rep 
resenting simple events similarly let w represent any event whose probability 
is sought w being also a known function of x y z c as s t w must 
satisfy the fundamental law of duality we are permitted to replace them by 
single logical symbols stw assume then 


s st tw w 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


these by the definition of st w will be a series of logical equations 
connecting the symbols stw with the symbols xyz 

by the methods of the calculus of logic we can eliminate from the above 
system any of the symbols xy z representing events whose probabilities 
are not given and determine w as a developed function of s t c and of such 
of the symbols x y z c if any such there be as correspond to events whose 
probabilities are given the result will be of the form 

w a ob — c — zl 

where a b c and d comprise among them all the possible constituents which 
can be formed from the symbols s t c i e from all the symbols representing 
events whose probabilities are given 

the above will evidently be the complete expression of the relation sought 
for it fully determines the event w represented by the single symbol w as a 
function or combination of the events similarly denoted by the symbols s t c 
and it assigns by the laws of the calculus of logic the condition 

d — 

as connecting the events s t c among themselves we may therefore by 
principle vi regard s t c as simple events of which the combination w 
and the condition with which it is associated d are definitely determined 

uniformity in the logical processes of reduction being desirable i shall here 
state the order which will generally be pursued 

 by vm the primitive equations are reducible to the forms 

sl s s 

tlt tlt 


wl — w — w — w 

under which they can be added together without impairing their significance 
we can then eliminate the symbols x y z either separately or together if the 
latter course is chosen it is necessary after adding together the equations of the 
system to develop the result with reference to all the symbols to be eliminated 
and equate to the product of all the coefficients of the constituents vii 

as w is the symbol whose expression is sought we may also by prop iii 
chap ix express the result of elimination in the form 

ew e — w 

e and e being successively determined by making in the general system 
w and w and eliminating the symbols x y z thus the single 
equations from which e and e are to be respectively determined become 

sl s — s tl t t — t — w 
sl s s t t t t w 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


from these it only remains to eliminate x y z c and to determine w by 
subsequent development in the process of elimination we may if needful avail 
ourselves of the simplifications of props i and ii chap ix 

 should the data beside informing us of the probabilities of events 
further assign among them any explicit connexion such connexion must be 
logically expressed and the equation or equations thus formed be introduced 
into the general system 


proposition iv 


 given the probabilities of any system of events to determine by a general 
method the consequent or derived probability of any other event 

as in the last proposition let s t c be the events whose probabilities 
are given w the event whose probability is sought these being known functions 
of x y z c let us represent the data as follows 

probability of s p 

probability of t q 

and so on p q c being known numerical values if then we represent the 
compound event s by s t by t and w by to we find by the last proposition 

w a ob —c d 

a b c and d being functions of s t c moreover the data are trans 
formed into 

prob s p prob t q c 

now the equation is resolvable into the system 


w a qc 
d 


 


q being an indefinite class symbol vi but since by the properties of 
constituents v prop iii we have 


a b c d 


the second equation of the above system may be expressed in the form 

a b c 


if we represent the function a b c by v the system becomes 


w a qc 
vl 


 

 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


let us for a moment consider this result since v is the sum of a series 
of constituents of s t c it represents the compound event in which the 
simple events involved are those denoted by s t c hence shows that 
the events denoted by s t c and whose probabilities are p q c have 
such probabilities not as independent events but as events subject to a certain 
condition v equation expresses w as a similarly conditioned combination 
of the same events 

now by principle vi the mode in which this knowledge of the connexion of 
events has been obtained does not influence the mode in which when obtained 
it is to be employed we must reason upon it as if experience had presented to 
us the events s t c as simple events free to enter into every combination 
but possessing when actually subject to the condition v the probabilities p q 
c respectively 

let then p q be the corresponding probabilities of such events when 
the restriction v is removed then by prop ii of the present chapter these 
quantities will be determined by the system of equations 

 p 



and by prop i the probability of the event w under the same condition v will 
be 


prob 


 a cc 

v 


 


wherein v s denotes the sum of those constituents in v of which s is a factor 
and vs what that sum becomes when st are changed into p q re 
spectively the constant c represents the probability of the indefinite event q 
it is therefore arbitrary and admits of any value from to 

now it will be observed that the values ofp q c are determined from 
 only in order that they may be substituted in so as to render prob w 
a function of known quantities p q c it is obvious therefore that instead 
of the letters p q c we might employ any others as s t c in the same 
quantitative acceptations this particular step would simply involve a change 
of meaning of the symbols s t c — their ceasing to be logical and becoming 
quantitative the systems and would then become 


vs 

v 


 p 


v 

v 


q c 


prob 


w 


a cc 
v 


 

 


in employing these it is only necessary to determine from s t c regarded 
as quantitative symbols in terms of p g c and substitute the resulting values 
in it is evident that s t c inasmuch as they represent probabilities 
will be positive proper fractions 

the system may be more symmetrically expressed in the form 


vs 

p 


vt 

q 


 v 


ii 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


or we may express both and together in the symmetrical system 


v a v t a cc 

p q u 


 


wherein u represents prob w 

 it remains to interpret the constant c assumed to represent the proba 
bility of the indefinite event q now the logical equation 


w a qc 


interpreted in the reverse order implies that if either the event a take place 
or the event c in connexion with the event q the event w will take place and 
not otherwise hence q represents that condition under which if the event c 
take place the event w will take place but the probability of q is c hence 
therefore c probability that if the event c take place the event w will take 
place 

wherefore by principle ii 

probability of concurrence of c and w 
probability of c 

we may hence determine the nature of that new experience from which the 
actual value of c may be obtained for if we substitute in c for s t c their 
original expressions as functions of the simple events x y z c we shall form 
the expression of that event whose probability constitutes the denominator of 
the above value of c and if we multiply that expression by the original expression 
of w we shall form the expression of that event whose probability constitutes 
the numerator of c and the ratio of the frequency of this event to that of the 
former one determined by new observations will give the value of c let it be 
remarked here that the constant c does not necessarily make its appearance in 
the solution of a problem it is only when the data are insufficient to render 
determinate the probability sought that this arbitrary element presents itself 
and in this case it is seen that the final logical equation or informs us 
how it is to be determined 

if that new experience by which c may be determined cannot be obtained 
we can still by assigning to c its limiting values and determine the limits 
of the probability of w these are 

minor limit of prob w y 
superior limit a y c ¦ 

between these limits it is certain that the probability sought must lie indepen 
dently of all new experience which does not absolutely contradict the past 

if the expression of the event c consists of many constituents the logical 
value of w being of the form 

w a jjci c 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


we can instead of employing their aggregate as above present the final solution 
in the form 

 a ci ci c c c 

prob w — 

here ci probability that if the event ci occur the event w will occur and 
so on for the others convenience must decide which form is to be preferred 

 the above is the complete theoretical solution of the problem proposed 
it may be added that it is applicable equally to the case in which any of the 
events mentioned in its original statement are conditioned thus if one of the 
data is the probability p that if the event x occur the event y will occur the 
probability of the occurrence of x not being given we must assume prob x — c 
an arbitrary constant then prob xy cp and these two conditions must 
be introduced into the data and employed according to the previous method 
again if it is sought to determine the probability that if an event x occur an 
event y will occur the solution will assume the form 


prob sought 


prob xy 
prob x ’ 


the numerator and denominator of which must be separately determined by the 
previous general method 

 we are enabled by the results of these investigations to establish a 
general rule for the solution of questions in probabilities

case i when all the events are unconditioned 

form the symbolical expressions of the events whose probabilities are given 
or sought 

equate such of those expressions as relate to compound events to a new 
series of symbols s t c which symbols regard as representing the events no 
longer as compound but simple to whose expressions they have been equated 

eliminate from the equations thus formed all the logical symbols except 
those which express events s t c whose respective probabilities p c 
are given or the event w whose probability is sought and determine w as a 
developed function of s t c in the form 

w a b c d 

let a b c v and let v s represent the aggregate of those constituents in 
v which contain s as a factor v t of those which contain t as a factor and thus 
for all the symbols whose probabilities are given

or form the symmetrical system of equations 

v a v t a cc v

where u represents the probability sought 

if c appear in the solution its interpretation will be

and this interpretation indicates the nature of the experience which is necessary 
for its discovery 

case ii — when some of the events are conditioned 

if there be given the probability p that if the event x occur the event y 
will occur and if the probability of the antecedent x be not given resolve the 
proposition into the two following viz 

probability of x c 

probability of xy cp 

if the quaesitum be the probability that if the event w occur the event z will 
occur determine separately by the previous case the terms of the fraction 

prob wz 

prob w 

and the fraction itself will express the probability sought 

it is understood in this case that x y w z may be any compound events 
whatsoever the expressions xy and wz represent the products of the sym 
bolical expressions of x and y and of w and z formed according to the rules 
of the calculus of logic 

the determination of the single constant c may in certain cases be resolved 
into or replaced by the determination of a series of arbitrary constants ci c 
according to convenience as previously explained 

 it has been stated i that there exist two distinct definitions or 
modes of conception upon which the theory of probabilities may be made to 
depend one of them being connected more immediately with number the other 
more directly with logic we have now considered the consequences which flow 
from the numerical definition and have shown how it conducts us to a point 
in which the necessity of a connexion with logic obviously suggests itself we 
have seen to some extent what is the nature of that connexion and further 
in what manner the peculiar processes of logic and the more familiar ones 
of quantitative algebra are involved in the same general method of solution 
each of these so accomplishing its own object that the two processes may be 
regarded as supplementary to each other it remains to institute the reverse 
order of investigation and setting out from a definition of probability in which 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


the logical relation is more immediately involved to show how the numerical 
definition would thence arise and how the same general method equally depen 
dent upon both elements would finally but by a different order of procedure 
be established 

that between the symbolical expressions of the logical calculus and those of 
algebra there exists a close analogy is a fact to which attention has frequently 
been directed in the course of the present treatise it might even be said that 
they possess a community of forms and to a very considerable degree a com 
munity of laws with a single exception in the latter respect their difference is 
only one of interpretation thus the same expression admits of a logical or of 
a quantitative interpretation according to the particular meaning which we at 
tach to the symbols it involves the expression xy represents under the former 
condition a concurrence of the events denoted by x and y under the latter 
the product of the numbers or quantities denoted by x and y and thus every 
expression denoting an event simple or compound admits under another sys 
tem of interpretation of a meaning purely quantitative here then arises the 
question whether there exists any principle of transition in accordance with 
which the logical and the numerical interpretations of the same symbolical ex 
pression shall have an intelligible connexion and to this question the following 
considerations afford an answer 

 let it be granted that there exists such a feeling as expectation a feeling 
of which the object is the occurrence of events and which admits of differing 
degrees of intensity let it also be granted that this feeling of expectation ac 
companies our knowledge of the circumstances under which events are produced 
and that it varies with the degree and kind of that knowledge then without 
assuming or tacitly implying that the intensity of the feeling of expectation 
viewed as a mental emotion admits of precise numerical measurement it is per 
fectly legitimate to inquire into the possibility of a mode of numerical estimation 
which shall at least satisfy these following conditions viz that the numerical 
value which it assigns shall increase when the known circumstances of an event 
are felt to justify a stronger expectation shall diminish when they demand a 
weaker expectation and shall remain constant when they obviously require an 
equal degree of expectation 

now these conditions at least will be satisfied if we assume the fundamental 
principle of expectation to be this viz that the laws for the expression of 
expectation viewed as a numerical element shall be the same as the laws for the 
expression of the expected event viewed as a logical element thus if jx y z 
represent any unconditional event compounded in any manner of the events x 
y z let the same expression jx y z according to the above principle denote 
the expectation of that event x y z representing no longer the simple events 
involved but the expectations of those events 

for in the first place it is evident that under this hypothesis the probability 
of the occurrence of some one of a set of mutually exclusive events will be equal 
to the sum of the separate probabilities of those events thus if the alternation 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


in question consist of n mutually exclusive events whose expressions are 

tix y z a o yz n x y z 

the expression of that alternation will be 

pix v z j x yz j n x y z 

the literal symbols x y z being logical and relating to the simple events of which 
the three alternatives are compounded and by hypothesis the expression of 
the probability that some one of those alternatives will occur is 

 ix y z f x yz j n x y z 

x y z here denoting the probabilities of the above simple events now this 
expression increases eceteris paribus with the increase of the number of the 
alternatives which are involved and diminishes with the diminution of their 
number which is agreeable to the condition stated 

furthermore if we set out from the above hypothetical definition of the 
measure of probability we shall be conducted either by necessary inference or 
by successive steps of suggestion which might perhaps be termed necessary to 
the received numerical definition we are at once led to recognise unity as 
the proper numerical measure of certainty for it is certain that any event x or 
its contrary — x will occur the expression of this proposition is 

x — x 

whence by hypothesis x — x the measure of the probability of the above 
proposition becomes the measure of certainty but the value of that expression 
is whatever the particular value of x may be unity or is therefore on the 
hypothesis in question the measure of certainty 

let there in the next place be n mutually exclusive but equally possible 
events which we will represent by t t t n the proposition which affirms 
that some one of these must occur will be expressed by the equation 

t t ¦ ¦ ¦ t n — 

and as when we pass in accordance with the reasoning of the last section to 
numerical probabilities the same equation remains true in form and as the 
probabilities ti t ¦ ¦ ¦ t n are equal we have 


nt 

whence u h and similarly t t n u suppose it then required to 
determine the probability that some one event of the partial series tt t rn 
will occur we have for the expression required 

 

ti t t m — i tom terms 

n m 
m 


n 



chapter xvii general method in probabilities 


 


hence therefore if there are m cases favourable to the occurrence of a particular 
alternation of events out of n possible and equally probable cases the probability 
of the occurrence of that alternation will be expressed by the fraction — 

now the occurrence of any event which may happen in different equally 
possible ways is really equivalent to the occurrence of an alternation ie of some 
one out of a set of alternatives hence the probability of the occurrence of any 
event may be expressed by a fraction whose numerator represents the number of 
cases favourable to its occurrence and denominator the total number of equally 
possible cases but this is the rigorous numerical definition of the measure of 
probability that definition is therefore involved in the more peculiarly logical 
definition the consequences of which we have endeavoured to trace 

 from the above investigations it clearly appears st that whether we 
set out from the ordinary numerical definition of the measure of probability 
or from the definition which assigns to the numerical measure of probability 
such a law of value as shall establish a formal identity between the logical 
expressions of events and the algebraic expressions of their values we shall be 
led to the same system of practical results ndly that either of these definitions 
pursued to its consequences and considered in connexion with the relations 
which it inseparably involves conducts us by inference or suggestion to the 
other definition to a scientific view of the theory of probabilities it is essential 
that both principles should be viewed together in their mutual bearing and 
dependence 



chapter xviii 

elementary illustrations of the general 
method in probabilities 


 it is designed here to illustrate by elementary examples the general method 
demonstrated in the last chapter the examples chosen will be chiefly such as 
from their simplicity permit a ready verification of the solutions obtained but 
some intimations will appear of a higher class of problems hereafter to be more 
fully considered the analysis of which would be incomplete without the aid of a 
distinct method determining the necessary conditions among their data in order 
that they may represent a possible experience and assigning the corresponding 
limits of the final solutions the fuller consideration of that method and of its 
applications is reserved for the next chapter 

 ex — the probability that it thunders upon a given day is p the 
probability that it both thunders and hails is q but of the connexion of the 
two phaenomena of thunder and hail nothing further is supposed to be known 
required the probability that it hails on the proposed day 

let x represent the event — it thunders 

let y represent the event — it hails 

then xy will represent the event — it thunders and hails and the data of the 
problem are 

prob x p prob xy q 

there being here but one compound event xy involved assume according to 
the rule 

xy u 

our data then become 

proba p prob it g 

and it is required to find proby now gives 

y — ux h — u — x — ux h — — ul — x 
x 


 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


hence xvii we find 

v ux — ux — ul — x 
v x ux — ux x v u ux 


and the equations of the general rule viz 


vc 

p 


vu 

q 


 v 


prob y 


a cc 
v 


become on substitution and observing that a ux c — itl — x and 
that v reduces to x — ul — x 


x ux 
p q 

prob y 


x — ul — a 

ux c — ul — x 
x — ul — x 


 

 


from which we readily deduce by elimination of x and u 

prob y q cl — p 

in this result c represents the unknown probability that if the event — ul — x 
happen the event y will happen now l — ul — x — xyl — x — x 
on actual multiplication hence c is the unknown probability that if it do not 
thunder it will hail 

the general solution may therefore be interpreted as follows — the prob 
ability that it hails is equal to the probability that it thunders and hails q 
together with the probability that it does not thunder — p multiplied by the 
probability c that if it does not thunder it will hail and common reasoning 
verifies this result 

if c cannot be numerically determined we find on assigning to it the limiting 
values and the following limits of prob y viz 

inferior limit q 

superior limit q — p 

 ex —the probability that one or both of two events happen is p that 
one or both of them fail is q what is the probability that only one of these 
happens 

let x and y represent the respective events then the data are — 


prob xy xl — y — xy p 

prob xl — y — xy — al — y q 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


and we are to find 

prob xl — y yl — x 

here all the events concerned being compound assume 


xy xl y xy s 
xl v xy xl — y t 
xl — y — xy w 


then eliminating x and y and determining w as a developed function of s and 
t we find 

w st osl — t — st — sl — t 

hence a st c v st sl — t — st s — st v s sv t t 
and the equations of the general rule xvii become 

 s st 

p q 


prob 


st 

s “h — st ’ 


whence we find on eliminating s and t 


prob w p q — 


hence p q — is the measure of the probability sought this result may be 
verified as follows — since p is the probability that one or both of the given 
events occur — p will be the probability that they both fail and since q is 
the probability that one or both fail — is the probability that they both 
happen hence — p — q or — p — q is the probability that they either 
both happen or both fail but the only remaining alternative which is possible 
is that one alone of the events happens hence the probability of this occurrence 
is — — p — q or p q — as above ex — the probability that a 
witness a speaks the truth is p the probability that another witness b speaks 
the truth is q and the probability that they disagree in a statement is r what 
is the probability that if they agree their statement is true 

let x represent the hypothesis that a speaks truth y that b speaks truth 
then the hypothesis that a and b disagree in their statement will be represented 
by xl — y y — x the hypothesis that they agree in statement by xy 
 — xl — y and the hypothesis that they agree in the truth by xy hence 
we have the following data 

prob x p prob y g prob xl — y y — x r 
from which we are to determine 


prob xy 

prob xy — xl — y 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


but as prob xl — y yl — x r it is evident that prob xy — xl — y 
will be — r we have therefore to seek 

prob xy 
 — r 

now the compound events concerned being in expression xl — y y — x 
and xy let us assume 

xl y yl x s 

xy w j 

our data then are prob x p prob y q prob s r and we are to find 
prob w 

the system gives on reduction 


ml y zl s sxy xl y 

 xyl — w wl — xy 


whence 

xl — l — s yl — xl — s sxy sl — xl — y xy 

w 

xy — 

 xys a l s xl ys xl y s 

 xys xl ys xyl s 

 xl l s 


in the expression of this development the coefficient — has been made to replace 
every equivalent form x here we have 

v xyl — s xl — ys — xys — xl — yl — s 

whence passing from logic to algebra 

xyl — s xl — ys xyl — s — xys

 xyl — s xl — ys — xys — xl — yl — s 

xyl s

from which we readily deduce 


prob 


p q — r 

w 


 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


whence we have 

prob xy p q — r 

 — r r 

for the value sought 

if in the same way we seek the probability that if a and b agree in their 
statement that statement will be false we must replace the second equation of 
the system by the following viz 

 xl y w 


the final logical equation will then be 

w xys s — ys xl — y — s 

 xys xy s xl ys 
lxlyls 

whence proceeding as before we finally deduce 


prob w 


 — p — q — r 


wherefore we have 

prob xl y p g r 

 — r r j 

for the value here sought 

these results are mutually consistent for since it is certain that the joint 
statement of a and b must be either true or false the second members of 
and ought by addition to make now we have identically 

p q — r — p — q — r 


 r 


 r 


it is probable from the simplicity of the results and that they might 
easily be deduced by the application of known principles but it is to be remarked 
that they do not fall directly within the scope of known methods the number 
of the data exceeds that of the simple events which they involve m cournot 
in his very able work “exposition cle la theorie des chances” has proposed 
in such cases as the above to select from the original premises different sets 
of data each set equal in number to the simple events which they involve to 
assume that those simple events are independent determine separately from the 
respective sets of the data their probabilities and comparing the different values 
thus found for the same elements judge how far the assumption of independence 
is justified this method can only approach to correctness when the said simple 
events prove according to the above criterion to be nearly or quite independent 
and in the questions of testimony and of judgment in which such an hypothesis 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


is adopted it seems doubtful whether it is justified by actual experience of the 
ways of men 

 ex — from observations made during a period of general sickness there 
was a probability p that any house taken at random in a particular district was 
visited by fever a probability q that it was visited by cholera and a probability 
r that it escaped both diseases and was not in a defective sanitary condition 
as regarded cleanliness and ventilation what is the probability that any house 
taken at random was in a defective sanitary condition 

with reference to any house let us appropriate the symbols x y z as follows 
viz 

the symbol x to the visitation of fever 

y ” cholera 

 defective sanitary condition 

the events whose probabilities are given are then denoted by x y and 
 — xl — — z the event whose probability is sought is z assume then 

 xl y z w 

then our data are 

prob x p prob y q prob w r 
and we are to find prob now 


 sl yw 
lalj 


 xyw xy w al y jjarl y w

the value of v deduced from the above is 

v xy — w xl — y — w — xy — w 

 — xl — yw — xl — y — w — w wl — xl — y 

and similarly reducing v x v y v w we get 

v x xl w v v ylw v w wlxl y 


 — w wl — xl — y 


furnishing the algebraic equations 

xl — w yl — w wl — xl — y 
p q r 

as respects those terms of the development characterized by the coefficients g 
i shall instead of collecting them into a single term present them for the sake 
of variety xvil in the form

chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


the value of prob will then be 


prob z 


 — xl — yl — w cx — w c — xylw 
 — w w — xl — y 


 


from and we deduce 


xj prlqr qlpr 

prob z cp c 


 — r 


 — r 


as the expression of the probability required if in this result we make c 
and c we find for an inferior limit of its value l p ykigo all jf we 
make c d we obtain for its superior limit — r 

 it appears from inspection of this solution that the premises chosen 
were exceedingly defective the constants c and d indicate this and the cor 
responding terms of the final logical equation show how the deficiency is to 
be supplied thus since 


xl — w xl — — xl — — z x 

 xy w xy xl y z xy 


we learn that c is the probability that if any house was visited by fever its 
sanitary condition is defective and that d is the probability that if any house 
was visited by cholera without fever its sanitary condition was defective 

if the terms of the logical development affected by the coefficient had been 
collected together as in the direct statement of the general rule the final solution 
would have assumed the following form 


prob z 


 — p — rl — q — r 
 — r 


 c p q 


pq 

 — r 


c here representing the probability that if a house was visited by either or both 
of the diseases mentioned its sanitary condition was defective this result is 
perfectly consistent with the former one and indeed the necessary equivalence 
of the different forms of solution presented in such cases may be formally estab 
lished 

the above solution may be verified in particular cases thus taking the 
second form if c we find prob z — r a correct result for if the presence 
of either fever or cholera certainly indicated a defective sanitary condition the 
probability that any house would be in a defective sanitary state would be 
simply equal to the probability that it was not found in that category denoted 
by z the probability of which would by the data be — r perhaps the general 
verification of the above solution would be difficult 

the constants p q and r in the above solution are subject to the conditions 


p r q r 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


 ex — given the probabilities of the premises of a hypothetical syllogism 
to find the probability of the conclusion 

let the syllogism in its naked form be as follows 

major premiss if the proposition y is true x is true 

minor premiss if the proposition z is true y is true 

conclusion if the proposition z is true x is true 

suppose the probability of the major premiss to be p that of the minor 
premiss q 

the data then are as follows representing the proposition x by x c and 
assuming c and d as arbitrary constants 

prob y c prob xy cp 

prob z d prob yz dq 

from which we are to determine 

prob xz prob xz 

or 

prob z d 


let us assume 

xy it yz v xz w 

then proceeding according to the usual method to determine w as a developed 
function of y z w and v the symbols corresponding to propositions whose 
probabilities are given we find 

w uzvy oitl — z — vy — uzvy

the solution of this system of equations gives 

prob w dpq ad — q 


whence 


prob xy 


 pq alq 


the value required in this expression the arbitrary constant a is the probability 
that if the proposition z is true and y false x is true in other words it is the 
probability that if the minor premiss is false the conclusion is true 

this investigation might have been greatly simplified by assuming the propo 
sition z to be true and then seeking the probability of x the data would have 
been simply 

prob y q prob xy pq 


whence we should have found prob x pq al — q it is evident that under 
the circumstances this mode of procedure would have been allowable but i have 
preferred to deduce the solution by the direct and unconditioned application of 
the method the result is one which ordinary reasoning verifies and which it 
does not indeed require a calculus to obtain general methods are apt to appear 
most cumbrous when applied to cases in which their aid is the least required 

let it be observed that the above method is equally applicable to the cate 
gorical syllogism and not to the syllogism only but to every form of deductive 
ratiocination given the probabilities separately attaching to the premises of 
any train of argument it is always possible by the above method to determine 
the consequent probability of the truth of a conclusion legitimately drawn from 
such premises it is not needful to remind the reader that the truth and the 
correctness of a conclusion are different things 

 one remarkable circumstance which presents itself in such applications 
deserves to be specially noticed it is that propositions which when true are 
equivalent are not necessarily equivalent when regarded only as probable this 
principle will be illustrated in the following example 

ex — given the probability p of the disjunctive proposition “either the 
proposition y is true or both the propositions x and y are false” required the 
probability of the conditional proposition “if the proposition x is true y is 
true” 

let x and y be appropriated to the propositions x and y respectively then 
we have 

prob y — xl — y p 
from which it is required to find the value of p lot y x v 


assumey — al — y t 


 


eliminating y we get 


 — xl — t 


whence 


 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


and proceeding in the usual way 

prob x — p cp 

where c is the probability that if either y is true or x and y false x is true 
next to find prob xy assume 


xy w 

eliminating y from and we get 

z t 


 


whence proceeding as above 


prob z cp 

c having the same interpretation as before hence 

prob xy cp 

prob x — p cp 

for the probability of the truth of the conditional proposition given 

now in the science of pure logic which as such is conversant only with 
truth and with falsehood the above disjunctive and conditional propositions are 
equivalent they are true and they are false together it is seen however from 
the above investigation that when the disjunctive proposition has a probability 
p the conditional proposition has a different and partly indefinite probability 
i pcp • nevertheless these expressions are such that when either of them be 
comes or the other assumes the same value the results are therefore 
perfectly consistent and the logical transformation serves to verify the formula 
deduced from the theory of probabilities 

the reader will easily prove by a similar analysis that if the probability of 
the conditional proposition were given as p that of the disjunctive proposition 
would be — c cp where c is the arbitrary probability of the truth of the 
proposition x 

 ex —required to determine the probability of an event x having 
given either the first or the first and second or the first second and third of 
the following data viz 

st the probability that the event x occurs or that it alone of the three 
events x y z fails is p 

nd the probability that the event y occurs or that it alone of the three 
events x y z fails is q 

rd the probability that the event z occurs or that it alone of the three 
events x y z fails is r 


solution of the first case 



chapter xviii elementary illustrations 


 


here we suppose that only the first of the above data is given we have 
then 

prob x l — xyz p 

to find prob x 


letx l — xyz s 

then eliminating yz as a single symbol we get 

xl — s 

hence 

t nb ’’ 

whence proceeding according to the rule we have 

prob x cp 

where c is the probability that if x occurs or alone fails the former of the two 
alternatives is the one that will happen the limits of the solution are evidently 
 and p 

this solution appears to give us no information beyond what unassisted 
good sense would have conveyed it is however all that the single datum here 
assumed really warrants us in inferring we shall in the next solution see how 
an addition to our data restricts within narrower limits the final solution 

solution of the second case 

here we assume as our data the equations 

prob x l — xyz p 

prob y l — yxz q 


let us write 


x l — xyz s 
y yxz q 

from the first of which we have by viii 

x l — xyzl — s sl — x — l — xyz

provided that for simplicity we write x for — x y for — y and so on now 
writing for — yz its value in constituents we have

second equation

and from the sum of these two equations we are to eliminate y and z 

if in that sum we make y z we get the result s t 

if in the same sum we make y z we get the result 

xs sx t 

if in the same sum we make y z we get 

xs sx xt tx 

and if lastly in the same sum we make y z we find 
xs sx tx tx or xs sx t 

these four expressions are to be multiplied together now the first and third 
may be multiplied in the following manner 

s t xs sx xt tx 

 xs xt s t sx tx by ix prop ii 

 xs xt sxt sxt 

again the second and fourth give by ix prop i 

xs sx t xs sx t 

 xs sx 


lastly and multiplied together give 

xs sxxs sxt xt txs 
 xs sxsxt xt txs 

 xs sxt 


whence the final equation is 

 — sx sl — fl — x 

which solved with reference to x gives 

 

 sl t a 

 st sl — t st sl t 
and proceeding with this according to the rule we have finally 


prob x p — q cpq

where c is the probability that if the event st happen x will happen now if we 
form the developed expression of st by multiplying the expressions for s and t 
together we find 

c prob that if x and y happen together or x and happen together and 
y fail or y and happen together and x fail the event x will happen 

the limits of prob x are evidently p — q and p 

this solution is more definite than the former one inasmuch as it contains 
a term unaffected by an arbitrary constant 

solution of the third case 

prob a — xyz p 

here the data are — prob y — yxz q 

prob — zxy r 

let us as before write x for — x c and assume 

x xyz s 
y yxz f 

 zxy u 

on reduction by viii we obtain the equation 
x xyzs sxyz yz yz 

 y yxzt tyzx xz xz 

 zxyu uzxy xy xy 

now instead of directly eliminating y and from the above equation let us 
in accordance with ix prop iii assume the result of that elimination to be 

exe lx 

then e will be found by making in the given equation x and eliminating y 
and from the resulting equation and e will be found by making in the given 
equation x and eliminating y and from the result first then making 
x we have 


s y yzt tyz yzu uyz 

and making in the first member of this equation successively y z ly 
 c and multiplying together the results we have the expression 

s t us t us t us t u 

which is equivalent to 

s t u s t u 

this is the expression for e we shall retain it in its present form it has already 
been shown by example viii that the actual reduction of such expressions 
by multiplication though convenient is not necessary

again in making x we have 

yzs syz yz yz yt ty zu uz 
from which by the same process of elimination we find for e the expression 
s t us t us t us t u 

the final result of the elimination of y and z from is therefore 

s i us t ux s i us i us us t wl — x 


whence we have

now by 


stu xp — s 

substitute in this equation the values of s t and u above determined and we 
have 


 p — q — ra — — p — ra — r — p — q a 

 p g r a 

an equation which determines a the values of s t and u are then given by 
 and their substitution in completes the solution of the problem 

 now a difficulty the bringing of which prominently before the reader has 
been one object of this investigation here arises how shall it be determined 
which root of the above equation ought to taken for the value of a to this 
difficulty some reference was made in the opening of the present chapter and it 
was intimated that its fuller consideration was reserved for the next one from 
which the following results are taken 

in order that the data of the problem may be derived from a possible expe 
rience the quantities p q and r must be subject to the following conditions 

 p — q — r 

l q p r 

 r — p — q 

moreover the value of a to be employed in the general solution must satisfy the 
following conditions 

a a a 

p—q—r q—p—r r—p—q 

now these two sets of conditions suffice for the limitation of the general 
solution it may be shown that the central equation furnishes but one 
value of a which does satisfy these conditions and that value of a is the one 
required 

let p — q — r be the least of the three coefficients of a given above then 

will be the greatest of those values above which we are to show 

 p — q t 

that there exists but one value of a let us write in the form 


 p — q — ra — — p — ra — r — p — ga — 

p q r a

and represent the first member by v 

assume a then v becomes 


 p — q — r 
p q r —

 p — q — r

 p — q r 


which is negative let a oo then v is positive and infinite 
again 


d v 

 ipqrl qprl rpqxl 

 similar positive terms 

which expression is positive between the limits a p i i q r and a oo 

if then we construct a curve whose abscissa shall be measured by a and 
whose ordinates by v that curve will between the limits specified pass from 
below to above the abscissa a its convexity always being downwards hence it 
will but once intersect the abscissa a within those limits and the equation 
will therefore have but one root thereto corresponding 

the solution is therefore expressed by a being that root of which 
satisfies the conditions and st and u being given by the interpre 
tation of c may be deduced in the usual way 

it appears from the above that the problem is in all cases more or less 
indeterminate 



chapter xix 


of statistical conditions 


 by the term statistical conditions i mean those conditions which must con 
nect the numerical data of a problem in order that those data may be consistent 
with each other and therefore such as statistical observations might actually 
have furnished the determination of such conditions constitutes an important 
problem the solution of which to an extent sufficient at least for the require 
ments of this work i purpose to undertake in the present chapter regarding it 
partly as an independent object of speculation but partly also as a necessary 
supplement to the theory of probabilities already in some degree exemplified 
the nature of the connexion between the two subjects may be stated as follows 

 there are innumerable instances and one of the kind presented itself 
in the last chapter ex in which the solution of a question in the theory 
of probabilities is finally dependent upon the solution of an algebraic equation 
of an elevated degree in such cases the selection of the proper root must 
be determined by certain conditions partly relating to the numerical values 
assigned in the data partly to the due limitation of the element required the 
discovery of such conditions may sometimes be effected by unaided reasoning 
for instance if there is a probability p of the occurrence of an event a and a 
probability q of the concurrence of the said event a and another event b it is 
evident that we must have 

p q 

but for the general determination of such relations a distinct method is re 
quired and this we proceed to establish 

as derived from actual experience the probability of any event is the result 
of a process of approximation it is the limit of the ratio of the number of cases 
in which the event is observed to occur to the whole number of equally possible 
cases which observation records a limit to which we approach the more nearly 
as the number of observations is increased now let the symbol n prefixed to 
the expression of any class represent the number of individuals contained in 
that class thus x representing men and y white beings let us assume 

nx number of men 

nxy number of white men 

nxl — y number of men who are not white and so on 


 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


in accordance with this notation nl will represent the number of individuals 
contained in the universe of discourse and y will represent the probability 
that any individual being selected out of that universe of being denoted by 
nl is a man if observation has not made us acquainted with the total values 
of nx and nl then the probability in question is the limit to which 
approaches as the number of individual observations is increased 

in like manner if as will generally be supposed in this chapter x represent 
an event of a particular kind observed nx will represent the number of occur 
rences of that event nl the number of observed events equally probable of 
all kinds and yjy or its limit the probability of the occurrence of the event x 

hence it is clear that any conclusions which may be deduced respecting the 
ratios of the quantities nx ny n c may be converted into conclusions 
respecting the probabilities of the events represented by x y c thus if we 
should find such a relation as the following viz 

nx ny nl 

expressing that the number of times in which the event x occurs and the number 
of times in which the event y occurs are together less than the number of 
possible occurrences nl we might thence deduce the relation 

nx ny 
nl nl ’ 
orprob x prob y 

and generally any such statistical relations as the above will be converted into 
relations connecting the probabilities of the events concerned by changing nl 
into and any other symbol nx into prob x 

 first then we shall investigate a method of determining the numerical 
relations of classes or events and more particularly the major and minor limits 
of numerical value secondly we shall apply the method to the limitation of the 
solutions of questions in the theory of probabilities 

it is evident that the symbol n is distributive in its operation thus we have 

nxy — al — y nxy n — xl — y 
nx — y nx — nxy 

and so on the number of things contained in any class resolvable into distinct 
groups or portions is equal to the sum of the numbers of things found in those 
separate portions it is evident further that any expression formed of the logical 
symbols x y c may be developed or expanded in any way consistent with 
the laws of the symbols and the symbol n applied to each term of the result 
provided that any constant multiplier which may appear be placed outside the 
symbol n without affecting the value of the result the expression nl should 
it appear will of course represent the number of individuals contained in the 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


universe thus 


n — xl — y n — x — y xy 

 nl — nx — ny nxy 

again nxy — xl — y nl — x — y xy 

 nl — nx — ny nxy 

in the last member the term nxy indicates twice the number of individuals 
contained in the class xy 

 we proceed now to investigate the numerical limits of classes whose logical 
expression is given in this inquiry the following principles are of fundamental 
importance 

st if all the members of a given class possess a certain property x the 
total number of individuals contained in the class x will be a superior limit of 
the number of individuals contained in the given class 

nd a minor limit of the number of individuals in any class y will be found 
by subtracting a major numerical limit of the contrary class — y from the 
number of individuals contained in the universe 

to exemplify these principles let us apply them to the following problem 

problem — given nl nx and ny required the superior and inferior 
limits of nxy 

here our data are the number of individuals contained in the universe of 
discourse the number contained in the class x and the number in the class y 
and it is required to determine the limits of the number contained in the class 
composed of the individuals that are found at once in the class x and in the 
class y 

by principle i this number cannot exceed the number contained in the class 
x nor can it exceed the number contained in the class y its major limit will 
then be the least of the two values nx and y 

by principle ii a minor limit of the class xy will be given by the expression 

nl — major limit of xl — y yl — x — xl — y 

since xl — y y — x — — xl — y is the complement of the class xy ie 
what it wants to make up the universe 

now xl — y — xl — y — y we have therefore for 

nl — major limit of — y yl — x 

 nl — nl — y — major limit of y — x 

the major limit of yl — x is the least of the two values ny and n — x let 
ny be the least then becomes 

nl nl y ny 

 nl — n ny — ny 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


secondly let n — x be less than ny then 

major limit of ny — x n — x 
therefore becomes 


nl — n — y — n — x 

 rl — nl ny — n ra 

 na ny — nl 

the minor limit of nxy is therefore either or n x ny — n according 
as ny is less or greater than n — a or which is an equivalent condition 
according as nx is greater or less than n — y 

now as is necessarily a minor limit of the numerical value of any class it 
is sufficient to take account of the second of the above expressions for the minor 
limit of nxy we have therefore 

major limit of nxy least of values nx and ny 

minor limit of nxy n x ny — nl 


proposition i 

 to express the major and minor limits of a class represented by any 
constituent of the symbols x y z c having given the values of nx ny 
nz c and nl 

consider first the constituent xyz 

it is evident that the major numerical limit will be the least of the values 
nx ny nz 

the minor numerical limit may be deduced as in the previous problem but 
it may also be deduced from the solution of that problem thus 

minor limit of nxyz nxy nz — n 

now this means that nxyz is at least as great as the expression nxy nz — 
n but nxy is at least as great as nx ny — nl therefore nxyz is 
at least as great as 


nx ny — n nz — nl 
or nx ny nz — nl 

 the above expression for the minor limit of nxy is applied by professor de morgan by 
whom it appears to have been first given to the syllogistic form 

most men in a certain company have coats 

most men in the same company have waistcoats 

therefore some in the company have coats and waistcoats 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


hence we have 

minor limit of nxyz nx ny nz — nl 

by extending this mode of reasoning we shall arrive at the following conclu 
sions 

st the major numerical limit of the class represented by any constituent 
will be found by prefixing n separately to each factor of the constituent and 
taking the least of the resulting values 

nd the minor limit will be found by adding all the values above mentioned 
together and subtracting from the result as many less one times the value of 
nl 

thus we should have 

major limit of nxyl — z least of the values nx ny and n — z 

minor limit of nxy — z nx ny nl — z — nl 

 nx ny — nz — nl 

in the use of general symbols it is perhaps better to regard all the values 
nx ny n — z as major limits of nxy — since in fact it cannot 
exceed any of them i shall in the following investigations adopt this mode of 
expression 


proposition ii 

 to determine the major numerical limit of a class expressed by a series 
of constituents of the symbols x y z c the values ofnx ny nz c 
and n being given 

evidently one mode of determining such a limit would be to form the least 
possible sum of the major limits of the several constituents thus a major limit 
of the expression 

nxy xl y 

would be found by adding the least of the two values nx ny furnished by the 
first constituent to the least of the two values nl — x nl — y furnished by 
the second constituent if we do not know which is in each case the least value 
we must form the four possible sums and reject any of these which are equal to 
or exceed rl thus in the above example we should have 

nx nl — x nl 
nx n — y nl nx — ny 
ny nl — y nl ny — nx 
ny n y rl 

rejecting the first and last of the above values we have 

il nx — ny and nl ny — nx 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


for the expressions required one of which will unless nx ny be less than 
nl and the other greater the least must of course be taken 

when two or more of the constituents possess a common factor as x that 
factor can only as is obvious from principle i furnish a single term nx in the 
final expression of the major limit thus if nx appear as a major limit in two 
or more constituents we must in adding those limits together replace nx nx 
by nx and so on take for example the expression nxy al — yz the 
major limits of this expression immediately furnished by addition would be — 

 nx ny nx 

 nx n — y ny nl — y 

 nx nz ny nz 

of these the first and sixth only need be retained the second third and fourth 
being greater than the first and the fifth being equal to nl the limits are 
therefore 

n x and ny nz 

and of these two values the last supposing it to be less than nl must be 
taken 

these considerations lead us to the following rule 

rule — take one factor from each constituent and prefix to it the symbol 
n add the several terms or results thus formed together rejecting all repetitions 
of the same term the sum thus obtained will be a major limit of the expression 
and the least of all such sums will be the major limit to be employed 

thus the major limits of the expression 

xyz xl y z xl y z 


would be 


nx n — y and nx nl — z 
or nx il — ny and nx nl — nz 

if we began with ny selected from the first term and took nx from the 
second we should have to take n — y from the third term and this would 
give 

ny n x nl — y or nl nx 

but as this result exceeds nl which is an obvious major limit to every class 
it need not be taken into account 

proposition iii 

 to find the minor numerical limit of any class expressed by constituents 
of the symbols x y z having given nxny nz nl 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


this object may be effected by the application of the preceding proposition 
combined with principle ii but it is better effected by the following method 

let any two constituents which differ from one another only by a single 
factor be added so as to form a single class term as xl — y xy form x 
and this species of aggregation having been carried on as far as possible ie 
there having been selected out of the given series of constituents as many sums 
of this kind as can be formed each such sum comprising as many constituents 
as can be collected into a single term without regarding whether any of the 
said constituents enter into the composition of other terms let these ultimate 
aggregates together with those constituents which do not admit of being thus 
added together be written down as distinct terms then the several minor limits 
of those terms deduced by prop i will be the minor limits of the expression 
given and one only of those minor limits will at the same time be positive 

thus from the expression xy — xy — xl — y we can form the 
aggregates y and — x by respectively adding the first and second terms to 
gether and the second and third hence ny and n — x will be the minor 
limits of the expression given again if the expression given were 

xyz xl — yz — xyz l — ® — yz 

 xyl z xl y z 

we should obtain by addition of the first four terms the single term by addition 
of the first and fifth term the single term xy and by addition of the fourth and 
sixth terms the single term — al — y and there is no other way in which 
constituents can be collected into single terms nor are there are any constituents 
left which have not been thus taken account of the three resulting terms give 
as the minor limits of the given expression the values 

nz nx ny n 

andnl — x n — y — nl or nl — nx — ny 

 the proof of the above rule consists in the proper application of the 
following principles — st the minor limit of any collection of constituents 
which admit of being added into a single term will obviously be the minor 
limit of that single term this explains the first part of the rule nd the 
minor limit of the sum of any two terms which either are distinct constituents 
or consist of distinct constituents but do not admit of being added together 
will be the sum of their respective minor limits if those minor limits are both 
positive but if one be positive and the other negative it will be equal to the 
positive minor limit alone for if the negative one were added the value of the 
limit would be diminished i e it would be less for the sum of two terms than 
for a single term now whenever two constituents differ in more than one factor 
so as not to admit of being added together the minor limits of the two cannot 
be both positive thus let the terms be xyz and — xl — yz which differ in 
two factors the minor limit of the first is nx y z — that of the second 
n — x — y z — or 

st nx y — — — z nd n — x — y — — z 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


if nx y — is positive n — x — y is negative and the second must be 
negative if nx y — is negative the first is negative and similarly for cases 
in which a larger number of factors are involved it may in this manner be 
shown that according to the mode in which the aggregate terms are formed in 
the application of the rule no two minor limits of distinct terms can be added 
together for either those terms will involve some common constituent in which 
case it is clear that we cannot add their minor limits together — or the minor 
limits of the two will not be both positive in which case the addition would be 
useless 

proposition iv 

 given the respective numbers of individuals comprised in any classes s 
t c logically defined to deduce a system of numerical limits of any other 
class w also logically defined 

as this is the most general problem which it is meant to discuss in the 
present chapter the previous inquiries being merely introductory to it and the 
succeeding ones occupied with its application it is desirable to state clearly its 
nature and design 

when the classes s tw are said to be logically defined it is meant that 
they are classes so defined as to enable us to write down their symbolical expres 
sions whether the classes in question be simple or compound by the general 
method of this treatise the symbol w can then be determined directly as a 
developed function of the symbols s t c in the form 

w a ob — c — d 

wherein a b c and d are formed of the constituents of s t c how from 
such an expression the numerical limits of w may in the most general manner 
be determined will be considered hereafter at present we merely purpose 
to show how far this object can be accomplished on the principles developed 
in the previous propositions such an inquiry being sufficient for the purposes 
of this work for simplicity i shall found my argument upon the particular 
development 

w st osl — t — st — sl — t 

in which all the varieties of coefficients present themselves 

of the constituent — sl — t which has for its coefficient jj it is implied 
that some none or all of the class denoted by that constituent are found in 
w it is evident that nw will have its highest numerical value when all the 
members of the class denoted by — sl — are found in w moreover as 
none of the individuals contained in the classes denoted by sl — t and — st 
are found in w the superior numerical limits of w will be identical with those 
of the class st — sl — t they are therefore 


ns nl — t and nt nl — s 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


in like manner a system of superior numerical limits of the development a 
ob gc d may be found from those of a c by prop 

again any minor numerical limit of w will by principle ii be given by the 
expression 

n — major limit of n — w 

but the development of w being given by that of — w will obviously be 
 w oa b d 

this may be directly proved by the method of prop chap x hence 

minor limit of nw n — major limit b c 

 minor limit of a d 

by principle ii since the classes a d and b c are supplementary thus 
the minor limit of the second member of would be nt and generalizing 
this mode of reasoning we have the following result 

a system of minor limits of the development 

a obcd 

will be given by the minor limits of a d 

this result may also be directly inferred for of minor numerical limits we 
are bound to seek the greatest now we obtain in general a higher minor limit 
by connecting the class d with a in the expression of w a combination which 
as shown in various examples of the logic we are permitted to make than we 
otherwise should obtain 

finally as the concluding term of the development of w indicates the equa 
tion d it is evident that nd hence we have 

minor limit of nd 

and this equation treated by prop gives the requisite conditions among the 
numerical elements ns nt c in order that the problem may be real and 
may embody in its data the results of a possible experience 

thus from the term jjl — st in the second member of we should deduce 

nl — s nt — nl 

 nt ns 

these conclusions may be embodied in the following rule 

 rule — determine the expression of the class w as a developed logical 
function of the symbols s t c in the form 

w a b c d 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


then will 

maj lim w maj lim a c 

min lim w min lim a d 

the necessary numerical conditions among the data being given by the inequality 

min lim d n 

to apply the above method to the limitation of the solutions of questions 
in probabilities it is only necessary to replace in each of the formula nx by 
prob x ny by prob y c and finally nl by the application being 
however of great importance it may be desirable to exhibit in the form of a 
rule the chief results of transformation 

 given the probabilities of any events s t c whereof another event w 
is a developed logical function in the form 

w a ob — c — z 

required the systems of superior and inferior limits of prob w and the condi 
tions among the data 

solution — the superior limits of prob a c and the inferior limits of 
prob a d will form two such systems as are sought the conditions among 
the constants in the data will be given by the inequality 

inf lim prob d 


in the application of these principles we have always 

inf lim prob x x x n prob x prob x ¦ ¦ ¦ prob x n — n — 

moreover the inferior limits can only be determined from single terms ei 
ther given or formed by aggregation superior limits are included in the form 
 prob x prob x applying only to symbols which are different and are taken 
from different terms in the expression whose superior limit is sought thus the 
superior limits of prob xyz xl — y — z are 

prob x prob y prob — z and prob z prob — y 

let it be observed that if in the last case we had taken prob z from the first 
term and prob — z from the second — a connexion not forbidden — we 
should have had as their sum which as a result would be useless because a 
priori necessary it is obvious that we may reject any limits which do not fall 
between and 

let us apply this method to ex case iii of the last chapter 

the final logical solution is 




chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


the data being 


prob s p prob t q prob u r 

we shall seek both the numerical limits of x and the conditions connecting 
p q and r the superior limits of x are according to the rule given by those 
of stu stu they are therefore 

p q — r r — q 

the inferior limits of x are given by those of 

stu stu stu stu 

we may collect the first and third of these constituents in the single term 
si and the second and third in the single term su the inferior limits of x must 
then be deduced separately from the terms sl — t sl — u — stu which 
give 


plq 

or 


p — r— l—pqr— 

p — q p — r and g r — p— 


finally the conditions among the constants p q and r are given by the 
terms 

stu stu stu 

from which by the rule we deduce 

p — q r — p q — r — — p q r — 

orl g — p — r j — p — q p— q — r 


these are the limiting conditions employed in the analysis of the final solution 
the conditions by which in that solution a is limited were determined however 
simply from the conditions that the quantities s t and u should be positive 
narrower limits of that quantity might in all probability have been deduced 
from the above investigation 

 the following application is taken from an important problem the so 
lution of which will be given in the next chapter there are given 


prob x ci prob y c prob s cp prob t c p 


together with the logical equation 

z stxy stxy stxy st 
 j stxy stxy stxy stxy stxy 
 i stxy stxy stxy stxy 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


and it is required to determine the conditions among the constants ci c pi 
p and the major and minor limits of z 

first let us seek the conditions among the constants confining our attention 
to the terms whose coefficients are g we readily form by the aggregation of 
constituents the following terms viz 

s — x i tly sylt txlsi 

nor can we form any other terms which are not included under these hence 
the conditions among the constants are 

ns n — x — n 
nt n — y — nl 
ns ny n — t — nl 
nt nx nl — s — nl 

now replace nx by ci ny by c ns by cipi nt by cp and n by 
 and we have after slight reductions 

cp ci cp c 

c p c l p cp ci pi 

such are then the requisite conditions among the constants 

again the major limits of z are identical with those of the expression 

stxy sl — tx — y — sfl — xy 

which if we bear in mind the conditions 

ns nx nt ny 

above determined will be found to be 

ns nt or cipi cp 

ns n — x or — cil — pint n — y or — c l — £ 

lastly to ascertain the minor limits of z we readily form from the con 
stituents whose coefficients are or j the single terms s and t nor can any 
other terms not included under these be formed by selection or aggregation 
hence for the minor limits of we have the values cipi and cp 

 it is to be observed that the method developed above does not always 
assign the narrowest limits which it is possible to determine but it in all 
cases i believe sufficiently limits the solutions of questions in the theory of 
probabilities 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


the problem of the determination of the narrowest limits of numerical ex 
tension of a class is however always reducible to a purely algebraical form 
thus resuming the equations 

w a ob — c d 

let the highest inferior numerical limit of w be represented by the formula ans 
bnt dn wherein abcd are numerical constants to be determined 
and s t c the logical symbols of which a b c d are constituents then 

ans bnt cinl minor limit of a subject 

to the condition d 


hence if we develop the function 

as bt d 

reject from the result all constituents which are found in d the coefficients of 
those constituents which remain and are found also in a ought not individually 
to exceed unity in value and the coefficients of those constituents which remain 
and which are not found in a should individually not exceed in value hence 
we shall have a series of inequalities of the form and another series of the 
form g and g being linear functions of a c c then those values of 
a b d which while satisfying the above conditions give to the function 

ans bnt dn 

its highest value must be determined and the highest value in question will 
be the highest minor limit of w to the above we may add the relations sim

 the following somewhat complicated example will show how the limita

events represented by the general functional form x x n or 

 the author regrets the loss of a manuscript written about four years ago in which this 
method he believes was developed at considerable length his recollection of the contents is 
almost entirely confined to the impression that the principle of the method was the same as 
above described and that its sufficiency was proved the prior methods of this chapter are 
it is almost needless to say easier though certainly less general 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


adopting a previous notation the data of the problem are 

prob xi x x n pi prob x n x x n p n 

and prob jx x n is required 

assume generally 


x r x x n s r 

j w 

we hence obtain the collective logical equation of the problem 

£ x r x x n s r s r x r — x xn w wj 

from this equation we must eliminate the symbols xi x n and determine w 
as a developed logical function of si s n 

let us represent the result of the aforesaid elimination in the form 

ew e — w 

then will e be the result of the elimination of the same symbols from the 
equation 


 x r x x n s r s r x r — x xn — f 

now e will be the product of the coefficients of all the constituents consid 
ered with reference to the symbols x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n which are found in the devel 
opment of the first member of the above equation moreover j and therefore 
 — will consist of a series of such constituents having unity for their respec 
tive coefficients in determining the forms of the coefficients in the development 
of the first member of it will be convenient to arrange them in the following 
manner 

st the coefficients of constituents found in — f 

nd the coefficient of si x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n if found in 

rd the coefficients of constituents found in j excluding the constituent 
x x • • • x n 

the above is manifestly an exhaustive classification 

first then the coefficient of any constituent found in — f will in the 
development of the first member of be of the form 

 positive terms derived from 

hence every such coefficient may be replaced by unity prop i chap ix 

secondly the coefficient of x x n if found in in the development of the 
first member of will be 


£ 


or si s s n 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


thirdly the coefficient of any other constituent x xi xi ¦ ¦ x n found 
in in the development of the first member of will be si sj si s n 

now it is seen that e is the product of all the coefficients above determined 
but as the coefficients of those constituents which are not found in reduce to 
unity e may be regarded as the product of the coefficients of those constituents 
which are found in from the mode in which those coefficients are formed 
we derive the following rule for the determination of e viz in each constituent 
found in except the constituent x x ¦ ¦ x n for x± write si for oti write si 
and so on and add the results but for the constituent xx ¦ ¦ x n if it occur 
in write si s s n the product of all these sums is e 

to find e we must in make w and eliminate xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n from the 
reduced equation that equation will be 

x r x x n s r s r x r — x x n 

hence e will be formed from the constituents in — i e from the constituents 
not found in in the same way as e is formed from the constituents found in 


consider next the equation 

ew e — w 


this gives 


w 


e’ 

e e‘ 


 


now e and e are functions of the symbols sis s n the expansion 
of the value of w will therefore consist of all the constituents which can be 
formed out of those symbols with their proper coefficients annexed to them as 
determined by the rule of development 

moreover e and e are each formed by the multiplication of factors and 
neither of them can vanish unless some one of the factors of which it is composed 
vanishes again any factor as si s n can only vanish when all the terms 
by the addition of which it is formed vanish together since in development we 
attribute to these terms the values and only it is further evident that 
no two factors differing from each other can vanish together thus the factors 
si s • • • s n and si s s n cannot simultaneously vanish for the 
former cannot vanish unless si or si but the latter cannot vanish 
unless si 

first let us determine the coefficient of the constituent sis s n in the 
development of the value of w 

the simultaneous assumption si s s„ would cause the 
factor si s s n to vanish if this should occur in e or e and no other 
factor under the same assumption would vanish but si s s„ does not 
occur as a factor of either e or e neither of these quantities therefore can 
vanish and therefore the expression e e is neither nor 

wherefore the coefficient of s s s n in the expanded value of w may be 
represented by q 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


secondly let us determine the coefficient of the constituent s± s ¦ ¦ ¦ s n the 
assumptions si s s n would cause the factor si s • • • s„ to 
vanish now this factor is found in e and not in e whenever f contains both 
the constituents aq x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n and aq x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n here then e e becomes § or 
 the factor si s • ¦ ¦ s n is found in e and not in e if contains neither 
of the constituents x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n and aq aq ¦ ¦ ¦ x n here then e e becomes sg 
or lastly the factor si s ¦ ¦ ¦ s n is contained in both e and e if one of 
the constituents aq x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n and aq aq ¦ ¦ ¦ x n is found in p and one is not here 
then e f e becomes 

the coefficient of the constituent si ss n will therefore be l or j 
according as contains both the constituents aq x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n and aq aq ¦ ¦ ¦ x n or 
neither of them or one of them and not the other 

lastly to determine the coefficient of any other constituent as si sj 

the assumptions si s sji s n would cause the 
factor si si sji s n to vanish now this factor is found in e if the 
constituent x xi xi x n is found in f and in e if the said constituent 
is not found in j in the former case we have e ff e in the latter case 
we have 

hence the coefficient of any other constituent s si si s n is or 
according as the similar constituent x x xi ¦ x n is or is not found in f 

we may therefore practically determine the value of w in the following 
manner rejecting from the given expression of f the constituents xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x c 
and x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n should both or either of them be contained in it let the symbols 
x± xx n in the result be changed into si s ¦ ¦ ¦ s n respectively let 
the coefficients of the constituents si s s n and si s ¦ ¦ s n be determined 
according to the special rules for those cases given above and let every other 
constituent have for its coefficient the result will be the value of w as a 
function of si s • s n 

as a particular case let x it is required from the given data to 
determine the probability of the event x 

the symbol x expanded in terms of the entire series of symbols xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 
will generate all the constituents of those symbols which have x as a factor 
among those constituents will be found the constituent x± x ¦ • ¦ x n but not 
the constituent x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

hence in the expanded value of x as a function of the symbols s± s ¦ ¦ ¦ s n 
the constituent si s ¦ ¦ ¦ s n will have the coefficient g and the constituent 
si s s n the coefficient 

if from x we reject the constituent aq xx n the result will be aq — 
aqaq • • ¦ x n and changing therein aq into si c we have si — ss s n for the 
corresponding portion of the expression of aq as a function of si s s n 

hence the final expression for aq is 

 

 si — ss • • ¦ s n q s s • • • sn q sls ¦ s n 

 constituents whose coefficients are 


 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


the sum of all the constituents in the above expansion whose coefficients 
are either or g will be — s s • ¦ • s n 

we shall therefore have the following algebraic system for the determination 
of prob x viz 


prob x 


si — ss s n css s n 
 — ss ¦ • s n 


 


with the relations 


si s s n 

pi p pn 

 — s s s„ a 


it will be seen that the relations for the determination of si s s n are quite 
independent of the form of the function j and the values of these quantities 
determined once will serve for all possible problems in which the data are the 
same however the qucesita of those problems may vary the nature of that 
event or combination of events whose probability is sought will affect only the 
form of the function in which the determined values of si s s n are to be 
substituted we have from 

sl — pl a s p x • • • sn — pn a 


whence 


or 


 plal p a p n x a 


 a pial p a p n a 


from which equation the value of a is to be determined 

supposing this value determined the value of prob x will be 

pi cpip • ¦ p n a” 


 pial p a p n a ’ 
or on reduction by 

prob xi pi cpip ¦ ¦ p n a 


 


 


let us next seek the conditions which must be fulfilled among the constants 
pi p ¦ ¦ pri and the limits of the value of prob x 

as there is but one term with the coefficient there is but one condition 
among the constants viz 


minor limit — sil — s ¦ • ¦ s„ 

nl — si nl — s nl — s n — n lnl 
n nsi — ns ¦ ¦ ¦ ns n 

pi p ¦ ¦ ¦ pn 


or 

or 

whence 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


the condition required 

the major limit of prob x is the major limit of the sum of those con 
stituents whose coefficients are or but that sum is si 

hence 

major limit prob x major limit si p 

the minor limit of prob x will be identical with the minor limit of the ex 
pression 

si sis s n sil s s n 

a little attention will show that the different aggregates terms which can 
be formed out of the above each including the greatest possible number of 
constituents will be the following viz 


sils sils sils n s l s s n 

from these we deduce the following expressions for the minor limit viz 

p p plpplpn p p ¦ • ¦ pn 

the value of prob x will therefore not fall short of any of these values 
nor exceed the value of p± 

instead however of employing these conditions we may directly avail our 
selves of the principle stated in the demonstration of the general method in 
probabilities the condition that si s s n must each be less than unity re 
quires that a should be less than each of the quantities — a jl and the 
condition that si s s n must each be greater than requires that a should 
also be greater than now pi p p n being proper fractions satisfying the 
condition 

pl p ¦ ¦ ¦ pn 

it may be shown that but one positive value of a can be deduced from the central 
equation which shall be less than each of the quantities that 

value of a is therefore the one required 

to prove this let us consider the equation 


l pial p a p n a a 


when a the first member vanishes and the equation is satisfied let 
us examine the variations of the first member between the limits a and 
a a supposing p the greatest of the values p p p n ¦ representing the 
first member of the equation by v we have 


dv 

d 


pll pa pn a pn pia pn a 


which when a assumes the form —p — p — p n and is negative in 
value 



chapter xix of statistical conditions 


 


again we have 


d v 

da 


plp i p p„a c 


consisting of a series of terms which under the given restrictions with reference 
to the value of a are positive 

lastly when a — we have 


v — 


 

pi 


which is positive 

from all this it appears that if we construct a curve the ordinates of which 
shall represent the value of v corresponding to the abscissa a that curve will 
pass through the origin and will for small values of a lie beneath the abscissa 
its convexity will between the limits a and a — be downwards and 


at the extreme limit a the curve will be above the abscissa its ordinate being 
positive it follows from this description that it will intersect the abscissa once 
and only once within the limits specified viz between the values a and 

a £ 


the solution of the problem is therefore expressed by the value of a be 
ing that root of the equation which lies within the limits and a j l 
the constant c is obviously the probability that if the events aq x ¦ ¦ • x n 
all happen or all fail they will all happen 

this determination of the value of a suffices for all problems in which the data 
are the same as in the one just considered it is as from previous discussions we 
are prepared to expect a determination independent of the form of the function 
 let us as another example suppose 


 or aql x ¦¦¦ x n x n l aq x n i 


this is equivalent to requiring the probability that of the events aq aq x n 
one and only one will happen the value of w will obviously be 

w sil s s n s n si s„i si s„ 

from which we should have 


prob aql x x n a„l aq x„i 
 sil s s n s n l sj s ra i 

 si s„ 

 pial p a p n a p„a pia p„ia

pila p a p„la

this solution serves well to illustrate the remarks made in the introductory 
chapter i the essential difficulties of the problem are founded in the nature 
of its data and not in that of its quaesita the central equation by which a 
is determined and the peculiar discussions connected therewith are equally 
pertinent to every form which that problem can be made to assume by varying 
the interpretation of the arbitrary elements in its original statement

problems relating to the connexion of 
causes and effects 


 so to apprehend in all particular instances the relation of cause and effect as 
to connect the two extremes in thought according to the order in which they are 
connected in nature for the modus operandi is and must ever be unknown to 
us is the final object of science this treatise has shown that there is special 
reference to such an object in the constitution of the intellectual faculties there 
is a sphere of thought which comprehends things only as coexistent parts of a 
universe but there is also a sphere of thought chap xi in which they are 
apprehended as links of an unbroken and to human appearance an endless 
chain — as having their place in an order connecting them both with that which 
has gone before and with that which shall follow after in the contemplation of 
such a series it is impossible not to feel the preeminence which is due above 
all other relations to the relation of cause and effect 

here i propose to consider in their abstract form some problems in which 
the above relation is involved there exists among such problems as might 
be anticipated from the nature of the relation with which they are concerned 
a wide diversity from the probabilities of causes assigned a priori or given 
by experience and their respective probabilities of association with an effect 
contemplated it may be required to determine the probability of that effect 
and this either st absolutely or ndly under given conditions to such an 
object some of the earlier of the following problems relate on the other hand 
it may be required to determine the probability of a particular cause or of some 
particular connexion among a system of causes from observed effects and the 
known tendencies of the said causes singly or in connexion to the production of 
such effects this class of questions will be considered in a subsequent portion 
of the chapter and other forms of the general inquiry will also be noticed i 
would remark that although these examples are designed chiefly as illustrations 
of a method no regard has been paid to the question of ease or convenience in 
the application of that method on the contrary they have been devised with 
whatever success as types of the class of problems which might be expected to 
arise from the study of the relation of cause and effect in the more complex of 
its actual and visible manifestations 


 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


 problem i the probabilities of two causes a and a are ci and c 
respectively the probability that if the cause ai present itself an event e 
will accompany it whether as a consequence of the cause a or not is p and 
the probability that if the cause a present itself that event e will accompany 
it whether as a consequence of it or not is p moreover the event e cannot 
appear in the absence of both the causes a and a required the probability 
of the event e 

the solution of what this problem becomes in the case in which the causes 
a a are mutually exclusive is well known to be 

prob e cipi cp 

and it expresses a particular case of a fundamental and very important principle 
in the received theory of probabilities here it is proposed to solve the problem 
free from the restriction above stated 

let us represent 

the cause a by x 

the cause a by y 

the effect e by z 

then we have the following numerical data 

prob x ci prob y c 

prob xz cipi prob yz c p 

again it is provided that if the causes a a are both absent the effect e does 
not occur whence we have the logical equation 

 xl y vl z 


or eliminating v 


z xly 


now assume 


xz s yz t 


 

 


lr the mode in which such data as the above might be furnished by experience is easily 
conceivable opposite the window of the room in which i write is a field liable to be overflowed 
from two causes distinct but capable of being combined viz floods from the upper sources 
of the river lee and tides from the ocean suppose that observations made on n separate 
occasions have yielded the following results on a occasions the river was swollen by freshets 
and on p of those occasions it was inundated whether from this cause or not on b occasions 
the river was swollen by the tide and on q of those occasions it was inundated whether from 
this cause or not supposing then that the field cannot be inundated in the absence of 
both the causes above mentioned let it be required to determine the total probability of its 
inundation 

here the elements a b p q of the general problem represent the ratios 

a p b q 
at ’ a n b 

or rather the values to which those ratios approach as the value of n is indefinitely increased

then reducing these equations viii and connecting the result with 

xz — s sl — xz yz — t t — yz z — al — y 

from this equation must be determined as a developed logical function of 
x y s and t and its probability thence deduced by means of the data 

prob x ci prob y c prob s cipi prob t c p

from this result we find xvii

whence passing from logic to algebra we have the following system of equa

stxy stxy stxy stxy 
clpl cp 

stxy stxy stxy stxy stxy stxy st

from which we must eliminate s t x y and v

we know that

and thus from the above system of equations we may deduce 
u cipi u cp — u 

whence we have on equating the product of the three first members to the cube 
of the last 

ss tpxxyy 


 v 

u cipiti cp u 

again from the system we have

whence proceeding as before

 v 


 cl cp ztl c cp ucipi cp u 
equating the values of v in and we have 

u cipxu c p u 
 ci pi u c l p ucip c p u 


 


 


which may be more conveniently written in the form 

q cipiq c p ci pi u c p u q 
cp c p — u — u 

from this equation the value of u may be found it remains only to determine 
which of the roots must be taken for this purpose 

 it has been shown xix that the quantity u in order that it may 
represent the probability required in the above case must exceed each of the 
quantities cipi c p and fall short of each of the quantities — cil — pi 
 — c l — p and c p c p the condition among the constants moreover 
being that the three last quantities must individually exceed each of the two 
former ones now i shall show that these conditions being satisfied the final 
equation has but one root which falls within the limits assigned that root 
will therefore be the required value of u 

let us represent the lower limits cipi c p by a b respectively and the 
upper limits — cil — pi — c l— p and cipi c p by a b p respectively 
then the general equation may be expressed in the form 

 u — a u — b — u — a — ub — uc — u 

orl — a — bu — ab — ab — a — bcu ab — ab c 


representing the first member of the above equation by v we have 


d v 

du 


 — a — b 


 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


now let us suppose a the highest of the lower limits of u a the lowest of its 
higher limits and trace the progress of the values of v between the limits u a 
and u a 

when u a we see from the form of the first member of that v is 
negative and when u a we see that v is positive between those limits v 

• • • • • j t t 

varies continuously without becoming infinite and ay is always of the same 
sign 

hence if u represent the abscissa v the ordinate of a plane curve it is 
evident that the curve will pass from a point below the axis of u corresponding 
to u a to a point above the axis of u corresponding to u a the curve 
remaining continuous and having its concavity or convexity always turned in 
the same direction a little attention will show that under these circumstances 
it must cut the axis of u once and only once 

hence between the limits u a u a there exists one value of u and only 
one which satisfies the equation it will further appear if in thought the 
curve be traced that the other value of u will be less than a when the quantity 
 — a — b is positive and greater than any one of the quantities a c when 
 — a — b is negative it hence follows that in the solution of the positive 
sign of the radical must be taken we thus find 


ab — ab — a — bc jq 

 a b 


 


where q ab ab a bc a bab abc 

 the results of this investigation may to some extent be verified thus 
it is evident that the probability of the event e must in general exceed the 
probability of the concurrence of the event e and the cause a or a hence 
we must have as the solution indicates 


u cpi u cp • 

again it is clear that the probability of the effect e must in general be less 
than it would be if the causes a l a were mutually exclusive hence 

u cp cp • 

lastly since the probability of the failure of the effect e concurring with the 
presence of the cause a must in general be less than the absolute probability 
of the failure of e we have 

cil pi u 

u c pi 


similarly 

u c l p • 

and thus the conditions by which the general solution was limited are con 
firmed 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


again let pi p this is to suppose that when either of the causes 
ai a is present the event e will occur we have then a ci b c a 
b d ci c and substituting in we get 


cic ci c c l c ci c l cic ci c 

u 

 ci c — cic on reduction 
 cil c 

now this is the known expression for the probability that one cause at least will 
be present which under the circumstances is evidently the probability of the 
event e 

finally let it be supposed that ci and c are very small so that their product 
may be neglected then the expression for u reduces to cipi c p now the 
smaller the probability of each cause the smaller in a much higher degree is 
the probability of a conjunction of causes ultimately therefore such reduction 
continuing the probability of the event e becomes the same as if the causes 
were mutually exclusive 

i have dwelt at greater length upon this solution because it serves in some 
respect as a model for those which follow some of which being of a more 
complex character might without such preparation appear difficult 

 problem ii — in place of the supposition adopted in the previous prob 
lem that the event e cannot happen when both the causes a a are absent 
let it be assumed that the causes a± a cannot both be absent and let the 
other circumstances remain as before required then the probability of the 
event e 

here in place of the equation of the previous solution we have the 
equation

the developed logical expression of is found to be 

 
z stxy stxy stxy stxy 

 
 stxy stxy stxy stxy 

 

 stxy stxy stxy stxy

and the final solution is

the quantity u being determined by the solution of the equation

u — a — b ’ 


a b — u

wherein a cipi b c p a — cil — pi b — c l — p 

the conditions of limitation are the following — that value of u must be 
chosen which exceeds each of the three quantities 

a b and a b — 

and which at the same time falls short of each of the three quantities 

a b and a b 

exactly as in the solution of the previous problem it may be shown that the 
quadratic equation will have one root and only one root satisfying these 
conditions the conditions themselves were deduced by the same rule as before 
excepting that the minor limit a b — was found by seeking the major limit 
oil — z 

it may be added that the constants in the data beside satisfying the condi 
tions implied above viz that the quantities a b and a b must individually 
exceed a b and a b — must also satisfy the condition c c this 
also appears from the application of the rule 

 problem iii — the probabilities of two events a and b are a and b 
respectively the probability that if the event a take place an event e will 
accompany it is p and the probability that if the event b take place the same 
event e will accompany it is q required the probability that if the event a 
take place the event b will take place or vice versa the probability that if b 
take place a will take place 

let us represent the event a by x the event b by y and the event e by z

substitute also for to in c their values in and we have

now the first equation of the system gives 


v p — p — ap — bq 


 v — ap bq 


similarly 


al pl q 


 p — a — p q 


adding these equations together and observing that the first member of the 
result becomes identical with the expression just found for prob xy we have 

prob xyis p a b— 

let us represent prob xy by u and let a — to then 


p v u — to

again from we have 

 w abpq — op bq — lp 

similarly from the first and third members of equated we have 

pv ab — pl — q — al — p — q — lv 

let us represent apbq— by h and ol — p — q — by h we find on 
equating the above values of iiq

let abp q — l then

now from and we get

substitute these values in reduced to the form

and we have 

hu — lh u — to abpqm 

a quadratic equation the solution of which determines u the value of prob xy 
sought 

the solution may readily be put in the form 

ih hhm — l i ylh — hhm — l ahh abpqm

but if we further observe that 

lb — hhm — l lh h — hhm l — hhm 


since 

whence 

we find 


h ap bq — h al — p — q — 
h h a b — m 


prob xy

 hh 


 


it remains to determine which sign must be given to the radical we might 
ascertain this by the general method exemplified in the last problem but it is 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


far easier and it fully suffices in the present instance to determine the sign 
by a comparison of the above formula with the result proper to some known 
case for instance if it were certain that the event a is always and the event 
b never associated with the event e then it is certain that the events a and 
b are never conjoined hence if p q we ought to have u now the 
assumptions p q give 

h a — h b— n ab — 


substituting in we have 


prob xy 


a — b — la b — ± a b — a — b — 

a — — 


and this expression vanishes when the lower sign is taken hence the final 
solution of the general problem will be expressed in the form 


prob xy ih hhm — l — — hh ahh abpq 

prob x ahh 


wherein h ap bq — h al — p — q — 


l abp q — m a b — 

as the terms in the final logical solution affected by the coefficient are the 
same as in the first problem of this chapter the conditions among the constants 
will be the same viz 


ap — — q bql — al—p 


 it is a confirmation of the correctness of the above solution that the expression 
obtained is symmetrical with respect to the two sets of quantities p q and —p 
 — q ie that on changing p into — p and q into — q the expression is 
unaltered this is apparent from the equation 


prob xy ab

employed in deducing the final result now if there exist probabilities p q of the 
event e as consequent upon a knowledge of the occurrences of a and b there 
exist probabilities — p — q of the contrary event that is of the nonoccurrence 
of e under the same circumstances as then the data are unchanged in form 
whether we take account in them of the occurrence or of the nonoccurrence of 
e it is evident that the solution ought to be as it is a symmetrical function of 
p q and — p — q 

the numerator was originally “a — — la — ” and was fixed in by 
distributed proofreaders 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


let us examine the particular case in which p q we find 
h a b — l h — l ab m a b— 
and substituting 

prob xy — ab a b — — a — — a — a b — a — a — b 
prob a — aa b — 

— aba — 

— aa — 

it would appear then that in this case the events a and b are virtually in 
dependent of each other the supposition of their invariable association with 
some other event e of the frequency of whose occurrence except as it may be 
inferred from this particular connexion absolutely nothing is known does not 
establish any dependence between the events a and b themselves i apprehend 
that this conclusion is agreeable to reason though particular examples may ap 
pear at first sight to indicate a different result for instance if the probabilities 
of the casting up st of a particular species of weed ndly of a certain de 
scription of zoophytes upon the seashore had been separately determined and 
if it had also been ascertained that neither of these events could happen except 
during the agitation of the waves caused by a tempest it would i think justly 
be concluded that the events in question were not independent the picking up 
of a piece of seaweed of the kind supposed would it is presumed render more 
probable the discovery of the zoophytes than it would otherwise have been but 
i apprehend that this fact is due to our knowledge of another circumstance not 
implied in the actual conditions of the problem viz that the occurrence of 
a tempest is but an occasional phenomenon let the range of observation be 
confined to a sea always vexed with storm it would then i suppose be seen 
that the casting up of the weeds and of the zoophytes ought to be regarded as 
independent events now to speak more generally there are conditions com 
mon to all phaenomena — conditions which it is felt do not affect their mutual 
independence i apprehend therefore that the solution indicates that when a 
particular condition has prevailed through the whole of our recorded experience 
it assumes the above character with reference to the class of phaenomena over 
which that experience has extended 

 problem iv — to illustrate in some degree the above observations let 
there be given in addition to the data of the last problem the absolute proba 
bility of the event e the completed system of data being 

prob x a prob y prob z c 

prob xz ap prob yz bq 

and let it be required to find prob xy

assuming as before xz s yz t xy w the final logical equation is

 terms whose coefficients are 


 

o 


the algebraic system having been formed the subsequent eliminations may be 
simplified by the transformations adopted in the previous problem the final 
result is 


prob xy ab

the conditions among the constants are 


cap cbq cl — al — p cl — — q 


now if p q we find 

ab 

prob xy — 
c 

c not admitting of any value less than a or b it follows hence that if the event 
e is known to be an occasional one its invariable attendance on the events x 
and y increases the probability of their conjunction in the inverse ratio of its 
own frequency the formula may be verified in a large number of cases as 
a particular instance let q c we find 


prob xy ab 

now the assumption q c involves by definition chap xvi the indepen 
dence of the events b and e if then b and e are independent no relation 
which may exist between a and e can establish a relation between a and b 
wherefore a and b are also independent as the above equation implies 

it may readily be shown from that the value of prob z which renders 
prob xy a minimum is 

prob

if p g this gives 

prob z p 

a result the correctness of which may be shown by the same considerations 
which have been applied to 

problem v — given the probabilities of any three events and the proba 
bility of their conjunction required the probability of the conjunction of any 
two of them 

suppose the data to be 


prob x p prob y q prob z r prob xyz m 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


and the qusesitum to be prob xy 

assuming xyz s xy i we find as the final logical equation 

t xyzs xyzs xys xs sum of all other constituents 

whence finally 

 h — wh — apqf — apqrm 

prob xy — 


wherein 

p — p c h pq p qr 

this admits of verification when p when q when r and therefore 
to c 

had the condition prob z r been omitted the solution would still have 
been definite we should have had

and it may be added as a final confirmation of their correctness that the above 
results become identical when to pqr 

 the following problem is a generalization of problem i and its solution 
though necessarily more complex is obtained by a similar analysis 

problem vi — if an event can only happen as a consequence of one or more 
of certain causes ai a ¦ a n and if generally cj represent the probability of 
the cause a and p the probability that if the cause a exist the event e will 
occur then the series of values of cj and pi being given required the probability 
of the event ea 

let the causes a a ¦ ¦ ¦ a n be represented by x±x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n and the event 
e by z 

then we have generally 


prob xi cj prob x cipi 

 it may be proper to remark that the above problem was proposed to the notice of math 
ematicians by the author in the cambridge and dublin mathematical journal nov 
accompanied by the subjoined observations 

“the motives which have led me after much consideration to adopt with reference to this 
question a course unusual in the present day and not upon slight grounds to be revived are 
the following — first i propose the question as a test of the sufficiency of received methods 
secondly anticipate that its discussion will in some measure add to our knowledge of an 
important branch of pure analysis however it is upon the former of these grounds alone that 
 desire to rest my apology 

“while hoping that some may be found who without departing from the line of their 
previous studies may deem this question worthy of their attention wholly disclaim the 
notion of its being offered as a trial of personal skill or knowledge but desire that it may be 
viewed solely with reference to those public and scientific ends for the sake of which alone it 
is proposed” 

the author thinks it right to add that the publication of the above problem led to some 
interesting private correspondence but did not elicit a solution 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


further the condition that e can only happen in connexion with some one or 
more of the causes a a a n establishes the logical condition 

zl xil x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

now let us assume generally 


xiz — t i 


which is reducible to the form 


xizl u ti xiz 

forming the type of a system of n equations which together with express 
the logical conditions of the problem adding all these equations together as 
after the previous reduction we are permitted to do we have 

x i z l ti xiz z aql x x n

and sufficient logical equation together with the n data represented by the 
general equations 

prob xi ci prob l cipi 

constitute the elements from which we are to determine prob 

let be developed with respect to z we have 

yml u ti xi xil x x n j 

 u — z — 

whence 

 

yjti ti ti xi aril x x n 

now any constituent in the expansion of the second member of the above equa 
tion will consist of n factors of which n are taken out of the set x x x n — 
xi — x — x n and n out of the set t t t n — t — t — t n 
no such combination as aql — ai ti — being admissible let us consider 
first those constituents of which — ti — t — t n forms the tfactor 
that is the factor derived from the set t — t 

the coefficient of any such constituent will be found by changing t t t n 
respectively into in the second member of and then assigning to x x x n 
their values as dependent upon the nature of the afactor of the constituent 
now simply substituting for tt t n the value the second member be 
comes 

 

 ®il x x n ’ 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


and this vanishes whatever values we subsequently assign to xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 
for if those values are not all equal to the term xi does not vanish and 
if they are all equal to the term — — x ± — x n becomes — so that 
in either case the denominator does not vanish and therefore the fraction does 
hence the coefficients of all constituents of which — t — t n is a factor 
will be and as the sum of all possible constituents is unity there will be an 
aggregate term — ti — t n in the development of z 

consider in the next place any constituent of which the ffactor is t t • • • t r 
t r — t„ r being equal to or greater than unity making in the second 
member of t t r t r i t n we get the expression 

r 

x x r — x r x n xil x ¦ • • xn 

now the only admissible values of the symbols being and it is evident 
that the above expression will be equal to when xi x r lvi 
 x n and that for all other combinations of value that expression will 
assume a value greater than unity hence the coefficient will be applied to all 
constituents of the final development which are of the form 

x x r l x r x n ti t r t r i t n 

the xfactor being similar to the tfactor while other constituents included under 
the present case will have the virtual coefficient also it is manifest that this 
reasoning is independent of the particular arrangement and succession of the 
individual symbols 

hence the complete expansion of z will be of the form 


 zar h t n 


 constituents whose coefficients are

where t represents any tconstituent except — t — t n and x the 
corresponding or similar constituent of x x n for instance if n we shall 
have

 constituents whose coefficients are

this result agrees difference of notation being allowed for with the developed 
form of in problem i of this chapter as it evidently ought to do 

 to avoid complexity i purpose to deduce from the above equation 
the necessary conditions for the determination of prob for the particular case

if we make for simplicity

the above equations may be written as follows

p oi x

wherein 


p u 


i u b ra xx 
 — xx ra 


 


this value of p substituted in will give an equation involving only u the 
solution of which will determine prob z since by prob z u it remains 
to assign the limits of u 

 now the very same analysis by which the limits were determined in the 
particular case in which n xix conducts us in the present case to 
the following result the quantity xx in order that it may represent the value 
of prob z must must have for its inferior limits the quantities oia a n 
and for its superior limits the quantities bi b b n aq a a n we may 
hence infer a priori that there will always exist one root and only one root of 
the equation satisfying these conditions i deem it sufficient for practical 
verification to show that there will exist one and only one root of the equation 
 between the limits aia ¦ a n and bi b ¦ b n 

first let us consider the nature of the changes to which p is subject in 
as xx varies from ai which we will suppose the greatest of its minor limits to b 
which we will suppose the least of its major limits when xx ai it is evident 
that p is positive and greater than a when u ip we have p b which 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


is also positive between the limits u a± u b it may be shown that p 
increases with u thus we have 


dp b u b n u bi ub u b n u 
du — u n — u n 

 b ub ub n u 

 n l 

 — u n 


 


now let 


bi — u b n — u 

 x 

 — u — u 


evidently xix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n will be proper fractions and we have 


— x x x n xx x n 
du 


— x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n i n lx x x n 


 xx x x n xl x x x n 


xx x n xx x n 


now the negative terms in the second member are if we may borrow the 
language of the logical developments constituents formed from the fractional 

quantities x x x n their sum cannot therefore exceed unity whence — 

du 

is positive and i increases with u between the limits specified 

now let be written in the form 


m cq • • • m a n 




n— 


 m u 


and assume u a the first member becomes 


ma i 


i a fj a„ 




n— 


 



 


 


and this expression is negative in value for making the same assumption in 
 we find 


i u b n u 

u — a i — a positive quantity 

 — u n l 


at the same time we have 

h ¦ • ¦ ft a n m h a n 

h n l ij fi 

and since the factors of the second member are positive fractions that member 
is less than unity whence is negative wherefore the assumption u a 
makes the first member of negative 

secondly let u b then by z u and the first member of 
becomes positive 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


lastly between the limits u a and u b the first member of 
continuously increases for the first term of that expression written under the 
form 

xa i pa n 

m a i 

p p 

increases since p increases and with it every factor contained again the 
negative term j — u diminishes with the increase of u as appears from its value 
deduced from viz 

bi u b n u 

 u n l 

hence then between the limits u a± u b the first member of con 
tinuously increases changing in so doing from a negative to a positive value 
wherefore between the limits assigned there exists one value of u and only 
one by which the said equation is satisfied 

 collecting these results together we arrive at the following solution of 
the general problem 

the probability of the event e will be that value of u deduced from the 
equation 

x cipi n c n p n 

pu 


wherein 


lcilpi c n l p n u 

a u r — 

 — u n 


which value lies between the two sets of quantities 

cipic p • • • c n p„ and cil pil c l p c n l p n 


the former set being its inferior the latter its superior limits 

and it may further be inferred in the general case as it has been proved in 
the particular case of n that the value of u determined as above will not 
exceed the quantity 

cipi c p ¦¦¦ c n p n 

 particular verifications are subjoined 

st let pi p p n this is to suppose it certain that if any 
one of the events aia a n happen the event e will happen in this case 
then the probability of the occurrence of e will simply be the probability that 
the events or causes aia a n do not all fail of occurring and its expression 
will therefore be — — cil — c — c n 

now the general solution gives 


wherein 




chapter xx problems on causes 


 


hence 


 u ci c„ 
u cl c„ 

equivalent to the a priori determination above 

nd let p± p p n then gives 

p — u p 

 u 


as it evidently ought to be 

rd let c ¦ ¦ ¦ c n be small quantities so that their squares and products 

may be neglected then developing the second members of the equation 


p n cipi c p ¦¦¦ c n p n p n 

pu — 

p n 

 p cipi cp ¦¦¦ c n p n 


 u cp cp ¦¦¦ c n p„ 


now this is what the solution would be were the causes a a a n mu 
tually exclusive but the smaller the probabilities of those causes the more do 
they approach the condition of being mutually exclusive since the smaller is the 
probability of any concurrence among them hence the result above obtained 
will undoubtedly be the limiting form of the expression for the probability of e 

th in the particular case of n we may readily eliminate p from the 
general solution the result is 

m cipiu cp ci pi zt c l p u 

cp cp —u — u 

which agrees with the particular solution before obtained for this case problem 

i 

though by the system the solution is in general made to depend upon 
the solution of an equation of a high order its practical difficulty will not be 
great for the conditions relating to the limits enable us to select at once a near 
value of it and the forms of the system are suitable for the processes of 
successive approximation 

 problem the data being the same as in the last problem re 
quired the probability that if any definite and given combination of the causes 
ai a a n present itself the event e will be realized 

the cases ai a a n being represented as before by x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n respec 
tively let the definite combination of them referred to in the statement of the 
problem be represented by the cjx £ • • • x n so that the actual occurrence of 
that combination will be expressed by the logical equation 


 x x x n l 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


the data are 


prob x ci prob x n c n 
prob xz cipi prob x n z c n p n 


and the object of investigation is 

prob fx i £ ¦ • ¦ x n z 
prob pxi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 


we shall first seek the value of the numerator 
let us assume 


 

 


xiz ti x n z t n 

jx x x n z w 

or if for simplicity we represent pxix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n by fi the last equation will be 

z w 

to which must be added the equation 

xix ¦ ¦ x n z 

now any equation x r z t r of the system may be reduced to the form 

x r zt r t r — x r z 

similarly reducing and adding the different results together we obtain the 
logical equation 

yix r zt r t r l — x r z x x n z zw wl — cfz 

from which being eliminated w must be determined as a developed logical 
function of x ± x n 

now making successively z z in the above equation and multiplying 
the results together we have 

yix r t r x r t r x x n fui wp x s t r w 

developing this equation with reference to w and replacing in the result t r l 
by in accordance with prop chap ix we have

and hence

the second member of this equation we must now develop with respect to 
the double series of symbols x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n t t ¦ ¦ ¦ t n in effecting this object it 
will be most convenient to arrange the constituents of the resulting development 
in three distinct classes and to determine the coefficients proper to those classes 
separately 

first let us consider those constituents of which f t n is a factor making 
t t n we find 

e e yix r xi x n j 


it is evident that whatever values are given to the xsymbols e does not 
vanish hence the coefficients of all constituents involving t t n are 

consider secondly those constituents which do not involve the factor i t n 
and which are symmetrical with reference to the two sets of symbols x x n 
and t t n by symmetrical constituents is here meant those which would re 
main unchanged if x were converted into ti aq into t c and vice versa 
the constituents x x n ti t n x x n t t n c are in this sense sym 
metrical for all symmetrical constituents it is evident that 

xyty — i txf 


vanishes for those which do not involve t t n it is further evident that 
x x n also vanishes whence 


e j 
w 


e tt r f 
etr 

e a e 


for those constituents of which the xfactor is found in j the second member 
of the above equation becomes for those of which the xfactor is found in 
it becomes hence the coefficients of symmetrical constituents not involving 
t t n of which the xfactor is found in f will he of those of which the 
xfactor is not found in f it will be 

consider lastly those constituents which are unsymmetrical with reference 
to the two sets of symbols and which at the same time do not involve t t n 

here it is evident that neither e nor e can vanish whence the numerator 
of the fractional value of w in must exceed the denominator that value 
cannot therefore be represented by or it must then in the logical 
development be represented by j such then will be the coefficient of this class 
of constituents 

 hence the final logical equation by which w is expressed as a developed 
logical function of xi x n ti t n will be of the form 

w i xt ° at ti t n sum of other con 

stituents 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


wherein jt represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of which the 
factor x is found in and t at the sum of all symmetrical constituents of 
which the factor x is not found in — the constituent x x n t t n should 
it appear being in either case rejected 

passing from logic to algebra it may be observed that here and in all 
similar instances the function v by the aid of which the algebraic system of 
equations for the determination of the values of xi x n t t n is formed is 
independent of the nature of any function f involved not in the expression of 
the data but in that of the qucesitum of the problem proposed thus we have 
in the present example

here xt represents the sum of all symmetrical constituents of the x and t 
symbols except the constituent x x n t i n this value of v is the same 
as that virtually employed in the solution of the preceding problem and hence 
we may avail ourselves of the results there obtained 

if then as in the solution referred to we assume 

xiti ran n

we shall obtain a result which may be thus written

m being formed by rejecting from the function f the constituent xi x n if 
it is there found dividing the result by the same constituent xi x n and then 
changing u into mi into m and so on the values of m and n are the 
same as in the preceding problem reverting to these and to the corresponding 
values of m m c we find

the above value of prob w will be the numerator of the fraction it now 
remains to determine its denominator 

for this purpose assume

substituting the first member of this equation in in place of the corre

a very slight attention to the mode of formation of the functions mi and jvi 
will show that the process may be greatly simplified we may indeed exhibit 
the solution of the general problem in the form of a rule as follows 

reject from the function jxi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n the constituent xix„ if it is 
therein contained suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors x x 
c and change generally in the result x r into ¦ call this result mi 

again replace in the function jx ix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n the constituent xi x n if is 
therein found by unity suppress in all the remaining constituents the factors 
xi x c and change generally in the result x r into ° r i n t ¦

p and v being determined by the solution of the system of equations

v nl 

it may be added that the limits of p and v are the same as in the previous 
problem this might be inferred from the general principle of continuity but 
conditions of limitation which are probably sufficient may also be established 
by other considerations 

thus from the demonstration of the general method in probabilities chap 
xvii prop iv it appears that the quantities x x n ti t n in the primary 
system of algebraic equations must be positive proper fractions now 

x r c r — p r 

 — x r r v — c r l — p r 

hence generally n r must be a positive quantity and therefore we must have 


v c r l — p r 


in like manner since we have 


xqctf 

 avl tr

c r p r 

fji cppf 


we must have generally 


p c r pr ¦ 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


 it is probable that the two classes of conditions thus represented are 
together sufficient to determine generally which of the roots of the equations 
determining p and is are to be taken let us take in particular the case in which 
n here we have 


mcipixc p x cpcp 

p is y p dpi cp

 v c p c p h dpi 

p p 


whence since p dpi we have generally 


is — cp 


in like manner we have

now it has already been shown that there will exist but one value of p 
satisfying the whole of the above conditions relative to that quantity viz 


p c r p r p — c r l —p r 


whence the solution for this case at least is determinate and i apprehend that 
the same method is generally applicable and sufficient but this is a question 
upon which a further degree of light is desirable 

to verify the above results suppose fxi x n which is virtually the 
case considered in the previous problem now the development of gives all

let it be observed that this case is quite different from the wellknown one 
in which the mutually exclusive character of the causes a a n is one of the 
elements of the data expressing a condition under which the very observations 
by which the probabilities of ai a c are supposed to have been determined 
were made

this expression assumes as it ought to do the value when any one of the 
quantities pi p n is equal to 

 problem viii — certain causes a a a n being so restricted that 
they cannot all fail but still can only occur in certain definite combinations 
denoted by the equation

chapter xx problems on causes 


 


and there being given the separate probabilities c c„ of the said causes and 
the corresponding probabilities p p n that an event e will follow if those 
respective causes are realized required the probability of the event e 

this problem differs from the one last considered in several particulars but 
chiefly in this that the restriction denoted by the equation ai a n 
forms one of the data and is supposed to be furnished by or to be accordant 
with the very experience from which the knowledge of the numerical elements 
of the problem is derived 

representing the events a a n by xi x„ respectively and the event 
e by z we have — 

prob x r — c r prob x r z c r p r 

let us assume generally 

xfz — tf 

then combining the system of equations thus indicated with the equations 
x x n jx ix n or 

furnished in the data we ultimately find as the developed expression of z 

z eit oii i t„ei 


where x represents in succession each constituent found in f and t a similar se 
ries of constituents of the symbols fi t n xt including only symmetrical 
constituents with reference to the two sets of symbols 

the method of reduction to be employed in the present case is so similar to 
the one already exemplified in former problems that i shall merely exhibit the 
results to which it leads we find

with the relations

wherein m is formed by suppressing in cfx x n all the factors xi x n 
and changing in the result x into m x n into m n while n is formed by 
substituting in m ri for mi c moreover mi consists of that portion of m 
of which mi is a factor ivi of that portion of n of which ni is a factor and so 
on 

let us take in illustration the particular case in which the causes ai a n 
are mutually exclusive here we have

a known result 

there are other particular cases in which the system admits of ready 
solution it is however obvious that in most instances it would lead to results 
of great complexity nor does it seem probable that the existence of a functional 
relation among causes such as is assumed in the data of the general problem 
will often be presented in actual experience if we except only the particular 
cases above discussed 

had the general problem been modified by the restriction that the event e 
cannot occur all the causes ai a n being absent instead of the restriction 
that the said causes cannot all fail the remaining condition denoted by the 
equation pai a n being retained we should have found for the final 
logical equation 

 t o£po 

 

x being as before equal to p x x n but ixt formed by rejecting 
from f the particular constituent xi x n if therein contained and then multi 
plying each xconstituent of the result by the corresponding iconstituent it is 
obvious that in the particular case in which the causes are mutually exclusive 
the value of prob z hence deduced will be the same as before 

 problem ix — assuming the data of any of the previous problems let 
it be required to determine the probability that if the event e present itself it 
will be associated with the particular cause a r in other words to determine the 
a posteriori probability of the cause a r when the event e has been observed to 
occur 

in this case we must seek the value of the fraction 


prob x r z 


ctpy 

prob z ’ 


prob z 


by the data 


 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


as in the previous problems the value of prob z has been assigned upon dif 
ferent hypotheses relative to the connexion or want of connexion of the causes 
it is evident that in all those cases the present problem is susceptible of a de 
terminate solution by simply substituting in the value of that element thus 
determined 

if the a priori probabilities of the causes are equal we have ci c c r 
hence for the different causes the value will vary directly as the quantity 
p r wherefore whatever the nature of the connexion among the causes the a 
posteriori probability of each cause will be proportional to the probability of 
the observed event e when that cause is known to exist the particular case 
of this theorem which presents itself when the causes are mutually exclusive is 
well known we have then 

prob x r z c r p r p r 

prob z j c rpr pi p ¦ ¦ ¦ pn ’ 

the values of ci c n being equal 

although for the demonstration of these and similar theorems in the par 
ticular case in which the causes are mutually exclusive it is not necessary to 
introduce the functional symbol j which is indeed to claim for ourselves the 
choice of all possible and conceivable hypotheses of the connexion of the causes 
yet under every form the solution by the method of this work of problems 
in which the number of the data is indefinitely great must always partake of 
a somewhat complex character whether the systematic evolution which it 
presents first of the logical secondly of the numerical relations of a prob 
lem furnishes any compensation for the length and occasional tediousness of its 
processes i do not presume to inquire its chief value undoubtedly consists in its 
power — in the mastery which it gives us over questions which would apparently 
baffle the unassisted strength of human reason for this cause it has not been 
deemed superfluous to exhibit in this chapter its application to problems some 
of which may possibly be regarded as repulsive from their difficulty without 
being recommended by any prospect of immediate utility of the ulterior value 
of such speculations it is i conceive impossible for us at present to form any 
decided judgment 

 the following problem is of a much easier description than the previous 
ones 

problem x — the probability of the occurrence of a certain natural phenom 
enon under given circumstances is p observation has also recorded a probability 
a of the existence of a permanent cause of that phenomenon ie of a cause 
which would always produce the event under the circumstances supposed what 
is the probability that if the phenomenon is observed to occur n times in succes 
sion under the given circumstances it will occur the n th time what also is 
the probability after such observation of the existence of the permanent cause 
referred to 

first case — let t represent the existence of a permanent cause and 
xix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n the successive occurrences of the natural phaenomenon

if the permanent cause exist the events xix x n i are necessary conse 
quences hence 

t vx i t vx c 
and eliminating the indefinite symbols 

tl — xi t lx fl x n 

now we are to seek the probability that if the combination xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x n happen 
the event x n i will happen ie we are to seek the value of the fraction 

prob xix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

prob x n 

we will first seek the value of prob £ • • • x n represent the combination 
x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n by w then we have the following logical equations 

tl — q t — tl — x n 

x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n w 

reducing the last to the form 

 • • • „ — w ul — xix ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

and adding it to the former ones we have 

t — xi x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n l w tul — xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

wherein extends to all values of i from to n for the one logical equation of 
the data with this we must connect the numerical conditions 

prob xi prob x ¦ ¦ ¦ prob x n p prob t a 

and our object is to find prob w 

from we have

 x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n —

on developing with respect to t this result must further be developed with 
respect to x± • • • x n 

now if we make q x • • • x n the coefficients both of t and of 
 — t become if we give to the same symbols any other set of values formed 
by the interchange of and it is evident that the coefficient of t will become 
negative while that of — t will become hence the full development will 
be

from the forms of the above equations it is evident that we have x

from which we readily deduce

as the expression of the probability that if the phaenomenon be n times repeated 
it will also present itself the n th time by the method of chapter xix it is 
found that a cannot exceed p in value 

the following verifications are obvious — 

st if a the expression reduces to p as it ought to do for when 
it is certain that no permanent cause exists the successive occurrences of the 
phaenomenon are independent 

nd if p the expression becomes as it ought to do 

rd if p a the expression becomes unless a if the probability 
of a phaenomenon is equal to the probability that there exists a cause which

under given circumstances would always produce it then the fact that that 
phaenomenon has ever been noticed under those circumstances renders certain 
its reappearance under the same 

th as n increases the expression approaches in value to unity this 
indicates that the probability of the recurrence of the event increases with the 
frequency of its successive appearances — a result agreeable to the natural laws 
of expectation 

second case — we are now to seek the probability a posteriori of the 
existence of a permanent cause of the phaenomenon this requires that we 
ascertain the value of the fraction 

prob tx x x n 
prob xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

the denominator of which has already been determined 

to determine the numerator assume 

tx x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n w 

then proceeding as before we obtain for the logical development 


w tx x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n — t 


whence passing from logic to algebra we have at once 


prob w a 

a result which might have been anticipated substituting then for the numerator 
and denominator of the above fraction their values we have for the a posteriori 
probability of a permanent cause the expression 

“ f o yt 

it is obvious that the value of this expression increases with the value of n 

i am indebted to a learned correspondent whose original contributions 
to the theory of probabilities have already been referred to for the following 
verification of the first of the above results 

 as we can neither reenter nor recall the state of infancy we are unable to say how far 
such results as the above serve to explain the confidence with which young children connect 
events whose association they have once perceived but we may conjecture generally that 
the strength of their expectations is due to the necessity of inferring as a part of their rational 
nature and the narrow but impressive experience upon which the faculty is exercised hence 
the reference of every kind of sequence to that of cause and effect a little friend of the 
author’s on being put to bed was heard to ask his brother the pertinent question — ’’why 
does going to sleep at night make it light in the morning” the brother who was a year older 
was able to reply that it would be light in the morning even if little boys did not go to sleep 
at night

“the whole a priori probability of the event under the circumstances being 
p and the probability of some cause c which would necessarily produce it a 
let x be the probability that it will happen if no such cause as c exist then 
we have the equation 

p a — ax 

whence 

p — a 


now the phaenomenon observed is the occurrence of the event n times the a 
priori probability of this would be — 


 supposing c to exist 
x n supposing c not to exist 


whence the a posteriori probability that c exists is 

a 

a — ax n ’ 


that c does not exist is

a — ax n 

consequently the probability of another occurrence is

similar verifications might it is probable also be found for the following

 it is remarkable that the solutions of the previous problems are void of 
any arbitrary element we should scarcely from the appearance of the data 
have anticipated such a circumstance it is however to be observed that 
in all those problems the probabilities of the causes involved are supposed to 
be known a priori in the absence of this assumed element of knowledge it 
seems probable that arbitrary constants would necessarily appear in the final 
solution some confirmation of this remark is afforded by a class of problems to 
which considerable attention has been directed and which in conclusion i shall 
briefly consider it has been observed that there exists in the heavens a large 
number of double stars of extreme closeness either these apparent instances 
of connexion have some physical ground or they have not if they have not 
we may regard the phenomenon of a double star as the accidental result of 
a “random distribution” of stars over the celestial vault ie of a distribution 
which would render it just as probable that either member of the binary system 
should appear in one spot as in another if this hypothesis be assumed and if 
the number of stars of a requisite brightness be known we can determine what 
is the probability that two of them should be found within such limits of mutual 
distance as to constitute the observed phenomenon thus mitchell estimating 
that there are stars in the heavens equal in brightness to capricorni 
determines that it is to against such a combination being presented were 
those stars distributed at random the probability when such a combination 
has been observed that there exists between its members a physical ground of 
connexion is then required 

again the sum of the inclinations of the orbits of the ten known planets 
to the plane of the ecliptic in the year was ° according to the 
french measures were all inclinations equally probable laplace determines 
that there would be only the excessively small probability that 
the mean of the inclinations should fall within the limit thus assigned and he 
hence concludes that there is a very high probability in favour of a disposing 
cause by which the inclinations of the planetary orbits have been confined 
within such narrow bounds professor de morgan taking the sum of the 
inclinations at ° gives to the above probability the value and infers 
that “it is that there was a necessary cause in the formation of the 
solar system for the inclinations being what they are” an equally determinate

conclusion has been drawn from observed coincidences between the direction 
of circular polarization in rockcrystal and that of certain oblique faces in its 
crystalline structure 

these problems are all of a similar character a certain hypothesis is 
framed of the various possible consequences of which we are able to assign 
the probabilities with perfect rigour now some actual result of observation 
being found among those consequences and its hypothetical probability being 
therefore known it is required thence to determine the probability of the hy 
pothesis assumed or its contrary in mitchell’s problem the hypothesis is that 
of a “random distribution of the stars” — the possible and observed consequence 
the appearance of a close double star the very small probability of such a re 
sult is held to imply that the probability of the hypothesis is equally small or 
at least of the same order of smallness and hence the high and and as some 
think determinate probability of a disposing cause in the stellar arrangements 
is inferred similar remarks apply to the other examples adduced 

 the general problem in whatsoever form it may be presented admits 
only of an indefinite solution let x represent the proposed hypothesis y a 
phaenomenon which might occur as one of its possible consequences and whose 
calculated probability on the assumption of the truth of the hypothesis is p 
and let it be required to determine the probability that if the phaenomenon y 
is observed the hypothesis x is true the very data of this problem cannot be 
expressed without the introduction of an arbitrary element we can only write 

prob x — a prob xy ap 


a being perfectly arbitrary except that it must fall within the limits and 
inclusive if then p represent the conditional probability sought we have 

„ prob xy ap 

p — 

prob y prob y 

it remains then to determine prob y let xy t then 

y tx t — x — tx — tl — x 

£ 


hence observing that prob x a prob t ap and passing from logic to 
algebra we have 


prob y 


tx c — tx 
txl — t 


with the relations 


tx — t x tx 

 — tx — t 

a ap 


hence we readily find 


prob y ap cl — a 

 edinburgh review no p this article though not entirely free from error is 
well worthy of attention 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


now recurring to we find that c is the probability that if the event 
 — tl — x occur the event y will occur but 

 — tl — x — xy — x — x 

hence c is the probability that if the event x do not occur the event y will 
occur 

substituting the value of prob y in we have the following theorem 

the calculated probability of any phenomenon y upon an assumed physical 
hypothesis x being p the a posteriori probability p of the physical hypothesis 
when the phenomenon has been observed is expressed by the equation 

p ap 

ap cl — a ’ j 

where a and c are arbitrary constants the former representing the a priori proba 
bility of the hypothesis the latter the probability that if the hypothesis were false 
the event y would present itself 

the principal conclusion deducible from the above theorem is that other 
things being the same the value of p increases and diminishes simultaneously 
with that of p hence the greater or less the probability of the phaenomenon 
when the hypothesis is assumed the greater or less is the probability of the hy 
pothesis when the phenomenon has been observed when p is very small then 
generally p also is small unless either a is large or c small hence secondly 
if the probability of the phaenomenon is very small when the hypothesis is as 
sumed the probability of the hypothesis is very small when the phaenomenon 
is observed unless either the a priori probability a of the hypothesis is large 
or the probability of the phaenomenon upon any other hypothesis small 

the formula admits of exact verification in various cases as when c 
or a or a but it is evident that it does not unless there be means 
for determining the values of a and c yield a definite value of p any solu 
tions which profess to accomplish this object either are erroneous in principle 
or involve a tacit assumption respecting the above arbitrary elements mr 
de morgan’s solution of laplace’s problem concerning the existence of a deter 
mining cause of the narrow limits within which the inclinations of the planetary 
orbits to the plane of the ecliptic are confined appears to me to be of the lat 
ter description having found a probability p that the sum of 
the inclinations would be less than ° were all degrees of inclination equally 
probable in each orbit this able writer remarks “if there be a reason for the 
inclinations being as described the probability of the event is consequently 
it is ie p that there was a necessary cause in the formation 
of the solar system for the inclinations being what they are” now this result is 
what the equation would really give if assigning to p the above value we 
should assume c a for we should thus find 

r p 

p p 

 p p p 


 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


but p representing the probability a posteriori that all inclinations are 
equally probable — p is the probability a posteriori that such is not the case 
or adopting mr de morgan’s alternative that a determining cause exists the 
equation therefore agrees with mr de morgan’s result 

 are we however justified in assigning to a and c particular values i am 
strongly disposed to think that we are not the question is of less importance 
in the special instance than in its ulterior bearings in the received applications 
of the theory of probabilities arbitrary constants do not explicitly appear but 
in the above and in many other instances sanctioned by the highest authorities 
some virtual determination of them has been attempted and this circumstance 
has given to the results of the theory especially in reference to questions of 
causation a character of definite precision which while on the one hand it 
has seemed to exalt the dominion and extend the province of numbers even 
beyond the measure of their ancient claim to rule the world on the other 
hand has called forth vigorous protests against their intrusion into realms in 
which conjecture is the only basis of inference the very fact of the appearance 
of arbitrary constants in the solutions of problems like the above treated by the 
method of this work seems to imply that definite solution is impossible and 
to mark the point where inquiry ought to stop we possess indeed the means 
of interpreting those constants but the experience which is thus indicated is as 
much beyond our reach as the experience which would preclude the necessity of 
any attempt at solution whatever 

another difficulty attendant upon these questions and inherent perhaps 
in the very constitution of our faculties is that of precisely defining what is 
meant by order the manifestations of that principle except in very complex 
instances we have no difficulty in detecting nor do we hesitate to impute to it 
an almost necessary foundation in causes operating under law but to assign 
to it a standard of numerical value would be a vain not to say a presumptuous 
endeavour yet must the attempt be made before we can aspire to weigh with 
accuracy the probabilities of different constitutions of the universe so as 
to determine the elements upon which alone a definite solution of the problems 
in question can be established 

 the most usual mode of endeavouring to evade the necessary arbitrari 
ness of the solution of problems in the theory of probabilities which rest upon 
insufficient data is to assign to some element whose real probability is unknown 
all possible degrees of probability to suppose that these degrees of probability 
are themselves equally probable and regarding them as so many distinct causes 
of the phenomenon observed to apply the theorems which represent the case of 
an effect due to some one of a number of equally probable but mutually exclusive 
causes problem for instance the rising of the sun after a certain interval

sun’s rising after an interval of darkness lies between the limits p and p dp

and the probability that he will do this and will rise again or which is the

the known and generally received solution 

the above solution is usually founded upon a supposed analogy of the prob 
lem with that of the drawing of balls from an urn containing a mixture of black 
and white balls between which all possible numerical ratios are assumed to be 
equally probable and it is remarkable that there are two or three distinct 
hypotheses which lead to the same final result for instance if the balls are 
finite in number and those which arc drawn are not replaced or if they are 
infinite in number whether those drawn are replaced or not then supposing 
that to successive drawings have yielded only white balls the probability of the 
issue of a white ball at the m th drawing is 


to 

it has been said that the principle involved in the above and in similar ap 
plications is that of the equal distribution of our knowledge or rather of our 
ignorance — the assigning to different states of things of which we know nothing 
and upon the very ground that we know nothing equal degrees of probability 
i apprehend however that this is an arbitrary method of procedure instances 
may occur and one such has been adduced in which different hypotheses lead 
to the same final conclusion but those instances are exceptional with refer 
ence to the particular problem in question it is shown in the memoir cited that 
there is one hypothesis viz when the balls are finite in number and not re 
placed which leads to a different conclusion and it is easy to see that there are 
other hypotheses as strictly involving the principle of the “equal distribution 
of knowledge or ignorance” which would also conduct to conflicting results

 for instance let the case of sunrise be represented by the drawing of a 
white ball from a bag containing an infinite number of balls which are all either 
black or white and let the assumed principle be that all possible constitutions 
of the system of balls are equally probable by a constitution of the system i 
mean an arrangement which assigns to every ball in the system a determinate 
colour either black or white let us thence seek the probability that if m 
white balls are drawn in m drawings a white ball will be drawn in the m th 
drawing 

first suppose the number of the balls to be and let the symbols x x 

be appropriated to them in the following manner let x t denote that event which 
consists in the i th ball of the system being white the proposition declaratory of 
such a state of things being xi in like manner the compound symbol — xi 
will represent the circumstance of the i th ball being black it is evident that 
the several constituents formed of the entire set of symbols xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x will 
represent in like manner the several possible constitutions of the system of balls 
with respect to blackness and whiteness and the number of such constitutions 

being the probability of each will in accordance with the hypothesis be — 

 

this is the value which we should find if we substituted in the expression of any 
constituent for 

each of the symbols xx ¦ ¦ x the value hence then the probability 
of any event which can be expressed as a series of constituents of the above 
description will be found by substituting in such expression the value — for 
each of the above symbols 

now the larger p is the less probable it is that any ball which has been drawn 
and replaced will be drawn again as p approaches to infinity this probability 
approaches to and this being the case the state of the balls actually drawn 
can be expressed as a logical function of m of the symbols xx ¦ ¦ x and 
therefore by development as a series of constituents of the said m symbols 
hence therefore its probability will be found by substituting for each of the 

symbols whether in the undeveloped or the developed form the value — but 
this is the very substitution which it would be necessary and which it would 
suffice to make if the probability of a white ball at each drawing were known 

a priori to be 

it follows therefore that if the number of balls be infinite and all constitu 
tions of the system equally probable the probability of drawing in white balls 

in succession will be — and the probability of drawing m white balls in 
 

succession — 

 ’ 

whence the probability that after m white balls have been drawn the next 
drawing will furnish a white one will be — in other words past experience 

does not in this case affect future expectation 

 it may be satisfactory to verify this result by ordinary methods to 



chapter xx problems on causes 


 


accomplish this we shall seek 

first the probability of drawing r white balls and p — r black balls in p 
trials out of a bag containing p balls every ball being replaced after drawing 
and all constitutions of the systems being equally probable a priori 

secondly the value which this probability assumes when p becomes infinite 

thirdly the probability hence derived that if m white balls are drawn in 
succession the m th ball drawn will be white also 

the probability that r white balls and p — r black ones will be drawn in p 
trials out of an urn containing p balls each ball being replaced after trial and 
all constitutions of the system as above defined being equally probable is equal 
to the sum of the probabilities of the same result upon the separate hypotheses 
of there being no white balls white ball — lastly p white balls in the urn 
therefore it is the sum of the probabilities of this result on the hypothesis of 
there being n white balls n varying from to p 

now supposing that there are n white balls the probability of drawing a 
white ball in a single drawing is ” and the probability of drawing r white balls 
and p — r black ones in a particular order in p drawings is 



but there being as many such orders as there are combinations of r things in p 
things the total probability of drawing r white balls in p drawings out of the 
system of p balls of which n are white is 


 

again the number of constitutions of the system of p balls which admit of 
exactly n balls being white is 

pp p n

and the number of possible constitutions of the system is hence the proba 
bility that exactly n balls are white is

and generally any proposed result will have the same probability as if it were

 these results only illustrate the fact that when the defect of data is 
supplied by hypothesis the solutions will in general vary with the nature of 
the hypotheses assumed so that the question still remains only more definite 
in form whether the principles of the theory of probabilities serve to guide 
us in the election of such hypotheses i have already expressed my conviction 
that they do not — a conviction strengthened by other reasons than those above 
stated thus a definite solution of a problem having been found by the method 
of this work an equally definite solution is sometimes attainable by the same 
method when one of the data suppose prob x p is omitted but i have not 
been able to discover any mode of deducing the second solution from the first 
by integration with respect to p supposed variable within limits determined by

principle adverted to in art valid still it is with diffidence that i express 
my dissent on these points from mathematicians generally and more especially

from one who of english writers has most fully entered into the spirit and the 
methods of laplace and i venture to hope that a question second to none other 
in the theory of probabilities in importance will receive the careful attention 
which it deserves 



chapter xxi 

particular application of the previous 
general method to the question of the 
probability of judgments 


 on the presumption that the general method of this treatise for the solution 
of questions in the theory of probabilities has been sufficiently elucidated in 
the previous chapters it is proposed here to enter upon one of its practical 
applications selected out of the wide field of social statistics viz the estimation 
of the probability of judgments perhaps this application if weighed by its 
immediate results is not the best that could have been chosen one of the first 
conclusions to which it leads is that of the necessary insufficiency of any data 
that experience alone can furnish for the accomplishment of the most important 
object of the inquiry but in setting clearly before us the necessity of hypotheses 
as supplementary to the data of experience and in enabling us to deduce with 
rigour the consequences of any hypothesis which may be assumed the method 
accomplishes all that properly lies within its scope and it may be remarked 
that in questions which relate to the conduct of our own species hypotheses are 
more justifiable than in questions such as those referred to in the concluding 
sections of the previous chapter our general experience of human nature comes 
in aid of the scantiness and imperfection of statistical records 

 the elements involved in problems relating to criminal assize are the 
following — 

st the probability that a particular member of the jury will form a correct 
opinion upon the case 

nd the probability that the accused party is guilty 

rd the probability that he will be condemned or that he will be acquitted 

th the probability that his condemnation or acquittal will be just 

th the constitution of the jury 

th the data furnished by experience such as the relative numbers of cases 
in which unanimous decisions have been arrived at or particular majorities 
obtained the number of cases in which decisions have been reversed by superior 
courts c 

again the class of questions under consideration may be regarded as either 
direct or inverse the direct questions of probability are those in which the 


 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


probability of correct decision for each member of the tribunal or of guilt for the 
accused party are supposed to be known a priori and in which the probability 
of a decision of a particular kind or with a definite majority is sought inverse 
problems are those in which from the data furnished by experience it is required 
to determine some element which though it stand to those data in the relation of 
cause to effect cannot directly be made the subject of observation as when from 
the records of the decisions of courts it is required to determine the probability 
that a member of a court will judge correctly to this species of problems the 
most difficult and the most important of the whole series attention will chiefly 
be directed here 

 there is no difficulty in solving the direct problems referred to in the 
above enumeration suppose there is but one juryman let k be the probability 
that the accused person is guilty x the probability that the juryman will form a 
correct opinion x the probability that the accused person will be condemned 
then — 


kx probability that the accused party is guilty and that the 
juryman judges him to be guilty 

i — kl — x probability that the accused person is inno 
cent and that the juryman pronounces him guilty 

now these being the only cases in which a verdict of condemnation can be 
given and being moreover mutually exclusive we have 

x kx — fcl — x 

in like manner if there be n jurymen whose separate probabilities of correct 
judgment are xix x n the probability of an unanimous verdict of condem 
nation will be 


x kx ix x n l k aql x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

whence if the several probabilities x n are equal and are each repre 
sented by x we have 

x kx n lklx n 

the probability in the latter case that the accused person is guilty will be 

kx n 

kx n — fcl — x n 

all these results assume that the events whose probabilities are denoted by k 
xi c are independent an assumption which however so far as we are 
concerned is involved in the fact that those events are the only ones of which 
the probabilities are given 

the probability of condemnation by a given number of voices may be found 
on the same principles if a jury is composed of three persons whose several 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


probabilities of correct decision are x x x the probability x that the accused 
person will be declared guilty by two of them will be 

x kxx — x xxl — x xx — x 

 jfel xl xx xl xx xl xx 

which if x x x reduces to 

fcx l — x — kx — x 

and by the same mode of reasoning it will appear that if x i represent the 
probability that the accused person will be declared guilty by i voices out of a 
jury consisting of n persons whose separate probabilities of correct judgment 
are equal and represented by x then 

xi t kx x kx n l a 

if the probability of condemnation by a determinate majority a is required we 
have simply 

i — a n — i 

whence 

n a 


which must be substituted in the above formula of course a admits only of 
such values as make i an integer if n is even those values are c if 
odd c as is otherwise obvious 

the probability of a condemnation by a majority of at least a given number 
of voices m will be found by adding together the following several probabilities 
determined as above viz 

st the probability of a condemnation by an exact majority 
m 


nd the probability of condemnation by the next greater ma 
jority m 

and so on the last element of the series being the probability of unanimous 
condemnation thus the probability of condemnation by a majority of at 
least out of jurors would be 


a xg x 

the values of the above terms being given by after making therein n 

 when instead of a jury we are considering the case of a simple deliber 
ative assembly consisting of n persons whose separate probabilities of correct 
judgment are denoted by x the above formulae are replaced by others made 
somewhat more simple by the omission of the quantity k

the probability of unanimous decision is

the probability of an agreement of i voices out of the whole number is

of this class of investigations it is unnecessary to give any further account 
they have been pursued to a considerable extent by condorcet laplace pois 
son and other writers who have investigated in particular the modes of cal 
culation and reduction which are necessary to be employed when n and i are 
large numbers it is apparent that the whole inquiry is of a very speculative 
character the values of x and k cannot be determined by direct observation 

we can only presume that they must both in general exceed the value — that 
the former x must increase with the progress of public intelligence while the 
latter k must depend much upon those preliminary steps in the administration 
of the law by which persons suspected of crime are brought before the tribunal 
of their country it has been remarked by poisson that in periods of revolution 
as during the reign of terror in france the value of k may fall if account be 

taken of political offences far below the limit the history of europe in days 
nearer to our own would probably confirm this observation and would show 
that it is not from the wild license of democracy alone that the accusation of 
innocence is to be apprehended 

laplace makes the assumption that all values of x from 


x to x 

 

are equally probable he thus excludes the supposition that a juryman is more 
likely to be deceived than not but assumes that within the limits to which the 
probabilities of individual correctness of judgment are confined we have no rea 
son to give preference to one value of x over another this hypothesis is entirely 
arbitrary and it would be unavailing here to examine into its consequences 

poisson seems first to have endeavoured to deduce the values of x and k 
inferentially from experience in the six years from to inclusively 
the number of individuals accused of crimes against the person before the tri 
bunals of france was and the number of persons condemned was 
the juries consisted each of persons and the decision was pronounced by a 
simple majority assuming the above numbers to be sufficiently large for the 
estimation of probabilities there would therefore be a probability measured by 

the fraction or that an accused person would be condemned by a 

 

simple majority we should have the equation 


x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x 


 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


the general expression for xi being given by after making therein n 
in the year the law having received alteration required a majority of at 
least four persons for condemnation and the number of persons tried for crimes 
against the person during that year being and the number condemned 
the probability of the condemnation of an individual by the above majority was 
 or hence we should have 

x x x 

assuming that the values of k and x were the same for the year as for 
the previous six years the two equations and enable us to determine 
approximately their values poisson thus found 

k x 

for crimes against property during the same periods he found by a similar 
analysis 

k x 

the solution of the system conducts in each case to two values of 
k and to two values of x the one value in each pair being greater and the 

other less than it was assumed that in each case the larger value should 
be preferred it being conceived more probable that a party accused should be 
guilty than innocent and more probable that a juryman should form a correct 
than an erroneous opinion upon the evidence 

 the data employed by poisson especially those which were furnished 
by the year are evidently too imperfect to permit us to attach much 
confidence to the above determinations of x and k and it is chiefly for the sake 
of the method that they are here introduced it would have been possible to 
record during the six years or during any similar period the number 
of condemnations pronounced with each possible majority of voices the values 
of the several elements a xg x were there no reasons of policy to forbid 
might have been accurately ascertained here then the conception of the general 
problem of which poisson’s is a particular case arises how shall we from this 
apparently supernumerary system of data determine the values of x and kl 
if the hypothesis adopted by poisson and all other writers on the subject of 
the absolute independence of the events whose probabilities are denoted by x 
and k be retained we should be led to form a system of five equations of the 
type and either select from these that particular pair of equations which 
might appear to be most advantageous or combine together the equations of the 
system by the method of least squares there might exist a doubt as to whether 
the latter method would be strictly applicable in such cases especially if the 
values of x and k afforded by different selected pairs of the given equations were 
very different from each other m cournot has considered a somewhat similar 
problem in which from the records of individual votes in a court consisting of 
four judges it is proposed to investigate the separate probabilities of a correct 
verdict from each judge for the determination of the elements x x x x he 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


obtains eight equations which he divides into two sets of four equations and he 
remarks that should any considerable discrepancy exist between the values of 
x x x x determined from those sets it might be regarded as an indication 
that the hypothesis of the independence of the opinions of the judges was in 
the particular case untenable the principle of this mode of investigation has 
been adverted to in xviii 

 i proceed to apply to the class of problems above indicated the method of 
this treatise and shall inquire first whether the records of courts and delibera 
tive assemblies alone can furnish any information respecting the probabilities 
of correct judgment for their individual members and it appearing that they 
cannot secondly what kind and amount of necessary hypothesis will best com 
port with the actual data 

proposition i 

from the mere records of the decisions of a court or deliberative assembly 
it is not possible to deduce any definite conclusion respecting the correctness of 
the individual judgments of its members 

though this proposition may appear to express but the conviction of unas 
sisted good sense it will not be without interest to show that it admits of rigor 
ous demonstration let us suppose the case of a deliberative assembly consisting 
of n members no hypothesis whatever being made respecting the dependence 
or independence of their judgments let the logical symbols x • • • x n be 
employed according to the following definition viz let the generic symbol xi 
denote that event which consists in the uttering of a correct opinion by the 
i th member a t of the court we shall consider the values of prob xi prob 
x ¦ ¦ prob x n as the qiuesita of a problem the expression of whose possible 
data we must in the next place investigate 

now those data are the probabilities of events capable of being expressed 
by definite logical functions of the symbols xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x n let x x ¦ ¦ x m 
represent the functions in question and let the actual system of data be 

prob x a prob x prob x m a m 

then from the very nature of the case it may be shown that xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x m 
are functions which remain unchanged if x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n are therein changed into 
 — i — x ¦ ¦ ¦ — x n respectively thus if it were recorded that in a certain 
proportion of instances the votes given were unanimous the event whose prob 
ability supposing the instances sufficiently numerous is thence determined is 
expressed by the logical function 

xxx x n £il x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n 

a function which satisfies the above condition again let it be recorded that in 
a certain proportion of instances the vote of an individual suppose a differs 
from that of all the other members of the court the event whose probability 
is thus given will be expressed by the function 


xil x ¦¦¦ x n £ x n 



chapter xxl probability of judgements 


 


also satisfying the above conditions thus as agreement in opinion may be an 
agreement in either truth or error and as when opinions are divided either 
party may be right or wrong it is manifest that the expression of any particular 
state whether of agreement or difference of sentiment in the assembly will 
depend upon a logical function of the symbols xx ¦ ¦ x n which similarly 
involves the privative symbols — x± — x — x n but in the records of 
assemblies it is not presumed to declare which set of opinions is right or wrong 
hence the functions xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x m must be solely of the kind above described 

 now in proceeding according to the general method to determine the 
value of prob x we should first equate the functions xi x m to a new set 
of symbols from the equations 

xi — x — • • ¦ x m — t m 


thus formed we should eliminate the symbols x £ • x n and then determine 
xi as a developed logical function of the symbols tit ¦ ¦ t m expressive of 
events whose probabilities are given let the result of the above elimination be 

ex e ®i 


e and e being function of ti f t m then 


x 


e 

ee 


 


now the functions x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x m are symmetrical with reference to the sym 
bols xi x n and l — xil — x n it is evident therefore that in the equation 
e must be identical with e hence gives 


x 


e 

 ’ 


and it is evident that the only coefficients which can appear in the development 
of the second member of the above equation are and j the former will present 
itself whenever the values assigned to fi t m in determining the coefficient of 
a constituent are such as to make e the latter or an equivalent result in 
every other case hence we may represent the development under the form 


‘ c c 


 


c and d being constituents or aggregates of constituents of the symbols 
ti t ¦ ¦ ¦ t m passing then from logic to algebra we have 

prob x c 


the function v of the general rule xvii reducing in the present case to c 
the value of prob x is therefore wholly arbitrary if we except the condition 
that it must not transcend the limits and the individual values of prob 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


x prob x n are in like manner arbitrary it does not hence follow that 
these arbitrary values are not connected with each other by necessary conditions 
dependent upon the data the investigation of such conditions would however 
properly fall under the methods of chap xix 

if reverting to the final logical equation we seek the interpretation of c we 
obtain but a restatement of the original problem for since c and d together 
include all possible constituents of t t ¦ ¦ ¦ t m we have 

c d 

and since d is affected by the coefficient g it is evident that on substituting 
therein for t t ¦ ¦ ¦ t m their expressions in terms of x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n we should 
have d hence the same substitution would give now by the 
rule c is the probability that if the event denoted by c take place the event 
x will take place hence c being equal to and therefore embracing all 
possible contingencies c must be interpreted as the absolute probability of the 
occurrence of the event x 

it may be interesting to determine in a particular case the actual form of 
the final logical equation suppose then that the elements from which the 
data are derived are the records of events distinct and mutually exclusive for 
instance let the numerical data ai ¦ ¦ ¦ a m be the respective probabilities of 
distinct and definite majorities then the logical functions xi x x m being 
mutually exclusive must satisfy the conditions 

m mm mm c 


whence we have 

tit tit m c 

under these circumstances it may easily be shown that the developed logical 
value of x will be 


x — q tlfg • • • tm t tlt • • ¦ tm • • • t t m ti 


 constituents whose coefficients are 


• ¦ tm— l 
 

o 


in the above equation t stands for — ti c 

these investigations are equally applicable to the case in which the proba 
bilities of the verdicts of a jury so far as agreement and disagreement of opinion 
are concerned form the data of a problem let the logical symbol w denote 
that event or state of things which consists in the guilt of the accused person 
then the functions xi x x m of the present problem are such that no 
change would therein ensue from simultaneously converting wx x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n into 
w i x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n respectively hence the final logical value of w as well as those 
of x x — x n will be exhibited under the same form and a like general 
conclusion thence deduced 

it is therefore established that from mere statistical documents nothing can 
be inferred respecting either the individual correctness of opinion of a judge or 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


counsellor the guilt of an individual or the merits of a disputed question if the 
determination of such elements as the above can be reduced within the province 
of science at all it must be by virtue either of some assumed criterion of truth 
furnishing us with new data or of some hypothesis relative to the connexion or 
the independence of individual judgments which may warrant a new form of 
the investigation in the examination of the results of different hypotheses the 
following general proposition will be of importance 

proposition ii 

 given the probabilities of the n simple events xx ¦ ¦ ¦ x n viz — 

prob x — c prob x c prob x n c n 

also the probabilities of the m — compound events x x ¦ ¦ x m viz — 

prob xa prob x ¦¦¦ prob x m a m i 

the latter events x x m i being distinct and mutually exclusive required the 
probability of any other compound event x 

in this proposition it is supposed that xix ¦ ¦ ¦ x rn i as well as x are 
functions of the symbols x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n alone moreover the events x± x ¦ ¦ ¦ x m i 
being mutually exclusive we have 

x x x x c 

the product of any two members of the system vanishing now assume 

x t l x m it m i x t 

then t must be determined as a logical function of xi x n f m i 

now by 


tt titmi t t c 

all binary products of fit to i vanishing the developed expression for t 
can therefore only involve in the list of constituents which have or — for 
their coefficients such as contain some one of the following factors viz — 

tt ¦ ¦ ¦ t m— • • • tm— • • • t rn —m—l i 

t standing for — t c it remains to assign that portion of each constituent 
which involves the symbols xx n together with the corresponding coeffi 
cients 

since xi t i being any integer between and m — inclusive it is 
evident that 

xit 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


from the very constitution of the functions any constituent included in the 
first member of the above equation would therefore have — for its coefficient 
now let 


x m — xi x m i 


 


and it is evident that such constituents as involve t t m i as a factor and 
yet have coefficients of the form or — must be included in the expression 


xrntli ¦ ¦ ¦ tm— ¦ 


now x rn may be resolved into two portions viz x x m and — xx m the 
former being the sum of those constituents of x m which are found in x the 
latter of those which are not found in x it is evident that in the developed 
expression of t which is equivalent to x the coefficients of the constituents in 
the former portion x x rn will be while those of the latter portion — x x m 
will be hence the elements we have now considered will contribute to the 
development of t the terms 

xx m ti t m — xx m t ¦ ¦ ¦ tmi 

again since x t while x ti t t c it is evident that the only 
constituents involving tt t m i as a factor which have coefficients of the 
form or will be included in the expression 

x it ±t ¦ ¦ ¦ t m 


and reasoning as before we see that this will contribute to the development of 
t the terms 

xxitit t m — xxihh ¦ ¦ ¦ t m 

proceeding thus with the remaining terms of we deduce for the final 
expression of t 


t — xxmti ¦ ¦ ¦ tm xxitlt t m • ¦ • xx m ltl ¦ 
 — xx m tl ¦ ¦ ¦ tm — xxtlt tm 


• • tm—tm—l 

 c 


terms whose coefficients are

in this expression it is to be noted that x x m denotes the sum of those 
constituents which are common to x and x m that sum being actually given 
by multiply ing x and x m together according to the rules of the calculus of 
logic 

in passing from logic to algebra we shall represent by x x rn what the 
above product becomes when after effecting the multiplication or selecting the

one conclusion deserving of notice which is deducible from the above solu 
tion is that if the probabilities of the compound events x x m are the 
same as they would be were the events x x n entirely independent and with 
given probabilities ci c n then the probability of the event x will be the same 
as if calculated upon the same hypothesis of the absolute independence of the 
events xx n for upon the hypothesis supposed the assumption x ci

 and would give

but since x± x x m it is evident that the second member of 
 will be formed by taking all the constituents that are contained in x and 
giving them an algebraic significance and a similar remark applies to 
whence those equations respectively give 

prob x logical x algebraic 

xi — ci 

wherefore if x — fx ix x n we have 

prob x fac c n 
which is the result in question 

hence too it would follow that if the quantities ci c n were indeterminate 
and no hypothesis were made as to the possession of a mean common value the 
system would be satisfied by giving to those quantities any such values 
xi x x n as would satisfy the equations 

x — cl xm— — dm— x — u 

supposing the value of the element a like the values of ai a m i to be given 
by experience before applying the general solution to the question 
of the probability of judgments it will be convenient to make the following 
transformation let the data be 


x — c x n — c n 

prob x a prob x m a m 

and let it be required to determine prob x rn j the unknown value of which we 
will represent by a m then in and we must change 

x into x m i probx into a to i

with these transformations and observing that x m ix r except when

these equations in connexion with and enable us to determine a m i as 
a function of ci c„ a a m the numerical data supposed to be furnished 
by experience we now proceed to their application 


proposition iii 


 given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of una 
nimity or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a deliberative as 
sembly required upon a certain determinate hypothesis the mean probability of 
correct judgment for a member of the assembly 

in what way the probabilities of unanimous decision and of specific numerical 
majorities may be determined from experience has been intimated in a former 
part of this chapter adopting the notation of prop i we shall represent 
the events whose probabilities are given by the functions xix x m i it 
has appeared from the very nature of the case that these events are mutually 
exclusive and that the functions by which they are represented are symmetrical 
with reference to the symbols aq x x n those symbols we continue to use in 
the same sense as in prop i viz by aq we understand that event which consists 
in the formation of a correct opinion by the i th member of the assembly 

now the immediate data of experience are — 

prob xi ai prob x a prob x m a m 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


prob x m i — dm— i 

x x m i being functions of the logical symbols aq x n to the probabilities 
of the events denoted by which we shall assign the indeterminate value c thus 
we shall have 

prob aq prob x ¦ ¦ ¦ prob x n c 

now it has been seen prop i that the immediate data unassisted 
by any hypothesis merely conduct us to a restatement of the problem on the 
other hand it is manifest that if adopting the methods of laplace and poisson 
we employ the system alone as the data for the application of the method of 
this work finally comparing the results obtained with the experimental system 
 we are relying wholly upon a doubtful hypothesis — the independence 
of individual judgments but though we ought not wholly to rely upon this hy 
pothesis we cannot wholly dispense with it or with some equivalent substitute 
let us then examine the consequences of a limited independence of the individ 
ual judgments the conditions of limitation being furnished by the apparently 
superfluous data from the system let us by the method of this work 
determine prob x m i and comparing the result with determine c even 
here an arbitrary power of selection is claimed but it is manifest from prop 
i that something of this kind is unavoidable if we would obtain a definite so 
lution at all as to the principle of selection i apprehend that the equation 
reserved for final comparison should be that which from the magnitude of its 
numerical element a m is esteemed the most important of the primary series 
furnished by experience 

now from the mutually exclusive character of the events denoted by the 
functions x lt x ¦ x m i the concluding equations of the previous proposition 
become applicable on account of the symmetry of the same functions and the 
reduction of the system of values denoted by d to a single value c the equations 
represented by become identical the values of aqaq ¦ • • x n become equal 
and may be replaced by a single value x and we have simply

the following is the nature of the solution thus indicated 

the functions xi x m i and the values aq a m i being given in the 
data we have first 


x m — xi a m i 

dm cli u m i 


from each of the functions x x x m thus given or determined we 
must select those constituents which contain a particular symbol as aq for a 
factor this will determine the functions xxi xx c and then in all 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


the functions we must change x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n individually to x or we may regard 
any algebraic function x l in the system as expressing the probability of 
the event denoted by the logical function x on the supposition that the logical 
symbols x x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n denote independent events whose common probability is x 
on the same supposition xx would denote the probability of the concurrence 
of any particular event of the series x x ¦¦ ¦ ¦ x n with x the forms of xi 
 xxi c being determined the equation gives the value of x and this 
substituted in determines the value of the element c required of the two 
values which its solution will offer one being greater and the other less than 

the greater one must be chosen whensoever upon general considerations it 
is thought more probable that a member of the assembly will judge correctly 
than that he will judge incorrectly 

here then upon the assumed principle that the largest of the values a m 
shall be reserved for final comparison in the equation we possess a definite 
solution of the problem proposed and the same form of solution remains ap 
plicable should any other equation of the system upon any other ground as 
that of superior accuracy be similarly reserved in the place of 

 let us examine to what extent the above reservation has influenced the 
final solution it is evident that the equation is quite independent of the 
choice in question so is likewise the second member of had we reserved the 
function x instead of x m i the equation for the determination of x would 
have been 


 xm 

 


 


but the value of x thence determined would still have to be substituted in the 
same final equation we know that were the events xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n really 
independent the equations and all others of which they are types 
would prove equivalent and that the value of x furnished by any one of them 
would be the true value of c this affords a means of verifying for if that 
equation be correct it ought under the above circumstances to be satisfied by 
the assumption c x in other words the equation 


 xx j d xx jj mxx rrl — 

v v ¦ • • v x 

ai a a m 

ought on solution to give the same value of x as the equation or now 
this will be the case for since by hypothesis 

xi x xrn 

 

cl cl dm 

we have by a known theorem 

xi x x m xi x x m 

ci a a m a ci a m 


hence becomes on substituting a for xi c 


xxi xx xx m x 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


a mere identity 

whenever therefore the events ¦ ¦ x n are really independent the 
system is a correct one and is independent of the arbitrariness of the 
first step of the process by which it was obtained when the said events are not 
independent the final system of equations will possess leaving in abeyance the 
principle of selection above stated an arbitrary element but from the persistent 
form of the equation it may be inferred that the solution is arbitrary in a less 
degree than the solutions to which the hypothesis of the absolute independence 
of the individual judgments would conduct us the discussion of the limits of 
the value of c as dependent upon the limits of the value of x would determine 
such points 

these considerations suggest to us the question whether the equation 
which is symmetrical with reference to the functions xix x m free from 
any arbitrary elements and rigorously exact when the events aq x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n are 
really independent might not be accepted as a mean general solution of the 
problem the proper mode of determining this point would i conceive be to 
ascertain whether the value of x which it would afford would in general fall 
within the limits of the value of c as determined by the systems of equations 
of which the system presents the type it seems probable that under 
ordinary circumstances this would be the case independently of such consider 
ations however we may regard as itself the expression of a certain principle 
of solution viz that regarding xix ¦ x m as exclusive causes of the event 
whose probability is x we accept the probabilities of those causes ai a a m 
from experience but form the conditional probabilities of the event as dependent 
upon such causes

 c xvii prop i 


on the hypothesis of the independence of individual judgments and so deduce 
the equation i conceive this however to be a less rigorous though possibly 
in practice a more convenient mode of procedure than that adopted in the 
general solution 

 it now only remains to assign the particular forms which the algebraic 
functions x xxi c in the above equations assume when the logical func 
tion xi represents that event which consists in r members of the assembly 
voting one way and n — r members the other way it is evident that in this 
case the algebraic function x expresses what the probability of the supposed 
event would be were the events xi x ¦ ¦ ¦ x n independent and their common 
probability measured by x hence we should have by art

under the same circumstances xxi would represent the probability of the 
compound event which consists in a particular member of the assembly forming 
a correct judgment conjointly with the general state of voting recorded above

it would therefore be the probability that a particular member votes correctly 
while of the remaining n — members r — vote correctly or that the same 
member votes correctly while of the remaining n — members r vote incorrectly

proposition iv 


 given any system of probabilities drawn from recorded instances of una 
nimity or of assigned numerical majority in the decisions of a criminal court 
of justice required upon hypotheses similar to those of the last proposition the 
mean probability c of correct judgment for a member of the court and the gen 
eral probability k of guilt in an accused person 

the solution of this problem differs in but a slight degree from that of the 
last and may be referred to the same general formulae and or it is 
to be observed that as there are two elements c and k to be determined it is 
necessary to reserve two of the functions x x x to i let us suppose x 
and x m i for final comparison employing either the remaining m — functions 
in the expression of the data or the two respective sets x x x m i and 
xi x x m in either case it is supposed that there must be at least two 
original independent data if the equation be alone employed it would in 
the present instance furnish two equations which may thus be written 

aixxi a xx a m xx m 
aifcxi a kx a m kx m 

xi x x m ¦ 

these equations are to be employed in the following manner — let x x x n 
represent those events which consist in the formation of a correct opinion by 
the members of the court respectively let also w represent that event which 
consists in the guilt of the accused member by the aid of these symbols we can 
logically express the functions x x x to i whose probabilities are given 
as also the function x m then from the function x select those constituents 
which contain as a factor any particular symbol of the set x x x n and 
also those constituents which contain as a factor w in both results change 
xix x n severally into x and w into k the above results will give xxi 
and kxi effecting the same transformations throughout the system 
will upon the particular hypothesis involved determine x and k 

 we may collect from the above investigations the following facts and 
conclusions 

st that from the mere records of agreement and disagreement in the 
opinions of any body of men no definite numerical conclusions can be drawn 
respecting either the probability of correct judgment in an individual member 
of the body or the merit of the questions submitted to its consideration 


 

 



chapter xxi probability of judgements 


 


nd that such conclusions may be drawn upon various distinct hypotheses 
as — st upon the usual hypothesis of the absolute independence of individual 
judgments ndly upon certain definite modifications of that hypothesis war 
ranted by the actual data rdly upon a distinct principle of solution suggested 
by the appearance of a common form in the solutions obtained by the modifi 
cations above adverted to 

lastly that whatever of doubt may attach to the final results rests not 
upon the imperfection of the method which adapts itself equally to all hypothe 
ses but upon the uncertainty of the hypotheses themselves 

it seems however probable that with even the widest limits of hypothesis 
consistent with the taking into account of all the data of experience the devi 
ation of the results obtained would be but slight and that their mean values 
might be determined with great confidence by the methods of prop iii of 
those methods i should be disposed to give the preference to the first such a 
principle of mean solution having been agreed upon other considerations seem 
to indicate that the values of c and k for tribunals and assemblies possessing a 
definite constitution and governed in their deliberations by fixed rules would 
remain nearly constant subject however to a small secular variation depen 
dent upon the progress of knowledge and of justice among mankind there exist 
at present few if any data proper for their determination 



chapter xxii 

on the nature of science and the 
constitution of the intellect 


 what i mean by the constitution of a system is the aggregate of those 
causes and tendencies which produce its observed character when operating 
without interference under those conditions to which the system is conceived 
to be adapted our judgment of such adaptation must be founded upon a study 
of the circumstances in which the system attains its freest action produces its 
most harmonious results or fulfils in some other way the apparent design of its 
construction there are cases in which we know distinctly the causes upon which 
the operation of a system depends as well as its conditions and its end this is 
the most perfect kind of knowledge relatively to the subject under consideration 
there are also cases in which we know only imperfectly or partially the causes 
which are at work but are able nevertheless to determine to some extent the 
laws of their action and beyond this to discover general tendencies and to 
infer ulterior purpose it has thus i think rightly been concluded that there 
is a moral faculty in our nature not because we can understand the special 
instruments by which it works as we connect the organ with the faculty of 
sight nor upon the ground that men agree in the adoption of universal rules 
of conduct but because while in some form or other the sentiment of moral 
approbation or disapprobation manifests itself in all it tends wherever human 
progress is observable wherever society is not either stationary or hastening to 
decay to attach itself to certain classes of actions consentaneously and after a 
manner indicative both of permanency and of law always and everywhere the 
manifestation of order affords a presumption not measurable indeed but real 
xx of the fulfilment of an end or purpose and the existence of a ground 
of orderly causation 

 the particular question of the constitution of the intellect has it is 
almost needless to say attracted the efforts of speculative ingenuity in every 
age for it not only addresses itself to that desire of knowledge which the 
greatest masters of ancient thought believed to be innate in our species but 
it adds to the ordinary strength of this motive the inducement of a human 
and personal interest a genuine devotion to truth is indeed seldom partial 
in its aims but while it prompts to expatiate over the fair fields of outward 


 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


observation forbids to neglect the study of our own faculties even in ages the 
most devoted to material interests some portion of the current of thought has 
been reflected inwards and the desire to comprehend that by which all else is 
comprehended has only been baffled in order to be renewed 

it is probable that this pertinacity of effort would not have been maintained 
among sincere inquirers after truth had the conviction been general that such 
speculations are hopelessly barren we may conceive that it has been felt that 
if something of error and uncertainty always incidental to a state of partial 
information must ever be attached to the results of such inquiries a residue of 
positive knowledge may yet remain that the contradictions which are met with 
are more often verbal than real above all that even probable conclusions derive 
here an interest and a value from their subject which render them not unworthy 
to claim regard beside the more definite and more splendid results of physical 
science such considerations seem to be perfectly legitimate insoluble as many 
of the problems connected with the inquiry into the nature and constitution of 
the mind must be presumed to be there are not wanting others upon which 
a limited but not doubtful knowledge others upon which the conclusions of a 
highly probable analogy are attainable as the realms of day and night are not 
strictly conterminous but are separated by a crepuscular zone through which 
the light of the one fades gradually off into the darkness of the other so it may 
be said that every region of positive knowledge lies surrounded by a debateable 
and speculative territory over which it in some degree extends its influence 
and its light thus there may be questions relating to the constitution of the 
intellect which though they do not admit in the present state of knowledge of 
an absolute decision may receive so much of reflected information as to render 
their probable solution not difficult and there may also be questions relating 
to the nature of science and even to particular truths and doctrines of science 
upon which they who accept the general principles of this work cannot but be 
led to entertain positive opinions differing it may be from those which are 
usually received in the present day in what follows i shall recapitulate some 
of the more definite conclusions established in the former parts of this treatise 
and shall then indicate one or two trains of thought connected with the general 
objects above adverted to which they seem to me calculated to suggest 

 among those conclusions relating to the intellectual constitution which 
may be considered as belonging to the realm of positive knowledge we may 
reckon the scientific laws of thought and reasoning which have formed the basis 
of the general methods of this treatise together with the principles chap v by 
which their application has been determined the resolution of the domain of 
thought into two spheres distinct but coexistent iv xi the subjection of the 

 the following illustration may suffice— 

it is maintained by some of the highest modern authorities in grammar that conjunctions 
connect propositions only now without inquiring directly whether this opinion is sound or 
not it is obvious that it cannot consistently be held by any who admit the scientific principles 
of this treatise for to such it would seem to involve a denial either st of the possibility of 
performing or ndly of the possibility of expressing a mental operation the laws of which 
viewed in both these relations have been investigated and applied in the present work — 
latham on the english language sir john stoddart’s universal grammar c 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


intellectual operations within those spheres to a common system of laws xi 
the general mathematical character of those laws and their actual expression 
ii iii the extent of their affinity with the laws of thought in the domain of 
number and the point of their divergence therefrom the dominant character 
of the two limiting conceptions of universe and eternity among all the subjects 
of thought with which logic is concerned the relation of those conceptions to 
the fundamental conception of unity in the science of number — these with 
many similar results are not to be ranked as merely probable or analogical 
conclusions but are entitled to be regarded as truths of science whether they 
be termed metaphysical or not is a matter of indifference the nature of the 
evidence upon which they rest though in kind distinct is not inferior in value to 
any which can be adduced in support of the general truths of physical science 

again it is agreed that there is a certain order observable in the progress of 
all the exacter forms of knowledge the study of every department of physical 
science begins with observation it advances by the collation of facts to a pre 
sumptive acquaintance with their connecting law the validity of such presump 
tion it tests by new experiments so devised as to augment if the presumption be 
well founded its probability indefinitely and finally the law of the phaenomenon 
having been with sufficient confidence determined the investigation of causes 
conducted by the due mixture of hypothesis and deduction crowns the inquiry 
in this advancing order of knowledge the particular faculties and laws whose 
nature has been considered in this work bear their part it is evident therefore 
that if we would impartially investigate either the nature of science or the in 
tellectual constitution in its relation to science no part of the two series above 
presented ought to be regarded as isolated more especially ought those truths 
which stand in any kind of supplemental relation to each other to be considered 
in their mutual bearing and connexion 

 thus the necessity of an experimental basis for all positive knowledge 
viewed in connexion with the existence and the peculiar character of that sys 
tem of mental laws and principles and operations to which attention has been 
directed tends to throw light upon some important questions by which the 
world of speculative thought is still in a great measure divided how from the 
particular facts which experience presents do we arrive at the general proposi 
tions of science what is the nature of these propositions are they solely the 
collections of experience or does the mind supply some connecting principle of 
its own in a word what is the nature of scientific truth and what are the 
grounds of that confidence with which it claims to be received 

that to such questions as the above no single and general answer can be 
given must be evident there are cases in which they do not even need dis 
cussion instances are familiar in which general propositions merely express 
per enumerationem simplicem a fact established by actual observation in all 
the cases to which the proposition applies the astronomer asserts upon this 
ground that all the known planets move from west to east round the sun but 
there are also cases in which general propositions are assumed from observation 
of their truth in particular instances and extension of that truth to instances 
unobserved no principle of merely deductive reasoning can warrant such a 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


procedure when from a large number of observations on the planet mars ke 
pler inferred that it revolved in an ellipse the conclusion was larger than his 
premises or indeed than any premises which mere observation could give what 
other element then is necessary to give even a prospective validity to such gen 
eralizations as this it is the ability inherent in our nature to appreciate order 
and the concurrent presumption however founded that the phaenomena of na 
ture are connected by a principle of order without these the general truths of 
physical science could never have been ascertained grant that the procedure 
thus established can only conduct us to probable or to approximate results it 
only follows that the larger number of the generalizations of physical science 
possess but a probable or approximate truth the security of the tenure of 
knowledge consists in this that wheresoever such conclusions do truly represent 
the constitution of nature our confidence in their truth receives indefinite con 
firmation and soon becomes undistinguishable from certainty the existence of 
that principle above represented as the basis of inductive reasoning enables us 
to solve the much disputed question as to the necessity of general propositions 
in reasoning the logician affirms that it is impossible to deduce any conclu 
sion from particular premises modern writers of high repute have contended 
that all reasoning is from particular to particular truths they instance that in 
concluding from the possession of a property by certain members of a class its 
possession by some other member it is not necessary to establish the interme 
diate general conclusion which affirms its possession by all the members of the 
class in common now whether it is so or not that principle of order or analogy 
upon which the reasoning is conducted must either be stated or apprehended 
as a general truth to give validity to the final conclusion in this form at least 
the necessity of general propositions as the basis of inference is confirmed — a 
necessity which however i conceive to be involved in the very existence and 
still more in the peculiar nature of those faculties whose laws have been investi 
gated in this work for if the process of reasoning be carefully analyzed it will 
appear that abstraction is made of all peculiarities of the individual to which 
the conclusion refers and the attention confined to those properties by which 
its membership of the class is defined 

 but besides the general propositions which are derived by induction from 
the collated facts of experience there exist others belonging to the domain of 
what is termed necessary truth such are the general propositions of arithmetic 
as well as the propositions expressing the laws of thought upon which the general 
methods of this treatise are founded and these propositions are not only capable 
of being rigorously verified in particular instances but are made manifest in all 
their generality from the study of particular instances again there exist general 
propositions expressive of necessary truths but incapable from the imperfection 
of the senses of being exactly verified some if not all of the propositions of 
geometry are of this nature but it is not in the region of geometry alone 
that such propositions are found the question concerning their nature and 
origin is a very ancient one and as it is more intimately connected with the 
inquiry into the constitution of the intellect than any other to which allusion 
has been made it will not be irrelevant to consider it here among the opinions 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


which have most widely prevailed upon the subject are the following it has 
been maintained that propositions of the class referred to exist in the mind 
independently of experience and that those conceptions which are the subjects 
of them are the imprints of eternal archetypes with such archetypes conceived 
however to possess a reality of which all the objects of sense are but a faint 
shadow or dim suggestion plato furnished his ideal world it has on the other 
hand been variously contended that the subjects of such propositions are copies 
of individual objects of experience that they are mere names that they are 
individual objects of experience themselves and that the propositions which 
relate to them are on account of the imperfection of those objects but partially 
true lastly that they are intellectual products formed by abstraction from the 
sensible perceptions of individual things but so formed as to become what 
the individual things never can be subjects of science ie subjects concerning 
which exact and general propositions may be affirmed and there exist perhaps 
yet other views in some of which the sensible in others the intellectual or ideal 
element predominates 

now if the last of the views above adverted to be taken for it is not pro 
posed to consider either the purely ideal or the purely nominalist view and if 
it be inquired what in the sense above stated are the proper objects of science 
objects in relation to which its propositions are true without any mixture of 
error it is conceived that but one answer can be given it is that neither do 
individual objects of experience nor with all probability do the mental images 
which they suggest possess any strict claim to this title it seems to be certain 
that neither in nature nor in art do we meet with anything absolutely agreeing 
with the geometrical definition of a straight line or of a triangle or of a circle 
though the deviation therefrom may be inappreciable by sense and it may be 
conceived as at least doubtful whether we can form a perfect mental image 
or conception with which the agreement shall be more exact but it is not 
doubtful that such conceptions however imperfect do point to something be 
yond themselves in the gradual approach towards which all imperfection tends 
to disappear although the perfect triangle or square or circle exists not in 
nature eludes all our powers of representative conception and is presented to 
us in thought only as the limit of an indefinite process of abstraction yet by a 
wonderful faculty of the understanding it may be made the subject of propo 
sitions which are absolutely true the domain of reason is thus revealed to us 
as larger than that of imagination should any indeed think that we are able 
to picture to ourselves with rigid accuracy the scientific elements of form di 
rection magnitude c these things as actually conceived will in the view of 
such persons be the proper objects of science but if as seems to me the more 
just opinion an incurable imperfection attaches to all our attempts to realize 
with precision these elements then we can only affirm that the more external 
objects do approach in reality or the conceptions of fancy by abstraction to 
certain limiting states never it may be actually attained the more do the 
general propositions of science concerning those things or conceptions approach 
to absolute truth the actual deviation therefrom tending to disappear to some 
extent the same observations are applicable also to the physical sciences what 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


have been termed the “fundamental ideas” of those sciences as force polarity 
crystallization c are neither as i conceive intellectual products indepen 
dent of experience nor mere copies of external things but while on the one 
hand they have a necessary antecedent in experience on the other hand they 
require for their formation the exercise of the power of abstraction in obedience 
to some general faculty or disposition of our nature which ever prompts us 
to the research and qualifies us for the appreciation of order thus we study 
approximately the effects of gravitation on the motions of the heavenly bodies 
by a reference to the limiting supposition that the planets are perfect spheres 
or spheroids we determine approximately the path of a ray of light through 
the atmosphere by a process in which abstraction is made of all disturbing 
influences of temperature and such is the order of procedure in all the higher 
walks of human knowledge now what is remarkable in connexion with these 
processes of the intellect is the disposition and the corresponding ability to 
ascend from the imperfect representations of sense and the diversities of indi 
vidual experience to the perception of general and it may be of immutable 
truths whereever this disposition and this ability unite each series of con 
nected facts in nature may furnish the intimations of an order more exact than 
that which it directly manifests for it may serve as ground and occasion for the 
exercise of those powers whose office it is to apprehend the general truths which 
are indeed exemplified but never with perfect fidelity in a world of changeful 
phaenomena 

 the truth that the ultimate laws of thought are mathematical in their 
form viewed in connexion with the fact of the possibility of error establishes a 
ground for some remarkable conclusions if we directed our attention to the sci 
entific truth alone we might be led to infer an almost exact parallelism between 
the intellectual operations and the movements of external nature suppose any 
one conversant with physical science but unaccustomed to reflect upon the na 
ture of his own faculties to have been informed that it had been proved that 
the laws of those faculties were mathematical it is probable that after the first 
feelings of incredulity had subsided the impression would arise that the order 
of thought must therefore be as necessary as that of the material universe 
we know that in the realm of natural science the absolute connexion between 

 whewell’s philosophy of the inductive sciences pp 

 of the idea of order it has been profoundly said that it carries within itself its own 
justification or its own control the very trustworthiness of our faculties being judged by the 
conformity of their results to an order which satisfies the reason “l’idee de l’ordre a cela 
de singulier et d’eminent qu’elle porte en elle meme sa justification ou son controle pour 
trouver si nos autres facultes nous trompent ou nous ne trompent pas nous examinons si 
les notions qu’elles nous donnent s’enchainent on ne s’enchainent pas suivant un ordre qui 
satisfasse la raison” — cournot essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances admitting 
this principle as the guide of those powers of abstraction which we undoubtedly possess it 
seems unphilosophical to assume that the fundamental ideas of the sciences are not derivable 
from experience doubtless the capacities which have been given to us for the comprehension 
of the actual world would avail us in a differently constituted scene if in some form or other 
the dominion of order was still maintained it is conceivable that in such a new theatre of 
speculation the laws of the intellectual procedure remaining the same the fundamental ideas 
of the sciences might be wholly different from those with which we are at present acquainted 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


the initial and final elements of a problem exhibited in the mathematical form 
fitly symbolizes that physical necessity which binds together effect and cause 
the necessary sequence of states and conditions in the inorganic world and 
the necessary connexion of premises and conclusion in the processes of exact 
demonstration thereto applied seem to be coordinate it may possibly be a 
question to which of the two series the primary application of the term “neces 
sary” is due whether to the observed constancy of nature or to the indissoluble 
connexion of propositions in all valid reasoning upon her works historically we 
should perhaps give the preference to the former philosophically to the latter 
view but the fact of the connexion is indisputable and the analogy to which 
it points is obvious 

were then the laws of valid reasoning uniformly obeyed a very close paral 
lelism would exist between the operations of the intellect and those of external 
nature subjection to laws mathematical in their form and expression even 
the subjection of an absolute obedience would stamp upon the two series one 
common character the reign of necessity over the intellectual and the physical 
world would be alike complete and universal 

but while the observation of external nature testifies with everstrengthening 
evidence to the fact that uniformity of operation and unvarying obedience to 
appointed laws prevail throughout her entire domain the slightest attention to 
the processes of the intellectual world reveals to us another state of things the 
mathematical laws of reasoning are properly speaking the laws of right reason 
ing only and their actual transgression is a perpetually recurring phenomenon 
error which has no place in the material system occupies a large one here 
we must accept this as one of those ultimate facts the origin of which it lies 
beyond the province of science to determine we must admit that there exist 
laws which even the rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from 
violation we must ascribe to them an authority the essence of which does not 
consist in power a supremacy which the analogy of the inviolable order of the 
natural world in no way assists us to comprehend 

as the distinction thus pointed out is real it remains unaffected by any 
peculiarity in our views respecting other portions of the mental constitution if 
we regard the intellect as free and this is apparently the view most in accordance 
with the general spirit of these speculations its freedom must be viewed as 
opposed to the dominion of necessity not to the existence of a certain just 
supremacy of truth the laws of correct inference may be violated but they 
do not the less truly exist on this account equally do they remain unaffected 
in character and authority if the hypothesis of necessity in its extreme form be 
adopted let it be granted that the laws of valid reasoning such as they are 
determined to be in this work or to speak more generally such as they would 
finally appear in the conclusions of an exhaustive analysis form but a part of 
the system of laws by which the actual processes of reasoning whether right or 
wrong are governed let it be granted that if that system were known to us in 
its completeness we should perceive that the whole intellectual procedure was 
necessary even as the movements of the inorganic world are necessary and let 
it finally as a consequence of this hypothesis be granted that the phaenomena of 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


incorrect reasoning or error wheresoever presented are due to the interference 
of other laws with those laws of which right reasoning is the product still it 
would remain that there exist among the intellectual laws a number marked 
out from the rest by this special character viz that every movement of the 
intellectual system which is accomplished solely under their direction is right 
that every interference therewith by other laws is not interference only but 
violation it cannot but be felt that this circumstance would give to the laws in 
question a character of distinction and of predominance they would but the 
more evidently seem to indicate a final purpose which is not always fulfilled to 
possess an authority inherent and just but not always commanding obedience 

now a little consideration will show that there is nothing analogous to this 
in the government of the world by natural law the realm of inorganic nature 
admits neither of preference nor of distinctions we cannot separate any portion 
of her laws from the rest and pronounce them alone worthy of obedience — 
alone charged with the fulfilment of her highest purpose on the contrary all 
her laws seem to stand coordinate and the larger our acquaintance with them 
the more necessary does their united action seem to the harmony and so far 
as we can comprehend it to the general design of the system how often the 
most signal departures from apparent order in the inorganic world such as 
the perturbations of the planetary system the interruption of the process of 
crystallization by the intrusion of a foreign force and others of a like nature 
either merge into the conception of some more exalted scheme of order or lose 
to a more attentive and instructed gaze their abnormal aspect it is needless 
to remark one explanation only of these facts can be given viz that the 
distinction between true and false between correct and incorrect exists in the 
processes of the intellect but not in the region of a physical necessity as we 
advance from the lower stages of organic being to the higher grade of conscious 
intelligence this contrast gradually dawns upon us wherever the phaenomena 
of life are manifested the dominion of rigid law in some degree yields to that 
mysterious principle of activity thus although the structure of the animal 
tribes is conformable to certain general types yet are those types sometimes 
perhaps in relation to the highest standards of beauty and proportion always 
imperfectly realized the two alternatives between which art in the present 
day fluctuates are the exact imitation of individual forms and the endeavour 
by abstraction from all such to arrive at the conception of an ideal grace and 
expression never it may be perfectly manifested in forms of earthly mould 
again those teleological adaptations by which without the organic type being 
sacrificed species become fitted to new conditions or abodes are but slowly 
accomplished — accomplished however not apparently by the fateful power of 
external circumstances but by the calling forth of an energy from within life in 
all its forms may thus be contrasted with the passive fixity of inorganic nature 
but inasmuch as the perfection of the types in which it is corporeally manifested 
is in some measure of an ideal character inasmuch as we cannot precisely define 
the highest suggested excellency of form and of adaptation the contrast is less 
marked here than that which exists between the intellectual processes and those 
of the purely material world for the definite and technical character of the

mathematical laws by which both are governed places in stronger light the 
fundamental difference between the kind of authority which in their capacity 
of government they respectively exercise 

 there is yet another instance connected with the general objects of this 
chapter in which the collation of truths or facts drawn from different sources 
suggests an instructive train of reflection it consists in the comparison of the 
laws of thought in their scientific expression with the actual forms which phys 
ical speculation in early ages and metaphysical speculation in all ages have 
tended to assume there are two illustrations of this remark to which in 
particular i wish to direct attention here 

st it has been shown iii that there is a scientific connexion between 
the conceptions of unity in number and the universe in logic they occupy 
in their respective systems the same relative place and are subject to the same 
formal laws now to the greek mind in that early stage of activity — a stage 
not less marked perhaps not less necessary in the progression of the human 
intellect than the era of bacon or of newton — when the great problems of 
nature began to unfold themselves while the means of observation were as 
yet wanting and its necessity not understood the terms “universe” and “the 
one” seem to have been regarded as almost identical to assign the nature 
of that unity of which all existence was thought to be a manifestation was 
the first aim of philosophy thales sought for this fundamental unity in water 
anaximenes and diogenes conceived it to be air hippasus of metapontum 
and heraclitus the ephesian pronounced that it was fire less definite or less 
confident in his views parmenides simply declared that all existing things were 
one melissus that the universe was infinite unsusceptible of change or motion 
one like to itself and that motion was not but seemed to be in a spirit which 
to the reflective mind of aristotle appeared sober when contrasted with the 
rashness of previous speculation anaxagoras of clazomenae following perhaps 
the steps of his fellowcitizen hermotimus sought in intelligence the cause of 
the world and of its order the pantheistic tendency which pervaded many of 
these speculations is manifest in the language of xenophanes the founder of 
the eleatic school who “surveying the expanse of heaven declared that the 
one was god” perhaps there are few if any of the forms in which unity 
can be conceived in the abstract as numerical or rational in the concrete as 
a passive substance or a central and living principle of which we do not meet 
with applications in these ancient doctrines the writings of aristotle to which 
i have chiefly referred abound with allusions of this nature though of the

larger number of those who once addicted themselves to such speculations it 
is probable that the very names have perished strange but suggestive truth 
that while nature in all but the aspect of the heavens must have appeared as 
little else than a scene of unexplained disorder while the popular belief was 
distracted amid the multiplicity of its gods — the conception of a primal unity 
if only in a rude material form should have struck deepest root surviving in 
many a thoughtful breast the chills of a lifelong disappointment and an endless 
search 

ndly in equally intimate alliance with that law of thought which is ex 
pressed by an equation of the second degree and which has been termed in this 
treatise the law of duality stands the tendency of ancient thought to those forms 
of philosophical speculation which are known under the name of dualism the 
theory of empedocles which explained the apparent contradictions of nature 
by referring them to the two opposing principles of “strife” and “friendship” 
and the theory of leucippus which resolved all existence into the two ele 
ments of a plenum and a vacuum are of this nature the famous comparison of 
the universe to a lyre or a bow its “recurrent harmony” being the product of 
opposite states of tension betrays the same origin in the system of pythago 
ras which seems to have been a combination of dualism with other elements 
derived from the study of numbers and of their relations ten fundamental an 
titheses are recognised finite and infinite even and odd unity and multitude 
right and left male and female rest and motion straight and curved light and 
darkness good and evil the square and the oblong in that of alcmaeon the 
same fundamental dualism is accepted but without the definite and numerical 
limitation with which it is connected in the pythagorean system the grand 
development of this idea is however met with in that ancient manichaean doc 
trine which not only formed the basis of the religious system of persia but 
spread widely through other regions of the east and became memorable in 
the history of the christian church the origin of dualism as a speculative

opinion not yet connected with the personification of the evil principle but 
naturally succeeding those doctrines which had assumed the primal unity of 
nature is thus stated by aristotle — “since there manifestly existed in nature 
things opposite to the good and not only order and beauty but also disorder 
and deformity and since the evil things did manifestly preponderate in num 
ber over the good and the deformed over the beautiful some one else at length 
introduced strife and friendship as the respective causes of these diverse phaenor 
nena” and in greece indeed it seems to have been chiefly as a philosophical 
opinion or as an adjunct to philosophical speculation that the dualistic theory 
obtained ground the moral application of the doctrine most in accordance 
with the greek mind is preserved in the great platonic antithesis of ’’being and 
nonbeing” — the connexion of the former with whatsoever is good and true 
with the eternal ideas and the archetypal world of the latter with evil with 
error with the perishable phsenomena of the present scene the two forms of 
speculation which we have considered were here blended together nor was it 
during the youth and maturity of greek philosophy alone that the tendencies 
of thought above described were manifested ages of imitation caught up and 
adopted as their own the same spirit especially wherever the genius of plato 
exercised sway was this influence felt the unity of all real being its identity 
with truth and goodness considered as to their essence the illusion the pro 
found unreality of all merely phsenomenal existence such were the views — such 
the dispositions of thought which it chiefly tended to foster hence that strong 
tendency to mysticism which when the days of renown whether on the field of 
intellectual or on that of social enterprise had ended in greece became preva 
lent in her schools of philosophy and reached their culminating point among 
the alexandrian platonists the supposititious treatises of dionysius the are 
opagite served to convey the same influence much modified by its contact with 
aristotelian doctrines to the scholastic disputants of the middle ages it can 
furnish no just ground of controversy to say that the tone of thought thus 
encouraged was as little consistent with genuine devotion as with a sober phi 
losophy that kindly influence of human affections that homely intercourse 
with the common things of life which form so large a part of the true because 
intended discipline of our nature would be ill replaced by the contemplation 
even of the highest object of thought viewed by an excessive abstraction as 
something concerning which not a single intelligible proposition could either be 
affirmed or denied i would but slightly allude to those connected speculations 
on the divine nature which ascribed to it the perfect union of opposite quali 
ties or to the remarkable treatises of anselm designed to establish a theory

scattered through europe devoted themselves anew either to the task of solv

such inquiries are futile and vain the logical elements which underlie all these 
speculations and from which they appear to borrow at least their form it would 
be easy to trace in the outlines of more modern systems more especially in that 
association of the doctrine of the absolute unity with the distinction of the ego 
and the nonego as the type of nature which forms the basis of the philosophy 
of hegel the attempts of speculative minds to ascend to some high pinnacle 
of truth from which they might survey the entire framework and connexion of 
things in the order of deductive thought have differed less in the forms of the 
ory which they have produced than through the nature of the interpretations 
which have been assigned to those forms and herein lies the real question as 
to the influence of philosophical systems upon the disposition and the life for 
though it is of slight moment that men should agree in tracing back all the 
forms and conditions of being to a primal unity it is otherwise as concerns their 
conceptions of what that unity is and what are the kinds of relation beside that 
of mere causality which it sustains to themselves herein too may be felt the

powerlessness of mere logic the insufficiency of the profoundest knowledge of 
the laws of the understanding to resolve those problems which lie nearer to our 
hearts as progressive years strip away from our life the illusions of its golden 
dawn 

 if the extremely arbitrary character of human opinion be considered it 
will not be expected nor is it here maintained that the above are the only 
forms in which speculative men have shaped their conjectural solutions of the 
problem of existence under particular influences other forms of doctrine have 
arisen not unfrequently however masking those portrayed above 

but the wide prevalence of the particular theories which we have considered 
together with their manifest analogy with the expressed laws of thought may 
justly be conceived to indicate a connexion between the two systems as all 
other mental acts and procedures are beset by their peculiar fallacies so the 
operation of that law of thought termed in this work the law of duality may 
have its own peculiar tendency to error exalting mere want of agreement into 
contrariety and thus form a world which we necessarily view as formed of parts 
supplemental to each other framing the conception of a world fundamentally 
divided by opposing powers such with some large but hasty inductions from 
phaenomena may have been the origin of dualism — independently of the ques 
tion whether dualism is in any form a true theory or not here however it is 
of more importance to consider in detail the bearing of these ancient forms of 
speculation as revived in the present day upon the progress of real knowledge 
and upon this point i desire in pursuance of what has been said in the previous 
section to add the following remarks 

st all sound philosophy gives its verdict against such speculations if re 
garded as a means of determining the actual constitution of things it may be 
that the progress of natural knowledge tends towards the recognition of some 
central unity in nature of such unity as consists in the mutual relation of the 
parts of a system there can be little doubt and able men have speculated not 
without grounds on a more intimate correlation of physical forces than the mere 
idea of a system would lead us to conjecture further it may be that in the bo 
som of that supposed unity are involved some general principles of division and 
reunion the sources under the supreme will of much of the related variety of 
nature the instances of sex and polarity have been adduced in support of such 
a view as a supposition i will venture to add that it is not very improbable 
that in some such way as this the constitution of things without may corre 
spond to that of the mind within but such correspondence if it shall ever be 
proved to exist will appear as the last induction from human knowledge not as 
the first principle of scientific inquiry the natural order of discovery is from the 

 evidence in support of this statement will be found in the remarkable treatise recently 
published under the title the correctness of which seems doubtful of origenis philosophu 
mena the early corruptions of christianity of which it contains the record though many 
of them as is evident from their ophite character derived from the very dregs of paganism 
manifest certain persistent forms of philosophical speculation for the most part they either 
belong to the dualistic scheme or recognise three principles primary or derived between two 
of which the dualistic relation may be traced — orig phil pp

particular to the universal and it may confidently be affirmed that we have not 
yet advanced sufficiently far on this track to enable us to determine what are 
the ultimate forms into which all the special differences of nature shall merge 
and from which they shall receive their explanation 

ndly were this correspondence between the forms of thought and the 
actual constitution of nature proved to exist whatsoever connexion or relation 
it might be supposed to establish between the two systems it would in no degree 
affect the question of their mutual independence it would in no sense lead to 
the consequence that the one system is the mere product of the other a too 
great addiction to metaphysical speculations seems in some instances to have 
produced a tendency toward this species of illusion thus among the many 
attempts which have been made to explain the existence of evil it has been 
sought to assign to the fact a merely relative character — to found it upon a 
species of logical opposition to the equally relative element of good it suffices 
to say that the assumption is purely gratuitous what evil may be in the eyes of 
infinite wisdom and purity we can at the best but dimly conjecture but to us 
in all its forms whether of pain or defect or moral transgression or retributory 
wo it can wear but one aspect — that of a sad and stern reality against which 
upon somewhat more than the highest order of prudential considerations the 
whole preventive force of our nature may be exerted now what has been said 
upon the particular question just considered is equally applicable to many other 
of the debated points of philosophy such for instance as the external reality of 
space and time we have no warrant for resolving these into mere forms of the 
understanding though they unquestionably determine the present sphere of our 
knowledge and to speak more generally there is no warrant for the extremely 
subjective tendency of much modern speculation whenever in the view of the 
intellect different hypotheses are equally consistent with an observed fact the 
instinctive testimony of consciousness as to their relative value must be allowed 
to possess authority 

rdly if the study of the laws of thought avails us neither to determine the 
actual constitution of things nor to explain the facts involved in that constitu 
tion which have perplexed the wise and saddened the thoughtful in all ages — 
still less does it enable us to rise above the present conditions of our being or 
lend its sanction to the doctrine which affirms the possibility of an intuitive 
knowledge of the infinite and the unconditioned — whether such knowledge be 
sought for in the realm of nature or above that realm we can never be said 
to comprehend that which is represented to thought as the limit of an indefi 
nite process of abstraction a progression ad infinitum is impossible to finite 
powers but though we cannot comprehend the infinite there may be even sci 
entific grounds for believing that human nature is constituted in some relation 
to the infinite we cannot perfectly express the laws of thought or establish 
in the most general sense the methods of which they form the basis without 
at least the implication of elements which ordinary language expresses by the 
terms “universe” and “eternity” as in the pure abstractions of geometry so 
in the domain of logic it is seen that the empire of truth is in a certain sense 
larger than that of imagination and as there are many special departments of 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


knowledge which can only be completely surveyed from an external point so 
the theory of the intellectual processes as applied only to finite objects seems 
to involve the recognition of a sphere of thought from which all limits are with 
drawn if then on the one hand we cannot discover in the laws of thought 
and their analogies a sufficient basis of proof for the conclusions of a too dar 
ing mysticism on the other hand we should err in regarding them as wholly 
unsuggestive as parts of our intellectual nature it seems not improbable that 
they should manifest their presence otherwise than by merely prescribing the 
conditions of formal inference whatever grounds we have for connecting them 
with the peculiar tendencies of physical speculation among the ionian and italic 
philosophers the same grounds exist for associating them with a disposition of 
thought at once more common and more legitimate to no casual influences at 
least ought we to attribute that meditative spirit which then most delights to 
commune with the external magnificence of nature when most impressed with 
the consciousness of sempiternal verities — which reads in the nocturnal heavens 
a bright manifestation of order or feels in some wild scene among the hills the 
intimations of more than that abstract eternity which had rolled away ere yet 
their dark foundations were laid 

 refraining from the further prosecution of a train of thought which to 
some may appear to be of too speculative a character let us briefly review 
the positive results to which we have been led it has appeared that there ex 
ist in our nature faculties which enable us to ascend from the particular facts 
of experience to the general propositions which form the basis of science as 
well as faculties whose office it is to deduce from general propositions accepted 
as true the particular conclusions which they involve it has been seen that 
those faculties are subject in their operations to laws capable of precise scien 
tific expression but invested with an authority which as contrasted with the 
authority of the laws of nature is distinct sui generis and underived further 
there has appeared to be a manifest fitness between the intellectual procedure 
thus made known to us and the conditions of that system of things by which we 
are surrounded — such conditions i mean as the existence of species connected 
by general resemblances of facts associated under general laws together with 
that union of permanency with order which while it gives stability to acquired 
knowledge lays a foundation for the hope of indefinite progression human 
nature quite independently of its observed or manifested tendencies is seen to 
be constituted in a certain relation to truth and this relation considered as a 
subject of speculative knowledge is as capable of being studied in its details 
is moreover as worthy of being so studied as are the several departments of 
physical science considered in the same aspect i would especially direct at 
tention to that view of the constitution of the intellect which represents it as 
subject to laws determinate in their character but not operating by the power 
of necessity which exhibits it as redeemed from the dominion of fate without 
being abandoned to the lawlessness of chance we cannot embrace this view 
without accepting at least as probable the intimations which upon the principle

of analogy it seems to furnish respecting another and a higher aspect of our 
nature — its subjection in the sphere of duty as well as in that of knowledge 
to fixed laws whose authority does not consist in power — its constitution with 
reference to an ideal standard and a final purpose it has been thought indeed 
that scientific pursuits foster a disposition either to overlook the specific differ 
ences between the moral and the material world or to regard the former as in 
no proper sense a subject for exact knowledge doubtless all exclusive pursuits 
tend to produce partial views and it may be that a mind long and deeply 
immersed in the contemplation of scenes over which the dominion of a physical 
necessity is unquestioned and supreme may admit with difficulty the possibility 
of another order of things but it is because of the exclusiveness of this devo 
tion to a particular sphere of knowledge that the prejudice in question takes 
possession if at all of the mind the application of scientific methods to the 
study of the intellectual phaenomena conducted in an impartial spirit of inquiry 
and without overlooking those elements of error and disturbance which must be 
accepted as facts though they cannot be regarded as laws in the constitution 
of our nature seems to furnish the materials of a juster analogy 

 if it be asked to what practical end such inquiries as the above point it 
may be replied that there exist various objects in relation to which the courses 
of men’s actions are mainly determined by their speculative views of human 
nature education considered in its largest sense is one of those objects the 
ultimate ground of all inquiry into its nature and its methods must be laid in 
some previous theory of what man is what are the ends for which his several 
faculties were designed what are the motives which have power to influence 
them to sustained action and to elicit their most perfect and most stable results 
it may be doubted whether these questions have ever been considered fully 
and at the same time impartially in the relations here suggested the highest 
cultivation of taste by the study of the pure models of antiquity the largest 
acquaintance with the facts and theories of modern physical science viewed 
from this larger aspect of our nature can only appear as parts of a perfect 
intellectual discipline looking from the same point of view upon the means to 
be employed we might be led to inquire whether that all but exclusive appeal 
which is made in the present day to the spirit of emulation or cupidity does 
not tend to weaken the influence of those more enduring motives which seem to 
have been implanted in our nature for the immediate end in view upon these 
and upon many other questions the just limits of authority the reconciliation 
of freedom of thought with discipline of feelings habits manners and upon 
the whole moral aspect of the question — what unfixedness of opinion what 
diversity of practice do we meet with yet in the sober view of reason there 
is no object within the compass of human endeavours which is of more weight 
and moment than this considered as i have said in its largest meaning now 
whatsoever tends to make more exact and definite our view of human nature in 
any of its real aspects tends in the same proportion to reduce these questions 
into narrower compass and restrict the limits of their possible solution thus 
may even speculative inquiries prove fruitful of the most important principles 
of action 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


 perhaps the most obviously legitimate bearing of such speculations would 
be upon the question of the place of mathematics in the system of human knowl 
edge and the nature and office of mathematical studies as a means of intellec 
tual discipline no one who has attended to the course of recent discussions can 
think this question an unimportant one those who have maintained that the 
position of mathematics is in both respects a fundamental one have drawn one 
of their strongest arguments from the actual constitution of things the material 
frame is subject in all its parts to the relations of number all dynamical chem 
ical electrical thermal actions seem not only to be measurable in themselves 
but to be connected with each other even to the extent of mutual convertibility 
by numerical relations of a perfectly definite kind but the opinion in question 
seems to me to rest upon a deeper basis than this the laws of thought in all 
its processes of conception and of reasoning in all those operations of which 
language is the expression or the instrument are of the same kind as are the 
laws of the acknowledged processes of mathematics it is not contended that it 
is necessary for us to acquaint ourselves with those laws in order to think coher 
ently or in the ordinary sense of the terms to reason well men draw inferences 
without any consciousness of those elements upon which the entire procedure 
depends still less is it desired to exalt the reasoning faculty over the faculties 
of observation of reflection and of judgment but upon the very ground that 
human thought traced to its ultimate elements reveals itself in mathematical 
forms we have a presumption that the mathematical sciences occupy by the 
constitution of our nature a fundamental place in human knowledge and that 
no system of mental culture can be complete or fundamental which altogether 
neglects them 

but the very same class of considerations shows with equal force the error 
of those who regard the study of mathematics and of their applications as a 
sufficient basis either of knowledge or of discipline if the constitution of the 
material frame is mathematical it is not merely so if the mind in its capacity 
of formal reasoning obeys whether consciously or unconsciously mathematical 
laws it claims through its other capacities of sentiment and action through its 
perceptions of beauty and of moral fitness through its deep springs of emotion 
and affection to hold relation to a different order of things there is moreover 
a breadth of intellectual vision a power of sympathy with truth in all its forms 
and manifestations which is not measured by the force and subtlety of the 
dialectic faculty even the revelation of the material universe in its boundless 
magnitude and pervading order and constancy of law is not necessarily the 
most fully apprehended by him who has traced with minutest accuracy the steps 
of the great demonstration and if we embrace in our survey the interests and 
duties of life how little do any processes of mere ratiocination enable us to 
comprehend the weightier questions which they present as truly therefore as 
the cultivation of the mathematical or deductive faculty is a part of intellectual 
discipline so truly is it only a part the prejudice which would either banish 
or make supreme any one department of knowledge or faculty of mind betrays 
not only error of judgment but a defect of that intellectual modesty which is 
inseparable from a pure devotion to truth it assumes the office of criticising 



chapter xxii constitution of the intellect 


 


a constitution of things which no human appointment has established or can 
annul it sets aside the ancient and just conception of truth as one though 
manifold much of this error as actually existent among us seems due to 
the special and isolated character of scientific teaching — which character it 
in its turn tends to foster the study of philosophy notwithstanding a few 
marked instances of exception has failed to keep pace with the advance of the 
several departments of knowledge whose mutual relations it is its province to 
determine it is impossible however not to contemplate the particular evil in 
question as part of a larger system and connect it with the too prevalent view of 
knowledge as a merely secular thing and with the undue predominance already 
adverted to of those motives legitimate within their proper limits which are 
founded upon a regard to its secular advantages in the extreme case it is not 
difficult to see that the continued operation of such motives uncontrolled by 
any higher principles of action uncorrected by the personal influence of superior 
minds must tend to lower the standard of thought in reference to the objects 
of knowledge and to render void and ineffectual whatsoever elements of a noble 
faith may still survive and ever in proportion as these conditions are realized 
must the same effects follow hence perhaps it is that we sometimes find juster 
conceptions of the unity the vital connexion and the subordination to a moral 
purpose of the different parts of truth among those who acknowledge nothing 
higher than the changing aspect of collective humanity than among those who 
profess an intellectual allegiance to the father of lights but these are questions 
which cannot further be pursued here to some they will appear foreign to 
the professed design of this work but the consideration of them has arisen 
naturally either out of the speculations which that design involved or in the 
course of reading and reflection which seemed necessary to its accomplishment
