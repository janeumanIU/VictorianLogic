my dear sir 

to your valued instructions in manchester college 
york i am indebted for much of the pleasure which i 
have occasionally derived from metaphysical inquiries 
and discussions in the metaphysical as well as theo 
logical department of that institution we were taught to 
study with care and candour the best works not to cavil 
and confute nor to beheve and take for granted but 
to weigh and consider to you therefore as one well 
skilled in weighing arguments and detecting fallacies 
i beg leave to inscribe this little volume and remain

preface 



the remarks here offered to the reader 
were commenced some time ago with the 
design of adapting them to the pages of a 
review or magazine hence they have 
perhaps too much of a critical and contro 
versial air for a distinct essay on an abstract 
subject but the remarks grew under my 
hands and becoming as they grew less and 
less fit for any existing periodical they are 
now presented but with great diffidence in

reader of course will judge 

the wellinstructed student of mathema 
tics of logic of the nature and theory of 
language and of what is called moral evi 
dence will be apt to remark at the close of the 
work that it makes no specific addition to the 
amount of his knowledge but if the views 
presented even to him be admitted to be 
correct as far as they go if some thoughts 
are here conveniently brought together which 
must at least be sought for in widelyscat 
tered sources if they have the good effect of 
awakening the attention of the less profound 
to important points connected with the sub 
ject before him hitherto overlooked if they 
suggest or stimulate inquiries worthy of con

of others so as to form a sort of philo 
sophical discussion in which many authors

on the origin of evil — 

 a writer often does more good by show 
ing the use of some of those many volumes 
which we have already than by offering new 
ones though this be of much less advantage

remarks 



it is more than a century since locke con 
ceived and maintained after hobbes and 
perhaps others that demonstrative reasoning 
was applicable to other subjects besides the 
mathematics and particularly to morahty 
doctors law and hartley the disciples and 
successors of locke entered fully into his 
views and dr hartley especially was fond of 
exhibiting his reasoning in a mathematical 
form and in some instances has very happily 
applied algebraic formulae to illustrate i do 
not say to confirm his trains of moral spe 
culation 

mr whewells thoughts on mathematics 
in which he affirms that mathematics afford 
the best example of practical logic and the 
elaborate article in the edinburgh review 

b 



 introductory remarks 

no on mathematical studies which 
treats generally of the influence of mathe 
matics upon the intellectual character and 
powers have in some degree recalled atten 
tion to the subject and induced me to offer 
some thoughts upon it which i trust will not 
appear altogether unworthy of perusal 

i do this with earnestness and even anxiety 
not because i conceive that anything original 
or remarkable will be found in the following 
observations for i bear in mind an aphorism 
of dr johnson he who tries to say that 
which has never been said before him will 
probably say that which will never be re 
peated after him but because clear and 
just views on this subject have a close and 
important bearing upon the pursuit of science 
of all kinds whether physical or metaphy 
sical upon the attainment and diffusion of 
truth upon the mental and moral improve 
ment and consequently the harmony and 
happiness of man these clear and just 
views appear to be absent from the minds 
and writings of many whose names are of 
no smau account in the literary and scientific 



introductory remarks 

world although within easy reach of the in 
quiring if they will use the glass supplied 
by the plain and manly writers of the true 
english school of philosophy 

i venture upon it further because mr 
whewell in the second edition of his pam 
phlet declines going more at length into the 
matters touched upon by the reviewer he 
has therefore left the field open to any one 
who may dare to enter the usts against that 
formidable and heavilyarmed knight 

the interest which may have been felt in 
the papers alluded to has perhaps already 
subsided but the subject to which they re 
late is of permanent importance mr 
whewell discussed the relative value of 
different modes of pursuing mathematical 
studies assuming their usefulness and im 
portance the reviewer however went 
into a much wider field namely the 
influence of mathematical studies upon the 
mental powers and character in general 
and it was his strain of remark so far as it 
was of a metaphysical character his obser 
vations about two logics dissimilar de 

b 



 introductory remarks 

velopments of thought and higher and 
lower faculties which induced me to review 
the reviewer and put together a few thoughts 
upon the nature of reasoning and evidence in 
general with many of the positions of the 
reviewer and of those whom he quotes about 
mathematical evidence and mathematical pro 
cesses the matter of this essay will be found 
substantially to coincide but if there be 
any truth in his view of the disquaufication 
of mere mathematicians for inquiries into 
mental and moral philosophy i have en 
deavoured to approach more closely to the 
sources of that disquaufication or rather so to 
point out the distinction between the nature 
of our thoughts and language on mathe 
matical and other subjects as to furnish 
some useful guidance to reasoners and in 
quirers in morals and religion 

moreover while it seemed to me that the 
reviewer had merely taken occasion from 
mr whewells pamphlet to propound cer 
tain semigerman notions and heap together 
certain kantian phrases than which none 
are more utterly distasteful to a healthful 



definitions 

english palate it is perceptible if i mis 
take not that mr whewell himself is not 
altogether so clear and satisfactory as he 
might be his own mind being apparently 
tainted in some slight degree with german 
phraseology and metaphysics but i shall 
not trespass further upon ground which lies 
beyond the limits which it is my present in 
tention to occupy nor detain the reader from 
the real subject before us 

now in order to perceive the possible ap 
plication of mathematical or demonstrative 
reasoning to metaphysical subjects the first 
requisite is to understand exactly the nature 
of that reasoning in order to do this i ob 
serve then — 

first that it is the important character 
istic of mathematical reasoning to proceed 
from definitions it sets out from these as 
precise data to which appeal is made in 
every step of the demonstrative process if 
these definitions be not clearly understood 
if they be not fully granted and well laid up 
in the mind in vain does the student or 
pupil attempt to proceed the foundations 



b definitions 

of the science will then be broken up the 
field of mathematical reasoning will then be 
closed for these are the gate of entrance 

it affects not the truth of the above 
position to inquire and settle whether the 
definitions are hypotheses or facts whether 
they be explanations of terms abstractions 
of the mind inductions from observation or 
assumptions which have no foimdation in 
the nature of things nor to inquire whether 
the definitions of any particular treatise or 
mathematician from eucud and his nume 
rous editors downwards to newton and his 
successors are in every respect the best 
possible such as suit best the subsequent 
course of reasoning are most easily ad 
mitted by the student or bring most clearly 
before the mind the principle necessary for 
future guidance nor to inquire how far the 
postulates and axioms partake of the nature 
of definitions may be resolved into them or 
may be dispensed with altogether without 
injury to the study these may be proper 
subjects for the metaphysician or logician 
they may to a certain degree call for the 



definitions 

early attention of the mathematical student 
but the tutor who should begin with telling 
his pupil all that has been said or might be 
said about the definitions postulates and 
axioms would probably never get him over 
the asses bridge suffice it as a matter of 
fact that when you open any elementary 
treatise on mathematics euclid the conic 
sections plane and spherical trigonometry 
and even books of arithmetic and algebra 
the first objects of careful attention to the 
student are definitions these are the foun 
dations of his science the elements of his 
reasoning to these he must adhere and 
if there be anything inconsistent with them 
confusion ensues demonstration ceases 

it is in this last circumstance i mean 
the pecuuarity of reasoning from definitions 
that the true theory of mathematical reason 
ing is to be found says dugald stewart in 
his chapter on mathematical reasoning 
chap ii sect of his second volume of the 
philosophy of the human mind one of the 
best portions of his writings yet tinctured 
deeply with his pecuuar faults this is the 



 definitions 

point upon which he rests and the writers 
to whom he refers and with quotations from 
whom he is so fond of nibbung will be found 
substantially to agree with him 

the following passage from hobbes le 
viathan is also apt to my purpose to 
the priviledge of absurdity no uving crea 
ture is subject but man onely and of 
men those are of all most subject to it 
that professe philosophy for it is most 
true that cicero saith of them somewhere 
that there can be nothing so absurd but may 
be found in the books of philosophers and 
the reason is manifest for there is not one 
of them that begins his ratiocination from 
the definitions or explications of the names 
they are to use which is a method they are 
to use onely in geometry whose conclusions 
have thereby been made indisputable — 
part i chap v 

the importance of the definitions admits 
of the following familiar illustrations it 
happened to me to commence the study of 
euclid with a youth who stumbled at the 
first definition — a point is that which hatk 



definitions 

no parts or which hath no magnitude 
 then said he it is a nonentity — it is 
nothing he could not or he would not 
admit such an abstraction and he began to 
puzzle himself about the infinite divisibility of 
matter the nature and extension of ultimate 
atoms the impossibiuty of finding a given 
place for that which had no parts and so on 
he was not content to take this or any other 
definition as a matter of course and wait to 
see how far the mathematician would be 
consistent with himself in his subsequent 
reasoning he was determined to weigh and 
settle the justness of every definition in his 
own mind before he would proceed further 
in short he would concede nothing and dis 
pute everything consequently he never 
took kindly to mathematical studies and 
perhaps to this hour he looks upon mathe 
matics as a multitude of words about non 
entities or things which have no real ex 
istence and consequently no practical value 
i by no means imply that in mathematics 
the student is to begin with submitting to 
authority and not to think about the 

b 



 definitions decide 

meaning of the language he uses nor 
that the tutor should not be prepared to 
defend his own prehminary statements of 
this perhaps more hereafter it is sufficient 
to add at present that mr de morgan in 
his work on mathematical studies pubushed 
by the society for the diffusion of useful 
knowledge ranks definition first among the 
characteristics and i may say as at the 
foundation of mathematical reasoning 

secondly y it may appear to many super 
fluous but it is important to observe that 
the definitions on which mathematical rea 
soning depends are definitions properly so 
called that is they are explanations of terms 
—determinations of that sense in which the 
words employed as signs and instruments of 
thought are to be taken used and under 
stood 

every one who reads over the definitions 
of euclid must i should think immediately 
assent to this one definition may be 
better than another of a line or a straight 
line of a circle or of parallel unes but 
its superiority can only consist in fixing 



the meaning of terms 

more clearly that sense of the word about 
to be used or that quality in the minds con 
ception of the thing signified more simply 
the signification which alone is to be pre 
sent to the mind in its subsequent appu 
cation of the term 

the definitions of geometry concern it is 
obvious the meaning of the terms point 
une straight une superficies angle triangle 
circle and so on so far as they are de 
finable and the student would have 
uttle occasion to pore over these definitions 
if all the terms were previously famiuar 
to him and all had that fixed and clear 
meaning in his mind that is were the signs 
of those certain ideas of figure for which 
they stand in the mind of the geometrical 
reasoner 

if mr dugald stewart had kept eucud 
open before him when speaking of the 
definitions i can scarcely imagine he would 
ever have called them hypotheses and if he 
had not called them hypotheses he would 
not have maintained that it is the pecuuarity 
of mathematical reasoning to employ hypo 



 definitions decide 

theses instead of facts as the data on which 
we proceed see stewarts philosophy 
vol ii pp 

take for example the ninth and eleventh 
definitions a plane rectiuneal angle is 
the incunation of two straight lines to one 
another which meet together but are not in 
the same straight une an obtuse angle 
is that which is greater than a right angle 
with what propriety can it be said that 
these are hypotheses an hypothesis is 
that mode of accounting for certain appear 
ances which although probable remains to 
be verified by future experiments or obser 
vations or it is the supposed cause of certain 
effects whose adequacy or invariable an 
tecedency is assumed until disproved by 
further investigation this is the sense in 
which the term hypothesis is generally em 
ployed in this sense the ptolemaic and 
tychobrahic systems of astronomy were 
hypotheses in this sense the theory of 
gravitation as it first occurred to the mind 
of sir isaac newton as accounting for the 
phases and motions of the heavenly bodies 



the meaning of terms 

was an hypothesis in this sense the undu 
latory theory of light is an hypothesis 

now there is no analogy between this 
meaning of the term hjrpothesis and the 
definitions of geometry or of any branch of 
mathematical science these definitions are 
not imaginary explanations of given pheno 
mena nor supposed causes of given effects 
they are as above said simple explanations 
of terms or attempts by the substitution of 
other words in place of one general term to 
place before the mind often assisted by 
diagram or sensible representation to the 
eye that object of thought to which the 
said term is invariably and solely to be ap 
pued every general term says aristotle 
 is the abridgement of a definition 

i observe that mr de morgan on the 
study of mathematics p places reason 
ing from hypothesis second among the 
characteristics of geometrical reasoning in 
the statement of every proposition he says 
 certain connexions are supposed to exist 
from which it is asserted that certain con 
sequences will follow thus in an isosceles 



 definitions decide 

triangle the angles at the base are equal or 
if a triangle be isosceles the angles at the 
base will be equal here the hypothesis or 
supposition is that the triangle has two 
equal sides the consequence asserted is that 
the angles at the base or third side will be 
equal 

let us remark however that still the 
hypothesis impues a clear understanding of 
the words employed as m the above in 
stance isosceles and triangle both of which 
have been clearly defined and are well under 
stood hypothesis here is strictly and merely 
supposition a certain figure or relation of 
unes is supposed or granted to exist from 
which certain consequences are deduced 
the reasoning would not be valid or there 
would be no reasoning at all if the terms 
employed did not in the first instance ex 
actly express the thing intended — the object 
of thought much of common reasoning is 
reasoning from hypothesis in this sense 
that is it consists in supposing certain re 
lations to exist and in showing that certain 
consequences follow 



the meaning of terms 

it was not in this sense that mr dugald 
stewart maintained that in mathematics 
we employ hypotheses instead of facts as a 
general proposition but rather with intent 
to show that the whole of mathematics 
rested upon assumptions and therefore dif 
fered from reasonings which turn upon ob 
servation and what he calls facts he often 
impues that mathematical reasoning remains 
good though there be no such things in 
reality as points unes triangles circles and 
squares in the mathematical sense but if 
it be so even admitting all this still let us 
remember that the hypotheses or assump 
tions so far as the definitions are included 
in them are of a certain kind namely that 
certain words shall invariably be associated 
with certain meanings or ideas and no 
other for example that you shall not 
reason about a triangle as if it could possibly 
mean a circle nor about parallel unes as if 
they were not equidistant at all points 

 it is not on the definition but the con 
ception mr whewell asserts that the 
properties and demonstrations are built 



 definitions decide 

but why separate definition and concep 
tion are they not virtually the same thing 
unless by definition we are to understand 
mere words without signification uttle black 
marks upon a piece of white paper the 
definition is of value solely in fixing and s 
it were embodying the conception human 
beings reason with words which are the signs 
or channels of ideas you can only convey 
your conception of a straight une or triangle 
to another mind by a definition or descrip 
tion it is the object of the definition to single 
out that quality or property in the minds 
conception of the thing which distinguishes 
it most completely from every other object 
or thing whatsoever and which by being so 
distinguished and having such settled pro 
perty becomes the subject of reasoning if 
it belonged for instance to anything else 
besides an angle to be composed of two 
straight hues meeting together but not in the 
same straight line in these words we should 
have no sufficient definition of an angle 

in the appendix to his work on the con 
nexion of number and magnitude mr 



the meaning of terms 

de morgan makes some admirable and use 
ful observations on the definitions postulates 
and axioms of euclid and thus expresses 
himself — some of the definitions contain 
assumptions of certain conceptions existing 
to which names are to be given namely 
those of a point a une the extremities of a 
line a straight line a surface the extremi 
ties of a surface a plane surface a plane 
angle a plane rectilineal angle others 
assume the possibiuty of certain relations 
existing as will appear from the form in 
which they are put 

he afterwards speaks of these as in 
definable notions and places the common 
definitions of them in the light of postulates 
thus let it be granted that a point has no 
parts or magnitude and that we are con 
cerned with no other property of it if there 
be any again he speaks of some of the 
definitions those from the eleventh to the 
fourteenth and from the nineteenth to the 
twentythird as purely nominal and there 
fore needing no remark from the tenor of 
his language which the reader who is not 



 definitions decide 

acquainted with it will do well to consult it 
would seem that he considered the geometry 
of eucud as resting very much on common 
notions xoivtj cvvoia which scarcely admit of 
definition nevertheless i do not think that 
his language countenances any separation 
between the conception and what is usually 
considered the definition but the contrary 
the object of all the definitions clearly is 
to associate a certain term with a particular 
notion or conception and thus to fix and 
umit the meaning of the term in his paper 
on the study of mathematics mr de mor 
gan says p this ie definition is 
merely substituting instead of a description 
the name which it has been agreed to give to 
whatever bears that description 

in regard to nominal definition it is to my 
purpose to quote here what dr whateley 
says in his elements of logic p fifth 
edition and although i begin the quotation 
in the middle of a sentence no alteration is 
made in its force or meaning — all that is 
requisite for the purposes of reasoning 
which is the proper province of logic is 



the meaning of terms 

that a term shall not be used in diiferent 
senses a real definition of anything belongs 
to the science or system which is employed 
about that thing it is to be noted that in 
mathematics and indeed in all strict sciences 
the nominal and the real definition exactly 
coincide the meaning of the word and the 
nature of the thing being exactly the same 
this holds good also with respect to logical 
terms most legal and many ethical terms 

upon the whole we conclude that the 
definitions of geometry settle the meaning of 
terms 

thirdly y these terms are the signs of our 
ideas of figure and quantity including in the 
latter term number and magnitude both the 

 pascal in his reflexions sur la gometrie en gndral 
justly observes however that many notions are assumed 
and terms are used in mathematics which are not defined 
 cette judicieuse science est bien loigne de definir ces 
mots primitifs espace temps mouvement galit ma 
jority diminution tout et les autres que le monde entend 
de soimme and this must be the case in all reason 
ing for as definition is merely explaining one term by 
many it is obvious we might go on defining without 
end and not advance a step towards any valuable con 
clusion 



 mathematical conceptions 

how many and how great quantus which 
ideas or notions come to us so to speak 
originally from without i e they originate 
in sensible impressions they are not signifi 
cant merely of what passes within or of 
mental states uke the terms memory the 
will judgement attention and desire unless 
indeed every sensation such as of whiteness 
or blackness be considered a mental state 
and every idea an affection of the mind 

here perhaps i am treading upon the 
most doubtful because metaphysical ground 
right or wrong however in what may be said 
under this head it will not invalidate what 
has been said about ddinition and its object 
it appears to me that mathematical reasoning 
consists in tracing the relations of our ideas 
of figure and quantity by means of exactly 
defined symbols whether words diagrams 
or other symbols one with another in re 
spect of agreement or disagreement equa 
lity or inequauty and these terms and ideas 
receive clearness and strength by constant 
application and reference to external things 
or sensible impressions and also by their 



originate in sensible impressions 

observed clear uniform and welldefined 
relation to each other 

the subject matter of mathematical reason 
ing may therefore be considered to be real 
existencies with as much justice as the sub 
ject matter of any other reasoning for in 
all reasoning what has the mind before it 
but its own abstractions or notions and 
terms affixed to those notions and who 
can say that circles angles squares lines 
have not as much foundation in and refer 
ence to things as they exist as white blue 
black soft hard or other qualities of body 
solid liquid brittle or elastic or the ab 
stract ideas of space time beauty honour 
virtue and so on our ideas of number 
and figure are ideas constantly forced upon 
us by sensible objects and all that fills this 
visible diurnal sphere the terms significant 
of these ideas are in constant use and appli 
cation in ordinary ufe they are employed 
by the humblest in station and education 
with uniformity of meaning with clearness 
and accuracy for their purposes it is true 
they may not know anything of the rela 



 diagrams 

tions and properties of triangles squares 
circles parallelograms as traced by the ma 
thematician but the mathematicians skill 
and wisdom consist only in having traced 
and studied these relations by means of his 
exact definitions and by his deeper or more 
frequent meditation on their several con 
nexions and consequences the ideas or 
notions of number and figure are common to 
all minds attention and instruction only 
are necessary to furnish them with the exact 
definitions and new combinations in num 
ber it is obvious that the terms or figures are 
themselves definitions or their equivalents 

it is because the subject matter of mathe 
matical reasoning consists in our ideas of 
figures and magnitudes or quantities that 
the reasoning may be carried on by other 
signs than words viz sensible diagrams 
the arabic numerals and the notations of 
algebra are artificial contrivances or abbre 
viated symbols for tracing the relations of 
quantity as they are wanted or as those re 
lations follow from the nature of the con 
trivances themselves these diagrams these 




diagrams 

figures and notations are the signs and in 
struments of the mathematicians or alge 
braists thoughts and it is because they are 
always of a clear and certain nature and 
bear a uniform fixed and definite relation 
one to another that the geometrical reason 
ing and the arithmetical and algebraic pro 
cesses are the same to every mind 

upon this circimistance namely the power 
of fixing the attention and carrying on the 
reasoning by means or help of sensible dia 
grams locke fastens as of the first import 
ance and the great pecuuarity in mathema

 that which has given the advantage to 
the ideas of quantity and made them thought 
more capable of certainty and demonstration 
is first that they can be set down and 
represented by visible marks which have a 
greater and nearer correspondence with them

lies open to the view and cannot be mistaken 
it remains unchangeable and may at leisure 
be considered and examined and the demon 
stration be revised and all the parts of it 
may be gone over more than once without 
any danger of the least change in the ideas 
this cannot be thus done in moral ideas we 
have no sensible marks that resemble them 
whereby we can set them down — booklv 
chap iii § 

it matters not that he is the best mathe 
matician or arithmetician who needs least 
the sensible diagram or the figure on the 
paper nor to say with mr stewart that 
the figure on paper cannot pretend to that 
precise exactness which is the object of our 
reasoning that the line we draw will have 
some breadth and the circle however steady 
the instrument and the hand may deviate in 
some point from equidistance the most 
skilful reasoners can only have a certain 
idea of visible figure and of the relation 
of its several parts present to their minds 
which the less skilful require for facility and 
permanency of reference on the paper the 



diagrams 

diagram approaches sufficiently to sensible 
exactness to keep before the mind that qua 
lity of the figure which is the sole object of the 
reasoning and it is sufficient that the more 
nearly the specific figure before us approaches 
to exactness the more appucable will the 
reasoning be to that figure — or more cor 
rectly it is only in so far as the figure fairly 
represents the minds view of its quauties 
that the reasoning applies to it at all there 
is no such mystery in the most obscure of 
the definitions as to make us deny their re 
ference to a certain specific quauty of ob 
jects that is to real existencies in the 
only practical sense of the words the 
constant application of mathematical rea 
sonings to the various branches of natural 
philosophy and the common use of mathe 
matical terms in the mathematical sense 
prove the contrary we speak for in 
stance of the line between one shade of 
colour and another and length without 
breadth is the only object of the minds 
contemplation in so speaking points and 
angles are words of perpetual occurrence the

former in the sense of the commencement or 
termination of lines without being any de 
cided parts or given portions of the une 
and the latter in the sense of the meeting of 
two or more lines together converging or 
diverging with more or less of rapidity or 
extension 

it is perhaps of uttle consequence to de 
termine whence we get the notions or con 
ceptions upon which mathematical reasoning 
turns whilst it is certain we have the notions 
and defined terms appropriate to them ex 
cept in so far as it appears that in numerical 
calculations and in the geometry of eucud 
there is a certain verification of the reasoning 
by an appeal to the evidence of the senses 
in fact it is hard to divine whence we get 
notions of figure or quantity if it be not 
from the sight and the touch or from expe 
rience — a word of extensive signification 
comprehending all the results of observation 
and reflection those who say we do not 
get these notions or conceptions from expe 
rience would do well to tell us whence we do 
get them or produce the mathematician 



derived from the senses 

upon whom god has not bestowed the five 
senses with which he has happily blessed the 
rest of mankind 

i will here venture a remark upon mr 
whewells language in his pamphlet on ma 
thematical studies second edition p 

 i mentioned it says mr whewell as 
likely to make the study of mathematics 
less beneficial as a mental discipline than it 
might otherwise be if the first principles of 
our knowledge be represented as borrowed 
from experience in such a manner that the 
whole science becomes empirical only 

 i will not suppose that any person who 
has paid any attention to mathematics does 
not see clearly the difference between neces 
sary truths and empirical facts — between 
the evidence of the properties of a triangle 
and that of the general laws of the structure 
of plants the peculiar character of mathe 
matical truth is that it is necessarily and 
inevitably true and one of the most im 
portant lessons which we learn from our ma 
thematical studies is a knowledge that there 

c 



 mathematical notions 

are such truths and a familiarity with their 
form and character 

this lesson is not only lost but read 
backwards if the student is taught that 
there is no such diflference and that mathe 
matical truths themselves are learnt by ex 
perience i can hardly suppose that any 
mathematician would hold such an opinion 
with regard to geometrical truths although 
it has been entertained by metaphysicians of 
no inconsiderable acuteness as hume we 
might ask such persons how experience can 
show not only that a thing is but that it 
must be by what authority he the mere 
recorder of the actual occurrences of the 
past pronounces upon all possible cases 
though as yet to be tried hereafter only or 
probably never or descending to par 
ticulars when it is maintained that it is 
from experience alone that we know that 
two straight lines cannot enclose space we 
ask who ever made the trial and how 
and we request to be informed in what way 
he ascertained that the lines with which he 



derived from the senses 

made his experiment were accurately straight 
the fallacy is in this case i conceive too 
palpable to require to be dwelt upon 

a meaning of the word empirical has 
crept into our language lately in conse 
quence of the freedom with which some phi 
losophers treat the kings engush and i fear 
also from the bad translation of some grer 
man writings which it was not wont to 
have as if it were simply equivalent to ex 
perimental whereby we are threatened with 
the loss of a good word for a very important 
idea namely that of quackery or the ob 
servance of rules drawn from a narrow ex 
perience in neglect or defiance of a large 
and true experience in eight instances of 
the use of the word by our best old english 
authors which johnson gives it is inva 
riably associated with this latter meaning 
no fact which is a fact can deserve the 
epithet empirical 

mr whewell would have done well if 
we do not get our knowledge of the first 
principles or as he better expresses it 
the fundamental conceptions of mathema 



 mathematical notions 

tical science from experience to inform us 
whence or how we do get them as he has 
not supplied that information his reader 
may be apt to pause and if he be a friend 
of that wise and cautious old gentleman 
hight experience he will not easily allow 
the laugh to be turned against him just 
so mr dugald stewart in his remarks upon 
demonstrative reasoning says it is by no 
means sufficient to account for the essential 
distinction which every person must perceive 
between the irresistible cogency of a mathe 
matical demonstration and that of any other 
process of reasoning that in mathema 
tics there is no such thing as an ambiguous 
word but mr stewart does not help his 
reader to account for it in any other way 
thus he first plunders him of an allsufficient 
principle and then leaves him in the dark 
nay he lays it down as his own principle 
that it is the peculiarity of mathematics to 
reason from definition as if keeping to him 
self what he would not allow to another 

 see on this the passage of du hamels quoted by 
the edinburgh reviewer p 



derived from the senses 

it appears to me very reasonable to ask 
 what but experience can show not only 
that a thing is but that it must e — a 
very general and perhaps useless proposition 
— experientia docet and let every man be 
careful how he limits the extent and value of 
her lessons as we did not make our own 
senses nor the external world we are 
supplied by the constitution of our frame 
with certain conceptions which are natural 
to and inseparable from that frame we 
make words or signs for our conceptions 
and by use the words become indissolubly 
associated with those conceptions and so 
long as we make those signs or words stand 
for those certain conceptions so long in 
fact as being signs they have signification 
we act the part of rational and consistent 
beings if a plain man be asked how he 
knows that two straight lines cannot enclose 
space he may in his turn ask the questioner 
whether he ever knew it otherwise and so 
may force him to own that constant experi 
ence taught him that truth that nature had 
furnished him with the notions of a une and 



 experience 

of straightness and the words belonging to 
those notions that his mathematical studies 
had built upon that experience and that in 
regard to ascertaining that any given lines be 
fore him were accurately straight it was clear 
that the straighter they were in any conceiv 
able meaning of the term straight the less 
likely they were to enclose a space k i 
were asked how i know that in any right 
angled triangle the square which is described 
upon the side subtending the right angle is 
equal to the squares described upon the sides 
which contain the right angle my first an 
swer might be that i knew it by studying 
the th of the first book of euchd but the 
study of eucud forms a small part of my ex 
perience which includes all my observations 
and reflections upon the contents of eucud 
and all the conceptions gathered from the 
study of the relations traced and traceable be 
tween the various figures therein the subject 
of meditation in short experience uke na 
ture is a word of such very comprehensive im 
port as containing within itself so completely 
the sources of knowledge and instruction that 



beddoes on demonstration 

whatever does not fall within the houndaries 
of that wide domain can be nothing short 
of immediate inspiration if a friend asks 
me to show him that the thing must be 
so or in other words to furnish him with 
euclids proof or a mathematical proof of 
the truth of that th proposition that is 
another question and then i should recal 
the steps of the demonstration and what 
demonstration is is the matter into which we 
are now inquiring 

there is a wellknown work by dr beddoes 
on the nature of demonstrative evidence 
wliich contains many useful observations on 
the connexion between language and thought 
in which he endeavours to show that euchds 
reasoning begins from experiment and pro 
ceeds by experiments there is an awkward 

 of course it would be absurd to contend that the 
truths and demonstrations of geometry are lessons of 
mere experience in a sense strictly analogous to that in 
which we apply the term to the observations and details 
of our ordinary daily existence and sensation we are 
discussing solely the origin of the fundamental concep 
tions on which mathematical reasoning rests — the data 
from which it starts

ness in the phrase mental experiments which 
the poctor uses and which might have been 
avoided by a different mode of stating his 
argument or view and which seems to be 
this — that the fundamental notions or con 
ceptions from which mathematical reasoning 
starts and to which it appeals are as much 
the result of experience and rest as much 
upon the evidence of the senses and the 
natural meaning of our own words in con 
nexion with that evidence as the funda 
mentals of any physical science whatsoever 
and he instances particularly the axioms as 
they are called that two straight lines 
cannot enclose a space and the whole is 
greater than its part 

in a review of a treatise of lesues on 
mathematics attributed to professor play 
fair in the twentieth volume of the edin 
burgh review there are some remarks 
upon this work of dr beddoes which 
coming from professor playfair are entitled 
to particular consideration playfair sug 
gests that beddoes was no great mathe 
matician but with submission this is no 



hartley on propositions 

answer to beddoes argument and rather 
too near an approach to the common tac 
tics of controversial writing in which the 
readers attention is diverted from the ques 
tion and the pursuit of truth by some in 
sinuation against the character or abiuties of 
an adversary play fair tells us that geome 
trical reasoning is a process purely intellec 
tual and resting ultimately on truths which 
the mind intuitively perceives are we then 
to rest here without going further — without 
venturing to ask what are truths intuitively 
perceived in what sense this is true the 
present observations are meant to illustrate 
and if i am not very much deceived will 
sufficiently or in a great measure help the 
reader to understand meantime i beg to 
call his attention to a remarkable and just 
sentence of hartleys in his invaluable and 
profound chapters on words and the idea 
associated with them and on propositions 
and the nature of assent rational 
assent to any proposition may be defined 
a readiness to affirm it to be true proceeding 
from a close association of the ideas sug 



 force of habit 

gested by the proposition with the idea or 
internal feeling belonging to the word truth or 
of the terms of the proposition with the word 
truth and then follow some observations 
on geometrical and mathematical reasoning 
which are as clear beautiful and unanswer 
able as any observations upon abstract truths 
within the circle of human science and phi 
losophy 

but fourthly whencesoever we get the 
notions or conceptions with which we are 
concerned in mathematical reasoning i 
think it must be admitted that habit i e 
the constant recurrence of the same simple 
ideas of numiber and figure and the constant 
association of the same terms with the same 
ideas has much to do with that feeling of 
certainty and satisfaction that readiness and 
confidence of assent which we recognise in 
connexion with the processes of arithmetic 
algebra and geometr 

how much there is in habit may be easily 
and irresistibly shown thus we say that 
 and make and the three angles of 
a triangle are equal to two right angles 



in mathematical reasoning 

and we feel the truth as we pronounce 
the words but if we take higher numbers 
and more advanced propositions — if we say 
that nine thousand six hundred and seventy 
three times seventythree thousand 
six hundred and nine make 
 or upwards of seven hundred 
and twelve millions or if wfe take some of 
the propositions relating to proportion in the 
fifth book or go on to the more abstruse calcu 
lations in algebra trigonometry and fluxions 
will our assent be so ready who will 
assert it and why — because we are not in 
the habit of attending to high numbers and 
advanced propositions doubt ignorance 
and difficulty attach themselves to our terms 
he who has just risen from calculations or the 
study of mathematics will feel a confidence in 
terms and propositions which others do not 
a ready accountant casts up with a glance or 
two a long column of accounts he perceives 
the relation of each item to the whole 
amount in a space of time that appears incre 
dibly short to one wholly unaccustomed to 
such work those who are in the habit of 



 fewness of terms and premises 

estimating the number of persons in a 
crowded room or assembly can tell by 
looking at the mass with reference to the 
space occupied how many may be present 
with much more correctness than another 
who should try for the first time to count the 
heads so the bare statement of a pro 
position and a glance at the diagram will 
enable the quick mathematician to under 
stand the whole demonstration and to re 
peat the various steps of the process faith 
fully to another while he who is slow at 
combining the ideas of figure notwithstand 
ing ever so careful reading of the proof will 
be still at a loss to perceive its coeency and 
wiu pass from the words to the figure and 
the figure to the words without being a 
whit the wiser or having any distinct idea of 
what he is about or where he is present to 
the mind the elaborate paper of sir w

in algebraic studies monstrum horrendum

that of the learned reader and to his own 
eye it appears as the harmonious and beau 
tiful arrangement of simple elements each 
having its due pljice and force combining to 
one noble important and useful result 

further in geometrical and mathematical 
reasoning the premises are few the terms 
employed are few and the mind is only en 
gaged in tracing the relations of a few dis 
tinct simple ideas which are fixed by sen 
sible impressions the whole vocabulary of 
eucud may be comprised in a couple of 
pages each book turns upon a few defi 
nitions the whole volume is filled with 
repetitions of the same terms with appeals 
to the same brief premises attention is 
more or less frequently recalled to each pro 
position as it passes in review and which 
ranks when proved among the foregone 
premises the notations of algebra are 
comparatively few the letters which stand 
for unknown quantities derive their meaning 
solely from connexion with and relation to 
the known quantities at least in their first 



 sameness of terms 

use and at last from their relation to each 
other in consequence of an extended mean 
ing in the symbols with which meaning by 
habitual contemplation the mind becomes 
familiar among the figures of arithmetic 
there are but nine units after ten you begin 
with new relations of the first nine hun 
dreds are combinations of tens thousands of 
hundreds and so on and with regard to 
the higher numbers we can always make 
clear their value to the senses for though 
we could form not the least notion how many 
men there might be in a field of battle or 
how many grains of corn in a sack by 
looking at them in the mass yet divide 
them into companies of thousands of hun 
dreds and tens and by this arrangement the 
mind gains a clear and practical sense of the 
number it is doubtless by understanding the 
number and character and the due arrange 
ment of his forces that a commanderinchief 
is enabled to dispose of them to the best ad 
vantage and form the order of battle 

our ideas of number and figure are what 
locke calls distinct simple modes and 
however varied in combination or relations 



and simplicity of ideas 

the same signs or terms are invariably con 
nected with the same conformations of figure 
and the same relations of number put 
down a threesided figure in lines or any 
four or more of the arabic nimxerals in a 
line as and every human being using 
the english language would express the 
relation in the same terms — would pro 
nounce the one a triangle and read the other 
four thousand five hundred and sixtyfive 

 the idea of two is as distinct from that 
of one says locke b ii chap xiii as 
blueness from heat or either of them from 
any number and yet it is made up only of 
that simple idea of an unit repeated and 
repetitions of this kind joined together 
make those distinct simple modes of a dozen 
a gross a miluon 

thus also he speaks concerning figure 
 the mind having a power to repeat 
the idea of any length directly stretched out 
and join it to another in the same direction 
which is to double the length of that straight 
line or else join another with what inclina 
tion it thinks fit and so make what sort of 



 fewness of terms 

angle it pleases and being able also to 
shorten any line it imagines by taking from 
it onehalf or onefourth or what part it 
pleases without being able to come to an 
end of any such division it can make an 
angle of any bigness so also the lines that 
are its sides of any length it pleases which 
joining again to other lines of different 
lengths and at different angles till it has 
wholly enclosed any space it is evident that 
it can multiply figures both in their shape 
and capacity in infinitum all which are but 
so many difierent simple modes of space 

there does not appear any advantage but 
the contrary in the use of the term modcy 
and alternating it with idea as locke 
does in this and in other parts of his essay 
but whether ideas or modes it is evident 
they are simple because they do not admit 
of being resolved into other ideas or notions 
still simpler but result at once from uni 
formity in the structure and impressions of 
the senses which uniformity lays the foun 
dation for language and reasoning 

the simplicity and uniformity of the sen 



in mathematical reasoning 

sible impressions of space or figure and 
number and the comparative fewness of the 
terms or symbols in use in mathematical 
reasoning constantly associated with the 
same impressions — terms or symbols which 
are in fact human contrivances for conveying 
those impressions from one mind to another 
— these things are to be borne in mind and 
duly weighed in estimating the nature of 
demonstrative evidence nor let any man 
despise mathematical studies or think them 
a mere ringing of changes upon the same set 
of bells because the terms employed are 
few and the original simple ideas few 
otherwise let him despise the english lan 
guage or language in general because there 
are only twentysix letters in the alphabet 
for what endless varieties of thought — what 
worlds of wisdom — what vast structures of 
science are these twentysix letters allsufli 
cient and what would human ufe be with 
out them 

but we have not yet analysed the nature 
of mathematical reasoning we have said 
that mathematical reasoning sets out from 



 final characteristic 

definitions that these definitions settle the 
meaning of terms that these terms are the 
signs of our ideas of figure and quantity of 
numbers and magnitudes that these ideas 
are among the simplest clearest with which 
our minds and senses are conversant that 
the terms in use and the simple ideas 
to which they are uniformly appropriated 
are comparatively few that the constancy 
of connexion between the terms and ideas 
that is habit has much to do with that 
feeling of assent and conviction to which the 
reasoning gives rise by which the processes 
are accompanied as any one must perceive 
who begins to instruct children in arithmetic 
or in geometry 

but further fifthly and lastly the demon 
strative quality of mathematical reasoning 
consists essentially in this — the perception 
of the agreement or disagreement of certain 
ideas and certain terms with other inter 
mediate ideas and terms which are used as 
a measure or test of truth such ideas and 
terms having been previously selected by the 
mind for a measure or test in other words 



of demonstration 

a means or standard of comparison to 
demonstrate is to show that a certain propo 
sition not granted to be true is true by virtue 
of some premise previously admitted or as 
sumed as a criterion of truth or by virtue of 
some other truth previously demonstrated in 
other words to demonstrate is to discover 
and trace further and new relations amongst 
our ideas by comparing them one with an 
other which new relations will be of deter 
minate and constant character in proportion 
as the intermediate ideas which are used as a 
means of comparison as a measure are 
themselves of distinct and constant character 
and value or again it is to show that 
ideas not clearly perceived to harmonize or 
agree do harmonize by comparison with 
other ideas whose agreement is clearly per 
ceived thus in the first proposition of 
eucud the sides of a given triangle are 
proved to be equal when they are all shown 
to belong to the class of lines which radiate 

 the reader may consult the papers on mathematics 
by mr de morgan who gives this just account of de 
monstration 



 final characteristic 

from the centre to the circumference of the 
same circle or of equal circles of which 
class of lines equality is previously premised 
in the fifteenth definition 

this essential quality of demonstrative 
reasoning is thus distinctly laid down by the 
great master locke book iv c ii — 

 the next degree of knowledge is where 
the mind perceives the agreement or dis 
agreement of any ideas but not immediately 
though wherever the mind perceives the 
agreement or disagreement of any of its ideas 
there be certain knowledge yet it does not 
always happen that the mind sees that 
agreement or disagreement which there is 
between them even where it is discoverable 
and in that case remains in ignorance at 
most gets no farther than a probable con 
jecture the reason why the mind cannot 
always perceive presently the agreement or 
disagreement between two ideas is because 
those ideas concerning whose agreement or 
disagreement the inquiry is made cannot by 
the mind be so put together as to shew it 
in this case then when the mind cannot so 



of demonstration 

bring its ideas together as by their imme 
diate comparison and as it were juxta 
position and application one to another to 
perceive their agreement or disagreement it 
is fain by the intervention of other ideas 
one or more as it happens to discover the 
agreement or disagreement which it searches 
and this is what we call reasoning 

again § — 

 tliose intervening ideas which serve to 
show the agreement of any two others are 
called proofs and where the agreement and 
disagreement is by this means plainly and 
clearly perceived it is called demonstration 

again — 

 in every step reason makes in demon 
strative knowledge there is an intuitive 
knowledge of that agreement or disagreement 
it seeks with the next intermediate idea 
which it uses as a proof for if it were not so 
that yet would need a proof since without 
the perception of such agreement or dis 
agreement there is no knowledge if it be 
perceived by itself it is intuitive knowledge 
if it cannot be perceived by itself there is 



 final characteristic 

need of some intervening idea as a common 
measure to show their agreement or disagree 
ment so that to make a thing a 
demonstration it is necessary to perceive 
the immediate agreement of the intervening 
ideas whereby the agreement or disagree 
ment of the two ideas under examination 
whereof the one is always the first and the 
other the last in the account is found 

it is not without reason that locke dwells 
upon this and he repeats himself in ch xv 
of the fourth book on probability which 
the reader may consult 

in this analvsis of demonstrative or mathe 
matical reasoning it is finally to be observed 
that the definitions are used as the primary 
common measures or tests they are the 
original ideas or settled notions by means of 
which the relations of other ideas one with 
another are traced and the agreement or 
disagreement ascertained and settled and 
by which the new relations so ascertained 
become themselves of determinate and con 
stant character each book begins with its 
necessary definitions and each proposition 



of demonstrative reasoning 

when settled becomes itself a premise or test 
by help of which further relations are traced 
and new agreements or disagreements as 
certained and fixed the mind is con 
tinually reverting to its original simple no 
tions builds carefully upon them and not only 
has a power to retrace but is very frequently 
employed in carefully retracing every step 
of its progress thus we return to the point 
from which we set out that definition is the 
basis of mathematical reasoning and gives 
it its pecuuarly fixed clear and cer 
tain character 

the reader who may doubt whether 
this be a correct or perfect analysis of 
mathematical or demonstrative reasoning 
is requested by a careful examination of 
mathematical works to supply the deficiency 
let him apply it to the most simple or the 
most abstruse propositions and demonstra 
tions and say what essential quality of such 
reasoning has been omitted

 stewart contrasted 



section 

having now analysed with all the com 
pleteness in our power the nature of de 
monstrative reasoning we are prepared for 
the inquiry whether it differs from other 
reasoning or reasoning in general in any 
respects or particulars whatsoever and 
if it do not so differ we are then prepared 
for the important inquiry how the cogency 
and certainty of mathematical science can be 
appued to and obtained in moral poutical 
metaphysical and religious subjects 

now the tendency and almost the object 
of mr dugald stewarts chapters on mathe 
matical demonstration and on the aristo 
telian logic is to draw a broad une of dis 
tinction between mathematical reasoning 
mathematical evidence and other kinds of 
reasoning other kinds of evidence ma 
thematical definitions he says vol ii 
p to are of a nature essentially dif 
ferent from the definitions employed in any 



with whately 

of the other sciences again p he 
speaks of the essential distinction which 
every person must perceive between the irre 
sistible cogency of a mathematical demon 
stration and that of any other process of 
reasoning he repeats this idea in various 
places i need only refer to p 
where he says if the account which has 
been given of the nature of demonstrative 
evidence be admitted the province over 
which it extends must be limited almost en 
tirely to the objects of pure mathematics 

but what says dr whately in his ele 
ments of logic 

 one of the chief impediments to the attain 
ment of a just view of the nature and objects of 
logic is the not fully understanding or not suffi 
ciently keeping in mind the sameness of the 
reasoning process in all cases if as the ordinary 
mode of speaking would seem to indicate mathe 
matical reasoning and theological and meta 
physical and pohtical c were essentially differ 
ent from each other l e different kinds of reason 
ing it would follow that supposing there could 
be at all any such science as we have described 
logic there must be so many different species 
or at least different branches of logic and such 

d

is perhaps the most prevaihng notion — srd ed 
p 

again p he says — 

 supposing it to have been perceived that the 
operation of reasoning is in all cases the same the 
analysis of that operation could not fail to strike 
the mind as an interesting matter of inquiry 

and thus p — 

 whatever the subject matter of an argument 
may be the reasoning itself considered by itself 
is in every case the same process and if the 
writers against logic had kept this in mind they 
would have been cautious of expressing their con 
tempt of what they call svllogistic reasoning 
which is in truth au reasoning 



let us contrast with this — for there is 
nothing more instructive than bringing into 
juxtaposition the different aspects in which 
these recondite matters are presented to our 
attention — let us contrast with this the 
barely intelligible lqnguage of the edinburgh 
reviewer p 

 now as all matter is either necessary or con 
tingent a distinction which may be here roughly 
assumed to coincide with mathematical or non

mathematical we have thus besides a theoretic or

the philosophical sciences require and cultivate 
has attracted the attention of observers from the 
most ancient times the principle of this con 
trast lies in their different objects in their differ 
ent ends and in the different modes of considering 
their objects 

he speaks also of mathematics as de 
termining dissimilar developments of thought 
from other sciences as not developing the 
higher faculties as dependant on the 
lower imagination 

again p — 

mathematics departing from certain original 
hypotheses and these hypotheses exclusively de 
termining every movement of their procedure and 



 general influence 

the images or vicarious symbols about which 
they are conversant being clear and simple the 
deductions of these sciences are apodictic or 
demonstrative that is the possibiuty of the con 
trary is at every step seen to be excluded in the 
very comprehension of the terms on the other 
hand in philosophy with the exception of the 
science of logic and in our reasonings in general 
such demonstrative certainty is rarely to be at 
tained probable certainty l e where we are never 
conscious of the imposisibiuty of the contrary is all 
that can be compassed and this also not being 
internally evolved from any fundamental data 
must be sought for collected and applied from 
without 

 from this general contrast it will be seen how 
an excessive study of the mathematical sciences 
not only does not prepare but absolutely incapaci 
tates the mind for those intellectual energies which 
philosophy and life require we are thus dis 
qualified for observation either internal or external 
for abstraction and generalization and for common 
reasoning 

now common reasoning we conceive to be 
very bad reasoning such reasoning as fails 
to satisfy the man who is seeking for clear 
and exact views who fears to be misled by 
words and who remembers that fine phrase 
ology teaches nothing it may be observed 



of mathematical studies 

here that whatever force or justness there is 
in the reviewers general course of observation 
it all lies in the word excessive — an ex 
cessive study of the mathematical sciences 
and it is perfectly obvious that he who is con 
versant only with mathematical notions and 
mathematical processes may be ignorant of 
many other objects of human attention 
which come nearer home to the business and 
bosoms the pleasures and pains of mankind 
at large he who is always dwelling in 
circles and squares ellipses and parabolas 
differentials and integrals may have a pro 
portionally confined range of thought he 
will not understand the feelings and thoughts 
of other men and he may fancy from the 
habitual association of his ideas or from his 
determining everything in the same way that 
he can ascertain the precise quantity of en 
joyment which a company of aldermen de 
rive from eating and drinking by means of 
the differential or integral calculus and de 
termine the relative merits of homer and 
virgil by the rule and compasses but what 
then shall mathematical studies not be 



 general influence 

valued as an essential part of the training of the 
youthful mind is mr whewells sentiment 
invalidated that they are the best practical ex 
emplification and exercise of logic if there 
be one mode of studying mathematics better 
than another shall not a mathematical pro 
fessor discuss this question and endeavour 
to settle which is best how many sciences 
are there which require for their pursuit 
comprehension and enjoyment a thorough 
knowledge of the higher branches of mathe 
matics such as astronomy optics dynamics 
and all those which go under the name of the 
mixed sciences who would undervalue 
the highest mathematical attainment when 
applied to these branches of science and 
not rather regret when he sees the mathe 
matician soaring in the clouds and lost in 
the dim distance of algebraic formulae his 
inability to follow non omnes possumus 
omnia but we can all enjoy and apply 
those practical and simple conclusions for 
the estabushment of which the most pro 
found mathematical investigations are oft 
times necessary 



of mathematical studies 

if the question be what degree of time 
and attention should be given up to mathe 
matical studies in a thoroughly comprehen 
sive course of academic education or how 
far exclusive encouragement should be given 
to high mathematical attainment in an uni 
versity which the reviewer has in part 
raised and discussed this may be settled 
without depreciating the importance and 
value of mathematics for the discipline of 
the youthful mind you have then to take 
into account the great and general purposes 
of education the whole constitution of the 
human mind the condition and wants of 
society at large the fitness of an individual 
for the particular station which he is de 
signed to occupy and the kind of knowledge 
which his meditated profession may re 
quire 

it is curious to contrast the reviewers 
statement of the injurious influence of 
mathematical science in disqualifying for ob 
servation either internal or external for 
abstraction and generalization with the in 
tellectual character of sir isaac newton 

d 



 herschels character 

drawn by sir john herschel in his treatise 
on the study of natural philosophy p 

 his wonderful combination of mathematical 
skill with physical research enabled him to invent 
at pleasure new and unheardof methods of in 
vestigating the effects of those causes which his 
clear and penetrating mind detected in operation 
whatever department of science he touched he 
may be said to have formed afresh ascending by 
a series of closecompacted inductive arguments 
to the highest axioms of dynamical science he 
succeeded in applying them to the complete ex 
planation of all the great astronomical phenomena 
and many of the minuter and more enigmatical 
ones in doing this he had every thing to create 
the mathematics of his age proved totally inade 
quate to grapple with the numerous difficulties 
which were to be overcome of the optical 
discoveries of newton we have already spoken 
and if the magnitude of the objects of his astrono 
mical discoveries excite our admiration of the 
mental powers which could so famiuarly grasp 
them the minuteness of the researches into which 
he there set the first example of entering is no less 
calculated to produce a corresponding impression 
whichever way we turn our view we find our 
selves compelled to bow before his genius and to 
assign to the name of newton a place in our 
veneration which belongs to no other in the an 
nals of science his era marks the accomphshed 



of sir isaac newton 

maturity of the human reason as applied to such 
objects every thing which went before might 
be more properly compared to the first imperfect 
attempts of childhood or the essays of inexpert 
though promising adolescence whatever has 
been since performed however great in itself and 
worthy of so splendid and auspicious a beginning 
has never in point of intellectual effort surpassed 
that astonishing one which produced the prin 
cipia 

i refer to this treatise with a strong feeling 
of interest because it is evident from the 
observations on nomenclature and on science 
generally that herschels clear english 
mind duly estimates the importance of 
settled terms with settled meanings and 
while he dwells on the necessity of having 
exact and uniform standards of measure 
ment and value his reader is set upon the 
inquiry into the nature and purposes of 
measures or tests he who can perceive the 
importance of a proper use of words in 
physical science must feel that importance 
also in metaphysical without it in fact 
we can have nothing worthy of the name of 
science sir john herschel would probably 



 logic defined 

smile at the idea of mathematical science 
disqualifying for generalization and abstrac 
tion or any useful exercise of mind 

i have indulged in these references to 
dugald stewart dr whately the edin 
burgh reviewer and sir john herschel 
with a view to place before the reader in an 
easy manner the different lights in which the 
same objects or objects closely allied in 
nature and character are presented to our 
attention and the necessity of close and 
cautious investigation 

now bearing in mind the foregone analysis 
of geometrical or demonstrative reasoning 
in order to perceive its connexion with logic 
it is necessary to understand what logic is 
is dr whately right or wrong when he says 
the reasoning process is the same in all cases 
if he is right of course it follows that 
mathematical or geometrical reasoning is 
but one illustration or practical application 
of logic 

i am unable to attach any other consistent 
meaning to the term logic than that it is an 
other word — the greek word — for reasoning 



logic defined 

as a science it investigates the principles of 
reasoning or analyses and determines the 
process of the mind in reasoning as an art 
it is the practical appucation or exemphfica 
tion of the rules so deduced on this 
point nothing can be clearer and more satis 
factory than dr whatelys observations in 
his preface and throughout his treatise 

yet notwithstanding this clearness and 
notwithstanding dr whatelys correction of 
the error of watts in considering logic as hhe 
right use of reason a method of invigo 
rating and properly directing all the powers 
of the mind a writer on logic in the edition 
of the encyclopsedia britannica now in the 
course of pubucation says logic may be 
defined as the science of the laws of thought 
considered as thought this is the central 
notion towards which the various views of 
the science from aristotle downwards gravi 
tate it is the one definition in which others 
apparently the most opposite find their com 
plement and reconcihation then by way 
of elucidating this definition the writer 
whom from his use of the term laws and the 



 logic as treated 

epithets contingent necessary universal di 
rigible and so on i could suspect to be the 
edinburgh reviewer already alluded to pro 
ceeds to tell us first that logic is conversant 
about thought in the second place about 
thought considered as thought and in the 
third place it is the science of the laws of 
thought because it is conversant about the 
universal and necessary in thought 

these are the remarks of a writer who 
comments on the erroneous definition of 
logic in an article which the editor of the 
encyclopaedia has reprinted an article 
which tells us that logic is the art of 
properly conducting reason in the knowledge 
of things whether for instructing ourselves 
or others or it may be defined the science 
of human thought inasmuch as it traces the 
progress of knowledge and that its business 
is to evolve the laws of human thought and 
the proper manner of conducting the reason 
in order to the attainment of truth and 
knowledge and while the writer comments 
on this article he further teus us that from 
aristotle downwards the purity of the science 



by the encyclopaedia britannica 

has been contaminated by foreign infusions 
he speaks of dr whatelys elements 
as vague and vacillating in its views its 
doctrines neither being developed from the 
primary laws of thought nor combined to 
gether as the essential parts of one necessary 
whole in short being desirous to make 
something more of a subject than has ever 
yet been made of it and to see further 
into things than any one else has seen he 
plunges into darkness and a wood of words 

• • hunc tegit omnis 

lucus et obscuris claudunt convallibus umbrae 

or hke many of his brethren he is so 
blinded by the mists of his own land that he 
cannot enjoy the cheerful sun and daylight 
loved by the children of the south and 
when he is pleased to consider thought as 
thought he forgets that no one in his senses 
was likely to mistake it for cakes and ale 
indeed but for the eminence to which the 
encyclopaedia britannica aspires and is in 
part deservedly raised as an authority in the 
sciences he might be benevolently left to the 
condition and neglect in which the new 



 logic as treated 

poorlaw leaves those who will not help 
themselves when they can 

seriously however when we talk of the 
science of the laws of thought do we know 
what we are talking about with confidence 
i answer no the whole subject of meta 
physics the whole state of our knowledge 
and language on the nature qualities powers 
and affections of the human understanding 
as may be inferred from the article meta 
physics in this very encyclopaedia is such 
that to talk of the laws of thought to speak 
of primary laws which implies secondary 
and universal and necessary which implies 
particular and contingent is to talk of no 
body knows what what has logic to do 
with the laws by which thoughts come and 
go in the mind of a child or of a maniac for 
i suppose a maniac has thoughts and if so 
is subject to laws of thought true enough 
all logic supposes a thinking mind but so 
does every other science so do carpentry and 
masonry and wherever we have thinking 
minds there we have minds subject no 
doubt to what we are pleased to call laws 



by the encyclopiedia britannica 

but to set the mind hunting after the gene 
ral laws of thought under pretence of study 
ing logic is to entrap the student into un 
lookedfor difficulties to leave aristotle 
utterly in the lurch to give us our labour 
for our pains and to bring us after a 
fatiguing hunt like spensers good knight 
only to the cave of despair if logic be the 
science of the laws of thought what is the 
province of mental philosophy i do not 
question that the one touches closely the 
province of the other but science used for 
merly to consist in nicely distinguishing 
rather than confounding the things that dif 
fer howsoever minute that difference at the 
risk of appearing merely to reprint what my 
reader may find elsewhere but what cannot 
be too strongly impressed upon the mind 
i must use the words of dr whately and 
say that the attempt to comprehend so 
wide a field is no extension of science but a 
mere verbal generalization which leads only 
to vague and barren declamation in every 
pursuit the more precise and definite our 



 nature of reasoning 

object the more likely we are to attain some 
valuable result 

without further discussion i must assume 
that logic is but another word for reasoning 
and the object of it as a science is to ascer 
tain the process of the mind to which we 
specially give that name now we have 
analysed the nature of mathematical reason 
ing or in other words we have examined 
the process of the mind in that reasoning 
can we then abstract what is pecuuar to 
the mathematics and talk of reasoning in 
general without regard to any particulars 
may we not ask what is meant by reasoning 
as a term standing alone is there one 
determinate process of mind to which the 
term reasoning is peculiarly and alone appro 
priate 

nature and the senses give me the idea of 
a man and of a horse i suppose the body 
and legs of a horse joined to the breast and 
head of a man and call that supposition or 
conception by the name of a centaur doing 
this would you say i reason no i only 



examined 

imagine and give a name to the object of 
my imagination which are indeed important 
elements of the reasoning powers but when 
i say all animals have feeling no vegetable 
has feeling therefore no vegetable is an 
animal you would say i reason although 
from the very obviousness of the words and 
from their arrangement and the smallness 
of the effort of which we are conscious in 
following that arrangement the portion of 
reason concerned if we could divide reason 
into measureable portions is almost too in 
significant to be worthy of the name but 
if this be reasoning what have we 

first of all words or audible sounds asso 
ciated with many sensible impressions or 
objects — animals 

secondly these objects classified and 
viewed in a common relation or under the 
affirmation — having feeungs 

and thirdly other objects viewed under 
a different relation having no feeung there 
fore excluded from this class no vegetables 
animals or vegetables no animals 

in this who can detect any thing but the 



 whatelys logic 

results or lessons of human experience or 
registered observation classified and clothed 
in appropriate language — that which is 
affirmed of one being denied of the other 
class — language being to us the means 
and very element of thought at least of 
thought conveyed from one mind to an 
other and hence the beauty of the greek 
word koyo which is at once verbum and 
ratio — the audible sound and mental ap 
prehension 

i prefer however taking a work of au 
thority uke dr whatelys as a guide for the 
course of thought which it appears most 
useful and important to pursue in ana 
lysing the operation of the mind in reason 
ing dr whately says it will be found 
that every conclusion is deduced in reahty 
from two other propositions thence called 
premises he contends there must be two 
propositions and says section third of a 
valid argument it is impossible for any 
one who admits both premises to avoid ad 
mitting the conclusion then after giving 
an example of the true syllogism he says 



considered 

there is this maxim resulting from it that 
whatever is predicated universally of any 
class of things may be predicated in like 
manner of any thing comprehended in that 
class — the celebrated principle called the 
dictum de omni et nullo of aristotle after 
some observations on the substitution of 
letters and symbols for the terms of the 
syllogism on apparent arguments on the 
importance of finding a proper middle 
term on generalization and abstraction 
he winds up the analysis with the remark 
 that it consists in referring the term we 
are speaking of to some class viz a mid 
dle term which term again is referred 
to or excluded from as the case may be 
another class viz the term which we wish 
to affirm or deny of the subject of the 
conclusion 

with a very strong sense of the value 
of dr whatelys elements — of the cor 
rectness and usefulness of the principles and 
views therein detailed — it may be permit 
ted me to observe that even that work is 
in some degree deficient in the rigid 



 whatelys logic 

propriety of language which the subject 
demanded and which might easily have been 
given to it the analytical outline of logic 
can scarcely be regarded as a successful and 
complete elucidation of the science dr 
whately himself calls it an imperfect and 
irregular sketch 

for as the analytical outune and the syn 
thetical compendium appear in juxtaposi 
tion the reader naturally expects that they 
should answer exactly the one to the other 
the analysis being the resolution of the whole 
into the parts or if the reader like it 
better the tracing of given effects to the 
causes from which they spring — the syn 
thesis — the enumeration of the several 
parts which combine to make the whole or 
the advance from the cause to the varied 
effects or consequences but this corre 
spondence is by no means so clear as it 
might have been — as it ought to be for in 
stance having in the analysis stated that 
the operation of reasoning is in all the cases 
the same p fifth edition and that in 
every instance in which we reason a certain 



considered 

process takes place in the mind which is 
one and the same in all cases dr whately 
opens the compendium by saying there 
are three operations or states of the mind 
which are immediately concerned in argu 
ment again after having in the analysis 
described the process in reasoning as the 
deduction of a conclusion from two other 
propositions thence called premises in the 
compendium he says resisoning is the 
act of proceeding from one judgement to an 
other founded upon that one or the result 
of it these discrepancies may be more 
apparent than real they may be of slight 
consequence but the careful reader is to a 
certain degree distracted and as the great 
object of the study of logic is to clear and 
to brace the mind — as it is but the athletics 
and gymnastics of the reasoning faculties — 
as clearness and strength are entirely depend 
ant on perfect precision in the use of terms 
— so the teacher of logic should avoid a ver 
bal discrepancy as fatal to his science as the 
man under training should avoid diluents 
and laxatives of every kind 



 analysis and synthesis 

i am aware that some may think i have 
drawn too strictly the paralleusm between 
the analytical and synthetical modes but 
after a careful perusal of mr dugald 
stewarts remarks upon the use of these 
terms in ancient and modern philosophy 
showing that authority may be pleaded for 
using them in an exactly opposite and mu 
tually convertible sense and that he himself 
is at a loss to give them precise meaning — 
sometimes confuting in the notes what he lays 
down in the text — after reading also what 
maclaurin says about these modes in his ac 
count of sir i newtons discoveries — i cannot 
help considering them in a very simple and 
obvious light as different or opposite modes 
of going over the same or a precisely similar 
path according to the simile of condillac 
one being up and the other down the hill 
only instead of saying with condillac that 
as the two methods are contrary to one an 
other if the one be good the other must be 
bad i rather say both may be good accord 
ing to the position and view which we as 
sume and the walk which for the time we 



analysis of arguments 

please to take dr whately at any rate 
cannot object to a rigid parallelism since in 
his introduction he uses the words as they 
are used in chemistry and by synthesis he 
appears to understand the enumeration of ele 
mentary substances thence proceeding on 
wards to simple combinations or more com 
plex substances by analysis only resolving 
these last namely the complex substances 
step by step into their simple elements 
he should therefore obviously have begun 
his synthetical compendium with a clear and 
explicit enumeration of those very elements 
into which in his analysis he had resolved 
the science or art under review 

but the first and second sections of the 
third chapter and second book on argu 
ments contain a sufficient analysis of argu 
ments which are reasonings expressed in 
words and with such reasonings chiefly if 
not entirely is logic concerned an 
argument says dr whately is an ex 
pression in which from something laid 
down and granted as true i e the premises 

£ 



 syllogism 

something else i e the conclusion beyond 
this must be admitted to be true as following 
necessarily from the other again a syl 
logism — and let us remember that every just 
argument may be reduced into the form of a 
perfect or pure categorical syllogism which 
is sufficiently obvious to the student of logic 
— a syllogism is an argument so expressed 
that the conclusiveness of it is manifest 
from the mere force of the expression 

i conceive this to be a just and sufficient 
account of syllogistic reasoning taken in 
connexion with what was before said respect 
ing terms by logic the force of all reasoning 
or the correctness of syllogism is shown to 
depend entirely upon the degree of exactness 
and comprehensiveness of meaning in the 
terms employed or what is virtually the 
same thing of distinctness in the things 
signified and the chief purpose or use of 
the study is to call the attention of the mind 
to those forms of expression and to fix those 
forms upon the memory which are always 
essential to strict legitimate and convincing 



syllogism 

inference now the value or correctness of 
a syllogism depends mainly upon one prin 
cipal term called the middle term 

 every syllogism says dr whately 
 has three and only three terms viz the 
middle term and the two terms or ex 
tremes as they are commonly called of 
the conclusion or question the middle 
term called by the older logicians argu 
mentum is that with which each of them is 
separately compared in order to judge of 
their agreement or disagreement again 
he says every argument consists of two 
parts that which is proved and that by 
means of which it is proved and again 
 the axioms or canons by which the vah 
dity of pure syllogisms is to be explained 
are these viz first if two terms agree with 
one and the same third they agree with 
each other secondly if one term agrees 
and another disagrees with one and the same 
third these two disagree with each other 

it is obvious that here we have but dif 
ferent views or statements of substantially 
the same thing namely the use of one 

e 



 syllogism 

term called a middle or third as a means of 
comparison between two other terms in 
other words a reference of two terms to one 
and the same object of comparison used as 
a measure or test of their agreement or dis 
agreement — in short the celebrated dictum 
of aristotle that whatever may be predi 
cated universally of a class of objects may be 
predicated of every individual comprehended 
in it which is analogous to the axiom or 
common notion of equauty that things 
which are equal to the same are equal to one 
another or that the whole is made up of all 
the parts 

a syllogism to meike a homely simile is 
a kind of twopronged fork the middle 
term is the handle which unites the prongs 
and enables us to seize conveniently the ob 
ject of our thought and feed our mental 
appetite with food convenient for it 

eg all horned animals are ruminant 
the ox is a homed animal therefore the ox 
is ruminant supposing the habits of the ox 
in particular unknown or doubtful but the 
circumstance of its possessing horns evident 



syllogism 

you infer that that may be predicated of the 
ox which you have previously predicated of 
the class to which it evidently belongs and 
although the syllogism is evidently of httle 
use in cases of experimental knowledge 
where the vaudity both of the premises and 
the conclusion depends upon one and the 
same process of observation yet is it evi 
dent that the first premise of the above ex 
ample can only be true by involving the 
truth of the conclusion 

homed animals 

 

ruminate the ox 

whatever exhibits marks of design must 
have an inteuigent creator the universe ex 
hibits marks of design therefore the uni 
verse must have an inteuigent creator

creator the universe 

all reasoning is included in the term logic 
mathematics is reasoning upon figure and 
quantity therefore mathematics is a branch 
of logic 



o syllogism 

r n 

reasoning mathematics 

the whole mystery of syllosm consists 
therefore simply in referring the two things 
whose relation you wish to ascertain to some 
common class signified by what is called the 
middle term or regarding the conclusion 
as a truth you wish to demonstrate the 
demonstration consists in referring it to 
some test i e to some more general pro 
position whose truth whose use as a test 
is previously admitted agreed upon or 
assumed 

 my attention was arrested by the vignette attached 
to the originij edition of hobbes leviathan after writing 
the above as cahibiting a similar idea of logic to the 




the connexion between logic and just classification 



syllogism 

in examining the nature of syllogistic rea 
soning it is now evident that you have — 

in the first place something laid down 
granted as true or assumed as necessary for 
the subsequent proceeding of the mind it 
does not affect the truth of this position to 
determine whether you must always have two 
propositions as in a regular syllogism before 
a conclusion can be drawn or whether the 
mind having admitted one judgement or pro 
position be led on from that one to an 
other inevitably following from it suffice it 
that in every argument you must begin with 
something laid down granted or assumed 
in other words you must have some datum 
or data as points from which to start or 
ground on which to rest 

secondly having something laid down 
or granted it is the characteristic of all cor 



proves that hobbes is about right though he meets with 
mr stewarts particular reprobation in sajdng that 
 when a man reasoneth he does nothing else but con 
ceive a sum total from addition of parcels or conceive a 
remainder from subtraction of one sum from an 
other c 



 comparison of logical 

rect or logical reasoning that the conclusion 
necessarily follows from the premises it is 
involved in the premises it is a consequence 
inevitably connected with them an absolute 
necessity is the quauty of all sound reasoning 

how then does logical or common reason 
ing differ from what we call mathematical or 
demonstrative reasoning in both we have 
data from which to start and conclusions 
inevitably resulting involved in the meaning 
of the terms i e in our conception of the 
things signified 

will any man assert that logical reason 
ing is not demonstrative in the mathematical 
sense of the term that is does not con 
vey a feeling of certainty to the mind in the 
justness and necessity of the conclusion for 
my own part i feel no difference in respect 
of absolute certainty having admitted that 
 whatever exhibits marks of design must 
have an intelligent author and that the 
universe exhibits marks of design it appears 
to me as inevitable to admit that there 
fore the universe must have an intelligent 
author as to admit that the three angles of 



and mathematical reasoning 

a triangle are equal to two right angles hav 
ing admitted that the sum of the angles 
on the same side of a straight line at the 
same point is equal to two right angles the 
conclusion is involved in the meaning of the 
terms in the latter case it jrests upon the 
notion of equauty in the former the notion 
of design it must be confessed however 
that the notion of design is not so imme 
diately an idea of sensation to use lockes 
phraseology as that of equality it is an 
idea drawn rather from reflection or what 
we are conscious of when the mind turns in 
ward upon itself in common language two 
things are said to be equal when there are no 
sensible marks of difference between them 
but an object of nature or of art will indicate 
design to an observer very much in propor 
tion to the observers power of appreciating 
the end aimed at and the means employed 
and surely it is impossible to separate the 
idea of design from the perception of means 
and ends 

it is not then in the circumstance of start 
ing from certain data or given principles it 

e 



 comparison of logical 

is not in the necessity of the conclusion as 
resulting inevitably from the data that logical 
or common reasoning and mathematical 
reasoning differ from one another we must 
seek for that difference elsewhere when 
therefore the edinburgh reviewer after 
kant talks of necessary and contingent mat 
ter as distinguishing two sorts of logic one 
of avhich he equals to mathematical reason 
ing the other to general reasoning it is a 
talk without meaning or at least without 
clear and sufficient meaning for in all logic 
as in all mathematics the conclusion is 
equally necessary equally contingent equally 
necessary in the sense of inevitably following 
from or being involved in the data equally 
contingent upon the comprehension or force 
of the terms that is the degree of clearness 
and exactness in the things signified 

but again if in all reasonings you start 
from some data and in all reasonings you 
have necessary conclusions where lies the 
difference between what we call mathema 
tical and common reasoning obviously 
we must seek it in the nature or difference of 



and mathematical reasoning 

the data and here perhaps we shall come 
to see in what sense it is true if in any sense 
it be true that in mathematics you have ne 
cessary in logic contingent matter in ma 
thematics we have as i have shown defini 
tions i e exact terms significant of certain 
clear ideas of figure and quantity and we 
are efmployed in tracing the relations of these 
ideas one with another in all other reason 
ing we have also terms and these terms are 
or ought to be signs of ideas but while 
in mathematical reasoning we are concerned 
with ideas of figure and quantity to say no 
thing of forces and motion with whatever else 
can be viewed and treated mathematically in 
logic we have every variety of term and of 
idea there is no proposition of any kind no 
number of words which can be put together 
so as to form a proposition to whatever sub 
ject it may relate which may not form part 
of a syllogism it is owing to this compre 
hensiveness or vastness of logic in its prac 
tical application that its true nature is so 
little understood in all reasoning in all 
thought as communicated from one mind to 



 comparison of logical 

another we have firstly the terms se 
condly the things signified but the sole 
question is how far the terms are exact and 
the things signified clear 

to put tliis in another light if as we 
have endeavoured to show the essence of 
logic of all arguments or syllogisms consist 
in the reference of two terms to one anh the 
same common term or object of comparison 
used as a measure or test of agreement or dis 
agreement and if as we have also shown the 
essence of mathematical or geometrical rea 
soning consist in the perception of the agree 
ment or disagreement of certain ideas and 
terms by means of other intermediate ideas 
and terms previously admitted as a test it 
remains only to inquire what are the peculiar 
measures or what is the excellence of the 
tests in mathematical reasoning for by 
these it obtains its character of force and 
clearness that is of demonstration 

have you in mathematics better data bet 
ter measures than in other subjects the 
only answer is that in mathematics you are 
conversant with ideas of figure and quantity 



and mathematical reasoning 

and that you have certain welldefined terms 
always associated with the same simple ideas 
or impressions the uniformity in the struc 
ture of the senses and in the sensible impres 
sions made upon them laying the foundation 
for that pecuuar constancy of language and 
consequent clearness of reasoning which we 
recognize in connexion with figures and 
numbers 

it follows therefore that it is not in any 
theories about generalization and abstraction 
it is not in any difference between the higher 
faculties and the common faculties that you 
are to seek for an explanation of the cogency 
of mathematical and the weakness of other 
reasoning it is because your abstraction is 
so comparatively easy and your generahza 
tion so complete and because you have cer 
tain exact terms and symbols used as known 
and admitted measures or criteria of proof 
about the appucation of which there neither 
is nor can be a possibility of doubt that 
mathematical reasoning is so satisfactory 

 perhaps this comparative easiness of the abstraction 
and generalization in the mathematical sciences is the 



 comparison of logical 

if in that reasoning there were the slightest 
ambiguity in terms if an angle were mis 
taken for a chord if a b were mistaken for 
any other line than that intended in the 
geometrical proof the reasoning would be 
vitiated the demonstration lost the link of 
concatenation broken just as in arithmetic 
if you mistook a for a your answer 
would be wrong or in more dignified phrase 
your postulatum would exhibit an erratum 
so in logic if the sense of your terms be 
changed in the premises and conclusion the 
force of the syllogism is destroyed the bolt 
of the stable is drawn and the horse gone 

think not there is no classification and 
wherever classification is there is of course 

main thing intended by the reviewer when he speaks of 
the lower faculties only being employed and developed in 
the study but the word faculties makes sad havoc in 
the writings of some philosophers who wuld lead you 
to suppose man had as many distinct faculties as a cen 
tipede has legs a faculty is simply a power every 
action and every thought may be attributed to a distinct 
faculty for that action and that thought and we may if 
we please talk of a faculty for sitting and a faculty for 
walking but we gain confusion and lose distinctness by 
such phraseology 



and mathematical reasoning 

abstraction and generalization in mathema 
tics for in the very first proposition you 
prove your triangle to be equilatieral when 
the sides are shown to belong to the class of 
lines which radiate from the centre to the 
circumference of the same circle or of equal 
circles of which class of unes you have pre 
mised equality as the characteristic and he 
who should dispute this premise must look 
out for another proof of the first proposition 
than that with which his eucud has furnished 
liim 

it is to be observed particularly that the 
definitions in geometry and i think in all 
the branches of mathematics are classifica 
tions or abstractions of a very simple kind 
in geometry of certain sensible impressions 
derived partly from sight and partly from 
touch thus a line is defined length 
without breadth it has been suggested 
that the words without breadth are unne 
cessary but their use is perhaps expedient 
in order to confine attention to that which is 
exclusively the object of the thought or rea 
soning if any given line before us have 



 comparison of logical 

sensible breadth that breadth forms no part 
of or consideration in the reasoning now 
more or less of what we call length is found 
in all visible and tangible objects there is 
not an object wliich we see or handle that 
has not some outline straight or curved to 
this quauty of objects common to all but 
peculiar to none we give the name line or 
length it is an instance of abstraction sim 
ple and complete and when we have lines 
of a certain kind we give them a correspond 
ing denomination as straight curved waving 
it is not however with lines in this very ge 
neral or abstract character that geometrical 
reasoning has much to do but it is concerned 
with unes in more precise and limited cha 
racter as they are related to each other in 
a certain fixed perceptible or conceivable 
manner for instance as perpendicular or 
inclined as meeting in a point and forming 
angles as parallel or equidistant as forming 
squares circles ellipses parabolas or other 
curves with fixed properties and relations 
hence figures are classed as triangles and 
parallelograms as equilateral and equiangu 



and mathematical reasoning 

lar as pentagons hexagons polygons and 
so on and with regard to all these classes 
of figures or definite arrangements of lines 
the mathematical reasoning is strictly syllo 
gistic as in the fifth proposition of the first 
book the proof of the equality of the angles 
at the base of an isosceles triangle turns upon 
bringing the angles in question within a cer 
tain class viz the class of angles subtended 
by equal bases in triangles which have two 
sides of the one equal to two sides of the 
other of which equality is demonstrated in 
the fourth proposition and let us remember 
that every proposition in euclid is demon 
strated as true not merely of the individual 
diagram before the student but of its class 
of which class the said diagram is in respect 
of the reasoning a perfect and sufficient ex 
ample thus the angles of au triangles are 
equal to two right angles whatever be the 
length of the sides whether they be right 
angled or obtuse whether the lines be black 
or blue whether it be the triangle on the 
paper or a supposed triangle formed by 
lines conceived to meet m the centres of the 



 comparison of logical 

earth the sun and the moon it is the 
simplicity and perfection of the classes the 
accuracy with which every term marks and 
defines the class and the neverfaiung con 
nexion between the terms and the sensi 
ble impressions and the ease and certainty 
with which the sensible impressions lead to 
and support the mathematical conceptions 
and definitions these things help to make 
if they do not as i conceive themselves 
make the proof so cogent and the assent 
so firm in geometry 

the dependence of the reasoning upon a 
clear apprehension of the definition starting 
from it and adhering to it becomes still 
more clear if we look at the subject of pro 
portion upon which mr whewell has made 
some but not very distinct remarks the 
fifth book of euclid which treats of pro 
portion mr de morgan calls in con 
junction with aristotles logic the most in 
disputable treatise that ever was written on 
the other hand lesue in the fourth preli 
minary dissertation to the encyclopaedia 
britannica says that it cannot possibly be

taught the whole difficulty seems clearly 
to lie in the necessity of enlarging the minds 
view of proportion previously and strongly 
associated with numbers i e with arith 
metical proportion to magnitudes whose re 
lation to each other cannot be expressed in 
numbers and this difficulty can only be 
overcome by the assiduous study of such 
magnitudes and of a book or books in 
which such magnitudes and their relations 
are brought before the mind the mind by 
the study of the subject grows to the ap 
prehension of the definition which is a ge 
neral principle or view of a certain mutual 
relation of magnitudes involving the truth of 
the propositions to which it is afterwards ap

section iii 

having now shown that the object of the 
science of logic is to call the attention to 
those fonns of expression which are essential 
to valid arguments in which the conclusion 
is necessarily involved in the premises and 
the mind is led to perceive a connexion or 
relation which it did not before perceive 
between its ideas and terms — that it resolves 
itself very much into just classification 
having also shown that mathematical reason 
ing owes its clearness and cogency to the 
simplicity and clearness of its subject mat 
ter — its abstractions and classifications or 
relations of figures and quantities being 
marked by defined terms which are the 
media of mathematical proof — we have to in 
quire how far other notions besides those of 
figure and quantities are susceptible of exact 
definition and exact language and thereby 
of exact comparison one with another this 
is the sum and substance of the question — 



with general reasoning 

the susceptibility of exact comparison be 
tween our notions of other subjects than 
figure and quantity subjects less connected 
with sensible impressions and in which our 
reasoning cannot be assisted or verified by 
an immediate appeal to the evidence of the 
senses 

i may be as certain and doubtless i am 
that there lived a celebrated orator named 
cicero at rome as that the angles at the base 
of an isosceles triangle are equal to one an 
other but it is evident that the ideas asso 
ciated with the words cicero celebrity ora 
tory rome are of a far more varied and com 
plex character than the ideas associated with 
the terms of the above or any mathematical 
proposition and of a hundred persons who 
will equally readily assent to the historical or 
moral proposition the ideas associated with its 
terms will differ by a thousand modifications 
and varieties here then lies the difficulty 
forms and magnitudes visible to the eye 
and weighed by the hand can be compared 
and their exact difference can be estimated 
and described but who shall compare and 



 language as connected 

estimate the exact difference between two 
tastes and two sounds and how indefinite 
must those terms remain which are not only 
associated with a number of such sensible 
impressions incapable of comparison but 
with trains of sensation and emotion the 
traces of which pass away with the moment 
in which they have birth and which are 
perhaps wholly similar in no two existing 
minds 

it is often said by way of distinguishing 
mathematical science from all other kinds 
of reasoning that the mathematics are hu 
man contrivances for attaining human ends 
and that in the reasoning we are only evolving 
the nature and properties of these contri 
vances thus in numbers we have fractions 
and decimals in algebra equations and roots 
so in the affgdrs of ufe we have invented 
common measures with which to compare 
magnitudes and quantities thus we have 
the foot the yard the pound weight the 
ton the pint the bushel by means of which 
quantities distances and magnitudes are re 
latively ascertained and settled so we have 



with general reasoning 

thermometers barometers and chronometers 
for measuring atmospheric weight heat and 
time these are some of the received mea 
sures or tests for ascertaining and determin 
ing the degrees of difference by which one 
quantity varies from another of whatsoever 
can be measured or tested 

let us however remember that all lan 
guage is a human contrivance for expressing 
human thoughts in all their wide relations 
and variety and although the language which 
we daily use may have and most general 
terms have very different ideas associated 
therewith in different minds yet reasoners 
have a certain power over its use we can 
examine control and the exact reasoner 
always seeks to control by examination and 
reflection the associated ideas it should 
seem indeed that where we have no com 
mon measures or exact standards of compa 
rison we cannot come to any exact conclu 
sions and this must be the case in all ques 
tions of degree in things that cannot be re 
duced to measure where we must be con 
tent to use our comparatives and superlatives 



 language as connected 

indefinitely and satisfy ourselves with the 
old maxim de gustibus non disputandum 
but it is in our power to approach to exact 
ness in mathematical phrase as nearly as we 
please by using weludejined terms associated 
with uniform sensible impressions and by dis 
tinguishing things that differ in kind if not 
in degree we may scrupulously avoid un 
necessary changes of terms when the subject 
matter of our reasoning is the same leave 
nothing to be understood which it is possible 
to express and beware of using relatives 
and pronouns to which there is no clear or 
certain antecedent 

it is also often said by way of further dis 
tinguishing the metaphysical sciences from 
the mathematical that the latter turns upon 
human abstractions or hypotheses and you 
begin with definitions whilst the former 
turns upon facts and you end with definitions 
but is this an adequate distinction every 
one doubtless must be aware of a certain 
difference between what are called inquiries 
into facts and the pursuit of a train of 
mathematical reasoning but what is that 



ik 



v with general reasoning 

difference what is the process of mind 
in the two cases in mathematical pro 
positions you have all the facts before you 
and are deducing logically the consequences 
which flow from the acknowledged data 
in what are called inquiries into fact you 
are generally testing the correctness of some 
verbal statement which indicates the ex 
istence of some but perhaps by no means 
clear impressions upon the human mind or 
you are seeking to supply the want of impres 
sions on your own senses by considering 
the nature and evidence of the impressions 
on the senses of others these impressions 
you gather from what is called testimony 
and testimony introduces all the ambiguities 
and difficulties of language here you must 
have various methods of examination or 
tests of truth drawn from experience and 
suited to the particular case under exami 
nation into which it is unnecessary to enter 
at length 

it is often difficult we say to ascertain 
what is the fact in general all the difficulty 
arises from or is increased by the indefinite 

f 



 language as connected 

ness of the terms in which the statement of 
fact is enwrapped by the witnesses and the 
want of care caution and skill in observing 
and registering observations the extreme 
rapidity with which the hmnan mind min 
gles its own inferences with its observations 
or sensible impressions the confidence 
with which it attaches imaginary or expe 
rienced causes to the perceived effects and 
the difficulty of dissociating the one from 
the other give rise to various embarrass 
ments not merely with regard to reliance 
upon the statements but in ascertaining 
even the meaning of others — embarrass 
ments which most writers of reputation in 
the abstruse subjects of morals and reugion 
rather increase than help to overcome 
however it is possible says the sweet 
minded hartley for two persons of inteui 
gent and candid minds to understand one 
other 

then as to ending with definitions the 
metaphysician who talks of that as his end 
while it is the mathematicians beginning 
should remember that this is only another 



i 



with general reasoning 

mode of stating that his metaphysical dis 
cussions are disputes about words as such 
no doubt they have their importance the 
question being what are the ideas associated 
with or the mehtal phenomena to be classed 
under certain terms which exercise exten 
sive sway over the thoughts feeungs and 
conduct of men let the metaphysician 
then take care of the road by which he 
proposes to pursue this end let him take 
heed whilst he is in pursuit of a proper defi 
nition of a certain term of such a definition 
as will be acceded to by the student that he 
does not embarrass himself and his reader by 
a multitude of other still less defined or 
definable expressions which thicken the 
darkness and the difficulty and conduct to 
dismay and to despair 

these simple observations will i conceive 
go some way towards illustrating the ques 
tion in what manner if in any manner 
demonstrative reasoning may be connected 
with and obtained in metaphysical and 
moral science logic calls our attention 
to the nature and force of terms to those 

f 



 demonstration 

forms of expression which are essentially 
connected with vaud reasonings — reason 
ings to which the mind assents through 
the very nature of the terms mathe 
matical science exhibits the perfection of 
such reasoning and such terms it works 
with symbols significant of certain clear and 
uniform notions of figures and magnitudes 
in its higher branches it is indeed the very 
science of symbols its results arising out of 
the conceived and admitted nature of the 
symbols themselves and their uniform rela 
tions one with another 

before saying a few words on the appuca 
tion of demonstrative reasoning to physical 
and metaphysical science i cannot forbear 
remarking how groundless is the common no 
tion that demonstrative reasoning is stronger 
than all other idnds of evidence — than the 
evidence of the senses or of testimony a 

 there is some logical impropriety in connecting the 
words demonstration and evidence and in talking of 
demonstrative evidence in demonstrative reasoning we 
trace the harmony subsisting among our agreed princi 
ples or admitted notions and conceptions and the con 
sequences or connected notions the senses and testi 



not always necessary 

notion which makes some men call for 
demonstration where it is evidently absurd 
to make that call unless it be remembered 
that the nature of every proposition must 
determine the nature of the demonstration 
or the kind and criteria of proof but who 
shall undertake to demonstrate by any ad 
mitted criteria of proof that milk is white 
and the sky sometimes appears blue these 
are simple instances of names attaching to 
the objects of sense and all communion of 
mind depends on agreeing to give similar 
names to similar impressions and what 
folly would it be when my servant testifies 
that a crowd is in the streets or mr smith 
is in the study to ask him to demonstrate 
these affirmations and propositions the 
conduct of life depends upon notions and 
habitual statements which require no demon 
stration no laboured process of inquirj and 
proof and with the general language of 
human intercourse the associated ideas are 

mony which must be ultimately referred to impressions 
on the senses evidence the existence of certain causes of 
sensation external to ourselves independent of our own 
minds and supply the fundamental conceptions from 
which we reason 



 physical science 

sufficiently clear and uniform for the harmony 
and happiness and the ordinary wants of 
society but when men aspire to what is 
called science then must they take heed of 
language as the ladder on whose rails the 
foot must rest in every step of the ascent 

now with regard to physical science it is 
obvious man is simply the observer and 
registrar of external nature homo est 
naturae minister is the short and obvious 
maxim of the natural philosopher and it 
is evident that the sciences which we call 
inductive merely give us the combined re 
sults of human observation in various spe 
cified departments arranged classified and 
marked and mathematical science is essen 
tial to perfect our observations 

as we range the walks of time and space 
every new object or relation which presents 
itself to attention a new term significant 
of that object or relation must be given 
that same term will suflice for the same 
object or its counterpart when the mind 
meets with it again and the uniformity 
and variety in nature gives rise to the uni 
formity and variety in the structure and use 



physical science 

of human language which as a whole 
may be considered a mystical radiation from 
nature imprinting its pictures upon the 
subtle ground work of the mind a term 
becomes general by being applied to many 
similar objects or impressions the uni 
formity in the objects and processes leads 
us analogically to apply the term laws to 
the phenomena and processes of nature as 
science in its various departments reveals 
and registers the order succession and 
character of these phenomena each sci 
ence having its own pecuuar phenomena to 
register requires its own pecuuar terms 
nor can we where new objects of perception 
new relations of thought are to be expressed 
and held forth to the contemplation of 
the mind object to many new and there 
fore hard terms but in these davs the 
student of nature must be warned against 
supposing that a mere knowledge of terms 
is scientific knowledge although it must be 
admitted as an indispensable and an un 
avoidable part thereof the learner of a 
new science cannot but be as the child whose 



 physical science 

understanding grows to the meaning and 
right use of the language of the world around 
him nor must he complain of difficulties and 
impediments happy the learner however 
who is in the hands of judicious guides who 
consider terms subsidiary to instruction in 
things with whom books are as they 
assuredly ought to be in physical science 
not the substitutes for the companionship of 
nature but the aids to interpret her lessons 
and to observe and to arrange her instruc 
tions the botanist must keep in the fields 
and the garden the chemist in the laboratory 
the geologist in the quarry by the hill side 
or under the cliff the astronomer must sweep 
the heavens with his glass and report to 
others 

 of fields of radiance whose unfading light 
has travelld the profound six thousand years 
nor yet arrived in sight of mortal things 

and it is the beauty of physical science 
when legitimately and lovingly pursued that 
it calls us into communion with fhe creator 
as he reveals himself in his works and away 
from the perverse disputes and vain jang

lings of men in physical science there is 
comparatively little of tiresome useless argu 
mentation the facts on which the classifica 
tions and conclusions rest are evident to those 
senses of whose use not even the fall has 
deprived the children of adam and though 
the senses may sometimes deceive us from 
a kind of natural difference in keenness or 
constitutional imperfection or through hasty 
inferences and casual associations yet the 
philosopher who builds his system of science 
physical or metaphysical upon other ground 
who thinks the root of the tree of life aiid 
knowledge is not in that plain but allsup

speculations of the schoolmen and puzzle 
himself with inquiries into the necessary 
attributes of spirits that have never inhabited

with any worldly interests questions of fact 
and questions of the meaning of terms in 
most matters of pure science would be settled 
without length of debate if men did not wish 
to appear wiser than they are if they were 
content patiefitly to learn and mildly to in

love of nature rather than the estimation of 
men if they looked upon themselves as

of the advantages of that science which is sel

been generally introduced into the system of 
common education will become perhaps the 
principal one by it the student is exercised 
in that part of logic which is termed method 
just as he is by geometry in that of syllo 
gism because natural history is the science 
which requires the most precise methods as 
geometry is that which demands the most 
vigorous reasoning now this art of method 
once well acquired may be appued with in 
finite advantage to studies the most foreign 
to natural history every discussion im

which demands a distribution of materials is 
performed according to the same laws and

 metaphysical science 

by means of some a priori principles which 
are to be received without question upon 
the ipse dixit of this or that philosopher 
there is indeed a giowing perception of the 
importance of the baconian method in moral 
and political science as well as in other de 
partments of human inquiry notwithstand 
ing the tendency of many productions of 
eminence to draw away mens attention from 
the palpable instruction of nature to the 
cloudy obscure inconsistent and unmean 
ing language of the schools but a shght 
acquaintance with the most popular works 
on ethical and metaphysical philosophy will 
lead to the conclusion that they are sadly 
deficient in that exact language which is 
the essential characteristic of all true science 
and must be its foundation 

 a plain and unadorned style says 
lord bacon is the proper style for philo 
sophy yet how far from being plain — 
how studied in variety of phrase — how re 
dundant in poetic and metaphoric ornament 
are the pages of a stewart and mackintosh 
their pages seem to have been written under 



stewart and mackintosh ill 

the impression that no effort of art should be 
spared to beguile the reader in the study of 
matters so dry and so laborious as ethics and 
metaphysics but the result of this is to 
give the real student who is carefully looking 
out for facts and principles more trouble 
than can be estimated in finding the object of 
his search — in separating the important 
from tiie trivial — in testing by the appuca 
tion of precise logic the presence and 
quantity of meaning in a cloudy solution of 
verbiage their dissertations leave hardly 
any definite impression on the mind nor 
is this owing to any peculiar difficulty in 
coming at the facts which lay the foundation 
for principles so much as to an erroneous 
view of the true method or from a bad 
habit of philosophising or perhaps to an in 
disposition for that patient and cautious exa 
mination of details with that simplicity 
and exactness of phrase which have few 
charms for any but the obscure devotees of 
truth

cum multis aliis occur so constantly in these

angels in wandering mazes lost 

the dissertations of stewart and mackin

enjoy a high degree of reputation they are 
spoken of by critics of eminence as inimitable 
and invaluable reviews of great authority 
deught in recording the highest estimation of

ful and pleasing but of what are they the 
history if we compare them wdth the ac 
companying dissertation by playfair on the 
history of natural philosophy they must 
sink in the comparison inasmuch as they 
fail to give that systematic view of real 
though gradual additions to human know

constitute a history of any science or phi

with which he imbues his reader speaking 
of the general effect of lockes discussions 
in preparing the thinking part of his readers 
to a degree till then unknown for the un 
shackled use of their own reason he says 
this has always appeared to me the most 
characteristical feature of lockes essay and 
that to which it is chiefly indebted for its 
immense influence on the philosophy of the 
eighteenth century the essay of locke 
is certainly the production of a profoundly 
thoughtful mind and the diligent reader 
called into sympathy with such a mind must 
partake and imbibe in some degree the spirit 



 locke 

of the great and good philosopher but 
surelv the merits of locke as the founder of 
a school of metaphysicians are of a much 
higher order than such an estimate of his 
chief characteristics implies locke not only 
prepares the reader to reason but prepares 
him to reason well to know himself and 
man and nature better it is difficult for 
us in these times to conceive the clouds and 
mists which the essay on the human under 
standing dissipated and how it illuminated 
the whole horizon of human thought cud 
worths intellectual system is a book which 
sets the reader upon using his own reason 
and it requires a vastly superior stock of eru 
dition to weigh and consider its contents but 
cudworths learning oppresses the mind with 
its weight and lies upon the intellect like a 
london fog upon the chest whereas locke 
clears and braces the understanding he 
has laid the broad and deep basis for a true 
intellectual system in his grand division of 
sensation and reflection the world without 
us and the world within his second chap 
ter on the origin of our ideas and his last 



locke 

chapter on knowledge reason faith and 
judgemept are full of rich just and invalua 
ble matter in the th chapter of the nd 
book he has given incidentally an analysis of 
moral laws which must be in part followed by 
every other inquirer into ethics and jurispru 
dence and the few words of mr austin in 
a note p of his work on jurisprudence 
are far more worthy of the subject than all 
mr stewarts elaborate though elegant 
phraseology allowing for defects which 
were nearly inevitable his analysis is stri 
kingly accurate it evinces that matchless 
power of precise and just thinking with that 
religious regard for general utility and truth 
which marked the incomparable man who 
emancipated human reason from the yoke of 
mystery and jargon and from this his in 
cidental excursions into the field of law and 
morahty and from other passages of his 
essay wherein he touches upon them we 
may infer the important services which he 
would have rendered to the science of ethics 
if complying with the instances of molyneux 
he had examined the subject exactly 
mr stewarts estimate of the defects 



 locke 

and excellencies of locke can never sa 
tisfy the deep and cautious investigator of 
the constitution and powers of the human 
understanding and his everlasting untiring 
intimations that the principles of lockes 
essay if carried out or not guarded by 
lockes admissions lead to the scepticism of 
hume are beyond measure unsatisfactory 
and wearisome to those who neither see nor 
understand the consequence and who find it 
difficult to make out at least from mr 
stewarts statements in what the scepticism 
of hume precisely consisted or how far it 
extended save in the celebrated essay on 
miracles where the uniformity of nature 
or our own experience of it is contrast 
ed in a loose manner with the variable 
ness of human testimony and perhaps in a 
general want of principles and convictions in 
all the objects of metaphysical inquiry 
there are two very different states of mind 
often confounded under the term scepti 
cism one is that of an inquirer who is de 
sirous of placing his own meaning and the 
meaning of others before him in the clear 
est and most satisfactory light and pro

portioning the degree of his assent to the 
strength of the evidence the other that of 
a man who concludes positively against cer 
tain opinions and propositions as having no 
foundation in truth merely because he can 
not keep steadily before him the chain of 
arguments or evidence by which they are 
supported the former is alued to what 
hartley calls a rehgious scepticism which 
receives nothing rashly and is always pre 
pared and seeking for evidence with a view 
of concluding wisely and rationally the lat 
ter is less allied to scepticism than to dog 
matism and becomes dogmatism when a 
man losing sight of the degrees of evidence 
by which the opinions he controverts are sup 
ported thinks to bear them down by the 
strength rather than the justness of his 
assertions it is that of a man who is not 
seeking for truth but doubts its existence 
who is in the habit of questioning every 
thing and believing nothing 

but if mr stewarts work be open to cri 
ticism what shall we say of sir james mack 
intosh whose dissertation excites the prin

cipal reviews to rapture and which mr 
whewell undertakes to preface and to edit 
that it is well — very well — worth perusal may 
be asserted partly because so little is written 
and so httle is read with becoming care in 
such departments of human inquiry but that 
the more it is read and examined the less 
satisfactory it will appear may also be assert 
ed and he who does not choose to rest his 
justification of this assertion upon any ela 
borate showing of his own may shelter him 
self behind mills fragment on mackintosh 
and ask where is the answer to that book 
he may ask why the laudatory reviewers never 
allude to its existence and why since it con 
tains so vigorous hearty and relentless an at 
tack upon the merits of sir james there is no 
attempt to protect his fame to meet and rebut 
its arguments surely mr mill was no puny 
adversary — no mere fly that stings but im 
pedes not the noble racer in his dazzling 
course the peaceful student of nature and 
of truth may not admire the somewhat bear 
ish style in which mr mill shakes and tears 
his prey and with his fragment strews the

ground with fragments of sir jamess mangled 
dissertation he may feel that the arrow from 
mr mills quiver when he touches upon sir 
jamess dandy philosophy and lacka 
daisical style has been dipped too cruelly in 
poison tinged too darkly with the gall of 
bitterness yet while his feelings of pity 
and tenderness are roused and he cries out 
for mercy mercy on sir james it is a cry 
for mercy rather than for justice the soft 
heart wishes to spare and not to trample on 
the fallen but mr mill roused by the ap 
parent though as he calls it affected candour 
with real injustice to mr bentham descends 
like a second achilles to avenge his friend 
and drags his victim thrice round the field 
of his defeat 

seriously he convicts sir james over and 
over ag£dn of those superficial statements of 
that vagueness and confiisedness of lan 
guage which have hitherto been and which 
continue to be the great impediments to 
sound progress in the philosophy of mind 
yet to do sir james some justice he is free 
from that aversion to acknowledge the full 



 hartley 

extent and importance of the law of asso 
ciation which is characteristic of many i 
beueve most of the scotch metaphysical 
writers he shares not in dugald stewarts 
antipathy to hartley he is the first meta 
physical writer of considerable repute of late 
years as far as i know who seems to be 
somewhat duly aware of the merit and im 
portance of the hartleian theory and prin 
ciples he is wrong when he affects to see 
deeper into the moral constitution of man 
than others who have gone before him he 
is convicted of error and absurdity in sup 
posing that those of whom he was writing 
had overlooked a distinction which he had 
sagacity to discover between thoughts and 
feelings perceptions and emotions and even 
while he admits that hartley was a great 
philosopher and a good man there is hardly 
a sentence upon tjie nature of hartleys sys 
tem which conveys to the reader a distinct 
idea of it — of its apprehended merits or 
defects nothing says sir james more 
evidently points out the distinction of the 
hartleian system from all systems called self 



hartley 

ish not to say its superiority in respect to dis 
interestedness over all moral systems before 
butler and hutcheson than that excellent 
part of it which relates to the rule of life 
now the rule of life contains the whole 
moral system of hartley and is a deduction 
from the inquiry which hartley instituted 
into the frame and constitution of mani 
and in the whole compass of human philo 
sophy does any thing surpass that rule of 
life but for butler and hutcheson it is 
evident that hartley would have been the 
favourite philosopher of mackintosh now 
since according to his own showing butler 
and hutcheson have really no system but 
merely assert that human nature has certain 
characteristics which no one ever denied 
and which the philosophers of the hartleian 
school have resolved or tried to resolve 
into the true elementary principles we may 
perhaps notwithstanding mr mills caustic 
animadversions admit that the dls ttation 
of sir james mackintosh will aftci li help 
the student of mental philosopl to the 
quarter where ught is to be found ikit he

it may appear unwarrantable to some 
readers that i should have lapsed from an 
inquin into the nature of mathematical rea 
soning and its application to science sud 
denly to a criticism upon the dissertations 
cf stewart and mackintosh but the reason 
is obvious these dissertations appear to 
be tlie most popular and so far the most 
important treatises pubushed of late upon 
the mental and moral constitution of man 
which is doubtless the noblest of all human 
objects of inquir and contemplation i 
see or fancv that these dissertations both 
admitting and lamenting the ambiguity of 
language as the greatest obstacle in the way 
of the moral philosopher are utterly defi 
cient in earnest and successful efforts to 
grapple with the difficulty and overcome it 
nay increase rather than diminish the evil 
true it is that while we confine ourselves to 
that which we can rigidly and logically prove 
in the present state of ethical science 
we shall go but a little way and we shall

remember that philosophy is after all only 
strong sense or the combined result of 
larger observation and deeper reflection in a 
little better dress than that of ordinary 
life when a writer or reader sits down to

main instniment of thought and communi

the chief difference between the strong and 
the weak mind 

 scribendi recte sapere est et priocipiuin et fons 

in considering the application of mathe 
matical reasoning to moral and metaphysical 
subjects it would be unpardonable to over 
look the philosophical essay of laplace on 
probabilities reviewed by playfair in the 
twentythird volume of the edinburgh review 
laplace has touched upon the applicability 
of the calculus to moral sciences in the fol 
lowing order of topics — first the proba 
bilities of testimony second the votes and 
decisions of assemblies third the judgements 
of legal tribunals fourth tables of mortality 
the mean duration of life of marriages and 
any social relations fifth illusions in the 
estimate of probabilities 

although many just and some curious and 
novel observations are made by laplace 
under these heads yet their general effect is 



laplace on probabilities 

to show the wide difference which exists be 
tween those events which by a strict and 
clear resemblance can be classed together 
and subjected to numerical calculation and 
those which are of more complicated charac 
ter have a less perfect analogy differ from 
each other by many circumstances peculiar 
to each case — diversities growing out of the 
general mental and moral constitution of 
man and which cannot therefore be so 
legitimately classed nor so successfully 
brought within the category of number 
it is indeed somewhat singular that la 
place should have placed tables of mor 
tality and the duration of life and the re 
lative proportion of births marriages and 
deaths to population — events of such uni 
formity of character and so easily and na 
turally classed — in connexion with subjects 
so wide and general as the nature of testi 
mony the decisions of popular assemblies 
and legal tribunals and the illusions of ima 
gination — subjects which he has touched 
but slightly statistical calculations ought 
not indeed to be overlooked by the moralist

since they furnish that extended view of 
the phenomena of life and of the moral 
world which is essential to the deduction of 
sound moral rules and principles and af 
fords great help to the interpretation of the 
laws and ends of divine providence in the 
administration of the world any collection 
of analogous phenomena in the physical 
world is of importance in the moral since 
such collections lay the foundation of general 
rules and supply the exact knowledge which 
is of the greatest use in the conduct of life 
but in collecting analogies we must not 
overlook differences and be duly cautious 
in the application of general maxims which 
are apt to mislead as well as to instruct 
playfair has made some just remarks on the 
vagueness of laplaces language and views 
on the subject of testimony and it is easy 
to conceive that laplaces devotedness to 
the exact sciences may have disposed him to 
an unreasonable mistrust and disregard of all 
conclusions of the pure intellect drawn from 
the phenomena of history and the moral 
world but when playfair intimates that no 



laplace on association 

conclusion founded on the application of the 
calculus to moral probabiuties should be al 
lowed to interfere with the truths of religion 
he seems to imply that such an interference 
may be anticipated and rationally feared and 
to forget that to the philosophic mind truth 
in all departments must be ever consistent 
with itself that though the atoms of the 
universe may be weighed and measured and 
every seeming accident shall be reduced to 
order and to rule the reasons for adoring the 
creator and trusting in him and obeying 
him and for loving our neighbour as our 
selves will only be proportionably multi 
plied 

it is to me truly interesting to observe la 
place perceiving and recording the impor 
tance of that principle of association into 
which hartley followed by mill resolves all 
reasoning the most fertile of all the 
principles of psychology laplace p 
of the vo edition of his essay is that of 
the association of all things which have had 
in the sensorium a simultaneous or regularly 
successive existence an association whereby 



 laplace ox association 

the return of one calls up all the others con 
nected with it the objects which we have 
formerly seen awaken the traces of things 
which in the first iew were associated with 
them these traces call up in the same 
manner those of other objects and so on in 
succession so that by means of one thing 
presented to the mind we can recal an infi 
nity of others and rest our attention upon 
whatever we wsh to consider to this 
principle the employment of signs and lan 
jruae for recallins sensations and ideas be 
lonfs it accounts for the formation and 
analysis of complex abstract and general 
ideas and for reasoning many philosophers 
have well developed this principle which up 
to the present time constitutes the real part 
of metaphysics i have endeavoured to 
show in these papers says hartley at the 
conclusion of his th proposition that 
all reasoning as well as affection is the mere 
result of association 

some further extracts from laplace might 
perhaps be given with interest to the reader 
but it does not appear to me that laplace 



austins jurisprudence 

adds any thing to the ingenious observations 
and speculations of hartley in his chapter 
on the deduction of rules for the ascertain 
ment of truth and advancement of know 
ledge from the mathematical methods of con 
sidering quantity mr dugald stewart in 
the preliminary dissertation to his philoso 
phical essays was pleased to sneer at some 
of the most refined and natural conclusions 
of that great and good philosopher hartley 
in the chapter referred to and to consider 
them as evidence of the unsoundness of his 
understanding but mr stewart is very 
often unfortunate in his selection of the sen 
timents of the greatest english metaphysi 
cians which he marks for peculiar reproba 
tion and contempt 

i have now brought together and laid 
before the reader some thoughts which have 
occurred to me when reading the more po 
pular scientific pubucations of the day i am 
not without hope of awakening the attention 
of a few into whose hands these pages may 
fall to the contents and merits of authors 
whose works they may not already sufli 



 austins jurisprudence 

ciently appreciate but which it is good to 
feed upon as insects on a leaf till the whole 
heart be coloured with the fibre the rea 
der who wishes to see one of the best examples 
which our times have afforded of strictly lo 
gical or demonstrative reasoning applied to 
moral and metaphysical subjects will do well 
to study the work of mr john austin if he is 
not already acquainted with it entitled the 
province of jurisprudence determined 
being the substance of lectures delivered 
at the universitv of london as professor of 
jurisprudence contrary to the practice of 
those numerous writers who confound that 
of which they are treating with every thing 
else with which it can by possibiuty be con 
founded mr austin carefully distinguishes 
his subject from every thing with which it is 
howsoever remotely related he is one of 
the few writers who does not fear to repeat 
himself so much as to be misunderstood by 
his reader he would rather give you a whole 
sentence two or three times over than intro 
duce a pronoun whose antecedent might be 
doubtful or nonexistent he seeks not by 



austins jurisprudence 

showy phrase to impose on the understanding 
of his reader or to smooth over with received 
verbiage the difficulties of his subject and the 
absence of thought and if he sometimes 
wearies with the repetition of a lengthened 
phrase for which a convenient abbreviation 
might have been advantageously adopted we 
could forgive much more than this to a writer 
who feels so acutely the audacity of the para 
dox that men really should think distinctly 
and speak with a meaning as it bears very 
closely indeed upon the topic discussed in 
these pages and as the matter is itself of the 
highest importance in connexion with ethical 
inquiries i shall not scruple to close this 
essay with the following extract from mr 
austins work feeling as i do its fullness 
of truth — 

 if there were a reading public nume 
rous discerning and impartial the science 
of ethics and all the various sciences which 
are nearly related to ethics would advance 
with unexampled rapidity 

 by the hope of obtaining the approba 
tion which it would bestow upon genuine 



 austins jurisprudence 

merit writers would be incited to the patient 
research and reflection which are not less re 
quisite to the improvement of ethical than 
to the advancement of mathematical science 

 shght and incoherent thinking would be 
received with general contempt though it 
were cased in podshed periods studded with 
brilhant metaphors ethics would be con 
sidered bv readers and therefore treated bv 
writers as the matter or subject of a sci 
ence as a subject for persevering and ac 
curate investigation and not as a theme for 
childish and babbling rhetoric 

 this general demand for truth though 
it were clothed in homely guise and this 
general contempt of falsehood and nonsense 
though they were decked with rhetorical 
graces would improve the method and the 
style of inquiries into ethics and into the 
various sciences which are nearly related to 
ethics the writers would attend to the 
suggestions of hobbes and of locke and 
would imitate the method so successfully 
pursued by geometers though such is the 
variety of the premises which some of their 



austins jurisprudence 

inquiries involve and such are the com 
plexity and ambiguity of some of the terms 
that they would often fall short of the per 
fect exactness and coherency which the few 
ness of liis premises and the simplicity and 
definiteness of his expressions enable the 
geometer to reach but though they would 
often fall short of geometrical exactness and 
coherency they might always approach and 
would often attain to them they would 
acquire the art and the habit of defining 
their leading terms of steadily adhering to 
the meanings announced by the definitions 
of carefully examining and distinctly stating 
their premises and of deducing the con 
sequences of their premises with logical 
rigour without rejecting embeuishments 
which might happen to fall in their way the 
only excellencies of style for wliich they 
would seek are precision clearness and con 
ciseness the first being absolutely requisite 
to the successful prosecution of inquiry 
whilst the others enable the reader to seize 
the meaning with certainty and spare him 
unnecessary fatigue 



 austins jurisprudence 

 and what is equally important the pro 
tection afforded by this public to diugent and 
honest writers would inspire into writers 
upon ethics and upon the neaiyrelated 
sciences the spuit of dispassionate inquirj 
the indifferency or impartiahty in the pursuit 
of truth wliicli is just as requisite to the 
detection of truth as continued and close 
attention or sincerity and simpucity of pur 
pose relying on the discernment and the 
justice of a numerous and powerful pubhc 
shielded by its countenance from the shafts 
of the hypocrite and the bigot — indifferent 
to the idle whistung of that harmless storm 
they would scrutuiize established institutions 
and current or received opinions fearlessly 
but coolly with tlie freedom which is de 
manded by general utihty but without the 
antipathy which is begotten by the dread of 
persecution and wliicli is scarcely less ad 
verse than the love of tilings ancient to 
the rapid advancement of science 

 this patience in investigation this dis 
tinctness and accuracy of method this free 
dom and indifferency in the pursuit of the 



austins jurisprudence 

useful and the true would thoroughly dispel 
the obscurity by which the science is clouded 
and would clear it from most of its uncer 
tainties the wish the hope the prediction 
of mr locke would in time be accom 
lished and ethics would rank with the 
sciences which are capable of demonstration 
the adepts in ethical as well as in mathema 
tical science would commonly agree in their 
results and as the jar of their conclusions 
irradually subsided a body of doctrine and 
authority to which the multitude might trust 
would emerge from the existing chaos
