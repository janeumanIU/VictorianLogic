PREFACE. 



This book makes no pretence of giving to the 
world a new theory of our intellectual operations. 
Its claim to attention, if it possess any, is grounded 
on the fact that it is an attempt not to supersede, but 
to embody and systematize, the best ideas which have 
been either promulgated on its subject by speculative 
writers, or conformed to by accurate thinkers in their 
scientific inquiries. 

To cement together the detached fragments of a 
subject, never yet treated as a whole; to harmonize 
the true portions of discordant theories, by supplying 
the links of thought necessary to connect them, and by 
disentangling them from the errors with which they 
are always more or less interwoven; must necessarily 
require a considerable amount of original speculation. 
To other originality than this, the present work lays 
no claim. In the existing state of the cultivation of 
the sciences, there would be a very strong presumption 
against any one who should imagine that he had 
effected a revolution in the theory of the investi- 
gation of truth, or added any fundamentally new 
process to the practice of it. The improvement which 
remains to be effected in methods of philosophiz- 
ing (and the author believes that they have much

need of improvement) can only consist in performing, 
more systematically and accurately, operations with 
which, at least in their elementary form, the human 
intellect m some one or other of its employments is 
already familiar. 

In the portion of the work which treats of Ratio- 
cination, the author has not deemed it necessary to 
enter into technical details which may he obtained in 
so perfect a shape from the existing treatises on what 
is termed the Logic of the Schools. In the contempt 
entertained by many modern philosophers for the 
syllogistic art, it will be seen that he by no means 
participates ; although the scientific theory on which 
its defence is usually rested appears to him erro- 
neous : and the view which he has suggested of the 
nature and functions of the Syllogism may, perhaps, 
afford the means of conciliating the principles of the 
Art with as much as is well-grounded in the doctrines 
and objections of its assailants. 

The same abstinence from details could not be 
observed in the First Book, on Names and Proposi- 
tions; because many useful principles and distinctions 
which were contained in the old Logic, have been 
gradually omitted from the writings of its later 
teachers; and it appeared desirable both to revive 
these, and to reform and rationalize the philosophical 
foundation on which they stood. The earlier chapters 
of this preliminary Book will consequently appear, to 
some readers, needlessly elementary and scholastic. 
But those who know in what darkness the nature of 
our knowledge, and of the processes by which it is

obtained, is often involved by a confused apprehension 
of the import of the diflferent classes of Words and 
Assertions, will not regard these discussions as either 
frivolous, or irrelevant to the topics considered in the 
later Books. 

On the subject of Induction, the task to be 
performed was that of generalizing the modes of in- 
vestigating truth and estimating evidence, by which 
so many important and recondite laws of nature have, 
in the various Sciences, been aggregated to the stock 
of human knowledge. That this is not a task free 
from difficulty may be presumed from the fact, that 
even at a very recent period, eminent writers (among 
whom it is sufficient to name Archbishop Whately, 
and the author of a celebrated article on Bacon in 
the Edinburgh Review,) have not scrupled to pronounce 
it impossible. The author has endeavoured to combat 
their theory in the manner in which Diogenes con- 
futed the sceptical reasonings against the possibility 
of motion; remembering that Diogenes' argument 
would have been equally conclusive, although his 
individual perambulations might not have extended 
beyond the circuit of his own tub. 

Whatever may be the value of what the author has 
succeeded in effecting on this branch of his subject, 
it is a duty to acknowledge that for much of it 
he has been indebted to several important trea- 
tises, partly historical and partly philosophical, on 
the generalities and processes of physical science, 
which have been published within the last few years. 
To these treatises, and to their authors, he has endea-

VI PREFACE. 

voured to do full justice in the body of the work. 
But as with one of these writers, Mr. Whewell, he 
has occasion frequently to express differences of 
opinion, it is more particularly incumbent on him in 
this place to declare, that without the aid derived 
from the facts and ideas contained in that gentleman's 
History of the Inductive Sciences, the corresponding 
portion of this work would probably not have been 
written. 

The concluding Book is an attempt to contribute 
towards the solution of a question, which the decay of 
old opinions, and the agitation that disturbs Euro- 
pean society to its inmost depths, render as important 
in the present day to the practical interests of human 
life, as it must at all times be to the completeness of 
our speculative knowledge: viz., Whether moral and 
social phenomena are really exceptions to the general 
certainty and uniformity of the course of nature; and 
how far the methods, by which so many of the laws 
of the physical world have been numbered among 
truths irrevocably acquired and universally assented 
to, can be made instrumental to the gradual formation 
of a similar body of received doctrine in moral and 
political science. 

While the views promulgated in these volumes 
still await the verdict of competent judges, it would 
have been useless to attempt to make the exposition 
of them so elementary, as to be suited to readers 
wholly unacquainted with the subject. It can scarcely 
be hoped that the Second Book will be throughout 
intelligible to any one who has not gone carefully

through some one of the common treatises on Logic; 
among which that of Archbishop Whately is, on every 
account, to be preferred. And the Third Book presup- 
poses some degree of acquaintance with the most 
general truths of mathematics, as well as of the prin- 
cipal branches of physical science, and with the evi- 
dence on which those doctrines rest. Among books 
professedly treating of the mental phenomena, a 
previous familiarity with the earlier portion of Dr. 
Brown*s Lectures, or with his b-eatise on Cause and 
EflFect, would, though not indispensable, be advan- 
tageous; that philosopher having, in the author's 
judgment, taken a more correct view than any other 
English writer on the subject, of the ultimate intel- 
lectual laws of scientific inquiry; while his unusual 
powers of popularly stating and felicitously illustrating 
whatever he understood, render his works the best 
preparation which can be suggested, for speculations 
similar to those contained in this Treatise.

INTRODUCTION. 



§ 1. Therb is as great diversity among authors in 
the modes which they have adopted of defining logic, 
as in their treatment of the details of it. This is 
vfhnt might naturaUy he expected on any subject on 
which writers have availed themselves of the same 
language, as a means of delivering different ideas. 
Ethics and jurisprudence are liable to the remark 
in common with logic. Almost every philosopher 
having taken a different view of some of the par- 
ticulars which these branches of knowledge are usually 
understood to include; each has so framed his defi- 
nition as to indicate beforehand his own peculiar 
tenets, and sometimes to beg the question in their 
favour. 

This diversity is not so much an evil to be com- 
plained of, as an inevitable and in some degree a 
proper result of the imperfect state of those sciences. 
There cannot be agreement about the definition of a 
thing, until there is agreement about the thing itself. 
To define a thing, is to select from among the whole 
of its properties those which shall be understood to 
be designated and declared by its name; and the 
properties must be very well known to us before we 
can be competent to determine which of them are 
fittest to be chosen for this purpose. Accordingly, in 
the case of so complex an aggregation of particulars 
as are comprehended in anything which can be called 
a science, the definition we set out with is seldom 
that which a more extensive knowledge of the subject

2 INTRODUCTION. 

shows to be the most appropriate. Until we know 
the particulars themselves, we cannot fix upon the 
most correct and compact mode of circumscribing 
them by a general description. It was not till after 
an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the 
details of chemical phenomena, that it was foimd 
possible to frame a rational definition of chemistry; 
and the definition of the science of life and organi- 
zation is still a matter of dispute. So long as the 
sciences are imperfect, the definitions must partake 
of their imperfections; and if the former are pro- 
gressive, the latter ought to be so too. As much, 
therefore, as is to be expected from a definition 
placed at the commencement of a subject, is that it 
should define the scope of our inquiries: and the 
definition, which I am about to ofier of the science of 
logic, pretends to nothing more, than to be a state- 
ment of the question which I have put to myself, and 
which this book is an attempt to resolve. TTie reader 
is at liberty to object to it as a definition of logic; but 
it is at all events a con-ect definition of the subject of 
these volumes. 

4 2. Logic has often been called the Art of Rea- 
soning. A writer* who has done more than any 
other living person to restore this study to the rank 
from which it had fallen in the estimation of the cul- 
tivated classes in our own country, has adopted the 
above definition with an amendment; he has defined 
logic to be the Science, as well as the Art, of reason- 
ing; meaning, by the former term, the analysis of the 
mental process which takes place whenever we reason, 
and by the latter, the rules, grounded upon that

analysis, for conducting the process correctly. There 
can be no doubt as to the propriety of the emendation. 
A right understanding of the mental process itself, of 
the conditions it depends upon, and the steps of 
which it consists, is the only basis on which a system 
of rules, fitted for the direction of the process, can 
possibly be founded. Art necessarily presupposes 
knowledge ; art, in any but its infant state, presup- 
poses scientific knowledge : and if every art does not 
bear the name of the science upon which it rests, it 
is only because several sciences are often necessary to 
form the groundwork of a single art. Such is the 
complication of human affsurs, that to enable one 
thing to be done, it is often requisite to know the 
nature and properties of many things. 

Ix^c, then, comprises the science of reasoning, 
as well as an art, founded on that science. But the 
word Reasoning, again, like most other scientific 
terms in popular use, abounds in ambiguities. In 
one of its acceptations, it means syllogizing ; or the 
mode of inference which may be called (with suffi- 
cient accuracy for the present purpose) concluding 
from generals to particulars. In another of its senses, 
to reason, is simply to infer any assertion, from asser- 
tions already admitted : and in this sense, induction 
is as much entitled to be called reasoning as the 
demonstrations of geometry. 

Writers on logic have generally preferred the for- 
mer acceptation of the term; the latter, and more 
extensive signification, is that in which I mean to use 
it. I do this by virtue of the right I claim for every 
author, to give whatever provisional definition he 
pleases of his own subject. But sufficient reasons 
will, I believe, unfold themselves as we advance, why 
this should be not only the provisional but the final

definition. It involves, at all events, no arbitrary 
change in the meaning of the word ; for, with the 
general usage of the English language, the wider sig- 
nification, I believe, accords better than the more 
restricted one. 

4 3. But reasoning, even in the widest sense of 
which the word is susceptible, does not seem to include 
all that is included, either in the best, or even in the 
most current, conception of the scope and province 
of our science. The employment of the word Logic 
to denote the theory of argumentation, is derived from 
the AristoteUan, or, as they are commonly termed, the 
scholastic logicians. Yet even with them, in their 
systematic treatises, argumentation was the subject 
only of the third part: the two former treated of 
terms, and of propositions ; under one or other of 
which heads were, moreover, included. Definition and 
Division. Professedly, indeed, these previous topics 
were introduced only on account of their connexion 
with reasoning, and as a preparation for the doctrine 
and rules of the syllogism. Yet they were treated 
with greater minuteness, and dwelt upon at greater 
length, than was required for that purpose alone. 
More recent writers on logic have generally under- 
stood the term as it was employed by the able authors 
of the Port Royal Logic; viz., as equivalent to the 
Art of Thinking. Nor is this acceptation confined 
to philosophers, and works of science. Even in con- 
versation, the ideas usually connected with the word 
Logic, include at least precision of language, and accu- 
racy of classification: and we perhaps oftener hear 
persons speak of a logical arrangement, or expressions 
logically defined, than of conclusions logically deduced 
from premisses. Moreover, a man is often called a

great logician, or a man of powerful logic, not for the 
accuracy of his deductions, but for the extent of his ' 
command over premisses ; because the general proposi- 
tions required for explaining a difficulty or refuting a 
sophism, copiously and promptly occur to him ; as in 
the case of Chillingworth, or Samuel Johnson. Whe- 
ther, therefore, we conform to the practice of those 
who have made the subject their particular study, 
or to that of popular writers and common discourse^ 
the province of logic will include several operations of 
the intellect not usually considered to fall within the 
meaning of the terms Reasoning and Argumentation. 
These various operations might be brought within 
the compass of the science, and the additional advan- 
tage be obtained of a very simple definition, if, by an 
extension of the term, sanctioned by high authorities, 
we were to define logic as the science which treats of 
the operations of the human understanding in the pur- 
suit of truth. For to this ultimate end, naming, clas- 
sification, definition, and all the other operations over 
which logic has ever claimed jurisdiction, are essen- 
tially subsidiary. They may all be regarded as con- 
trivances for enabling a person to know the truths 
which are needful to him, and to know them at the 
precise moment at which they are needful. Other 
purposes, indeed, are also served by these operations ; 
for instance, that of imparting our knowledge to 
others. But, viewed with regard to this purpose, they 
have never been considered as within the province of 
the logician. The sole object of Logic is the guidance .. 
of one's own thoughts ; the communication of those 
thoughts to others falls under the consideration of 
Rhetoric, in the large sense in which that art was 
conceived by the ancients ; or of the still more exten- 
sive art of Education. Logic takes cognizance of all

intellectual operations, only as they conduce to our 
own knowledge, and to our command over that know- 
ledge for our own uses. If there were but one 
rational being in the universe, that being might be a 
perfect logician; and the science and art of logic 
would be the same for that one person, as for the 
whole human race. 

§ 4. But, if the definition which we formerly 
examined included too little, that which is now sug- 
gested has the opposite fault of including too much. 

Truths are known to us in two ways: some are 
known directly, and of themselves ; some through the 
medium of other truths. The former are the subject 
of Intuition, or Consciousness; the latter, of Inference. 
The truths known by intuition are the original pre- 
misses from which all others are inferred. Our assent 
to the conclusion being grounded upon the truth of 
the premisses, we never could arrive at any knowledge 
by reasoning, unless something could be known ante- 
cedently to all reasoning. 

Examples of truths known to us by immediate 
consciousness, are our own bodily sensations and 
mental feelings. I know directly, and of my own 
knowledge, that I was vexed yesterday, or that I am 
hungry to-day. Examples of truths which we know 
only by way of inference, are occurrences which took 
place while we were absent, the events recorded in 
history, or the theorems of mathematics. The two 
former we infer from the testimony adduced, or frt>m 
the traces of those past occurrences which still exist; 
the latter, from the premisses laid down in books of 
geometry, under the title of definitions and axioms. 
Whatever we are capable of knowing must belong to 
the one class or to the other ; must be in the number

DBFINITION AND PROVINCB OF LOGIC. 7 

of the primitive data, or of the conclusions which can 
be drawn therefrom. 

With the original data, or ultimate premisses of 
our knowledge; with their nmnber or nature, the 
mode in which they are obtained, or the tests by 
which they may be distinguished ; logic, in a direct 
way at least, has, in the sense in which I conceive the 
science, nothing to do. These questions are partly 
not a subject of science at all, partly that of a very 
different science. 

Whatever is known to us by consciousness, is 
known beyond possibility of question. What one 
sees^ or feels, whether bodily or mentally, one cannot 
but be sure that one sees or feels. No science is 
required for the purpose of establishing such truths ; 
no rules of art can render our knowledge of them 
more certain than it is in itself. There is no logic for 
this portion of our knowledge. 

But we may fancy that we see or feel what we 
in reality infer. Newton saw the truth of many pro- 
positions of geometry without reading the demonstra- 
tions, but not, we may be sure, without their flashing 
through his mind. A truth, or supposed truth, which 
is really the result of a very rapid inference, may 
seem to be apprehended intuitively. It has long been 
agreed by philosophers of the most opposite schools, 
that this mistake is actually made in so familiar an 
instance as that of the eyesight. There is nothing 
which we appear to ourselves more directly conscious 
of, than the distance of an object from us. Yet it 
has long been ascertained, that what is perceived by 
the eye, is at most nothing more than a variously 
coloured surface ; that when we fancy we see distance, 
all we really see is certain variations of apparent size, 
and more or less faintness of colour ; and that our 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



O INTRODUCTION. 

estimate of the object*s distance from us is the result 
of a comparison (made with so much rapidity that 
we are imconscious of making it) between the size 
and colour of the object as they appear at the time, 
and the size and colour of the same or of similar 
objects' as they appeared when close at hand, or 
when their degree of remoteness was known by other 
evidence. The perception of distance by the eye, 
which seems so like intuition, is thus, in reality, an 
inference^grounded on experience ; an inference, too, 
which we learn to make ; and which we make with 
more and more correctness as our experience increases; 
though in famiUar cases it takes place so rapidly as to 
appear exactly on a par with those perceptions of sight 
which are really intuitive, our perceptions of colour*. 
Of the science, therefore, which expounds the 
operations of the human imderstanding in the pursuit 
of truth, one essential part is the inquiry: What are 
the truths which are the objects of intuition or con- 
sciousness, and what are those which we merely infer? 
But this inquiry has never been considered a portion 
of logic. Its place is in another and a perfectly dis- 
tinct department of science, which may be called the 
higher or transcendental metaphysics. For such is 
the title which has been given to that portion of 
mental philosophy which attempts to determine what 
part of the furniture of the mind belongs to it origi- 
nally, and what part is constructed by itself out of 



? This celebrated theory has recently been called in question by 
a writer of deserved reputation, Mr. Samuel Bailey; but I do not 
conceive that the grounds on which it has been received by phi- 
losophers for a century past, have been at all shaken by that gentle- 
man's objections. I have elsewhere said what appeared to me 
necessary in reply to his arguments. — Westminster BemeWy for

materials famished from without. To this science 
appertain the great and much debated questions of 
the existence of matter ; of the existence of spirit, 
and the distinction between it and matter ; of the 
reality of time and space, as things without the mind, 
and distinguishable from the objects which are said to 
exist in them. For, in the present state of the dis- 
cussion on these topics, it is universally allowed that 
the existence of matter or of spirit, of space or of 
time, is, in its nature, unsusceptible of being proved; 
and that whatever is known of them, is known by 
immediate intuition. To the same science belong the 
inquiries into the nature of Conception, Perception, 
Memory, and Belief; all of which are operations of 
the understanding in the pursuit of truth ; but with 
which, as phenomena of the mind, or with the possi- 
bility which may or may not exist of analyzing any 
of them into simpler phenomena, the logician as such 
has no concern. To this science must also be referred 
the following, and all analogous questions : To what 
extent our intellectual faculties and our emotions are 
innate — ^to what extent the result of association. 
Whether God, and duty, are realities, the existence of 
which is manifest to us a priori by the constitution 
of our rational faculty ; or whether our ideas of them 
are acquired notions, the origin of which we are able 
to trace"'and explain ; and the reality of the objects 
themselves a question not of consciousness or intui- 
tion, but of evidence and reasoning. 

The province of logic must be restricted to that 
portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences 
from truths previously known ; whether those ante- 
cedent data be general propositions, or particular 
observations and perceptions. Logic is not the 
science of Belief, but the science of Proof, or 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



10 INTRODUCTION. 

Evidence. So far forth as belief professes to be 
founded upon proof, the office of logic is to supply a 
test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well 
grounded. With the claims which any proposition 
has to belief on its own intrinsic evidence, that is, 
without evidence in the proper sense of the word, logic 
has nothing to do. 

§ 5. As the far greatest portion of our knowledge, 
whether of general truths or of particular facts, is 
avowedly matter of inference, nearly the whole, not 
only of science, but of human conduct, is amenable 
to the authority of logic. To draw inferences has 
been said to be the great business of life. Every one 
has daily, hourly, and momentary need of ascertaining 
facts which he has not directly observed ; not from 
any general purpose of adding to his stock of know- 
ledge, but because the facts themselves are of import- 
ance to his interests or to his occupations. The 
business of the magistrate, of the military commander, 
of the navigator, of the physician, of the agriculturist, 
is merely to judge of evidence, and to act accordingly. 
They all have to ascertain certain facts, in order that 
they may afterwards apply certain rules, either devised 
by themselves, or prescribed for their guidance by 
others ; and as they do this well or iU, so they dis- 
charge well or ill the duties of their several callings. 
It is the only occupation in which the mind never 
ceases to be engaged ; and is the subject, not of logic, 
but of knowledge in general. Our definition of logic, 
therefore, will be in danger of including the whole 
field of knowledge, unless we qualify it by some further 
limitation, showing distinctly where the domain of the 
other arts and sciences and of common prudence ends, 
and that of logic begins.

DEFINITION AND PROVINCE OF LOGIC. 11 

The distinction is, that the science or knowledge 
of the particular subject-matter furnishes the evidence, 
while logic furnishes the principles and rules of the 
estimation of evidence. Logic does not pretend to 
teach the surgeon what are the symptoms which indi- 
cate a violent death. This he must learn from his 
own experience and observation, or from that of others, 
his predecessors in his peculiar science. But logic 
sits in judgment on the sufficiency of that observation 
and experience to justify his rules, and on the suffici- 
ency of his rules to justify his conduct. It does not 
give him proofs, but teaches him what makes them 
proofs, and how he is to judge of them. Logic alone 
can never show that the fact A proves the fact B ; but 
it can point out to what conditions all facts must 
conform, in order that they may prove other facts. 
To decide whether any given fact fulfils these condi- 
tions, or whether facts can be found which fulfil them 
in any given case, belongs, exclusively, to the parti- 
cular art or science, or to our knowledge of the par- 
ticular subject. 

It is in this sense that logic is, what Bacon so 
expressively called it, ars artium; the science of 
science itself. All science consists of data and con- 
clusions from those data, of proofs and what they 
prove: now logic points out what relations must sub- 
sist between data and whatever can be concluded 
from them, between proof and everything which it 
can prove. If there be any such indispensable rela- 
tions, and if these can be precisely determined, every 
particular branch of science, as well as every indi- 
vidual in the guidance of his conduct, is bound 
to conform to those relations, under the penalty of 
making false inferences, of drawing conclusions which 
are not grounded in the realities of things. Whatever 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



12 INTRODUCTION. 

has at any time been concluded justly, whatever know- 
ledge has been acquired otherwise than by immediate 
intuition, depended upon the observance of the laws, 
which it is the province of logic to investigate. If the 
conclusions are just, and the knowledge sound, those 
laws have actually been observed. 

§ 6. We need not, therefore, seek any farther for 
a solution of the question, so often agitated, respect- 
ing the utility of logic. If a science of logic exists, or 
is capable of existing, it must be useful. If there be 
rules to which every mind conforms in every instance 
in which it judges rightly, there seems little necessity 
for discussing whether a person is more likely to 
observe those rules, when he knows the rules, than 
when he is unacquainted with them. 

A science may undoubtedly be brought to a certain, 
not inconsiderable, stage of advancement, without the 
application of any other logic to it than what all per- 
sons, who are said to have a sound understanding, 
acquire empirically in the course of their studies. 
Men judged of evidence, and often very correctly, 
before logic was a science, or they never could have 
made it one. And they executed great mechanical 
works before they understood the laws of mechanics. 
But there are limits both to what mechanicians can 
do without principles of mechanics, and to what 
thinkers can do without principles of logic. And the 
limits, in the two cases, are of the same kind. The 
extent of what man can do without understanding the 
theory of what he is doing, is in all cases much the 
same : he can do whatever is very easy ; what requires 
only time, and patient industry. But in the progress 
of science from its easiest to its more difficult pro- 
blems, every great step in advance has had either as 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION AND PROVINCB OF LOGIC. 13 

its precursor or as its accompaniment and necessary 
condition, a corresponding improvement in the notions 
and principles of logic received among the most ad- 
vanced thinkers. And if several of the more difficult 
sciences are still in so defective a state ; if not only so 
Uttle is proved, but disputation has not terminated 
even about the little which seemed to be so; the 
reason perhaps is, that men's logical notions have not 
yet acquired the degree of extension, or of accuracy, 
requisite for the estimation of the evidence proper to 
those particular departments of knowledge. 

§ 7. Logic, then, is the science of the operations 
of the understanding which are subservient to the I 
estimation of evidence : both the process itself of pro- \ 
ceeding from known truths to unknown, and all intel- 
lectual operations auxiliary to this. It includes, 
therefore, the operation of Naming ; for language is 
an instrument of thought, as well as a means of 
communicating our thoughts. It includes, also. 
Definition, and Classification. For, the use of these 
operations (putting all other minds than one's own 
out of consideration) is to serve not only for keeping 
our evidences and the conclusions from them*^rma- 
nent and readily accessible in the memory, but for so 
marshalling the facts which we may at any time be 
engaged in investigating, as to enable us to perceive 
more clearly what evidence there is, and to judge 
with fewer chances of error whether it be sufficient. 
The analysis of the instruments we employ in the 
investigation of truth, is part of the analysis of the 
investigation itself; since no art is complete, unless 
another art, that of constructing the tools and fitting 
them for the purposes of the art, is embodied in it. 

Our object, therefore, will be to attempt a correct 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



14 INTRODUCTION. 

analysis of the intellectual process called Reasoning or 
Inference, and of such other mental operations as are 
intended to faciUtate this: as well as, on the founda- 
tion of this analysis, and pari passu with it, to bring 
together or frame a set of rules or canons for testing 
the sufficiency of any given evidence to prove any 
given proposition. 

With respect to the first part of this undertaking, 
I do not attempt to decompose the mental operations 
in question into their ultimate elements. It is enough 
if the analysis as far as it goes is correct, and if it 
goes far enough for the practical purposes of logic 
considered as an art. The separation of a compUcated 
phenomenon into its component parts, is not Hke a 
connected and interdependent chain of proof. If one 
link of an argument breaks, the whole drops to the 
ground; but one step towards an analysis holds good, 
and has an independent value, though we should 
never be able to make a second. Hie results of 
analytical chemistry are not the less valuable, though 
it should be discovered that all which we now caU 
simple substances are really compounds. All other 
things are at any rate compounded of those elements: 
whether the elements themselves admit of decomposi- 
tion, is an important inquiry, but does not affect the 
certainty of the science up to that point. 

I shall, accordingly, attempt to analyze the process 
of inference, and the processes subordinate to infe- 
rence, so far only as may be requisite for ascertaining 
the difference between a correct and an incorrect 
performance of those processes. The reason for thus 
limiting our design, is evident. It has been said by 
objectors to logic, that we do not learn to use our 
muscles by studying their anatomy. The fact is not 
quite fairly stated; for if the action of any of our 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION AND PROVINCE OF LOGIC. 15 

muscles were vitiated by local weakness, or other 
physical defect, a knowledge of their anatomy might 
be very necessary for effecting a cure. But we should 
be justly liable to the criticism involved in this objec- 
tion, were we, in a treatise on Logic, to carry the 
analysis of the reasoning process beyond the point at 
which any inaccuracy which may have crept into it 
must become visible. In learning bodily exercises (to 
carry on the same illustration) we do, and must, 
analyze the bodily motions so far as is necessary for 
distinguishing those which ought to be performed 
from those which ought not. To a similar extent, 
and no further, it is necessary that the logician should 
analyze the mental processes with which Logic is 
concerned. Any ulterior and minuter analysis must 
be left to transcendental metaphysics; which in this, 
as in other parts of our mental nature, decides 
what are ultimate facts, and what are resolvable into 
other facts. And I beUeve it will be found that 
the conclusions arrived at in this work have no 
necessary connexion with any particular views re- 
specting the ulterior analysis. Logic is common 
ground on which the partisans of Hartley and of 
Reid, of Locke and of Kant, may meet and join 
hands. Particular and detached opinions of aU these 
philosophers will no doubt occasionally be controverted, 
since all of them were logicians as well as metaphy- 
sicians; but the field on which their great battles have 
been fought, lies beyond the boundaries of our science ; 
and the views which will be here promulgated, may, I 
believe, be held in conjunction with the principal 
conclusions of any one of their systems of philosophy. 
It cannot, indeed, be pretended that logical prin- 
ciples can be altogether irrelevant to those more 
abstruse discussions; nor is it possible but that the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



16 INTRODUCTION. 

view we are led to take of the problem which logic 
proposes, must have a tendency favourable to the 
adoption of some one opinion on these controverted 
subjects rather than another. Logic, although differing 
from the higher metaphysics like the other half of a 
a great whole, (the one being the science of the appre- 
ciation of evidence, the other having for its main 
object to determine what are the propositions for the 
establishment of which evidence is not required,) yet 
when viewed under another of its aspects, stands m 
the same relation to tliis, its sister science, as it does 
to all the other sciences. For metaphysics, in endea- 
vouring to solve its own peculiar problem, must 
employ means, the vaUdity of which falls under the 
cognizance of logic. It proceeds, no doubt, as far as 
possible, merely by a closer and more attentive inter- 
rogation of our consciousness, or more properly 
speaking, of our memory ; and so far is not amenable 
to logic. But wherever this method is insufficient to 
attain the end of its inquiries, it must proceed, like 
other sciences, by means of evidence. Now, the 
moment this science begins to draw inferences from 
evidence, logic becomes the sovereign judge whether 
its inferences are well-grounded, or what other 
inferences would be so. 

This influence, however, of logic over the ques- 
tions which have divided philosophers in the higher 
regions of metaphysics, is indirect and remote ; and I 
can conscientiously affirm, that no one proposition 
laid down in this work has been adopted for the sake 
of establishing, or with any reference to its fitness for 
being employed in establishing, preconceived opinions 
in any department of knowledge or of inquiry on 
which the speculative world is stiU undecided.

Chapter I. 

OF THE NECESSITY OF COMMENCING WITH AN 
ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE. 

§ I. It is so much the established practice of 
writers oa logic to commence their treatises by a few 
general observations (in most cases, it is true, rather 
meagre) on Terms and their varieties, that it will, 
perhaps, scarcely be required from me, in merely 
following the common usage, to be as particular in 
assigning my reasons, as it is usually expected that 
those should be who deviate from it. 

The practice, indeed, is recommended by con- 
siderations far too obvious to require a formal justifi- 
cation. Logic is a portion of the Art of Thinking : 
Language is evidently, and by the admission of all 
philosophers, one of the principal instruments or helps 
of thought ; and any imperfection in the instrument, 
or isx the mode of employing it, is confessedly liable, 
still ipore than in almost any other art, to confuse and 
impede the process, and destroy all ground of con- 
fidence in the result. For a mind not previously 
versed in the meaning and right use of the various 
kinds of words, to attempt the study of methods of 
philosophizing, would be as if some one should attempt 
to make himself an astronomical observer, having 
never learned to adjust the focal distance of his 
optical instruments so as to see distinctly. 

Since Reasoning, or Inference, the principal 

[^itad by Google

subject of logic, is an operation which usually takes 
place by means of words, and in all complicated cases 
can take place in no other way ; those who have not 
a thorough insight into the signification and purposes 
of words, will be under almost a necessity of reasoning 
or inferring incorrectly. And logicians have generally 
felt that unless, in the very first stage, they removed 
this fertile source of error ; unless they taught their 
pupil to put away the glasses which distort the object, 
and to use those which are adapted to his purpose in 
such a manner as to assist, not perplex, his vision ; he 
would not be in a condition to practise the remaining 
part of their discipline with any prospect of advantage. 
Therefore it is that an inquiry into language, so for 
as is needful to guard against the errors to which it 
gives rise, has at all times been deemed a necessary 
preliminary to the science of logic. 

But there is another reason, of a still more funda- 
mental nature, why the import of words should be 
the earliest subject of the logician's consideration : 
because without it he cannot eicaroine into the import 
of Propositions. Now this is a subject which stands 
on the very threshold of the science of logic. 

The object of logic, as defined in the Introductory 
Chapter, is to ascertain how we come by that portion 
of our knowledge (much the greatest portion) which 
is not intuitive; and by what criterion we can, in 
matters not self-evident, distinguish between things 
proved and things not proved, between what is 
worthy and what is unworthy of belief. Of the 
various questions which the universe presents to our 
inquiring faculties, some are soluble by direct con- 
sciousness, others only by means of evidence. Logic 
is concerned with these last. The solution, by means 
of evidence, of questions respecting the universe and

NECESSITY OF AN ANALYSIS OF NAMES. 21 

the things contained in it, is the purpose of logic. 
But before inquiring into the mode of resolving 
questions, it is necessary to inquire, what are the 
questions which present themselves ? what questions 
are conceivable ? what inquiries are there, to which 
men have either obtained, or been able to imagine it 
possible that they should obtain, an answer ? This 
point is best ascertained by a survey and analysis of 
Propositions. 

$ 2. The answer to every question which it is 
possible to frame, is contained in a Proposition, or 
Assertion. Whatever can be an object of belief, or 
even of disbelief, must, when put into words, assume 
the form of a proposition. All truth and all errdr lie 
in propositions. What, by a convenient misapplica- 
tion of an abstract term, we call a Truth, is simply a 
True Proposition ; and errors are false propositions. 
To know the import of all possible propositions, would 
be to know all questions which can be raised, all 
matters which are susceptible of being either believed 
or disbelieved. How many kinds of inquiries can be 
propounded ; how many kinds of judgments can be 
made ; and how many kinds of propositions it is 
possible to frame with a meaning ; are but different 
forms of one and the same question. Since, then, the 
objects of all Belief and of all Inquiry express them- 
selves in propositions ; a sufficient scrutiny of Propo- 
sitions and of their varieties will apprize us what 
questions mankind have actually asked themselves, 
and what, in the nature of answers to those questions, 
they have actually thought they had grounds to 
believe. 

Now the first glance at a proposition shows that 
it is formed by putting together two names. A pro-

position, according to the common simple definition, 
which is sufficient for our purpose, is, discourse, in 
which something is affirmed or denied of something. 
Thus, in the proposition. Gold is yellow, the quality 
yellow is affirmed of the substance gold. In the pro- 
position, Franklin was not bom in England, the fact 
expressed by the words born in England is denied of 
the man Franklin. 

Every proposition consists of three parts : the 
Subject, the Predicate, and the Copula. The pre- 
dicate is the name denoting that which is affirmed or 
denied. The subject is the name denoting the person 
or thing which something is affirmed or denied of. 
The copula is the sign denoting that there is an 
affirmation or denial ; and thereby enabling the hearer 
or reader to distinguish a proposition from any other 
kind of discourse. Thus, in the proposition, The 
earth is round, the Predicate is the word rounds which 
denotes the quality affirmed, or (as the phrase is) 
predicated: the earthy words denoting the object 
which that quality is affirmed of, compose the Subject; 
the word is, which serves as the connecting mark 
between the subject and predicate, to show that one 
of them is affirmed of the other^ is called the Copula. 
Dismissing, for the present, the copula, of which 
more will be said hereafter, every proposition, then, 
consists of at least two names ; brings together two 
names, in a particular manner. This is already a 
first step towards what we are in quest of. It appears 
from this, that for an act of belief, one object is not 
sufficient; the simplest act of belief supposes, and 
has something to do with, two objects : two names, to 
say the least ; and (since the names must be names 
of something) two nameahle things. A large class of 
thinkers would cut the matter short by saying, two

NECESSITY OF AN ANALYSIS OF NAMES. 23 

ideas. They would say, that the subject and predicate 
are both of them names of ideas ; the idea of gold, 
for instance, and the idea of yellow ; and that what 
takes place (or a part of what takes place) in the act 
of belief, consists in bringing (as it is often expressed) 
one of these ideas under the other. But this we are 
not yet in a condition to say : whether such be the 
correct mode of describing the phenomenon^ is an 
after consideration. The result with which for the 
present we must be contented, is, that in every act of 
belief two objects are in some manner taken cogni- 
zance of; that there can be no belief claimed, or 
question propounded, which does not embrace two 
distinct (either material or intellectual) subjects of 
thought : each of them capable or not of being con* 
ceived by itself, but incapable of being believed by 
itself. 

I may say, for instance, ** the sun." The word 
has a meaning, and suggests that meaning to the 
mind of any one who is listening to me. But suppose 
I ask hun, Whether it is true: whether he believes it? 
He can give no answer. There is as yet nothing to 
believe, or to disbelieve. Now, however, let me 
make, of all possible assertions respecting the sun, 
the one which involves the least of reference to any 
object besides itself; let me say, "the sun exists." 
Here, at once, is something which a person can say he 
believes. But here, instead of only one, we "find two 
distinct objects of conception : the sun, is one object; 
existence, is ^another. Let it not be said, that this 
second conception, existence, is involved in the first ; 
for the sun may be conceived as no longer existing. 
•*The sun*' does not convey all the meaning that is 
conveyed by '^ the sun exists :" '' my father" does not 
include all the meaning of '*my father exists," for

24 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

he may be dead ; ^' a round square" does not include 
the meaning of ** a round square exists," for it does 
not, and cannot exist. When I say, " the sim," " my 
father/* or a ** round square," I call upon the hearer 
for no belief or disbelief, nor can either the one or 
the other be afforded me ; but if I say, ** the sun 
exists," "my father exists," or '*a round square 
exists," I call for belief; and should, in the first of 
the three instances meet with it ; in the second, with 
belief or disbelief, as the case might be ; in the third, 
with disbelief. 

§ 3. This first step in the analysis of the object of 
belief, which, though so obvious, will be found to be 
not unimportant, is the only one which we shall find 
it practicable to make without a preliminary survey of 
language. If we attempt to proceed further in the 
same path, that is, to analyze any further the import 
of Propositions ; we find forced upon us, as a subject 
of previous consideration, the import of Names. For 
every proposition consists of two names ; and every 
proposition affirms or denies one of these names, of 
the other. Now what we do, what passes in our mind, 
when we affirm or deny two names of one another, 
must depend upon what they are names of; since it is 
with reference to that, and not to the mere names 
themselves, that we make the affirmation or denial. 
Here, therefore, we find a new reason why the signifi- 
cation of names, and the relation, generally, between 
names and the things signified by them, must occupy 
the preliminary stage of the inquiry we are engaged in. 

It may be objected, that the meaning of names can 
guide us at most only to the opinions, possibly the 
foolish and groundless opinions, which mankind have 
formed concerning things, and that as the object of

NECBSSITY OF AN ANALYSIS OF NAMES. 25 

philosophy is truth, not opinion, the philosopher 
should dismiss words and look into things themselves, 
to ascertain what questions can be asked and answered 
in regard to them. This advice (which fortunately 
no one has it in his power to follow) is in reality an 
exhortation to discard the whole fruits of the labours 
of his predecessors, and demean himself as if he were 
the first person who had ever turned an inquiring eye 
upon nature. What does any one*s personal know- 
ledge of Things amount to, after subtracting all which 
he has acquired by means of the words of other 
people ? Even after he has learnt as much as men 
usually do learn from others, will the notions of 
things contained in his individual mind afibrd as suffi- 
cient a basis for a catalogue raisonnie as the notions 
which are in the minds of all mankind? 

In any enimieration and classification of Things, 
which does not set out from their names, no varieties 
of things wiU of course be comprehended but those 
recognised by the particular inquirer ; and it will still 
remain for him to establish, by a subsequept exami- 
nation of names, that his enumeration has omitted 
nothing which ought to have been included. But if 
we begin with names, and use them as our clue to the 
things, we bring at once before us all the distinctions 
which have been recognised, not by a single inquirer 
of perhaps limited views, but by the collective intelli- 
gence of mankind. It doubtless may, and I believe 
it will, be found, that mankind have multiplied the 
varieties imnecessarily, and have imagined distinctions 
among things where there were only distinctions in the 
manner of naming them. But we are not entitled to 
assume this in the commencement. We must begin 
by recognising the distinctions made by ordinary lan- 
guage. If some of these appear, on a close examina-

tioD, not to be fundamenta!, our enumeration of the 
different kinds of realities may be abridged accord- 
ingly. But to impose upon the facts in the first 
instance the yoke of a theory, while the grounds of 
the theory are reserved for discussion in a subsequent 
stage, is evidently not a course which a logician can 
reasonably adopt.

Chapter II. 

OF NAMES. 

§ 1. **A NAME,** says Hobbes*, 'Ms a word taken 
at pleasure to serve for a mark, which may raise in 
our mind a thought like to some thought we had 
before, and which being pronounced to others, may 
be to them a sign of what thought the speaker hadf 
before in his mind." This simple definition of a name, 
as a word (or set of words) serving the double pur- 
pose, of a mark to recall to ourselves the likeness of a 
former thought, and a sign to make it known to 
others, appears unexceptionable. Names, indeed, do 
much more than this; but whatever else they do, 
grows out of, and is the result of this : as will appear 
in its proper place. 

Are names more properly said to be the names of 
things, or of our ideas of things ? The first is the 
expression in common use ; the last is that of some 
philosophers, who conceived that in adopting it they 
were introducing a highly important distinction. The 
eminent thinker, just quoted, seems to countenance the 
latter opinion. **But seeing,'* he continues, ^'names 
ordered in speech (as is defined) are signs of our con- 
ceptions, it is manifest they are not signs of the things 
themselves; for that the sound of this word stone 
should be the sign of a stone, cannot be understood

28 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

in any sense but this, that he that hears it collects 
that he that pronounces it thinks of a stone.'' 

If it be merely meant that the conception alone, 
and not the thing itself, is recalled by the name, or 
imparted to the hearer, this of course cannot be denied. 
Nevertheless, there seems good reason for adhering to 
the common usage, and calling the word sun the name 
of the sun, and not the name of our idea of the sun. 
For names are not intended only to make the hearer 
conceive what we conceive, but also to inform him 
what we believe. Now, when I use a name for the 
purpose of expressing a belief, it is a belief concerning 
the thing itself, not concerning my idea of it. When 
I say, '* the sun is the cause of day/' I do not mean 
that my idea of the sun causes or excites in me the 
idea of day; but that the physical object, the sun 
itself, is the cause from which the outward pheno- 
menon, day, follows as an effect. It seems proper to 
consider a word as the name of that which we intend 
to be understood by it when we use it ; of that which 
any fact that we assert of it is to be understood of; 
that, in short, concerning which, when we employ the 
word, we intend to give information. Names, there- 
fore, shall always be spoken of in this work as the 
names of things themselves, and not merely of our 
ideas of things. 

But the question now arises, of what things ? and 
to answer this it is necessary to take into consideration 
the different kinds of names. 

* § 2. It is usual, before examining the various classes 
into which names are commonly divided, to begin by 
distinguishing from names of every description, those 
words which are not names, but only parts of names. 
Among such are reckoned particles, as of, to, truly y

NAMES. 29 

often ; the inflected cases of nouns substantive, as me, 
him, John's*; and even adjectives, as large, he<wy. 
These words do not express things of which anything 
can be affirmed or denied. We cannot say, Heavy 
fell, or A heavy fell ; Truly, or A truly, was asserted; 
Of, or An of, was in the room. Unless, indeed, we 
are speaking of the mere words themselves, as when 
we say, Truly is an English word, or. Heavy is an 
adjective. In that case they are complete names, viz. 
names of those particular sounds, or of those particular 
collections of written characters. This employment 
of a word to denote the mere letters and syllables of 
which it is composed, was termed by the schoolmen 
the suppositio materialis of the word. In any other 
sense, we cannot introduce one of these words into the 
subject of a proposition, unless in combination with 
other words ; as, A heavy body fell, A truly important 
fact was asserted, A member of parliament was in the 
room. 

An adjective, however, is capable of standing by 
itself as the predicate of a proposition ; as when we 
say. Snow is white; and occasionally even as the 
subject, for we may say, White is an agreeable colour. 
The adjective is often said to be so used by a gram- 
matical ellipsis : Snow is white, instead of Snow is a 
white object ; White is an agreeable colour, instead of, 
A white colour, or. The colour of white, is agreeable. 
The Greeks and Romans were permitted, by the rules 
of their language, to employ this ellipsis universally 



? It would, perhaps, be more correct to say that inflected cases 
are names and something more; and that this addition prevents 
them from being used as the subjects of propositions. But the 
purposes of our inquiry do not demand that we should enter with 
scrupulous accuracy into similar minutise.

30 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

in the subject as well as in the predicate of a proposi- 
tion. In English, this cannot, generally speaking, be 
done. We may say, The earth is round; but we 
cannot say, Round is easily moved ; we must say, A 
round object This distinction, however, is rather 
grammatical than logical. Since there is no differ- 
ence of meaning between rounds and a round object, it 
is only custom which prescribes that on any given 
occasion one shall be used, and not the other. We 
shall therefore, without scruple, speak of adjectives as 
names, whether in their own right, or as representa- 
tive of the more circuitous forms of expression above 
exemplified. The other classes of subsidiary words 
have no title whatever to be considered as names. An 
adverb, or an accusative case, cannot under any circum- 
stances (except when their mere letters and syllables 
are spoken oO figure as one of the terms of a proposi- 
tion. 

Words which are not capable of being used as 
names, but only as parts of names, were called by 
some of the schoolmen Syncategorematic terms : from 
o-w^ with, and Koi^openD^ to predicate, because it was 
only with some other word that they could be predi- 
cated. A word which could be used either as the 
subject or predicate of a proposition, without being 
accompanied by any other word, was termed by the 
same authorities a Categorematic term. A combi- 
nation of one or more Categorematic, and one or more 
Syncategorematic words, £^s, A heavy body, or A 
court of justice, they sometimes called a mixed term ; 
but this seems a needless multiplication of technical 
expressions. A mixed term is, in the only useful 
sense of the word, Categorematic. It belongs to the 
class of what have been called many-worded names. 

For, as one word is frequently not a name, but 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 31 

only part of a name, so a number of words often 
compose one single name, and no more. Thus, in 
the opening of the Paradise Lost, these lines, — 



the fruit 



Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste 
Brought death into the world, and all our woe. 
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man 
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat, — 

form in the estimation of the logician only one name ; 
one Categorematic term. A mode of determining 
whether any set of words makes only one name, or 
more than one, is by predicating something of it, and 
observing whether, by this predication, we make only 
one assertion or several. Thus, when we say, John 
Nokes, who was the mayor of the town, died yester- 
day, — ^by this predication we make but one assertion ; 
whence it appears that " John Nokes, who was the 
mayor of the town," is no more than one name. It 
is true that in this proposition, besides the assertion 
that John Nokes died yesterday, there is included 
another assertion, namely, that John Nokes was mayor 
of the town. But this last assertion was already made : 
we did not make it by adding the predicate, *' died 
yesterday." Suppose, however, that the words had 
been, John Nokes, and the mayor of the town, 
they would have formed two names instead of one. 
For when we say, John Nokes and the mayor of the 
town died yesterday, we make two assertions ; one, 
that John Nokes died yesterday ; the other, that the 
mayor of the town died yesterday. 

It being needless to illustrate, at any greater 
length, the subject of many-worded names, we pro- 
ceed to the distinctions which have been established 
among names, not according to the words they are 
composed of, but according to their signification.

32 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

$ 3. All names are names of something, real or ima- 
ginary ; but all things have not names appropriated to 
them individually. For some individual objects we 
require, and consequently have, separate distinguish- 
ing names; there is a mxne for every person, and for 
every remarkable place. Other objects, of which we 
have not occasion to speak so frequently, we do not 
designate by a name of their own ; but when the neces- 
sity arises for naming them, we do so by putting 
together several words, each of which, by itself, might 
be and is used for an indefinite number of other ob- 
jects ; as when I say, this stone: " this" and " stone" 
being, each of them, names that may be used of many 
other objects besides the particular one meant, 
although the only object of which they can both be 
used at the given moment, consistently with their sig- 
nification, may be the one of which I wish to speak. 

Were this the sole purpose for which names, that 
are common to more things than one, could be em- 
ployed ; if they only served, by mutually limiting each 
other, to afibrd a designation for such individual ob- 
jects as have no names of their own ; they could only 
be ranked among contrivances for economizing the 
use of language. But it is evident that this is not 
their sole function. It is by their means that we are 
enabled to assert general propositions ; to affirm or 
deny any predicate of an indefinite number of things 
at once. The distinction, therefore, between general 
names, and individual or singular names, is funda- 
mental ; and may be considered as the first grand 
division of names. 

A general name is familiarly defined, a name 
which is capable of being truly affirmed, in the same 
sense, of each of an indefinite number of things. An 
individual or singular name is a name which is only

NAMES. 33 

capable of being truly affirmed, in the same sense, 
of one thing. 

Thus, man is capable of being truly affirmed of 
John^ Peter, George, and other persons without assign- 
able limits : and it is affirmed of all of them in the 
same sense ; for the word man expresses certain qua- 
lities, and when we predicate it of those persons, we 
assert that they all possess those qualities. But John 
is only capable of being truly affirmed of one single 
person, at least in the same sense. For although 
there are many persons who bear that name, it is not 
conferred upon them to indicate any qualities, or any- 
thing which belongs to them in common ; and cannot 
be said to be affirmed of them in any sense at all, con- 
sequently not in the same sense. '^ The present king 
of England" is also an individual name. For, that 
there never can be more than one person at a time of 
whom it can be truly affirmed, is implied in the mean- 
ing of the words. 

It is not unusual, by way of explaining what is 
meant by a general name, to say that it is the name of 
a class. But this, though a convenient mode of ex- 
pression for some purposes, is objectionable as a defi- 
nition, since it explains the clearer of two things by 
the more obscure. It would be more logical to reverse 
the proposition, and turn it into a definition of the 
word class : ** A class is the indefinite multitude of 
individuals denoted by a general name." 

It is necessary to distinguish general from collect 
tive names. A general name is one which can be pre- 
dicated of each individual of a multitude ; a collec- 
tive name cannot be predicated of each separately, 
but only of all taken together. '* The 76th regiment 
of foot," which is a collective name, is not a general 
but an individual name ; for although it can be pre*- 

V^^' ^- Digitize^by Google 



34 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

dicated of a multitude of individual soldiers taken 
jointly, it cannot be predicated of them severally. 
We may say, Jones is a soldier, and Thompson is a 
soldier, and Smith is a soldier, but we cannot say, 
Jones is the 76th regiment, and Thompson is the 76th 
regiment, and Smith is the 76th regiment. We can 
only say, Jones, and Thompson, and Smith, and 
Brown, and so forth, (enumerating all the soldiers,) 
are the 76th regiment. 

** The 76th regiment" is a collective name, but 
not a general one : *• a regiment" is both a collective 
and a general name. General with respect to all indi- 
vidual regiments, of each of which separately it can 
be affirmed ; collective with respect to the individual 
soldiers, of whom any regiment is composed. 

§ 4. The second general division of names is into 
concrete and abstract. A concrete name is a name 
which stands for a thing ; an abstract name is a name 
which stands for an attribute of a thing. Thus, John, 
the sea, this table, are names of things. White, also, 
is a name of a thing, or rather of things. White- 
ness, again, is the name of a quality or attribute of 
those things. Man is a name of many things ; huma- 
nity is a name of an attribute of those things. Old 
is a name of things ; old age is a name of one of their 
attributes. 

I have used the words concrete and abstract in 
the sense annexed to them by the schoolmen, who, 
notwithstanding the imperfections of their philosophy, 
were unrivalled in the construction of technical lan- 
guage, and whose definitions, in logic at least, though 
they never went more than a little way into the sub- 
ject, have seldom, I think, been altered but to be 
spoiled. A practice, however, has grown up in more

NAMES. 35 

modem times, which, if not introduced by Locke, has 
gained currency chiefly from his example, of applying 
the expression ** abstract name" to all names which 
are the result of abstraction or generalization, and 
consequently to all general names, instead of confining 
it to the names of attributes. The metaphysicians of 
the Condillac school, — whose admiration of Locke, 
passing over the profoundest speculations of that 
truly original genius, usually fastens with peculiar 
eagerness upon his weakest points, — have gone on 
imitating him in this abuse of language, until there 
is now some difficulty in restoring the word to its ori- 
ginal signification. A more wanton alteration in the 
meaning of a word is rarely to be met with ; for the 
expression general namey the exact equivalent of which 
exists in all languages I am acquainted with, was 
already available for the purpose to which ahstract 
has been misappropriated, while the misappropriation 
leaves that important class of words, the names of 
attributes, without any compact distinctive appella- 
tion- The old acceptation, however, has not gone so 
completely out of use, as to deprive those who still 
adhere to it of all chance of being understood. By 
ahstract^ then, I shall always mean the opposite of 
concrete : by an abstract name, the name of an attri- 
bute ; by a concrete name, the name of an object. 

Do abstract names belong to the class of general, 
or to that of singular names? Some of them are 
certainly general. I mean those which are names not 
of one single and definite attribute, but of a class of 
attributes. Such is the word colour j which is a name 
common to whiteness, redness, &c. Such is even the 
word whiteness, in respect of the different shades of 
whiteness to which it is applied in common; the 
word magnitude, in respect of the various degrees of 

Dn^ by Google 



36 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

magnitude and the various dimensions of space ; the 
word weight, in respect of the various degrees of 
weight. Such also is the word attribute itself, the 
common name of all particular attributes. But when 
only one attribute, neither variable in degree nor in 
kind, is designated by the name ; as visibleness ; tan- 
gibleness ; equality ; squareness ; milk whiteness ; then 
the name can hardly be considered general ; for though 
it denotes an attribute of many different objects, the 
attribute itself is always conceived as one, not many. 
The question is, however, of no moment, and perhaps 
the best way of deciding it would be to consider these 
names as neither general nor individual, but to place 
them in a class apart. 

It may be objected to our definition of an abstract 
name, that not only the names which we have called 
abstract, but adjectives, which we have placed in the 
concrete class, are names of attributes; that whitCf 
for example, is as much the name of the colour, as 
whiteness is. But (as before remarked) a word ought 
to be considered as the name of that which we intend 
to be understood by it when we put it to its principal 
use, that is, when we employ it in predication. When 
we say, snow is white, milk is white, linen is white, 
we do not mean it to be understood that snow, or 
linen, or milk, is a colour. We mean that they are 
things having the colour. The reverse is the case 
with the word whiteness ; what we affirm to be white- 
ness is not snow but the colour of snow. Whiteness, 
therefore, is the name of the colour exclusively: 
white is a name of all things whatever having the 
colour; a name, not of the quality whiteness, but of 
every white object. It is true, this name was given 
to all those various objects on account of the quality ; 
and we may therefore say, without impropriety, that 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 37 

the quality forms part of its signification ; but a name 
can only be said to stand for, or to be a name of, the 
things of which it can be predicated. We shall pre- 
sently see that all names which can be said to have 
any signification, all names by applying which to an 
individual we give any information respecting that 
individual, may be said to imply an attribute of some 
sort ; but they are not names of the attribute ; it has 
its own proper abstract name. 

§ 5. This leads us to the consideration of the third 
great division of names, into connotative and non- 
cormotativey the latter sometimes, but improperly, called 
absolute. This is one of the most important distinctions 
which we shall have occasion to point out, and one of 
those which go deepest into the nature of language. 

A non-connotative term is one which signifies a 
subject only, or an attribute only. A connotative 
term is one which denotes a subject and implies an 
attribute. By a subject is here meant anything 
which possesses attributes. Thus John, or London, 
or England, are names which signify a subject only. 
Whiteness, length, virtue, signify an attribute only. 
None of these names, therefore, are connotative. But 
whitCj long^ virtuous^ are connotative. The word 
white, denotes all white things, as snow, paper, the 
foam of the sea, &c., and impUes, or as it was termed 
by the schoolmen^ connotes* , the attribute whiteness. 
The word white is not predicated of the attribute, but 
of the subjects, snow, &c. ; but when we predicate it 
of them we imply, or connote, that the attribute 
whiteness belongs to them. The same may be said

of the other words above cited. Virtuous, for example, 
is the name of a class, which includes Socrates, 
Howard, the man of Ross, and an undefined nimiber 
of other individuals, past, present, and to come. 
These individuals, collectively and severally, can alone 
be said with propriety to be denoted by the word : of 
them alone can it properly be said to be a name. But 
it is a name applied to all of them in consequence of 
an attribute which they possess in common, the attri- 
bute which men have agreed to call virtue. It is 
applied to all beings that are considered to possess this 
attribute ; and to none which are not so considered. 

All concrete general names are connotative. The 
word man^ for example, denotes Peter, Paul, John, 
and an indefinite number of other individuals, of 
whom, taken as a class, it is the name. But it is 
applied to them, because they possess, and to signify 
that they possess, certain attributes. These seem to 
be, corporeity, animal life, rationality, and a certain 
external form, which for distinction we call the 
human. Every existing thing, which possessed all 
these attributes, would be called a man ; and any- 
thing which possessed none of them, or only one, or 
two, or even three of them without the fourth, would 
not be so called. For example, if in the interior of 
Africa there .were to be discovered a race of animals 
possessing reason equal to that of human beings, but 
with the form of an elephant, they would not be called 
men. Swift's Houyhnhms were not so called. Or 
if such newly-discovered beings possessed the form of 
man without any vestige of reason, it is probable that 
some other name than that of man would be found 
for them. How it happens that there can be any 
doubt about the matter, will appear hereafter. The 
word man, therefore, signifies all these attributes, and 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 39 

all subjects which possess these attributes. But it 
can be predicated only of the subjects. What we call 
men, are the subjects, the individual Stiles and Nokes; 
not the qualities by which their humanity is consti- 
tuted. The name, therefore, is said to signify the 
subjects directly^ the attributes indirectly; it denotes 
the subjects, and implies, or involves, or indicates, or 
as we shall say henceforth, connotes^ the attributes. It 
is a connotative name. 

Connotative names have hence been also called 
denominative, because the subject which they denote is 
denominated by, or receives a name from, the attri- 
bute which they connote. Snow, and other objects, 
receive the name white, because they possess the 
attribute which is called whiteness; James and Ro- 
bert receive the name man, because they possess the 
attributes which are considered to constitute humanity. 
The attribute, or attributes, may therefore be said to 
denominate those objects, or to give them a common 
name. 

It has been seen that all concrete general names 
are connotative. Even abstract names, though the 
names only of attributes, may in some instances be 
justly considered as connotative ; for attributes them- 
selves may have attributes ascribed to them ; and a 
word which denotes attributes may comK)te an attri- 
bute of those attributes. It is thus, for example, 
with such a word as fault; equivalent to bad or 
hurtful quality. This word is a name common to 
many attributes, and connotes hurtfiilness, an attribute 
of those various attributes. When, for example, we 
say that slowness, in a horse, is a fault, we do not 
mean that the slow movement, the actual change of 
place of the slow horse, has any mischievous effects, 
but that the property or peculiarity of the horse, from 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



40 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

which it derives that name, the quality of being a slow 
mover, is an undesirable peculiarity. 

In regard to those concrete names which are not 
general but individual, a distinction must be made. 

Proper names are not connotative : they denote 
the individuals who are called by them ; but they do 
not indicate or imply any attributes as belonging to 
those individuals. When we name a child by the 
name Mary> or a dog by the name Caesar^ these names 
are simply marks used to enable those individuals to 
be made subjects of discourse. It may be said, 
indeed, that we must have had some reason for giving 
them those names rather than any others : and this is 
true; but the name, once given, becomes independent 
of the reason. A man may have been named John 
because that was the name of his father ; a town may 
have been named Dartmouth, because it is situated at 
the mouth of the Dart. But it is no part of the 
signification of the word John, that the father of the 
person so called bore the same name ; nor even of the 
word Dartmouth, to be situated at the mouth of the 
Dart. If sand should choke up the mouth of the 
river, or an earthquake change its course, and remove 
it to a distance from the town, there is no reason to 
think that the name of the town would be changed. 
That fact, therefore, can form no part of the significa- 
tion of the word ; for otherwise, when the fact ceased 
to be true, the name would cease to be applied. 
Proper names are attached to the objects themselves, 
and are not dependent upon the continuance of any 
attribute of the object. 

But there is another kind of names, which, 
although they are individual names, that is, predi- 
cable only of one object, are really connotative. For, 
although we may give to an individual a name utterly 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 41 

unmeaning, which we call a proper name, — a word 
which answers the purpose of showing what thing it 
is we are talking about, but not of telling anything 
about it ; yet a name peculiar to an individual is not 
necessarily of this description. It may be significant 
of some attribute^ or some union of attributes, which 
being possessed by no object but one, determines the 
name exclusively to that individual. "The stm'' is 
a name of this description ; " God,'* when used by a 
Christian, is another. These, however, are scarcely 
examples of what we are now attempting to illustrate, 
beings in strictness of language, general, and not 
individual names : for, however they may be in fact 
predicable only of one object, there is nothing in the 
meaning of the words themselves which implies this : 
and, accordingly, when we are imagining and not 
affirming, we may speak of many suns; and the 
majority of mankind have believed, and still believe, 
that there are many gods. But it is easy to produce 
words which are real instances of connotative indi- 
vidual names. It may be part of the meaning of the 
connotative name itself, that there exists but one 
individual possessing the attribute which it connotes ; 
as, for instance, ** the only son of John Stiles ;'* " the 
Jirst emperor of Rome.'* Or the attribute connoted 
may be a connexion with some determinate event, and 
the connexion may be of such a kind as only one 
individual could have; or may at least be such as only 
one individual actually had ; and this may be implied 
in the form of the expression. ** The father of So- 
crates," is an example of the one kind (since Socrates 
could not have had two fathers) ; " the author of the 
Iliad,** *Uhe murderer of Henri Quatre,'* of the 
second. For, although it is conceivable that more 
persons than one might have participated in the

authorship of the Iliad, or in the murder of H^iri 
Quatre, the employment of the article the implies 
that, in fact, this was not the case. What is here 
done by the word the, is done in other cases by the 
context: thus, " Caesar's army** is an individual name, 
if it appears from the context, that the army meant is 
that which Caesar commanded in a particular battle. 
The still more general expressions, ''the Roman 
army,** or "the Christian army,*' may be indivi- 
dualized in a similar manner. Another case of 
frequent occurrence has already been noticed; it is 
the following. The name, being a many-worded one, 
may consist, in 'the first place, of a general name, 
capable therefore in itself of being affirmed of more 
things than one, but which is, in the second place, so 
limited by other words joined with it, that the entire 
expression can only be predicated of one object, con- 
sistently with the meaning of the general term. This 
is exemplified in such an instance as the following : 
**the present prime minister of En^and.** Prime 
Minister of England is a general name ; the attributes 
which it connotes may be possessed by an indefinite 
mmiber of persons : in succession however, not 
simultaneously ; since the meaning of the word itself 
imports (among other things) that there can be only 
one such person at a time. This being the case, and 
the application of the name being afterwards limited 
by tlie word present, to such individuals as possess 
the attributes at one indivisible point of time, it 
becomes appUcable only to one individual. And 
as this appears from the meaning of the name, 
without any extrinsic proof, it is strictly an individual 
name. -- 

From the preceding observations it will easily be 
collected, that whenever the names given to objects 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 43 

convey any information, that is, whenever they have 
properly any meaning, the meaning resides not in | 
what they denotCy but in what they connote. The 
only names of objects which connote nothing are 
proper names ; and these have, strictly speaking, no 
signification. 

If, like the robber in the Arabian Nights, we make 
a mark with chalk upon a house to enable us to know 
it again, the mark has a purpose, but it has not pro- 
perly any meaning. The chalk does not declare any- 
thing about the house ; it does not mean. This is such 
a person's house, or This is a house which contains 
booty. The object of making the mark is merely 
distinction. I say to myself. All these houses are so 
nearly alike, that if I lose sight of them I shall not 
again be able to distinguish that which I am now 
looking at, from any of the others ; I must therefore 
contrive to make the appearance of this one house 
unlike that of the others, that I may hereafter know, 
when I see the mark — ^not indeed any attribute of the 
house — ^but simply that it is the same house which I 
am now looking at. Morgiana chalked all the other 
bouses in a similar manner, and defeated the scheme : 
how? simply by obliterating the difference of ap- 
pearance between that house and the others. The 
chalk was still there, but it no longer served the 
purpose of a distinctive mark. 

When we impose a proper name, we perform an 
operation in some degree analogous to what the robber 
intended in chalking the house. We put a mark, not 
indeed upon the object itself^ but, if I may so speak, 
upon the idea of the object. A proper name is but 
an unmeaning mark which we connect in our minds 
with the idea of the object, in order that whenever 
the mark meets our eyes or occurs to our thoughts. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



44 NAMJJS AND PROPOSITIONS. 

we may think of that individual object. Not being 
attached to the thing itself, it does not enable us, as 
the chalk did, to distinguish the object when we see 
it; but it enables us to distinguish it when it is 
spoken of, either in the records of our own experience, 
or in the discourse of others ; to know that what we 
find asserted in any proposition of which it is the 
subject, is asserted of the individual thing with which 
we were previously acquainted. 

When we predicate of anything its proper name ; 
when we say, pointing to a man, this is Brown or- 
Smith, or pointing to a city, that it is York, we do 
not, merely by so doing, convey to the hearer any 
information about them, except that those are their 
names. By enabling him to identify the individuals, 
we may connect them with iilformation previously 
possessed by him ; by saying, This is York, we may 
tell him that it contains the Minster. But this is in 
virtue of what he has previously heard concerning 
York ; not by anything implied in the name. It is 
otherwise when objects are spoken of by connotative 
names. When we say. The town is built of marble, 
we give the hearer what may be entirely new informa- 
tion, and this merely by the signification of the many- 
worded connotative name, ** built of marble." Such 
names are not signs of the mere objects, invented 
because we have occasion to think and speak of those 
objects individually ; but signs which accompany an 
attribute: a kind of Uvery in which the attribute 
clothes all objects which are recognised as possessing 
it. They are not mere marks, but more, that is to 
say, significant marks ; and the connotation is what 
constitutes their significance. 

As a proper name is said to be the name of the 
one individual which it is predicated of, so (as well

from the importance of adhering to analogy, as for the 
other reasons formerly assigned) a connotative name 
ought to be considered a name of all the various indi- 
viduals which it is predicable of, or in other words 
denotes, and not of what it connotes. But by learning 
what things it is a name of, we do not learn the 
meaning of the name : for to the same thing we may, 
with equal propriety, apply many names, not equiva- 
lent in meaning. Thus, I call a certain man by the 
name Sophroniscus : I call him by another name, 
•The father of Socrates. Both these are names of the 
same individual, but their meaning is altogether 
different ; they are applied to that individual for two 
different purposes; the one, merely to distinguish 
him from other persons who are spoken of; the other, 
to indicate a fact relating to him, the fact that 
Socrates was his son. I further apply to him these 
other expressions : a man, a Greek, an Athenian, a 
sculptor, an old man, an honest man, a brave man. 
All these are names of Sophroniscus, not indeed of him 
alone, but of him and each of an indefinite number of 
other human beings. Each of these names is applied 
to Sophroniscus for a different reason, and by each 
whoever understands its meaning is apprised of a dis- 
tinct fact or number of facts concerning him; but 
those who knew nothing about the names except that 
they were appUcable to Sophroniscus, would be alto- 
gether ignorant of their meaning. It is even conceiv- 
able that I might know every single individual of 
whom a given name could be with truth affirmed, 
and yet could not be said to know the meaning of the 
name. A child knows who are its brothers and 
sisters, long before it has any definite conception of 
the nature of the facts which are involved in the 
signification of those words.

In some cases it is not easy to decide precisely 
how much a particular word does or does not connote; 
that is, we do not exactly know (the case not having 
arisen) what degree of diflFerence in the object would 
occasion a difference in the name. Thus, it is clear 
that the word man^ besides animal life and rationality, 
connotes also a certain external form ; but it would 
be impossible to say precisely what form ; that is, to 
decide how great a deviation from the form ordinarily 
found in the beings whom we are accustomed to call 
men, would suffice in a newly-discovered race to make- 
us refuse them the name of man. Rationality, also, 
being a quality which admits of degrees, it has never 
been settled what is the lowest degree of that quality 
which would entitle any creature to be considered a 
human being. In all such cases, the meaning of the 
general name is so far unsettled, and vague ; mankind 
have not come to any positive agreement about the 
matter. When we come to treat of classification, we 
shall have occasion to show under what conditions 
this vagueness may exist without practical inconve- 
nience ; and cases will appear, in which the ends of 
language are better promoted by it than by complete 
precision ; in order that, in natural history, for 
instance^ individuals or species of no very marked 
character may be ranged with those more strongly 
characterized individuals or species to which, in all 
their properties taken together, they bear the nearest 
resemblance. 

But this partial uncertainty in the connotation of 
names can only be free from mischief when guarded 
by strict precautions. One of the chief sources, 
indeed, of lax habits of thought, is the custom of using 
connotative terms without a distinctly ascertained 
connotation, and with no more precise notion of 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



NAMES. 47 

their meaning than can be loosely collected from 
observing what objects they are used to denote. It is 
in this manner that we all acquire, and inevitably so, 
our first knowledge of our vernacular language. A 
diild learns the meaning of the words mauy or whitCy 
by hearing them applied to a variety of individual 
objects, and finding out, by a process of generaliza- 
tion and analysis of which he is but imperfectly con- 
scious, what those different objects have in common. 
In the case of these two words the process is so 
easy as to require no assistance from culture; the 
objects called human beings, and the objects called 
white, differing from all others by qualities of a 
peculiarly definite and obvious character. But in 
many other cases, objects bear a general resemblance 
to one another, which leads to their being familiarly 
classed together under a common name, while, 
without more analytic habits than the generality 
of mankind possess, it is not immediately apparent 
what are the particular attributes, upon the posses- 
sion of which in conmion by them all, their general 
resemblance depends. When this is the case, men 
use the name without any recognized connotation, 
that is, without any precise meaning; they talk, 
and consequently think, vaguely, and remain con- 
tented to attach only the same degree of significance 
to their own words, which a child three years old 
attaches to the words brother and sister. The child 
at least is seldom puzzled by the starting up of new 
individuals, on whom he is ignorant whether or not 
to confer the title; because there is usually an 
authority close at hand competent to solve all doubts. 
But a similar resource does not exist in the generality 
of cases ; and new objects are continually presenting 
themselves to men, women, and children, which they

48 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

are called upon to class propria motu. They, accord^, 
ingly, do this on no other principle than that of 
superficial similarity, giving to each new object the 
name of that familiar object, the idea of which it most 
readily recalls ; or which, on a cursory inspection, it 
seems to them most to resemble : as an unknown 
substance found in the ground will be called, accord- 
ing to its texture, earth, sand, or a stone. In this 
manner, names creep on from subject to subject, until 
all traces of a common meaning sometimes disappear, 
and the word comes to denote a number of things not 
only independently of any common attribute, but 
which have actually no attribute in common ; or none 
but what is shared by other things to which tlie name 
is capriciously refused*. Even philosophers have 
aided in this perversion of general language from its 
purpose; sometimes because, like the vulgar, they 
knew no better; and sometimes in deference to that 
aversion to admit new words, which induces mankind, 
on all subjects not considered technical, to attempt to 
make the original small stock of names serve with 



* It would be well if this natural degeneracy of language took 
place only in the hands of the ignorant vulgar ; but some of the 
most remarkable instances are to be found in terms of art, and 
among technically educated persons, such as English lawyers. 
Fehny^ for example, is a law term, with the sound of which all 
ears are familiar ; but there is no lawyer who would undertake to 
tell what a felony is, otherwise than by enumerating the various 
kinds of offences which are so called. Originally the word felony 
had a meaning; it denoted all offences, the penalty of which 
included forfeiture of goods; but subsequent acts of parliament 
have declared various offences to be felonies without enjoining that 
penalty, and have taken away the penalty from others which 
continue nevertheless to be called felonies, insomuch that the acts 
so called have now no property whatever in common, save that of 
being unlawful and punishable.

but little augmentation to express a constantly in- 
creasing number of objects and distinctions, and, 
consequently, to express them in a manner progres- 
sively more and more imperfect. 

To what degree this loose mode of classing and 
denominating objects has rendered the vocabulary of 
mental and moral philosophy unfit for the purposes of 
accurate thinking, is best known to whoever has 
most reflected on the present condition of those 
branches of knowledge. Since, however, the intro- 
duction of a new technical language as the vehicle of 
speculations on moral subjects would not, in this 
country at least, be tolerated, and if tolerated, would 
deprive those subjects of the benefit of the habitual 
feelings, which have grown round the established 
phrases and Jthe recognised groups, and which would 
not for a long time take an equally strqng hold of 
new ones ; the problem for the philosopher, and one 
of the most difficult which he has to resolve, is^ in 
retaining the existing phraseology, how best to 
alleviate its imperfections. This can only be accom- 
plished by giving to every general concrete name 
which he has frequent occasion to predicate, a definite 
and fixed connotation ; in order that it may be known 
what attributes, when we call an object by that name, 
we really mean to predicate of the object. And the 
question of most nicety is, how to give this fixed 
connotation to a name, with the least possible change 
in the objects which the name is habitually employed 
to denote ; with the least possible disarrangement, 
either by adding or subtraction, of the group of 
objects which it serves, in however imperfect a man- 
ner, to circumscribe and hold together; and with the 
least vitiation of the truth of any propositions which 
are commonly received as true.

This desirable purpose, of giving a fixed connota- 
tion where it is wanting, is the end aimed at whenever 
any one attempts to give a definition of a general 
name already in use; every definition of a coimotative 
name being an attempt either merely to declare, or to 
declare and analyze, the connotation of the name. 
And the fact, that no questions which have arisen in 
the moral sciences have been subjects of keener 
controversy than the definitions of almost all the 
leading expressions, is a proof how great an extent 
the evil, to which we have adverted, has attained. 

Names with indeterminate connotation are not 
to be confounded with names which have more than 
one connotation, that is to say, with ambiguous words. 
A word may have several meanings, but all of them 
fixed and recognised ones; as the word post, for 
example, or the word box, the various senses of 
which it would be endless to enumerate. And the 
paucity of existing names, in comparison with the 
demand for them, may often render it advisable and 
even necessary to retain a name in this multiplicity 
of. acceptations, distinguishing these so clearly as to 
prevent their being confounded with one another. 
Such a word may be considered as two or more 
names, accidentally written and spoken alike*. 



* Before quitting the subject of connotative names, it is proper 
to observe, that the only recent writer who, to my knowledge, has 
adopted from the schoolmen the word to connote, Mr. Mill, in 
his Andlyns of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, employs it 
in a signification different from that in which it is here used. 
He uses the word in a sense coextensive with its etymology, 
applying it to every case in which a name, while pointing directly 
to one thing, (which is, consequently, termed its signification,) 
includes also a tacit reference to some other thing. In the case 
considered in the text, that of concrete general names, his language

and mine are the converse of one another. Considering (very 
justly) the signification of the name to lie in the attribute, he 
speaks of the word as noting the attribute, and eannoling the things 
possessing the attribute. And he describes abstract names as 
being properly concrete names with their connotation dropped : 
whereas, in my view, it is the (ilmotation which would be said 
to be dropped, what was previously connoted becoming the whole 
signification. 

In adopting a phraseology at variance with that which so high 
an authority, and one which I am less likely than any other 
person to undervalue, has deliberately sanctioned, I have been influ- 
enced by the urgent necessity for a term exclusively appropriated 
to express the manner in which a concrete general name serves 
to mark the attributes which are involved in its signification. This 
necessity can scarcely be felt in its full force by any one who 
has not found by experience, how vain is the attempt to commu- 
nicate clear ideas on the philosophy of language without such a 
word. It is hardly an exaggeration to say, that some of the most 
prevalent of the errors with which logic has been infected, and a 
large part of the cloudiness and confusion of ideas which have enve- 
loped it, would, in all probability, have been avoided, if a term had 
been in common use to express exactly what I have signified by 
the term to connote. And the schoolmen, to whom we are indebted 
for the greater part of our logical language, gave us this also, and 
in this very sense. For, although some of their general expressions 
countenance the use of the word in the more extensive and vague 
acceptation in which it is taken by Mr. Mill, yet when they had to 
define it specifically as a technical term, and to fix its meaning as 
such, with that admirable precision which always characterized 
their definitions, they clearly explained that nothing was said to be 
connoted except />rm#, which word may generally, in their writings, 
be understood as synonymous with attributet. 

Now, if the word to connote, so well suited to the purpose to 
which they applied it, be diverted from that purpose by being 
taken to fulfil another, for which it does not seem to me to be at 
all required ; I am unable to find any expression to replace it,* but 
such as are commonly employed in a sense so much more general, 
that it would be useless attempting to associate them peculiarly 
with this precise idea. Such are the words, to involve, to imply,

good; negative, as not-many noUtree, not-good. To 
every positive concrete name, a corresponding negative 
one might be framed. After giving a name to any 
one thing, or to any plurality of things, we might 
create a second name which should be a name of all 
things whatever except that particular thing or things. 
These negative names are employed whenever we have 
occasion to speak collectively of all things other than 
some thing or class of things. When the positive 
name is connotative, the corresponding negative 
name is connotative likewise ; but in a peculiar way, 
connoting not the presence but the absence of an 
attribute. Thus, not-white denotes all things what- 
ever except white things ; and connotes the attribute 
of not possessing whiteness. For the non-possession 
of any given attribute is also an attribute, and may 
receive a name as such ; and thus negative concrete 
names may obtain negative abstract names to corre- 
spond to them. 

Names which are positive in form are often 
negative in reality, and others are really positive 
though their form is negative. The word inconvenienty 
for example, does not express the mere absence of 
convenience ; it expresses a positive attribute, that of 
being the cause of discomfort or annoyance. So the 
word unpleasant^ notwithstanding its negative form, 
does not connote the mere absence of pleasantness, 
but a less degree of what is signified by the word 
painful ywh\chy it is hardly necessary to say, is positive. 



&c. By employing these, I should fail of attaining the object for 
which alone the name is needed, namely, to distinguish this 
particular kind of involving and implying from all other kinds, and 
to assure to it the degree of habitual attention which its import- 
ance demands.

IdUy on the other hand, is a word which, though

drunk or by not drunken. 

There is a class of names called privative. A 
privative name is equivalent in its signification to a 
positive and a negative name taken together ; being 
the name of something which has once had a par- 
ticular attribute, or for some other reason might ha\re 
been expected to have it, but which has it not. Such 
is the word blind, which is not equivalent to not seeing, 
or to not capable of seeing, for it would not, except by 
a poetical or rhetorical figure, be appUed to stocks and 
stones. A thing is not usually said to be blind, unless 
the class to which it is most familiarly referred, or to 
which it is referred on the particular occasion, be 
chiefly composed of things which can see, as in the 
case of a blind man, or a blind horse ; or unless it is 
supposed for any reason that it ought to see; as in 
saying of a man, that he rushed blindly into an abyss, 
or of philosophers or the clergy that the greater part 
of them are blind guides. The names called privative, 
therefore, connote two things : the absence of certain 
attributes, and the presence of others, from which the 
presence also of the former might naturally have been 
expected. 

§ 7. The fifth leading division of names is into 
relative and absolute^ or let us rather say, relative and 
non-relative ; for the word absolute is put upon much 
too hard duty in metaphysics, not to be willingly 
spared when its services can be dispensed with. It 
resembles the word dvil in the language of juris- 
prudence, which stands for the opposite of criminal,

54 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

the opposite of ecclesiastical, the opposite of military, 
the opposite of political, in short, the opposite of any 
positive word which wants a negative. 

Relative names are such as father, son; ruler, 
subject; like; equal; unlike; unequal; longer, shorter; 
cause, effect. Their characteristic property is, that 
they are always given in pairs. Every relative name 
which is predicated of an object, supposes another 
object (or objects), of which we may predicate either 
that same name or another relative name which is 
said to be the correlative of the former. Thus, when 
we call any person a son, we suppose other persons 
who must be called parents. When we call any event 
a cause, we suppose another event which is an effect. 
When we say of any distance that it is longer, we 
suppose another distance which is shorter. When we 
say of any object that it is like, we mean that it is 
like some other object, which is also said to be like 
the first. In this case, both objects receive the same 
name ; the relative term is its own correlative. 

It is evident that these words, when concrete, are, 
like other concrete general names, connotative : they 
denote a subject, and connote an attribute : and each 
of them has or might have a corresponding abstract 
name to denote the attribute connoted by the concrete. 
Thus the concrete like has its abstract likeness; the 
concretes, £Either and son, have the abstracts, paternity 
and filiation. The concrete name connotes an attri- 
bute, and the abstract name which answers to it 
denotes that attribute. But of what nature is the 
attribute? Wherein consists the peculiarity in the 
connotation of a relative name ? 

The attribute signified by a relative name, say 
some, is a relation ; and this they give, if not as a 
sufficient explanation, at least as the only one attain-

able. If they are asked. What then is a relation? 
they do not profess to be able to tell. It is generally 
regarded as something peculiarly recondite and mys- 
terious. I cannot, however, perceive in what respect 
it is more so than any other attribute; indeed, it 
appears to me to be so in a somewhat less degree. I 
conceive, rather, that it is by examining into the 
signification of relative names, or in other words, 
into the nature of the attribute which they connote, 
that a clear insight may best be obtained into the 
nature of all attributes ; of all that is meant by an 
attribute. 

It is obvious, in fact, that if we take any two 
correlative names, father and son^ for instance, 
although the objects c2enoted by the names are dif- 
ferent, they both, in a certain sense, connote the same 
thing. They cannot, indeed, be said to connote the 
same attribute ; to be a father, is not the same thing 
as to be a son. But when we caU one man a father, 
another his son, what we mean to affirm is a set of 
facts, which are exactly the same in both cases. To 
predicate of A that he is the father of B, and of B 
that he is the son of A, is to assert one and the same 
fact in different words. The two propositions are 
exactly equivalent : neither of them asserts more or 
asserts less than the other. The paternity of A and 
the filiation of B are not two facts, but two modes 
of expressing the same fact* That fact, when ana- 
lyzed, consists of a series of physical events or phe- 
nomena, in which both A and B are parties concerned, 
and from which they both derive names. What those 
names really connote, is this series of events : that is 
the meaning, and the whole meaning, which either of 
them is intended to convey. The series of events 
may be said to constitute the relation ; the schoolmen

56 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

called it the foundation of the relation, fundamentum 
relationis. 

In this manner any fact, or series of facts, in which 
two different objects are implicated, and which is 
therefore predicable of both of them, may be either 
considered as constituting an attribute of the one, or 
an attribute of the other. According as we consider 
it in the former, or in the latter aspect, it is connoted 
by the one or the other of the two correlative names. 
Father connotes the fact, regarded as constituting an 
attribute of A : son t;onnotes the same fact, as con- 
stituting an attribute of B. It may evidently be 
regarded with equal propriety in either light. And all 
that appears necessary to account for the existence of 
relative names, is, that whenever there is a fact, in 
which two individuals are alike concerned, an attribute 
grounded on that fact may be ascribed to either of 
these individuals. 

A name, therefore, is said to be relative, when, over 
and above the object which it denotes, it implies in 
its signification the existence of another object, also 
deriving a denomination from the same fact which is 
the ground of the first name. Or (to express the 
same meaning in other words) a name is relative, when, 
being the name of one thing, its signification cannot 
be explained but by mentioning another. Or we may 
state it thus : — ^when the name cannot be employed 
in discourse, so as to have a meaning, unless the 
name of some other thing than what it is itself the 
name of, be either expressed or understood. We 
may take our choice among these definitions. They 
are all, at bottom, equivalent, being modes of 
variously expressing this one distinctive circum- 
stance — that every other attribute of an object might, 
without any contradiction, be conceived still to exist

if all objects besides that one were annihilated*; 
but those of its attributes, which are expressed by 
relative names, would on that supposition be swept 
away. 

§ 8. Names have been further distinguished into 
univocal and (equivocal : these, however, are not two 
kinds of names, but two dilBerent modes of employing 
names. A name is univocal, or applied univocally, 
with respect to all things of which it can be predicated 
in the same sense; but it is aequivocal, or applied aequi- 
vocally, as respects those things of which it is predi- 
cated in different senses. It is scarcely necessary to 
give instances of a fact so familiar as the double 
meaning of a word. In reality, as has been already 
observed, an aequivocal or ambiguous word is not one 
name, but two names, accidentally coinciding in sound. 
File standing for an iron instrument, and file standing 
for a line of soldiers^ have no more title to be con- 
sidered one word, because written alike, than grease 
and Greece have, because they are pronoimced alike. 
They are one sound, appropriated to form two different 
words. 

An intermediate case is that of a name used ana^ 
logically or metaphorically ; that is, a name which is 
predicated of two things, not univocally, or exactly 
in the same signification, but in significations some- 
what similar, and which being derived one from the 
other, one of them may be considered the primary, 
and the other a secondary signification. As when we 
speak of a brilliant light, and a brilliant achievement. 



? Or rather all objects, except itself and the percipient mind 
for, as we shall see hereafter, to ascribe any attribute to an object 
necessarily implies a mind to perceive it.

The word is not applied in the same sense to the light 
and to the achievement ; but having been applied to 
the light in its original sense^ that of brightness to the 
eye, it is transferred to the achievement in a deriva- 
tive signification, supposed to be somewhat like the 
primitive one. The word, however, is just as pro- 
perly two names instead of one, in this case, as in 
that of the most perfect ambiguity. And one of the 
commonest forms of fallacious reasoning arising from 
ambiguity, is that of arguing from a metaphorical 
expression as if it were literal ; that is, as if a word, 
when applied metaphorically, were the same name 
as when taken in its original sense: which will be 
seen more particularly in its place.

Chapter III. 

OF THE THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 

§ 1. Looking back now to the commeacement of 

our inquiry, let us attempt to measure how far it has 

advanced. Logic, we found, is the Theory of Proof. 

But proof supposes something provable, which must 

be a Proposition or Assertion ; since nothing but a 

Proposition can be an object of belief, or therefore 

of proof. A Proposition is, discourse which affirms 

or denies something of some other thing. This is one 

step : there must, it seems, be two things concerned 

in every act of belief. But what are these Things ? 

They can be no other than those signified by the two 

names, which being joined together by a copula con- 

stitute the Proposition. If, therefore, we knew what 

all Names signiiy, we should know everything which 

is capable either of being made a subject of affirmation 

or denial, or of being itself affirmed or denied of a 

subject. We have accordingly, in the preceding 

chapter, reviewed the various kinds of Names, in 

order to ascertain what is signified by each of them. 

And we have now carried this survey far enough to 

be able to take an account of its results, and to exhibit 

an enumeration of all the kinds of Things which are 

capable of being made predicates, or of having any- 

thing predicated of them : after which to determine 

the import of Predication, that is, of Propositions, can 

be no arduous task. 

The necessity of an enumeration of Existences, as 
the basis of Logic, did not escape the attention of the 
schoolmen, and of their master, Aristotle, the most

comprehensive, if not the most sagacious, of the 
ancient philosophers. The Categories, or Predica- 
ments — the former a Greek word, the latter its literal 
translation in the Latin language— were intended by 
him and his followers as an enumeration of all things 
capable of being named ; an enumeration by the 
summa genera^ i. e. the most extensive classes into 
which things could be distributed ; which, therefore, 
were so many highest Predicates, one or other of 
which was supposed capable of being affirmed with 
truth of every nameable thing whatsoever. The follow- 
ing are the classes into which, according to this school 
of philosophy, Things in general might be reduced: —

The imperfections of this classification are too 
obvious to require, and its merits are not sufficient to 
reward, a minute examination. It is a mere cata- 
logue of the distinctions rudely marked out by the 
language of familiar life, with little or no attempt to 
penetrate, by philosophic analysis, to the rationale 
even of those common distinctions. Such an ana- 
lysis, however superficially conducted, would have 
shown the enumeration to be both redundant and 
defective. Some objects are omitted, and others re- 
peated several times under dififerent heads. It is like 
a division of animals into men, quadrupeds, horses, 
asses, and ponies. That, for instance, could not be

a very comprehensive view of the nature of Relation 
which could exclude action, passivity, and local situa- 
tion from that category. The same observation 
applies to the categories Quando (or position in time) , 
and Ubi (or position in space) ; while the distinction 
between the latter and Situs is merely verbal. The 
incongruity of erecting into a mmmum genus the class 
which forms the tenth category is manifest. On the 
other hand, the enumeration takes no notice of any- 
thing besides substances and attributes. In what 
category are we to place sensations, or any other feel- 
ings, and states of mind ; as hope, joy, fear ; sound, 
smell, taste ; pain, pleasure ; thought, judgment, con- 
ception, and the like ? Probably all these would have 
been placed by the Aristotelian school in the catego- 
ries of actio and passio ; and the relation of such of 
them as are active, to their objects, and of such of 
them as are passive, to their causes, would rightly be 
so placed ; but the things themselves, the feelings or 
states of mind, wrongly. Feelings, or states of con- 
sciousness, are assuredly to be counted among reali- 
ties, but they cannot be reckoned either among sub- 
stances or attributes. 

§ 2. Before recommencing, imder better auspices, 
the attempt made with such imperfect success by the 
great founder of the science of logic, we must take 
notice of an unfortunate ambiguity in all the concrete 
names which correspond to the most general of all 
abstract terms, the word Existence. When we have 
occasion for a name which shall be capable of de- 
noting whatever exists, as contradistinguished from 
non-entity or Nothing, there is hardly a word appli- 
cable to the purpose which is not also, and even more 
fiEtmiliarly, taken in a sense in which it denotes only

62 NAMBS AND PROPOSITIONS. 

substances. But substances are not all tbat exist ; 
attributes, if such things are to be spoken of, must 
be said to exist ; feeUngs also exist. Yet when we 
speak of an object ^ or of a things we are almost always 
supposed to mean a substance. There seems a kind 
of contradiction in using such an expression as that 
one thing is merely an attribute of another thing. 
And the annotincement of a Classification of Things 
would, I believe, prepare most readers for an enume- 
ration like those in natural history, beginning with the 
great divisions of animal, vegetable, and mineral, and 
subdividing them into classes and orders. If, reject- 
ing the word Thing, we endeavom* to find another of 
a more general import, or at least more exclusively 
confined to that general import, a word denoting all 
that exists, and connoting only simple existence ; no 
word might be presumed fitter for such a purpose than 
being : originally the present participle of a verb which 
in one of its meanings is exactly equivalent to the 
verb esnst ; and therefore suitable, even by its gram- 
matical formation, to be the concrete of the abstract 
existence. But this word, strange as the fact may 
appear, is still more completely spoiled for the pur- 
pose which it seemed expressly made for, than the 
word Thing. Being is, by custom, exactly synony- 
mous with substance; except that it is free from a 
slight taint of a second ambiguity ; being applied im- 
partially to matter and to mind, while substance, 
though originally and in strictness applicable to both, 
is apt to suggest in preference the idea of matter. 
Attributes are never called Beings ; nor are Feehngs. 
A Being is that which excites feelings, and which 
possesses attributes. The soul is called a Being; 
God and angels are called Beings ; but if we were to 
say, extension, colour, wisdom, virtue are beings, we

should perhaps be suspected of thinking with some of 
the ancients, that the cardinal virtues are animftlfl ; or, 
at the least, of holding with the Platonic school the 
doctrine of self-existent Ideas, or with the followers of 
Epicurus that of Sensible Forms, which detach them- 
selves in every direction from bodies, and by coming 
in contact with our organs, cause our perceptions. 
We should be supposed, in short, to believe that 
Attributes are Substances. 

In consequence of this perversion of the word 
Being, philosophers looking about for something to 
supply its place, laid their hands upon the word 
Entity, a piece of barbarous Latin, invented by the 
schoolmen to be used as an abstract name, in which 
class its grammatical form would seem to place it; but 
being seized by logicians in distress to stop a leak in 
their terminology, it has ever since been used as a 
concrete name. The kindred word essence^ bom at 
the same time, and of the same parents, scarcely 
imderwent a more complete transformation when, 
from being the abstract of the verb to he, it came to 
denote something sufficiently concrete to be inclosed 
in a glass bottle. The word Entity, since it settled 
down into a concrete name, has retained its univer- 
sality of signification somewhat less unimpaired than 
any of the names before mentioned. Yet the same 
gradual decay to which, after a certain age, all the 
language of psychology seems liable, has been at 
work even here. If you call virtue an entityj you are 
indeed somewhat less strongly suspected of believing 
it to be a substance than if you called it a being ; but 
you are by no means free from the suspicion. Every 
word which was originally intended to connote mere 
existence, seems, after a time, to enlarge its connota- 
tion to separate existence, or existence freed from the

64 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

condition of belonging to a substance; which con- 
dition being precisely what constitutes an attribute, 
attributes are gradually shut out, and along with them 
feelings, which, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, 
have no other name than that of the attribute which 
is grounded upon them. Strange that when the 
greatest embarrassment felt by all who have any con- 
siderable number of thoughts to express, is to find a 
sufficient variety of words fitted to express them, 
thiere should be no practice to which even philoso- 
phers are more addicted than that of taking valuable 
words to express ideas which are sufficiently expressed 
by other words already appropriated to them. 

When it is impossible to obtain good tools, the 
next best thing is to imderstand thoroughly the defects 
of those we have. I have therefore warned the reader 
of the ambiguity of the very names which, for want of 
better, I am necessitated to employ. It must now be 
the writer's endeavour so to employ them as in no 
case to leave his meaning doubtful or obscure. No 
one of the above terms being altogether ambiguous, I 
shall not confine myself to any one, but shall employ 
on each occasion the word which seems least likely in 
the particular case to lead to a misunderstanding of 
my meaning ; nor do I pretend to use either these or 
any other words with a rigorous adherence to one 
single sense. To do so would often leave us without 
a word to express what is signified by a known word 
in some one or other of its senses: unless authors had 
an unlimited license to coin new words, together with 
(what it would be more difficult to assume) unlimited 
power of making their readers adopt them. Nor 
would it be wise in a writer, on a subject involving so 
much of abstraction, to deny himself the advantage 
derived from even an improper use of a term, when.

by means of it, some familiar association is called np 
which brings the meaning home to the mind, as it 
were by a flash. 

The diflSculty both to the writer and reader, of the 
attempt which must be made to use vague words so as 
to convey a precise meaning, is not wholly a matter of 
regret. It is not unfitting that logical treatises should 
afford an example of that, to facilitate which is among 
the most important uses of logic. Philosophical Ian- 
guage will for a long time, and popular language perhaps 
always, retain so much of vagueness and ambiguity, 
that logic would be of little value if it did not, among 
its other advantages, exercise the understanding in 
doing its work neatly and correctly with these imper- 
fect tools. 

After this preamble it is time to proceed to our 
enumeration. We shall commence with FeeUngs, the 
simplest class of nameahle thmgs ; the term Feeling 
being of course understood in its most enlarged sense. 

I. Feelings, or States of Consciousness. 

$ 3. A Feeling and a State of Consciousness are, 
in the language of philosophy, equivalent expressions : 
everything is a Feeling, of which the mind is con- 
scions : everything which it feels ^ or, in other words, 
which forms a part of its own sentient existence. In 
popular language Feeling is not always synonymous 
with State of Consciousness ; being often taken more 
peculiarly for those states which are conceived as 
belonging to the sensitive, or to the emotional, phasis 
of our nature, and sometimes, with a still narrower 
restriction, to the emotional alone: as distinguished 
from what are conceived as belonging to the per- 
cipient, or intellectual phasis. But this is an ad- 
mitted departure from correctness of language ; just 
vox. I. F

66 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

as, by a popular perversion the exact converse of this, 
the word Mind is withdrawn from its rightful gene- 
rality of signification, and restricted to the intellect. 
The still greater perversion by which Feeling is some- 
times confined not only to bodily sensations, but to 
the sensations of a single sense, that of touch, needs 
not be more particularly adverted to. 

Feeling, in the proper sense of the term, is a 
genus, of which Sensation, Emotion, and Thought, are 
subordinate species. Under the word Thought is here 
to be included whatever we are internally conscious of 
when we are said to think ; from the consciousness 
we have when we think of a red colour without hav- 
ing it before our eyes, to the most recondite thoughts 
of a philosopher or poet. Be it remembered, how- 
ever, that by a thought is to be understood what 
passes in the mind itself, and not any object external 
to the mind, which the person is commonly said to be 
thinking of. He may be thinking of the sun, or of 
God, but the sun and God are not thoughts; his 
mental image, however, of the sun, and his idea of 
God, are thoughts ; states of his mind, not of the 
objects themselves: and so also is his beUef of the 
existence of the sun, or of God ; or his disbelief, if the 
case be so. Even imaginary objects, (which are said 
to exist only in our ideas,) are to be distinguished 
from our ideas of them. I may think of a hobgoblin, 
as I may think of the loaf which was eaten yesterday, 
or of the flower which will bloom to-morrow. But 
the hobgoblin which never existed is not the same 
thing with my idea of a hobgoblin, any more than the 
loaf which once existed is the same thing with my 
idea of a loaf, or the flower which does not yet exist, 
but which will exist, is the same with my idea of a 
flower. They are all, not thoughts, but objects of

THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 67 

thought ; though at the present time all the objects 
are alike non-existent. 

In like manner, a Sensation is to be carefully dis- 
tinguished from the object which causes the sensation ; 
our sensation of white from a white object ; nor is it 
less to be distinguished from the attribute whiteness, 
which we ascribe to the object in consequence of its 
exciting the sensation. Unfortunately for clearness 
and due discrimination in considering these subjects^ 
our sensations seldom receive separate names* We 
have a name for the objects which produce in us a 
certain sensation ; the word white. We have a name 
for the quality in those objects^ to which we ascribe 
the sensation; the name whiteness. But when we 
speak of the sensation itself, (as we have not occasion 
to do this often except in our philosophical specula- 
tions,) language, which adapts itself for the most part 
only to the common uses of life> has provided us with 
no single-worded or immediate designation; we must 
employ a circumlocution, and say, The sensation of 
white, or The sensation of whiteness ; we must denomi- 
nate the sensation either from the object, or from the 
attribute, by which it is excited. Yet the sensation, 
though it never does^ might very well be conceived to 
exist, without anything whatever to excite it. We can 
conceive it as arising spontaneously in the mind. But 
if it so arose, we should have no name to denote it which 
would not be a misnomer. In the case of our sensations 
of hearing we are better provided; we have the word 
Sound, and a whole vocabulary of words to denote the 
various kinds of soimds. For as we are often con- 
scious of these sensations in the absence of any per- 
ceptihle object, we can more easily conceive having them 
in the absence of any object whatever. We need only 
dhut our eyes and listen to music, to have a conception 

F 2

68 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

of a universe with nothing in it except sounds, and our- 
selves hearing them : and what is easily conceived 
separately, easily obtains a separate name. But in 
general our names of sensations denote indiscrimi- 
nately the sensation and the attribute. Thus, colour 
stands for the sensations of white, red, &c., but also 
for the quaUty in the coloured object. We talk of 
the colours of things as among their properties. 

{ 4. In the case of sensations, another distinction 
has also to be kept in view, which is often confounded, 
and never without mischievous consequences. This 
is, the distinction between the sensation itself, and the 
state of the bodily organs which precedes the sensa- 
tion, and which constitutes the physical agency by 
which it is produced. One of the sources of confu- 
sion on this subject is the division commonly made of 
feelings into Bodily and Mental. Philosophically 
speaking, there is no foundation at all for this distinc- 
tion: even sensations are states of the sentient mind, 
not states of the body, as distinguished from it. What 
I am conscious of when I see the colour blue, is a 
feeling of blue colour, which is one thing ; the picture 
on my retina, or the phenomenon of hitherto myste- 
rious nature which takes place in my optic nerve or 
in my brain, is another thing, of which I am not at 
all conscious, and which scientific investigation alone 
could have apprised me of. These are states of my 
body ; but the sensation of blue, which is the conse- 
quence of these states of body, is not a state of body : 
that which perceives and is conscious is called Mind. 
When sensations are called bodily feelings, it is only 
as being the class of feeUngs which are immediately 
occasioned by bodily states ; whereas the other kinds 
of feelings, thoughts, for instance, or emotions, are

immediately excited not by anything acting upon the 
bodily organs, but by sensations, or by previous 
thoughts. This, however, is a distinction not in 
our feelings, but in the agency which produces our 
feelings; all of them when actuaUy produced are 
states of mind. 

Besides the affection of our bodily organs from 
without, and the sensation thereby produced in our 
minds, many writers admit a third link in the chain of 
phenomena, which they term a Perception, and which 
consists in the recognition of an external object as the 
exciting cause of the sensation. This perception, 
Ihey say, is an act of the mind, proceeding from its 
own spontaneous activity, while in sensation the mind 
is passive, being merely acted upon by the outward 
object. And according to some philosophers it is by 
an act of the mind, similar to perception, except in 
not being preceded by any sensation, that we recog- 
nise the existence of God, of the soul, and other 
hyperphysical realities. 

These acts of perception, whatever be the conclu- 
sion ultimately come to respecting their nature, must, 
I conceive, take their place among the varieties of 
feelings or states of mind. In so classing them, I 
have not the smallest intention of declaring or insinu- 
ating any theory as to the law of mind in which these 
mental processes may be supposed to originate, or 
the conditions under which they may be legitimate or 
the reverse. Far less do I mean (as Mr. Whewell 
seems to suppose must be meant in an analogous 
case*) to indicate that as they are '^merely states of 
mind,*' it is superfluous to inquire into their distin- 
guishing pecuUarities. I abstain from the inquiry as

irrelevant to the science of logic. In these so-called 
perceptions, or direct recognitions by the mind of 
objects, whether physical or spiritual, which are 
external to itself, I can see only cases of belief; but 
of belief which claims to be intuitive, or independent 
of external evidence. When a stone lies before me, I 
am conscious of certain sensations which I receive 
from it ; but when I say that these sensations come 
to me from an external object which I perceive, the 
meaning of these words is, that receiving the sensa- 
tions, I intuitively believe that an external cause of 
those sensations exists. The laws of intuitive belief, 
and the conditions under which it is legitimate, are 
a subject which, as we have already so often remarked, 
belongs not to logic, but to the higher or transcendental 
branch of metaphysics. 

To the same region of speculation belongs all 
that can be said respecting the distinction which 
the German metaphysicians and their French and 
English followers, (among whom Mr. Whewell is one 
of the most distinguished,) so elaborately draw between 
the acts of the mind and its merely passive states ; 
between what it receives from, and what it gives to, 
the crude materials of its experience. I am aware 
that with reference to the view which those writers 
take of the primary elements of thought and know- 
ledge, this distinction is fundamental. But for our 
purpose, which is to examine, not the original ground- 
work of our knowledge, but how we come by that por- 
tion of it which is not original ; the difference between 
active and passive states of mind is of secondary 
importance. For us, they all are states of mind^ they 
all are feelings ; by which, let it be said once more, I 
mean to imply nothing of passivity, but simply that 
they are psychological facts, facts which take place in

the mind, and to be carefully distinguished from the 
external or physical facts with which they may be 
connected, either as effects or as causes. 

§ 5. Among active states of mind, there is however 
one species which merits particular attention, because 
it forms a principal part of the connotation of some 
important classes of names. I mean volitions^ or acts 
of the will. When we speak of sentient beings by 
relative names, a large portion of the connotation of 
the name usually consists of the actions of those 
beings ; actions past, present, and possible or probable 
future. Take, for instance, the words Sovereign and 
Subject. What meaning do these words convey, but 
that of innumerable- actions, done or to be done by 
the sovereign and the subjects, to or in regard to one 
another reciprocally? So with the words physician 
and patient, leader and follower, master and servant. 
In many cases the words also connote actions which 
would be done under certain contingencies by persons 
other than those denoted: as the words mortgagor 
and mortgagee, obligor and obligee, and many other 
words expressive of legal relation, which connote what 
a court of justice would do to enforce the legal obli- 
gation if not fulfilled. There are also words which 
connote actions previously done by persons other than 
those denoted either by the name itself or by its 
correlative; as the word brother. From these in- 
stances, it may be seen how large a portion of the 
connotation of names consists of actions. Now what 
is an action? Not one thing, but a series of two 
things : the state of mind called a volition, followed 
by an effect. The volition, or intention to produce 
the effect, is one thing ; the effect produced in con- 
sequence of the intention, is another thing ; the two

together constitute the action. I form the purpose of 
instantly moving my arm ; that is a state of my 
mind ; my arm (not being tied nor paralytic) moves 
in obedience to my purpose ; that is a physical fact, 
consequent upon a state of mind. The intention, 
when followed by the fact, or, (if we prefer the ex- 
pression,) the fact when preceded and caused by the 
intention, is called the action of moving my arm. 

§ 6. Of the first leading division of nameable 
things, viz.. Feelings or States of Consciousness, we 
began by recognising three sub-divisions ; Sensations, 
Thoughts, and Emotions. The first two of these we 
have illustrated at considerable length; the third, 
Emotions, not being perplexed by similar ambiguities, 
does not require similar exemplification. And, finally, 
we have found it necessary to add to these three a 
fourth species, commonly known by the name Voli- 
tions. Without seeking to prejudge the metaphysical 
question whether any mental state or phenomenon 
can be found which is not included in one or other of 
these four species, it appears to me that the amount 
of illustration bestowed upon these may, so far as we 
are concerned, suflSce for the whole genus. We shall, 
therefore, proceed to the two remaining classes of 
nameable things; all things which are external to 
the mind being considered as belonging either to the 
class of Substances or to that of Attributes. 

II. Substances. 

Logicians have endeavoured to define Substance 
and Attribute ; but their definitions are not so much 
attempts to draw a distinction between the things 
themselves, as instructions what difierence it is custo- 
mary to make in the grammatical structure of the

THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 73 

sentence, according as you are speaking of substances 
or of attributes. Such definitions are rather lessons 
of English, or of Greek, Latin, or German, than of 
mental philosophy. An attribute, say the school 
logicians, must be the attribute 0/ something: colour, 
for example, must be the colour of something ; good- 
ness must be the goodness of something : and if this 
something should cease to exist, or should cease to be 
connected with the attribute, the existence of the 
attribute would be at an end. A substance, on the 
contrary, is self-existent; in speaking about it, we 
need not put of after its name. A stone is not the 
stone 0/ anything; the moon is not the moon 0/ any- 
thing, but simply the moon. Unless, indeed, the 
name which we choose to give to the substance be a 
relative name ; if so, it must be followed either by 0/, 
or by some other particle, implying, as that preposi- 
tion does, a reference to something else : but then the 
other characteristic peculiarity of an attribute would 
fail ; the something might be destroyed, and the 
substance might still subsist. Thus, a father must be 
the father of something, and so far resembles an 
attribute, in being referred to something besides 
himself: if there were no child, there would be no 
father : but this, when we look into the matter, only 
means that we should not call him father. The man 
called father might still exist, though the child were 
annihilated ; and there would be no contradiction in 
supposing him to exist, although the whole universe 
except himself were destroyed. But destroy all white 
substances, and where would be the attribute white- 
ness? Whiteness, without any white thing, is a 
contradiction in terms. 

This is the nearest approach to a solution of the 
difficulty, that will be found in the common treatises

74 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

on logic. It will scarcely be thought to be a satis- 
factory one. If an attribute is distinguished from a 
substance by being the attribute of something, it 
seems highly necessary to understand what is meant 
by of: a particle which needs explanation too much 
itself to be placed in front of the explanation of 
anything else. And as for the self-existence of sub- 
stances, it is very true that a substance may be con- 
ceived to exist without any other substance, but so 
also may an attribute without any other attribute: 
and we can no more imagine a substance without 
attributes than we can imagine attributes without a 
substance. 

Metaphysicians, however, have probed the ques- 
tion deeper, and giveA an account of Substance 
considerably more satisfactory than this. Substances 
are usually distinguished as Bodies or Minds. Of 
each of these, philosophers have at length provided 
us with a definition which seems unexceptionable. 

$ 7. A Body, according to the received doctrine of 
modem metaphysicians, may be defined, the external 
cause to which we ascribe our sensations. When I see 
and touch apiece of gold, I am conscious of a sensation 
of yellow colour, and sensations of hardness and weight ; 
and by varying the mode of handling, I may add to 
these sensations many others completely distinct from 
them. The sensations are all of which I am directly 
conscious ; but I consider them as produced by some- 
thing not only existing independently of my will, but 
external to my bodily organs and to my mind* This 
external something I call a Body. 

It may be asked, how come we to ascribe our 
sensations to any external cause ? and is there sufiS- 
cient ground for so ascribing them? It is known, that

THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 75 

there are metaphysicians who have raised a contro- 
versy on the point ; maintaming the paradox, that we 
are not warranted in referring our sensations to a 
cause, such as we understand by the word Body, or to 
any cause whatever, unless, indeed, the First Cause. 
Though we have no concern here with this contro- 
versy, nor with the metaphysical niceties on which it 
tums^ one of the best ways of showing what is meant 
by Substance is, to consider what position it is neces- 
sary to take up, in order to maintain its existence 
against opponents. 

It is certain, then, that a part of our notion of a 
body consists of the notion of a number of sensations 
of our own, or of other sentient beings, habitually 
occurring simultaneously. My conception of the table 
at which I am writing is compounded of its visible 
form and size, which are complex sensations of sight ; 
its tangible form and size, which are complex sensa- 
tions of our organ of touch and of our muscles ; its 
weight, which is also a sensation of touch and of the 
muscles ; its colour, which is a sensation of sight; its 
hardness, which is a sensation of the muscles; its 
composition, which is another word for all the va* 
rieties of sensation which we receive under various 
circumstances from the wood of which it is made ; and 
so forth. All or most of these various sensations 
frequently are, and, as we learn by experience, always 
might be, experienced simultaneously, or in many 
different orders of succession, at our own choice : and, 
hence the thought of any one of them makes us think 
of the others, and the whole become mentally amal- 
gated into one mixed state of consciousness, which, 
in the language of the school of Locke and Hartley, is 
termed a Complex Idea. 

Now there are philosophers who have argued as

follows : — ^if we take an orange, and conceive it to be 
divested of its natural colour without acquiring any 
new one ; to lose its softness without becoming hard, 
its roundness without becoming square or pentagonal, 
or of any other regular or irregular figure whatever; 
to be deprived of size, of weight, of taste, of smell ; 
to lose all its mechanical and all its chemical pro- 
perties, and acquire no new ones ; to become, in short, 
invisible, intangible, and imperceptible not only by all 
our senses, but by the senses of all other sentient 
beings, real or possible; nothing, say these philo- 
sophers, would remain. For of what nature, they 
ask, could be the residuum ? and by what token could 
it manifest its presence? To the unreflecting its 
existence seems to rest on the evidence of the senses. 
But to the senses nothing is apparent except the 
sensations. We know, indeed, that these sensations 
are bound together by some law; they do not come 
together at random, but according to a systematic 
order, which is part of the order established in the 
universe. When we experience one of these sensations, 
we usually experience the others also, or know 
that we have it in our power to experience them. 
But a fixed law of connexion, making the sensations 
occur together, does not, say these philosophers, 
necessarily require what is called a substratum to 
support them. The conception of a substratum is 
but one of many possible forms in which that con- 
nexion presents itself to our imagination ; a mode of, 
as it were, realizing the idea. If there be such a 
substratum, suppose it this instant annihilated by the 
fiat of Omnipotence, and let the sensations continue 
to occur in the same order, and how would the 
substratum be missed ? By what signs should we be 
able to discover that its existence had terminated?

should we not have as much reason to believe that 
it still existed, as we now have ? and if we should not 
then be warranted in believing it, how can we be so 
now? A body, therefore, according to these meta- 
physicians, is not anything intrinsically different from 
the sensations which the body is said to produce in 
US; it is, in short, a set of sensations joined together 
according to a fixed law. 

These ingenious speculations have at no time in 
the history of philosophy made many proselytes ; but 
the controversies to which they have given rise, and 
the doctrines which have been developed in the 
attempt to find a conclusive answer to them, have 
been fruitful of important consequences to the Science 
of Mind- The sensations (it was answered) which we 
are conscious of, and which we receive not at random, 
but joined together in a certain uniform manner, 
imply not only a law or laws of connexion, but a 
cause external to our mind, which cause, by its own 
laws, determines the laws according to which the 
sensations are connected and experienced. The 
schoolmen used to call this external cause by the 
name we have already employed, a substratum; and 
its attributes (as they expressed themselves) inhered, 
literally stucky in it. To this substratum the name 
Matter is usually given in philosophical discussions. 
It was soon, however, acknowledged by all who 
reflected on the subject, that the existence of matter 
could not be proved by extrinsic evidence. The 
answer, therefore, now usually made to Berkeley and 
his followers, is, that the belief is intuitive; that 
mankind, in all ages, have felt themselves compelled, 
by a necessity of their nature, to refer their sensations 
to an external cause : that even those who deny it in 
theory, yield to the necessity in practice, and both in

speech^ thought, and feeling, do, equally with the 
vulgar, acknowledge their sensations to be the effects 
of something external to them : this knowledge, 
therefore, is as evidently intuitive as oiu* knowledge 
of our sensations themselves is intuitive. And here 
the question merges in the fundamental problem of 
transcendental metaphysics; to which science we 
leave it. 

But although the extreme doctrine of the Idealist 
metaphysicians, that objects are nothing but our 
sensations and the laws which connect them, has 
appeared to few subsequent thinkers to be worthy of 
assent ; the only point of much real importance is one 
upon which those metaphysicians are now very gene- 
rally considered to have made out their case: viz., 
that all we know of objects is the sensations which 
they give us, and the order of the occurrence of those 
sensations. Kant himself, on this point, is as explicit 
as Berkeley or Locke. However firmly convinced 
that there exists an universe of " Things in them- 
selves," totally distinct from the universe of pheno- 
mena, or of things as they appear to our senses ; and 
even when bringing into use the technical expression 
{Noumenon) to denote what the thing is in itself, as 
contrasted with the representation of it in our minds ; 
he allows that this representation (the matter of which, 
he says, consists of our sensations, though the form 
is given by the laws of the mind itself) is all we know 
of the object ; and that the real nature of the Thing 
is, and by the constitution of our faculties ever must 
remain, at least in this sublunary existence, an 
impenetrable mystery to us*. There is not the

slightest reason for believing that what we call the 
sensible qualities of the object are a type of anything 
inherent in itself, or bear any affinity to its own 
nature. A cause does not, as such, resemble its 
effects ; an east wind is not Uke the feeling of cold,

* An attempt, indeed, has been made by Reid and others, 
to establish that although some of the properties we ascribe to 
objects exist only in our sensations, others exist in the things them- 
selves, being such as cannot possibly be copies of any impression 
upon the senses; and they ask, from what sensation our notions of 
extension and figure have been derived? The gauntlet thrown 
down by Reid was taken up by Brown, who, applying greater 
powers of analysis than had previously been applied to the notions 
of extension and figure, showed clearly what are the sensations from 
which those notions are derived, viz., sensations of touch, com- 
bined with sensations of a class previously too little adverted to by 
metaphysicians, those which have their seat in our muscular frame. 
Whoever wishes to be more particularly acquainted with this 
admirable specimen of metaphysical analysis, may consult the first 
volume of Brown's Lectures^ or Mill's Analytie of the Mtnd. 

On this subject also, the authority of M. Cousin may be quoted 
in favour of conclusions rejected by some of the most eminent 
thinkers of the school to which he belongs. M. Cousin recognises, 
in opposition to Reid, the essential subjectivity of our conceptions of 
the primary qualities of matter, as extension, solidity, &c., equally 
with those of colour, heat, and the remainder of what are called 
secondary qualities,— Cbwr*, tU eupra^ 9me le9on.

know and can know absolutely nothing, except the 
sensations which we experience from it. Those, how- 
ever, who still look upon Ontology as a possible 
science, and think, not only that bodies have an 
essential constitution of their own, lying deeper than 
our perceptions, but that this essence or nature is not 
altogether inaccessible to human investigation, cannot 
expect to find their refutation here. The question 
depends upon the nature and laws of Intuitive Know- 
ledge^ and is not within the province of logic. 

§ 8. Body having now been defined the external 
cause, and (according to the more reasonable opinion) 
the hidden external cause, to which we refer our sen- 
sations ; it remains to frame a definition of Mind. 
Nor, after the preceding observations, will this be 
difficult. For, as our conception of a body is that of 
an unknown exciting cause of sensations, so our con- 
ception of a mind is that of an unknown recipient, or 
percipient, of them ; and not of them alone, but of all 
our other feelings. As body is the mysterious some- 
thing which excites the mind to feel, so mind is the 
mysterious something which feels, and thinks. It is 
unnecessary to give in the case of mind, as we gave 
in the case of matter, a particular statement of the 
sceptical system by which its existence as a Thing in 
itself, distinct from the series of what are denominated 
its states, is called in question. But it is necessary 
to remark, that on the inmost nature of the thinking 
principle, as well as on the inmost nature of matter, 
we are, and with our human faculties must always 
remain, entirely in the dark. All which we 
are aware of, even in our own minds, is (in the 
words of Mr. Mill) a certain " thread of conscious- 
ness;" a series of feelings, that is, of sensations.

thoughts, emotioDs, and volitions, more or less nume- 
rous and complicated. There is a something I call 
Myself, or, by another form of expression, my mind, 
which I consider as distinct from these sensations, 
thoughts, &c. ; a something which I conceive to be 
not the thoughts, but the being that has the thoughts^ 
and which I can conceive as existing for ever in a 
state of quiescence, without any thoughts at all. But 
what this being is, although it is myself, I have no 
knowledge, further than the series of its states of 
consciousness. As bodies manifest themselves to me 
only through the sensations of which I regard them 
as the causes, so the thinking principle, or mind, in 
my own nature, makes itself known to me only by 
the feelings of which it is conscious. I know nothing 
about myself, save my capacities of feeling or being 
conscious (including, of course, thinking and willing) : 
and were I to learn anything new concerning myself, 1 
cannot with my present faculties conceive this new 
information to be anything else, than that I have 
some additional capacities, before unknown to me, of 
feeling, thinking, or willing. 

Thus, then, as body is the unsentient cause to 
which we are naturally prompted to refer a certain 
portion of our feelings, so mind may be described as 
the sentient subject (in the German sense of the term) 
of all feelings ; that which has or feels them. But of 
the nature of either body or mind, further than the 
feelings which the former excites, and which the 
latter experiences, we do not, according to the best 
existing doctrine, know anything; and if anything, 
logic has nothing to do with it, or with the manner 
in which the knowledge is acquired. With this result 
we may conclude this portion of our subject, and pass 
to the third and only remaining class or division of 
Nameable Things.

ni. — ^Attributes: and, first, Qualities. 

§ 9. From what has abeady been said of Sub- 
stance, what is to be said of Attribute is easily 
deducible. For if we know not, and cannot know, 
anything of bodies but the sensations which they 
excite in us or others, those sensations must be all 
that we can, at bottom, mean by their attributes; 
and the distinction which we verbally make between 
the properties of things and the sensations we receive 
from them, must originate in the convenience of dis- 
course rather than in the nature of what is denoted 
by the terras. 

Attributes are usually distributed under the three 
heads of Quality, Quantity, and Relation. We shall 
come to the two latter presently : in the first place 
we shall confine ourselves to the former. 

Let us take, then, as our example, one of what 
are termed the sensible qualities of objects, and let 
that example be whiteness. When we ascribe white- 
ness to any substance, as, for instance, snow ; when 
we say that snow has the quality whiteness, what do 
we really assert ? Simply, that when snow is present 
to our organs, we have a particular sensation, which 
we are accustomed to call the sensation of white. 
But how do I know that snow is present ? Obviously 
by the sensations which I derive from it, and not 
otherwise. I infer that the object is present, because 
it gives me a certain assemblage or series of sensa- 
tions. And when I ascribe to it the attribute white- 
ness, my meaning is only, that, of the sensations 
composing this group or series, that which I call the 
sensation of white colour is one. 

This is one view which may be taken of the 
subject. But there is also another, and a difierent

view. It may be said, that it is tnie we know nothing 
of sensible objects, except the sensations they excite 
in us ; that the fact of ovir receiving from snow the 
particular sensation which is called a sensation of 
white, is the ground on which we ascribe to that sub- 
stance the quality whiteness ; the sole proof of its 
possessing that quality. But because one thing may 
be the sole evidence of the existence of another thing, 
it does not follow that the two are one and the same. 
The attribute whiteness (it may be said) is not the 
fact of our receiving the sensation, but something in 
the object itself; a power inherent in it ; something in 
virtue of which the object produces the sensation. 
And when we affirm that snow possesses the attribute 
whiteness, we do not merely assert that the presence 
of snow produces in us that sensation, but that it 
does so through, and by reason of, that power or 
quality. 

For the purposes of logic it is not of material 
importance which of these views we adopt. The full 
discussion of the subject belongs to the department of 
inquiry so often alluded to under the name of the 
higher metaphysics ; but it may be said here, that for 
the doctrine of the existence of a peculiar species of 
entities called qualities, I can see no foundation except 
in a tendency of the human mind which is the cause 
of many delusions. I mean, the disposition, wherever 
we meet with two names which are not precisely syno- 
nymous, to suppose that they must be the names of 
two diflFerent things ; whereas in reality they may be 
names of the same thing viewed in two different 
lights, which is as much as to say under different 
suppositions as to surrounding circumstances. Be- 
cause quality and sensation cannot be put indiscrimi- 
nately one for the other, it is supposed that they

THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 85 

cannot both signify the same thing, namely, the 
impression or feeling with which we are affected 
through our senses by the presence of an object: 
although there is at least no absurdity in supposing 
that this identical impression or feeling may be called 
a sensation when considered merely in itself, and a 
quality when regarded as emanating from any one 
of the numerous objects, the presence of which to ovir 
organs excites in our minds that among various other 
sensavions or feelings. And if this be admissible as a 
supposition, it rests with those who contend for an 
entity pet se called a quality, to show that their 
opinion is preferable, or is anything in fact but a 
lingering remnant of the scholastic doctrine of occult 
causes ; the very absurdity which Moliere so happily 
ridiculed when he made one of his pedantic physicians 
account for the fact that *^ Topium endormit, " by the 
maxim ** parcequ'il a une verlu soporifique." 

It v^ evident that when the physician stated that 
opium had **une vertu soporifique," he did not 
account for, but merely asserted over again, the fact 
that it endormit. In like manner, when we say that 
snow is white because it has the quality of whiteness, 
we are only re-asserting in more technical language 
the fact that it excites in us the sensation of white. 
If it be said that the sensation must have some cause, 
I answer, its cause is the presence of the object. 
When wc have asserted that as often as the object is 
present, and our organs in their normal state, the 
sensation takes place, we have stated all that we know 
about the matter. There is no need, after assigning 
a certain and intelligible cause, to suppose an occult 
cause besides, for the purpose of enabling the real 
cause to produce its effect. If I am asked, why does

86 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

the presence of the object cause this seDsation in me, 
I cannot tell : I can only say that such is my nature, 
and the nature of the object: the constitution of 
things, the scheme of the universe, will have it so. 
And to this we must at last come, even after interpo* 
lating the imaginary entity. Whatever number of 
links the chain of causes and effects may consist ^of, 
how any one link produces the one which is next to 
it remains equally inexplicable to us. It is as easy to 
comprehend that the object should produce the, sensa- 
tion directly and at once, as that it should produce 
the same sensation by the aid of something else called 
the power of producing it. 

But as the difficulties which may be felt in adopt- 
ing this view of the subject cannot be removed with- 
out discussions transcending the bounds of our 
science, I content myself with a passing indication, 
and shall, for the purposes of logic^ adopt a language 
compatible with either view of the nature of qudities. 
I shall say, — ^what at least admits of no dispute, — that 
the quality of whiteness ascribed to the object snow, 
is grounded upon its exciting in us the sensation of 
white ; and, adopting the language already used by 
the school logicians in the case of the kind of attri^ 
butes called Relations, I shall term the sensation of 
white the foundation of the quality whiteness. For 
logical purposes the sensation is the only essential 
part of what is meant by the word ; the only part 
which we ever can be concerned in proving. When 
that is proved the quality is proved; if an object 
excites a sensation, it has, of course, the power of 
exciting it.

IV. Relations. 

4 10. The qualities of a body, we have said, are 
the attributes grounded upon the sensations which the 
presence of that particular body to our organs excites 
in our minds. But when we ascribe to any object the 
kind of attribute called a Relation, the foundation of 
the attribute must be something in which other objects 
are concerned besides itself and the percipient. 

As there may with propriety be said to be a rela- 
tion between any two things to which two correlative 
names are or may be given; we may expect to dis- 
cover what constitutes a relation .in general, if we 
enumerate the principal cases in which mankind have 
imposed correlative names, and observe what all these 
cases have iii common. 

What, then, is the character which is possessed in 
common by states of circumstances so heterogeneous 
and discordant as these : one thing tike another ; one 
thing unlike another ; one thing near another ; one 
thing /ar from another; one thing before^ after y along 
with another ; one thing greater^ equal, less, than ano- 
ther ; one thing the cause of another, the effect of 
another ; one person the master ^ servant y childy parent^ 
husbandy unfe^ sovereign, subject, attorney y clienty of 
another, and so on ? 

Omitting, for the present, the case of Resemblance, 
(a relation which requires to be considered separately,) 
there seems to be one thing common to all these cases, 
and only one ; that in each of them there exists or 
occurs, or has existed or occurred, some /act or phe- 
nomenon, into which the two things which are said to 
be related to each other, both enter as parties con- 
cerned. This fact, or phenomenon, is what the Aris- 
totelian logicians called the fundamentum relationis. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



88 NAMES AND PROPOSITION*. 

Thus in the relation of greater and less between two 
magnitudes, the fundamentum relationis is the fact that 
when one of the two magnitudes is applied to the 
other, it more than covers it ; and cannot, by any new 
arrangement of parts, be entirely brought within the 
boundaries of the other object. In the relation of 
master and servant, the fundamentum relationis is the 
fact that the one has undertaken^ or is compelled^ to 
perform certain services for the benefit, and at the 
bidding, of the other. In that of husband and wife, 
the fundamentum relationis consists of the facts 
that the parties are a man and a woman, that they 
have promised certain things with certain formali- 
ties, and are in consequence invested by the law 
with certain rights, and subjected to certain duties* 
Examples might be indefinitely multiplied, but it is 
already obvious that whenever two things are said to 
be related, there is some fact, or series of facts, into 
which they both enter ; and that whenever any two 
things are involved in some one fact, or series of 
facts, we may ascribe to those two things a mutual 
relation grounded on the fact. Even if they have 
nothing in common but what is common to all things, 
that they are members of the universe, we call that a 
relation, and denominate them fellow-creatures, fellow- 
beings, or fellow-denizens of the universe. But in 
proportion as the fact into which the two objects enter 
as parts is of a more special and peculiar, cur of a more 
complicated nature, so also is the relation grounded 
upon it. And there are as many conceivable relations 
as there are conceivable kinds of fact in which two 
things can be jointly concerned. 

In the same manner, therefore, as a quality is an 
attribute grounded upon the fact that a certain sensa- 
tion or sensations are produced in us by the object. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 89 

SO an attribute grouDded upon some fact into which 
the object enters jointly with another object, is a rela- 
tion between it and that other object. But the fact in 
the latter case consists of the very same kind of ele- 
ments as the fact in the former : namely, states of 
consciousness. In the case last cited, for example, 
the relation of husband and wife ; the fundamentum 
reUUionis consists entirely of thoughts, emotions, sen^- 
sations, and volitions (actual or contingent), either of 
the parties themselves or of other parties concerned 
in the same series of transactions, as, for instance, 
the intentions which would be formed by a judge in 
case a complaint were made to his tribunal of the in- 
fringement of any of the legal obligations imposed by 
marriage ; and the acts which the judge would per- 
form in consequence ; acts being (as we have already 
seen) another word for intentions followed by an 
effect, and that effect (again) being but another word 
for sensations, or some other feelings, occasioned 
either to oneself or to somebody else. There is no 
part whatever of what the names expressive of the 
relation imply, that is not resolvable into states of con- 
sciousness ; outward objects being, no doubt, supposed 
throughout as the causes by which some of those 
states of consciousness are excited, and minds as the 
subjects by which all of them are experienced, but 
neither the external objects nor the minds making 
their existence known otherwise than by the states of 
consciousness. 

Cases of relation are not always so complicated as 
that to which 'we last alluded. The simplest of all 
cases of relation are those expressed by the words 
antecedent and consequent, and by the word simul- 
taneous. If we say, for instance, that dawn preceded 
sunrise, the fact in which the two things, dawn and 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



90 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

sunrise, were jointly concerned, consisted only of the 
two things themselves: no third thing entered into 
the fact or phenomenon at aU ; unless, indeed, we 
choose to call the succession of the two objects a third 
thing ; but their succession is not something added to 
the things themselves; it is something involved in 
them. Dawn and sunrise announce themselves to our 
consciousness by two successive sensatimis : our con- 
sciousness of the succession of these sensations is not 
a third sensation or feding added to them ; we have 
not first the two feelings, and then a feeling of their 
succession. To have two feelings at all, implies having 
them either successively, or else simultaneously. 
Sensations, or other feelings, being given, succession 
and simultaneousness are the two conditions, to the 
alternative of which they are subjected by the nature 
of our faculties ; and no one has been able, or needs 
expect, to analyze the matter any farther. 

§ 11. In a somewhat similar position are two other 
sorts of relation, Likeness and Unlikeness. I have 
two sensations ; we will suppose them to be simple 
ones; two sensations of white, or one sensation of 
white and another of black. I call the first two 
sensations like; the last two unlike. What is the fact 
or phenomenon constituting the fundamentum of this 
relation ? The two s ensations first, and then what we 
call a feeling of resemblance, or a feeling of want of 
resemblance. Let us confine ourselves to the former 
ease. Resemblance is evidently a feeling ; a state of 
the consciousness of the observer. Whether the 
feeling of the resemblance of the two colours be a 
third state of consciousness, which I have after having 
the two sensations of colour, or whether (like the 
feeling of their succession) it is involved in the sensa-

THINGS DBNOTBD BY NAMES. 91 

tions themselves, may be a matter of discussion. But 
in either case^ these feelings of resemblance, and of 
its opposite, dissimilarity, are parts of our nature ; 
and parts so far from being capable of analysis, that 
they are pre-supposed in every attempt to analyse any 
of our other feelings. Likeness and unlikeness, there- 
fore, as well as antecedence, sequence, and simulta- 
neousness, must stand apart among relations, as things 
sui generis. They are attributes grounded on facts, 
that is, on states of consciousness, but on states 
which are peculiar, unresolvable, and inexplicable. 

But, although likeness or unlikeness cannot be 
resolved into anything else, complex cases of likeness 
or unlikeness can be resolved into simpler ones. 
When we say of two things which consist of parts, 
that they are like one another, the likeness of the 
whole does admit of analysis ; it is compounded of 
likenesses between the various parts respectively. Of 
how vast a variety of resemblances of parts must that 
resemblance be composed, which induces us to say that 
a portrait, or a landscape, is like its original. If one 
person mimics another with any success, of bow many 
simple likenesses must the general or complex like- 
ness be compounded : likeness in a succession of 
bodily postures ; likeness in voice, or in the accents 
and intonations of the voice ; likeness in the choice 
of words, and in the thoughts or sentiments ex- 
pressed, whether by word, countenance, or gesture. 

All likeness and unlikeness of which we have any 
cognizance, resolve themselves into likeness and un- 
likeness between states of our own, or some other, 
mind. When we say that one body is like another, 
(since we know nothing of bodies but the sensations 
which they excite,) we mean really that there is a 
resemblance between the sensations excited by the

92 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

two bodies, or between some portion at least of these 
sensations. If we say that two attributes are like one 
another, (since we know nothing of attributes except 
the sensations or states of feeling on which they are 
grounded,) we mean really that those sensations, or 
states of feeling, resemble each other. We may also say 
that two relations are alike. The fact of resemblance 
between relations is sometimes called analogy y forming 
one of the numerous meanings of that word. The 
relation in which Priam stood to Hector, namely, that 
of father and son, resembles the relation in which 
Philip stood to Alexander; resembles it so closely 
that they are called the same relation. The relation 
in which Cromwell stood to England resembles the 
relation in which Napoleon stood to France, though 
not so closely as to be called the same relation. The 
meaning in both these instances must be, that a 
resemblance existed between the facts which consti- 
tuted iht fundamentum relationis. 

This resemblance may exist in all conceivable 
gradations, from perfect undistinguishableness to 
something very slight indeed. When we say, that a 
thought suggested to the mind of a person of genius 
is like a seed cast into the ground, because the former 
produces a multitude of other thoughts, and the latter 
a multitude of other seeds, this is saying that between 
the relation of an inventive mind to a thought con- 
tained in it, and the relation of a fertile soil to a seed 
contained in it, there exists a resemblance : the real 
resemblance being in the two fundamenta relationis^ in 
each of which there occurs a germ, producing by its 
developement a multitude of other things similar to 
itself. And as, whenever two objects are jointly 
concerned in a phenomenon, this constitutes a rela^ 
tion between those objects; so, if we suppose a second

THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 93 

pair of objects concerned in a second phenomenon, 
the slightest resemblance between the two phenomena 
is sufficient to admit of its being said that the two 
relations resemble; provided, of course, the points of 
resemblance are found in those portions of the two 
phenomena respectively which are connoted by the 
relative names. 

While speaking of resemblance, it is necessary to 
take notice of an ambiguity of language, against which 
scarcely any one is sufficiently on his guard. Resem- 
blance, when it exists in the highest degree of all, 
amounting to undistinguishableness, is often called 
identity, and the two similar things are said to be the 
same. I say often, not always; for we do not say 
that two visible objects, two persons for instance, are 
the same, because they are so much alike that one 
might be mistaken for the other : but we constantly 
use this mode of expression when speaking of feel- 
ings ; as when I say that the sight of any object gives 
me the same sensation or emotion to-day that it did 
yesterday, or the same which it gives to some other 
person. This is evidently an incorrect application 
of the word sam^; for the feeling which I had yester- 
day is gone, never to return ; what I have to-day is 
another feeling, exactly like the former perhaps, but 
distinct from it ; and it is evident that two different 
persons cannot be experiencing the same feeling, in 
the sense in which we say that they are both sitting 
at the same table. By a similar ambiguity we say, 
that two persons are ill of the same disease ; that two 
people hold the same office ; not in the sense in which 
we say that they are engaged in the same adventure, 
or sailing in the same ship, but in the sense that they 
fill offices exactly similar, though, perhaps, in distant 
places. Great confusion of ideas is often produced.

and many fallacies engendered, in otherwise enlight- 
ened understandings, by not being sufficiently alive to 
the fact (in itself not always to be avoided), that they 
use the same name to exi>ress ideas so different as 
those of identity and undistinguishable resemblance. 
Among modern writers. Archbishop Whately stands 
almost alone in having drawn attention to this dis- 
tinction, and to the ambiguity connected with it*. 



* ** Same (as well as ^ One,' *• Identical,' and other words derived 
from them) is used frequently in a sense very different from its 
primary one, as applicable to a ttn^ls object, being employed to 
denote great nmilarity. When several objects are undistinguish- 
ably alike, one nngh description will apply equally to any of them ; 
and thence they are said to be all of one and the eaime nature, appear- 
ance, &c., as e. g.y when we say ^ this house is built of the eame 
stone with such another,' we only mean that the stones are undis- 
tinguishable in their qualities; not that the one building was pulled 
down, and the other constructed with the materials. Whereas 
sameness, in the primary sense, does not even necessarily imply 
similarity; for if we say of any man, that he is greatly altered since 
such a time, we understand, and, indeed, imply by the very expres- 
sion, that he is one person^ though different in several qualities. It 
is worth observing also, that Same, in the secondary sense, admits, 
according to popular usage, of degreee. We speak of two things 
being nearly the same, but not entirely; personal identity does not 
admit of degrees. Nothing, perhaps, has contributed more to the 
error of Realism than inattention to this ambiguity. "N^en several 
persons are said to have One and the Same opinion, thought, or 
idea, men, overlooking the true simple statement of the case, which 
is, that they are all thinking alike^ look for something more abstruse 
and mystical, and imagine there must be some One Thing^ in the 
primary sense, though not an individual, which is present at once 
in the mind of each of these persons; and thence readily sprung 
Plato's Theory of Ideas, each of which was, according to him, one 
real, eternal object, existing entire and complete in each of the 
individual objects that are known by one name. . . . The Hindoos 
of the present day, from observing the similar symptoms which are 
known by the name of small-pox, and the communication of the 
like from one patient to another, do not merely call it (as we do)

Several relations, generally called by other names, 
are really cases of resemblance. As for example, 
equality; which is but another word for the exact 
resemblance commonly called identity, considered 
as subsisting between things in respect of their 
quantity. And this example forms a suitable transit 
tion to the third and last of the three heads, under 
which, as already remarked, Attributes are commonly 
arranged. 

V. Quantity. 

$ 1 2. Let us imagine two things, between which 
there is no difference (that is, no dissimilarity), except 
in quantity alone : for instance, a gallon of water, and 
more than a gallon of water. A gallon of water, Uke 
any other external object, makes its presence known 
to us by a set of sensations which it excites. Ten 
gallons of water are also an external object, making its 
presence known to us in a similar manner ; and as 
we do not mistake ten gallons of water for a gallon of 
water, it is plain that the set of sensations is more 
or less different in the two cases. In like manner, a 
gallon of water, and a gallon of Madeira, are two 
external objects, making their presence known by two 
sets of sensations, which sensations are different from 
each other. In the first case, however, we say that 
the difference is in quantity ; in the last there is a 
difierence in quality, while the quantity of the water 
and of the Madeira is the same. What is the real 



one disease, but believe (if we maj credit the accounts given) that 
die small-pox is a goddess, who becomes incarnate in each infected 
patient.** — Loffie; Appendix on Ambiguous Terms, p. 298. My 
r^erences to this work are always to the first edition.

96 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

distinction between the two cases? It is not the 
province of Logic to analyse it ; nor to decide whether 
it is susceptible of analysis or not. For us the fol- 
lowing considerations are sufficient. It is evident 
that the sensations I receive from the gallon of 
water, and those I receive from the gallon of Madeira, 
are not the same, that is, not precisely alike ; neither 
are they altogether unlike: they are partly similar, 
partly dissimilar ; and that in which they resemble is 
precisely that in which alone the gallon of water and 
the ten gallons do not resemble. That in which the 
gallon of water and the gallon of wine are like each 
other, and in which the gallon and the ten gallons of 
water are unlike each other, is called their quantity. 
This likeness and unlikeness I do not pretend to explain, 
no more than any other kind of likeness or unlike- 
ness. But my object is to show, that when we say of 
two things that they differ in quantity, just as when 
we say that they differ in quality, the assertion is 
always grounded upon a difference in the sensations 
which they excite. Nobody, I presume, will say, 
that to see, or to lift, or to drink, ten gallons of water, 
does not include in itself a different set of sensations 
from those of seeing, lifting, or drinking one gallon ; 
or that to see or handle a foot-rule, and to see or 
handle a yard-measure made exactly like it, are the 
same sensations. I do not undertake to say what the 
difference in the sensations is. Everybody knows, and 
nobody can tell ; no more than any one could tell what 
white is, to a person who had never had the -sensation. 
But the difference, so far as cognizable by our faculties, 
lies in the sensations. Whatever difference we say 
there is in the things themselves, is, in this as in all 
other cases, grounded, and grounded exclusively, on a 
difference in the sensations excited by them.

VI. Attributes Concluded, 

§ 13. Thus, then, all the attributes of bodies 
which are classed imder Quality or Quantity, are 
grounded upon the sensations which we receive from 
those bodies, and may be defined, the powers which 
the bodies have of exciting those sensations. And 
the same general explanation has been found to 
apply to most of the attributes usually classed under 
the head of Relation. They, too, are grounded 
upon some fact or phenomenon into which the related 
objects enter as parts; that fact or phenomenon 
having no meaning and no existence to us, except 
the series of sensations or other states of con- 
sciousness hy which it makes itself known : and the 
relation being simply the power or capacity which the 
object possesses, of taking part along with the cor- 
related object in the production of that series of 
sensations or states of consciousness. We have been 
obliged, indeed, to recognise a somewhat different 
character in certain peculiar relations, those of suc- 
cession and simultaneity, of likeness and unlikeness. 
These, not being grounded on any fact or phenomenon 
distinct from the related objects themselves, do not 
admit of the same kind of analysis. But these 
relations, though not, like other relations, grounded 
upon states of consciousness, are themselves states of 
consciousness : resemblance is nothing but our feeling 
of resemblance ; succession is nothing but our feeling 
of succession. Or, if this be disputed, (and we cannot, 
without transgressing the bounds of our science, 
discuss it here,) at least our knowledge of these 
relations, and even our possibility of knowledge, is 
confined to those which subsist between sensations or 
other states of consciousness : for, though we ascribe

98 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

resemblance, or succession, or simultaneity, to objects 
and to attributes, it is always in virtue of resemblance 
or succession or simultaneity in the sensations or 
states of consciousness which those objects excite, and 
on which those attributes are grounded. 

§ 14. In the preceding investigation we have, for 
the sake of simpUcity, considered bodies only, and 
omitted minds. But what we have said is appUcable, 
mutatis mutandis^ to the latter. The attributes of 
minds, as well as those of bodies, are grounded upon 
states of feeling or consciousness. But in the case of 
a mind, we have to consider its own states, as well as 
those which it produces in other minds. Every attri- 
bute of a mind consists either in being itself affected 
in a certain way, or affecting other minds in a certain 
way. Considered in itself, we can predicate nothing 
of it, but the series of its own feelings. When we say 
of any mind, that it is devout, or superstitious, or 
meditative, or cheerful, we mean that the ideas, 
emotions, or volitions implied in those words, form a 
frequently recurring part of the series of feelings, or 
states of consciousness, which fill up the sentient 
existence of that mind. 

In addition, however, to those attributes of a mind, 
which are grounded upon its own states of feeling, 
attributes may also be ascribed to it, in the same 
manner as to a body, grounded on the feelings which 
it excites in other minds. A mind does not, indeed, 
like a body, excite sensations, but it may excite 
thoughts or emotions. The most important example 
of attributes ascribed on this ground is, the employ- 
ment of terms expressive of approbation or blame. 
When, for example, we say of any character, or (in 
other words) of any mind, that it is admirable, we 



Digitized 



by Google 



THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 99 

mean that the contemplation of it excites the senti- 
ment of admiration ; and indeed somewhat more, 
for the word implies that we not only feel admiration, 
but approve that sentiment in ourselves. In some 
cases, under the semblance of a single attribute, two 
are really predicated: one of them, a state of the 
mind itself; the other, a state with which other 
minds are aflfected by thinking of it : as when we say 
of any one that he is generous. The word generosity 
expresses a certain fitate of mind, but being a term of 
praise, it also expresses that this state of mind excites 
in us another mental state, called approbation. The 
assertion made, therefore, is twofold, and of the fol- 
lowing purport : Certain feelings form habitually a part 
of this person's sentient existence ; and, moreover, 
the idea of those feelings of his, excites the sentiment 
of approbation in ourselves or others. 

As we thus ascribe attributes to minds on the 
ground of ideas and emotions, so may we to bodies 
on similar grounds, and not solely on the ground of 
sensations : as in speaking of the beauty of a statue ; 
since this attribute is grounded upon the peculiar 
feeling of pleasure which the statue produces in our 
minds, and which is not a sensation, but an emotion. 

VII. General Result. 

$ 15. Our survey of the varieties of Things which 
have been, or which are capable of being, named — 
which have been, or are capable of being, either 
predicated of other Things, or made (themselves the 
subject of predications — is now complete. 

Our enumeration commenced with Feelings. These 
we scrupulously distinguished from the objects which 
excite them, and from the organs by which they are, 

 



100 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

or may be supposed to be, conveyed. Feelings are of 
four sorts: Sensations, Thoughts, Emotions, and 
Volitions. What are called perceptions are merely a 
particular case of Belief, and belief is a kind of 
thought. Actions are merely volitions followed by an 
effect. If there be any other kind of mental state not 
included under these subdivisions, we did not think 
it necessary or proper in this place to discuss its 
existence, or the rank which ought to be assigned 
to it. 

After Feelings we proceeded to Substances. 
These are either Bodies or Minds. Without entering 
into the grounds of the metaphysical doubts which 
have been raised concerning the existence of Matter 
and Mind as objective realities, we stated as sufficient 
for us the conclusion in which the best thinkers are 
now very generally agreed, that all we can know of 
Matter is the sensations which it gives us, and the 
order of occurrence of those sensations; and that 
while the substance Body is the unknown cause of 
our sensations, the substance Mind is the unknown 
percipient. 

The only remaining class of Nameable Things is 
Attributes; and these are of three kinds. Quality, 
Relation, and Quantity. Qualities, like substances, 
are known to us no otherwise than by the sensations 
or other states of consciousness which they excite ; 
and while, in compliance with common usage, we have 
continued to speak of them as a distinct class of 
Things, we showed that in predicating them no one 
means to predicate anjrthing but those sensations or 
states of consciousness, on which they may be said to 
be grounded, and by which alone they can be defined. 
Relations, except the simple cases of likeness and 
unlikeness, succession and simultaneity, are similarly 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



THINGS DENOTED BY NAMES. 101 

grounded upon some fact, or phenomenon, that is, 
upon some series of sensations or states of conscious- 
ness, more or less complicated. The third species 
of attribute^ Quantity, is also manifestly grounded 
upon something in our sensations or states of feel- 
ing, since there is an indubitable difference in the 
sensations excited by a larger and a smaller bulk, 
or by a greater or a less degree of intensity, in any 
object of sense or of consciousness. All attributes, 
therefore, are to us nothing but either our sensations 
and other states of feeling, or something inextricably 
involved therein; and to this even the peculiar and 
simple relations just adverted to are not exceptions. 
Those peculiar relations, however, are so important, 
and, even if they might in strictness be classed among 
our states of consciousness, are so fundamentally 
distinct from any other of those states, that it would 
be a vain subtlety to confound them under that 
conmion head, and it is necessary that they should be 
classed apart. 

As the result, therefore, of our analysis, we obtain 
the following as an enumeration and classification of 
all Nameable Things : — 

1st. Feelings, or States of Consciousness. 

2nd. The Minds which experience those feelings. 

3rd. The Bodies, or external objects, which excite 
certain of those feelings, .together with the powers or 
properties whereby they excite them ; these last being 
included rather in compliance with common opinion, 
and because their existence is taken for granted in the 
common language from which I cannot prudently 
deviate, than because the recognition of such powers 
or properties as real existences appears to me war-^ 
ranted by a sound philosophy. 

4th, and last. The Successions and Co-existences,

102 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

the Likenesses and Unlikenesses, between feelings or 
states of consciousness. Those relations, when con- 
sidered as subsisting between other things, exist in 
reality only between the states of consciousness which 
those things, if bodies, excite, if minds, either excite 
or experience. 

This, until a better can be suggested, must serve 
us as a substitute for the abortive Classification of 
Existences, termed the Categories of Aristotle. The 
practical application of it will appear when we com- 
mence the inquiry into the Import of Propositions; in 
other words, when we inquire what it is which the 
mind actually believes, when it gives what is called its 
assent to a proposition. 

These four classes comprising, if the classification 
be correct, all Nameable Things, these or some of 
them must of course compose the signification of all 
names ; and of these or some of them is made up 
whatever we call a fact. 

For distinction's sake, every fact which is solely 
composed of feelings or states of consciousness con- 
sidered as such, is often called a Psychological or 
Subjective fact ; while every fact which is composed, 
either wholly or in part, of something different from 
these, that is, of substances and attributes^ is called 
an Objective fact. We may say, then, that every 
objective fact is grounded on a corresponding sub- 
jective one; and has no meaning to us (apart from the 
subjective fact which corresponds to it), except as a 
name for the unknown and inscrutable process by 
which that subjective or psychological fact is brought 
to pass.

CHAPTER IV. 

OF PROPOSITIONS. 

f 1. In treating of Propositions, as already in 
treating of Names, some considerations of a compara- 
tively elementary nature respecting their form and 
varieties must be premised, before entering upon that 
analysis of the import conveyed by them, which is 
the real subject and purpose of this preliminary book. 

A proposition, we have before said, is a portion of 
discourse in which a predicate is aflSrmed or denied of 
a subject. A predicate and a subject are all that is 
necessarily required to make up a proposition : but as 
we cannot conclude from merely seeing two names put 
together, that they are a predicate and a subject, that 
is, that one of them is intended to be affirmed or denied 
of the other, it is necessary that there should be some 
mode or form of indicating that such is the intention ; 
some sign to distinguish a predication from any other 
kind of discourse. This is sometimes done by a 
slight alteration of one of the words, called an in- 
flearion; as, when we say. Fire burns ; the change of 
the second word from bum to bums showing that we 
mean to affirm the predicate burn of the subject fire. 
But this function is more commonly fulfilled by the 
word is, when an affirmation is intended, is not, when 
a negation ; or by some other part of the verb to be. 
The word which thus serves the purpose of a sign of 
predication is called, as we formerly observed, the 
copula. It is of the utmost importance that there 
should be no mdistinctness in our conception of the 
nature and office of the copula ; for confused notions 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



104 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

respecting it are among the causes which have spread 
mysticism over the field of logic, and perverted its 
speculations into logomachies. 

It is apt to be supposed that the copula is much 
more than a mere sign of predication ; that it also 
signifies existence. In the proposition, Socrates is 
just, it may seem to be implied not only that the 
quality ^'w^f can be affirmed of Socrates, but moreover 
that Socrates w, that is to say, exists. This, how- 
ever, only shows that there is an ambiguity in the 
word is; B, word which not only performs the function 
of the copula in affirmations, but has also a meaning 
of its own, in virtue of which it may itself be made 
the predicate of a proposition. That the employment 
of it as a copula does not necessarily include the 
affirmation of existence, appears from such a proposi- 
tion as this, A centaur is a fiction of the poets; 
where it cannot possibly be implied that a centaur 
exists, since the proposition itself expressly asserts 
that the thing has no real existence. 

Many volumes might be filled with the fiivolous 
speculations concerning the nature of Being {ro 6v, 
ovaia, Ens, Entitas, Essentia, and the like), which 
have arisen from overlooking this double meaning of 
the words to be; from supposing that when it signifies 
to existy and when it signifies to be some specified 
thing, as to be a man, to be Socrates, to be seen or 
spoken of, to be a phantom, even to be a nonentity, it 
must still, at bottom, answer to the same idea ; and 
that a meaning must be found for it which shall suit 
all these cases. The fog which rose from this narrow 
spot diffused itself at an early period over the whole 
surface of metaphysics. Yet it becomes us not to 
triumph over the gigantic intellects t)f Plato and 
Aristotle because we are now able to preserve ourselves

from many errors into which they, perhaps inevitably, 
fell. The fire-teazer of a modem steam-engine pro- 
duces by his exertions far greater effects than Milo of 
Crotona could, but he is not therefore a stronger 
man. The Greeks seldom knew any language but 
their own. This rendered it far more difficult for 
them than it is for us, to acquire a readiness in 
detecting ambiguities. One of the advantages of 
having systematically studied a plurality of languages, 
especially of those languages which philosophers have 
used as the vehicle of their thoughts, is the practical 
lesson we learn respecting the ambiguities of words, by 
finding that the same word in one language corre- 
sponds, on different occasions, to different words in 
another. When not thus exercised, even the strongest 
understandings find it difficult to believe that things 
which have a common name, have not in some respect 
or other a common nature ; and often expend much 
labour not only unprofitably but mischievously (as 
was frequently done by the two philosophers just 
mentioned), on vain attempts to discover in what this 
common nature consists. But, the habit once formed, 
intellects much inferior are capable of detecting even 
ambiguities which are common to many languages : 
and it is surprising that the one now under considera- 
tion, though it exists in the modem languages as well 
as in the ancient^ should have been overlooked by 
almost all authors. The quantity of futile speculation 
which had been caused by a misapprehension of the 
nature of the copula, was hinted at by Hobbes ; but 
Mr. Mill* was, I believe, the first who distinctly 
characterized the ambiguity, and pointed out how 
many errors in the received systems of philosophy it

106 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

has had to answer for. It has indeed misled the 
moderns scarcely less than the ancients, though their 
mistakes, because our understandings are not yet so 
completely emancipated from their influence, do not 
appear equally ridiculous. 

We shall now briefly review the principal distinc- 
tions which exist among propositions, and the technical 
terms most commonly in use to express those dis- 
tinctions. 

$ 2. A proposition being a portion of discourse 
in which something is affirmed or denied of something, 
the first division of propositions is into affirmative 
and negative. An affirmative proposition is that in 
which the predicate is affirmed of the subject ; as, 
Caesar is dead. A negative proposition is that in 
which the predicate is denied of the subject; as, 
Caesar is not dead. The copula, in this last species 
of proposition, consists of the words is not^ which are 
the sign of negation ; is being the sign of affirmation. 

Some logicians, among whom may be mentioned 
Hobbes, state this distinction dififerently ; they recog- 
nize only one form of copula, is, and attach the nega- 
tive sign to the predicate. ** Caesar is dead,*' and 
" Caesar is not dead," according to these writers, are 
propositions agreeing not in the subject and predicate, 
but in the subject only. They do not consider 
*'dead,*' but *'not dead,'' to be the predicate of the 
second proposition, and they accordingly define a 
negative proposition to be one in which the predicate 
is a negative name. The point, though not of much 
practical moment, deserves notice as an example (not 
unfrequent in logic) where by means of an apparent 
simplification, but which is merely verbal, matters are 
made more complex than before. The idea of these

PROPOSITIONS. 107 

writers was, that they could get rid of the distinction 
between affirming and denying, by treating every case 
of denying as the affirming of a negative name. But 
what is meant by a negative name ? A name expres- 
sive of the absence of an attribute. So that when we 
affirm a negative name, what we are really predicating 
is absence and not presence ; we are asserting not that 
anything is, but that something is not; to express 
which operation no word seems so proper as the word 
denying. The fundamental distinction is between a 
fact and the non-existence of that fact; between 
seeing something and not seeing it, between Caesar's 
being dead and his not being dead ; and if this were a 
merely verbal distinction, the generalization which 
brings both within the same form of assertion would 
be a real simplification: the distinction, however, 
being real, and in the facts, it is the generalization 
confounding the distinction that is merely verbal ; and 
tends to obscure the subject, by treating the difference 
between two kinds of truths as if it were only a dif- 
ference between two kinds of words. To put things 
together, and to put them or keep them asunder, will 
remain different operations, whatever tricks we may 
play with language. 

A remark of a similar nature may be appUed to 
most of those distinctions among propositions which 
are said to have reference to their modality : as, differ- 
ence of tense or time ; the sun did rise, the sun is 
rising, the sun mil rise. All these difierences, Uke 
that between affirmation and negation, might be 
glossed over by considering the incident of time as a 
mere modification of the predicate : thus, The sun is 
an object having risen. The sun is an object notv rising, 
The sun is on object to rise hereafter. But the simpli- 
fication would be merely verbal. Past, present, or

108 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

future, do not constitute so maiiy different kinds of 
rising ; they are designations belonging to the event 
asserted, to the sun^s rising to-day. They aflfect, not 
the predicate, but the applicability of the predicate to 
the particular subject. That which we affirm to be 
past, present, or future, is not what the subject signi- 
fies, nor what the predicate signifies, but specifically 
and expressly what the predication signifies ; what is 
expressed only by the proposition, as such, and not by 
either or both of the terms. Therefore the circum- 
stance of time is properly considered as attaching to 
the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not 
to the predicate. If the same cannot be said of such 
modifications as these, Caesar may be dead ; Caesar is 
perhaps dead ; It is possible that Caesar is dead ; it is 
only because these fall altogether under another head, 
being properly assertions not of anything relating to 
the fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in 
regard to it ; namely, our absence of disbelief of it. 
ITius ** Caesar may be dead'^ means ** I am not sure 
that Caesar is alive.*' 

§ 3. The next division of propositions is into 
Simple and Complex. A simple proposition is that 
in which one predicate is affirmed or denied of one 
subject. A complex proposition is that in which 
there is more than one predicate, or more than one 
subject, or both. 

At first sight this decision has the air of an absur- 
dity; a solemn distinction of things into one and 
more than one ; as if we were to divide horses into 
single horses and teams of horses. And it is true that 
what is called a complex proposition is often not a 
proposition at all, but several propositions, held toge- 
ther by a conjunction. Sucly, for example, is this.

PROPOSITIONS. 109 

Caesar is deadi and Brutus is alive: or even this, 
Caesar is dead, but Brutus is alive. There are here 
two distinct assertions ; and we might as well call a 
street a complex house, as these two propositions a 
complex proposition. It is true that the S3mcategore- 
matic words and and but have a meaning; but that 
meaning is so far from making the two propositions 
one, that it adds a third proposition to them. All 
particles are abbreviations, and generally abbreviations 
of propositions ; a kind of short-hand, whereby that 
which, to be expressed fully, would have required a 
proposition or a series of propositions, is suggested to 
the mind at once. Thus the words, Caesar is dead 
and Brutus is alive, are equivalent to these : Caesar is 
dead ; Brutus is alive ; it is my wish that the two pre- 
ceding propositions should be thought of together. If 
the words were, Caesar is dead but Brutus is alive, the 
sense would be equivalent to the same three propo- 
sitions together with a fourth; '* between the two 
preceding propositions there exists a contrast :" viz., 
either between the two facts themselves, or between 
the feelings with which it is my wish that they should 
be regarded. 

In the instances cited, the two propositions are 
kept visibly distinct, each subject having its separate 
predicate, and each predicate its separate subject. 
For brevity, however, and to avoid repetition, the pro- 
positions are often blended together: as in this, 
" Peter and James preached at Jerusalem and in Gali- 
lee," which contains four propositions : Peter preached 
at Jerusalem, Peter preached in Galilee, James 
preached at Jerusalem, James preached in Galilee. 

We have seen that when the two or more propo- 
sitions comprising what is called a complex propo- 
sition, are stated absolutely, and not under any

110 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

condition or proviso, it is not a proposition at all, 
but a plurality of propositions; since what it expresses 
is not a single assertion, but several assertions, which, 
if true when joined, are true also when separated. 
But there is a kind of proposition which, although it 
contains a plurality of subjects and of predicates, and 
may be said in one sense of the word to consist of 
several propositions, contains but one assertion ; and 
its truth does not at all imply that of the simple pro- 
positions which compose it. An example of this is, 
when the simple propositions are connected by the 
particle or; as, either A is B or C is D ; or by the 
particle if; as A is B if C is D. In the former case, 
the proposition is called disjunctiv€y in the latter 
conditional: the name hypothetical was originally 
common to both. As has been well remarked by 
Archbishop Whately and others, the disjunctive form 
is resolvable into the conditional ; every disjunctive 
proposition being equivalent to two or more condi- 
tional ones. ** Either A is B or C is D," means, 
'' if A is not B, C is D; and if C is not D, A is B." 
All hypothetical propositions, therefore, though dis- 
junctive in form, are conditional in meaning; and the 
words hypothetical and conditional may be, as indeed 
they generally are, used synonymously. Propositions 
in which the assertion is not dependent upon a condi- 
tion, are said, in the language of logicians, to be 
categorical. 

An hypothetical proposition is not, like the pre- 
tended complex propositions which we previously 
considered, a mere aggregation of simple propositions. 
The simple propositions which form part of the words 
in which it is couched, form no part of the assertion 
which it conveys. When we say, If the Koran comes 
from God, Mahomet is the prophet of God, we do not

PROPOSITIONS. 1 1 1 

intend to affirm either that the Koran does come from 
God, or that Mahomet is really his prophet. Neither 
of these simple propositions may be true, and yet the 
truth of the hypothetical proposition may be indis- 
putable. What is asserted is not the truth of either 
of the propositions, but the inferribility of the one 
from the other. What, then, is the subject, and what 
the predicate, of the hypothetical proposition ? " The 
Koran " is not the subject of it, nor is ** Mahomet:'* 
for nothing is affirmed or denied either of the Koran 
or of Mahomet. The real subject of the predication 
is the entire proposition, ** Mahomet is the prophet of 
God ;" and the affirmation is, that this is a legitimate 
inference from the proposition, " The Koran comes 
from God." The subject and predicate, therefore, of 
an hypothetical proposition are names of propositions. 
The subject is some one proposition. The predicate 
is a general relative name applicable to propositions ; 
of this form — *'an inference from so and so." A 
fresh instance is here aflforded of the remark, that all 
particles are abbrenations; since "ijf A isB, C isD," 
is found to be an abbreviation of the following : *' The 
proposition C is D, is a legitimate inference from the 
proposition A is B." 

The distinction, therefore, between hypothetical 
and categorical propositions is not so great as it at 
first appears. In the conditional, as well as in the 
categorical form, one predicate is affirmed of one 
subject, and no more : but a conditional proposition \ 
is a proposition concerning a proposition; the subject 
of the assertion is itself an assertion. Nor is this a 
property peculiar to hypothetical propositions. There 
are other classes of assertions concerning propositions. 
Like other things, a proposition has attributes which 
may be predicated of it. The attribute predicated of

112 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

it in .an hypothetical proposition^ is that of being in 
inference from a certain other proposition. But this 
s only one of many attributes that might be predi- 
cated. We may say, That the whole is greater than 
its part, is an axiom in mathematics : That the Holy 
Ghost proceeds from the Father alone, is a tenet of 
the Greek Church : The doctrine of the divine right 
of kings was renounced by Parliament at the Revolu- 
tion : The infallibility of the Pope has no countenance 
from Scripture. In all these cases the subject of the 
predication is an entire proposition. That which these 
different predicates are affirmed of, is the proposition y 
'* the whole is greater than its part ;'' the propositioUy 
" the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father alone ;" 
the proposition^ "kings have a divine right;'* the 
proposition, ** the Pope is infallible/' 

Seeing, then, that there is much less difference 
between hjrpothetical propositions and any others, 
than one might be led to imagine from their form, 
we should be at a loss to account for the conspicuous 
position which they have been selected to fill in 
treatises on Logic, if we did not remember that what 
they predicate of a proposition, namely, its being an 
inference from something else, is precisely that one of 
its attributes with which most of all a logician is 
concerned. 

$ 4. The next of the common divisions of Propo- 
sitions is into Universal, Particular, Indefinite, and 
Singular : a distinction founded upon "the degree of 
generality in which the name, which is the subject of 
the proposition, is to be understood. The following 
are examples : 



Digitized

PROPOSITIONS. 113 

All men are mortal — Universal. 

Some men are mortal — Particular. 

Man is mortal — Indefinite. 

Julii^ Ccesar is mortal — Singular. 
The proposition is Singular, when the subject is 
an individual name. The individual name needs not 
be a proper name. '* The Founder of Christianity 
was crucified/' is as much a singular proposition as 
" Christ was crucified." 

When the name, which is the subject of the 
proposition, is a general name, we may intend to 
affirm or deny the predicate, either of all the things 
that the subject denotes, or only of some. When the 
predicate is affirmed or denied of all and each of the 
things denoted by the subject, the proposition is uni- 
versa! ; when of some non-assignable portion of them 
only, it is particular. Thus, All men are mortal ; Every 
man is mortal ; are universal propositions. No man 
is inmiortal, is also an universal proposition, since the 
predicate, immortal, is denied of each and every 
individual denoted by the term man; the negative 
proposition being exactly equivalent to the following, 
Every man is not-immortal. But ** some men are 
wise,'' *^some men are not wise," are particular 
propositions ; the predicate loise being in the one case 
affirmed and in the other denied not of each and 
every individual denoted by the term man, but only 
of each and every one of some portion of those indi- 
viduals, without specifying what portion ; for if this 
were specified, the proposition would be changed 
either into a singular proposition, or into an universal 
proposition with a different subject ; as, for instance, 
•* all instructed men are wise." There are other forms 
of particular propositions : as, ^^Most men are incapable 
of self-government." it being immaterial how large a 
VOL. I. ' r- T

114 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

portion of the subject the predicate is asserted of, as 
long as it is left uncertain how that portion is to be 
distinguished from the rest. 

When the form of the expression does not clearly 
show whether the general name which is the subject 
of the proposition is meant to stand for all the indi- 
viduals denoted by it, or only for some of them, the 
proposition is commonly called Indefinite ; but this, 
as Archbishop Whately observes, is a solecism, of the 
same nature as that committed by some grammarians 
when in their list of genders they enumerate the 
doubtful gender. The speaker must mean to assert 
the proposition either as an universal or as a particular 
proposition, though he has failed to declare which : 
and it often happens that though the words do not 
show which of the two he intends, the context, or the 
custom of speech, supplies the deficiency. Thus, 
when it is affirmed that "Man is mortal," nobody 
doubts that the assertion is intended of all human 
beings, and the word indicative of universality is com- 
monly omitted only because the meaning is evident 
without it. 

When a general name stands for each and every 
individual which it is a name of, or in other words, 
which it denotes, it is said by logicians to be distri- 
buted, or taken distributively. Thus, in the propo- 
sition, All men are mortal, the subject, Man, is 
distributed, because mortality is affirmed of each and 
every man. The predicate, Mortal, is not distributed, 
because the only mortals who are spoken of in the 
proposition are those who happen to be men ; while 
the word may, for aught that appears (and in feet 
does), comprehend under it an indefinite number of 
objects besides men. In the proposition. Some men 
are mortal, both the predicate and the subject are

undistributed. In the following, No men are perfect, 
both the predicate and subject are distributed. Not 
only is the attribute perfection denied of the entire 
class Man, but that class is severed and cast out from 
the whole of the class Perfect, and not merely from 
some part of that class. 

This phraseology, which is of great service in 
stating and demonstrating the rules of the syllogism, 
enables us to express very concisely the definitions of 
an universal and a particular proposition. An uni- 
versal proposition is that of which the subject is 
distributed ; a particular proposition is that of which 
the subject is undistributed. 

There are many more distinctions among pro- 
positions than those we have here stated, some of 
them of considerable importance. But, for explaining 
and illustrating these, more suitable opportunities will 
occur in the sequel.

Chapter V. 
OF THE IMPORT OF PROrOSITIONS. 

§ 1. An inquiry into the nature of Propositions 
must have one of two objects : to analyze the state 
of mind called Belief, or to analyze what is believed. 
All language recognizes a difference between a doctrine 
or opinion, and the act of entertaining the opinion; 
between assent, and what is assented to. 

Lo^c, according to the conception here formed 
of it, has no concern with the nature of the act of 
judging or believing; the consideration of that act, 
as a phenomenon of the mind, belongs to another 
science. Philosophers, however, from Descartes 
downwards, and especially from the era of Leibnitz 
and Locke, have by no means observed this dis- 
tinction; and would have treated with great disre- 
spect any attempt to analyze the import of Pro- 
positions, unless founded upon an analysis of the 
act of Judgment. A Proposition, they would have 
said, is but the expression in words of a Judgment. 
The thing expressed, not the mere verbal expression, 
is the important matter. When the mind assents to 
a proposition, it judges. Let us find out what the 
mind does when it judges, and we shall know what 
propositions mean, and not otherwise. 

Conformably to these views, almost all the writers 
on Logic in the last two centuries, whether English, 
German, or French, have made their theory of Pro- 
positions, from one end to the other, a theory of 
Judgments. They considered a Proposition, or a 
Judgment, for they used the two words indiscrimi- 
nately, to consist in affirming or denying one idea of

another. To judge, was to put two ideas together, or 
to bring one idea under another, or to compare two 
ideas, or to perceive the agreement or disagreiement 
between two ideas : and the whole doctrine of Propo- 
sitions, together with the theory of Reasoning (always 
necessarily founded upon the theory of Propositions), 
was stated as if Ideas, or Conceptions, or whatever 
other term the writer preferred as a name for mental 
representations generally, constituted essentially the 
subject matter and substance of those operations. 

It is, of course, true, that in any case of judg- 
ment, as for instance when we judge that gold is 
yellow, a process takes place in our minds of which 
some one or other of these theories is a partially 
correct account. We must have the idea of gold and 
the idea of yellow, and these two ideas must be 
brought together in our mind. But in the first place, 
it is evident that this is only a p&rt of what takes 
place; for we may put two ideas together without any 
act of belief; as when we merely imagine something, 
such as a golden mountain; or when we actually 
disbelieve: for in order even to disbelieve that 
Mahomet was an apostle of God, we must. put the 
idea of Mahomet and that of an apostle of God 
together. To determine what it is that happens 
in the case of assent or dissent besides putting two 
ideas together, is one of the most intricate of meta- 
physical problems. But whatever the solution may 
be, we may venture to assert that it can have nothing 
whatever to do with the import of propositions ; for 
this reason, that propositions (except where the mind 
itself is the subject treated of) are not assertions 
respecting our ideas of things, but assertions respect- 
ing the things themselves. In order to believe 
that gold is yellow, I must, indeed, have the idea of

gold, and the idea of yellbw, and something having 
reference to those ideas must take place in my mind; 
but my belief has not reference to the ideas, it has 
reference to the things. What I believe is a fiact 
relating to the outward thing, gold, and to the impres- 
sion made by that outward thing upon the human 
organs ; not a fact relating to my conception of gold, 
which would be a fact in my mental history, not a 
fact of external nature. It is true, that in order to 
believe this fact in external nature, another fact must 
take place in my mind, a process must be performed 
upon my ideas ; but so it must in everything else that 
I do. I cannot dig the ground unless I have the idea 
of the groimd, and of a spade, and of aU the other 
things I am operating upon, and unless I put those 
ideas together. But it would be a very ridiculous 
description of digging the ground to say that it is 
putting one idea* into another. Digging is an opera- 
tion which is performed upon the things themselves, 
although it cannot be performed unless I have in my 
mind the ideas of them. And so, in like manner, 
believing is an act which has for its subject the facts 
themselves, although a previous mental conception of 
the facts is an indispensable condition. When I say 
that fire causes heat, do I mean that my idea of fire 
causes my idea of heat ? No : I mean that the 
natural phenomenon, fire, causes the natural pheno- 
menon, heat. When I mean to assert anything re- 
specting the ideas, I give them their proper name, I 
call them ideas : as when I say, that a child's idea 
of a battle is unlike the reality, or that the ideas 
entertained of the Deity have a great efiect on the 
characters of mankind. 

The notion that what is of primary importance to 
the logician in a proposition, is the relation between

the two ide€i8 corresponding to the subject and predi- 
cate (instead of the relation between the two pheno- 
mena which they respectively express), seems to me 
one of the most fatal errors ever introduced into the 
philosophy of Logic ; and the principal cause why the 
theory of the science has made such inconsiderable 
progress during the last two centuries. The treatises 
on Logic, and on the branches of Mental Philosophy 
connected with Logic, which have been produced since 
the intrusion of this cardinal error, though sometimes 
written by men of extraordinary abilities and attain- 
ments, almost always tacitly imply a theory that the 
investigation of truth consists in contemplating and 
handling our ideas, or conceptions of things, instead 
of the things themselves : a process by which, I will 
venture to affirm, not a single truth ever was arrived ' 
at, excepf truths of psychology, a science of which 
Ideas or Conceptions are avowedly (along with other 
mental phenomena) the subject-matter. Meanwhile, 
inquiries into every kind of natural phenomena were 
incessantly establishing great and fruitful truths on the 
most important subjects, by processes upon which these 
views of the nature of Judgment and Reasoning threw 
no light, and in which they afforded no assistance 
whatever. No wonder that those who knew by prac- 
tical experience how truths are come at, should deem 
a science futile, which consisted chiefly of such specu- 
lations. What has been done for the advancement of 
Logic since these doctrines came into vogue, has been 
done not by professed logicians, but by discoverers in 
the other sciences ; in whose methods of investigation 
many great principles of logic, not previously thought 
of, have successively come forth into light, but who 
have generally committed the error of supposing that 
nothing whatever was known of the art of philoso-

phizing by the old logicians, because their modern inter- 
preters have written to so little purpose respecting it. 
We have to inquire, then, on the present occasion, 
not into Judgment, but judgments ; not into the act 
of believing, but into the thing believed. What is 
the immediate object of belief in a Proposition? What 
is the matter of fact signi6ed by it ? What is it to 
which, when I assert the proposition, I give my assent, 
and call upon others to give theirs? What is that 
which is expressed by the form of discourse called a 
Proposition, and the conformity of which to fact coa- 
stitutes the truth of the proposition ? 

$ 2. One of the clearest and most consecutive 
thinkers whom this country or the world has pro- 
duced, I mean Hobbes, has given the following answer 
to this question. In every proposition (says he), what 
is signified is, the belief of the speaker that the predi- 
cate is a name of the same thing of which the subject 
is a name ; and if it really is so, the proposition is 
true. Thus the proposition. All men are living 
beings (he would say), is true, because living being 
is a name of everything of which man is a name. All 
men are six feet high is not true, because six feet high 
is not a name of everything (though it is of some 
things) of which man is a name. 

What is stated by Hobbes as the definition of a 
true proposition, must be allowed to be a property 
V hich all true propositions possess. The subject and 
predicate being both of them names of things, if they 
were names of quite different things the one name could 
not, consistently with its signification, be predicated 
of the other. If it be true that some men are copper- 
coloured, it must be true — and the proposition does 
really assert — that among the individuals denoted by

IMPORT OF PROPOSITIONS. 121 

the name Dian, there are some who are also among 
those denoted by the name copper-coloured. If it be 
true that all oxen ruminate, it must be true that all the 
individuals denoted by the name ox are also among 
those denoted by the name ruminating ; and whoever 
asserts that all oxen ruminate, undoubtedly does assert 
that this relation subsists between the two names. 

The assertion, therefore, which, according to 
Hobbes, is the only one made in any proposition, really 
is made in every proposition : and his analysis has 
consequently one of the requisites for being the true 
one. We may go a step farther; it is the only 
analysis that is rigorously true of all propositions 
without exception. What he gives as the meaning 
of propositions, is part of the meaning of all propo- 
sitions, and the whole meaning of some. This, how- 
ever, only shows what an extremely minute fragment 
of meaning it is quite possible to include within the 
logical formula of a proposition. It does not show 
that no proposition means more. To warrant us in 
putting together two words with a copula between 
them, it is really enough that the thing or things 
denoted by one of the names should be capable, 
without violation of usage, of being called by the 
other name also. If then this be all the meaning 
necessarily implied in the form of discourse called a 
"Proposition, why do I object to it as the scientific 
definition of what a proposition means?- Because, 
though the mere collocation which makes the propo- 
sition a proposition, conveys no more meaning than 
Hobbes contends for, that same collocation combined 
with other circumstances, that /orm combined with 
other matter^ does convey more, and much more. 

The only propositions of which Hobbes' principb 
is a sufficient account, are that limited and unim-

122 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

portant class in which both the predicate and the 
subject are proper names. For, as has already been 
remarked, proper names have strictly no meaning; 
they are mere marks for individual objects: and 
when a proper name is predicated of another proper 
name, all the signification conveyed is, that both the 
names are marks for the same object. But this is 
precisely what Hobbes produces as a theory of predi- 
cation in general. His doctrine is a full explanation 
of such predications as these : Hyde was Clarendon, 
or, TuUy is Cicero. It exhausts the meaning of those 
propositions. But it is a sadly inadequate theory of 
any others. That it should ever have been thought 
of as such, can be accounted for only by the fact, that 
Hobbes, in common with the other Nominalists, 
bestowed little or no attention upon the connotation of 
words; and sought for their meaning exclusively in 
what they denote: as if all names had been (what none 
but proper names really are) marks put upon indivi- 
duals; and as if there were no difference between a 
proper and a general name, except that the first denotes 
only one individual, and the last a greater number. 

It has been seen, however, that the meaning of all 
names, except proper names and that portion of the 
class of abstract names which are not connotative, 
resides in the connotation. When, therefore, we are 
analjTsing the meaning of any proposition in which 
the predicate and the subject, or either of them, are 
connotative names, it is to the connotation of those 
terms that we must exclusively look, and not to what 
they denote, or in the language of Hobbes, (language 
so far correct) are names of. 

In asserting that the truth of a proposition depends 
upon the conformity of import between its terms, as, 
for instance, that the proposition, Socrates is wise,

IMPORT OP PROPOSITIONS. 123 

is a true proposition^ because Socrates and wise are 
names applicable to, or, as he expresses it^ names 
of, the same person; it is very remarkable that so 
powerful a thinker should not have asked himself 
the question, But how came they to be names of the 
same person ? Surely not because such was the inten- 
tion of those who invented the words. When man- 
kind fixed the meaning of the word wise, they were 
not thinking of Socrates, nor when his parents gave 
him the name Socrates, were they thinking of wisdom. 
The names happen to fit the same person because of a 
certain fact, which fact was not known, nor in being, 
when the names were invented. If we want to know 
what the fact is, we shall find the due to it in the 
connotation of the names. 

A bird, or a stone, a man, or a wise man, means 
simply, an object having such and such attributes. 
The real meaning of the word man, is those attributes, 
and not John, Peter, Thomas, &c. The word mortal^ 
in like manner connotes a certain attribute or attri- 
butes; and when we say. All men are mortal, the 
meaning of the proposition is, that all beings which 
possess the one set of attributes, possess also the 
other. If, in our experience, the attributes connoted 
by man are always accompanied by the attribute con- 
noted by mortal, it will follow as a consequence, that 
the class man will be wholly included in the class 
mortal, and that mortal will be a name of all things of 
which man is a name : but why? Those objects are 
brought under the name, by possessing the attributes 
connoted by it : but their possession of the attributes 
is the real condition on which the truth of the propo- 
sition depends ; not their being called by the name. 
Connotative names do not precede, but follow, the 
attributes which they connote. If one attribute hap-

pens to be always found in conjunction with another 
attribute, the concrete names which answer to those 
attributes will of course be predicable of the same 
subjects, and may be said, in Hobbes* language (in the 
propriety of which on this occasion I fully concur), to 
be two names for the same things. But the possi- 
bility of a concurrent application of the two names, is 
a mere consequence of the conjunction between the 
two attributes, and was, in most cases, never thought 
of when the names were invented and their significa- 
tion fixed. That the diamond is combustible, was a 
proposition certainly not dreamt of when the words 
Diamond and Combustible received their present mean- 
ing ; and could not have been discovered by^the most 
ingenious and refined analysis of the .signification of 
those words. It was found out by a very diflferent 
process, namely, by exerting the five senses, and 
learning from them, that the attribute of combustibility 
existed in all those diamonds upon which ^the experi- 
ment was tried ; these being so numerous, [and the 
circumstances of the experiments such, that what was 
true of those individuals might be concluded to be 
true of all substances " coming within the'"name," that 
is, of all substances possessing the attributes which 
the name connotes. The assertion, therefore, when 
analysed, is, that wherever we find certain attributes, 
there will be foimd a certain other attribute: which 
is not a question of the signification of names, but 
of the laws of nature; the order existing among 
phenomena. 

$ 3. Although Hobbes' theory of Predication has 
not, in the terms in which he stated it, met with a 
very favourable reception from .philosophers, a theory 
virtually identical with it, and not by any means so

IMPORT OF PROPOSITIONS. 125 

perspicuously expressed, may almost be said to have 
taken the rank of an established opinion. The most 
generally received notion of Predication decidedly is, 
that it consists in referring something to a class, i. e., 
either placing an individual under a class, or placing 
one class under another class. Thus, the proposition, 
Man is mortal, asserts, according to this view of it, 
that the class man is included in the class mortal. 
" Plato is a philosopher," asserts that the individual 
Plato is one of those who compose the class philo- 
sopher. If the proposition is negative, then instead 
of placing something in a class, it is said to exclude 
something from a class. Thus, if the following be the 
proposition, The elephant is not carnivorous ; what is 
asserted (according to this theory) is, that the elephant 
is excluded from the class carnivorous, or is not 
numbered among the things comprising that class. 
There is no real diflerence except in language, between 
this theory of Predication and the theory of Hobbes. 
For a class is absolutely nothing but an indefinite 
number of individuals denoted by a general name. 
The name given to them in common, is what makes 
them a class. To refer anything to a class, therefore, 
is to look upon it as one of the things which are to 
be called by that common name. To exclude it from 
a class, is to say that the common name is not appli- 
cable to it. 

How widely these views of predication have pre- 
vailed, is evident from this, that they are the basis of 
the celebrated Dictum de omni et nullo. When the 
syllogism is resolved, by all who treat of it, into an 
inference that what is true of a class is true of all 
things whatever that belong to the class ; and when 
this is laid down by almost all professed logicians as 
the ultimate principle to which all reasoning owes its

126 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

validity ; it is clear that in the general estimation of 
logicians, the propositions of which reasonings are 
composed can be the expression of nothing but the 
process of dividing things into classes, and referring 
everything to its proper class. 

This theory appears to me a signal example of a 
logical error very often committed in logic, that of 
virrepoy irporepovy or explaining a thing by something 
which presupposes it. When I say that snow is 
white, I may and ought to be thinking of snow as a 
class, because I am asserting a proposition as true of 
all snow : but I am certainly not thinking of white 
objects as a class ; I am thinking of no white object 
whatever except snow, but only of that, and of the 
sensation of white which it gives me. When, indeed, 
I have judged, or assented to the propositions, that 
snow is white, and that several other things also are 
white, I gradually begin to think of white objects as a 
class, including snow and those other things. But 
this is a conception which followed, not preceded, 
those judgments, and therefore cannot be given as an 
explanation of them. Instead of explaining the effect 
by the cause, this doctrine explains the cause by the 
effect, and is, I conceive, founded upon a latent 
misconception of the nature of classification. 

There is a sort of language very generally pre- 
valent in these discussions, which seems to suppose 
that classification is an arrangement and grouping 
of definite and known individuals : that when names 
were imposed, mankind took into consideration all 
the individual objects in the universe, made them up 
into parcels or lists, and gave to the objects of each 
list a common name, repeating this operation toties 
quoties until they had invented all the general names 
of which language consists ; which having been once

done, if a question subsequently arises whether a 
certain general name can be truly predicated of a 
certain particular object, we have only (as it were) to 
read the roll of the objects upon which that name 
was conferred, and see whether the object about which 
the question arises, is to be found among them. The 
iramers of language (it would seem to be supposed) 
have predetermined all the objects that are to compose 
each class^ and we have only to refer to the record of 
an antecedent decision. 

So absurd a doctrine will be owned by nobody 
when thus nakedly stated; but if the commonly 
received explanations of classification and naming do 
not imply this theory, it requires to be shown how 
they admit of being reconciled with any other. 

General names are not marks put upon definite 
objects ; classes are not made by drawing a line roimd 
a given number of assignable individuals. The objects 
which compose any given class are perpetually fluc- 
tuating. We may frame a class without knowing the 
individuals, or even any of the individuals, of which it 
will be composed; we may do so while believing that 
no such individuals exist. If by the meaning of a 
general name are to be understood the things which it 
is the name of, no general name, except by accident, 
has a fixed meaning at all, or ever long retains the 
same meaning. The only mode in which any general 
name has a definite meaning, is by being a name of an 
indefinite variety of things, namely, of all things, 
known or unknown, past, present, or future, which 
possess certain definite attributes. When, by studying 
not the meaning of words, but the phenomena of 
nature, we discover that these attributes are possessed 
by some object not previously known to possess them, 
(as when chemists found that the diamond was com-

bustible), we include this new object in the class ; but 
it did not already belong to the class. We place the 
individual in the class because the proposition is true ; 
the proposition is not true because the object is placed 
in the class. 

It will appear hereafter in treating of reasoning, 
how much the theory of that intellectual process has 
been vitiated by the influence of these erroneous 
views, and by the habit which they exemplify of 
assimilating all the operations of the human imder- 
standing which have truth for their object, to 
processes of mere classification and naming. Un- 
fortunately, the minds which have been entangled in 
this net are precisely those which have escaped the 
other cardinal error commented upon in the beginning 
of the present chapter. Since the revolution which 
dislodged Aristotle from the schools, logicians may 
almost be divided into those who have looked upon 
reasoning as essentially an affair of Ideas, and those 
who have looked upon it as essentially an affair of 
Names. 

One thing it is but just to remark. Although 
Hobbes^ theory of Predication, according to the well 
known remark of Leibnitz, and the avowal of Hobbes 
himself*, renders truth and falsity completely arbi- 
trary, with no standard but the will of men, it must 
not be concluded, that either Hobbes, or any of the 
other philosophers who have in the main agreed with 
him, did, in fact, consider the distinction between 



* ^* From hence also this may be deduced, that the first truths 
were arbitrarily made by those that first of all imposed names upon 
things, or received them from the imposition of others. For it is 
true (for example) that man ii a living crecUtMre^ but it is for this 
reason, that it pleased men to impose both these names on the same 
thing." — Computation or Logic, ch. iii., sect. 8.

truth and error as less real, or attached one jot less of 
importance to it, than other people. To suppose that 
they did so would argue total unacquaintance with 
their other speculations. But this shows how little 
hold their doctrine possessed over their own minds. 
No person at bottom ever imagined that there was 
nothing more in truth than propriety of expression ; 
than using language in conformity to a previous 
convention. With whatever illusions even profound 
thinkers may have satisfied themselv^ when engaged 
in finding a general solution for a^metaphysical pro- 
blem ; when they came to the practical application of 
their doctrines, they were always prepared with some 
means of explaining the solution away. When the 
inquiry was brought down from generals to a parti- 
cular case, it has always been acknowledged that 
there is a distinction between verbal and real ques- 
tions ; that some false propositions are uttered from 
ignorance of the meaning of words, but that in others 
the source of the error is a misapprehension of things; 
that a person who has not the use of language at all 
may form propositions mentally, and that they may 
be untrue, that is, he may believe as matters of fact 
what are not really so. This last admission cannot 
be made in stronger terms than it is by Hobbes 
himself*; though he will not allow such erroneous

belief to be called falsity, but only error. And, more- 
over, he has himself laid down, in other places, 
doctrines in which the true theory of predication is 
by implication contained. He distinctly says that 
general names are given to things on account of their 
attributes, and that abstract names are the names of 
those attributes. "Abstract is that which in any 
subject denotes the cause of the concrete name . . 
And these causes of names are the same with the 
causes of our conceptions, namely, some power of 
action, or affection, of the thing conceived, which 
some call the manner by which anything works upon 
our senses, but by most men they are called acci- 
dents^.'^ It is strange that having gone so far, he 
should not have gone one step farther, and seen that 
what he calls the cause of the concrete name, is in 
reality the meaning of it ; and that when we predicate 
of any subject a name which is given because of an 
attribute (or, as he calls it, an accident), our object is 
not to affirm the name, but, by means of the name, 
to affirm the attribute. 

$ 4. Let the predicate be, as we have said, a con- 
notative term ; and to take the simplest case first, let 
the subject be a proper name : *' The summit of 
Chimborazo is white.*' The word white connotes an 
attribute which is possessed by the individual object 
designated by the words, *' summit of Chimborazo,'' 
which attribute consists in the physical fact, of its 



and such; or, lastly, when from any sign we vainly imagine some- 
thing to be signified which is not. And errors of this sort are 
common to all things that have sense." — Computation or Logicy

exciting in human beinga the sensation which we call 
a sensation of white. It will be admitted that, by 
asserting the proposition, we wish to communicate 
information of that physical fact, and are not thinking 
of the names, exc^t as the necessary means of 
making that communication. The meaning of the 
proposition, therefore, is, that the individual thing 
denoted by the subject, has the attributes connoted 
by the predicate. 

If we now suppose the subject also to be a con- 
notative name, the meaning expressed by the propo- 
sition has advanced a step farther in complication. 
Let us first suppose the proposition to be universal, 
as well as affirmative: **A11 men are mortal." In 
this case, as in the last, what the proposition asserts 
(or expresses a belief in), is, of course, that the objects 
denoted by the subject (man) possess the attributes 
connoted by the predicate (mortal). But the charac- 
teristic of this case is, that the objects are no longer 
individually designated. They are pointed out only 
by some of their attributes : they are the objects called 
men, that is, the beings possessing the attributes con- 
noted by the name man ; and the only thing known 
of them may be those attributes: indeed, as the 
proposition is general, and the objects denoted by the 
subject are therefore indefinite in number, most of 
them are not known individually at all. The asser- 
tion, therefore, is not, as before, that the attributes 
which the predicate connotes are possessed by any 
given individual, or by any number of individuals 
previously known as John, Thomas, Richard, &c., but 
that those attributes are possessed by each and every 
individual possessing certain other attributes; that 
whatever has the attributes connoted by the subject, 
has also those connoted by the predicate; that the

latter set of attributes constantly accompany the former 
set. Whatever has the attributes of man has the 
attribute of mortality; mortality constantly accom- 
panies the attributes of man. 

If it be remembered that every attribute is grounded 
upon some fact or phenomenon, either of outward 
sense or of inward consciousness, and that to possess 
an attribute is another phrase for being the cause of, 
or forming part of, the fact or phenomenon upon 
which the attribute is grounded ; we may add one 
more step to complete the analysis. The proposition 
which asserts that one attribute always accompanies 
another attribute, does really assert thereby no other 
thing than this, that one phenomenon always accom- 
panies another phenomenon ; insomuch that where we 
find the one, we have assurance of the existence of the 
other. Thus, in the proposition, All men are mortal, 
the word man connotes the attributes which we 
ascribe to a certain kind of living creatures, on the 
ground of certain phenomena which they exhibit, and 
which are partly physical phenomena, namely the 
impressions made on our senses by their bodily form 
and structure, and partly mental phenomena, namely 
the sentient and intellectual life which they have of 
their own. All this is understood when we utter the 
word man, by any one to whom the meaning of the 
word is known. Now, when we say, Man is mortal, 
we mean that wherever these various physical and men- 
tal phenomena are all found, there we have assurance 
that the other physical and mental phenomenon, called 
death, will not fail to take place. The proposition 
does not affirm when; for the connotation of the word 
mortal goes no farther than to the occurrence of the 
phenomenon at some time or other, leaving the pre- 
cise time undecided.

§ 5. We have already proceeded far enough not 
only to demonstrate the error of Hobbes, but to 
ascertain the real import of by far the most numerous 
class of propositions. The object of belief in a propo- 
sition^ when it asserts anything more than the meaning 
of words, is generally, as in the cases which we have 
examined, either the coexistence or the sequence of 
two phenomena. At the very commencement of our 
inquiry, we found that every act of beUef impUed two 
Things ; we have now ascertained what, in the most 
frequent case, these two things are, namely two 
Phenomena, in other words, two states of conscious- 
ness ; and what it is which the proposition affirms (or 
denies) to subsist between them, namely either suc- 
cession, or coexistence. And this case includes innu- 
merable instances which no one, previous to reflec- 
tion, would think of referring to it. Take the following 
example: A generous person is worthy of honour. 
Who would expect to recognize here a case of coex- 
istence between phenomena? But so it is. The 
attribute which causes a person to be termed generous, 
is ascribed to him on the ground of states of his mind, 
and particulars of his conduct : both are phenomena ; 
the former are facts of internal consciousness, the 
latter, so far as distinct from the former, are physical 
facts, or perceptions of the senses. Worthy of honour, 
admits of a similar analysis. Honour, as here used, 
means a state of approving and admiring emotion, 
followed upon occasion by corresponding outward 
acts. *' Worthy of honour" connotes all this, together 
with our approval of the act of showing honour. All 
these are phenomena; states of internal consciousness, 
accompanied or followed by physical facts. When 
we say, A generous person is worthy of honour, we 
affirm coexistence between the two complicated phe-

134 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

nomeDa connoted by the two terms respectively. We 
affirm, that wherever and whenever the inward feelings 
and outward facts implied in the word generosity, have 
place, then and there the existence and manifestation 
of an inward feeling, honour, would be followed in our 
minds by another inward feeling, approval. 

After the analysis in a former chapter of the import 
of names, many examples are not needed to illustrate 
the import of propositions. When there is any obscu- 
rity or difficulty, it does not lie in the meaning of the 
proposition, but in the meaning of the names which 
compose it ; in the complicated nature of the conno- 
tation of many words; the immense multitude and 
prolonged series of facts which often constitute the 
phenomenon connoted by a name. But where it is 
seen what the phenomenon is, there is seldom any 
difficulty in seeing that the assertion conveyed by the 
proposition is, the coexistence of one such phenomenon 
with another ; or the succession of one such pheno- 
menon to another : their conjunction^ in short, so that 
where the one is found, we may calculate on finding 
both. 

This, however, though the most common, is not 
the only meaning which propositions are ever intended 
to convey. In the first place, sequences and coex- 
istences are not only asserted respecting Phenomena; 
we make propositions also respecting those hidden 
causes of phenomena which are named substances 
and attributes. A substance, however, being to us 
nothing but either that which causes, or that which 
is conscious of, phenomena; and the same being true, 
mutatis mutandisy of attributes ; no assertion can be 
made, at least with a meaning, concerning these un- 
known and unknowable entities, (beyond their mere 
existence,) except in virtue of the Phenomena by

which alone they manifest themselves to our faculties. 
When we say, Socrates was contemporary with the 
Peloponnesian war, the foundation of this assertion, 
as of all assertions concerning substances^ is an 
assertion concerning the phenomena which they 
exhibit,— namely, that the series of facts by which 
Socrates manifested himself to mankind, and the 
series of mental states which constituted his earthly 
existence, went on simultaneously with the series of 
facts known by the name of the Peloponnesian war. 
Still, the proposition does not assert that alone ; it 
asserts that the Thing in itself, the noumenon Socrates, 
was existing, and doing or experiencing those various 
facts, during the same time. Coexistence and se- 
quence, therefore, may be affirmed or denied not only 
between phenomena, but between noumena, or between 
a noumenon and phenomena. And there is one kind of 
assertion which maybe made respecting noumena, inde- 
pendently of the phenomena which are their sensible 
manifestation ; the assertion of their simple existence. 
But what is a noumenon? an unknown cause. In 
affirming, therefore, the existence of a noumenon, we 
affirm causation. Here, therefore, are two additional 
kinds of fact, capable of being asserted in a proposi- 
tion. Besides the propositions which assert Sequence 
or Coexistence, there are some which assert simple 
Existence; and others assert Causation, which, subject 
to the explanations which will follow in the Third 
Book, must be considered provisionally as a distinct 
and pecutiar kind of assertion. 

$ 6. To these four kinds of matter-of-fact or 
assertion, must be added a fifth, Resemblance. This 
was a species of attribute which we found it iim)ossible 
to analyze ; for which no fundamentum, distinct from 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



136 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

the objects themselves, could be assigned. In addi- 
tion to propositions which assert a sequence or coex- 
istence between two phenomena, there are therefore, 
also, propositions which assert resemblance between 
them : as, This colour is like that colour ; — ^The heat 
of to-day is equal to the heat of yesterday. It is true 
that such an assertion might with some plausibility be 
brought within the description of an affirmation of 
sequence, by considering it as an assertion that the 
simultaneous contemplation of the two colours is 
followed by a specific feeling termed the feeling of 
resemblance. But there would be nothing gained by . 
encumbering ourselves, especially in this place, with 
a generalization which may be looked upon as strained. 
Logic does not undertake to analyze things into their 
ultimate elements. Resemblance between two pheno- 
mena is more intelligible in itself than any explanation 
could make it, and under any classification must 
remain specifically distinct from the ordinary cases of 
sequence and coexistence. 

It is sometimes said that all propositions what- 
ever, of which the predicate is a general name» do, in 
point of fact, affirm or deny resemblance. All such 
propositions affirm that a thing belongs to a class ; 
but things being classed together according to their 
resemblance, everything is of course classed with the 
things which it resembles most ; and thence, it may 
be said, when we affirm that gold is a metal, or that 
Socrates is a man, the affirmation intended is, that 
gold resembles other metals, and Socrates other men, 
more nearly than they resemble the objects contained 
in any other of the classes co-ordinate with these. 

There is some slight degree of foundation for 
this re^park, but no more than a slight degree. The 
arrangement of things into classes, such as the class

IMPORT OF PROPOSITIONS. 137 

metaly or the class man^ is grounded indeed upon a 
resemblance among the things which are placed in 
the same class, but not upon a mere general resem- 
blance : the resemblance it is grounded upon consists 
in the possession by all those things, of certain common 
peculiarities ; and those peculiarities it is which the 
terms connote, and which the propositions conse- 
quently assert; not the resemblance: for though 
when I say. Gold is a metal, I say by implication 
that if there be any other metals it must resemble 
them, yet if there were no other metals I might still 
assert the proposition with the same meaning as at pre- 
sent, namely, that gold has the various properties im- 
plied in the word metal ; just as it might be said, Chris- 
tians are men, even if there were no men who were 
not Christians ; or as the expression, Jehovah is God, 
might be used by the firmest believer in the unity of 
the godhead. Propositions, therefore, in which ob- 
jects are referred to a class because they possess the 
attributes constituting the class, are so far from 
asserting nothing but resemblance, that they do not, 
properly speaking, assert resemblance at all. 

But we remarked some time ago (and the reasons 
of the remark will be more fully entered into in a 
subsequent Book), that there is sometimes a conve- 
nience in extending the boundaries of a class so as to 
include things which possess in a very inferior degree, 
if in any, the characteristic properties of the class, — 
provided they resemble that class more than any 
other, insomuch that the general propositions which 
are true of the class will be nearer to being true of 
those things than any other equally general proposi- 
tions. As, for instance, there are substances called 
metals which have very few of the properties by which 
metals are commonly recognised ; and almost every

great family of plants or animals has a few anomalous 
genera or species on its borders, which are admitted 
into it by a sort of courtesy, and concerning which it 
has been matter of discussion to what family they 
properly belonged. Now when the class-name is pre- 
dicated of any object of this description, we do, by so 
predicating it, affirm resemblance and nothing more. 
And in order to be scrupulously correct it ought to 
be said, that in every case in which we predicate a 
general name, we affirm, not absolutely that the object 
possesses the properties designated by the name, but 
that it either possesses those properties, or if it does 
not, at any rate resembles the things which do so, 
more than it resembles any other things. In most 
cases, however, it is unnecessary to suppose any such 
alternative, the latter of the two grounds being very 
seldom that on which the assertion is made: and 
when it is, there is generally some slight difference in 
the form of the expression, as, This species (or genus) 
is considered, or may be ranked^ as belonging to such 
and such a family : we should hardly say positively 
that it does belong to it, unless it possessed unequivo- 
cally the properties of which the class-name is scien- 
tifically significant. 

There is still another exceptional case in which, 
although the predicate is a name of a class, yet in 
predicating it we affirm nothing but resemblance, 
the class being founded not upon resemblance in any 
particular respect^ but upon general unanalyzable re- 
semblance. The classes in question are those into which 
our simple sensations, or other simple feelings, are 
divided. Sensations of white, for instance, are classed 
together, not because we can take them to pieces, and 
say they are alike in this, and not alike in that, but 
because we feel them to be alike altogether, although

in different degrees. When, therefore, I say. The 
colour I saw yesterday was a white colour, or, The sen- 
sation I feel is one of tightness, in both cases the 
attribute I affirm of the colour or of the other sensa^- 
tion is mere resemblance, — simple likeness to sensa- 
tions which I have had before, and which have had 
those names bestowed upon them. The names of 
feelings, like other concrete general names, are con- 
notative; but they connote a mere resemblance. When 
predicated of any individual feeling, the information 
they convey is that of its liken^s to the other feelings 
which we have been accustomed to call by the same 
name. And thus much may suffice in illustration of 
the kind of Propositions in which the matter-of-fact 
asserted (or denied) is simple Resemblance. 

Existence, Coexistence, Sequence, Causation, ) 
Resemblance : one or other of these is asserted (or 
denied) in every proposition, without exception. This 
five-fold division is an exhaustive classification of 
matters -of-fact; of all things that can be believed or 
tendered for belief; of all questions that can be pro- 
pounded, and all answers that can be returned to 
them. Instead of Coexistence and Sequence, we shall 
sometimes say, for greater particularity, Order in Place, 
and Order in Time : Order in Place being one of the 
modes of coexistence, not necessary to be more parti- 
cularly analyzed here ; while the mere fact of coexist- 
ence, or simultaneousness, may be classed, together 
with Sequence, under the head of Order in Time. 

§ 7. In the foregoing inquiry into the import of 
Propositions, we have thought it necessary to ana- 
lyze directly those alone, in which the terms of the 
proposition (or the predicate at least) are concrete 
terms. But, in doing so, we have indirectly analyzed 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



140 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

those in which the terms are abstract. The distinc- 
tion between an abstract term and its corresponding 
concrete, is no difference in what they are appointed 
to signify; for the real signification of a concrete 
general name is, as we have so often said, its con- 
notation ; and what the concrete term connotes, forms 
the entire meaning of the abstract name. Since there 
is nothing in the import of an abstract name which 
is not in the import of the corresponding concrete, it 
is natural to suppose that neither can tiiere be any- 
thing in the import of a proposition of which the 
terms are abstract, but what there is in some proposi- 
tion which can be framed of concrete terms. 

And this presumption a closer examination will 
confirm. An abstract name is the name of an attri- 
bute, or combination of attributes. The correspond- 
ing concrete is a name given to things, because of, 
and in order to express, their possessing that attribute, 
or that combination of attributes. When, therefore, 
we predicate of anything a concrete name, the attribute 
is what we in reality predicate of it. But it has now 
been shown that in all propositions of which the pre- 
dicate is a concrete name, what is really predicated is 
oneof five things: Existence, Coexistence, Causation, 
Sequence, or Resemblance. An attribute, therefore, 
is necessarily either an existence, a coexistence, a 
causation, a sequence, or a resemblance. When a 
proposition consists of a subject and predicate which 
are abstract terms, it consists of terms which must 
necessarily signify one or other of these things. When 
we predicate of any thing an abstract name, we affirm 
of the thing that it is one or other of these five things; 
that it is a case of Existence, or of Coexistence, or of 
Causation, or of Sequence, or of Resemblance. 

It is impossible to imagine any proposition ex-

IMPORT OF PROPOSITIONS. 141 

pressed in abstract terms, which cannot be trans- 
formed into a precisely equivalent proposition in which 
the terms are concrete, namely, either the concrete 
names which connote the attributes themselves, or 
the names of the fundamenta of those attributes, the 
facts or phenomena on which they are grounded. To 
illustrate the latter case, let us take this proposition, 
of which only the subject is an abstract name, — 
" Thoughtlessness is dangerous." Thoughtlessness 
is an attribute groimded on the facts which we call 
thoughtless actions ; and the proposition is equivalent 
to this. Thoughtless actions are dangerous. In the 
next example the predicate as well as the subject are 
abstract names : *' Whiteness is a colour;*' or " The 
colour of snow is a whiteness." These attributes 
being grounded upon sensations, the equivalent pro- 
positions in the concrete would be. The sensation of 
white is one of the sensations called those of colour, — 
The sensation of sight, caused by looking at snow, is 
one of the sensations caUed sensations of white. In 
these propositions, as we have before seen, the matter- 
of-fact asserted is a Resemblance. In the following 
examples, the concrete terms are those which directly 
correspond to the abstract names ; connoting the at- 
tribute which these denote. *' Prudence is a virtue :" 
this may be rendered, *' All prudent persons, in so 
far as prudent, are virtuous :'* ** Courage is deserving 
of honour '' thus, ** All courageous persons are de- 
serving of honour so far forth as they are courageous ;" 
which is equivalent to this — **A11 courageous persons 
deserve an addition to the honour, or a diminution 
of the disgrace, which would attach to them on other 
grounds." 

In order to throw still further Ught upon the 
import of propositions of which the terms are abstract. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



142 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

we will subject one of the examples given above to a 
minuter analysis. Tlie proposition we shall select is 
the following :— " Prudence is a virtue." Let us sub- 
stitute for the word virtue an equivalent but more defi- 
nite expression, such as ''a mental quality beneficial to 
society," or ** a mental quality pleasing to God," or 
whichever other of the definitions of virtue we prefer. 
What the proposition asserts is a sequence, accompa- 
nied with causation, namely, that benefit to society, 
or that the approval of God, is consequent upon, 
and caused by, prudence. Here is a sequence ; but 
between what? We understand the consequent of 
the sequence, but we have yet to analyze the ante- 
cedent. Prudence is an attribute ; and, in connexion 
with it, two things besides itself are to be considered ; 
prudent persons, who are the subjects of the attribute, 
and prudential conduct, which may be called the foun- 
dation of it. Now is either of these the antecedent ? 
and, first, is it meant, that the approval of God, or 
benefit to society, is attendant upon all prudent persons? 
No ; except in so far forth as they are prudent ; for 
prudent persons who are scoundrels can seldom on the 
whole be beneficial to society, nor acceptable to even 
finite wisdom. Is it upon prudential conduct y then, 
that divine approbation and benefit to mankind are 
invariably consequent ? Neither is this the assertion 
meant when it is said that prudence is a virtue; 
except with the same reservation as before, and for 
the same reason, namely, that prudential conduct, 
although in so far as it is prudential it is beneficial 
to society, may yet, by reason of some other of its 
qualities, be productive of an injury outweighing the 
benefit, and of a divine displeasure exceeding the 
approbation which would be due to the prudence. 
Neither the substance, therefore (viz., the person). 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC i 



IMPORT OF PROPOSITIONS. 143 

nor the phenomenon (the cx>nduct), is an antece- 
dent upon which the other term of the sequence is 
universally consequent. But the proposition, *' Pru- 
dence is a virtue/' is an universal proposition. What 
is it, then, upon which the proposition affirms the 
effects in question to he universally consequent? 
Upon that in the person, and in the conduct, which 
causes them to be called prudent, and which is equally 
in them when the action, though prudent, is wicked ; 
namely, a correct foresight of consequences, a just esti- 
mation of their importance to the object in view, and 
repression of any unreflecting impulse at variance with 
the deliberate purpose. These, which are states of the 
person's mind, are the real antecedent in the sequence, 
the real cause in the causation, which are asserted by 
the proposition. But these are also the real ground, 
or foundation^ of the attribute Prudence; since where- 
ever these states of mind exist we may predicate 
prudence, even before we know whether any conduct 
has followed. And in this manner every assertion re- 
specting an attribute may be transformed into an 
assertion exactly equivalent respecting the fact or 
phenomenon which is the ground of the attribute. 
And no case can be assigned, where that which is 
predicated of the fact or phenomenon, does not belong 
to one or other of the five species formerly enume- 
rated : it is either simple Existence, or it is some 
Sequence, Coexistence, Causation, or Resemblance. 

And as these five are the only things which can 
be affirmed, so are they the only things which can be 
denied. "No horses are web-footed" denies that 
the attributes of a horse ever coexist with web-feet. 
It is scarcely necessary to apply the same analysis to 
Particular affirmations and negations. " Some birds 
are web-footed," affirms that, with the attributes

144 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

connoted by bird^ the phenomenon web-feet is some- 
times coexistent : " Some birds are not web-footed," 
asserts that there are other instances in which this 
coexistence does not have place. Any farther expla- 
nation of a thing which, if the previous exposition 
has been assent^ to, is so obvious, may well be 
spared.

Chapter VI. 

OF PROPOSITIONS MERELY VERBAL. 

§ 1. As a preparation for the inquiry which is 
the proper object of Logic, namely, in what manner 
propositions are to be proved, we have found it neces- 
sary to inquire what they contain which requires, or is 
susceptible of, proof; or (which is the same thing) 
what they assert. In the course of this preliminary 
investigation into the import of Propositions, we 
examined the opinion of the Conceptualists, that a 
proposition is the expression of a relation between 
two ideas; and the doctrine of the Nominalists, that it 
is the expression of an agreement or disagreement 
between the meanings of two names. We decided 
that, as general theories, both of these are erroneous ; 
and that, although propositions may be made both 
respecting names and respecting ideas, neither the 
one nor the other are the subject-matter of Proposi- 
tions considered generally. We then examined the 
different kinds of propositions, and we found that, 
with the exception of those which are merely verbal, 
they assert five different kinds of matters of fact, 
namely. Existence, Order in Place, Order in Time, 
Causation, and Resemblance ; that in every propo- 
sition one of these five is either aflSrmed, or denied, of 
some fact or phenomenon, or of some object the 
unknown source of a fact or phenomenon. 

In distinguishing, however, the different kinds of 
matters of fact asserted in propositions, we reserved 
one class of propositions, which do not relate to any 
VOL. I. Digitizedtv Google 



146 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

matter of fact, in the proper sense of the term, at all, 
but to the meaning of names. Since names and their 
signification are entirely arbitrary, such propositions 
are not, strictly speaking, susceptible of truth or 
ialsity, but only of conformity or disconformity to 
usage or convention; and all the proof they are 
capable of, is proof of usage ; proof that the words 
have been employed by others in the acceptation in 
which the speaker or writer desires to use them. 
These propositions occupy, however, a conspicuous 
place in philosophy; and their nature and charac- 
teristics are of as much importance in logic, as those 
of any of the other classes of propositions previously 
adverted to. 

If all propositions respecting the signification of 
words, were as simple and imimportant as those which 
served us for examples when examining Hobbes' 
theory of predication, viz., those of which the subject 
and predicate are proper names, and which assert only 
that those names have, or that they have not, been 
conventionally assigned to the same individual ; there 
would be little to attract to such propositions the atten- 
tion of philosophers. But the class of merely verbal 
propositions embraces not only much more than these, 
but much more than any propositions which at first 
sight present themselves as verbal; comprehending 
a kind of assertions which have been regarded not 
only as relating to things, but as having actually a 
more intimate relation with them than any other pro- 
positions whatever. The student in philosophy will 
perceive that I allude to the distinction on which so 
much stress was laid by the schoolmen, and which has 
been retained either under the same or under other 
names by most metaphysicians to the present day, 
viz., between what were called essential, and what

VERBAL AND REAL PROPOSITIONS. 147 

were called accidental y propositions, and between 
essential and accidental properties or attributes. 

$ 2. Almost all metaphysicians prior to Locke, 
as well as many since his time, have made a great 
mystery of Essential Predication, and of predicates 
which were said to be of the essence of the subject. 
The essence of a thing, they said, was that without 
which the thing could neither be, nor be conceived to 
be. Thus, rationaUty was of the essence of man, 
because without rationality, man could not be con- 
ceived to exist. The diflferent attributes which made 
up the essence of the thing, were called its essential 
properties ; and a proposition in which any of these 
were predicated of it, was called an Essential Propo- 
sition, and was considered to go deeper into the 
nature of the thing, and to convey more important 
information respecting it, than any other proposition 
could do. All properties, not of the essence of the 
thing, were called its accidents; were supposed to 
have nothing at all, or nothing comparatively, to do 
with its inmost nature ; and the propositions in which 
any of these were predicated of it were called Acci- 
dental Propositions. A connexion may be traced 
between this distinction, which originated with the 
schoolmen, and the well known dogmas of substantus 
secunddSy or general substances, and substantial forms, 
doctrines which under varieties of language pervaded 
alike the Aristotelian and the Platonic schools, and of 
which more of the spirit has come down to modern 
times than might be conjectured from the disuse of 
the phraseology. The false views of the nature of 
classification and generalization which prevailed 
among the schoolmen, and of which these dogmas 
were the technical expression, afford the only expla-

nation which can be given of their having misunder- 
stood the real nature of those Essences which held so 
conspicuous a place in their philosophy. They said, 
truly, that man cannot be conceived without rationaUty . 
But though man cannot, a being may be conceived 
exactly like a man in all points except that one 
quality, and those others which are the conditions or 
consequences of it. All therefore which is really true 
in the assertion that man cannot be conceived with- 
out rationality, is only, that if he had not rationality, 
he would not be reputed a man. There is no impos- 
sibility in conceiving the thing, nor, for aught we 
know, in its existing : the impossibiUty is in the con- 
ventions of language, which will not allow the thing, 
even if it exist, to be called by the name which is 
reserved for rational beings. Rationality, in short, is 
involved in the meaning of the word man ; it is one 
of the attributes connoted by the name. The essence 
of man, simply means the whole of the attributes 
connoted by the word; and any one of those attributes 
taken singly, is an essential property of man. 

The doctrines which prevented the real meaning 
of Essences from being understood, not having 
assumed so settled a shape in the time of Aristotle 
and his immediate followers as was afterwards given 
to them by the Realists of the middle ages, we find a 
nearer approach to true views of the subject in the 
writings of the ancient Aristotelians than in their 
more modem followers. Porphyry, in his hagoge, 
approached so near to the true conception of essence^, 
that only one step remained to be taken, but this 
step, so easy in appearance, was reserved for the 
Nominalists of modern times. By altering any pro-

made it aXKoiov : but by altering any property which 
was of its essence, you made it another things aXko*. 
To a modem it is obvious that between the change 
which only makes a thing different, and the change 
which makes it another thing ^ the only distinction is 
that in the one case, though changed, it is still called 
by the same name. Thus, pound ice in a mortar, 
and being still called ice, it is only made aXXolov: 
melt it, and it becomes SXXo, another thing, namely, 
water. Now it is really the same thing, i. e., the same 
particles of matter, in both cases; and you cannot so 
change anything that it shall cease to be the same 
thing in this sense. The identity which it can be 
deprived of is merely that of the name: when the 
thing ceases to be called ice, it becomes another thing ^ 
its essence, what constitutes it ice, is gone; while, so 
long as it continues to be so called, nothing is gone 
except some of its accidents. But these reflections, 
so easy to us, would have been difficult to persons 
who thought, as most of the Aristotelians did, that 
objects were made what they were called, that ice (for 
instance) was made ice, not by the possession of 
certain properties to which mankind have chosen to 
attach that name, but by participation in the nature 
of a certain general substance, called Ice in general^ 
which substance, together with all the properties that 
belonged to it, inhered in every individual piece of ice. 
As they did not consider these universal substances to 
be attached to all general names but only to some, 
they thought that an object borrowed only a part of

its properties from an universal substance, and that 
the rest belonged to it individually : the former they 
called its essence, and the latter its accidents. The 
scholastic doctrine of essences long survived the 
theory on which it rested, that of the existence of real 
entities corresponding to general terms ; and it was 
reserved for Locke, at the end of the seventeenth 
century, to convince philosophers that the supposed 
essences of classes were merely the signification of 
their names; nor, among the signal services which that 
great man rendered to philosophy, was there one more 
needful or more valuable*. 

Now, as the most familiar of the general names 
predicable of an object usually connotes not one only, 



* Few among the great names in philosophy have met with a 
harder measure of justice from the present generation than Locke; 
the unquestioned founder of the analytic philosophy of mind, but 
whose doctrines were first caricatured, then, when the reaction 
arrived, oast o£r by the prevailing school even with contumely, and 
who is now regarded by one of the conflicting parties in philosophy 
as an apostle of heresy and sophistry, while among those who still 
adhere to the standard which he raised, there has been a disposition 
in later times to sacrifice his reputation in favour of Hobbes ; a 
great writer, and a great thinker for his time, but inferior to Locke 
not only in sober judgment but even in profundity and original 
genius. Locke, the most candid of philosophers, and one whose 
speculations bear on every subject the strongest marks of having 
been wrought out from the materials of his own mind, has been 
mistaken for an unworthy plagiarist, while Hobbes has been extolled 
as having anticipated many of his leading doctrines. He did anti- 
cipate many of them, and the present is an instance in what manner 
it was generally done. They both rejected the scholastic doctrine 
of essences; but Locke understood and explained what these sup- 
posed essences really were; Hobbes, instead of explaining the dis- 
tinction between essential and accidental properties, and between 
essential and accidental propositions, jumped over it, and gave a 
definition which suits at most only essential propositions, and 
scarcely those, as the definition of Proposition in general.

but several attributes of the object, each of which 
attributes separately forms also the bond of union 
of some class, and the meaning of some general 
name ; we may predicate of a name which connotes a 
variety of attributes, another name which connotes 
only one of these attributes, or some smaller number 
of them than all. In such cases, the universal 
affirmative proposition will be true; since whatever 
possesses the whole of any set of attributes, must 
possess any part of that same set. A proposition of 
this sort, however, conveys no information to any one 
who previously understood the whole meaning of the 
terms. The propositions. Every man is a corporeal 
being, Every man is a living creature, Every man is 
rational, convey no knowledge to any one who was 
already aware of the entire meaning of the word mariy 
for the meaning of the word includes all this: and, 
that every man has the attributes connoted by all these 
predicates, is already asserted when he is called a 
man. Now, of this nature are all the propositions 
which have been called essential ; they are, in fact, 
identical propositions. 

It is true that a proposition which predicates any 
attribute, even though it be one implied in the name, 
is in most cases understood to involve a tacit assertion 
that there eonsts a thing corresponding to the name, 
and possessing the attributes connoted by it; and this 
implied assertion may convey information, even to 
those who understood the meaning of the name. But 
all information of this sort, conveyed by all the 
essential propositions of which man can be made the 
subject, is included in the assertion. Men exist. And 
this assumption of real existence is after all only the 
result of an imperfection of language. It arises from 
the ambiguity of the copula, which, in addition to 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



152 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

its proper office of a mark to show that an assertion is 
made, is also, as we have formerly remarked, a con- 
crete word connoting existence. The actual existence 
of the subject of the proposition is therefore only 
apparently^ not really, implied in the predication, if 
an essential one: we may say, A ghost is a disembodied 
spirit, without believing in ghosts. But an acci- 
dental, or non-essential, affirmation, does imply the 
real existence of the subject, because in the case of a 
non-existent subject there is nothing for the propo- 
sition to assert. Such a proposition as, The ghost of 
a murdered person haunts the couch of the murderer, 
can only have a meaning if understood as implying 
a belief in ghosts ; for since the signification of the 
word ghost implies nothing of the kind, the speaker 
either means nothing, or means to assert a thing 
which he wishes to be believed really to have taken 
place. 

It will be hereafter seen that when any important 
consequences seem to follow, as in mathematics, from 
an essential proposition, or, in other words, from a 
proposition involved in the meaning of a name, what 
they really flow from is the tacit assumption of the 
real existence of the object so named. Apart from 
this assumption of real existence, the class of propo- 
sitions in which the predicate is of the essence of the 
subject (that is, in which the predicate connotes the 
whole or part of what the subject connotes, but 
nothing besides,) answer no purpose but that of 
unfolding the whole or some part of the meaning of 
the name, to those who did not previously know it. 
Accordingly, the most useful, and in strictness the 
only useful, kind of essential propositions, are Defi- 
nitions: which, to be complete, should unfold the 
whole of what is involved in the meaning of the word

VERBAL AND REAL PROPOSITIONS. 153 

defined; that is, (when it is a connotalive word,) the 
whole of what it connotes. In defining a name, how- 
ever, it is not usual to specify its entire connotation, 
but so much only as is suflScient to mark out the 
objects usually denoted by it from all other known 
objects. And sometimes a merely accidental property, 
not involved in the meaning of the name, answers 
this purpose equally well. The various kinds of defi- 
nition which these distinctions give rise to, and the 
piu^poses to which they are respectively subservient, 
will be minutely considered in the proper place. 

§ 3. According to the above view of essential pro- 
positions, no proposition can be reckoned such which 
relates to an individual by name, that is, in which the 
subject is a proper name. Individuals have no es- 
sences. When the schoolmen talked of the essence 
of an individual, they did not mean the properties im- 
plied in its name, for the names of individuals imply 
no properties. They regarded as of the essence of an 
individual whatever was of the essence of the species 
in which they were accustomed to place that indivi- 
dual; I. e.f of the class to which it was most familiarly 
referred, and to which, therefore, they conceived that 
it by nature belonged. Thus, because the propo- 
sition, Man is a rational being, was an essential pro- 
position, they aflSrmed the same thing of the propo- 
sition, Julius Csesar is a rational being. This fol- 
lowed very naturally if genera and species were to be 
considered as entities, distinct from, but inhering in, 
the individuals composing them. If man was a sub- 
stance inhering in each individual man, the essence of 
man (whatever that might mean,) was naturally sup. 
posed to accompany it; to inhere in John Thompson, 
and form the common essence of Thompson and Julius

C8esar. It might then be fairly said, that rationality, 
being of the essence of Man, was of the essence also 
of Thompson. But if Man altogether be only the 
individual men and a name bestowed upon them in 
consequence of certain common properties, what 
becomes of John Thompson's essence? 

A fundamental error is seldom expelled from phi- 
losophy by a single victory. It retreats slowly, 
defends every inch of groimd, and often retains a 
footing in some remote fastness after it has been 
driven from the open country. The essences of indi- 
viduals were an unmeaning figment arising from a 
misapprehension of the essences of classes, yet even 
Locke, when he extirpated the parent error, could not 
shake himself free from that which was its fruit. He 
distinguished two sorts of essences, Real and Nominal. 
His nominal essences were the essences of classes, 
explained nearly as we have now explained them. 
Nor is anything wanting to render the third book of 
Locke's Essay a nearly perfect treatise on the con- 
notation of names, except to free its language from 
the assumption of what are called Abstract Ideas, 
which unfortunately is involved in the phraseology, 
although not necessarily connected with the thoughts, 
contained in that immortal Third Book*. But, 



* The always acute and often profound author of An Outline of 
Sematolgy (Mr. B. H. Smart) justly says, *' Locke will be much 
more intelligible if, in the majority of places, wo substitute * the 
knowledge of* for what he calls, ' the idea of " (p. 10), Among the 
many criticit^ms upon Locke's use of the word Idea, this is the only 
one which, as it appears to me, precisely hits the mark; and I quote 
it for the additional reason that it precisely expresses the point of 
diflFerence respecting the import of Propositions, between my view 
and what I have called the Conceptualist view of them. "Where a 
Conccptualist says that a name or a proposition expresses our Idea of 
a thing, I should generally say (instead of our Idea) our Knowledge, 
or Belief, concerning the thing itself. ^.^^^^^^^ ^^ GoOglc

besides nominal essences, he admitted real essences, 
or essences of individual objects, which he supposed to 
be the causes of the sensible properties of those 
objects. We know not, (said he,) what these are ; 
(and this acknowledgment rendered the fiction com- 
paratively innocuous;) but if we did, we could, from 
them alone, demonstrate the sensible properties of 
the object, as the properties of the triangle are demon- 
strated from the definition of the triangle, I shall 
have occasion to revert to this theory in treating of 
Demonstration, and of the conditions under which one 
property of a thing admits of being demonstrated from 
another property. It is enough here to remark that 
according to this definition, the real essence of an 
object has, in the progress of physics, come to be 
conceived as nearly equivalent, in the case of bodies, 
to their corpuscular structure: what it is now sup- 
posed to mean in the case of any other entities, I 
would not take upon myself to define. 

§ 4. An essential proposition, then^ is one which 
is purely verbal ; which asserts of a thing under a 
particular name, only what is asserted of it in the 
fact of calling it by that name ; and which therefore 
either gives no information, or gives it respecting the 
name, not the thing. Non-essential, or accidental 
propositions, on the contrary, may be called Real Pro- 
positions, in opposition to Verbal. They predicate of 
a thing, some fact not involved in the signification of 
the name by which the proposition speaks of it ; some 
attribute not connoted by that name. Such are all 
propositions concerning things individually designated, 
and all general or particular propositions in which the 
predicate connotes any attribute not connoted by the 
subject. All these, if true, add to our knowledge :

156 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

they convey information, not already involved in the 
names employed. When I am told that all, or even 
that some objects, which have certain qualities, or 
which stand in certain relations, have also certain other 
qualities, or stand in certain other relations, I learn 
from this proposition a new fact ; a fact not included 
in my knowledge of the meaning of the words, nor 
even of the existence of Things answering to the signi- 
fication of those words. It is this class of propositions 
only whicli are in themselves instructive, or from 
which any instructive propositions can be inferred. 

Nothing has probably contributed more to the 
opinion so commonly prevalent of the futility of the 
school logic, than the circumstance that almost all 
the examples used in the common school books to 
illustrate the doctrines of predication and of the syllo- 
gism, consist of essential propositions. They were 
usually taken either from the branches or from the 
main trunk of the Predicamental Tree, which included 
nothing but what was of the essence of the species : 
Omne corpus est substantia^ Omne animal est corpus^ 
Omnis homo est corpus^ Omnis homo est animal^ Omnis 
homo est rationalis, and so forth. It is far from won- 
derful that the syllogistic art should have been thought 
to be of no use in assisting correct reasoning, when 
almost the only propositions which, in the hands of 
its professed teachers, it was employed to prove, were 
such as every one assented to without proof the 
moment he comprehended the meaning of the words ; 
and stood exactly on a level, in point of evidence, 
with the premisses from which they were drawn. I 
have, therefore, throughout this work, studiously 
avoided the employment of essential propositions as 
examples, except where the nature of the principle to 
be illustrated specifically required them.

§ 5. With respect to propositions which do con- 
vey information, which assert something of a Thing, 
imder a name that does not already presuppose what 
is about to be asserted, there are two diflFerent aspects 
in which these, or rather such of them as are general 
propositions, may be considered : we may either look 
at them as portions of speculative truth, or as memo- 
randa for practical use. According as we consider 
propositions in one or the other of these Ughts, their 
import may be conveniently expressed in one or in 
the other of two formulas. 

According to the formula which we have hitherto 
employed, and which is best adapted to express the 
import of the proposition as a portion of our theo- 
retical knowledge, All men are mortal, means that 
the attributes of man are always accompanied by the 
attribute mortality : No men are gods, means that the 
attributes of man are never accompanied by the attri- 
butes, or at least never by all the attributes, of a god. 
But when the proposition is considered as a memo- 
randum for practical use, we shall find a different 
mode of expressing the same meaning better adapted 
to indicate the oflScc which the proposition performs. 
The practical use of a proposition is to apprise or 
remind us what we have to expect in any individual 
case which comes within the assertion contained in 
the proposition. In relerence to this purpose, the 
proposition, All men are mortal, means that the attri- 
butes of man are evidence of^ are a mark of, mortality; 
an indication by which the presence of that attribute 
is made manifest. No men are gods, means that the 
attributes of man are a mark or evidence that some or 
all of the attributes of a god are not there; that where 
the former are, we need not expect to find the latter. 

These two forms of expression are at bottom equi-

158 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

valent; but the one points the attention more directly 
to what a proposition means, the latter to the manner 
in which it is to be used. 

Now it is to be observed that Reasoning (the subject 
to which we are next to proceed) is a process into 
which propositions enter not as ultimate results, but 
as means to the establishment of other propositions. 
We may expect, therefore, that the mode of exhibiting 
the import of a general propositition which shows it 
in its application to practical use, will best express 
the function which propositions perform in Reasoning. 
And accordingly, in the theory of Reasoning, the mode 
of viewing the subject which considers a Proposition 
as asserting that one fact or phenomenon is a mark or 
evidence of another fact or phenomenon, will be found 
almost indispensable. For the purposes of that Theory, 
the best mode of defining the import of a proposition 
is not the mode which shows the most clearly what it 
is in itself, but that which most distinctly suggests 
the manner in which it may be made available for 
advancing from it to other propositions.

Chapter VII. 

OF THE NATURE OF CLASSIFICATION, AND THE 
FIVE PREDICABLES. 

§ 1. In examining into the nature of general pro- 
positions, we have adverted much less than is usual 
with Logicians, to the ideas of a Class, and Classi- 
fication ; ideas which, since the Realist doctrine of 
Greneral Substances went out of vogue, have formed 
the basis of almost every attempt at a philosophical 
theory of general terms and general propositions. 
We have considered general names as having a mean- 
ing, quite independently of their being the names of 
classes. That circumstance is in truth accidental, it 
being wholly inmxaterial to the signification of the 
name whether there are many objects or only one to 
which it happens to be applicable, or whether there 
be any at all. Grod is as much a general term to 
the Christian or the Jew as to the Poljrtheist ; and 
dragon, hippogriff, chimera, mermaid, ghost, are 
as much so as if real objects existed, corresponding 
to those names. Every name the signification of 
which is constituted by attributes, is potentially a 
name of an indefinite number of objects ; but it needs 
not be actually the name of any ; and if of any, it 
may be the name of only one. As soon as we employ 
a name to connote attributes, the things, be they more 
or fewer, which happen to possess those attributes, 
are constituted, ipso facto ^ a class. But in predicating 
the name we predicate only the attributes ; and the 
fact of belonging to a class does not, in ordinary cases, 
come into view at all.

160 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

Although, however, Predication does not pre- 
suppose Classification, and although the theory of 
Names and of Propositions is not cleared up, but only 
encumbered, by intruding the idea of classification into 
it, there is nevertheless a close connexion between 
Classification, and the employment of General Names. 
By every general name which we introduce, we create 
a class, if there be any existing things to compose it ; 
that is, any Things corresponding to the signification 
of the name. Classes, therefore, mostly owe their 
existence to general language. But general language, 
also, though that is not the most common case, some- 
times owes its existence to classes. A general, which 
is as much as to say a significant, name, is indeed 
mostly mtroduced because we have a signification to 
express by it ; because we need a word by means of 
which to predicate the attributes which it connotes. 
But it is also true that a name is sometimes introduced 
because we have found it convenient to create a class; 
because we have thought it useful for the regulation 
of our mental operations, that a certain group of 
objects should be thought of together. A naturalist, 
for purposes connected with his particular science, 
sees reason to distribute the animal or vegetable crea- 
tion into certain groups rather than into any others, 
and he requires a name to bind, as it were, each of 
his groups together. It must not however be sup- 
posed that such names, when introduced, diflfer in any 
respect, as to their mode of signification, from other 
connotative names. The classes which they denote 
are, as much as any other classes, constituted by 
certain common attributes ; and their names are signi- 
ficant of those attributes, and of nothing else. The 
names of Cuvier's classes and orders, Plantigrades, 
Digitigradest &c., are as much the expression of attri-

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLES. 161 

butes as if those names had preceded, instead of 
growing out of, his Classification of Animals. The 
only peculiarity of the case is, that the convenience of 
classification was here the primary motive for intro- 
ducing the names ; while in other cases the name is 
introduced as a means of predication, and the forma- 
tion of a class denoted by it is only an indirect con- 
sequence. 

The principles which ought to regulate Classifica- 
tion as a logical process subservient to the investi- 
gation of truth, cannot be discussed to any purpose 
until a much later stage of our inquiry. But, of 
classification as resulting from, and implied in, the 
fact of employing general language, we cannot forbear 
to treat here, without leaving the theory of general 
names, and of their employment in predication, 
mutilated and formless. 

§ 2. Thi» portion of the theory of general language 
is the subject of what is termed the doctrine of the 
Predicables ; — a set of distiilctions handed down from 
Aristotle and his follower, Porphyry, many of which 
have taken a firm root in scientific, and some of them 
even in popular, phraseology. The Predicables are 
a five-fold division of General Names, not grounded 
as usual upon a difference in their meaning, that is, 
in the attribute which they connote, but upon a 
difference in the kind of class which they (denote. We 
may predicate of a thing five different varieties of 
class-name : —

162 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

It is to be remarked of these distinctions, that they 
express, not what the predicate is in its own meaning, 
but what relation it bears to the subject of which it 
happens on the particular occasion to be predicated. 
There are not some names which are exclusively 
genera, and others which are exclusively species, or 
diflferentise; but the same name is referred to one or 
another Predicable, according to the subject of which it 
is predicated on the particular occasion. Animal, for 
instance, is a genus with respect to Man, or John; a 
species with respect to Substance, or Being. Rec- 
tangular is one of the Diflferentiae of a geometrical 
square: it is merely one of the Accidentia of the 
table on which I am writing. The words genus, 
species, &c., are therefore relative terms; they are 
names applied to certain predicates, to express the 
relation between them and some given subject: a 
relation grounded, as we shall see, not upon what the 
predicate connotes, but upon the class which it de- 
notes, and upon the place which, in some given clas- 
sification, that class occupies relatively to the particular 
subject. 

§ 3. Of these five names, two. Genus and Species, 
are not only used by naturalists in a technical accep- 
tation not precisely agreeing with their philosophical 
meaning, but have also acquired a popular acceptation, 
much more general than either. In this popular 
sense any two classes, one of which includes the 
whole of the other and more, may be called a Genus 
and a Species. Such, for instance, are Animal and 
Man; Man and Mathematician. Animal is a genus ; 
Man and Brute « its two species ; or we may divide 
it into a greater nimiber of species, as man, horse, 
dog, &c. Biped, or two-footed animal^ may also be

considered a genus, of which raan and bird are two 
species. Taste is a genus, of which sweet taste, sour 
taste, salt taste, &c., are species. Virtue is a genus ; 
justice, prudence, courage, fortitude, generosity, &c., 
are its species. 

The same class which is a genus with reference to 
the sub*classes or species included in it, may be itself 
a species with reference to a more comprehensive, or, 
as it is often called, a superior, genus. Man is a 
species with reference to animal, but a genus with 
reference to the species mathematician. Animal is a 
genus, divided into two species, man and brute ; but 
animal is also a species, which, with another species, 
vegetable, makes up the genus, organized being. 
Biped is a genus with reference to man and bird, but 
a species with respect to the superior genus, animal. 
Taste is a genus divided into species, but also a 
species of the genus sensation. Virtue, a genus with 
reference to justice, temperance, &c., is one of the 
species of the genus, mental quality. 

In this popular sense the words Genus and Species 
have passed into common discourse. And it should 
be observed that, in ordinary parlance, not the name 
of the class, but the class itself, is said to be the genus 
or species ; not, of course, the c;lass in the sense of 
each individual of that class, but the individuals 
collectively, considered as an aggregate whole; the 
names by which the class is designated being then 
called not the genus or species, but the generic or 
specific name. And this is an admissible form of 
expression ; nor is it of any importance which of the 
two modes of speaking we adopt, provided the rest of 
our language is consistent with it ; but if we call the 
class itself the genus, we must not talk of predicating 
the genus. We predicate of man the name mortal ;

and by predicating the name, we may be said, in an 
intelligible sense, to predicate what the name ex- 
presses, the attribute mortality ; but in no allowable 
sense of the word predication do we predicate o( man 
the class mortal. We predicate of him the fact of 
belonging to the class 

By the Aristotelian logicians, the terms genus and 
species were used in a more restricted sense. They 
did not admit every class which could be divided into 
other classes to be a genus, or every class which could 
be included in a larger class to be a species. Animal 
was by them considered a genus ; and man and brute 
co-ordinate species under that genus : biped would not 
have been admitted to be a genus with reference to 
man, but a proprium or accidens only. It was requi- 
site, according to their theory, that genus and species 
should be of the essence of the subject. Animal was 
of the essence of man ; biped was not. And in every 
classification they considered some one class as the 
lowest or infima species; man, for instance, was a 
lowest species. Any further divisions into which the 
class might be capable of being broken down, as man 
into white, black, and red man, or into priest and 
layman, they did not admit to be species. 

It has been seen, however, in the preceding 
chapter, that the distinction between the essence of a 
class, and the attributes or properties which are not of 
its essence, — a distinction which has given occasion to 
so much abstruse speculation, and to which so mys- 
terious a character was formerly, and by many writers 
is still, attached, — amounts to nothing more than the 
difference between those attributes of the class which 
are, and those which are not, involved in the signifi- 
cation of the class-name. As applied to individuals, 
the word Essence, we found, has no meaning, except

in connexion with the exploded tenets of the Realists ; 
and what the schoolmen chose to call the essence of 
an individual, was simply the essence of the class to 
which that individual was most familiarly referred. 

Is there no difference, then, except this merely 
verbal one, between the classes which the schoolmen 
admitted to be genera or species, and those to which 
they refused the title ? Is it an error to regard some 
of the differences which exist among objects as dif- 
ferences in kind {genere or specie), and others only as 
differences in the accidents? Were the schoolmen 
right or wrong in giving to some of the classes into 
which things may be divided, the name of kinds, and 
considering others as secondary divisions, grounded 
upon differences of a comparatively superficial nature? 
Examination will show that the Aristotelians did mean 
something by this distinction, and something im- 
portant ; but which, being but indistinctly conceived, 
was inadequately expressed by the phraseology of 
essences, and by the various other modes of speech to 
which they had recourse. 

$ 4. It is a fundamental principle in logic, that the 
power of framing classes is unlimited, as long as there 
is any (even the smallest) difference to found a dis- 
tinction upon. Take any attribute whatever, and if 
some things have it, and others have not, we may 
ground upon the attribute a division of all things into 
two classes ; and we actually do so, the moment we 
create a name which connotes the attribute. The 
number of possible classes, therefore, is boundless ; 
and there are as many actual classes (either of real or 
of imaginary things) as there are general names, posi- 
tive and negative together. 

But if we contemplate any one of the classes so

formed, such as the class animal or plant, or the 
class sulphur or phosphorus, or the class white or red, 
and consider in what particulars the individuals in- 
cluded in the class diflfer from those which do not 
come within it, we find a very remarkable diversity in 
this respect between some classes and others. There 
are some classes, the things contained in which differ 
from other things only in certain particulars which 
maybe numbered; while others differ in more than 
can be numbered, more even than we need ever expect 
to know. Some classes have little or nothing in com- 
mon to characterise them by, except precisely what is 
connoted by the name : white things, for example, are 
not distinguished by any common properties except 
whiteness ; or if they are, it is only by such as are in 
some way dependent upon, or connected with, white- 
ness. But a hundred generations have not exhausted 
the common properties of animals or of plants, of 
sulphur or of phosphorus ; nor do we suppose them to 
be exhaustible, but proceed to new observations and 
experiments, in the full confidence of discovering new 
properties which were by no means impUed in those 
we previously knew. While, if any one were to 
propose for investigation the common properties of all 
things which are of the same colour, the same shape, 
or the same specific gravity, the absurdity would be 
palpable. We have no ground to believe that any such 
common properties exist, except such as may be 
shown to be involved in the supposition itself, or to 
be derivable from it by some law of causation. It 
appears, therefore, that the properties, on which we 
ground our classes, sometimes exhaust all that the 
class has in common, or contain it all by some mode 
of implication; but in other instances we make a 
selection of a few properties from among not only a

greater number, but a number inexhaustible by us, 
and to which as we know no bounds, they may, so 
far as we are concerned, be regarded as infinite. 

There is no impropriety in saying that of these 
two classifications, the one answers to a much more 
radical distinction in the things themselves, than the 
other does. And if any one even chooses to say that 
the one classification is made by nature, the other by 
us for our convenience, he will be right ; provided he 
means no more than this, — ^that where a certain appa* 
rent difierence between things (although perhaps in 
itself of little moment) answers to we know not what 
number of other diflFerences, pervading not only their 
known properties but properties yet undiscovered, it 
is not optional but imperative to recognise this differ- 
ence as the foundation of a specific distinction : while, 
on the contrary, differences that are merely finite and 
determinate, like those designated by the words white, 
black, or red, may be disregarded if the purpose for 
which the classification is made does not require 
attention to those particular properties. The diflfer- 
ences, however, are made by nature, in both cases ; 
while the recognition of those differences as grounds 
of classification and of naming, is, equally in both 
cases, the act of man : only in the one case, the ends 
of language and of classification would be subverted if 
no notice were taken of the difference, while in the 
other case, the necessity of taking notice of it depends 
upon the importance or unimportance of the parti- 
cular qualities in which the difference happens to 
consist. 

Now, these classes, distinguished by unknown 
multitudes of properties, and not solely by a few 
determinate ones, are the only classes which, by the

Aristotelian logicians, were considered as genera or 
species. Differences which extended to a certain 
property or properties, and there terminated, they 
considered as differences only in the accidents of things; 
but where any class differed from other things by an 
infinite series of differences, known and unknown, 
they considered the distinction as one of Wnd, and 
spoke of it as being an essential difference, which is 
also one of the usual meanings of that vague expres- 
sion at the present day. 

Conceiving the schoolmen to have been justified 
in drawing a broad line of separation between these 
two kinds of classes and of class-distinctions, I shall 
not only retain the division itself, but continue to 
express it in their language. According to that 
language, the proximate (or lowest) Kind to which 
any individual is referrable, is called its species. 
Conformably to this, Sir Isaac Newton would be said 
to be of the species man. There are indeed nume- 
rous sub-classes included in the class man, to which 
Sir Isaac Newton also belongs; as, for example, 
Christian, and Englishman, and Mathematician. But 
these, though distinct classes, are not, in our sense of 
the term, distinct Kinds of men. A Christian, for 
example, differs from other human beings ; but he 
differs only in the attribute which the word expresses, 
namely, belief in Christianity, and whatever else that 
implies, either as involved in the fact itself, or con- 
nected with it through some law of cause and effect. 
We should never think of inquiring what properties, 
unconnected with Christianity, are common to all 
Christians and peculiar to them ; while in regard to 
all Men, physiologists are perpetually carrying on 
such an inquiry ; nor is the answer ever likely to be

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLES. 169 

completed. Man, therefore, we may be permitted 
to call a species ; Christian, or Mathematician, we 
cannot. 

Note here, that it is by no means intended to 
imply that there may not be different Kinds, or logical 
species, of man. The various races and tempera- 
ments, the two sexes, and even the various ages, may 
be differences of kind, within our meaning of the 
term. I say, they may be ; I do not say, they are. 
For in the progress of physiology it may be made out, 
that the differences which distinguish different races, 
sexes, &c., from one another, follow as consequences, 
under laws of nature, from some one or a few primary 
<lifferences which can be precisely determined, and 
which, as the phrase is, account for all the rest. If 
this be so, these are not distinctions in kind ; no more 
than Christian, Jew, Mussulman, and Pagan, a differ- 
ence which also carries many consequences along 
with it. And in this way classes are often mistaken 
for real kinds, which are afterwards proved not to be 
so. But if it shall turn out, that the differences are 
not capable of being accounted for, then man and 
woman, Caucasian, Mongolian, and Negro, &c., are 
really different Kinds of human beings, and entitled to 
be ranked as species by the logician ; though not by 
the naturalist. For (as already hinted) the word 
species is used in a very different signification in logic 
and in natural history. By the naturalist, organized 
beings are never said to be of different species, if it is 
supposed that they could possibly have descended 
from the same stock. That, however, is a sense 
artificially given to the word, for the technical pur- 
poses of a particular science. To the logician, if a 
negro and a white man differ in the same manner, 
(however less in degree) as a horse and a camel do,

170 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

that is, if their differences are inexhaustible, and not 
referrible to any common cause, they are different 
species, whether they are both descended from Noah 
or not. But if their differences can all be traced to 
climate and habits, they are not, in the logician's 
view, specifically distinct. 

When the infima species^ or proximate Kind, to 
which an individual belongs, has been ascertained, 
the properties common to that Kind include necessa- 
rily the whole of the common properties of every 
other real Kind to which the individual can be refer- 
rible. Let the individual, for example, be Socrates, 
and the proximate Kind, man. Animal, or living 
creature, is also a real Kind, and includes Socrates ; 
but since it likewise includes man, or in other words, 
since all men are animals, the properties common to 
animals form a portion of the common properties of 
the sub-class, man : and if there be any class which 
includes Socrates without including man, that class is 
not a real Kind. Let the class, for example, heflaU 
nosed; that being a class which includes Socrates, 
without including all men. To determine whether it 
is a real Kind, we must ask ourselves this question : 
Have all flat-nosed animals, in addition to whatever is 
implied in their flat noses, any common properties, 
other than those which are common to all animals 
whatever ? If they had ; if a flat nose were a mark or 
index to an indefinite number of other peculiarities, 
not deducible from the former by any ascertainable 
law; then out of the class man we might cut another 
class, flat-nosed man, which, according to our defini- 
tion, would be a Kind. But if we could do this, man 
would not be, as it was assumed to be, the proximate 
Kind. Therefore the properties of the proximate Kind 
do comprehend those (whether known or unknown)

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLES. I7l 

of all other Kinds to which the individual belongs ; 
which was the point we undertook to prove. And 
hence, every other Kind which is predicable of the 
individual, will be to the proximate Kind in the 
relation of a genus, according to even the popular 
acceptation of the terms genus and species ; that is, 
it will be a larger class, including it and more. 

We are now able to fix also the logical meaning of 
these terms. Every class which is a real Kind, that 
is, which is distinguished from all other classes by an 
indeterminate multitude of properties not derivable 
from another, is either a genus or a species. A Kind 
which is not divisible into other Kinds, cannot be a 
genus, because it has no species under it ; but it is 
itself a species, both with reference to the individuals 
below and to the genera above, (Species Prsedicabilis 
and Species Subjicibilis.) But every Kind which 
admits of division into real Kinds (as animal into 
quadruped, bird, &c., or quadruped into various 
species of quadrupeds) is a genus to all below it, a 
species to all genera in which it is itself included. And 
here we may close this part of the discussion, and pass 
to the three remaining predicables, Differentia, Pro- 
prium, and Accidens. 

§ 5. To begin with Differentia. This word is 
correlative with the words genus and species, and as 
all agree, it signifies the attribute which distinguishes 
a given species from every other species of the same 
genus. This is so far clear: but which of the distin- 
guishing attributes does it signify ? For we have seen 
that every Kind (and a species must be a Kind) is 
distinguished from other Kinds not by any one 
attribute, but by an indefinite number. Man, for 
instance^ is a species of the genus animal ; Rational

172 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

(or rationality, for it is of no consequence whether 
we use the concrete or the abstract form) is generally 
assigned by logicians as the Differentia; and doubtless 
this attribute serves the purpose of distinction: but it 
has also been remarked of man, that he is a cooking 
animal; the only animal that dresses its food. This, 
therefore, is another of the attributes by which the 
species man is distinguished from other species of the 
same genus : would this attribute serve equally well 
for a differentia ? The Aristotelians say No ; having 
laid it down that the differentia must, like the genus 
and species, be of the essence of the subject. 

And here we lose even that vestige of a meaning 
grounded in the nature of the things themselves, 
which may be supposed to be attached to the word 
essence when it is said that genus and species must 
be of the essence of the thing. There can be no 
doubt that when the schoolmen talked of the essences 
of things as opposed to their accidents, they had 
confusedly in view the distinction between differences 
of kind, and the differences which are not of kind ; 
they meant to intimate that genera and species must 
be Kinds. Their notion of the essence of a thing was 
a vague notion of a something which makes it what 
it is, i. e.y which makes it the Kind of thing that it is 
— ^which causes it to have all that variety of properties 
which distinguish its Kind. But when the matter 
came to be looked at more closely, nobody could 
discover what caused the thing to have all those 
properties, nor even that there was anything which 
caused it to have them. Logicians, however, not 
liking to admit this, and being unable to detect what 
made the thing to be what it was, satisfied themselves 
with what made it to be what it was called. Of the 
innumerable properties, known and unknown, that are

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLES. 173 

Common to the class man, a portion only, and of 
course a very small portion, are connoted by its name: 
these few, however, will naturally have been thus 
distinguished from the rest either for their greater 
obviousness, or for greater supposed importance. 
These properties, then, which were connoted by the 
name, logicians seized upon, and called them the 
essence of the species ; and not stopping there, they 
affirmed them, in the case of the infima species^ to be 
the essence of the individual too; for it was their 
maxim, that the species contained the '' whole essence" 
of the thing. Metaphysics, that fertile field of 
delusion propagated by language, does not afibrd a 
more signal instance of such delusion. On this 
account it was that rationality, being connoted by the 
name man, was allowed to be a differentia of the class ; 
but the peculiarity of cooking their food, not being 
connoted, was relegated to the class of accidental 
properties. 

The distinction, therefore, between Differentia, 
Proprium, and Accidens, is not founded in the nature 
of things^ but in the connotation of names ; and we 
must seek it there if we wish to find what it is. 

From the fact that the genus includes the species, 
in other words, (denotes more than the species, or is 
predicable of a greater number of individuals, it 
follows that the species must connote more than the 
genus. It must connote all the attributes which the 
genus connotes, or there would be nothing to prevent 
it from denoting individuals not included in the 
genus. And it must connote something besides, 
otherwise it would include the whole genus. Animal 
denotes all the individuals denoted by man, and many 
more. Man, therefore, must connote all that animal 
connotes, otherwise there might be men who were

174 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

not animals ; and it must connote something more 
than animal connotes, otherwise all animals would be 
men. This surplus of connotation — ^this which the 
species connotes over and above the connotation of 
the genus — is the Differentia, or specific difference ; 
or, to state the same proposition in other words, the 
Differentia is that which must be added to the conno- 
tation of the genus, to complete the connotation of 
the species. 

The word man, for instance, exclusively of what 
it connotes in common with animal, also connotes 
rationality, and at least some approximation to that 
external form, which we all know, but which, as we 
have no name for it considered in itself, we are 
content to call the human. The differentia, or specific 
difference, therefore, of man, as referred to the genus 
animal, is that outward form and the possession of 
reason. The Aristotelians said, the possession of 
reason, without the outward form. But if they 
adhered to this, they would have been obliged to call 
the Houyhnhms men. The question never arose, and 
they were never called upon to decide how such a 
case would have affected their notion of essentiaUty. 
But, so far as it is possible to determine how language 
would be used in a case which is purely imaginary, 
we may say that the Houyhnhms would not be called 
men, and that the term man, therefore, requires other 
conditions besides rationality. The schoolmen, how- 
ever, were satisfied with taking such a portion of the 
differentia as sufficed to distinguish the species from 
all other existing things, although by so doing they 
might not exhaust the connotation of the name. 

§ 6. And here, to prevent the notion of differentia 
from being restricted within too narrow limits, it is

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLE8. 175 

necessary to remark, that a species, even as referred 
to the same genus, will not always have the same 
differentia, but a different one, according to the prin- 
ciple and purpose which presides over the particular 
classification. For example, a naturalist surveys the 
various kinds of animals, and looks out for the classi- 
fication of them most in accordance with the order in 
which, for zoological purposes, it is desirable that his 
ideas should arrange themselves. With this view he 
finds it advisable that one of his fundamental divisions 
should be into warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals; 
or into animals which breathe with lungs and those 
which breathe with gills; or into carnivorous, and 
frugivorous or graminivorous; or into those which 
walk on the flat part and those which walk on the 
extremity of the foot, a distinction on which some of 
Cuvier's families are founded. In doing this, the 
naturalist creates as many new classes, which are by 
no means those to which the individual animal is fami- 
liarly and spontaneously referred ; nor should we ever 
think of assigning to them so prominent a position in 
our arrangement of the animal kingdom, unless for a 
preconcerted purpose of scientific convenience. And 
to the liberty of doing this there is no limit. In the 
examples we have given, the new classes are real 
Kinds, since each of the peculiarities is an index to a 
multitude of properties belonging to the class which 
it characterizes : but even if the case were otherwise 
— ^if the other properties of those classes could all be 
derived, by any process known to us, from the one 
peculiarity on which the class is founded— even then, 
if those derivative properties were of primary import- 
ance for the purposes of the naturalist, he would be 
warranted in founding his primary division upon 
them.

176 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

If, however, practical convenience is a sufficient 
warrant for making the main demarcations in our 
arrangement of objects run in lines not coinciding 
with any distinction of Kind, and so creating genera 
and species in the popular sense which are not genera 
or species in the rigorous sense at all ; a fortiori must 
we be warranted, when our genera and species are 
real genera and species, in marking the distinction 
between them by those of their properties which 
considerations of practical convenience most strongly 
recommend. If we cut a species out of a given 
genus — the species man, for instance, out of the genus 
animal — with an intention on our part that the pecu- 
liarity by which we are to be guided in the application 
of the name man should be rationality, then rationality 
is the differentia of the species man. Suppose, how- 
ever, that, being naturalists, we, for the purposes of 
our particular study, cut out of the genus animal the 
same species man, but with an intention that the 
distinction between man and all other species of 
animal should be, not rationality, but the possession 
of " four incisors in each jaw, tusks solitary, and 
erect posture/' It is evident that the word man, 
when used by us as naturalists, no longer connotes 
rationality, but connotes the three other properties 
specified ; for that which we have expressly in view 
when we impose a name, assuredly forms part of the 
meaning of that name. We may, therefore, lay it 
down as a maxim, that wherever there is a Genus, and 
a Species marked out from that genus by an assign- 
able differentia, the name of the species must be 
connotative, and must connote the differentia; but 
the connotation may be special, not involved in the 
signification of the term as ordinarily used, but given 
to it when employed as a term of art or science.

The word Man, in common use, connotes rationality 
and a certain form, but does not connote the number 
or character of the teeth : in the linnsean system it 
connotes the number of incisor and canine teeth, but 
does not connote rationality nor any particular form. 
The word man has, therefore, two different meanings ; 
although not commonly considered as ambiguous, 
because it happens in both cases to c^enote the same 
individual objects. But a case is conceivable in which 
the ambiguity would become evident : we have only 
to imagine that some new kind of animal were dis- 
covered, having Linnaeus's three characteristics of 
humanity, but not rational, or not of the human form. 
In ordinary parlance these animals would not be called 
men; but in natural history they must still be called 
so by those, if any there be, who adhere to the 
Linnaean classification ; and the question would arise, 
whether the word should continue to be used in two 
senses, or the classification be given up, and the 
technical sense of the term be abandoned along 
with it. 

Words not otherwise connotative may, in the mode 
just adverted to, acquire a special or technical conno< 
tation. Thus the word whiteness, as we have so often 
remarked, connotes nothing, it merely denotes the 
attribute corresponding to a certain sensation : but if 
we are making a classification of colours, and desire 
to justify, or even merely to point out, the particular 
place assigned to whiteness in our arrangement, we 
may define it, '^ the colour produced by the mixture 
of all the simple rays ;'* and this fact, though by no 
means implied in the meaning of the word whiteness 
as ordinarily used, but only known by subsequent 
scientific investigation, is part of its meaning in the

particular essay or treatise, and becomes the differentia 
of the species*. 

The differentia, therefore, of a species, may be 
defined to be, that part of the connotation of the 
specific name, whether ordinary, or special and tech- 
nical, which distinguishes the species in question from 
aU other species of the genus to which on the par- 
ticular occasion we are rderring it. 

$ 7. Having disposed of Genus, Species, and 
Differentia, we shall not find much difficulty in attain- 
ing a clear conception of the distinction between the 
other two predicables. 

In the Aristotelian phraseology. Genus and Dif- 
ferentia are of the essence of the subject ; by which, as 
we have seen, is really meant that the properties 
signified by the genus and those signified by the 
differentia, form part of the connotation of the name 
denoting the species. Pr(^rium and Acddens, on the 
other hand, form no part of the essence, but are 
predicated of the species only accidentally. Both are 
Accidents in the wider sense, in which the accidents of 
a thing are opposed to its essence ; although, in the 
doctrine of the Predicables, Accidens is used for one 
sort of accident only, Proprium being another sort. 
Proprium, continue the schoolmen, is predicated 
accidentally y indeed, but necessarily: or, as they fur- 
ther explain it, signifies an attribute which is not 



» * If we allow a differentia to what is not really a species. For 
the distinction of Kinds, in the sense explained by us, not being in 
any way applicable to attributes, it of course follows that although 
attributes may be put into classes, those classes can be admitted to 
be genera or species only by courtesy.

indeed part of the essence, but which flows from, or 
is a consequence of, the essence, and is, therefore, 
inseparably attached to the species ; e. g., the various 
properties of a triangle, which, though no part of its 
definition, must necessarily be possessed by whatever 
comes under that definition. Accidens, on the con- 
trary, has no connexion whatever with the essence, 
but may come and go, and the species still remain 
what it was before. If a species could exist without 
its Propria, it must be capable of existing without that 
upon which its Propria are necessarily consequent, 
and therefore without its essence, without that which 
constitutes it a species. But an Accidens, whether 
separable or inseparable from the species in actual 
experience, may be supposed separated, without the 
necessity of supposing any other alteration ; or at 
least, without supposing any of the essential properties 
of the species altered, since with them an Accidens has 
no connexion. 

A Proprium, therefore, of the species, may be 
defined, any attribute which belongs to all the indi- 
viduals included in the species, and which, although 
not connoted by the specific name (either ordinarily 
if the classification we are considering be for ordinary 
purposes, or specially if it be for a special purpose), 
yet follows from some attribute which the name either 
ordinarily or specially connotes. 

One attribute may follow from another in two 
ways ; and there are consequently two kinds of Pro- 
prium. It may follow as a conclusion follows pre- 
misses, or it may follow as an effect follows a cause. 
Thus, the attribute of having the oj^site sides equal, 
which is not one of those connoted by the word 
Parallelogram, nevertheless foUows from those con- 
noted by it, namely, from having the opposite sides 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



180 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

Straight lines, and parallel, and the number of sides 
four. The attribute, therefore, of having the oppo- 
site sides equal, is a Proprium of the class paral- 
lelogram ; and a Proprium of the first kind, which 
follows from the connoted attributes by way of demon'' 
stratioTu The attribute of being capable of under- 
standmg language is a Proprium of the species man, 
since, without being connoted by the word, it follows 
from an attribute which the word does connote, viz., 
from the attribute of rationality. But this is a Pro- 
prium of the second kind, which follows by way of 
causation. How it is that one property of a thmg 
follows, or can be inferred from another ; under what 
conditions this is possible, and what is the exact 
meaning of the phrase; are among the questions' 
which will occupy us in the two succeeding Books. 
At {H-esent it needs only be said, that whether a Pro- 
prium follows by demonstration or by causation, it 
follows necessarily; that is to say, it cannot but 
follow, consistently with some law which we regard 
as a part of the constitution either of our thinking 
faculty or of the universe. 

§ 8. Under the remaining predicable, Accidens, are 
included all attributes of a thing which are neither 
involved in the signification of the name, ^whether 
ordinarily or as a term of art) nor have, so far as we 
know, any necessary connexion with attributes which 
are so involved. They are commonly divided into 
Separable and Inseparable Accidents. Inseparable 
accidents are those which — although we know of no 
connexion between them and the attributes constitu- 
tive of the species, and although, therefore, so far as 
we are aware^ they might be absent without making 
the name inapplicable and the species a different

CLASSIFICATION AND THE PREDICABLBS. 181 

species — are yet never, in fact, known to be absent 
A concise mode of expressing the same meaning is, 
that inseparable accidents are properties which are 
miiversal to the species but not necessary to it. Thus, 
blackness is an attribute of a crow, and, as far as we 
know, an universal one. But if we were to discover 
a race of white birds, in other respects resembling 
crows, we should not say, These are not crows ; we 
should say, These are white crows. Crow, therefore, 
does not connote blackness; nor, from any of the 
attributes which it does connote, whether as a word 
in popular use or as a term of art^ could blackness be 
inferred. Not only, therefore, can we conceive a 
white crow, but we know of no reason why such an 
animal should not exist. Since, however, none but 
black crows are known to exist, blackness, in the 
present state of our knowledge, ranks as an accident, 
but an inseparable accident, of the species crow. 

Separable Accidents are those which are found, in 
point of fact, to be sometimes absent from the species; 
which are not only not necessary, but not even uni- 
versal. They are such as do not belong to every 
individual of the species, but only to some individuals; 
or if to all, not at all times. Thus, the colour of an 
European is one of the separable accidents of the 
species man, because it is not an attribute of all 
human creatures. Being bom, is also a separable 
accident of the species man^ because, although an 
attribute of all human beings, it is so only at one par- 
ticular time. A fortiori those attributes which are 
not constant even in the same individual, as, to be in 
one or in another place, to be hot or cold, sitting or 
walking, must be ranked as separable accidents.

Chapter VIII. 
OF DEFINITION. 

§ 1. One necessary part of the theory of Names 
and of Propositions remains to be treated of in this 
place ; the theory of Definitions. As being the most 
important of the class of propositions which we have 
characterised as purely verbal, they have already 
received some notice in the chapter preceding the 
last. Bat their fuller treatment was at that time 
postponed, because definition is so closely connected 
with classification, that, until the nature of the latter 
process is in some measure understood, the former 
cannot be discussed to much purpose. 

$ 2. The simplest and most correct notion of a 
Definition is, a proposition declaratory of the meaning 
of a word; namely, either the meaning which it 
bears in common acceptation, or that which the 
speaker or writ^, for the particular purposes of his 
discourse, intends to annex to it. 

The definition of a word being the proposition 
which enunciates its meaning, words which have no 
meaning are unsusceptible of definition. Proper 
names, therefore, cannot be defined. A proper name 
being a mere mark put upon an individual, and of 
which it is the characteristic property to be destitute 
of meaning, its meaning cannot of course be declared ; 
though we may indicate by language, as we might 
indicate still more conveniently by pointing with the 
finger, upon what individual that particular mark has 
been, or is intended to be, put. It is no definition of

DEFINITION. 183 

** John Thomson " to say he is ^* the son of General 
Thomson;" for the name John Thomson does not 
express this. Neither is it any definition of '* John 
Thomson ** to say he is *' the man now crossing the 
street." These propositions may serve to make 
known who is the particular man to whom the name 
belongs; but that may be done still more unambi- 
guously by pointing to him, which, however, has not | 
usually been esteemed one of the modes of definition. 

In the case of connotative names, the meaning, as 
has been so often observed, is the connotation ; and 
the definition of a connotative name, is the proposition 
which declares its connotation. This may be done 
either directly or indirectly. The direct mode would 
be by a proposition in this form : " Man " (or what* 
soever the word may be) ''is a name connoting such 
and such attributes," or "is a name which, when 
predicated of anything, signifies the possession of such 
and such attributes by that thing." Or thus : Man 
is everything which possesses such and such attri- 
butes : Man is everything which possesses corporeity, 
organization, life, rationality, and a form resembling 
that of the descendants of Adam. 

This form of definition is the most precise and 
least equivocal of any; but it is not brief enough, and 
is besides too technical and pedantic for common 
discourse. The more usual mode of declaring the 
connotation of a name, is to predicate of it another 
name or names of known signification, which connote 
the same aggregation of attributes. This may be 
done either by predicating of the name mtended to be 
defined, another connotative name exacUy synony- 
mous, as, "Man is a human being," which is not 
commonly accounted a defiilition at all; or by pre- 
dicating two or more connotative names, which make 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



184 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

up among them the whole connotation of the name to 
be defined. In this last case, again, we may either 
compose our definition of as many connotative names 
as there are attributes, each attribute being connoted 
by one; as, Man is a corporeal, organised, animated, 
rational being, shaped so and so ; or we may employ 
names which connote several of the attributes at once, 
as, Man is a rational animal, shaped so and so. 

The definition of a name, according to this view of 
it^ is the sum total of all the essential propositions 
which can be framed with that name for their subject. 
All propositions the truth of which is implied in the 
name, all those which we are made aware of by merely 
hearing the name, are included in the definition if 
complete, and may be evolved from it without the aid 
of any other premisses ; whether the definition ex- 
presses them in two or three words, or in a larger 
number. It is, therefore, not without reason that 
Condillac and other writers have affirmed a definition 
to be an analysis. To resolve any complex whole 
into the elements of which it is compounded, is the 
meaning of analysis ; and this we do when we replace 
one word which connotes a set of attributes collec- 
tively, by two or more which connote the same attri- 
butes singly, or in smaller groups. 

§ 3. From this, however, the question naturally 
arises, in what manner are we to define a name which 
connotes only a single attribute? for instance, "white,** 
which connotes nothing but whiteness; "rational," 
which connotes nothing but the possession of reason. 
It might seem that the meaning of such names could 
only be declared in two ways; by a synonymous term, 
if any such can be found; or in the direct way already 
alluded to : " White is a name connoting the attribute 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION. 185 

whiteness." Let us see, however, whether the ana- 
lysis of the meaning of the name, that is, the break- 
ing down of that meaning into separate parts, admits 
of being carried fiarther. Without at present deciding 
this question as to the word white^ it is obvious that 
in the case of rational some further explanation may 
be given of its meaning than is contanied in the 
proposition, *' Rational is that which possesses the 
attribute of reason;" since the attribute reason itself 
admits of being defined. And here we must turn our 
attention to the definitions of attributes, or rather of 
the names of attributes, that is, of abstract names. 

In regard to such names of attributes as are conno- 
tative, and express attributes of those attributes, there 
is no difficulty : like other connotative names, they are 
defined by declaring their connotation. Thus, the word 
fault may be defined, " a quality productive of evil or 
inconvenience." Sometimes, again, the attribute to 
be defined is not one attribute^ but an union of 
several : we have only, therefore, to put together the 
names of all the attributes taken separately, and we ob- 
tain the definition of the names which belong to them 
all taken together ; a definition which will correspond 
exactly to that of the corresponding concrete name. 
For, as we define a concrete name by enumerating the 
attributes which it connotes, and as the attributes con- 
noted by a concrete name form the entire signification 
of the corresponding abstract one, the same enumera- 
tion will serve for the definition of both. Thus, if the 
definition of a human being be this, ** A being, corpo- 
real, animated, rational, and shaped so and so," the 
definition of humanity will be^ corporeity and animal 
life, combined with rationality, and with such and such 
a shape. 

When, on the other hand, the abstract name does 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



186 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

not express a complication of attributes, but a single 
attribute, we must remember that every attribute is 
groimded upon some fact or phenomenon, from which 
and which alone it derives its meaning* To that fact 
or phenomenon, called in a former chapter the 
foundation of the attribute, we must, therefore, have 
recourse for its definition. Now, the foundation of 
the attribute may be a phenomenon of any degree of 
complexity, consisting of many different parts, either 
coexistent or in successioiL To obtain a definition of 
the attribute, we must analyse the phenomenon into 
these part^. Eloquence, for example, is the name of 
one attribute only; but this attribute is grounded 
upon external effects of a complicated nature, flowing 
from acts of the person to whom we ascribe the 
attribute; and by resolving this phenomenon of 
causation into its two parts, the cause and the effect, 
we obtain a definition of eloquence, viz., the power of 
influencing the affections of human beings by means of 
speech or writing. 

A name, thei'efore, whether concrete or abstract, 
admits of definition, provided we are able to analyse, 
that is, to distinguish into parts, the attribute or set of 
attributes which constitute the meaning both of the 
concrete name and of the corresponding abstract: 
if a set of attributes, by enumerating them; if a 
single attribute, by dissecting the fact or phenomenon 
whether of perception or of internal consciousness, 
which is the foundation of the attribute. But, further, 
even when the fact is one of our simple feelings or 
states of consciousness, and therefore unsusceptible 
of analysis, the names both of the object and of the 
attribute still admit of definition ; or, rather, would do 
so if all our simple feelings had names. Whiteness 
may be defined, the property or power of exciting the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION. 187 

sensation of white. A white object may be defined 
an object which excites the sensation of white. The 
only names which are unsusceptible of definition, 
because their meaning is unsusceptible of analysis^ are 
the names of the simple feelings themselyes. These 
are in the same condition as proper names. They are 
not, indeed, like proper names, unmeanmg; for the 
words sensation of white signify, that the sensation 
which I so denominate resembles other sensations 
which I remember to have had before, and to have 
called by that name. But as we have no words by 
which to recal those former sensations, except the 
very word which we seek to define, or some other 
which, being exactly synonymous with it, requires 
definition as much, words cannot unfold the significa- 
tion of this class of names; and we are obliged to 
make a direct appeal to the personal experience of the 
individual whom we address. 

$ 4. Having stated what seems to be the true idea 
of a Definition, we proceed to examine some opinions 
of philosophers, and some popular conceptions on the 
subject, which conflict more or less with the above. 

The only adequate definition of a name is, as already 
remarked, one which declares the facts, and the whole 
of the facts, which the name involves in its significa- 
tion. But with most persons the object of a defini- 
tion does not embrace so much; they look for nothing 
more, in a definition, than a guide to the correct use of 
the term — a protection against applying it in a manner 
inconsistent with custom and convention. Anything, 
therefore, is to them a sufficient definition of a term, 
which will serve as a correct index to what the term 
denotes; although not embracing the whole, and 
sometimes, perhaps, not even any part, of what it 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



188 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

connotes. This gives rise to two sorts of imperfect, 
or unscientific definitions; namely, Essential but incom- 
plete Definitions, and AccidentalDefinitions,or Descrip- 
tions. In the former, a connotative name is defined by 
a part only of its connotation ; in the latter, by some- 
thing which forms no part of the connotation at all. 

An example of the first kind of imperfect defini- 
tions is the following: — Man is a rational animal. It 
is impossible to consider this as a complete defini- 
tion of the word Man, since (as before remarked) if 
we adhered to it we should be obliged to call the 
Houyhnhms men; but as there happen to be no 
Houyhnhms, this imperfect definition is sufficient to 
mark out and distinguish from all other things, the 
objects at present denoted by •*man;" all the beings 
actually known to exist, of whom the name is predi- 
cable. Though the word is defined by some only 
among the attributes which it connotes, not by all, it 
happens that all known objects which possess the 
enumerated attributes, possess also those which are 
omitted; so that the field of predication which the 
word covers, and the employment of it which |^ 
conformable to usage, are as well indicated by the 
inadequate definition as by an adequate one. Such 
definitions, however, are always liable to be overthrown 
by the discovery of new objects in nature. 

Definitions of this kind are what logicians have 
had in view when they laid down the rule, that the 
definition of a species should be per genus et different 
tiara. Differentia being seldom taken to mean the 
whole of the peculiarities constitutive of the species, 
but some one of those peculiarities only, a complete 
definition would be per genus et differentiaSy rather 
than differentiam. It would include, with the name 
of the superior genus, not merely some attribute which 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION. 189 

distinguishes the species intended to be defined from 
all other species of the same genus, but all the attri- 
butes implied in the name of the species, which the 
name of the superior genus has not already implied. 
The assertion, however, that a definition must of 
necessity consist of a genus and differentiae, is not 
tenable. It was early remarked by logicians, that the 
summum genus in any classification, having no genus 
superior to itself, could not be defined in this manner. 
Yet we have seen that all names, except those of our 
elementary feelings, are susceptible of definition in the 
strictest sense; by setting forth in words the con- 
stituent parts of the fact or phenomenon, of which 
the connotation of every word is ultimately composed. 

$ 5. Although the first kind of imperfect defini- 
tion, (which defines a connotative term by a part only 
of what it connotes, but a part sufficient to mark out 
correctly the boundaries of its denotation), has been 
considered by the ancients, and by logicians in general, 
as a complete definition ; it has always been deemed 
necessary that the attributes employed should really 
form part of the connotation ; for the rule was that 
the definition must be drawn from the essence of the 
class; and this would not have been the case if it had 
been in any degree made up of attributes not con- 
noted by the name. The second kind of imperfect 
definition, therefore, in which the name of a class is 
defined by any of its accidents, — ^that is, by attributes 
which are not included in its connotation, — has been 
rejected from the rank of genuine Definition by all 
philosophers, and has been termed Description. 

This kind of imperfect definition, however, takes 
its rise from the same cause as the other, namely, the 
willingness to accept as a definition anything which, 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



190 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

whether it expounds the meaning of the name or not, 
enables us to discriminate the things denoted by the 
name from all other things^ and consequently to 
employ the term in predication without deviating 
from established uss^e. This purpose is duly an- 
swered by stating any (no matter what) of the attri- 
butes which are common to the whole of the class, 
and peculiar to it; or any combination of attributes 
which may happen to be peculiar to it, although sepa- 
rately each of those attributes may be common to it 
with some other things. It is only necessary that the 
definition (or description) thus formed, should be con- 
vertible with the name which it professes to define ; 
that is, should be exactly co-extensive with it, being 
predicable of everything of which it is predicable, and 
of nothing of which it is not predicable ; although the 
attributes specified may have no connexion with those 
which men had in view when they formed or recog- 
nised the class, and gave it a name. The following 
are correct definitions of Man, according to this test: 
Man is a mammiferous animal, having (by nature) two 
hands (for the human species answers to this descrip- 
tion, and no other animal does) : Man is an animal 
who cooks his food: Man is a featherless biped. 

What would otherwise be a mere description, may 
be raised to the rank of a real definition by the pecu- 
liar purpose which the speaker or writer has in view. 
As was seen in the preceding chapter, it may, for the 
ends of a particular art or science, or for the more 
convenient statement of an author's particular views, 
be advisable to give to some general name, without 
altering its denotation, a special connotation, different 
from its ordinary one. When this is done, a definition 
of the name by means of the attributes which make up 
the special connotation, though in general a mere acci- 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DBPINITION. 191 

dental definition, or descriptioD, becomes on the par- 
ticular occasion and for the particular purpose, a com- 
plete and genuine definition. This actually occurs 
with respect to one of the preceding examples, **Man is 
a mammiferous animal having two hands/' which is the 
scientific definition of man considered as one of the 
species in Cuvier's distribution of the animal kingdom. 
In cases of this sort, although the definition is 
still a declaration of the meaning which in the parti- 
cular instance the name is appointed to convey, it 
cannot be said that to state the meaning of the word 
is the purpose of the definition. The purpose is not 
to expound a name, but to help to expound a classifi- 
cation. The special meaning which Cuvier assigned 
to the word Man, (quite foreign to its ordinary 
meaning, though involving no change in the denota- 
tion of the word,) was incidental to a plan of arranging 
animals into classes on a certain principle^ that is, 
according to a certain set of distinctions. And since 
the definition of Man according to the ordinary conno- 
tation of the word, though it would have answered 
every other purpose of a definition, would not have 
pointed out the place which the species ought to occupy 
in that particular classification ; he gave the word a 
special connotation, that he might be able to define it 
by the kind of attributes upon which, for reasons of 
scientific convenience, he had resolved to found his 
division of animated nature. 

Scientific definitions, whether they are definitions 
of scientific terms or of common terms used in a 
scientific sense, are almost always of the kind last 
spoken of: their main purpose is to serve as the 
landmarks of scientific classification. And since the 
classifications in any science are continually modified 
as scientific knowledge advances, the definitions in the 

Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



192 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

sciences are also constantly varying. A striking 
instance is afforded by the words Acid and Alkali, 
especially the former. As experimental discovery 
advanced, the substances classed with acids have 
been constantly multiplying, and by a natural conse- 
quence the attributes connoted by the word have 
receded and become fewer. At first it connoted the 
attributes, of combining with an alkali to form a 
neutral substance (called a Salt); being compounded of 
a base and oxygen ; causticity to the taste and touch; 
fluidity, &c. The true analysis of muriatic acid, into 
chlorine and hydrogen, caused the second property, 
composition from a base and oxygen, to be excluded 
from the connotation. The same discovery fixed the 
attention of chemists upon hydrogen as an important 
element in acids ; and more recent discoveries having 
led to the recognition of its presence in sulphuric, 
nitric, and many other acids, where its existence was 
not previously suspected, there is now a tendency to 
include the presence of this element in the connotation 
of the word. But carbonic acid, silica, sulphurous 
acid, have no hydrogen in their composition; that 
property cannot therefore be connoted by the term, 
unless those substances are no longer to be considered 
acids. Causticity, and fluidity, have long since been 
excluded from the characteristics of the class, by the 
inclusion of silica and many other substances in it : 
and the formation of neutral bodies by combination 
with alkalis, together with such electro-chemical pecu- 
liarities as this is supposed to imply, are now the 
only differentue which form the fixed connotation of 
the word Acid, as a term of chemical science. 

Scientific men are still seeking, and may be long 
ere they find, a suitable definition of one of the 
earliest words in the vocabulary of the human race, 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION. 193 

and one of those of which the popular sense is plainest 
and best understood. The word I mean is Heat ; and 
the source of the diflSculty is the imperfect state of 
our scientific knowledge, which has shown to us mul- 
titudes of phenomena certainly connected with the 
same power which is the cause of what our senses 
recognise as heat, but has not yet taught us the laws 
of those phenomena with sufiicient accuracy to admit 
of our determining, under what characteristics the 
whole of those phenomena shall ultimately be embo- 
died as a class : which characteristics would of course 
be so many differentiae for the definition of the power 
itself. We have advanced far enough to know that 
one of the attributes connoted must be that of ope- 
rating as a repulsive force : but this is certainly not 
all which must ultimately be included in the scientific 
definition of heat. 

What is true of the definition of any term of 
science, is of course true of the definition of a science 
itself: and accordingly, we showed in the Introduc- 
tory Chapter of this work, that the definition of a 
science must necessarily be progressive and provisional. 
Any extension of knowledge, or alteration in the 
current opinions respecting the subject matter, may 
lead to a change more or less extensive in the parti- 
culars included in the science; and its composition 
being thus altered, it may easily happen that a different 
set of characteristics will be found better adapted as 
differentiae for defining its name. 

In the same manner in which, as we have now 
shown, a special or technical definition has for its 
object to expound the artificial classification out of 
which it grows; the Aristotelian logicians seem to have 
imagined that it was also the business of ordinary 
definition to expound the ordinary, and what they

194 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

deemed the natural, classification of things, namely, 
the division of them into Kinds ; and to show the place 
which each Kind occupies, as superior, collateral, or 
subordinate, among other Kinds. This notion would 
account for the rule that all definition must necessarily 
be per genus et differentiam, and would also explain 
why any one differentia was deemed sufficient. But 
to expound, or express in words, a distinction of Kind, 
has already been shown to be an impossibility: the 
very meaning of a Kind is, that the properties which 
distinguish it do not grow out of one another, and 
cannot therefore be set forth in words, even by impli- 
cation, otherwise than by enumerating them all : and 
all are not known, nor ever will be so. It is idle, 
therefore, to look to this as one of the purposes of a 
definition : while, if it be only required that the defi* 
nition of a Kind should indicate what Kinds include 
it or are included by it, any definitions which expound 
the connotation of the names will do this : for the name 
of each class must necessarily connote enough of its 
properties to fix the boundaries of the class. If the 
definition, therefore, be a full statement of the connota- 
tion, it is all that a definition can be required to be. 

§ 6. Of the two incomplete or unscientific modes 
of definition, and in what they diflfer from the com- 
plete or scientific mode, enough has now been said. 
We shall next examine an ancient doctrine, once 
generally prevalent and still by no means exploded, 
which I regard as the source of a great part of the 
obscurity hanging over some of the most important 
processes of the understanding in the pursuit of 
truth. According to this, the definitions of which we 
have now treated are only one of two sorts into which 
definitions may be divided, viz., definitions of names^

DEFINITION. 195 

and definitions of things. The former are intended to 
explain the meaning of a term ; the latter, the nature 
of a thing; the last being incomparably the most 
important. 

This opinion was held by the ancient philosophers, 
and by their followers, with the exception of the Nomi- 
nalists; but as the spirit of modern metaphysics, 
until a recent period, has been on the whole a Nomi- 
nalist spirit, the notion of definitions of things has 
been to a certain extent in abeyance, still continuing, 
however, to breed confusion in logic, by its conse- 
quences indeed rather than by itself. Yet the doctrine 
in its own proper form now and then breaks out, and 
has appeared (among other places) where it was 
scarcely to be expected, in a deservedly popular work, 
Archbishop Whately's Logic. In a review of that 
work published by me in the Westmiiister Review for 
January 1828, and containing some opinions which 
I no longer entertain, I find the following observa- 
tions on the question now before us; observations 
with which my present views on that question are 
still sufficiently in accordance. 

*' The distinction between nominal and real defini- 
tions, between definitions of words and what are 
called definitions of things, though conformable to the 
ideas of most of the Aristotelian logicians, cannot, as 
it appears to us, be maintained. We apprehend that 
no definition is ever intended to * explain and unfold 
the nature of the thing.' It is some confirmation of 
our opinion, that none of those writers who have 
thought that there were definitions of things, have 
ever succeeded in discovering any criterion by which 
the definition of a thing can be distinguished from any 
other proposition relating to the thing. The defini- 
tion, they say, unfolds the nature of the thing : but 

Dipiz^ by Google 



196 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

no definition can unfold its whole nature ; and every 
proposition in which any quality whatever is predi- 
cated of the thing, unfolds some part of its nature. 
The true state of the case we take to be this. All 
definitions are of names, and of names only: but, in 
some definitions, it is clearly apparent, that nothing is 
intended except to explain the meaning of the word ; 
while in others, besides explaining the meaning of the 
word, it is intended to be implied that there exists a 
thing, corresponding to the word. Whether this be 
or be not implied in any given case, cannot be col- 
lected from the mere form of the expression. * A cen- 
taur is an animal with the upper parts of a man and 
the lower parts of a horse,* and * A triangle is a 
rectilineal figure with three sides,' are, in form, expres- 
sions precisely similar ; although in the former it is 
not implied that any things conformable to the term, 
really exists, while in the latter it is ; as may be seen 
by substituting, in both definitions, the word means 
for is. In the first expression, * A centaur means an 
animal,' &c., the sense would remain unchanged: in 
the second, 'A triangle means,' &c., the meaning 
would be altered, since it would be obviously impos- 
sible to deduce any of the truths of geometry from a 
proposition expressive only of the manner in which 
we intend to employ a particular sign. 

** There are, therefore, expressions, commonly pass- 
ing for definitions, which include in themselves more 
than the mere explanation of the meaning of a term. 
But it is not correct to call an expression of this sort 
a peculiar kind of definition. Its difierence from the 
other kind consists in this, that it is not a definition, 
but a definition and something more. The definition 
above given of a triangle, obviously comprises not 
one, but two propositions, perfectly distinguishable.

DEFINITION. 197 

The one is, * There may exist a figure, bounded by 
three straight lines :' the other, * And this figure may 
be termed a triangle.* The former of these proposi- 
tions is not a definition at all : the latter is a mere 
nominal defimtion, or explanation of the use and 
appUcation of a term. The first is susceptible of 
truth or falsehood, and may therefore be made the 
foundation of a train of reasoning. The latter can 
neither be true nor false; the only character it is 
susceptible of is that of conformity or disconformity 
to the ordinary usage of language." 

There is a real distinction^ then, between defini- 
tions of names, and what are erroneously called defi- 
nitions of things ; but it is, that the latter, along with 
the meaning of a name, covertly asserts a matter of 
fact. This covert assertion is not a definition, but a 
postulate. The definition is a mere identical pro- 
position, which gives information only about the use 
of language, and from which no conclusions affecting 
matters of fact can possibly be drawn. The accom- 
panying postulate, on the other hand, affirms a fact, 
which may lead to consequences of every degree of 
importance. It affirms the real existence of Things 
possessing the combination of attributes set forth in the 
definition ; and this, if true, maybe foundation sufficient 
on which to build a whole fabric of scientific truth. ' 

We have already made, and shall often have to 
repeat, the remark, that the philosophers who over- 
threw Realism by no means got rid of the conse- 
quences of Realism, but retained long afterwards, in 
their own philosophy, numerous propositions which 
could only have a rational meaning £is part of a Realistic 
system. It had been handed down from Aristotle, 
and probably from earlier times, as an obvious truth, 
that the science of Geometry is deduced from defini-

tions. This, so long as a definition was considered 
to be a proposition " unfolding the nature of the 
thing," did well enough. But Hobbes came, and 
rejected utterly the notion that a definition declares 
the nature of the thing, or does anything but state 
the meaning of a name ; yet he continued to affirm as 
broadly as any of his predecessors, that the a/>x«^ 
principiay or original premisses of mathematics, and 
even of all science, are definitions; producing the 
singular paradox, that systems of scientific truth, nay, 
all truths whatever at which we arrive by reasoning, 
are deduced from the arbitrary conventions of man- 
kind concerning the signification of words. 

To save the credit of the doctrine that definitions 
are the premisses of scientific knowledge, the proviso 
is sometimes added, that they are so only under a 
certain condition, namely, that they be framed con- 
formably to the phenomena of nature ; that is, that 
they ascribe such meanings to terms as shall suit 
objects actually existing. But this is only an instance 
of the attempt, too often made, to escape from the 
necessity of abandoning old language after the ideas 
which it expresses have been exchanged for contrary 
ones. From the meaning of a name (we are told) it 
is possible to infer physical facts, provided the name 
has, corresponding to it, an existing thing. But if 
this proviso be necessary, from which of the two is 
the inference really drawn ? from the existence of a 
thing having the properties ? or from the existence of 
a name meaning them ? 

Take, for instance, any of the definitions laid down 
as premisses in Euclid's Elements ; the definition, let 
us say, of a circle. This, being analyzed, consists of 
two propositions ; the one an assumption with respect 
to a matter-of-fact, the other a genuine definition.

DEFINITION. 199 

'* A figure may exist, having all the points in the line 
which bounds it equally distant from a single point 
within it:'' *^Any figure possessing this property is 
called a circle.'' Let us look at one of the demon- 
strations which are said to depend on this definition^ 
and observe to which of the two propositions contained 
in it the demonstration really appeals. " About the 
centre A, describe the circle BCD.'' Here is an 
assumption, that a figure, such as the definition 
expresses, may be described ; which is no other than 
the postulate, or covert assumption, involved in the 
so-called definition. But whether that figure be called 
a circle or not is quite immaterial. The purpose 
would be as well answered, in all respects except brevity, 
were we to say, ** Through the point B, draw a line 
returning into itself, of which every point shall be at 
an equal distance from the point A." By this the 
definition of a circle would be got rid of, and rendered 
needless, but not the postulate implied in it ; without 
that the demonstration could not stand. The circle 
being now described, let us proceed to the conse- 
quence. '* Since B C D is a circle, the radius B A is 
equal to the radius CA." B A is equal to CA, not 
because B C D is a circle, but because B C D is a figure 
with the radii equal. Our warrant for assuming that 
such a figure about the centre A, with the radius 
B A, may be made to exist, is the postulate. — ^The 
admissibility of these assumptions may be intuitive, 
or may admit of proof ; but in either case they are 
the premisses on which the theorems depend; and 
while these are retained it would make no diflference 
in the certainty of geometrical truths, though every 
definition in Euclid, and every technical term therein 
defined, were laid aside. 

It is, perhaps, superfluous to dwell at so much

length upon what is so nearly self-evident ; but when 
a distinction, obvious as it may appear, has been 
confounded, and by men of the most powerful intel- 
lect, it is better to say too much than too little for 
the purpose of rendering such mistakes impossible in 
future. We will, therefore, detain the reader while 
we point out one of the absurd consequences flowing 
from the supposition that definitions, as such, are the 
premisses in any of our reasonings, except such as 
relate to words only. If this supposition were true, 
we might argue correctly from true premisses, and 
arrive at a false conclusion. We should only have to 
assume as a premiss the definition of a non-entity : 
or rather of a name which has no entity corresponding 
to it. Let this, for instance, be our definition: 
A dragon is a serpent breathing flame. 
This proposition, considered only as a definition, is 
indisputably correct. A dragon is a serpent breathing 
flame : the word means that. The tacit assumption, 
indeed, (if there were any such understood assertion,) 
of the existence of an object with properties cor- 
responding to the definition, would, in the present 
instance, be false. Out of this definition we may 
carve the premisses of the following syllogism : 

A dragon is a thing which breathes flame : 

But a dragon is a serpent : 
From which the conclusion is, 

Therefore some serpent or serpents breathe 
flame : — 
an unexceptionable syllogism, in the first mode of 
the third figure, in which both premisses are true and 
yet the conclusion false ; which every logician knows 
to be an absurdity. The conclusion being false and 
the syllogism correct, the premisses cannot be true. 
But the premisses, considered as parts of a definition.

DEFINITION. 201 

are true : there is no possibility of controverting 
them. Therefore, the premisses considered as parts of 
a definition cannot be the real ones. The real pre- 
misses must be : 

A dragon is a really eadsting thing which breathes 
flame : 

A dragon is a really existing serpent : 
which implied premisses being false, the falsity of the 
conclusion presents no absurdity. If we would 
determine what conclusion follows from the same 
ostensible premisses when the tacit assumption of real 
existence is left out, let us, according to the recom- 
mendation in the Westminster Review, substitute means 
for is. We then have: 

A dragon is a word meaning a thing which breathes 
flame: 

A dragon is a word meaning a serpent : 
From which the conclusion is, 

Some word or words which mean a serpent, also 
mean a thing which breathes flame : 
where the conclusion (as well as the premisses) is 
true, and is the only kind of conclusion which can 
ever follow from a definition, namely, a proposition 
relating to the meaning of words. If it relate to 
anything else, we may know that it does not follow 
from the definition, but from the tacit assumption of 
a matter of fact. 

It is only necessary further to inquire, in what 
cases that tacit assumption is really made, and in 
what cases not. Unless we declare the contrary, we 
always convey the impression that we intend to make 
the assumption, when we profess to define any name 
which is already known to be a name of really existing 
objects. On this account it is, that the assumption 
was not necessarily implied in the definition of a

dragon, while there was no doubt of its being included 
in the definition of a circle. 

§ 7. One of the circumstances which have con- 
tributed to keep up the notion, that demonstrative 
truths follow from definitions rather than from the 
postulates implied in those definitions, is, that the 
postulates, even in those sciences which are consi- 
dered to surpass all others in demonstrative certainty, 
are not always exactly true. It is not true that a 
circle exists, or can be described, which has all its 
radii exactly equal. Such accumcy is ideal only; it is 
not found in nature, still less can it be realised by art. 
People had a difficulty, therefore, in conceiving that 
the most certain of all conclusions could rest upon 
premisses which, instead of being certainly true, are 
certainly not true to the whole extent asserted. This 
apparent paradox will be examined when we come to 
treat of Demonstration; where we shall be able to show 
that as much of the postulate is true, as is required 
to support as much as is true of the conclusion. 
Philosophers however to whom this view had not 
occurred, or whom it did not satisfy, have thought it 
indispensable that there should be found in definitions 
something more certain, or at least more accurately 
true, than the implied postulate of the real existence 
of a corresponding object. And this something they 
flattered themselves they had found, when they laid it 
down that a definition is a statement and analysis 
not of the mere meaning of a word, nor yet of the 
nature of a thing, but of an idea. Thus, the pro- 
position, 'A circle is a plane figure bounded by a line 
all the points of which are at an equal distance from 
a given point within it,' was considered by them, not 
as an assertion that any real circle has that property. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEFINITION. 203 

(which would not be exactly true) but that we conceive 
a circle as having it; that our abstract idea of a circle 
is an idea of a figure with its radii exactly equal. 

Conformably to this it is said, that the subject 
matter of mathematics, and of every other demonstra- 
tive science, is not things as they really exist, but 
abstractions of the mind. A geometrical line is a line 
without breadth ; but no such line exists in nature ; it is 
a mere notion made up by the mind, out of the materials 
in nature. The definition (it is said) is a definition of 
this mental line, not of any actual line : and it is only 
of the mental line, not of any line existing in nature, 
that the theorems of geometry are accurately true. 

Allowing this doctrine respecting the nature of 
demonstrative truth to be correct, (which, in a sub- 
sequent place, I shall endeavour to prove that it is 
not) ; even on that supposition, the conclusions which 
seem to follow from a definition, do not follow from 
the definition as such, but from an implied postulate. 
Even if it be true that there is no object in nature 
answering to the definition of a line, and that the 
geometrical properties of lines are not true of any 
lines in nature, but only of the idea of a line ; the 
definition, at all events, postulates the real existence 
of such an idea : it assumes that the mind can frame, 
or rather has framed, the notion of length without 
breadth, and without any other sensible property 
whatever. According to what appears to me the 
sounder opinion, the mind cannot form any such 
notion; it cannot conceive length without breadth; it 
can only, in contemplating objects, attend to their 
length exclusively of their other sensible qualities, 
and so determine what properties may be predicated 
of them in virtue of their length alone. If this be 
true, the postulate involved in the geometrical defi-

204 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS, 

nition of a line, is the real existence, not of length 
without breadth, but merely of length, that is, of long 
objects. This is quite enough to support all the 
truths of geometry, since every property of a geo- 
metrical line is really a property of all physical objects 
possessing length. But even what I hold to be the 
false doctrine on the subject, leaves the conclusion 
that our reasonings are grounded upon the matters of 
fact postulated in definitions, and not upon the defini- 
tions themselves, entirely unaffected ; and accordingly 
I am able to appeal in confirmation of this conclusion, 
to the authority of Mr. Whewell, in his recent treatise 
on The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences. On the 
nature of demonstrative truth, Mr. Whewell's opinions 
are greatly at variance with mine, but on the par- 
ticular point in question it gives me great pleasure to 
observe, that there is a complete agreement between us. 
And here, as in many other instances, I gladly acknow- 
ledge that his writings are eminently serviceable in 
clearing from confusion the initial steps in the analysis 
of the mental processes, even where his views respect- 
ing the ultimate analysis (a matter generally of far less 
importance) are such as (though with unfeigned respect) 
I cannot but regard as fundamentally erroneous. 

§ 8. Although, according to the views here pre- 
sented. Definitions are properly of names only, and 
not of things, it does not follow that definition is an 
easy matter. How to define a name, may not only be 
an inquiry of considerable difficulty and intricacy, but 
may turn upon considerations going deep into the 
nature of the things which are denoted by the name. 
Such, for instance, are the inquiries which form the 
subjects of the most important of Plato's Dialogues; 
as, ** What is rhetoric ?" the topic of the Gorgias, or

DEFINITION. 205 

'* What is justice ?" that of the Republic. Such, also, 
is the question scornfully asked by Pilate, ** What is 
truth?" and the fundamental question with speculative 
moralists in all ages, *' What is virtue?'* 

It would be a mistake to represent these difficult 
and noble inquiries as having nothing in view beyond 
ascertaining the conventional meaning of a name. 
They are inquiries not so much to determine what is^ 
as what should be, the meaning of a name; which, like 
other practical questions of terminology, requires for 
its solution that we should enter^ and sometimes enter 
very deeply, into the properties not merely of names 
but of the things named. 

Although the meaning of every concrete general 
name resides in the attributes which it connotes, the 
objects were named before the attributes ; as appears 
from the fact that in all languages, abstract names are 
mostly compounds or derivatives of the concrete 
names which correspond to them. Connotative 
names^ therefore, were, after proper names, the first 
which were used : and in the simpler cases, no doubt, 
a distinct connotation was present to the minds of 
those who first used the name, and was distinctly 
intended by them to be conveyed by it. The first 
person who used the word whitCy as applied to snow 
or to any other object, knew, no doubt, very well what 
quality he intended to predicate, and had a perfectly 
distinct conception in his mind of the attribute sig- 
nified by the name. 

But where the resemblances and differences on 
which our classifications are founded are not of this 
palpable and easily determinable kind ; especially where 
they consist not in any one quaUty but in a number 
of qualities, the effects of which being blended toge- 
ther are not very easily discriminated and referred

206 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

each to its true source ; it often happens that names 
are applied to nameable objects, with no distinct 
connotation present to the minds of those who apply 
them. They are only influenced by a general resem- 
blance between the new object and all or some of the 
old familiar objects which they have been accustomed 
to call by that name. This, as we have seen, is the 
law which even the mind of the philosopher must 
follow, in giving names to the simple elementary 
feelings of our nature : but, where the things to be 
named are complex wholes, a philosopher is not con- 
tent with noticing a general resemblance; he examines 
what the resemblance consists in ; and he only gives 
the same name to things which resemble one another 
in the same definite particulars. The philosopher, 
therefore, habitually employs his general names with 
a definite connotation. But language was not made, 
and can only in some small degree be mended, by 
philosophers. In the minds of the real arbiters of 
language, general names, especially where the classes 
they denote cannot be brought before the tribunal of 
the outward senses to be identified and discriminated, 
connote little more than a vague gross resemblance to 
the things which they were earliest, or have been 
most, accustomed to call by those names. When, for 
instance, ordinary persons predicate the words just or 
unjust of any action, . noble or mean of any senti- 
ment, expression, or demeanour, statesman or charlatan 
of any personage figuring in politics, do they mean to 
aflirm of those various subjects, any determinate 
attributes, of whatever kind ? No : they merely 
recognise, as they think, some likeness, more or less 
vague and loose, between them and some other things 
which they have been accustomed to denominate or to 
hear denominated by those appellations.

DEFINITION. 207 

Language, as Sir James Mackintosh used to say 
of governments, *' is not made, but grows." A name 
is not imposed at once and by previous purpose upon 
a class of objects, but is first applied to one thing, 
and then extended by a series of transitions to another 
and another. By this process, (as has been remarked 
by several writers, and illustrated with great force and 
clearness by Dugald Stewart, in his Philosophical 
Essays,) a name not unfrequently passes by successive 
links of resemblance from one object to another, 
until it becomes applied to things having nothing in 
common with the first things to which the name was 
given ; which, however, do not, for that reason, drop 
the name; so that it at last denotes a confused huddle 
of objects, having nothing whatever in common ; and 
connotes nothing, not even a vague and general resem- 
blance. When a name has fallen into this state, in 
which by predicating it of any object we assert 
literally nothing about the object, it has become 
unfit for the purposes either of thought or of the 
communication of thought; and can only be made 
serviceable by stripping it of some part of its multi- 
farious denotation, and confining it to objects pos- 
sessed of some attributes in common, which it may be 
made to connote. Such are the inconveniences of a 
language which " is not made, but grows." Like a 
road which is not made but has made itself, it requires 
continual mending in order to be passable. 

From this it is already evident, why the question 
respecting the definition of an abstract name is often 
one of so much difficulty. The question. What is 
justice? is, in other words, What is the attribute 
which mankind mean to predicate when they call an 
action just? To which the first answer is, that having 
come to no precise agreement on the point, they do 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



208 NAMES AND PROPOSITIONS. 

not mean to predicate distinctly any attribute at all. 
Nevertheless, all believe that there is some common 
attribute belonging to all the actions which they are 
in the habit of calling just. The question then must 
be, whether there is any such common attribute? 
and, in the first place, whether mankind agree suffi- 
ciently with one another as to the particular actions 
which they do or do not call just, to render the 
inquiry, what quality those actions have in common, 
a possible one : if so, whether the actions really have 
any quality in common ; and if they have, what it is. 
Of these three, the first alone is an inquiry into usage 
and convention ; the other two are inquiries into 
matters of fact. And if the second question, (whether 
the actions form a class at all,) has been answered 
negatively, there remains a fourth, often more arduous 
than all the rest, namely, how best to form a class 
artificially, which the name may denote. 

And here it is fitting to remark, that the study of 
the spontaneous growth of languages is of the utmost 
importance to the philosopher who would logically 
remodel them. The classifications judely made by 
established language, when retouched, as they almost 
always require to be, by the hands of the logician, are 
often in themselves excellently suited to many of his 
purposes. When compared with the classifications of 
a philosopher, they are like the customary law of a 
country, which has grown up as it were sponta- 
neously, compared with laws methodized and digested 
into a code : the former are a far less perfect instru- 
ment than the latter; but being the result of a long, 
though unscientific, course of experience, they contain 
the greater part of the materials out of which the 
systematic body of written law may and ought to be 
formed. In like manner, the established grouping of

DEFINITION. 209 

objects under a common name, though it may be 
founded only upon a gross and general resemblance, 
is evidence, in the first place, that the resemblance is 
obvious, and therefore considerable; and, in the next 
place, that it is a resemblance which has struck great 
numbers of persons during a series of years and ages. 
Even when a name, by successive extensions, has 
come to be applied to things among which there does 
not exist even a gross resemblance common to them 
all, still at every step in its progress we shall find such 
a resemblance. And these transitions of the mean- 
ing of words are often an index to real connexions 
between the things denoted by them, which might 
otherwise escape the notice even of philosophers ; of 
those at least who, from using a different language, or 
from any difference in their habitual associations, 
have fixed their attention in preference upon some 
other aspect of the things. The history of philosophy 
abounds in examples of such oversights, which would 
not have been committed if a philosopher had seen 
the hidden link that connected together the seemingly 
disparate meanings of some ambiguous word*. 



* ** Few people" (I have said in another place) " have reflected 
how great a knowledge of Things is required to enable a man to 
affirm that any given argument turns wholly upon words. There 
isy perhaps, not one of the leading terms of philosophy which is 
not used in almost innumerable shades of meaning, to express ideas 
more or less widely different from one another. Between two of 
these ideas a sagacious and penetrating mind will discern, as it 
were intuitively, an unobvious link of connection, upon which, 
though perhaps unable to give a logical account of it, he will found 
a perfectly valid argument, which his critic, not having so keen an 
insight into the Things, will mistake for a fallacy turning on the 
double meaning of a term. And the greater the genius of him 
who thus safely leaps over the chasm, the greater will probably be 
the crowing and vain-glory of the mere logician, who, hobbling

Whenever the inquiry into the definition of the 
name of any real object consists of anything else than 
a mere comparison of authorities, we tacitly assume 
that a meaning must be found for the name, compa- 
tible with its continuing to denote, if possible all, but 
at any rate the greater or the more important part, 
of the things of which it is commonly predicated. 
The inquiry, therefore, into the definition, is an 
inquiry into the resemblances and difierences among 
those things: whether there be any resemblance 
running through them all; if not, through what 
portion of them such a general resemblance can be 
traced : and finally, what are the common attributes, 
the possession of which gives to them all, or to that 
portion of them, the character of resemblance which 
has led to their being classed together. When these 
common attributes have been ascertained and speci- 
fied, the name which belongs in common to the 
resembling objects, acquires a distinct instead of a 
vague connotation; and by possessing this distinct 
connotation, becomes susceptible of definition. 

In giving a distinct connotation to the general 
name, the philosopher will endeavour to fix upon such 
attributes as, while they are common to all the things 
usually denoted by the name, are also of greatest 
importance in themselves, either directly, or from 
the number, the conspicuousness, or the interesting 
character, of the consequences to which they lead. 
He will select, as far as possible, such differentia as 
lead to the greatest number of interesting propria. 
For these, rather than the more obscure and recondite 



after him, evinces his own superior wisdom by pausing on its 
brink, and giving up as desperate his proper business of bridging it 
over."

qualities on which they often depend, give that general 
character and aspect to a set of objects, which deter- 
mine the groups into which they naturally fall. But 
to mount up to the more hidden agreement upon 
which these obvious and superficial agreements de- 
pend, is often one of the most difficult of scientific 
problems. As it is among the most difficult, so it 
seldom fails to be among the most important. And 
since upon the result of this inquiry respecting the 
causes of the properties of a class of things, there 
incidentally depends the question what shall be the 
meaning of a word ; some of the most profound and 
most valuable investigations which philosophy pre- 
sents to us, have been introduced by, and have offered 
themselves under the guise of, inquiries into the 
definition of a name.

Chapter I. 
OF INFERENCE, OR REASONING, IN GENERAL. 

§ 1. In the preceding Book, we have been occupied 
not with the nature of Proof, but with the nature of 
Assertion : the import conveyed by a Proposition, 
whether that Proposition be true or false; not the 
means by which to discriminate true from false Pro- 
positions. The proper subject, however, of Logic is 
Proof. Before we could understand what Proof is, 
it was necessary to imderstand what that is to which 
proof is applicable ; what that is which can be a subject 
of belief or disbelief, of affirmation or denial ; what, in 
short, the different kinds of Propositions assert. 

This preliminary inquiry we have prosecuted to a 
lefinite result. Assertion, in the first place, relates 
•ither to the meaning of words, or to some property 
of the things which words signify. Assertions re- 
specting the meaning of words, among which defini- 
tions are the most important, hold a place, and an 
indispensable one, in philosophy ; but as the meaning 
of words is essentially arbitrary, this class of assertions 
are not susceptible of truth or falsity, nor therefore 
of proof or disproof. Assertions respecting Things, 
or what may be called Real Propositions in contra- 
distinction to verbal ones, are of various sorts. We 
have analyzed the import of each sort, and have ascer- 
tained the nature of the things they relate to, and 
the nature of what they severally assert respecting 
those things. We found that whatever be the form 
of the proposition, and whatever its nominal subject 
or predicate, the real subject of every proposition is

216 REASONING. 

some one or more facts or phenomena of consciousness^ 
or some one or more of the hidden causes or powers to 
which we ascribe those facts ; and that what is pre- 
dicated or asserted^ either in the affirmative or negative, 
of those phenomena or those powers, is always either 
Existence, Order in Place, Order inTime, Causation, or 
Resemblance. This, then, is the theory of the Import 
of Propositions, reduced to its ultimate elements : but 
there is another and a less abstruse expression for it, 
which, though stopping short in an earlier stage of the 
analysis, is sufficiently scientific for many of the pur- 
poses for which such a general expression is required. 
This expression recognises the commonly received 
distinction between Subject and Attribute, and gives 
the following as the analysis of the meaning of pro- 
positions: — Every Proposition asserts, that some given 
given subject does or does not possess some attribute; 
or that some attribute is or is not (either in all or 
in some portion of the subjects in which it is met 
with) conjoined with some other attribute. 

We shall now for the present take our leave of 
this portion of our inquiry, and proceed to the peculiar 
problem of the Science of Logic, namely, how the 
assertions, of which we have analysed the import, are 
proved, or disproved : such of them, at least, as, not 
being amenable to direct consciousness or intuition, 
are appropriate subjects of proof. 

We say of a fact or statement, that it is proved, 
when we believe its truth by reason of some other 
fact or statement from which it is said to follow. Most 
of the propositions, whether affirmative or negative, 
universal, particular, or singular, which we believe, 
are not believed on their own evidence, but on the 
ground of something previously assented to, and from 
which they are said to be inferred. To infer a pro-

position from a previous proposition or propositions ; 
to give credence to it, or claim credence for it, as a 
conclusion from something else ; is to reason^ in the 
most extensive sense of the term. There is a narrower 
sense, in which the name reasoning is confined to the 
form of inference which is termed ratiocination, and 
of which the syllogism is the general type. The 
reasons for not conforming to this restricted use of 
the term were stated in an early stage of our inquiry, 
and additional motives will be suggested by the con- 
siderations on which we are now about to enter. 

4 2. In proceeding to take into consideration the 
cases in which inferences can legitimately be drawn, 
we shall first mention some cases in which the infe- 
rence is apparent, not real ; and which require notice 
chiefly that they may not be confounded with cases of 
inference properly so called. This occurs when the 
proposition ostensibly inferred from another, appears 
on analysis to be merely a repetition of the same, or 
part of the same, assertion, which was contained in 
the first* All the cases mentioned in books of Logic, 
as examples of iEquipollency or equivalence of pro- 
positions, are of this nature. Thus, if we were to 
argue. No man is incapable of reason, for every man 
is rational; or. All men are mortal, for no man is 
exempt from death; it would be plain that we were not 
proving the proposition, but only appealing to another 
mode of wording it, which may or may not be more 
readily comprehensible by the hearer, or better adapted 
to suggest the real proof, but which contains in itself 
no shadow of proof. 

Another case is where, from an universal proposi- 
tion, we affect to infer another which differs from it 
only in being particular : as, All A is B, therefore 

Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



218 REASONING. 

Some A is B : No A is B, therefore Some A is not B. 
This, too, is not to conclude one proposition from 
another, but to repeat a second time something which 
had been asserted at first; with the diflference, that 
we do not here repeat the whole of the previous asser- 
tion, but only an indefinite part of it. 

A third case is, where, the antecedent having 
affirmeji a predicate of a given subject, the conse- 
quent affirms of the same subject something akeady 
connoted by the former predicate : as, Socrates is a 
man, therefore Socrates is a living creature; where 
all that is connoted by living creature was affirmed of 
Socrates when he was asserted to be a man. If the 
propositions are negative, we must invert their order, 
thus : Socrates is not a living creature, therefore he 
is not a man ; for if we deny the less, the greater, 
which includes it, is already denied by implication. 
These, therefore, are not really cases of inference; 
and yet the trivial examples by which, in manuals of 
Logic, the rules of the syllogism are illustrated, are 
often of this ill-chosen kind ; demonstrations in form, 
of conclusions to which whoever understands the 
terms used in the statement of the data, has already, 
and consciously, assented. 

The most complex case of this sort of apparent 
inference is what is called the Conversion of Proposi- 
tions ; which consists in making the predicate become 
a subject, and the subject become a predicate, and 
framing out of the same terms, thus reversed, another 
proposition, which must be true if the former is true. 
Thus, from the particular affirmative proposition. Some 
A is B, we may infer that Some B is A. From the 
universal negative, No A is B, we may conclude that 
No B is A. From the universal affirmative proposi- 
tion, All A is B, it cannot be inferred that All B is A; 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



INFERENCE IN GENERAL. 219 

though all water is liquid, it is not implied that all 
liquid is water ; but it is implied that some liquid is 
so ; and hence the proposition, All A is B, is legiti- 
mately convertible into Some B is A. This process, 
which converts an universal proposition into a parti- 
cular, is termed conversion per accidens. From the 
proposition, Some A is not B, we cannot even infer 
that some B is not A: though some men are not 
Englishmen, it does not follow that some Englishmen 
are not men. The only legitimate conversion, if such 
it can be called, of a particular negative proposition, 
is in the form. Some A is not B, therefore, something 
which is not B is A ; and this is termed conversion 
by contraposition. In this case, however, the predi- 
cate and subject are not merely reversed, but one of 
them is altered. Instead of [AJ and [B], the terms 
of the new proposition are [a thing which is not B], 
and [A]. The original proposition, Some A is not B, 
is first changed into a proposition aequipollent with it, 
Some A tf ** a thing which is not B ;" and the pro- 
position, being now no longer a particular negative, 
but a particular affirmative, admits of conversion in 
the first mode, or, as it is called, simple conversion. 

In all these cases there is not really any inference; 
there is in the conclusion no new truth, nothing but 
what was already asserted in the premisses, and obvious 
to whoever apprehends them. The fact asserted in 
the conclusion is either the very same fact, or part of 
the fact, asserted in the original proposition. This 
follows from our previous analysis of the Import of 
Propositions. When we say, for example, that some 
lawfiil sovereigns are tyrants, what is the meaning of 
the assertion ? That the attributes connoted by the 
term *' lawful sovereign,*' and the attributes connoted 
by the term '* tyrant,*' sometimes coexist in the same

220 RBASONINO. 

iudividual. Now this is also precisely what we mean, 
when we say that some tyrants are lawful sovereigns ; 
which, therefore, is not a second proposition inferred 
from the first, any more than the English translation 
of Euclid's Elements is a collection of theorems 
different from, and consequences of, those contained 
in the Greek original. Again, if we assert that no 
great general is a fool, we mean that the attributes 
connoted by ** great general/* and those connoted by 
" fool,*' never coexist in the same subject ; which is 
also the exact meaning which we express when we 
say, that no fool is a great general. When we say, 
that all quadrupeds are warm-blooded, we assert, not 
only that the attributes connoted by ** quadruped" 
and those connoted by " warm-blooded '* sometimes 
coexist, but that the former never exist without the 
latter: now the proposition. Some warm-blooded 
creatures are quadrupeds, expresses the first half of 
this meaning, dropping the latter half; and, therefore, 
has been already affirmed in the antecedent proposi- 
tion, All quadrupeds are warm-blooded. But that all 
warm-blooded creatures are quadrupeds, or, in other 
words, that the attributes connoted by "warm-blooded" 
never exist without those connoted by " quadruped," 
has not been asserted, and cannot be inferred. In 
order to reassert, in an inverted form, the whole of 
what was affirmed in the proposition, All quadrupeds 
are warm-blooded, we must convert it by contraposi- 
tion, thus, Nothing which is not warm-blooded is a 
quadruped. This proposition, and the one fi"om which 
it is derived, are exactly equivalent, and either of them 
may be substituted for the other; for, to say that 
when the attributes of a quadruped are present, those 
of a warm-blooded creature are present, is to say, that 
when the latter are absent the former are absent.

In a manual for young students, it would be 
proper to dwell at greater length upon the conversion 
and aequipoUency of propositions. For, although that 
cannot be called reasoning or inference which is a 
mere reassertion in different words of what had been 
asserted before, there is no more important intellectual 
habit, nor any the cultivation of which falls more 
strictly within the province of the art of logic, than 
that of discerning rapidly and surely the identity of 
an assertion when disguised imder diversity of Ian- 
guage. That important chapter in logical treatises 
which relates to the Opposition of Propositions, and 
the excellent technical language which logic provides 
for distinguishing the different kinds or modes of 
opposition, are of use chiefly for this purpose. Such 
considerations as these, that contrary propositions 
may both be false, but cannot both be true; that 
sub-contrary propositions may both be true, but 
cannot both be felse ; that of two contradictory pro- 
positions one must be true and the other false ; that 
of two subaltemate propositions the truth of the 
universal proves the truth of the particular, and the 
falsity of the particular proves the falsity of the 
universal, but not vice versd^; are apt to appear, at 
first sight, very technical and mysterious, but when

explained, seem almost too obvious to require so 
formal a statement, since the same amount of expla- 
nation which is necessary to make the principles 
intelligible, would enable the truths which they 
convey to be apprehended in any particular case 
which can occur. In this respect, however, these 
axioms of logic are on a level with those of mathe- 
matics. That things which are equal to the same 
thing are equal to one another, is as obvious in any 
particular case as it is in the general statement : and 
if no such general maxim had ever been laid down, 
the demonstrations in Euclid would never have halted 
for any difficulty in stepping across the gap which 
this axiom at present serves to bridge over. Yet 
no one bas ever censured writers on geometry, for 
placing a list of these elementary generalizations at 
the head of their treatises, as a first exercise to the 
learner of the faculty which will be required in him at 
every step, that of apprehending a general truth. 
And the student of logic, in the discussion even of 
such truths as we have cited above, acquires habits of 
circumspect interpretation of words, and of exactly 
measuring the length and breadth of his assertions, 
which are among the most indispensable conditions of 
any considerable attainment in science, and which it 
is one of the primary objects of logical discipUne to 
cultivate. 

§ 8. Having noticed, in order to exclude from the 
province of Reasoning or Inference properly so called, 
the cases in which the progress from one truth to 
another is only apparent, the logical consequent being 
a mere repetition of the logical antecedent ; we now 
pass to those which are cases of inference in the 
proper acceptation of the term, those in which we set 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



INFERENCE IN GENERAL. 223 

out from known truths, to arrive at others really 
distinct from them. 

Reasoning, in the extended sense in which I use 
the term, and in which it is synonymous with 
Inference, is popularly said to be of two kinds: 
reasoning from particulars to generals, and reason- 
ing from generals to particulars ; the former being 
called Induction, the latter Ratiocination or Syllogism. 
It will presently be shown that there is a third species 
of reasoning, which falls under neither of these 
descriptions, and which, nevertheless, is not only 
valid, but the foundation of both the others. 

It is necessary to observe, that the expressions, 
reasoning from particulars to generals, and reasoning 
from generals to particulars, are recommended by 
brevity rather than by precision, and do not ade- 
quately mark, without the aid of a commentary, the 
distinction between Induction and Ratiocination. The 
meaning intended by these expressions is, that Induc- 
tion is inferring a proposition from propositions less 
general than itself, and Ratiocination is inferring a 
proposition from propositions equally or more general. 
When, from the observation of a number of individual 
instances, we ascend to a general proposition, or when, 
by combining a number of general propositions, we 
conclude from them another proposition still more 
general, the process, which is substantially the same 
in both instances, is called Induction. When from a 
general proposition, not alone (for from a single 
proposition nothing can be concluded which is not 
involved in the terms,) but by combining it with other 
propositions, we infer a proposition of the same degree 
of generality with itself, or a less general proposition, 
or a proposition merely individual, the process is 
Ratiocination. When, in short, the conclusion is 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



224 REASONING. 

more general than the largest of the premisses, the 
argument is commonly called Induction ; when less 
general, or equally general, it is Ratiocination. 

As all experience begins with individual cases, and 
proceeds from them to generals, it might seem most 
conformable to the natural order of thought that 
Induction should be treated of before we touch upon 
Ratiocination. It will, however, be advantageous, in 
a science which aims at tracing our acquired know- 
ledge to its sources, that the inquirer should com- 
mence with the later rather than with the earlier 
stages of the process of constructing our knowledge ; 
and should trace derivative truths backward to the 
truths from which they are deduced, and upon which 
they depend for their evidence, before attempting to 
point out the original spring from which both ulti- 
mately take their rise. The advantages of this order 
of proceeding in the present instance will manifest 
themselves as we advance, in a manner superseding the 
necessity of any further justification or explanation. 

Of Induction, therefore, we shall say no more at 
present, than that it at least is, without doubt, a 
process of real inference. The conclusion in an 
induction embraces more than is contained in the 
premisses. The principle or law collected from par- 
ticular instances, the general proposition in which we 
embody the result of our experience, covers a much 
larger extent of ground than the individual experi- 
ments which are said to form its basis. A principle 
ascertained by experience, is more than a mere 
summing up of what we have specifically observed in 
the individual cases that we have examined ; it is a 
generalisation grounded on those cases, and expressive 
of our belief, that what we there found true is true 
in an indefinite number of cases which we have not

INFERENCE IN GENERAL. 225 

examined, and are never likely to examine. The 
nature and grounds of this inference, and the condi- 
tions necessary to make it legitimate, will be the 
subject of discussion in the Third Book : but that 
such inference really takes place is not susceptible of 
question. In every induction we proceed from truths 
which we knew, to truths which we did not know; 
from facts certified by observation, to facts which we 
have not observed, and even to facts not capable of 
being now observed; future facts, for example; but 
which we do not hesitate to believe upon the sole 
evidence of the induction itself. 

Induction, then, is a real process of Reasoning or 
Inference. Whether, and in what sense, so much can 
be said of the Syllogism, remains to be determined by 
the examination into which we are about to enter.

Chapter II, 
OF RATIOCINATION, OR SYLLOGISM. 

$ 1. The analysis of the Syllogism has been so 
accurately and fiilly performed in the common manuals 
of Logic, that in the present work, which is not 
designed as a manual, it is sufficient to recapitulate, 
memoruB causdy the leading results of that analysis, 
as a foundation for the remarks to be afterwards made 
upon the functions of the syllogism, and the place 
which it holds in philosophy. 

To a legitimate syllogism it is essential that there 
should be three, and no more than three, propositions, 
namely, the conclusion, or proposition to be proved, 
and two other propositions which together prove it, 
and which are called the premisses. It is essential 
that there should be three, and no more than three 
terms, namely, the subject and predicate of the con- 
clusion, and another called the middleterm, which 
must be found in both premisses, since it is by means 
of it that the other two terms are to be connected 
together. The predicate of the conclusion is called 
the major term of the syllogism; the subject of the 
conclusion is called the minor term. As there can 
be but three terms, the major and minor terms must 
each be found in one, and only one, of the premisses, 
together with the middleterm which is in them both. 
The premiss which contains the middleterm and the 
major term is called the major premiss ; that which 
contains the middleterm and the minor term is called 
the minor premiss of the syllogism. 

Syllogisms are divided by some logicians into 



Digitized

RATIOCINATION, OR SYLLOGISM. 



227 



three figuresy by others into four, according to the 
position of the middleterm, which may either be the 
subject in both premisses, the predicate in both, or 
the subject in one and the predicate in the other. 
The most common case is that in which the middle- 
term is the subject of the major premiss and the 
predicate of the minor. This is reckoned as the first 
figure. When the middleterm is the predicate in 
both premisses, the syllogism belongs to the second 
figure; when it is Ihe subject in both, to the third. 
In the fourth figure the middleterm is the subject of 
the minor premiss and the predicate of the major. 
Those writers who reckon no more than three figures, 
include this case in the first. 

Each figure is subdivided into modes, according to 
what are called the quantity and quality of the propo- 
sitions, that is, according as they are universal or 
particular, affirmative or negative. The following are 
examples of all the legitimate modes, that is, all those 
in which the conclusion correctly follows from the 
premisses. A is the minor term, C the major, B the 
middleterm.

In these exemplars, or blank forms for making 
syllogisms, no place is assigned to singular propo- 
sitions ; not, of course, because such propositions are 
not used in ratiocination, but because, their predicate 
being aflSrmed or denied of the whole of the subject, 
they are ranked, for the purposes of the syllogism, 
with universal propositions. Thus, these two syllo- 
gisms — 

All men are mortal, All men are mortal, 

All kings are men, Socrates is a man, 

therefore therefore 

All kings are mortal, Socrates is mortal, 

are arguments precisely similar, and are both ranked 
in the first mode of the first figure. 

The reasons why syllogisms in any of the above 
forms are legitimate, that is, why, if the premisses be 
true, the conclusion must necessarily be so, and why 
this is not the case in any other possible mode^ that 
is, in any other combination of universal and par- 
ticular, affirmative and negative propositions, any 
person taking interest in these inquiries may be pre- 
sumed to have either learnt from the common school 
books of the syllogistic logic, or to be capable of 
divining for himself. The reader may, however, be 
referred, for every needful explanation, to Archbishop 
Whately's Elements of Logic, where he will find 
stated with philosophical precision, and explained 
with peculiar perspicuity, the whole of the common 
doctrine of the syllogism.

RATIOCINATION, OR SYLLOGISM. 229 

All valid ratiocination ; all reasoning by which, 
from general propositions previously admitted, other 
propositions equally or less general are inferred ; may 
be exhibited in some of the above forms. The whole 
of Euclid, for example, might be thrown without 
difficulty into a series of syllogisms, regular in mode 
and figure. 

Although a syllogism framed according to any of 
these formulae is a vaUd argument, all correct ratioci- 
nation admits of being stated in syllogisms of the 
first figure along. The niles for throwing an argu- 
ment in any of the other figures into the first figure, 
are called rules for the reduction of syllogisms. It is 
done by the conversixm of one or other, or both, of the 
premisses. Thus, an argument in the first mode of 
the second figure, as — 

No C is B 

All A is B 

therefore 

No A is C, 

may be reduced as follows. The proposition, No C 
is B, being an universal negative, admits of simple 
conversion, and may be changed into No B is C, 
which, as we showed, is the very same assertion in 
other words — the same fact differently expressed. This 
transformation having been effected, the argument 
assumes the following form : — 

No B is C 

All A is B 

therefore 

No A is C, 

which is a good syllogism in the second mode of the 
first figure. Again, an argument in the first mode of 
the third figure must resemble the following : — 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



230 REASONING. 

AH B is C 
All B is A 
therefore 
Some A is C, 
where the minor premiss, All B is A, conformably to 
what was laid down in the last chapter respecting 
universal afltanatives, does not admit of simple con- 
version, but may be converted per acddens, thus. 
Some A is B ; which, though it does not express the 
whole of what is asserted in the proposition All B is 
A, expresses, as was formerly shown, part of it, and 
must therefore be true if the whole is true. We have, 
then, as the result of the reduction, the following 
syllogism in the third mode of the first figure : — 
AUBisC 
Some A is B, 
from which it obviously follows, that 
Some A is C. 
In the same manner, or in a manner on which, 
after these examples, it is not necessary to enlarge, 
every mode of the second, third, and fourth figures 
may be reduced to some one of the four modes of the 
first. In other words, every conclusion which can be 
proved in any of the last three figures, may be proved 
in the first figure from the same premisses, with a 
slight alteration in the mere manner of expressing 
them. Every valid ratiocination, therefore, may be 
stated in the first figure, that is, in one of the follow- 
ing forms: —

Although all ratiocination admits of being thrown 
into one or the other of these forms , and sometimes 
gains considerably by the transformation! both in 
clearness and in the obviousness of its consequence ; 
there are, no doubt, cases in which the argument falls 
more naturally into one of the other three figures, and 
in which its conclusiveness is more apparent at the 
first glance in those figures, than when reduced into 
the first. Thus, if the proposition were that pagans 
may be virtuous, and the evidence to prove it were

the example of Aristides; a syllogism in the third 
figure, 

Aristides was virtuous, 
Aristides was a pagan, 

therefore 
Some pagan was virtuous, 

would be a more natural mode of stating the argu- 
ment, and would carry conviction more instantly 
home, than the same ratiocination strained into the 
first figure, thus — 

Aristides was virtuous. 
Some pagan was Aristides, 

therefore 
Some pagan was virtuous. 

A German philosopher, Lambert, whose Neues 
Organon (published in the year 1 764) contains among 
other things the most elaborate and complete expo- 
sition of the syllogistic doctrine which I have hap- 
pened to meet with, has expressly examined what 
sorts of arguments fall most naturally and suitably 
into each of the four figures; and his solution is 
characterized by great ingenuity and clearness of 
thought*. The argument, however, is one and the 



* His conclusions are, *' The first figure is suited to the dis- 
covery or proof of the properties of a thing ; the second to the 
discovery or proof of the distinctions between things ; the third to 
the discovery or proof of instances and exceptions ; the fourth to 
the discovery, or exclusion, of the different species of a genus." 
The reference of syllogisms in the last three figures to the dictum 
de omni et ntdlo is, in Lambert's view, strained and unnatural : to 
each of the three belongs, according to him, a separate axiom, co-or- 
dinate and of equal authority with that dictum, and to which he 
gives the names of dictum de diverto for the second figure, dictum de

same, iu whichever figure it is expressed ; since, as we 
have already seen, the premisses of a syllogism in the 
second, third, or fourth figure, and those of the syllo- 
gism in the first figure to which it may be reduced, 
are the same premisses, in everything except language, 
or, at least, as much of them as contributes to the 
proof of the conclusion is the same. We are there- 
fore at Uberty, in conformity with the general opinion 
of logicians, to consider the two elementary forms of 
the first figure as the universal types of all correct 
ratiocination ; the one, when the conclusion to be 
proved is affirmative, the other, when it is negative ; 
even though certain arguments may have a tendency 
to clothe themselves in the forms of the second, third, 
and fourth figures ; which, however, cannot possibly 
happen with the only class of arguments which are of 
first-rate scientific importance, those in which the 
conclusion is an universal affirmative, such conclu- 
sions being susceptible of proof in the first figure 
alone. 

§ 2. On examining, then, these two general 
formulae, we find that in both of them one premiss, 
the major, is an universal proposition ; and according 



exemplo for the third, and dictum de reciproco for the fourth. See 
part 1. or Dianoiologie^ chap. iv. § 229 et $eqq. 

Were it not that the views I am about to propound on the 
functions and ultimate foundation of the syllogism render such 
distinctions as these of very subordinate importance, I should have 
availed myself largely of this and other speculations of Lambert ; 
who has displayed, within the limits of the received theory of the 
syllogism, an originality for which it was scarcely to be supposed 
that there could still have been room on so exhausted a subject, 
and whose book may be strongly recommended to those who may 
attempt still further to improve the excellent manuals we already 
possess of this elementary portion of the Art of Reasoning.

as this is affirmative or negative, the conclusion is so 
too. All ratiocination, therefore, starts from a general 
proposition, principle, or assumption : a proposition 
in which a predicate is affirmed or denied of an entire 
class; that is, in which some attribute, or the nega- 
tion of some attribute, is asserted of an indefinite 
nimiber of objects, distinguished by a common charac- 
teristic, and designated, in consequence, by a common 
name. 

The other premiss is always affirmative, and 
asserts that something (which may be either an indi- 
vidual, a class, or part of a class,) belongs to, or is 
included in, the class, respecting which something 
was affirmed or denied in the major premiss. It 
follows that the attribute affirmed or denied of the 
entire class may (if there was truth in that affirmation 
or denial) be affirmed or denied of the object or 
objects alleged to be included in the class : and this 
is precisely the assertion made in the conclusion. 

Whether or not the foregoing is an adequate 
account of the constituent parts of the syllogism, will 
be presently considered ; but as far as it goes it is a 
true account. It has accordingly been generalized 
and erected into a logical maxim, on which all ratio- 
cination is said to be founded, insomuch that to 
reason and to apply the maxim are supposed to be 
one and the same thing. The maxim is. That what- 
ever can be affirmed (or denied) of a class, may be 
affirmed (or denied) of everything included in the 
class. This axiom, supposed to be the basis of the 
syllogistic theory, is termed by logicians the dictum 
de omni et nullo. 

This maxim, however, when considered as a prin- 
ciple of reasoning, appears suited to a system of meta- 
physics once indeed generally received, but which for

the last two centuries has been considered as finally 
abandoned, though there have not been wantmg, in 
our own day, attempts at its revival. So long as what 
were termed Universals were regarded as a peculiar 
kind of substances, having an objective existence 
distinct from the individual objects classed under 
them, the dictum de omni conveyed an important 
meaning ; because it expressed the intercommunity of 
nature, which it was necessary upon that theory that 
we should suppose to exist between those general 
substances and the particular substances which were 
subordinated to them. That everything predicable of 
the universal was predicable of the various individuals 
contained under it, was then no identical proposition, 
but a statement of what was conceived as a funda- 
mental law of the universe. The assertion that the 
entire nature and properties of the substantia secunda 
formed part of the properties of each of the individual 
substances called by the same name ; that the pro- 
perties of Man, for example, were properties of all 
men ; was a proposition of real significance when Man 
did not mean all men, but something inherent in men, 
and vastly superior to them in dignity. Now, how- 
ever, when it is known that a class, an universal, a 
genus or species, is not an entity per se, but neither 
more nor less than the individual substances them- 
selves which are placed in the class, and that there is 
nothing real in the matter except those objects, a 
common name given to them, and common attributes 
indicated by the name; what, I should be glad to 
know, do we learn by being told, that whatever can 
be affirmed of a class, may be affirmed of every object 
contained in the class ? The class is nothing but the 
objects contained in it : and the dictum de omni merely 
amounts to the identical proposition, that whatever is 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



236 REASONING. 

true of certain objects, is true of each of those objects. 
If all ratiocination were no more than the application 
of this maxim to particular cases, the syllogism would 
indeed be, what it has so often been declared to be, 
solemn trifling. The dictum de omni is on a par with 
another truth, which in its time was also reckoned of 
great importance, ** Whatever is, is ;" and not to be 
compared in point of significance to the cognate 
aphorism, '* It is impossible for the same thing to be 
and not to be ;'* since this is, at the lowest, equivalent 
to the logical axiom that contradictory propositions 
cannot both be true. To give any real meaning to 
the dictum de omni, we must consider it not as an 
axiom but as a definition ; we must look upon it as 
intended to explain, in a circuitous and paraphrastic 
manner, the meaning of the word class. 

An error which seemed finally refuted and dis- 
lodged from science, often needs only put on a new 
suit of phrases, to be welcomed back to its old 
quarters, and allowed to repose unquestioned for 
another cycle of ages. Modem philosophers have not 
been sparing in their contempt for the scholastic 
dogma that genera and species are a pecuUar kind of 
substances, which general substances being the only 
permanent things, while the individual substances 
comprehended under them are in a perpetual flux, 
knowledge, which necessarily imports stability, can 
only have relation to those general substances or 
universals, and not to the facts or particulars included 
under them. Yet, though nominally rejected, this 
very doctrine, whether disguised under the Abstract 
Ideas of Locke (whose speculations, however, it has 
less vitiated than those of perhaps any other writer 
who has been infected with it), under the ultra-nomi- 
nalism of Hobbes and Condillac, or the ontology of

RATIOCINATION, OR SYLLOGISM. 237 

the later Kantians, has never ceased to poison philo- 
sophy. Once accustomed to consider scientific inves- 
tigation as essentially consisting in the study of 
universals, men did not drop this habit of thought 
when they ceased to regard universals as possessing 
an independent existence : and even those who went 
the length of considering them as mere names, could 
not free themselves from the notion that the investi- 
gation of truth consisted entirely or partly in some 
kind of conjuration or juggle with those names. When 
a philosopher adopted fully the Nominalist view of 
the signification of general language, retaining along 
with it the dictum de omni as the foundation of all 
reasoning, two such premisses fairly put together were 
likely, if he was a consistent thinker, to land him in 
rather startling conclusions. Accordingly it has been 
seriously held, by writers of deserved celebrity, that 
the process of arriving at new truths by reasoning 
consists in the mere substitution of one set of arbi- 
trary signs for another ; a doctrine which they sup- 
posed to derive irresistible confirmation from the 
example of algebra. If there were any process in 
sorcery or necromancy more preternatural than this, 
I should be much surprised. The culminating point 
of this philosophy is the noted aphorism of Condillac, 
that a science is nothing, or scarcely anjrthing, but 
une langue bien faite : in other words, that the one 
sufficient rule for discovering the nature and proper- 
ties of objects is to name them properly : as if the 
reverse were not the truth, that it is impossible to 
name them properly except in proportion as we are 
already acquainted with their nature and properties. 
Can it be necessary to say, that none, not even the 
most trivial knowledge with respect to Things, ever

238 REASONING. 

was or could be originally got at by any conceivable 
manipulation of mere names ; and that what can be 
learnt from names, is only what somebody who used 
the names, knew before ? Philosophical analysis con- 
firms the indication of common sense, that the function 
of names is but that of enabling us to remember and to 
communicate our thoughts. That they also strengthen, 
even to an incalculable extent, the power of thought 
itself, is most true : but they do this by no intrinsic 
and peculiar virtue ; they do it by the power inherent 
in an artificial memory, an instrument of which few 
have adequately considered the immense potency. 
As an artificial memory, language truly is, what it 
has so often been called, an instrument of thought : 
but it is one thing to be the instrument, and another 
to be the exclusive subject upon which the instrument 
is exercised. We think, indeed, to a considerable 
extent, by means of names, but what we think of, are 
the things called by those names ; and there cannot 
be a greater error 'than to imagine that thought can 
be carried on with nothing in our mind but names, 
or that we can make the names think for us. 

§ 3. Those who considered the dictum de omni as 
the foundation of the syllogism, looked upon argu- 
ments in a manner corresponding to the erroneous 
view which Hobbes took of propositions. Because 
there are some propositions which are merely verbal, 
Hobbes, in order (apparently) that his definition 
might be rigorously universal, defined a proposition 
as if no propositions declared anything except the 
meaning of words. If Hobbes was right; if no 
further account than this could be given of the import 
of propositions; no theory could be given but the

commonly received one, of the combination of propo- 
sitions in a syllogism. If the minor premiss asserted 
nothing more than that something belongs to a class, 
and if, as consistency would require us to suppose, 
the major premiss asserted nothing of that class 
except that it is included in another class, the conclu- 
sion would only be, that what was included in the 
lower class is included in the higher, and the result, 
therefore, nothing except that the classification is 
consistent with itself. But we have seen that it is no 
sufficient account of the meaning of a proposition, to 
say that it refers something to, or excludes something 
from, a class. Every proposition which conveys real 
information asserts a matter of fact, dependent upon 
the laws of nature and not upon artificial classifica- 
tion. It asserts that a given object does or does not 
possess a given attribute ; or it asserts that two attri- 
butes, or sets of attributes, do or do not (constantly 
or occasionally) coexist. Since such is the purport of 
all propositions which convey any real knowledge, 
and since ratiocination is a mode of acquiring real 
knowledge, any theory of ratiocination which does not 
recognize this import of propositions, cannot, we may 
be sure, be the true one. 

Applying this view of propositions to the two 
premisses of a syllogism, we obtain the following 
results. The major premiss, which, as already 
remarked, is always universal, asserts, that all things 
which have a certain attribute (or attributes) have or 
have not along with it, a certain other attribute (or 
attributes). The minor premiss asserts that the 
thing or set of things which are the subject of that 
premiss, have the first-mentioned attribute ; and the 
conclusion is, that they have (or that they have not) 
the second. Thus in our former example, 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



S40 REASONING. 

All men are mortal, 

Socrates is a man, 
therefore 

Socrates is mortal, 
the subject and predicate of the major premiss are 
connotative terms, denoting objects and connoting 
attributes. The assertion in the major premiss is, 
that along with one of the two sets of attributes, we 
always find the other : that the attributes connoted by 
'• man" never exist unless conjoined with the attri- 
bute called mortality. The assertion in the minor 
premiss is that the individual named Socrates pos- 
sesses the former attributes ; and it is concluded that 
he possesses also the attribute mortality. Or if both 
the premisses are general propositions, as 

All men are mortal. 

All kings are men, 
therefore 

All kings are mortal, 
the minor premiss asserts that the attributes denoted 
by kingship only exist in conjimction with those 
signified by the word man. The major asserts as 
before, that the last-mentioned attributes are never 
found without the attribute of mortality. The con- 
clusion is, that wherever the attributes of kingship are 
found, that of mortality is found also. 

If the major premiss were negative, as. No men 
are gods, it would assert, not that the attributes con- 
noted by "Man" never exist without, but that they 
never exist with, those connoted by **God:" from 
which, together with the minor premiss, it is con- 
cluded, that the same incompatibility exists between 
the attributes constituting a god and those constituting 
a king. In a similar manner we might analyze any 
other example of the syllogism.

RATIOCINATION^ OR SYLLOGISM. 241 

If we generalize this process, and look out for the 
principle or law involved in every such inference, and 
presupposed in every syllogism the propositions of 
which are anything more than merely verbal; we 
find, not the unmeaning dictum de omni et nullo, but 
a fundamental principle, or rather two principles, 
strikingly resembling the axioms of mathematics. 
The first, which is the principle of affirmative syllo- 
gisms, is, that things which coexist with the same 
thing, coexist with one another. The second is the 
principle of negative syllogisms, and is to this effect : 
that a thing which coexists with another thing, with 
which other a third thing does not coexist, is not coex- 
istent with that third thing. These axioms mani- 
festly relate to facts, and not to conventions : and one 
or other of them is the ground, of the legitimacy of 
every argument in which facts and not conventions 
are the matter treated of. 

^ 4. It only remains to translate this exposition of 
the syllogism from the one into the other of the two 
languages in which we formerly remarked * that all 
propositions, and of course therefore all combinations 
of propositions, might be expressed. We observed 
that a proposition might be considered in two different 
lights ; as a portion of our knowledge of nature, or as 
a memorandum for our guidance. Under the former, 
or speculative aspect, an affirmative general proposi- 
tion is an assertion of a speculative truth, viz., that 
whatever has a certain attribute has a certain other 
attribute. Under the other aspect, it is to be re- 
garded not as a part of our knowledge, but as an aid 
for our practical exigencies, by enabling us when we

see or learn that an object possesses one of the two 
attributes, to infer that it possesses the other ; thus 
employing the first attribute as a mark or evidence of 
the second. Thus regarded, every syllogism comes 
within the following general formula : — 

Attribute A is a mark of attribute B, 
A given object has the mark A, 

therefore 
The given object has the attribute B. 

Referred to this type, the arguments which we 
have lately cited as specimens of the syllogism, will 
express themselves in the following manner : — 

The attributes of man are a mark of the attribute 
mortality, 
Socrates has the attributes of man, 

therefore 
Socrates has the attribute niortaUty. 

And again, 

The attributes of man are a mark of the attribute 

mortality, 
The attributes of a king are a mark of the attri- 
butes of man, 
therefore 
The attributes of a king are a mark of the attri- 
bute mortality. 
And lastly. 

The attributes of man are a mark of the absence 

of the attributes of a god. 
The attributes of a king are a mark of the attri- 
butes of man, 
therefore 
The attributes of a king are a mark of the absence of 
the attributes signified by the word god : 
(or, are evidence of the absence of those attributes).

To correspond with this alteration in the form of 
the syllogisms, the axioms on which the syllogistic 
process is founded must undergo a corresponding 
transformation. In this altered phraseology, both 
those axioms may be brought \mder one general 
expression; namely, that whatever possesses any 
mark, possesses that which it is a mark of. Or, 
when the minor premiss as well as the major is 
universal, we may state it thus : whatever is a mark 
of any mark, is a mark of that which this last is a 
mark of. To trace the identity of these axioms with 
those previously laid down, may be safely left to the 
intelligent reader. We shall find, as we proceed, the 
great convenience of the phraseology into which we 
have last thrown them, and which is better adapted 
than any I am acquainted with, to express with pre- 
cision and force what is aimed at, and actually 
accomplished, in every case of the ascertainment of a 
truth by ratiocination.

Chapter III. 

OF THE FUNCTIONS, AND LOGICAL VALUE, 
OF THE SYLLOGISM. 

§ 1 . We have shown what is the real nature of 
the truths with which the Syllogism is conversant, 
in contradistinction to the more superficial manner 
in which their import is conceived in the common 
theory; and what are the fundamental axioms on 
which its probative force or conclusiveness depends. 
We have now to inquire, whether the syllogistic 
process, that of reasoning from generals to particu- 
lars, is, or is not, a process of inference; a progress 
from the known to the unknown ; a means of coming 
to a knowledge of something which we did not know 
before. 

Logicians have been remarkably unanimous in 
their mode of answering this question. It is univer- 
sally allowed that a syllogism is vicious if there be 
anything more in the conclusion than was assumed in 
the premisses. But this is, in fact, to say, that 
nothing ever was, or can be, proved by syllogism, 
which was not known, or assumed to be known, 
before. Is ratiocination, then, not a process of infer- 
ence? And is the syllogism, to which the word 
reasoning has so often been represented to be exclu- 
sively appropriate, not really entitled to be called 
reasoning at all? This seems an inevitable conse- 
quence of the doctrine, admitted by all writers on the 
subject, that a syllogism can prove no more than is 
involved in the premisses. Yet the acknowledgment 



Digitized

FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OF THE SYLLOGISM. 245 

SO explicitly made, has not prevented one set of 
writers from continuing to represent the syllogism 
as the correct analysis of what the mind actually 
performs in discovering and proving the larger half of 
the truths, whether of science or of daily life, which 
we believe ; while those who have avoided this incon- 
sistency, and followed out the general theorem 
respecting the logical value of the syllogism to its 
legitimate corollary, have been led to impute useless- 
ness and frivolity to the syllogistic theory itself, on 
the ground of the petitio prindpii which they allege 
to be inherent in every syllogism. As I beheve both 
these opinions to be fundamentally erroneous, I must 
request the attention of the reader to certain consi- 
derations, without which any just appreciation of the 
true character of the syllogism, and the functions it 
performs in philosophy, appears to me impossible; 
but which seem to have been either overlooked, or 
insufficiently adverted to, both by the defenders of 
the syllogistic theory and by its assailants. 

§ 2. It must be granted that in every syllogism, 
considered as an argument to prove the conclusion, 
there is a petitio prindpii. When we say, 

All men are mortal 
Socrates is a man 

therefore 
Socrates is mortal ; 

it is unanswerably urged by the adversaries of the 
syllogistic theory, that the proposition, Socrates is 
mortal, is presupposed in the more general assump- 
tion. All men are mortal : that we cannot be assured 
of the mortality of all men, unless we were previously 
certain of the mortality of every individual man : that

246 REASONING. 

if it be still doubtful whether Socrates, or any other 
individual you choose to name, be mortal or not, the 
same degree of uncertainty must hang over the asser- 
tion, All men are mortal: that the general principle, 
instead of being given as evidence of the particular 
case, cannot itself be taken for true without exception, 
until every shadow of doubt which could affect any 
case comprised with it, is dispelled by evidence 
aliunde; and then what remains for the syllogism to 
prove ? that, in short, no reasoning from generals to 
particulars can, as such, prove anything : since from a 
general principle you cannot infer any particulars, 
but those which the principle itself assumes as fore- 
known. 

This doctrine is irrefragable; and if logicians, 
though unable to dispute it, have usually exhibited a 
strong disposition to explain it away, this was not 
because they could discover any flaw in the argu- 
ment itself, but because the contrary opinion seemed 
to rest upon arguments equally indisputable. In the 
syllogism last referred to, for example, or in any of 
those which we previously constructed, is it not 
evident that the conclusion may, to the person to 
whom the syllogism is presented, be actually and bond 
fide a new truth? Is it not matter of daily experience 
that truths previously undreamt of, facts which have 
not been, and cannot be, directly observed, are 
arrived at by way of general reasoning ? We believe 
that the Duke of Wellington is mortal. We do not 
know this by direct observation, since he is not yet 
dead. If we were asked how, this being the case, we 
know the duke to be mortal, we should probably 
answer, Because all men are so. Here, therefore, 
we arrive at the knowledge of a truth not (as yet) 
susceptible of observation, by a reasoning which 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OP THB SYLLOGISM. 247 

admits of being exhibited in the following syllo- 
gism: — 

All men are mortal 
The Duke of Wellington is a man 

therefore 
The Duke of Wellington is mortal. 

And since a large portion of our knowledge is thus 
acquired, logicians have persisted in representing the 
syllogism as a process of inference or proof; although 
none of them has cleared up the difficulty which 
arises from the inconsistency between that assertion 
and the principle, that if there be anything in the 
conclusion which was not already asserted in the 
premisses, the argument is vicious. For it is impos- 
sible to attach any serious scientific value to such a 
mere salvo, as the distinction drawn between being 
involved by implication in the premisses, and being 
directly asserted in them. When Archbishop Whately, 
for example, says*, that the object of reasoning is 
** merely to expand and unfold the assertions wrapt up, 
as it were, and implied in those with which we set 
out, and to bring a person to perceive and acknow- 
ledge the full force of that which he has admitted,'* 
he does not, I think, meet the real difficulty requiring 
to be explained, namely, how it happens that a science, 
like geometry, can be all " wrapt up " in a few defi- 
nitions and axioms. Nor does this defence of the 
syllogism difier much from what its assailants urge 
against it as an accusation, when they charge it with 
being of no use except to those who seek to press the 
consequences of an admission into which a man has 
been entrapped without having considered and under-

248 REASONING. 

stood its full force. When you admitted the major 
premiss, you asserted the conclusion ; but, says Arch- 
bishop Whately, you asserted it by implication merely: 
this, however, can here only mean that you asserted 
it unconsciously; that you did not know you were 
asserting it ; but, if so, the difficulty revives in this 
shape — Ought you not to have known? Were you 
warranted in asserting the general proposition without 
having satisfied yourself of the truth of everything 
which it fairly includes ? And if not, what then is 
the syllogistic art but a contrivance for catching you 
in a trap, and holding you fast in it ? 

§ 3. From this difficulty there appears to be but 
one issue. The proposition, that the Duke of Wel- 
lington is mortal, is evidently an inference ; it is got 
at as a conclusion from something else ; but do we, 
in reahty, conclude it from the proposition. All men 
are mortal? I answer, no. 

The error committed is, I conceive, that of over- 
looking the distinction between the two parts of the 
process of philosophizing, the inferring part, and the 
registering part; and ascribing to the latter the 
functions of the former. The mistake is that of 
referring a man to his own notes for the origin of his 
knowledge. If a man is asked a question, and is at 
the moment unable to answer it, he may refresh his 
memory by turning to a memorandum which he car- 
ries about with him. But if he were asked, how the 
fact came to his knowledge, he would scarcely answer, 
because it was set down in his note-book : unless the 
book was written, like the Koran, with a quill from 
the wing of the angel Gabriel. 

Assuming that the proposition. The Duke of 
Wellington is mortal, is immediately an inference

from the proposition. All men are mortal; whence do 
we derive our knowledge of that general truth ? No 
supernatural aid being supposed, the answer must be, 
by observation. Now, all which man can observe are 
individual cases. From these all general truths must 
be drawn, and into these they may be again resolved : 
for a general truth is but an aggregate of particular 
truths; a comprehensive expression, by which an 
indefinite number of individual facts are affirmed or 
denied at once. But a general proposition is not 
merely a compendious form for recording and pre- 
serving in the memory a number of particular facts, 
all of which have been observed. Generalisation is 
not a process of mere naming, it is also a process of 
inference. From instances which we have observed, 
we feel warranted in concluding, that what we found 
true in those instances, holds in all similar ones, past, 
present, and future, however numerous they may be. 
We then, by that valuable contrivance of language 
which enables us to speak of many as if they were 
one, record all that we have observed, together with 
all that we infer from our observations, in one concise 
expression; and have thus only one proposition, 
instead of an endless number, to remember or to 
communicate. The results of many observations and 
inferences, and instructions for making innumerable 
inferences in imforeseen cases, are compressed into 
one short sentence. 

When, therefore, we conclude from the death of 
John and Thomas, and every other person we ever 
heard of in whose case the experiment had been 
fairly tried, that the Duke of Wellington is mortal 
like the rest; we may, indeed, pass through the 
generalisation, All men are mortal, as an inter- 
mediate stage ; but it is not in the latter . half of the

process, the descent from all men to the Duke of 
Wellington, that the inference resides. The inference 
is finished when we have asserted that all m^i are 
mortal. What remains to be performed afterwards is 
merely deciphering our own notes. 

Archbishop Whately has contended that syllo- 
gising, or reasoning from generals to particulars, is 
not, agreeably to the vulgar idea, a peculiar mode of 
reasoning, but the philosophical analysis of the mode 
in which all men reason, and must do so if they 
reason at all. With the deference due to so high an 
authority, I cannot help thinking that the vulgar 
notion is, in this case, the more correct. If, from our 
experience of John, Thomas, &c., who once were 
living, but are now dead, we are entitled to conclude 
that all hiunan beings are mortal, we might surely 
without any logical inconsequence have concluded 
at once from those instances, that the Duke of Wel- 
lington is mortal. The mortality of John, Thomas, 
and company is, after all, the whole evidence we have 
for the mortality of the Duke of Wellington. Not 
one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a 
general proposition. Since the individual cases are 
all the evidence we can possess, evidence which no 
logical form into which we choose to throw it can 
make greater than it is ; and since that evidence is 
either sufficient in itself, or, if insufficient for one pur- 
pose, cannot be sufficient for the other ; I am unable 
to see why we should be forbidden to take the 
shortest cut from these sufficient premisses to the 
conclusion, and constrained to travel the '^ high priori 
road" by the arbitrary fiat of logicians. I cannot 
perceive why it should be impossible to journey from 
one place to another unless we *' march up a hill, and 
then march down again." It may be the safest road,

and there may be a resting place at the top of the hill, 
affording a commanding view of the surrounding 
country; but for the mere purpose of arriving at 
our journey's end, our taking that road is perfectly 
optional; it is a question of time, trouble, and 
danger. 

Not only may we reason from particulars to par- 
ticulars, without passing through generals, but we 
perpetually do so reason. All our earliest inferences 
are of this nature. From the first dawn of intelligence 
we draw inferences, but years elapse before we learn 
the use of general language. The child, who, having 
burnt his fingers, avoids to thrust them again into the 
fire, has reasoned or inferred, though he has never 
thought of the general maxim. Fire bums. He knows 
from memory that he has been burnt, and on this 
evidence believes, when he sees a candle, that if he 
puts his finger into the flame of it, he will be burnt 
again. He believes this in every case which happens 
to arise ; but without looking, in each instance, beyond 
the present case. He is not generalizing; he is infer- 
ring a particular from particulars. In the same way, 
also, brutes reason. There is Uttle or no ground for 
attributing to any of the lower animals the use of con- 
ventional signs, without which general propositions 
are impossible. But those animals profit by experi- 
ence, and avoid what they have found to cause them 
pain, in the same manner, though not always with the 
same skill, as a human creature. Not only thi<burnt 
child, but the burnt dog, dreads the fire. 

I believe that, in point of fact, when drawing 
inferences from our personal experience, and not from 
maxims handed down to us by books or tradition, we 
much oftener conclude from particulars to particulars 
directly, than through the intermediate agency of any

general proposition. We are constantly reasoning 
from ourselves to other people, or from one person to 
another, without giving ourselves the trouble to erect 
our observations into general maxims of human or 
external nature. When we conclude that some person 
will, on some given occasion, feel or act so and so^ 
we sometimes judge from an enlarged consideration of 
the manner in which men in general, or men of some 
particular character, are accustomed to feel and act; 
but much oftener from having known the fieelings and 
conduct of the same man in some previous instance, 
or from considering how we should feel or act our- 
selves. It is not only the village matron who, when 
called to a consultation upon the case of a neighbour's 
child, pronounces on the evil and its remedy simply 
on the recollection and authority of what she accounts 
the similar case of her Lucy. We all, where we have 
no definite maxims to steer by, guide ourselves in the 
same way ; and if we have an extensive experience, 
and retain its impressions strongly, we may acquire in 
this manner a very considerable power of accurate 
judgment, which we may be utterly incapable of 
justifying or of communicating to others. Among 
the higher order of practical intellects, there have been 
many of whom it was remarked how admirably they 
suited their means to their ends, without being able 
to give any sufficient reasons for what they did ; and 
applied, or seemed to apply, recondite principles which 
they w«re wholly unable to state. This is a natural 
consequence of having a mind sfored with appro- 
priate particulars, and having been long accustomed 
to reason at once from these to fresh particulars, 
without practising the habit of stating to oneself or 
to others the corresponding general propositions. An 
old warrior, on a rapid glance at the outlines of the

ground, is able at once to give the necessary orders 
for a skilful arrangement of his troops ; though if he 
has received little theoretical instruction, and has 
seldom been called upon to answer to other people 
for his conduct, he may never have had in his mind 
a single general theorem respecting the relation 
between ground and array. But his experience of 
encampments, under circumstances more or less 
similar, has left a nun;ber of vivid, unexpressed, un- 
generalized analogies in his mind, the most appro- 
priate of which, instantly suggesting itself, determines 
him to a judicious arrangement. 

The skill of an uneducated person in the use of 
weapons, or of tools, is of a precisely similar nature. 
The savage who executes unerringly the exact throw 
which brings down his game, or his enemy, in the 
manner most suited to his purpose, under the opera- 
tion of all the conditions necessarily involved, the 
weight and form of the weapon, the direction and 
distance of the object, the action of the wind, &c., 
owes this power to a long series of previous experi- 
ments, the results of which he certainly never framed 
into any verbal theorems or rules. It is the same in 
all extraordinary manual dexterity. Not long ago a 
Scotch manufacturer procured from England, at a 
high rate of wages, a working dyer, famous for pro- 
ducing very fine colours, with the view of teaching 
to his other workmen the same skill. The workman 
came ; but his mode of proportioning the ingredients, 
in which lay the secret of the effects he produced, was 
by taking them up in handfuls, while the common 
method was to weigh them. The manufacturer sought 
to make him turn his handling system into an equiva- 
lent weighing system, that the general principle of 
his peculiar mode of proceeding might be ascertained.

This, however, the man found himself quite unable to 
do, and therefore could impart his skill to nobody. 
ile had, from the individual cases of his own experi- 
ence, established a connexion in his mind between 
fine eSdctB of colour, and tactual perceptions in hand- 
ling his dyeing materials ; and from these perceptions 
he could, in any particular cases, infer the means to 
be employed, and the efiects which would be pro- 
duced, but could not put others in possession of the 
grounds on which he proceeded, from having never 
generalized them in his own mind, or expressed them 
in language. 

Almost every one knows Lord Mansfield's advice 
to a man of practical good sense, who, being appointed 
governor of a colony, had to preside in its court of 
justice, without previous judicial practice or legal 
education. The advice was, to give his decision boldly, 
for it would probably be right ; but never to venture 
on assigning reasons, for they would almost infallibly 
be wrong. In cases like this, which are of no 
uncommon occurrence, it would be absurd to suppose 
that the bad reason was the source of the good deci- 
sion. Lord Mansfield knew that if any reason were 
assigned it would be necessarily an afterthought, the 
judge being in fact guided by impressions from past 
experience, without the circuitous process of framing 
general principles from them, and that if he attempted 
to firame any such he would assuredly fail. Lord 
Mansfield, however, would not have doubted that a 
man of equal experience, who had also a mind stored 
with general propositions derived by legitimate induc- 
tion from that experience, would have been greatly 
preferable as a judge, to one, however sagacious, who 
could not be trusted with the explanation and justifi- 
cation of his own judgments. The cases of able men

performing wonderful things they know not how, are 
examples of the less civilized and most spontaneous 
form of the operations of superior minds. It is a 
defect in them, and often a source of errors, not to 
have generalized as they went on ; but generalization 
is a help, the most important indeed of all helps, yet 
not an essential. 

Even philosophers, who possess, in the form of 
general propositions, a systematic record of the results 
of the experience of mankind, need not always revert 
to those general propositions in order to apply that 
experience to a new casa It is justly remarked by 
Dugald Stewart, that though our reasonings in mathe- 
matics depend entirely upon the axioms, it is by no 
means necessary to our seeing the conclusiveness of 
the proof, that the axioms should be expressly adverted 
to. When it is inferred that A B is equal to C D 
because each of them is equal to E F, the most uncul- 
tivated understanding, as soon as the propositions 
were understood, would assent to the inference, with- 
out having ever heard of the general truth that 
^^ things which are equal to the same thing are equal 
to one another." This remark of Stewart, consistently 
followed out, goes to the root, as I conceive, of the 
philosophy of ratiocination ; and it is to be regretted 
that he tdmself stopt short at a much more limited 
application of it. He saw that the general proposi- 
tions on which a reasoning is said to depend, may, in 
certain cases, be altogether omitted, without impairing 
its probative force. But he imagined this to be a 
peculiarity belonging to axioms ; and argued from it, 
that axioms are not the foundations or first principles 
of geometry, from which aU the other truths of the 
science are synthetically deduced (as the laws of 
motion and of the composition of forces in mechanics.

the equal mobitity of fluids in hydrostatics, the laws 
of reflection and refraction in optics, are the first prin- 
ciples of those sciences) ; but are merely necessary 
assumptions, self-evident indeed, and the denial of 
which would annihilate all demonstration, but from 
which, as premisses, nothing can be demonstrated. In 
the present, as in many other instances, this thoughtful 
and elegant writer has perceived an important truth, 
but only by halves. Finding, in the case of geometrical 
axioms, that general names have not any talismanic 
virtue for conjuring new truths out of the pit of 
darkness, and not seeing that this is equally true in 
every other case of generalization, he contended that 
axioms are in their nature barren of consequences, and 
that the really fruitful truths, the real first principles 
of geometry, are the definitions ; that the definition, 
for example, of the circle is to the properties of the 
circle, what the laws of equilibrium and of the pressure 
of the atmosphere are to the rise of the mercury in 
the Torricellian tube. Yet all that he had asserted 
respecting the function to which the axioms are con- 
fined in the demonstrations of geometry, holds equally 
true of the definitions. Every demonstration in 
Euclid might be carried on without them. This is 
apparent from the ordinary process of proving a pro- 
position of geometry by means of a diagram. What 
assumption, in fact, do we set out from, to demonstrate 
by a diagram any of the properties of the circle? 
Not that in all circles the radii are equal, but only 
that they are so in the circle ABC. As our warrant 
for assuming this, we appeal, it is true, to the defini- 
tion of a circle in general ; but it is only necessary 
that you should grant the assumption in the case of 
the particular circle supposed. From this, which is 
not a general but a singular proposition, combined

with other propositions of a similar kind, some of 
which when generalized are called deiSnitions, and 
others axioms, we prove that a certain conclusion is 
true, not of all circles, but of the particular circle 
ABC; or at least would be so, if the facts precisely 
accorded with our assumptions. The enunciation, as 
it is called, that is, the general theorem which stands 
at the head of the demonstration, is not the propo- 
sition actually demonstrated. One instance only is 
demonstrated : but the process by which this is done^ 
is a process which, when we consider its nature, we 
perceive might be exactly copied in an indefinite 
number of other instances ; in every instance which 
conforms to certain conditions. The contrivance of 
general language furnishing us with terms which con- 
note these conditions, we are able to assert this 
indefinite multitude of truths in a single expression, 
and this expression is the general theorem. By 
dropping the use of diagrams, and substituting, in the 
demonstrations^ general phrases for the letters of the 
alphabet, we might prove the general theorem directly, 
that is, we might demonstrate all the cases at once ; 
and to do this we must, of course, employ as our 
premisses, the axioms and definitions in their general 
form. But this only means, that if we can prove an 
individual conclusion by assuming an individual fact, 
then in whatever case we are warranted in making an 
exactly similar assumption, we may draw an exactly 
similar conclusion. The definition is a sort of notice 
to ourselves and others, what assumptions we think 
ourselves entitled to make. And so in all cases, the 
general propositions, whether called definitions, 
axioms, or laws of nature, which we lay down at the 
beginning of our reasonings, are merely abridged 
statements in a kind of short hand, of the particular

258 REASONING. 

facts, which, as occasion arises, we either think we 
may proceed upon as proved, or intend to assume. 
In any one demonstration it is enough if we assume 
for a particular case, suitably selected, what by the 
statement of the definition or principle we announce 
that we intend to assume in all cases which may arise. 
The definition of the circle, therefore, is to one of 
Euclid's demonstrations, exactly what, according to 
Stewart, the axioms are ; that is, the demonstration 
does not depend upon it, but yet if we deny it the 
demonstration fails. The proof does not rest upon 
the general assumption, but upon a similar assump- 
tion confined to the particular case : that case, how- 
ever, being chosen as a specimen or paradigm of the 
whole class of cases included in the theorem, there 
can be no ground for making the assumption in that 
case which does not exist in every other ; and if you 
deny the assumption as a general truth, you deny the 
right to make it in the particular instance. 

There are, undoubtedly, the most ample reasons 
for stating both the principles and the theorems in 
their general form, and these will be explained pre- 
sently, so far as explanation is requisite. But, that 
an unpractised learner, even in making use of one 
theorem to demonstrate another, reasons rather from 
particular to particular than* from the general propo- 
sition, is manifest from the difficulty he finds in 
applying a theorem to a case in which the configura- 
tion of the diagram is extremely unlike that of the 
diagram by which the original theorem was demon- 
strated. A difficulty which, except in cases of unusual 
mental power, long practice can alone remove, and 
removes chiefly by rendering us familiar with all the 
configurations consistent with the general conditions 
of the theorem.

§ 4. From the considerations now adduced, the 
following conclusions seem to be established: All 
inference is from particulars to particulars : General 
propositions are merely registers of such inferences 
already made, and short formulae for making more ; 
The major premiss of a syllogism, consequently, is a 
formula of this description : and the conclusion is not 
an inference drawn ^rom the formula, but an inference 
drawn according to the formula: the real logical 
antecedent, or premisses, being the particular facts 
fit)m which the general proposition was collected by 
induction. Those facts, and the individual instances 
which supplied them, may have been forgotten ; but 
a record remains, not indeed descriptive of the facts 
themselves, but showing how those cases may be 
distinguished respecting which the facts, when 
known, were considered to warrant a given inference. 
According to the indications of this record, we draw 
our conclusion; which is, to all intents and purposes, 
a conclusion from the forgotten facts. For this it is 
essential that we should read the record correctly: 
and the rules of the syllc^m are a set of precautions 
to ensure our doing so. 

This view of the functions of the syllogism is 
confirmed by the consideration of precisely those 
cases which might be expected to be least favourable 
to it, namely, those in which ratiocination is inde*» 
pendent of any previous induction. We have already 
observed that the syllogism, in the ordinary course of 
our reasoning, is only the latter half of the process 
of travelling from premisses to a conclusion. There 
are, however, some peculiar cases in which it is the 
whole process. Particulars alone are capable of being 
subjected to observation ; and all knowledge which is 
derived from observation, begins, therefore, of neces^

sity, in particulars ; but our knowledge may, in cases 
of a certain description, be conceived as coming to us 
from other sources than observation. It may present 
itself as coming from revelation ; and the knowledge, 
thus supematurally communicated, may be conceived 
to comprise not only particular facts but general 
propositions, such as occur so abundantly in the 
writings of Solomon and in the apostolic epistles. Or 
the generalization may not be, in the ordinary sense^ 
an assertion at all, but a command ; a law, not in the 
philosophical, but in the moral and political sense of 
the term : an expression of the desire of a superior, 
that we, or any number of other persons, shall con* 
form our conduct to certain general instructions. So 
far as this asserts a fact, namely, a volition of the 
legislator, that fact is an individusJ fact, and the pro- 
position, therefore^ is not a general proposition. But 
the description therein contained of the conduct 
which it is the will of the legislator that his subjects 
should observe, is generaL The proposition asserts, 
not that all men are anything, but that aU men shall 
do something. These two cases, of a truth revealed 
in general terms^ and a command intimated in the 
like manner, might be exchanged for the more 
extensive cases, of any general statement received 
upon testimony, and any general practical precept. 
But the more limited illustrations suit us better, being 
drawn from subjects where long and complicated 
trains of ratiocination have actually been groimded 
upon premisses which came to manldnd from the first 
in a general form, the subjects of Scriptural Theology 
and of positive Law. 

In both these cases the generalities are given to 
us, and the particulars are elicited from them by a 
process which correctly resolves itself into a series of

FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OF THB SYLLOGISM. 261 

syllogisms. The real nature, however, of the sup- 
posed deductive process, is evident enough. It is a 
search for truth, no douht, but through the medium 
of an inquiry into the meaning of a form of words. 
The only point to be determined is, whether the 
authority which declared the general proposition, 
intended to include this case in it ; and whether the 
legislator intended his command to apply to the pre- 
sent case among others, or not. This is a question, 
as the Germans express it, of hermeneutics; it relates 
to the meaning of a certain form of discourse. The 
operation is not a process of inference, but a process 
of interpretation. 

In this last phrase we have obtained an expression 
which appears to me to characterize, more aptly than 
any other, the functions of the syllogism in all cases. 
When the premisses are given by authority, the 
function of Reasoning is to ascertain the testimony of 
a witness, or the will of a legislator, by interpreting 
the signs in which the one has intimated his assertion 
and the other his command. In like manner, when 
the premisses are derived from observation, the func- 
tion of Reasoning is to ascertain what we (or our 
predecessors) formerly thought might be inferred from 
the observed facts, and to do this by interpreting a 
memorandum of ours, or of theirs. The memorandum 
reminds us, that from evidence, more or less carefully 
weighed, it formerly appeared that a certain attribute 
might be inferred wherever we perceive a certain 
mark. The proposition. All men are mortal, (for 
instance,) shows that we have had experience from 
which we thought it followed that the attributes 
connoted by the term man, are a mark of mortality. 
But when we conclude that the Duke of Wellington 
is mortal, we do not infer this from the memorandum. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



262 REASONING. 

but from the former experience. All that we infer 
from the memorandum, is our own previous belief, 
(or that of those who transmitted to us the propo- 
sition,) concerning the inferences which that former 
experience would warrant. 

This view of the nature of the syllogism renders 
consistent and intelligible what otherwise remains 
obscure and confused in the theory of Archbishop 
Whately and other enlightened defenders of the syllo- 
gistic doctrine, respecting the limits to which its 
functions are confined. They all affirm, in as explicit 
terms as can be used, that the sole office of general 
reasoning is to prevent inconsistency in our opinions; 
to prevent us from assenting to anything, the truth of 
which would contradict something to which we had 
previously on good grounds given our assent. And 
they tell us, that the sole ground which a syllogism 
afibrds for assenting to the conclusion, is that the 
supposition of its being false, combined with the 
supposition that the premisses are true, would lead to 
a contradiction in terms. Now this would be but a 
lame account of the real grounds which we have for 
believing the facts which we learn from reasoning, in 
contradistinction to observation. The true reason 
why we believe that the Duke of Wellington will die, 
is that his fathers, and our fathers, and all other 
persons who were contemporary with them, have died. 
Those facts are the real premisses of the reasoning. 
But we are not led to infer the conclusion from those 
premisses, by the necessity of avoiding any verbal 
inconsistency. There is no contradiction in supposing 
that all those persons have died, and that the Duke 
of Wellington may, notwithstanding, live for ever. 
But there would be a contradiction if we first, on the 
ground of those same premisses, made a general

assertion including and covering the case of the Duke 
of Wellington, and then refused to stand to it in the 
individual case. There is an inconsistency to be 
avoided between the memorandum we make of the 
inferences which may be justly drawn in future cases, 
and the inferences we actually draw in those cases 
when they arise. With this view we interpret our 
own formula, precisely as a judge interprets a law : in 
order that we may avoid drawing any inferences not 
conformable to our former intention, as a judge avoids 
giving any decision not conformable to the legislator's 
intention. The rules for this interpretation are the 
rules of the syllogism: and its sole purpose is to 
maintain consistency between the conclusions we draw 
in every particular case, and the previous general 
directions for drawing them; whether those general 
directions were framed by ourselves as the result of 
induction, or were received by us from an authority 
competent to give them. 

^ 5. In the above observations it has, I think, 
been clearly shown, that, although there is always a 
process of reasoning or inference where a syllogism is 
used, the syllogism is not a correct analysis of that 
process of reasoning or inference; which is, on the 
contrary, (when not a mere inference from testimony,) 
an inference from particulars to particulars; autho- 
rised by a previous inference from particulars to 
generals, and substantially the same with it; of the 
nature, therefore, of Induction. But, while these 
conclusions appear to me undeniable, I must yet enter 
a protest, as strong as that of Archbishop Whately 
himself, against the doctrine that the syllogistic art is 
useless for the purposes of reasoning. The reasoning 
lies in the act of generalisation, not in interpreting the

264 REASONING. 

record of that act; but the syllogistic form is an 
indispensable collateral security for the correctness of 
the generalisation itself. 

It has already been seen, that if we have a collec- 
tion of particulars sufficient for grounding an induc- 
tion, we need not frame a general proposition; we 
may reason at once from those particulars to other 
particulars. But it is to be remarked withal, that 
whenever, from a set of particular cases, we can 
legitimately draw any inference, we may legitimately 
make our inference a general one. If, from observa- 
tion and experiment, we can conclude to one new 
case, so may we to an indefinite number. If that 
which has held true in our past experience will 
therefore hold in time to come, it will hold not 
merely in some individual case, but in all cases of a 
given description. Every induction, therefore, which 
suffices to prove one fact, proves an indefinite multi- 
tude of facts : the experience which justifies a single 
prediction must be such as will suffice to bear out a 
general theorem. This theorem it is extremely 
important to ascertain and declare, in its broadest 
form of generality; and thus to place before our 
minds, in its full extent, the whole of what our 
evidence must prove if it proves anything. 

This throwing of the whole body of possible 
inferences from a given set of particulars, into one 
general expression, operates as a security for their 
being just inferences in more ways than one. First, 
the general principle presents a larger object to the 
imagination than any of the singular propositions 
which it contains. A process of thought which leads 
to a comprehensive generality, is felt as of greater 
importance than one which terminates in an insulated 
fact; and the mind is, even unconsciously, led to

bestow greater attention upon the process, and to 
weigh more carefully the sufficiency of the experience 
appealed to, for supporting the inference grounded 
upon it. There is another, and a more important, 
advantage. In reasoning from a course of individual 
observations to some new and unobserved case^ which 
we are but imperfectly acquainted with (or we should 
not be inquiring into it), and in which, since we are 
inquiring into it, we probably feel a peculiar interest ; 
there is very little to prevent us from giving way to 
negligence, or to any bias which may affect our wishes 
or our^ imagination, and, under that influence, accept- 
ing insufficient evidence as sufficient But if, instead 
of concluding straight to the particular case, we place 
before ourselves an entire class of facts, — ^the whole < 
contents of a general proposition, every tittle of 
which is legitimately inferrible from our premisses, if . 
that one particular conclusion is so ; there is then a 
considerable likelihood that if the premisses are insuf- ' 
ficient, and the general inference, therefore, ground- 
less, it will comprise within it some fact or facts the • 
reverse of which we already know to be true ; and we 
shall thus discover the error in our generalisation, by 
what the schoolmen termed a reductio ad impossibile. ^ 

Thus if, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, a 
subject of the Roman empire, under the bias natu- 
rally given to the imagination and expectations by 
the lives and characters of the Antonines, had been 
disposed to conclude that Commodus would be a just 
ruler; 'supposing him to stop there, he might only 
have been undeceived by sad experience. But if he 
reflected that this conclusion could not be justifiable 
unless from the same evidence he was also warranted 
in concluding some general proposition, as, for 
instance, that all Roman emperors are just rulers ; he 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



266 REASONING. . 

would immediately have thought of Nero, Domitiao, 
and other instances, which, showing the falsity of the 
general conclusion, and therefore the insufficiency 
of the premisses, would have warned him that those 
premisses could not prove in the instance of Com- 
modus, what they were inadequate to prove in any 
collection of cases in which his was included. 

The advantage, in judging whether any contro- 
verted inference is legitimate, of referring to a parallel 
case, is universally acknowledged. But by ascending 
to the general proposition, we bring imder our view 
not one parallel case only, but all possible ][forallel 
cases at once; all cases to which the same set of 
evidentiary considerations are applicable. 

When, therefore, we argue from a number of 
known cases to another case supposed to be analo- 
gous, it is always possible, and generally advanta- 
geous, to divert our argument into the circuitous 
channel of an induction from those known cases to a 
genertd proposition, and a subsequent application of 
that general propoeition to the imknown case. This 
second part of the operatimi, which, as before 
observed, is essentially a process of interpretation, 
will be resolvable into a syllogism or a series of 
syllogisms, the majors of which will be general pro- 
positions embracing whole classes of cases ; every one 
of which propositions must be true in all its extent, 
if our argument is maintainable. If, therefore, any 
fact fairly coming within the range of one of these 
general propositions, and consequently asserted by it, 
is known or suspected to be other than the propo- 
sition asserts it to be, this mode of stating the argu- 
ment causes us to know or to suspect that the 
original observations, which are the real grounds of 
our conclusion, are not sufficient to support it. And 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OF THE SYLLOGISM. 267 

in proportion to the greater chance of our detecting 
the inconclusiveness of our evidence, will be the 
increased reliance we are entitled to place in it if no 
such evidence of defect shall appear. 

The value, therefore, of the syllogistic form, and i 
of Ibe rules for using it correctly, does not consist in 
their being the form and the rules according to which . 
our reasonings are necessarily, or even usually, made ; 
but in their furnishing us with a mode in which those 
reasonings may always be represented, and which is . 
admirably calculated, if they are inconclusive, to 
bring tHeir inconclusiveness to light. An induction 
from particulars to generals, followed by a syllogistic \ 
process from those generals to other particuhuns, is a 
form in which we may always state our reasonings if 
we please. It is not a form in which we must reason, 
but it is a form in which we may reason, and into 
which it is indispensable to throw our reasoning, when ' 
there is any doubt of its validity: though when the 
case is familiar and little complicated, and there is no ( 
suspicion of error, we may, and do, reason at once 
from the known particular cases to unknown ones. 

These are the uses of the syllogism, as a mode of 
verifying any given argument. Its ulterior uses, as 
respects the general course of our intellectual opera- 
tions, hardly require illustration, being in fact the 
acknowledged uses of general language. They amount 
substantially to this, that the inductions may be made 
once for all : a single careful interrogation of expe- 
rience may suffice, and the result may be registered in 
the form of a general proposition, which is committed 
to memory or to writing, and from which afterwards 
we have only to syllogize. The particulars of our 
experiments may then be dismissed from the memory, 
in which it would be impossible to retain so great

268 REASONING. 

a multitude of details ; while the knowledge which 
those details afforded for future use, and which would 
otherwise be lost as soon as the observations were 
forgotten, or as their record became too bulky for 
reference, is retained in a commodious and imme- 
diately available shape by means of general language. 

Against this advantage is to be set the coimter- 
vailing inconvenience, that inferences originally made 
on insufficient evidence, become consecrated, and, as it 
were, hardened into general maxuns ; and the mind 
cleaves to them from habit, after it has outgrown 
any liability to be misled by similar fallacious' appear- 
ances if they were now for the first time presented ; 
but having forgotten the particulars, it does not think 
of revising its own former decision. An inevitable 
drawback, which, however considerable in itself, forms 
evidently but a trifling deduction from the immense 
advantages of general language. 

The use of the syllogism is in truth no other than 
the use of general propositions in reasoning. We 
can reason without them ; in simple and obvious cases 
we habitually do so ; minds of great sagacity can do it 
in cases not simple and obvious, provided their expe- 
rience supplies them with instances essentially similar 
to every combination of circumstances likely to arise. 
But other men, or the same men when without the 
same preeminent advantages of personal experience, 
are quite helpless without the aid of general proposi- 
tions, wherever the case presents the smallest compli- 
cation ; and if we made no general propositions, few 
of us would get much beyond those simple inferences 
which are drawn by the more intelligent of the brutes. 
Though not necessary to reasoning, general propositions 
are necessary to any considerable progress in reasoning. 
It is, therefore, natural and indispensable to separate the

FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OF THE SYLLOGISM. 269 

process of investigation into two parts ; and obtain 
general formulae for determining what inferences may 
be drawn, before the occasion arises for drawing the 
inferences. The work of drawing them is then that 
of applying the formulae ; and the rules of the syllo- 
gism are a system of securities for the correctness of 
the application* 

$ 6. To complete the series of considerations con- 
nected with the philosophical character of the syllo- ] 
gism, it is requisite to consider, since the syllogism is 
not the universal type of the reasoning process, what 
is the real type. This resolves itself into the ques- \ 
tion, what is the nature of the minor premiss, and in 
what manner it contributes to establish the conclu* 
sion : for as to the major, we now fully understand, \ 
that the place which it nominally occupies in our 
reasonings, properly belongs to the individual facts or 
observations of which it expresses the general result; ! 
the major itself being no real part of the argument, 
but an intermediate halting place for the mind, inter- 
posed by an artifice of language between the real' 
premisses and the conclusion, by way of a security, 
which it is in a most material degree, for the correct- 
ness of the process* The minor, however, being an ' 
indispensable part of the syllogistic expression of an 
argument, without doubt either is, or corresponds to, 
an equally indispensable part of the argument itself, 
and we have only to inquire what part. 

It is perhaps worth while to notice here a specu- 
lation of one of the philosophers to whom mental 
science is most indebted, but who, though a very 
penetrating, was a very hasty thinker, and whose 
want of due circumspection rendered him fully as 
remarkable for what he did not see, as for what he saw.

I allude to Dr^ Thomas Brown, whose theory of ratioci- 
nation is peculiar. He saw the petitio principii which 
is inherent in every syllogism, if we consider the 
major to be itself the evidence by which the conclusion 
is proved, instead of being, what in fact it is, an 
assertion of vthe existence of evidence sufficient to 
prove any conclusion of a given description. Seeing 
this, Dr. Brown not only failed to see the immense 
advantage, in point of security for correctness, which 
is gained by interposing this step between the real 
evidence and the conclusion; but he thought it 
incumbent upon him to strike out the major alto- 
gether from the reasoning process, without substituting 
anything else; and maintained that our reasonings 
consist only of the minor premiss and the conclusion, 
Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal : thus 
actually suppressing, as an unnecessary step in the 
argument, the appeal to former experience. The 
absurdity of this was disguised from him by the 
opinion he adopted, that reasoning is merely analyzing 
our own general notions, or abstract ideas ; and that 
the proposition, Socrates is mortal, is evolved from 
the proposition, Socrates is a man, simply by recog- 
nising the notion of mortality as already contained in 
the notion we form of a man. 

After the explanations so fully entered into on the 
subject of propositions, much further discussion cannot 
be necessary to make the radical error of this view of 
ratiocination apparent. If the word man connoted 
mortality ; if the meaning of *^ mortal" were involved 
in the meaning of man;" we might, undoubtedly, 
evolve the conclusion from the minor alone, because 
the minor would have distinctly asserted it. But if, 
as is in fact the case, the word man does not connote 
mortality, how does it appear that in the mind of

FUNCTIONS ANDVALUE OF THE SYLLOGISM. 271 

every person who admits Socrates to be a man, the 
idea of man must include the idea of mortality ? Dr. 
Brown could not help seeing this difficulty, and in 
order to avoid it, was led, contrary to his intention, 
to re-establish, under another name, that step in the 
argument which corresponds to the major, by affirming 
the necessity of previously perceiving the relation 
between the idea of man and the idea of mortal. If 
the reasoner has not previously perceived this rela- 
tion, he will not, says Dr. Brown, infer because 
Socrates is a man, that Socrates is mortal. But even 
this admission, though amounting to a surrender of 
the doctrine that an argument consists of the minor 
and the conclusion alone, will not save the remainder 
of Dr. Brown's theory. The failure of assent to the 
argument does not take place merely because the 
reasoner, for want of due analysis, does not perceive 
that his idea of man includes the idea of mortality ; it 
takes place, much more commonly, because in his 
mind that relation between the two ideas has never 
existed. And in truth it never does exist, except as 
the result of experience. Consenting, for the sake of 
the argument, to discuss the question upon a suppo- 
sition of which we have recognised the radical incor- 
rectness, namely, that the meaning of a proposition 
relates to the ideas of the things spoken of, and not 
to the things themselves ; and conceding for a mo* 
ment the existence of abstract ideas, I must yet 
observe, that the idea of man, as an universal idea, 
the common property of all rational creatures, cannot 
involve anything but what is strictly implied in the 
name. If any one includes in his own private idea of 
man^ as no doubt is almost always the case, some 
other attributes, such for instance as mortality, he 
does so only as the consequence of experience, after

272 REASONING. 

having satisfied himself that all men possess that 
attribute : so that whatever the idea contains, in any 
person's mind, beyond what is included in the con- 
ventional signification of the word, has been added to 
it as the result of assent to a proposition ; while Dr. 
Brown's theory requires us to suppose, on the con- 
trary, that assent to the proposition is produced by 
evolving, through an analytic process, this very ele- 
ment out of the idea. This theory, therefore, may 
be considered as sufficiently refuted, and the minor 
premiss must be regarded as totally insufficient to 
prove the conclusion, except with the assistance of 
the major, or of that which the major represents, 
namely, the various singular propositions expressive 
of the series of observations, of which the generaliza- 
tion called the major premiss is the result. 

In the argument, then, which proves that So- 
crates is mortal, one indispensable part of the premisses 
will be as follows : ** My father, and my father's 
father, A, B, C, and an indefinite number of other 
persons, were mortal ;'* which is only an expression 
in different words of the observed fact that they have 
died. This is the major premiss, divested of the 
petitio principiiy and cut down to as much as is really 
known by direct evidence. 

In order to connect this proposition with the con- 
clusion, Socrates is mortal, the additional link neces- 
sary is such a proposition as the following : '* Socrates 
resembles my father, and my father's father, and the 
other individuals specified.'* This proposition we 
assert when we say that Socrates is a man. By 
saying so we likewise assert in what respect he 
resembles them, namely, in the attributes connoted by 
the word man. And from this we conclude that he 
further resembles them in the attribute mortality.

FUNCTIONS AND VALUE OF THE SYLLOGISM. 273 

§ 7. We have thus obtained what we were seeking, 
an universal type of the reasoning process. We find 
it resolvable in all cases into the following elements : 
Certain individuals have a given attribute ; an indi- 
vidual or individuals resemble the former in certain 
other attributes ; therefore they resemble them also in 1 
the given attribute. ITiis type of ratiocination does 
not claim, like the syllogism, to be conclusive from the t 
mere form of the expression ; nor can it possibly be 
so. That one proposition does or does not assert the 
very fact which was already asserted in another, may 
appear from the form of the expression, that is, from 
a comparison of the language; but when the two * 
propositions assert facts which are bond fide difierent, 
whether the one fact proves the other or not can never 
appear from the language, but must depend upon 
other considerations. Whether, from the attributes in ' 
which Socrates resembles those men who have hereto- 
fore died, it is allowable to infer that he resembles 
them also in being mortal, is a question of Induction ; 
and is to be decided by the principles or canons which 
we shall hereafter recognise as tests of the correct 
performance of that great mental operation. 

Meanwhile, however, it is certain, as before re- 
marked, that if this inference can be drawn as to 
Socrates, it can be drawn as to all others who 
resemble the observed individuals in the same attri- 
butes in which he resembles them ; that is (to express 
the thing concisely), of all men. If, therefore, the 
argument be conclusive in the case of Socrates, we 
are at liberty, once for aU, to treat the possession of 
the attributes of man as a mark, or satisfactory evi- 
dence, of the attribute of mortality. This we do by 
laying down the universal proposition, All men are 
mortal, and interpreting this, as occasion arises, in 

VOL. I. T

274 REASONING. 

its application to Socrates and others. By this means 
we establish a very convenient division of the entire 
logical operation into two steps ; first, that of ascer- 
taining what attributes are marks of mortality ; and, 
secondly, whether any given individuals possess those 
marks. And it will generally be advisable, in our 
speculations on the reasoning process, to consider 
this double operation as in fact taking place, and all 
reasoning as carried on in the form into which it must 
necessarily be thrown to enable us to apply to it any 
test of its correct performance. 

Although, therefore^ all processes of thought in 
which the ultimate premisses are particulars, whether 
we conclude from particulars to a general formula, or 
from particulars to other particulars according to 
that formula, are equally Induction; we shall yet, 
conformably to usage, consider the name Induction as 
more peculiarly belonging to the process of establish- 
ing the general proposition ; and the remaining opera- 
tion, which is substantially that of interpreting the 
general proposition, we shall call by its usual name, 
Deduction. And we shall consider every process by 
which anything is inferred respecting an unobserved 
case, as consisting of an Induction followed by a 
Deduction ; because, although the process needs not 
necessarily be carried on in this form, it is always 
susceptible of the form, and must be thrown into it 
when assurance of scientific accuracy is needed and 
desired.

$ 1. In our analysis of the syllogism it appeared 
that the minor premiss always affirms a resemblance 
between a new case, and some cases previously known ; 
while the major premiss asserts something which, 
having been found true of those known cases, we con- 
sider ourselves warranted in holding true of any other 
case resembling the former in certain given parti- 
culars. 

If all ratiocinations resembled, as to the minor 
premiss, the examples which we exclusively employed 
in the preceding chapter ; if the resemblance, which 
that premiss asserts, were obvious to the senses, as 
in the proposition ** Socrates is a man," or were at 
once ascertainable by direct observation ; there would 
be no necessity for trains of reasoning, and Deductive 
or Ratiocinative Sciences would not exist. Trains of 
reasoning exist only for the sake of extending an 
induction, founded as all inductions must be upon 
observed cases, to other cases in which we not only 
cannot directly observe what is to be proved, but 
cannot directly observe even the mark which is to 
prove it. 

§ 2. Suppose the syllogism to be. All cows rumi- 
nate, the animal which is before me is a cow, there- 
fore it ruminates. The minor, if true at all, is 
obviously so : the only premiss the establishment of 
which requires any anterior process of inquiry, is the

276 REASONING. 

major; and provided the induction of which that 
premiss is the expression was correctly performed, 
the conclusion respecting the animal now present 
will be instantly drawn ; because as soon as she is 
compared with the formula, she will be identified as 
being included in it. But suppose the syllogism to 
be the following : — ^AU arsenic is poisonous, the sub- 
stance which is before me is arsenic, therefore it is 
poisonous. The truth of the minor may not here be 
obvious at first sight ; it may not be intuitively evi- 
dent, but may itself be known only by inference. It 
may be the conclusion of another argument, which, 
thrown into the syllogistic form, would stand thus : — 
Whatever forms a compound with hydrogen, which 
yields a black precipitate with nitrate of silver, is 
arsenic ; the substance before me conforms to this 
condition; therefore it is arsenic. To establish, 
therefore, the ultimate conclusion, The substance 
before me is poisonous, requires a process which, in 
order to be syllogistically expressed, stands in need 
of two syllogisms ; and we have a Train of Reasoning. 
When, however, we thus add syllogism to syllo- 
gism, we are really adding induction to induction. 
Two separate inductions must have taken place to 
render this chain of inference possible; inductions 
founded, probably, on diflferent sets of individual 
instances, but which converge in their results, so that 
the instance which is the subject of inquiry comes 
within the range of them both. The record of these 
inductions is contained in the majors of the two syllo- 
gisms. First, we, or others before us, have examined 
various objects which yielded under the given circum- 
stances the given precipitate, and found that they 
possessed the properties connoted by the word arsenic; 
they were metallic, volatile, their vapour had a smell

TRAINS OF REASONING. 277 

of garlic, and so forth. Next, we, or others before 
us, have examined various specimens which possessed 
this metallic and volatile character, whose vapour had 
this smell, &c., and have invariably found that they 
were poisonous. The first observation we judge that 
we may extend to all substances whatever which 
yield the precipitate : the second, to all metallic and 
volatile substances resembling those we examined; 
and consequently, not to those only which are seen to 
be such, but to those which are concluded to be such 
by the prior induction. The substance before us is 
only seen to come within one of these inductions ; but 
by means of this one, it is brought within the other. 
We are still, as before, concluding from particulars to 
particulars ; but we are now concluding from parti- 
culars observed, to other particulars which are not, 
as in the simple case, seen to resemble them in the 
material points, but inferred to do so, because resem- 
bling them in something else, which we have been led 
by quite a different set of instances to consider as a 
mark of the former resemblance. 

This first example of a train of reasoning is still 
extremely simple, the series consisting of only two 
syllogisms. The following is somewhat more com- 
plicated : — No government, which earnestly seeks the 
good of its subjects, is liable to revolution; the 
Prussian government earnestly seeks the good of its 
subjects, therefore it is not in danger of revolution. 
The major premiss in this argument we shall suppose 
not to be derived from considerations d priori, but to 
be a generalisation from history, which, whether 
correct or erroneous, must have been founded upon 
observation of governments concerning whose desire 
of the good of their subjects there was no doubt. It 
has been found, or thought to be found, that these 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



278 Reasoning. 

were not liable to revolution, and it has been deemed 
that those instances warranted an extension of the 
same predicate to any and every government which 
resembles them in the attribute of desiring earnestly 
the good of its subjects. But does the Prussian 
government thus resemble them? This may be 
debated pro and con by many arguments, and must, 
in any case, be proved by another induction ; for we 
cannot directly observe the sentiments and desires of 
the persons who conduct the government of that 
country. To prove the minor, therefore, we require 
an argument in this form : Everj' government which 
acts in a certain manner, desires the good of its 
subjects ; the Prussian government acts in that par- 
ticular manner, therefore it desires the good of its 
subjects. But is it true that the Prussian government 
acts in the manner supposed ? This minor also may 
require proof; still another induction, as thus: — 
What is asserted by many disinterested witnesses, 
must be believed to be true; that the Prussian 
government acts in this manner, is asserted by many 
disinterested witnesses, therefore it must be believed 
to be true. The argument hence consists of three 
steps. Having the evidence of our senses that the 
case of the Prussian government resembles a number 
of former cases, in the circumstance of having some- 
thing asserted respecting it by many disinterested 
witnesses, we infer, first, that, as in those former 
instances, so in this instance the assertion is true. 
Secondly, what was asserted of the Prussian govern- 
ment being that it acts in a particular manner, and 
other governments or persons having been observed 
to act in the same manner, the Prussian government 
is brought into known resemblance with those other 
governments or persons ; and since they were known 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



TRAINS OF REASONING. 279 

to desire the good of the people, we thereupon, by a 
second induction, infer that the Prussian government 
desires the good of the people. This brings that 
government into known resemblance with the other 
governments which were observed to escape revo- 
lution, and thence, by a third induction, we predict 
that the Prussian government will in like maimer 
escape. And thus we are enabled to reason from the 
well-intentioned governments which we historically 
know as having escaped revolution, to other govern- 
ments which, when we made the induction, we may 
have known nothing about: yet if the induction was 
good, and therefore applicable to all governments of 
which we know the intentions but do not know the 
fortunes, it must be no less applicable to those whose 
intentions we do not know, but can only infer, pro- 
vided this inference also rests upon a good induction. 
We are still reasoning from particulars to particulars, 
but we now reason to the new instance from three 
distinct sets of former instances : to one only of those 
sets of instances do we directly perceive the new one 
to be similar; but from that similarity we inductively 
infer that it has the attribute by which it is assimilated 
to the next set, and brought within the corresponding 
induction ; when by a repetition of the same operation 
we infer it to be similar to the third set, and hence a 
third induction conducts us to the ultimate conclusion. 

§ 3. Notwithstanding the superior complication 
of these examples, compared with those by which in 
the preceding chapter we illustrated the general theory 
of reasoning, every doctrine which we then laid down 
holds equally true in these more intricate cases. The 
successive general propositions are not steps in the 
reasoning, are not intermediate links in the chain of 

Digitized-by VjOOQiC 



280 REASONING. 

inference, between the particulars observed, and those 
to which we apply the observation. If we had suffi- 
ciently capacious memories, and a sufficient power of 
maintainmg order among a huge mass of details, the 
reasoning could go on without any general propositions ; 
they are mere formulae for inferring particulars from 
particulars. The principle of general reasoning is, (as 
before explained,) that if from observation of certain 
known particulars^ what was seen to be true of them 
can be inferred to be true of any others, it may be 
inferred of all others which are of a certain descrip- 
tion. And in order that we may never fail to draw 
this conclusion in a new case when it can be drawn 
correctly, and may avoid drawing it when it cannot, 
we determine once for all what are the distinguisluDg 
marks by which such cases may be recognised. The 
subsequent process is merely that of identifying an 
object, and ascertaining it to have those marks ; 
whether we identify it by the very marks themselves, 
or by others which we have ascertained (through 
another and a similar process) to be marks of those 
marks. The real inference is always from particulars 
to particulars, from the observed instances to an 
unobserved one: but in drawing this inference, we 
conform to a formula which we have adopted for our 
guidance in such operations, and which is a record of 
the criteria by which we thought we had ascertained 
that we might distinguish when the inference could 
and when it could not be drawn. The real premisses 
are the individual observations, even though they may 
have been forgotten, or, being the observations of 
others and not of ourselves, may, to us, never have 
been known : but we have before us proof that we or 
others once thought them sufficient for an induction, 
and we have marks to show whether any new case is

TRAINS OF REASONING. 281 

one of those to which, if then known, the induction 
would have been deemed to extend. These marks 
we either recognise at once, or by the aid of other 
marks, which by another previous induction we col- 
lected to be marks of them. Even these marks of 
marks may only be recognised through a third set 
of marks ; and we may have a train of reasoning, 
of any length, to bring a new case within the 
scope of an induction grounded on particulars its 
similarity to which is only ascertained in this indirect 
manner. 

Thus, in the argument concerning the Prussian 
government, the ultimate inductive inference was, 
that it was not liable to revolution : this inference was 
drawn according to a formula in which desire of the 
public good was set down as a mark of not being 
liable to revolution ; a mark of this mark was, acting 
in a particular manner ; and a mark of acting in that 
manner, was, being asserted to do so by many disin- 
terested witnesses: this mark, the Prussian govern- 
ment was recognised by the senses as possessing. 
Hence that government fell within the last induction, 
and by it was brought within all the others. The 
perceived resemblance of the case to one set of 
observed particular cases, brought it into known 
resemblance with another set, and that with a third. 

In the more complex branches of knowledge, the 
deductions seldom consist, as in the examples hitherto 
exhibited, of a single chain, a a mark of 6, 6 of c, c 
of rf, therefore a a mark of d. They consist (to carry 
on the same metaphor) of several chains united at the 
extremity, as thus: a a mark of rf, 6 of e, c of/, 
d efo( n, therefore a 6 c a mark of n. Suppose, for 
example, the following combination of circumstances: 
1st, rays of Ught impinging on a reflecting surface; 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



282 REASONING. 

2iid, that surface parabolic; 3rd, those rays parallel to 
each other and to the axis of the surface. It is to be 
proved that the concourse of these three circumstances 
is a mark that the reflected rays will pass through the 
focus of the parabolic surface. Now each of the 
three circumstances is singly a mark of something 
material to the case. Rays of light impinging on a 
reflecting surface, are a mark that those rays will be 
reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence. 
The parabolic form of the surface is a mark that, from 
any point of it, a line drawn to the focus and a line 
parallel to the axis will make equal angles with the 
surface. And finally, the parallelism of the rays to the 
axis is a mark that their angle of incidence coincides 
with one of these equal angles. The three marks 
taken together are therefore a mark of all these three 
things united. But the three united are evidently a 
mark that the angle of reflexion must coincide with 
the other of the two equal angles, that formed by a 
line drawn to the focus ; and this again, by the funda- 
mental axiom concerning straight lines, is a mark 
that the reflected rays pass through the focus. Most 
chains of physical deduction are of this more com- • 
pUcated type; and even in mathematics such are 
abundant, as in all propositions where the hypothesis 
includes numerous conditions : ** Tjf a circle be taken, 
and if within that circle a point be taken, not the 
centre, and if straight lines be drawn from that point 
to the circumference, then," &c. 

§ 4. The considerations now stated remove a 
serious difficulty from the view we have taken of 
reasoning ; which view might otherwise have seemed 
not easily reconcilable with the fact that there are 
Deductive or Ratiocinative Sciences. It might seem 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



TRAINS OF REASONING. 283 

to follow, if all reasoning be induction, that the diffi- 
culties of philosophical investigation must lie in the 
inductions exclusively, and that when these were easy, 
and susceptible of no doubt or hesitation, there could 
be no science, or, at leasts no difficulties in science. 
The existence, for example, of an extensive Science 
of Mathematics, requiring the highest scientific genius 
in those who contributed to its creation, and calling 
for a most continued and vigorous exertion of intellect 
in order to appropriate it when created, may seem 
hard to be accounted for on the foregoing theory. 
But the considerations more recently adduced remove 
the mystery, by showing, that even when the induc- 
tions themselves are obvious, there may be much 
difficulty in finding whether the particular case which 
is the subject of inquiry comes within them; and 
ample room for scientific ingenuity in so combining 
various inductions, as, by means of one within which 
the case evidently falls, to bring it within others in 
which it cannot be directly seen to be included. 

When the more obvious of the inductions which 
can be made in any science from direct observations, 
have been made, and general formulas have been 
framed, determining the limits within which these 
inductions are applicable ; as often as a new case can 
be at once seen to come within one of the formulas, 
the induction is applied to the new case, and the 
business is ended. But new cases are continually 
arising, which do not obviously come within any 
formula whereby the questions we want solved in 
respect of them could be answered. Let us take an 
instance from geometry ; and as it is taken only for 
illustration, let the reader concede to us for the 
present, what we shall endeavour to prove in the next 
chapter, that the first principles of geometry are 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



284 REASONING. 

results of induction. Our example shall be the fifth 
proposition of the first book of Euclid. The inquiry 
is, Are the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle 
equal or unequal ? The first thing to be considered 
is, what inductions we have, from which we can infer 
equality or inequality. For inferring equality we 
have the following formulae: — ^Things which being 
applied to each other coincide, are equals. Things 
which are equal to the same thing are equals. A 
whole and the sum of its parts are equals. The sums 
of equal things are equals. The differences of equal 
things are equals. There are no other formulae to 
prove equality. For inferring inequality we have the 
following : — ^A whole and its parts are unequals. The 
sums of equal things and unequal things are unequals. 
The differences of equal things and unequal things are 
unequals. In all, eight formulae. The angles at the 
base of an isosceles triangle do not obviously come 
within any of these. The formulae specify certain 
marks of equality and of inequality, but the angles 
cannot be perceived intuitively to have any of those 
marks. We can, however, examine whether they 
have properties which, in any other formulae, are set 
down as marks of those marks. On examination it 
appears that they have; and we ultimately suc- 
ceed in bringing them within this formula, " The 
differences of equal things are equal." Whence 
comes the difficulty in recognising these angles as 
the differences of equal things? Because each of 
them is the difference not of one pair only, but of 
innumerable pairs of angles ; and out of these we had 
to imagine and select two, which could either be 
intuitively perceived to be equals, or possessed some 
of the marks of equality set down in the various 
formulae. By an exercise of ingenuity, which, on the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



TRAINS OF REASONING. 285 

part of the first inventor, deserves to be regarded as 
considerable, two pairs of angles were hit upon, which 
united these requisites. First, it could be perceived 
intuitively that their difierences were the angles at 
the base; and, secondly, they possessed one of the 
marks of equality, namely, coincidence when applied 
to one another. This coincidence, however, was not 
perceived intuitively, but inferred, in conformity to 
another formula. 

To make all clear, we subjoin an analysis of 
the demonstration. Euclid, it will be remembered, 
demonstrates his fifth proposition by means of the 
fourth. This it is not allowable for us to do, because 
we are undertaking to trace deductive truths not to 
prior deductions, but to their original inductive foun- 
dation. We must therefore use the premisses of the 
fourth proposition instead of 
its conclusion, and prove 
the fifth directly from first 
principles. To do so re- 
quires six formulas. (We 
must begin, as in Euclid, by 
prolonging the equal sides 
A B, A C, to equal distances, 
and joining the extremities 
BE, DC.) 

First Formula. The sums of equals are equal. 

A D and A E are sums of equals by the supposi- 
tion. Having that mark of equality, they are con- 
cluded by this formula to be equal. 

Second Formula. Equal straight lines being applied 
to one another coincide. 
A C, A B, are within this formula by supposition ; 
AD, A E, have been brought within it by the pre- 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 




286 REASONING. 

ceding step. Both these pairs of straight lines have 
the property of equality; which, according to the 
second formula, is a mark that, if applied to each 
other, they will coincide. Coinciding altogether 
means coinciding in every part, and of course at their 
extremities, D E and B C. 

Third Formula. Straight lineSy having their extremi- 
ties coincident^ coincide. 

B E and D C have been brought within this for- 
mula by the preceding induction ; they will, therefore, 
coincide. 

Fourth Formula. Angles, having their sides coinci- 
denty coincide. 

The two previous inductions having shown that 
B E and D C coincide, and that A D, A E, coincide, 
the angles ABE and ACD are thereby brought 
within the fourth formula, and accordingly coincide. 

Fifth Formula. Things which coincide are equal. 

The angles ABE and A CD are brought within 
this formula by the induction immediately preceding. 
This train of reasoning being also applicable, mutatis 
mutandis J to the angles E B C, D C B, these also are 
brought within the fifth formula. And, finally, 

Sixth Formula. The differences of equals are equal. 

The angle ABC being the difference of ABE, 
C B E, and the angle A C B being the difference of 
A C B, D C B ; which have been proved to be equals ; 
ABC and ACB are brought within the last for- 
mula by the whole of the previous process. 

The difficulty here encountered is chiefly that of 
figuring to ourselves the two angles at the base of the 
triangle ABC, as remainders made by cutting one 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



TRAINS OK REASONING. 287 

pair of angles out of another, while each pair shall be 
corresponding angles of triangles which have two 
sides and the intervening angle equal. It is by this 
happy contrivance that so many different inductions 
are brought to bear upon the same particular case. 
And this not being at all an obvious idea, it may be 
seen from an example so near the threshold of mathe- 
matics, how much scope there may well be for scien- 
tific dexterity in the higher branches of that and other 
sciences, in order so to combine a few simple induc- 
tions, as to bring within each of them innumerable 
cases which are not obviously included in it; and how 
long, and numerous, and complicated may be the 
processes necessary for bringing the inductions toge- 
ther, even when each induction may itself be very 
easy and simple. All the inductions involved in all 
geometry are comprised in those simple ones, the 
formulae of which are the Axioms, and a few of the 
so-called Definitions. The remainder of the science 
is made up of the processes employed for bringing 
unforeseen cases within these inductions ; or (in syllo- 
gistic language) for proving the minors necessary to 
complete the syllogisms ; the majors being the defini- 
tions and axioms. In those definitions and axioms are 
laid down the whole of the marks, by an artful combi- 
nation of which men have been able to discover and 
prove all that is proved in geometry. The marks 
being so few, and the inductions which furnish them 
being so obvious and familiar; the connecting of several 
of them together, which constitutes Deductions, or 
Trains of Reasoning, forms the whole difficulty of the 
science, and, with a trifling exception, its whole bulk ; 
and hence Geometry is a Deductive Science. 

J 5. It will be seen hereafter that there are weighty 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



288 REASONING. 

scientific reasons for giving to every science as much 
of the character of a Deductive Science as possible ; 
for endeavouring to construct the science from the 
fewest and the simplest possible inductions, and to 
make these, by any combinations however compli- 
cated, suffice for proving even such truths, relating 
to complex cases, as could be proved, if we chose, by 
inductions from specific experience. Every branch 
of natural philosophy was originally experimental ; 
each generalization rested upon a special induction, 
and was derived from its own distinct set of observa- 
tions and experiments. From being sciences of pure 
experiment, as the phrase is, or, to speak more cor- 
rectly, sciences in which the reasonings consist of no 
more than one step, and are expressed by single syllo- 
gisms, all these sciences have become to some extent, 
and some of them in nearly the whole of their extent, 
sciences of pure reasoning; whereby multitudes of 
truths, already known by induction from as many 
different sets of experiments, have come to be exhi- 
bited as deductions or corollaries from inductive pro- 
positions of a simpler and more universal character. 
Thus mechanics, hydrostatics, optics, acoustics, and 
thermology, have successively been rendered mathe- 
matical; and astronomy was brought by Newton 
within the laws of general mechanics. Why it is that 
the substitution of this circuitous mode of proceed- 
ing for a process apparently much easier and more 
natural, is held, and justly, to be the greatest triumph 
of the investigation of nature, we are not, in this 
stage of our inquiry, prepared to examine. But it is 
necessary to remark, that although, by this progressive 
transformation, all sciences tend to become more and 
more Deductive, they are not therefore the less Induc- 
tive ; every step in the Deduction is still an Induction.

The opposition is not between the terms Deductive 
and Inductive, but between Deductive and Experi- 
mental. A science is Experimental, in proportion as 
every new case, which presents any peculiar features, 
stands in need of a new set of observations and expe- 
riments, a fresh induction. It is Deductive, in pro- 
portion as it can draw conclusions, respecting cases 
of a new kind, by processes which bring those cases 
under old inductions ; by ascertaining that cases which 
cannot be observed to have the requisite marks, have, 
however, marks of those marks. 

We can now, therefore, perceive what is the 
generic distinction between sciences which can be 
made Deductive, and those which must as yet remain 
Experimental. The difference consists in our having 
been able, or not yet able, to discover marks of marks. 
If by our various inductions we have been able to pro- 
ceed no further than to such propositions as these, a a 
mark of 6, or a and b marks of one another, c a mark 
of d, or c and d marks of one another, without any- 
thing to connect a or 6 with cor d; we have a science 
of detached and mutually independent generalizations, 
such as these, that acids redden vegetable blues, and 
that alkalis colour them green ;' from neither of which 
propositions could we, directly or indirectly, infer the 
other : and a science, so far as it is composed of such 
propositions, is purely experimental. Chemistry, in 
the present state of our knowledge, has not yet thrown 
off this character. There are other sciences, however, 
of which the propositions are of this kind : a a mark 
of 6, 6 a mark of c, c of d, d of e, &c. In these 
sciences we can mount the ladder from a to e by a 
process of ratiocination ; we can conclude that a is a 
mark of e, and that every object which has the mark 
a has the property e, although, perhaps, we never 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



290 REASONING. 

were able to observe a and e together, and although 
even c?, our only direct mark of e, may be not per- 
ceptible in those objects, but only inferrible. Or 
varying the first metaphor, we may be said to get 
from a to e underground : the marks 6, c, rf, which 
indicate the route, must all be possessed somewhere by 
the objects concerning which we are inquiring; but 
they are below the surface : a is the only mark that 
is visible, and by it we are able to trace in succession 
all the rest. 

^ 6. We can now understand how an experimental 
transforms itself into a deductive science by the mere 
progress of experiment. In an experimental science, 
the inductions, as we have said, lie detached, as, a a 
maij£ of 6, c a mark of d, e a mark of/, and so on : 
now, a new set of instances, and a consequent new 
induction, may at any time bridge over the interval 
between two of these unconnected arches ; 6, for 
example, may be ascertained to be a mark of c, which 
enables us thenceforth to prove deductively that a is a 
mark of c. Ot, as sometimes happens, some grand 
comprehensive induction may raise an arch high in 
the air, which bridges over hosts of them at once : 
6, rf,/, and all the rest, turning out to be marks of 
some one thing, or of things between which a con- 
nexion has already been traced. As when Newton 
discovered that the motions, whether regular or appa- 
rently anomalous, of all the bodies of the solar 
system, (each of which motions had been inferred by a 
separate logical operation, from separate marks,) were 
all marks of moving round a common centre, with a 
centripetal force varying directly as the mass and 
inversely as the square of the distance from that 
centre. This is the greatest example which has yet

TRAINS OF REASONING. 291 

occurred of the transformation, at one stroke, of a 
science which was still to a great degree merely expe- 
rimental, into a deductive science. 

Transformations of the same nature, but on a 
smaller scale, continually take place in the less ad- 
vanced branches of physical knowledge, without ena- 
bling them to throw off the character of experimental 
sciences. Thus with regard to the two unconnected 
propositions before cited, namely. Acids redden vege- 
table blues. Alkalis make them green ; it is remarked 
by Liebig, that all blue colouring matters which are 
reddened by acids (as well as, reciprocally, all red 
colouring matters which are rendered blue by alkalis) 
contain nitrogen : and it is quite possible to conceive 
that this circumstance may one day furnish a bond of 
connexion between the two propositions in question, 
by showing that the antagonist action of acids and 
alkalis in producing or destroying the colour blue, is 
the result of some one, more general, law. Although 
this connecting of detached generalizations is so much 
gain, it tends but little to give a deductive character 
to any science as a whole ; because the new courses 
of observation and experiment, which thus enable us 
to connect together a few g^ieral truths, usually 
make known to us a still greater number of uncon- 
nected new ones. Hence chemistry, though similar 
extensions and simplifications of its generalizations 
are continually taking place, is still in the main an 
experimental science; and is likely so to continue, 
unless some comprehensive induction should be here- 
after arrived at, which, like Newton's, shall connect a 
vast number of the smaller known inductions toge- 
ther, and change the whole method of the science at 
once. Chemistry has already one great generalization, 
which, though relating to one of the subordinate

aspects of chemical phenomena, possesses within its 
limited sphere this comprehensive character; the 
principle of Dalton, called the atomic theory, or the 
doctrine of chemical equivalents : which by enabUng 
us to a certain extent to foresee the proportions in 
which two substances will combine, before the experi- 
ment has been tried, constitutes undoubtedly a source 
of new chemical truths obtainable by deduction, as 
well as a connecting principle for all truths of the 
Bame description previously obtained by experiment. 

§ 7. The discoveries which change the method of 
a science from experimental to deductive, mostly con- 
sist in establishing, either by deduction or by direct 
experiment, that the varieties of a particular pheno- 
menon uniformly accompany the varieties of some 
other phenomenon better known. Thus the science 
of sound, which previously stood in the lowest rank 
of merely experimental science, became deductive 
when it was proved by experiment that every variety 
of sound was consequent upon, and therefore a mark 
of, a distinct and definable variety of oscillatory mo- 
tion among the particles of the transmitting medium. 
When this was ascertained, it followed that every 
relation of succession or coexistence which obtained 
between phenomena of the more known class,' 
obtained also between the phenomena which corre- 
sponded to them in the other class. Every sound, 
being a mark of a particular oscillatory motion, 
became a mark of everything which, by the laws of 
dynamics, was known to be inferrible from that 
motion ; and everything which by those same laws 
was a mark of any oscillatory motion, became a mark 
of the corresponding sound. And thus many truths, 
not before suspected, concerning sound, became dedu- 



Digitized 



by Google 



TRAINS OF REASONING. 293 

cible from the known laws of the propagation of motion 
through an elastic medium ; while facts already empi- 
rically known respecting sound, became an indication 
of corresponding properties of vibrating bodies, pre- 
viously xmdiscovered. 

But the grand agent for transforming experimental 
into deductive sciences, is the science of number. The 
properties of numbers, alone among all known phe- 
nomena, are, in the most rigorous sense, properties 
of all things whatever. All things are not coloured, 
or ponderable, or even extended ; but all things are 
numerable. And if we consider this science in its whole 
extent, from common arithmetic up to the calculus of 
variations, the truths already ascertained seem all but 
infinite, and admit of indefinite extension. 

These truths, although affirmable of all things 
whatever, of course apply to them only in respect of 
their quantity. But if it comes to be discovered that 
variations of quality in any class of phenomena, corre- 
spond regularly to variations of quantity either in 
those same or in some other phenomena; every formula 
of mathematics applicable to quantities which vary in 
that particular manner, becomes a mark of a corre- 
sponding general truth respecting the variations in 
quaUty which accompany them : and the science of 
* quantity being (as far as any science can be) altogether 
deductive, the theory of that particular kind of 
quaUties becomes, to this extent, deductive Ukewise. 

The most striking instance in point which history 
affords (though not an example of an experimental 
science rendered deductive, but of an unparalleled 
extension given to the deductive process in a science 
which was deductive already), is the revolution in 
geometry which originated with the illustrious Des- 
cartes, and was completed by Clairaut. These phi-

losophers remarked, that to every variety of position 
in points, direction in lines, or form in curves or 
surfaces, (all of which are Qualities,) there corre- 
sponds a peculiar relation of quantity between either 
two or three rectilineal co-ordinates ; insomuch that if 
the law were known according to which those co- 
ordinates vary relatively to one another, every other 
geometrical property of the line or surface in question, 
whether relating to quantity or quality, would be 
capable of being inferred. Hence it followed that every 
geometrical question could be solved, if the corre- 
sponding algebraical one could; and geometry received 
an accession (actual or potential) of new truths, cor- 
responding to every property of numbers which the 
progress of the calculus had brought, or might in 
future bring, to light. In the same general manner, 
mechanics, astronomy, and in a less degree, every 
branch of natural philosophy commonly so called, 
have been made algebraical. The varieties of physical 
phenomena with which those sciences are conversant, 
have been found to answer to determinable varieties 
in the quantity of some circumstance or other ; or at 
least to varieties of form or position, for which cor- 
responding equations of quantity had already been, or 
were susceptible of being, discovered by geometers. 

In these various transformations, the propositions 
of the science of number do but fulfil the function 
proper to all propositions forming a train of reasoning, 
viz., that of enabling us to arrive in an indirect 
method, by marks of marks, at such of the properties 
of objects as we cannot directly ascertain (or not so 
conveniently) by experiment. We travel from a given 
visible or tangible fact, through the truths of numbers, 
to the fact sought. The given fact is a mark that a 
certain relation subsists between the quantities of

some of the elements concerned; while the fact sought 
presupposes a certain relation between the quantities 
of some other elements : now, if these last quantities 
are dependent in some known manner upon the former, 
orviceversd^ we can argue from the numerical relation 
between the one set of quantities, to determine that 
which subsists between the other set ; the theorems 
of the calculus affording the intermediate links. And 
thus the one of the two physical facts becomes a mark 
of the other, by being a mark of a mark of a mark 
of it.

Chapter V. 
OF DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS- 

^ 1 . If, as laid down in the two preceding chap- 
ters, the foundation of all sciences, even deductive or 
demonstrative sciences, is Induction ; if every step in 
the ratiocinations even of geometry is an act of induc- 
tion ; and if a train of reasoning is but bringing many 
inductions to bear upon the same subject of inquiry, 
and drawing a case withm one induction by means of 
another; wherein lies the peculiar certainty always 
ascribed to the sciences which are entirely, or almost 
entirely, deductive ? Why are they called the Exact 
Sciences? Why are mathematical certainty, and the 
evidence of demonstration, common phrases to express 
the very highest degree of assurance attainable by 
reason ? Why are mathematics by almost all philo- 
sophers, and (by many) even those branches of natural 
philosophy which, through the medium of mathe- 
matics, have been converted into deductive sciences, 
considered to be independent of the evidence of 
experience and observation, and characterised as 
systems of Necessary Truth ? 

The answer I conceive to be, that this character 
of necessity, ascribed to the truths of mathematics, 
and even (with some reservations to be hereafter 
made) the peculiar certainty attributed to them, is 
an illusion; in order to sustain which, it is necessary 
to suppose that those truths relate to, and express 
the properties of, purely imaginary objects. It is 
acknowledged that the conchisions of geometry are 
deduced, partly at least, from the so-called Defini-

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 297 

tions, and that those definitions are assumed to be 
correct descriptions, as far as they go, of the objects 
with which^ g^metry is conversant. Now we have 
pointed out that, from a definition as such, no propo- 
sition, unless it be one concerning the meaning 6f a 
word, can ever follow; and that what apparently 
follows from a definition, follows in reality from an 
implied assumption that there exists a real thing con- 
formable thereto. This assumption, in the case of 
the definitions of geometry, is false; there exist no 
real things exactly conformabfe to the definitions. 
There exist no points without magnitude; no lines 
without breadth, nor perfectly straight ; no circles 
with all their radii exactly equal, nor squares with 
all their angles perfectly right. It will perhaps be 
said that the assumption does n.ot extend to the 
actual, but only to the possible, existence of such 
things. I answer that, according to any test we have 
of possibility, they are not even possible. Their exist- 
ence, so far as we can form any judgment, would 
seem to be inconsistent with the physical constitution 
gf our planet at least, if not of the universe. To get 
rid of this difficulty, and at the same time to save the 
credit of the supposed systems of necessary truth, it 
is customary to say that the points, lines, circles, and 
squares which are the subject of geometry, exist in our 
conceptions merely, and are part of our minds; which 
minds, by working on their own materials, construct 
an a priori science, the evidence of which is purely 
mental, and has nothing whatever to do with outward 
experience. By howsoever high authorities this doc- 
trine may have been sanctioned, it appears to me 
psychologically incorrect. The points, lines, circles, 
and squares, which any one has in his mind, are (I 
apprehend) simply copies of the points, hues, circles,

and squares which he has known in his experience. 
A line as defined by geometers is wholly mconceivable. 
We can reason about a line as if it had no breadth ; 
because we have a power, which is the foundation of 
all the control we can exercise over the operations of 
our minds; the power, when a perception is present to 
our senses, or a conception to our intellects, of attend- 
ing to a part only of that perception or conception, 
instead of the whole. But we cannot conceive a line 
without breadth ; we can form no mental picture of 
such a line : all the lines which we have in our minds 
are lines possessing breadth. If any one doubts this, 
we may refer him to his own experience. I much 
question if any one who fancies that he can conceive 
what is called a mathematical line, thinks so from the 
evidence of his consciousness : I suspect it is rather 
because he supposes that unless such a conception 
were possible, mathematics could not exist as a 
science: a supposition which there will be no difficulty 
in showing to be entirely groundless. 

Since then neither in nature, nor in the human mind, 
do there exist any objects exactly corresponding to the 
definitions of geometry, while yet that science cannot 
be supposed to be conversant about non-entities ; 
nothing remains but to consider geometry as conver- 
sant with such lines, angles, and figures as really 
exist ; and the definitions, as they are called, must be 
regarded as some of our first and most obvious gene- 
raUzations concerning those natural objects. The cor- 
rectness of those generalizations^ as generalizations, is 
without a flaw: the equality of all the radii of a circle 
is true of all circles^ so far as it is true of any one : 
but it is not exactly true of any circle : it is only nearly 
true; so nearly that no error of any importance in prac- 
tice will be incurred by feigning it to be exactly true.

When we have occasion to extend these mductions, or 
their consequences, to cases in which the error would 
be appreciable — to lines of perceptible breadth or thick- 
ness, parallels which deviate sensibly from equidistance, 
and the like — we correct our conclusions, by combining 
with them a fresh set of propositions relating to the 
aberration; just as we also take in propositions relating 
to thp physical or chemical properties of the material, 
if those properties happen to introduce any modifica- 
tion into the result, which they easily may, even with 
respect to figure and magnitude, as in the case, for 
instance, of expansion by heat. So long, however, as 
there exists no practical necessity for attending to any 
of the properties of the object except its geometrical pro- 
perties, or to any of the natural irregularities in those, 
it is convenient to neglect the consideration of the other 
properties and of the irregularities, and to reason as if 
these did not exist: accordingly, we formally announce, 
in the definitions, that we intend to proceed on this 
plan. But it is an error to suppose, because we resolve 
to confine our attention to a certain number of the 
properties of an object, that we therefore conceive, 
or have an idea of, the object, denuded of its other 
properties. We are thinking, all the time, of precisely 
such objects as we have seen and touched, and with 
all the properties which naturally belong to them; 
but, for scientific convenience, we feign them to be 
divested of all properties, except those in regard to 
which we design to consider them. 

The peculiar accuracy, supposed to be charac- 
teristic of the first principles of geometry, thus appears 
to be fictitious. The assertions on which the reason- 
ings of the science are founded, do not, any more 
than in other sciences, exactly correspond with the 
fact ; but we suppose that they do so, for the sake of

tracing the consequences which follow from the sup- 
position. The opinion of Dugald Stewart respecting 
the foundations of geometry, is, I conceive, substan- 
tially correct ; that it is built upon hypotheses ; that 
it owes to this alone the peculiar certainty supposed 
to distinguish it ; and that in any science whatever, 
by reasoning from a set of hypotheses, we may obtain 
a body of conclusions as certain as those of geometry, 
that is, as strictly in accordance with the hypotheses, 
and as irresistibly compellmg assent on condition that 
those hypotheses are true. 

When, therefore, it is affirmed that the conclusions 
of geometry are necessary truths, the necessity con- 
sists in reality only in this, that they necessarily follow 
from the suppositions from which they are deduced. 
Those suppositions are so far from being necessary, 
that they are not even true ; they purposely depart, 
more or less widely, from the truth. The only sense 
in which necessity can be ascribed to the conclusions 
of any scientific investigation, is that of necessarily 
following from some assumption, which, by the con- 
ditions of the inquiry, is not to be questioned. In 
this relation, of course, the derivative truths of every 
deductive science must stand to the mductions, or 
assumptions, on which the science is founded, and 
which, whether true or untrue, certain or doubtful in 
themselves, are always supposed certain for the pur- 
poses of the particular science. And therefore the 
conclusions of all deductive sciences were said by the 
ancients to be necessary propositions. We have 
observed already that to be predicated necessarily was 
characteristic of the predicable Proprium, and that a 
proprium was any property of a thing which could be 
deduced from its essence, that is, from the properties 
included in its definition.

$ 2. The important doctrine of Dugald Stewart, 
which I have endeavoured to enforce, has been con- 
tested by a living philosopher, Mr. Whewell, both in 
the dissertation appended to his excellent Mechanical 
Euclid, and in his more recent elaborate work on the 
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences; in which last he 
also replies to an article in the Edinburgh Review^ 
(ascribed to a writer of great scientific eminence,) in 
which Stewart's opinion was defended against his 
former strictures. Mr. Whewell's mode of refuting 
Stewart is to prove against him (as has also been done 
in this work), that the premisses of geometry are not 
definitions, but assumptions of the real existence of 
things corresponding to those definitions. This, how- 
ever, is doing little for Mr. Whewell's purpose, for it 
is these very assumptions which we say are hypotheses, 
and which he, if he denies that geometrj- is founded 
on hjrpotheses, must show to be absolute truths. All 
he does, however, is to observe, that they at any 
rate are not arbitrary hypotheses; that we should 
not be at liberty to substitute other hypotheses for 
them ; that not only " a definition, to be admissible, 
must necessarily refer to and agree with some con- 
ception which we can distinctly frame in our 
thoughts," but that the straight Unes, for instance, 
which we define, must be '' those by which angles are 
contained, those by which triangles are bounded, those 
of which parallelism may be predicated, and the 
like*.*' And this is true ; but this has never been 
contradicted. Those who say that the premisses of 
geometry are hypotheses, are not bound to maintain 
them to be hypotheses which have no relation what-

302 RBASONING. 

ever to fact. Since an hypothesis framed for the 
purpose of scientific inquiry must relate to something 
which has real existence, (for there can be no science 
respecting non-entities,) it follows that any hypothesis 
we make respecting an object, to faciUtate our study 
of it, must not involve anything which is distinctly 
false, and repugnant to its real nature : we must not 
ascribe to the thing any property which it has not; 
our liberty extends only to suppressing some of those 
which it has, under the indispensable obligation of 
restoring them whenever, and in as far as, their 
presence or absence would make any material differ- 
ence in the truth of our conclusions. Of this nature, 
accordingly, are the first principles involved in the 
definitions of geometry. In their positive part they 
are observed facts ; it is only in their negative part 
that they are hypothetical. That the hypotheses should 
be of this particular character, is, however, no further 
necessary, than inasmuch as no others could enable 
us to deduce conclusions which, with due corrections, 
would be true of real objects : and in fact, when our 
aim is only to illustrate truths and not to investigate 
them, we are not under any such restriction. We 
might suppose an imaginary animal, and work out by 
deduction, from the known laws of physiology, its 
natural history; or an imaginary commonwealth, and 
from the elements composing it, might argue what 
would be its fate. And the conclusions which, we 
might thus draw from purely arbitrary hypotheses, 
might form a highly useful intellectual exercise : but 
as they could only teach us what would be the pro- 
perties of objects which do not really exist, they 
would not constitute any addition to our knowledge : 
while on the contrary, if the hypothesis merely divests 
a real object of some portion of its properties, without

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 303 

clothing it in false ones, the conclusions will always 
express, under known liability to correction^ actual 
truth. 

$ 3. But although Mr. Whewell has not shaken 
Stewart's doctrine as to the hypothetical character of 
that portion of the first principles of geometry which 
are involved in the so-called definitions, he has, I 
conceive, greatly the advantage of Stewart on another 
important point in the theory of geometrical reasoning ; 
the necessity of admitting, among those first principles, 
axioms as well as definitions. Some of the axioms of 
Euclid might, no doubt, be exhibited in the form of 
definitions, or might be deduced, by reasoning, from 
propositions similar to what are so called. Thus, if 
instead of the axiom. Magnitudes which can be made 
to coincide are equal, we introduce a definition, 
" Equal magnitudes are those which maybe so applied 
to one another as to coincide;'* the three axioms which 
follow, (Magnitudes which are equal to the same are 
equal to one another — If equals are added to equals 
the sums are equal — If equals are taken from equals 
the remainders are equal,) may be proved by an 
imaginary superposition, resembling that by which 
the fourth proposition of the first book of Euclid is 
demonstrated. But although these and several others 
may be struck out of the list of first principles, 
becajise, though not requiring demonstration, they are 
susceptible of it ; there will be found in the list of 
axioms two or three fimdamental truths, not capable 
of being demonstrated : among which I agree with 
Mr. Whewell in placing the proposition that two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space, (or its equivalent, 
Straight lines which coincide in two points coincide 
altogether,) and some property of parallel lines, other

304 REASONING. 

than that which constitutes their definition : the most 
suitable, perhaps, being that selected by Professor 
Playfair : " Two straight lines which intersect each 
other cannot both of them be parallel to a third straight 
line*-" 

The axioms, as well those which are indemon- 
strable as those which admit of being demonstrated, 
differ from that other class of fundamental principles 
which are involved in the definitions, in this, that 
they are true without any mixture of hypothesis. 
That things which are equal to the same thing are 
equal to one another, is as true of the lines and 
figures in nature, as it would be of the imaginary ones 
assumed in the definitions. In this respect, however, 
mathematics are only on a par with most other 
sciences. In almost all sciences there are some 
general propositions which are exactly true, while the 
greater part are only more or less distant approxima- 
tions to the truth. Thus in mechanics, the first law 
of motion, (the continuance of a movement once 
impressed, until stopped or slackened by some resisting 
force,) is true without a particle of qualification or 



* We mijrht, it is true, insert this property into the definition of 
parallel lines, framing the definition so as to require, both that when 
produced indefinitely they shall never meet, and aUo that any 
straight line which intersects one of them shall, if prolonged, meet 
the other. But by doing this we by no means get rid of the 
assumption; we are still obliged to take for granted the geometrical 
truth, that all straight lines in the same plane, which have the 
former of these properties, have also the latter. For if it were 
possible that they should not, that is, if any straight lines other 
than those which are parallel according to the definition, had the 
property of never meeting although indefinitely produced, the 
demonstrations of the subsequent portions of the theory of parallels 
could not be maintained.

error ; it is not affected by the frictions, rigidities, and 
miscellaneous disturbing causes, which qualify, for 
example, the theories of the lever and of the pulley. 
The rotation of the earth in twenty-four hours, of the 
same length as in our time, has gone on since the 
first accurate observations, without the increase or 
diminution of one second in all that period. These are 
inductions which require no fiction to make them be 
received as accurately true : but along with them there 
are others, as for instance the propositions respecting 
the figure of the earth, which are but approximations 
to the truth ; and in order to use them for the further 
advancement of our knowledge, we must feign that 
they are exactly true, although they really want some- 
thing of being so. 

§ 4. It remains to inquire, what is the ground of 
our belief in axioms — what is the evidence on which 
they rest ? I answer, they are experimental truths ; 
generalizations from observation. The proposition, 
IVo straight lines cannot inclose a space — or in othei* 
words. Two straight lines which have once met, do 
not meet again, but continue to diverge — is an induc- 
tion from the evidence of our senses. 

This opinion runs counter to a philosophic pre- 
judice of long standing and great strength, and there is 
probably no one proposition enunciated in this work for 
which a more unfavourable reception is to be expected. 
It is, however, no new opinion ; and even if it were 
so, would be entitled to be judged, not by its novelty, 
but by the strength of the arguments by which it can 
be supported. I consider it very fortunate that so 
eminent a champion of the contrary opinion as Mr. 
Whewell, has recently found occasion for a most 
elaborate treatment of the whole theory of axioms, in

attempting to construct the philosophy of the mathe- 
matical and physical sciences on the basis of the 
doctrine against which I now contend. Whoever is 
anxious that a discussion should go to the bottom of 
the subject, must rejoice to see the opposite side of the 
question worthily represented. If what is said by 
such a man as Mr. "Whewell, in support of an opinion 
which he has made the foundation of a systematic 
work, can be shown not to be conclusive, enough 
will have been done without going further to seek 
stronger arguments and a more powerful adversary. 

It is not necessary to show that the truths which 
we call axioms are originally suggested by observa- 
tion, and that we should never have known that two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space if we had never 
seen a straight line: thus much being admitted by 
Mr. Whewell, and by all, in recent times, who have 
adopted his view of the subject. But they contend^ 
that it is not experience which proves the axiom ; but 
that its truth is perceived a priori, by the constitution 
of the mind itself, from the first moment when the 
meaning of the proposition is apprehended; and without 
any necessity for verifying it by repeated trials, as is 
requisite in the case of truths really ascertained by 
observation. 

They cannot, however, but allow that the truth of 
the axiom. Two straight lines cannot inclose a space, 
even if evident independently of experience, is also 
evident from experience. Whether the axiom needs 
confirmation or not, it receives confirmation in almost 
every instant of our lives; since we cannot look at any 
two straight lines which intersect one another, without 
seeing that from that point they continue to diverge 
more and more. Experimental proof crowds in upon 
us in such endless profusion, and without one instance

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 307 

in which there can be even a suspicion of an excep- 
tion to the rule, that we should soon have a stronger 
ground for believing the axiom, even as an experi- 
mental truth, than we have for almost any of the 
general truths which we confessedly learn from the 
evidence of our senses. Independently of a priori 
evidence, we should certainly believe it with an inten- 
sity of conviction far greater than we accord to any 
ordinary physical truth : and this too at a time of life 
much earlier than that from which we date almost any 
part of our acquired knowledge, and much too early 
to admit of our retaining any recollection of the 
history of our intellectual operations at that period. 
Where then is the necessity for assuming that our recog- 
nition of these truths has a different origin from the 
rest of our knowledge, when its existence is perfectly 
accounted for by supposing its origin to be the same ? 
when the causes which produce beUef in all other 
instances, exist in this instance, and in a degree of 
strength as much superior to what exists in other 
cases, as the intensity of the belief itself is superior ? 
The burden of proof lies upon the advocates of the 
contrary opinion : it is for them to point out some 
fact, inconsistent with the supposition that this part of 
our knowledge of nature is derived from the same 
sources as every other part. 

This, for instance, they would be able to do, if 
they could prove chronologically that we have the 
conviction (at least practically) so early in infancy as 
to be anterior to those impressions on the senses, 
upon which, on the other theory, the conviction is 
founded. This, however, cannot be proved ; the point 
being too feir back to be within the reach of memory, 
and too obscure for external observation. The advo- 
cates of the d priori theory are obliged to have

308 REASONING. 

recourse to other arguments. These are reducible to 
two, which I shall endeavour to state as clearly and 
as forcibly as possible. 

§ 5. In the first place it is said, that if our assent 
to the proposition that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space, were derived from the senses, we 
could only be convinced of its truth by actual trial, 
that is, by seeing or feeling the straight lines; whereas 
in fact it is seen to be true by merely thinking of 
them. That a stone thrown into water goes to 
the bottom, may be perceived by our senses, but 
mere thinking of a stone thrown into the water will 
never lead us to that conclusion: not so, however, 
with the axioms relating to straight lines : if I could 
be made to conceive what a straight line is, without 
having seen one, I should at once recognise that two 
such lines cannot inclose a space. Intuition is 
"imaginary looking*;" but experience must be real 
looking : if we see a property of straight lines to be 
true by merely fancying ourselves to be looking at 
them, the ground of our belief cannot be the senses, 
or experience ; it must be something mental. 

To this argument it might be added in the case 
of this particular axiom (for the assertion would not 
be true of all axioms), that the evidence of it from 
actual ocular inspection, is not only unnecessary, but 
unattainable. What says the axiom? That two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space; that after 
having once intersected, if they are prolonged to 
infinity they do not meet, but continue to diverge 
from one another. How can this, in any single case, 
be proved by actual observation? We may follow 



* Whbwbll's PhUoiophy of the Inductive Sciences, i. 130.

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS, 309 

the lines to any distance we please ; but we cannot 
follow them to infinity: for aught our senses can 
testify, they may, immediately beyond the farthest 
point to which we have traced them, begin to approach, 
and at last meet. Unless, therefore, we had some 
other proof of the impossibility than observation 
affords us, we should have no ground for believing 
the axiom at all. 

To these arguments, which I trust I cannot be 
accused of understating, a satisfactory answer will, I 
conceive, be found, if we advert to one of the charac- 
teristic properties of geometrical forms — their capacity 
of being painted in the imagination with a distinctness 
equal to reality: in other words, the exact resemblance 
of our ideas of form to the sensations which suggest 
them. This, in the first place, enables us to make 
(at least with a little practice) mental pictured of all 
possible combinations of lines and angles, which 
resemble the realities quite as well as any which we 
could make upon paper ; and in the next place, makes 
those pictures just as fit subjects of geometrical 
experimentation as the realities themselves ; inasmuch 
as pictures, if sufficiently accurate, exhibit of course 
all the properties which would be manifested by the 
realities at one given instant^ and on simple inspec- 
tion: and in geometry we are concerned only with 
such properties, and not with that which pictures 
could not exhibit, the mutual action of bodies one 
upon another. The foundations of geometry would 
therefore be laid in direct experience, even if the 
experiments (which in this case consist merely in 
attentive contemplation) were practised solely upon 
what we call our ideas, that is, upon the diagrams in 
our minds, and not upon outward objects. For in all 
systems of experimentation we take some objects to 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



310 REASONING. 

serve as representatives of all which resemhle them ; 
and in the present case the conditions which qualify a 
real object to be the representative of its class, are 
completely fulfilled by an object existing only in our 
fancy. Without denying, therefore, the possibility of 
satisfying ourselves that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space, by merely thinking of straight lines 
without actually looking at them; I contend, that we 
do not believe this truth on the ground of the imagi- 
nary intuition simply, but because we know that the 
imaginary lines exactly resemble real ones, and that 
we may conclude from them to real ones with quite as 
much certainty as we could conclude from one real 
line to another. The conclusion, therefore, is still an 
induction from observation. And we should not be 
authorized to substitute observation of the image in 
our mind, for observation of the reality, if we had not 
learnt by long continued experience that all the pro* 
perties of the reality are faithfuUy represented in the 
image ; just as we should be scientifically warranted 
in describing the shape and colour of an animal which 
we had never seen, from a photogenic picture made of 
it with a daguerreotype; but not until we had learnt 
by ample experience, that observation of such a 
picture is precisely equivalent to observation of the 
original. 

These considerations also remove the objection 
arising from the impossibility of ocularly following 
the lines in their prolongation to infinity. For though, 
in order actually to see that two given lines never 
meet, it would be necessary to follow them to infinity; 
yet without doing so we may know that if they ever 
do meet, or indeed if, after diverging from one ano- 
ther, they begin again to approach, this must take 
place not at an infinite, but at a finite distance. Sup-

posing, therefore, such to be the case, we can trans- 
port ourselves thither in imagination, and can frame a 
mental image of the appearance which one or both of 
the lines must present at that point, which we may 
rely upon as being precisely similar to the reaUty. 
Now, whether we fix our contemplation upon this 
imaginary picture, or call to mind the generalizations 
we have had occasion to make from former ocular 
observation, we shall either way be equally satisfied, 
that a line which, after diverging from another straight 
line, begins to approach to it, produces the impression 
on our senses which we describe by the expression, 
" a bent line," not by the expression, " a straight 
line.'' 

§ 6. The first of the two great arguments in support 
of the theory that axioms are a priori truths, having, 
I think, been sufficiently answered; I proceed to the 
second, on which most stress is usually laid, and which 
is chiefly insisted upon by Mr. Whewell. Axioms 
(it is asserted) are conceived by us not only as true, 
but as universally and necessarily true. Now, experi- 
ence cannot possibly give to any proposition this 
character. I may have seen snow a hundred times, 
and may have seen that it was white, but this cannot 
give me entire assurance even that all snow is white ; 
much less that snow must be white. ** However many 
instances we may have observed of the truth of a 
proposition, there is nothing to assure us that the 
next case shall not be an exception to the rule. If it 
be strictly true that every ruminant animal yet known 
has cloven hoofs, we still cannot be sure that some 
creature will not hereafter be discovered which has the 
first of these attributes, without having the other, . . . 
Experience must always consist of a limited number

312 REASONING. 

of observations ; and, however numerous these may 
be, they can show nothing with regard to the infinite 
number of cases in which the experiment has not been 
made." Moreover, axioms are not only universal, they 
are also necessary. Now ** experience cannot oflTer 
the smallest ground for the necessity of a proposition. 
She can observe and record what has happened ; but 
she cannot find, in any case, or in any accumulation 
of cases, any reason for what nmst happen. She may 
see objects side by side ; but she cannot see a reason 
why they must ever be side by side. She finds certain 
events to occur in succession; but the succession 
supplies, in its occurrence, no reason for its recur- 
rence. She contemplates external objects ; but she 
cannot detect any internal bond, which indissolubly 
connects the future with the past, the possible with 
the real. To learn a proposition by experience, and 
to see it to be necessarily true, are two altogether 
dijflferent processes of thought*." And Mr. Whewell 
adds, *^ If any one does not clearly comprehend this 
distinction of necessary and contingent truths, he will 
not be able to go along with us in our researches into 
the foundations of human knowledge ; nor, indeed, to 
pursue with success any speculation on the subjectf." 
In order to learn what the distinction is, the non- 
recognition of which incurs this denunciation, let us 
refer again to Mr. Whewell. ** Necessary truths are 
those in which we not only learn that the proposition 
is true, but see that ir must be true ; in which the 
negation of the truth is not only false, but impossible ; 
in which we cannot, even by an effort of imagination, 
or in a supposition, conceive the reverse of that which

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 313 

is asserted. That there are such truths cannot be 
doubted. We may take, for example, all relations of 
number. Three and Two, added together, make Five. 
We cannot conceive it to be otherwise. We cannot, 
by any freak of thought, ima^ne Three and Two to 
make Seven*." 

Although Mr. Whewell has naturally and properly 
employed a variety of phrases to bring his meaning 
more forcibly home, he will, I presume, allow that 
they are all equivalent ; and that what he means by 
a necessary truth, would be sufficiently defined, a 
proposition the negation of which is not only false 
but inconceivable. I am unable to find in any of 
Mr. Whewell's expressions, turn them what way you 
will, a meaning beyond this, and I do not believe he 
would contend that they mean anything more. 

This, therefore, is the principle asserted: that pro- 
positions, the negation of which is inconceivable, or 
in other words, which we cannot figure to ourselves 
as being false, must rest upon evidence of a higher 
and more cogent description than any which experi* 
ence can afford. ^ And we have next to consider 
whether there is any ground for this assertion. 

Now I cannot but wonder that so much stress 
should be laid upon the circumstance of inconceiv- 
ableness, when' there is such ample experience to 
show, that our capacity or incapacity of conceiving a 
thing has very little to do with the possibility of the 
thing in itself ; bat is in truth very much an affair 
of accident, and depends upon the past history and 
habits of our own minds. There is no more generally 
acknowledged fact in human nature, than the extreme 
difficulty at first felt in conceiving anything as pos-

sible, which is in contradiction to long established 
and familiar experience ; or even to old and familiar 
habits of thought. And this difficulty is a necessary 
result of the fundamental laws of the human mind. 
When we have often seen and thought of two things 
together, and have never in any one instance either 
seen or thought of them separately, there is by the 
primary law of association an increasing difficulty, 
which in the end becomes insuperable, of conceiving 
the two things apart. This is most of all conspicuous 
in uneducated persons, who are in general utterly 
unable to separate any two ideas which have once 
become firmly associated in their minds ; and if per- 
sons of cultivated intellect have any advantage on the 
point, it is only because, having seen and heard and 
read more, and being more accustomed to exercise 
their imagination, they have experienced their sensa- 
tions and thoughts in more varied combinations, and 
have been prevented from forming many of these 
inseparable associations. But this advantage has 
necessarily its limits. The man of the most prac- 
tised intellect is not exempt from the universal laws 
of our conceptive faculty. If daily habit presents to 
him for a long period two facts in combination, and 
if he is not led during that period either by accident 
or intention to think of them apart, he will in time 
become incapable of doing so even by the strongest 
effi^rt ; and the supposition that the two facts can be 
separated in nature, will at last present itself to his 
mind with all the characters of an inconceivable 
phenomenon. There are remarkable instances of this 
in the history of science: instances, in which the 
wisest men rejected as impossible, because incon- 
ceivable, things which their posterity, by earlier 
practice and longer perseverance in the attempt.

found it quite easy to conceive, and which everybody 
now knows to be trae. There was a time when men 
of the most cultivated intellects, and the most eman- 
cipated from the dominion of early prejudice, could 
not credit the existence of antipodes ; were unable to 
conceive, in opposition to old association, the force 
of gravity acting upwards instead of downwards. The 
Cartesians long rejected the Newtonian doctrine of the 
gravitation of all bodies towards one another, on the 
faith of a general proposition, the reverse of which 
seemed to them to be inconceivable — the proposition 
that a body cannot act where it is not. All the 
cumbrous machinery of imaginary vortices, assumed 
without the smallest particle of evidence, appeared 
to these philosophers a more rational mode of explain- 
ing the heavenly motions, than one which involved 
what seemed to them so great an absiurdity*. And 
they no doubt found it as impossible to conceive that 
a body should act upon the earth, at the distance of 
the Sim or moon, as we find it to conceive an end to 



* It would be difficult to name a man more remarkable at onoe 
for the greatness and the universality of his intellectual powers, than 
Leibnitz. Yet this great man gave as a reason for rejecting New- 
ton s scheme of the solar system, that God catdd not make a body 
revolve round a distant centre, unless either by some impelling 
mechanism, or by miracle: — ^"Tout ce qui n'est pas explicable" 
says he in a letter to the Abb6 Conti, '^ par la nature des creatures,

de nature; done la chose est naturelle. II faut que la loi soit exe-

space or time, or two straight lines inclosing a space. 
Newton himself had not been able to reaUze the con- 
ception, or we should not have had his hypothesis of 
a subtle ether, the occult cause of gravitation ; and 
his writings prove, that although he deemed the par- 
ticular nature of the intermediate agency a matter 
of conjecture, the necessity of some such agency 
appeared to him indubitable. It would seem that 
even now the majority of scientific men have not 
completely got over this very difficulty; for though 
they have at last learnt to conceive the sun attracting 
the earth without any intervening fluid, they cannot 
yet conceive the sun illuminating the earth without 
some such medium. 

If, then, it be so natural to the human mind, even 
in its highest state of culture, to be incapable of con- 
ceiving, and on that ground to believe impossible, 
what is afterwards not only found to be conceivable 
but proved to l)e true; what wonder if in cases 
where the association is still older, more confirmed, 
and more familiar, and in which nothing ever occurs 
to shake our conviction, or even suggest to us any 
conception at variance with the association, the ac- 
quired incapacity should continue, and be mistaken 
for a natural incapacity ? It is true our experience 
of the varieties in nature enables us, within certain 
limits, to conceive other varieties analogous to them. 
We can conceive the sun or moon falUng ; for although 
we never saw them fall, nor ever perhaps imagined 
them falling, we have seen so many other things fall, 
that we have innumerable familiar analogies to assist the 
conception; which, after all, we should probably have 
some difficulty in framing, were we not well accustomed 
to see the sun and moon move (or appear to move), 
so that we are only called upon to conceive a slight

change in the direction of motion, a circumstance 
familiar to our experience. But when experience 
affords no model on which to shape the new concep- 
tion, how is it possible for us to form it ? How, for 
example, can we imagine an end to space or time ? 
We never saw any object without something beyond 
it, nor experienced any feeling without something 
following it. When, therefore, we attempt to con- 
ceive the last point of space, we have the idea irresist- 
ibly raised of other points beyond it. When we try. 
to imagine the last instant of time, we cannot help 
conceiving another instant after it. Nor is there any 
necessity to assmne, as is done by the school to 
which Mr. Whewell belongs, a peculiar fnndamental 
law of the mind to account for the feeling of infinity 
inherent in our conceptions of space and time ; that 
apparent infinity is suflBiciently accounted for by simpler 
and universally acknowledged laws. 

Now, in the case of a geometrical axiom, such, for 
example, as that two straight lines cannot inclose a 
space, — a trath which is testified to us by our very 
earliest impressions of the external world, — how is it 
possible (whether those external impressions be or be 
not the ground of our belief) that the reverse of the 
proposition can be otherwise than inconceivable to us? 
What analogy have we, what similar order of facts in 
any other branch of our experience, to facilitate to us 
the conception of two straight lines inclosing a space? 
Nor is even this all. I have already called attention 
to the peculiar property of our impressions of form, 
that the ideas or mental images exactly resemble 
their prototypes, and adequately represent them for 
the purposes of scientific observation. From this, 
and from the intuitive character of the observation,

which in this case reduces itself to simple inspection, 
we cannot so much as call up in our imagination two 
straight lines, in order to attempt to conceive them 
inclosing a space, without by that very act repeating 
the philosophical experiment which establishes the 
contrary. Will it really be contended that the incon- 
ceivableness of the thing, under such circumstances, 
proves anything against the experimental origin of the 
conviction ? Is it not clear that in whichever mode 
our belief in the proposition may have originated, the 
impossibility of our conceiving the negative of it must, 
under either hypothesis, be the same? As, then, 
Mr. Whewell exhorts those who have any difficulty 
in recognising the distinction held by him between 
necessary and contingent truths, to study geometry, — 
a condition which I can assure him I have con- 
scientioasly fulfilled, — I, in return, with equal confi- 
dence, exhort those who agree with Mr. Whewell, to 
study the elementary laws of association ; being con- 
vinced that nothing more is requisite than a moderate 
familiarity with those laws, to dispel the illusion 
which ascribes a peculiar necessity to our earliest 
inductions from experience, and measures the possi- 
bility of things in themselves, by the human capacity 
of conceiving them. 

I hope to be pardoned for adding, that Mr. Whe- 
well himself has both confirmed by his testimony the 
efiect of habitual association in giving to an expe- 
rimental truth the appearance of a necessary one, and 
afforded a striking instance of that remarkable law 
in his own person. In his Philosophy of the Inductive 
Sciences he continually asserts, that propositions 
which not only are not self-evident, but which we 
know to have been discovered gradually, and by great

efforts of genius and patience, have, when once 
established, appeared so self-evident that, but for 
historical evidence, it would have been impossible to 
conceive that they had not been recognised from the 
first by all persons in a sound state of their faculties. 
"We now despise those who, in the Copemican 
controversy, could not conceive the apparent motion 
of the sun on the heliocentric hypothesis ; or those 
who, in opposition to Galileo, thought that a uniform 
force might be that which generated a velocity pro- 
portional to the space ; or those who held there was 
something absurd in Newton's doctrine of the different 
refrangibility of differently coloured rays; or those 
who imagined that when elements combine, their 
sensible qualities must be manifest in the compound ; 
or those who were reluctant to give up the distinction 
of vegetables into herbs, shrubs, and trees. We 
cannot help thinking that men must have been 
singularly dull of comprehension to find a difficulty 
in admitting what is to us so plain and simple. We 
have a latent persuasion that we in their place should 
have been wiser and more clearsighted; that we 
should have taken the right side, and given our 
assent at once to the truth. Yet in reality such a 
persuasion is a mere delusion. The persons who, in 
such instances as the above, were on the losing side, 
were very far in most cases from being persons more 
prejudiced, or stupid, or narrow-minded, than the 
greater part of mankind now are ; and the cause for 
which they fought was far from being a manifestly 
bad one, till it had b6en so decided by the result of 
the war . . So complete has been the victory of 
truth in most of these instances, that at present we 
can hardly imagine the struggle to have been neces- 
sary. The very essence of these triumphs is^ that they

lead us to regard the vietvs we reject a^ not only false, 
but inconceivable* " 

This last proposition is precisely what I conteDd 
for ; and I ask no more, in order to overthrow the 
whole theory of Mr. Whewell on the nature of the 
evidence of axioms. For what is that theory? That 
the truth of axioms cannot have been learnt from 
experience, because their falsity is inconceivable. But 
Mr. Whewell himself says, that we are continually led 
by the natural progress of thought, to regard as 
inconceivable what our forefathers not only conceived 
but believed, nay, even (he might have added) were 
unable to conceive the contrary of. Mr. Whewell can- 
not intend to justify this mode of thought; he cannot 
mean to say, that we can be right in regarding as 
inconceivable what others have conceived, and as 
self-evident what to others did not appear evident at 
all. After so complete an admission that inconceiva- 
bleness is an accidental thing, not inherent in the 
phenomenon itself, but dependent on the mental 
history of the person who tries to conceive it, how 
can he ever call upon us to reject a proposition 
as impossible on no other ground than its incon- 
ceivableness? Yet he not only does so, but has unin- 
tentionally afforded some of the most remarkable 
examples which can be cited of the very illusion 
which he has himself so clearly pointed out. We 
select as specimens, his remarks on the evidence 
of the three laws of motion, and of the atomic 
theory. 

With respect to the laws of motion, Mr. Whewell 
says: *'No one can doubt that, in historical fact, these 
laws were collected from experience. That such is

the case, is no matter of conjecture. We know the 
time, the persons, the circumstances, belonging to 
each step of each discover}^*." After such a testi- 
mony, to adduce evidence of the fact would be 
superfluous. And not only were these laws by no 
means intuitively evident, but some of them were 
originally paradoxes. The first law was especially so. 
That a body, once in motion, would continue for ever 
to move in the same direction with undiminished 
velocity unless acted upon by some new force, was a 
proposition which mankind found for a long time the 
greatest difficulty in crediting. It stood opposed to 
apparent experience of the most famiUar kind, which 
taught that it was the nature of motion to abate 
gradually, and at last terminate of itself. Yet when 
once the contrary doctrine was firmly established, 
mathematicians, as Mr. Whewell observes, speedily 
began to believe that laws, thus contradictory to first 
appearances, and which, even after full proof had 
been obtained, it had required generations to render 
famihar to the minds of the scientific world, were 
under " a demonstrable necessity, compeUing them to 
be such as they are and no other;" and Mr. Whewell, 
though he has " not ventured absolutely to pro- 
nounce'* that all these laws "can be rigorously 
traced to an absolute necessity in the nature of 
thingst," does actually think in that manner of the 
law just mentioned; of which he says: ** Though the 
discovery of the first law of motion was made, histo- 
rically speaking, by means of experiment, we have 
now attained a point of view in which we see that it 
might have been certainly known to be true, inde-

peDdently of experience*." Can there be a more 
striking exemplification than is here afforded, of the 
effect of association which we have described ? Philo- 
sophers, for generations, have the most extraordinary 
difficulty in putting certain ideas together; they at 
last succeed in doing so; and after a sufficient repe- 
tition of the process, they first fancy a natural bond 
between the ideas, then experience a growing difficulty, 
which at last, by the continuation of the same pro- 
gress, becomes an impossibility, of severing them from 
one another. If such be the progress of an experi- 
mental conviction of which the date is of yesterday, 
and which is in opposition to first appearances, how 
must it fare with those which are conformable to 
appearances familiar from the first dawn of intelli- 
gence, and of the conclusiveness of which, from the 
earliest records of human thought, no sceptic has 
suggested even a momentary doubt? 

The other instance which we shall quote is a truly 
astonishing one, and may be called the reductio ad 
abmrdum of the theory of inconceivableness. Speak- 
ing of the laws of chemical composition, Mr. Whewell 
saysf: ^^That they could never have been clearly 
understood, and therefore never firmly established, 
without laborious and exact experiments, is certain ; 
but yet we may venture to say, that being once known, 
they possess an evidence beyond that of mere experi- 
ment. For how^ in fact, can we conceive combinations^ 
otherwise than as definite in kind and quantity ? K we 
were to suppose each element ready to combine with 
any other indifferently, and indifferently in any quan- 
tity, we should have a world in which all would be 
confusion and indefiniteness. There would be no

fixed kinds of bodies; salts, and stones, and ores, 
would approach to and graduate into each other by 
insensible degrees. Instead of this, we know that the 
world consists of bodies distinguishable from each 
other by definite difierences, capable of being classi- 
fied and named, and of having general propositions 
asserted concerning them. And as we cannot conceive 
a world in which this should not be the case, it would 
appear that we cannot conceive a state of things in 
which the laws of the combination of elements should 
not be of that definite and measured kind which we 
have above asserted.** 

That a philosopher of Mr. WhewelFs eminence 
should gravely assert that we cannot concieve a world 
in which the simple elements would combine in other 
than definite proportions ; that by dint of meditating 
on a scientific truth, the original discoverer of which 
is still living, he should have rendered the association 
in his own mind between the idea of combination and 
that of constant proportions so familiar and intimate 
as to be unable to conceive the one fact without the 
other ; is so signal an instance of the law of human 
nature for which I am contending, that one word 
more in illustration must be quite superfluous. I 
shall only, therefore, express my satisfaction that so 
long as the progress of scientific instruction has not 
rendered this association as indissoluble in the minds 
of most people as Mr. Whewell finds it, the majo- 
rity of mankind will be fairly able to judge, from this 
example, of the value of the evidence which he deems 
sufficient to prove that a scientific proposition might 
be known to be true independently of experience*.

which maintains, ou the subject of axioms, the doctrine adyanccd 
in the text, that they are generalizations from experience, and 
supports that opinion by a line of argument strikingly coinciding 
with mine. When I state that the whole of the present chapter 
was written before I had seen the article, (the greater part, 
indeed, before it was published,) it is not my object to occupy 
the reader*s attention with a matter so unimportant as the degree 
of originality which may or may not belong to any portion of my 
own speculations, but to obtain for an opinion which is opposed to 
reigning doctrines, the recommendation derived from a striking 
concurrence of sentiment between two inquirers entirely independent 
of one another. I have much pleasure in citing from a writer of 
the extensive acquirements in physical and metaph3rsical know- 
ledge and the capacity of sjBtematic thought which the article 
evinces, passages so remarkably in unison with my own views as 
the following : — 

^' The truths of geometry are summed up and embodied in its 
definitions and axioms. . . • Let us turn to the axioms, and what 
do we find ? A string of propositions concerning magnitude in the 
abstract, which are equally true of space, time, force, number, and 
every other magnitude susceptible of aggregation and subdivision. 
Such propositions, where they are not mere definitions, as some of 
them are, carry their inductive origin on the face of their enun- 
ciation. . . . Those which declare that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space, and that two straight lines which cut one another 
cannot both be parallel to a third, are in n^ality the only ones 
which express characteristic properties of space, and these it will 
be worth while to consider more nearly. Now the only clear 
notion we can form of straightness is uniformity of direction, for 
space in its ultimate analjrsis is nothing but an assemblage of 
distances and directions. And (not to dwell on the notion of 
continued contemplation, t. «., mental experience, as included in 
the very idea of uniformity; nor on that of transfer of the con- 
templating being fr^m point to point, and of experience, during 
such transfer, of the homogeneity of the interval passed over) we 
cannot even propose the proposition in an intelligible form, to any 
one whose experience ever since he was bom has not assured him 
of the fact. The unity of direction, or that we cannot march 
from a given point by more than one path direct to the same 
object, is matter of practical experience long before it can by 
possibility become matter of abstract thought. We cannot cUtempt 
mentally to eamnplify the conditume of the auertion in an imaginary 
ca»e opposed to it^ without violating our habitual recollection of this

txperiencey mid defcu^ng <mr mental picture of space as grounded 
en it. What but experience, we may ask, can possibly assure us 
of the homogeneity of the parts of distance, time, force, and mea- 
surable aggregates in general, on which the truth of the other 
axioms depends? As regards the latter axiom, after what has 
been said it must be clear that the very same course of remarks 
equally applies to its case, and that its truth is quite as much forced 
on the mind as that of t£e former by daily and hourly experience, 
. . . including cdways^ he it observed^ in our notion of experience, that 
which is gained by contemplation of the inward picture which the 
mind forms to itself in any proposed ease^ or which it arbitrarily 
selects as an example — such picture, in virtue of the extreme simplicity 
of these primary relations, being called up by the imagination with 
as much vividness and clearness as coiUd be done by any external 
impression, which is the only meaning toe can attach to the word 
intuition, as applied to such relations,'* 

And again, of the axioms of mechanics: — ^^As we admit no 
such propositions, other than as truths inductively collected from 
observation, even in geometry itself, it can hardly be expected that, 
in a science of obviously contingent relations, we should acquiesce 
in a contrary view. Let us take one of these axioms and examine 
its evidence : for instance, that equal forces perpendicularly applied 
at the opposite ends of equal arms of a straight lever will balance 
each other. What but experience, we may ask, in the first place, 
can possibly inform us that a force so applied will have any tendency 
to turn the lever on its centre at all? or that force can be so 
transmitted along a rigid line perpendicular to its direction, as to 
act elsewhere in space than along its own line of action? Surely 
this is so far from being self-evident that it has even a paradoxical 
appearance, which is only to be removed by giving our lever thick- 
ness, material composition, and molecular powers. Again we con- 
clude, that the two forces, being equal and applied under precisely 
similar circumstances, must, if they exert any effort at all to turn 
the lever, exert equal and opposite efforts: but what d priori 
reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely 
circumstances? that points which differ in place, are similarly 
circumstanced as regards the exertion of force? that universal 
space may not have relations to universal force — or, at all events, 
that the organization of the material universe may not be such as 
to place that portion of space occupied by it in such relations to 
the forces exerted in it, as may invalidate the absolute similarity 
of circumstances assumed ? Or we may argue, what have we to do

with the notion of angular moyement in the lever ai all? The 
case is one of rest, and of quiescent destruction of force hj force. 
Now how is this destruction effected ? Assuredly by the counter- 
pressure which supports the fulcrum. But would not this destruc- 
tion equally arise, and by the same amount of counteracting force, 
if each force simply pressed its own half of the lerer against the 
fulcrum ? And what can assure us that it is not so, except removal 
of one or other force, and consequent tilting of the lever ? The 
other fundamental axiom of statics, that the pressure on the point 
of support is the sum of the weights ... is merely a scientific 
transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse and obvious 
result of universal experience, viz., that the weight of a rigid body 
is the same, handle it or suspend it in what position or by what 
point we will, and that whatever sustains it sustains its total 
weight. Assuredly, as Mr. Whewell justly remaiks, ^No one 
probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the 
pressure on the support is equal to the sum of the weights* . . . 
But it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest 
infancy he has been continually making the trial, and seeing it 
made by every other living being about him, that he never dreams 
of staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific 
accuracy. This would be as if a man should resolve to decide 
by experiment vehether his eyes were useful for the purpose of 
seeing, by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a 
metal case." 

On the ^^ paradox of universal propositions obtained by expe- 
rience,'* the same writer says : *^ If there be necessary and universal 
truths expressible in propositions of axiomatic simplicity and obvious* 
ness, and having for their subject-matter the elements of all our 
experience and all our knowledge, surely these are the truths 
which, if experience suggest to us any truths at all, it onght to 
suggest most readily, clearly, and unceasingly. If it were a truth, 
universal and necessary, that a net is spread over the whole sur&ce 
of erery planetary globe, we should not travel far on our own 
vrithout getting entangled in its meshes, and making the necessity 
of some means of extrication an axiom of locomotion. . . . There 
is, therefore, nothing paradoxical, but the reverse, in our being led 
by observation to a recognition of such truths, as general propo- 
sitions, coextensive at least with all human experience. That they 
pervade all the objects of experience, must ensure their continual 
suggestion by experience; that they are true, musk ensure that 
consistency of suggestion, that iteration of uncontradicted assertion.

^* A truth, necessary and universal, relative to any object of our 
knowledge, must verify itself in every instance where that object 
is brfore our contemplation, and if at the same time it be simple 
and intelligible, its verification must be obvious. Ths ientiment of 
9uch a truth cannot^ tfurefare^ but be present to our minds whenever 
that object is eontemplatedy and must ther^ore make a part of the 
mental picture or idea of that object which we may on any occasion 
summon before our imaghMUum. . . . AU propositions^ therrfore^ 
become not only untrue but inconceivable^ if . . . axioms be violated 
in their enunciation." 

Another high authority (if indeed it be another authority) may 
be cited in favour of the doctrine that axiorof test upon the evidence 
of .induction. ^^The axioms of geometry themselves may be 
regarded as in some sort an appeal to experience, not corporeal, but 
mental. When we say^ the whole is greater than its part, we 
announce a general fact, which rests, it is true, on our ideas of 
whole and part; but, in abstracting these notions, we begin by 
considering them as subsisting in space, and time, and body, and 
agun, in linear, and superficial, and solid space. Again, when we 
say, the equals of equals are equal, we mentally make comparisons, 
in equal spaces, equal times, &c., so that these axioms, however 
self-evident, are still general propositions so &r of the inductive 
kind, that, independently of experience, they would not present 
themselves to the mind. The only difference between these and 
axioms obtained from extensive induction is this, that, in raising 
the axioms of geometry, the instances ofier themselves spontaneously,

Chapter VI. 

THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED. 

$1. In the examination which formed the subject 
of the last chapter, into the nature of the evidence of 
those deductive sciences which are commonly repre- 
sented to be systems of necessary truth, we have 
been led to the following conclusions. The results 
of those sciences are indeed necessary, in the sense 
of necessarily following from certain first prin- 
ciples, commonly called axioms and definitions; of 
being certainly true if those axioms and definitions 
are so. But their claim to the character of necessity 
in any sense beyond this, as impljdng an evidence 
independent of and superior to observation and expe- 
rience, must depend upon the previous establishment 
of such a claim in favour of the definitions and axioms 
themselves. With regard to axioms, we found that, 
considered as experimental truths, they rest upon 
superabundant and obvious evidence. We inquired, 
whether, since this is the case, it be necessary to 
suppose any other evidence of those truths than 
experimental evidence, any other origin for our belief 
of them than an experimental origin. We decided, 
that the burden of proof lies with those who maintain 
the afiirmative, and we examined, at considerable 
length, such arguments as they have produced. The 
examination having led to the rejection of those 
arguments, we have thought ourselves warranted in 
concluding that axioms are but a class, the highest 
class, of inductions from experience: the simplest

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 329 

and easiest cases of generalization from the facts 
furnished to us by our senses or by our internal 
consciousness. 

While the axioms of demonstrative sciences thus 
appeared to be experimental truths, the definitions, as 
they are incorrectly called, of those sciences, were 
found by us to be generalizations from experience 
which are not even, accurately speaking, truths; 
being propositions in which, while we assert of some 
kind of object, some property or properties which 
observation shows to belong to it, we at the same 
time deny that it possesses any other properties, 
although in truth other properties do in every indi- 
vidual instance accompany, and in most or even in 
all instances, modify, the property thus exclusively 
predicated. The denial, therefore, is a mere fiction, 
or supposition, made for the purpose of excluding the 
consideration of those modifying circumstances, when 
their influence is of too trifling amount to be worth 
considering, or adjourning it^ when important, to a 
more convenient moment. 

From these considerations it would appear that 
Deductive or Demonstrative Sciences are all, without 
exception. Inductive Sciences; that their evidence is 
that of experience, but that they are also, in virtue of 
the peculiar character of one indispensable portion of 
the general formulae according to which their induc- 
tions are made. Hypothetical Sciences. Their conclu- 
sions are only true upon certain suppositions, which 
are, or ought to be, approximations to the truth, but 
are seldom, if ever, exactly true; and to this hypothe- 
tical character is to be ascribed the peculiar certainty, 
which is supposed to be inherent in demonstration. 

What we have now asserted, however, cannot be 
received as universally true of Deductive or Demon-

330 REASONING. 

strative Sciences until verified by being applied to the 
most remarkable of all those sciences, that of Num- 
bers; the theory of the Calculus; Arithmetic and 
Algebra. It b harder to believe of the doctrines of 
this science than of any other^ either that they are 
not truths a priori^ but experimental truths, or that 
their peculiar certainty is owing to their being not 
absolute but only conditional truths. This, therefore, 
is a case which merits examination apart ; and the 
more so, because on this subject we have a double set 
of doctrines to contend with ; that of Mr. Whewell 
and the d priori philosophers on one side ; and on the 
other, a philosophical theory the most opposite to 
theirs, which was at one time very generally received, 
and is still far from being altogether exploded among 
metaphysicians. 

$ 2. This theory attempts to solve the difficulty 
apparently inherent in the case, by representing the 
propositions of the science of numbers as merely ver- 
bal, and its processes as simple transformations of 
language, substitutions of one expression for another. 
The proposition^ Two and one are equal to three, 
according to these philosophers, is not a truth, is not 
the assertion of a really existing fact, but a definition 
of the word three; a statement that mankind have 
agreed to use the name three as a sign exactly equi- 
valent to two and one; to call by the former name 
whatever is called by the other more clumsy phrase. 
According to this doctrine, the longest process in 
algebra is but a succession of changes in terminology, 
by which equivalent expressions are substituted one 
for another ; a series of translations of the same fact, 
from one into another language ; though how, after 
such a series of translations, the fact itself comes out

DEMON STRAl ION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 331 

changed, (as when we demonstrate a new geometrical 
theorem by algebra,) they have not explained ; and it 
is a difficulty which is fatal to their theory. 

It must be acknowledged that there are pecuUari- 
ties in the processes of arithmetic and algebra which 
render the above theory very plausible, and have not 
unnaturally made those sciences the stronghold of 
Nominalism. The doctrine that we can discover facts» 
detect the hidden processes of nature, by an artful 
manipulation of language, is so contrary to common 
sense, that a person must have made some advances 
in philosophy to believe it ; men fly to so paradoxical 
a belief to avoid, as they think, some even greater dif- 
ficulty, which the vulgar do not see. What has led 
many to believe that reasoning is a mere verbal 
process, is^ that no other theory seemed reconcileable 
with the nature of the Science of Numbers. For we 
do not carry any ideas along with us when we use the 
symbols of arithmetic or of algebra. In a geometrical 
demonstration we have a mental diagram, if not one 
upon paper ; AB, AC, are present to our imagination 
as lines, intersecting other lines, forming an angle 
with one another, and the like ; but not so a and h. 
These may represent lines or any other magnitudes, 
but those magnitudes are never thought of; nothing 
is realized in our imagination but a and h. The ideas 
which, on the particular occasion, th^ happen to 
represent, are banished from the mind during every 
intermediate part of the process between the begin- 
ning, when the premisses are translated from things 
into signs, and the end, when the conclusion is trans- 
lated back from signs into things. Nothing, then, 
being in the reasoner's mind but the symbols, what 
can seem more inadmissible than to pretend that the 
reasoning process has to do with anything more ? We

seem to have come to one of Bacon's Prerogative 
Instances ; an experimentum crucis on the nature of 
reasoning itself. 

Nevertheless it will appear on consideration, that 
this apparently so decisive instance is no instance at 
all ; that there is in every step of an arithmetical or 
algebraical calculation a real induction, a real infe- 
rence of facts from facts ; and that what disguises the 
induction is simply its comprehensive nature^ and the 
consequent extreme generality of the language. All 
numbers must be nimibers of something : there are 
no such things as numbers in the abstract. Ten must 
mean ten bodies, or ten sounds, or ten beatings of the 
pulse. But though numbers must be numbers of 
something, they may be numbers of anything. Pro- 
positions, therefore, concerning numbers, have the 
remarkable peculiarity that they are propositions con- 
cerning all things whatever ; all objects, all existences 
of every kind, known to our experience. All things 
possess quantity; consist of parts which can be num- 
bered ; and in that character possess all the proper- 
ties which are called properties of numbers. That 
half of four is two must be true whatever the word 
four represents, whether four men, four miles, or four 
pounds weight. We need only conceive a thing 
divided into four equal parts, (and all things may be 
conceived as so divided,) to be able to predicate of it 
every property of the number four, that is, every 
arithmetical proposition in which the number four 
stands on one side of the equation. Algebra extends 
the generalization still farther : every number repre- 
sents that particular number of all things without dis- 
tinction, but every algebraical symbol does more, it 
represents all numbers without distinction. As soon 
as we conceive a thing divided into equal parts, with-

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 333 

out knowing into what number of parts, we may call 
it a or X, and apply to it, without danger of error, 
every algebraical formula in the books. The propo- 
sition, 2 (a +6) = 2 a+ 2 6, is a truth co-extensive with 
the creation. Since then algebraical truths are true 
of all things whatever, and not, like those of geo- 
metry, true of lines only or angles only, it is no 
wonder that the symbols should not excite in our 
minds ideas of any things in particular. When we 
demonstrate the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid, it 
is not necessary that the words should raise in us an 
image of all right-angled triangles, but only of some 
one right-angled triangle : so in algebra we need not, 
under the symbol a, picture to ourselves all things 
whatever, but only some one thing ; why not, then, 
the letter itself? The mere written characters, a, 6, 
a?, y, z^ serve as well for representatives of Things in 
general, as any more complex and apparently more 
concrete conception. That we are conscious of them 
however in their character of things, and not of mere 
signs, is evident from the fact that our whole process 
of reasoning is carried on by predicating of them the 
properties of things. In resolving an algebraic equa- 
tion, by what rules do we proceed ? By applying at 
each step to a, 6, and a?, the proposition that equals 
added to equals make equals; that equals taken from 
equals leave equals ; and other propositions founded 
upon these two. These are not properties of lan- 
guage, or of signs as such, but of magnitudes, which 
is as much as to say, of all things. The inferences, 
therefore, which are successively drawn, are inferences 
concerning Things, not symbols; although as any 
Things whatever will serve the turn, there is no neces- 
sity for keeping the idea of the Thing at all distinct, 
and consequently the process of thought may, in this

case, be allowed without danger to do what all pro- 
cesses of thought, when they have been performed 
often, will do if permitted, namely, to become entirely 
mechanical. Hence the general language of algebra 
comes to be used familiarly without exciting ideas, as 
all other general language is prone to do from mere 
habit, though in no other case than this can it be done 
with complete safety. But when we look back to see 
from whence the probative force of the process is 
derived, we find that at every single step, unless we 
suppose ourselves to be thinking and talking of the 
things, and not the mere symbols, the evidence fails. 

There is another circumstance, which^ still more 
than that which we have now mentioned, gives plausi- 
bility to the notion that the propositions of arithmetic 
and algebra are merely verbal. This is, that when 
considered as propositions respecting Things, they all 
have the appearance of being identical propositions. 
The assertion. Two and one are equal to three, consi- 
dered as an assertion respecting objects, as for instance 
**Two pebbles and one pebble are equal to three 
pebbles,'* does not affirm equality between two collec- 
tions of pebbles, but absolute identity. It affirms 
that if we put one pebble to two pebbles, those very 
pebbles are three. The objects, therefore, being the 
very same, and the mere assertion that " objects are 
themselves'' being insignificant, it seems but natural 
to consider the proposition, Two and one are equal to 
three, as asserting mere identity of signification 
between the two names. 

This, however, though it looks so plausible, will 
not stand examination. The expression, *'two peb- 
bles and one pebble/' and the expression, "three 
pebbles," stand indeed for the same aggregation of 
objects, but they by no means stand for the same

DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 335 

physical fact. They are names of the same objects, 
but of those objects in two different states : though 
they denote the same things, their connotation is 
different. Three pebbles in two separate parcels, and 
three pebbles in one parcel, do not make the same 
impression on our senses ; and the assertion that the 
very same pebbles may by an alteration of place and 
arrangement be made to produce either the one set of 
sensations or the other, though it is a very familiar 
proposition, is not an identical one. It is a truth 
known to us by early and constant experience : an 
inductive truth ; and such truths are the foundation 
of the science of Number. The fundamental truths of 
that science all rest upon the evidence of sense ; they 
are proved by showing to our eyes and our fingers 
that any given number of objects, ten balls for 
example, may by separation and re-arrangement 
exhibit to our senses all the different sets of numbers 
the sum of which is equal to ten. All the improved 
methods of teaching arithmetic to children proceed 
upon a knowledge of this fact. All who wish to 
carry the child's mind along with them in learning 
arithmetic ; all who (as Dr. Biber in his remarkable 
Lectures on Education expresses it) wish to teach 
numbers, and not mere ciphers — now teach it through 
the evidence of the senses, in the manner we have 
described*.

We may, if we please, call the proposition ^^ Three 
is two and one," a definition of the number three, and 
assert that arithmetic, as it has been asserted that 
geometry, is a science founded upon definitions. But 
they are definitions in the geometrical sense, not the 
logical ; asserting not the meaning of a term only, 
but along with it an observed matter of feet The 
proposition, *' A circle is a figure bounded by a line 
which has all its points equally distant from a point 
within it,'' is called the definition of a circle ; but the 
proposition from which so many consequences follow, 
and which is really a first principle of geometry, is, 
that figures answering to this description exist. And 
thus we may call, ** Three is two and one," a defini- 
tion of three ; but the calculations which depend upon 
that proposition do not follow from the definition 
itself, but from an arithmetical theorem presupposed 
in it, namely, that collections of objects exist, which 
while they impress the senses thus, ^^, may be sepa- 
rated into two parts, thus, co o. This proposition 
being granted, we term all such parcels Threes, after 
which the enunciation of the above-mentioned phy- 
sical fact will serve also for a definition of the word 
Three. 

The Science of Number is thus no exception to the 
conclusion we previously arrived at, that the processes 
even of deductive sciences are altogether inductive, 
and that their first principles are generalisations from 
experience. It remains to be examined whether this 



preneral properties or its axioms to be of necessity inductively con- 
cluded from the consideration of particular cases. And surely this 
is the way in which children do acquire their knowledge of number, 
and in which they learn its axioms. The apples and the marbles 
are put in requisition, and through the multitude of gingerbread 
nuts their ideas acquire cleaniess, precision, and generality."

science resembles geometry in the further circum- 
stance, that some of its inductions are not exactly 
true ; and that the peculiar certainty ascribed to it> 
on account of which its propositions are called Neces- 
sary Truths, is fictitious and hypothetical, being true 
in no other sense than that those propositions neces- 
sarily follow from the hypothesis of the truth of 
premisses which are avowedly mere approximations 
to truth. 

$ 3. The inductions of arithmetic are of two sorts : 
first, those which we have just expounded, such as 
One and one are two, Two and one are three, &c., 
which may be called the definitions of the various 
numbers, in the improper or geometrical sense of the 
word Definition ; and secondly, the two following 
axioms : The sums of equals are equal, The differ- 
ences of equals are equal. These two are sufficient ; 
for the corresponding propositions respecting imequals 
may be proved from these, by the process well known 
to mathematicians under the name of reductio ad 
absurdum. 

These axioms, and likewise the so-called defini- 
tions, are, as already shown, results of induction; true 
of all objects whatever, and, as it may seem, exactly 
true, without any hypothetical assumption of unquali- 
fied truth where an approximation to it is all that 
exists. The conclusions, therefore, it will naturally 
be inferred, are exactly true, and the science of 
nimiber is an exception to other demonstrative sci- 
ences in this, that the absolute certainty which is 
predicable of its demonstrations is independent of all 
hypothesis. 

On more accurate investigation, however, it will 
be found that, even in this casfe, there is one hjrpo- 
voL. I. Digitized^ Google 



338 REASONING. 

thetical element in the ratiocination. In all proposi- 
tions concerning numbers, a condition is implied, 
without which none of them would be true ; and that 
condition is an assumption which may be false. The 
condition is, that 1 = 1; that all the numbers are 
numbers of the same or of equal units. Let this be 
doubtful, and not one of the propositions of arithmetic 
will hold true. How can we know that one pound 
and one pound make two pounds, if one of the pounds 
may be troy, and the other avoirdupois ? They may 
not make two pounds of either, or of any weight. 
How can we know that a forty-horse power is always 
equal to itself, unless we assimie that all horses are of 
equal strength ? It is certain that 1 is always equal 
in number to 1; and where the mere number of 
objects, or of the parts of an object, without suppos- 
ing them to be equivalent in any other respect, is all 
that is material, the conclusions of arithmetic, so far 
as they go to that alone, are true without mixture of 
hjrpothesis. There are a few suph cases ; as, for 
instance, an inquiry into the amoimt of population of 
any country. It is indifferent to that inquiry whether 
they are grown people or children, strong or weak, 
tall or short ; the only thing we want to ascertain is 
their number. But whenever, from equality or ine- 
quality of number, equality or inequality in any other 
respect is to be inferred, arithmetic carried into such 
inquiries becomes as hypothetical a science as geo- 
metry. All units must be assumed to be equal in 
that other respect ; and this is never precisely true, 
for one pound weight is not exactly equal to anodier, 
nor one mile's length to another; a nicer balance, or 
more accimtte measuring instruments, would always 
detect some difference. 

What is commonly called mathematical certainty, 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



DEMONSTRATION, AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 339 

therefore, which comprises the twofold conception of 
unconditional truth and perfect accuracy, is not an 
attribute of all mathematical truths, but of those only 
which relate to pure Number, as distinguished from 
Quantity in the more enlarged sense ; and only so long 
as we abstain from supposing that the numbers are a 
precise index to actual quantities. The certainty 
usually ascribed to the conclasions of geometry, and 
even to those of mechanics, is nothing whatever but 
certainty of inference. We can have full assurance 
of particular results under particular suppositions, but 
we can not have the same assurance that these sup- 
positions are accurately true, nor that they include 
all the data which may exercise an influence over the 
result in any given instance. 

§ 4. It appears, therefore, that the method of all 
Deductive Sciences is hypothetical. They proceed by 
tracing the consequences of certain assumptions; 
leaving for separate consideration whether the assump- 
tions are true or not, and if not exactly true, whether 
they are a sufficiently near approximation to the truth. 
The reason is obvious. Since it is only in questions 
of pure number that the assumptions are exactly true, 
and even there, only so long as no conclusions except 
purely numerical ones are to be foimded upon them ; 
it must, in all other cases of deductive investigation, 
form a part of the inquiry, to determine how much 
the assumptions want of being exactly true in the case 
in hand. This is generally a matter of observation, 
to be repeated in every fresh case ; or if it has to be 
settled by argument instead of observation, may 
require, in every diffisrent case, difierent evidence, and 
present every degree of difficulty from the lowest to 
the highest. But the other part of the process — 

DigA^ Google 



340 REASONING. 

namely, to determine what else may be concluded if 
we find, and in proportion as we find, the assumptions 
to be true — may be performed once for all, and the 
results held ready to be employed as the occasions 
turn up for use. We thus do all beforehand that can 
be so done, and leave the least possible work to be 
performed when cases arise and press for a decision. 
This inquiry into the inferences which can be drawn 
from assumptions, is what properly constitutes Demon- 
strative Science. 

It is of course quite as practicable to arrive at 
new conclusions from facts assumed, as from facts 
observed; from fictitious, as from real, inductions. 
Deduction, as we have seen, consists of a series of 
inferences in this form : a is a mark of 6, 6 of c, c of 
d, therefore a is a mark of d, which last may be a 
truth inaccessible to direct observation. In like man- 
ner it is allowable to say. Suppose that a were a mark 
of 6, b of c, and c of d, a would be a mark of d, which 
last conclusion was not thought of by those who laid 
down the premisses. A system of propositions as 
complicated as geometry might be deduced from 
assumptions which are false; as was done by Ptolemy, 
Descartes, and others, in their attempts to explain 
synthetically the phenomena of the solar system, on 
the supposition that the apparent motions of the 
heavenly bodies were the real motions, or were pro- 
duced in some way more or less different from the 
true one. Sometimes the same thing is knowingly 
done, for the purpose of showing the falsity of the 
assumption ; which is called a reductio ad absurdum. 
In such cases, the reasoning is as follows: a is a mark 
of 6, and 6 of c; now if c were also a mark of d, a would 
be a mark of d; but d is known to be a mark of the 
absence of a; consequently a would be a mark of its

DEMONSTRATION^ AND NECESSARY TRUTHS. 341 

own absence, which is a contradiction ; therefore c is 
not a mark of d. 

$ 5. It has even been held by some philosophers, 
that all ratiocination rests in the last resort upon a 
reductio ad absurdum ; since the way to enforce assent 
to it, in case of obscurity, would be to show that if 
the conclusion be denied we must deny some one at 
least of the premisses, which, as they are all supposed 
true, would be a contradiction. And, in accordance 
with this, many have thought that the peculiar nature 
of the evidence of ratiocination consisted in the impos- 
sibility of admitting the premisses aud rejecting the 
conclusion without a contradiction in terms. This 
theory, however, is quite inadmissible as an explana- 
tion of the groimds on which ratiocination itself rests. 
If any one denies the conclusion notwithstanding his 
admission of the premisses, he is not involved in any 
direct and express contradiction until he is compelled 
to deny some premiss ; and he can only be forced to 
do this by a reductio ad abaurdum^ that is, by another 
ratiocination : now, if he denies the validity of the 
reasoning process itself, he can no more be forced to 
assent to the second syllogism than to the first. In 
truth, therefore, no one is ever forced to a contradic- 
tion in terms : he can only be forced to a contradic- 
tion (or rather an infringement) of the fundamental 
maxim of ratiocination, namely, that whatever has a 
mark, has what it is a mark of ; or, (in the case of 
universal propositions) that whatever is a mark of 
a thing, is a mark of whatever else that thing is a 
mark of. For in the case of every correct argument, 
as soon as thrown into the syllogistic form, it is 
evident without the aid of any other syllogism, that 
he who, admitting the premisses, fails to draw

342 REASONING. 

the conclusion, does not conform to the above 
axiom. 

Without attaching exaggerated importance to the 
distinction now drawn, I think it enables us to charac- 
terise in a more accurate manner than is usually done, 
the nature of demonstrative evidence and of logical 
necessity. That is necessary, from which to withhold 
our assent would be to violate the above axiom. And 
since the axiom can only be violated by assenting to 
premisses and rejecting a legitimate conclusion from 
them, nothing is necessary except the connexion 
between a conclusion and premisses; ofwhidi doc- 
trine, the whole of this and the preceding chapter are 
submitted as the proof. 

We have now proceeded as far in the theory 
of Deduction as we can advance in the present stage 
of our inquiry. Any fturthcr insight into the subject 
requires that the foundation shall have been laid of 
the philosophic theory of Induction itself; in which 
theory that of deduction, as a mode of induction, 
which we have now shown it to be, will assume 
spontaneously the place which belongs to it, and will 
receive its share of whatever light may be thrown 
upon the great intellectual operation of which it forms 
so important a part. 

We here, therefore, close the Second Book. The 
theory of Induction, in the most comprehensive sense 
of the term, will form the subject of the Third.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON INDUCTION 
IN GENERAL. 

$ 1. The portion ofthe present inquiry upon which 
we are now about to enter, may be considered as the 
principal, both from its surpassing in intricacy all the 
other branches, and because it relates to a process 
which has been shown in the preceding Book to be 
that in which the Investigation of Nature essentially 
consists. We have found that all Inference, conse- 
quently all Proof, and all discovery of truths not self- 
evident, consists of inductions, and the interpretation 
of inductions : that all our knowledge, not intuitive, 
comes to us exclusively from that source. What 
Induction is, therefore, and what conditions render it 
legitimate, cannot but be deemed the main question 
of the science of logic — the question which includes 
all others. It is, however, one which professed 
writers on logic have almost entirely passed over. 
The generalities of the subject have not been alto- 
gether neglected by metaphysicians ; but, for want of 
sufficient acquaintance with the processes by which 
science has actually succeeded in establishing general 
truths^ their analysis of the inductive operation, even 
when unexceptionable as to correctness, has not been 
specific enough to be made the foundation of practical 
rales, which might be for induction itself what the 
rules of the syllogism are for the interpretation of 
induction: while those by whom physical science has 
been carried to its present high state of improvement— 
and who, to arrive at a complete theory of the process,

needed only to generalize, and adapt to all varieties 
of problems, the methods which they themselves 
employed in their habitual pursuits — ^never until very 
lately made any serious attempt to philosophize on 
the subject, nor regarded the mode in which they 
arrived at their conclusions as deserving of study, 
independently of the conclusions themselves. 

Although, for these reasons, there is not yet 
extant a body of Inductive Logic, scientifically con- 
structed; the materials for its construction exist, 
widely scattered, but abundant: and the selection and 
arrangement of those materials is a task with which 
intellects of the highest order, possessed of the 
necessary acquirements, have at length consented to 
occupy themselves. Within a few years three writers, 
profoundly versed in every branch of physical science, 
and not unaccustomed to carry their speculations into 
still higher regions of knowledge, have made attempts, 
of unequal but all of very great merit, towards the 
creation of a Philosophy of Induction: Sir John 
Herschel, in his Discourse on the Study of Natural 
Philosophy; Mr. Whewell, in his History and Philo- 
sophy of the Inductive Sciences ; and, greatest of all, 
M. Auguste Comte, in his Cours de Philosophic 
Positive, a work which only requires to be better 
known, to place its author in the very highest class 
of European thinkers. That the present writer does 
not consider any of these philosophers, or even all of 
them together, to have entirely accomplished this 
important work, is implied in his attempting to contri- 
bute something farther towards its achievement; but 
with his comparatively imperfect knowledge of the 
various physical sciences, the attempt would have 
been desperate unless the materials had been brought 
together, and had undergone a partial elaboration, by

their more competent hands ; even if he could have 
dispensed with the many important logical ideas and 
principles, for the first suggestion of which he has been 
indebted to one or other of those writers. 

§ 2. For the purposes of the present inquiry, 
Induction may be defined, the operation of discovering 
and proving general propositions. It is true that (as 
already shown) the process of indirectly ascertaining 
individual facts, is as truly inductive as that by which 
we establish general truths. But it is not a different 
kind of induction; it is another form of the very same 
process: since, on the one hand, generals are but 
collection^ of particulars, definite in kind but inde- 
finite in number ; and on the other hand, whenever 
the evidence which we derive from observation of 
known cases justifies us in drawing an inference 
respecting even one unknown case, we should on 
the same evidence be justified in drawing a similar 
inference with respect to a whole class of cases. The 
inference either does not hold at all, or it holds in all 
cases of a certain description ; in all cases which, in 
certain definable respects^ resemble those we have 
obseiTcd. 

If these remarks are just; if the principles and 
rules of inference are the same whether we infer 
general propositions or individual facts; it follows 
that a complete logic of the sciences would be also a 
complete logic of practical business and common 
life. Since there is no case of legitimate inference 
from experience, in which the conclusion may not 
legitimately be a general proposition; an analysis 
of the process by which general truths are arrived 
at, is virtually an analysis of all induction whatever. 
Whether we are inquiring into a scientific principle 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



348 INDUCTION. 

or into an individual fact, and whether we proceed 
by experiment or by ratiocination, every step in the 
train of inferences is essentially inductive, and the 
legitimacy of the induction depends in both cases 
upon the same conditions. 

True it is that in the case of the practical inquirer, 
who is endeavouring to ascertain facts not for the 
purposes of science but for those of business, such 
for instance as the advocate or the judge, the chief 
difficulty is one in which the principles of induction 
will afford him no assistance. It lies not in making 
his inductions but in the selection of them ; in 
choosing from among all general propositions ascer- 
tained to be true, those which furnish him with marks 
by which he may trace whether the given subject 
possesses or not the predicate in question. In arguing 
a doubtful question of fact before a jury, the general 
propositions or principles to which the advocate 
appeals are mostly, in themselves, sufficiently trite, 
and assented to as soon as stated: his skill lies in 
bringing his case under those propositions or prin- 
ciples; in calling to mind such of the known or 
recognised maxims of probability as admit of appli- 
cation to the case in hand, and selecting from among 
them those best adapted to his object. Success is here 
dependent upon natural or acquired sagacity, aided 
by knowledge of the particular subject, and of subjects 
allied with it. Invention, though it can be cultivated, 
cannot be reduced to rule ; there is no science which 
will enable a man to bethink himself of that which 
will suit his purpose. 

But when he h^is thought of something, science 
can tell him whether that which he has thought of 
will suit his purpose or not. The inquirer or arguer 
must be guided by his own knowledge and sagacity 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



INDUCTION IN GENERAL. 349 

in his choice of the inductions out of which he will 
construct his argument. But the validity of the 
argument when constructed, depends upon principles 
and must be tried by tests which are the same for all 
descriptions of inquiries, whether the result be to give 
A an estate, or to enrich science with a new general 
truth. In the one case and in the other, the senses, 
or testimony, must decide on the individual facts; 
the rules of the syllogism will determine whether, 
those facts being supposed correct, the case really 
falls within the formulae of the different inductions 
under which it has been successively brought; and 
finally, ihie legitimacy of the inductions themselves 
must be decided by other rules, and these it is now 
our purpose to investigate. If this third part of the 
operation be, in many of the questions of practical 
life, not the most, but the least arduous portion of it, 
we have seen that this is also the case in some great 
departments of the field of science; in all those 
which are principally deductive, and most of all in 
mathematics; where the inductions themselves are few 
in number, and so obvious and elementary, that they 
seem to stand in no need of the evidence of expe- 
rience, while to combine them so as to prove a given 
theorem or solve a problem, may call for the highest 
powers of invention and contrivance with which our 
species is gifted. 

If the identity of the logical processes which prove 
particular facts and those which establish general 
scientific truths, required any additional confirmation, 
it would be sufficient to consider, that in many 
branches of science single facts have to be proved, as 
well as principles ; facts as completely individual as 
any that are debated in a court of justice ; but which 
are proved in the same manner as the other truths of

the science, and without disturbing in any degree the 
homogeneity of its method. A remarkable example 
of this is afforded by astronomy. The individual facts 
upon which that science grounds its most important 
deductions, such facts as the magnitudes of the bodies 
of the solar system, their distances from one another, 
the figure of the earth, and its rotation, are scarcely 
any of them accessible to our means of direct obser- 
vation: they are proved indirectly, by the aid of 
inductions founded on other facts which we can more 
easily reach. For example, the distance of the moon 
from the earth was determined by a very circuitous 
process. The share which direct observation had in 
the work consisted in ascertaining, at one and the 
same instant, the zenith distances of the moon^ as 
seen from two points very remote from one another 
on the earth's surface. The ascertainment of these 
angular distances ascertained their supplements ; and 
since the angle at the earth's centre subtended by the 
distance between the two places of observation was 
deduciWe by spherical trigonometry from the latitude 
and longitude of those places, the angle at the moon 
subtended by the same line became the fourth angle 
of a quadrilateral of which the other three angles 
were known. The four angles being thus ascertained, 
and two sides of the quadrilateral being radii of the 
earth ; the two remaining sides and the diagonal, or in 
other words, the moon's distance from the two places 
of observation and from the centre of the earth, 
could be ascertained, at least in terms of the earth's 
radius, from elementary theorems of geometry. At 
each step in this demonstration we take in a new 
induction, represented, in the aggregate of its results, 
by a general proposition. 

Not only is the process by which an individual

astronomical fact was thus ascertained, exactly similar 
to those by which the same science establishes its 
general truths, but moreover (as we have shown to 
be the case in all legitimate reasoning) a general pro- 
position might have been concluded instead of a single 
fact. In strictness, indeed, the result of the reason- 
ing is a general proposition; a theorem respecting 
the distance, not of the moon in particular, but of any 
inaccessible object ; showing in what relation that 
distance stands to certain other quantities. And 
although the moon is almost the only heavenly body 
the distance of which from the earth can really be 
thus ascertained, this is merely owing to the acci- 
dental circumstances of the other heavenly bodies, 
which render them incapable of affording such data 
as the application of the theorem requires ; for the 
theorem itself is as true of them as it is of the 
moon. 

We shall fall into no error, then, if in treating of 
Induction, we limit our attention to the establishment 
of general propositions. The principles and rules of 
Induction, as directed to this end, are the principles 
and rules of all Induction ; and the logic of Science 
is the universal Logic, applicable to all inquiries in 
which man can engage, and the test of all the conclu-* 
sions at which he can arrive by inference.

$ 1. Induction, then, is that operation of the 
mind, by which we infer that what we know to be 
true in a particular case or cases, will be true in all 
cases which resemble the former in certain assignable 
respects. In other words, Induction is the process 
by which we conclude that what is true of certain 
individuals of a class is true of the whole class, or 
that what is true at certain times will be true under 
similar circumstances at all times. 

This definition excludes from the meaning of the 
term Induction, various logical operations, to which 
it is not unusual to apply that name. 

Induction, as above defined, is a process of infe- 
rence ; it proceeds from the known to the unknown ; 
and any operation involving no inference, any process 
in which what seems the conclusion is no wider 
than the premisses from which it is drawn, does not 
fall within the meaning of the term. Yet in the 
common books of Logic we find this laid down as the 
most perfect, indeed the only quite perfect, form of 
induction. In those books, every process which sets 
out from a less general and terminates in a more 
general expression, — which admits of being stated in 
the form, " This and that A are B, therefore every A 
is B," — is called an induction, whether anything be 
really concluded or not ; and the induction is asserted 
to be not perfect, unless every single individual of the 
class A is included in the antecedent, or premiss: 
that is, unless what we aflirm of the class, has already

INDUCTIONS IMPROPERLY SO CALLED. 353 

been ascertained to be true of every individual in it, 
so that the nominal conclusion is not really a conclu- 
sion, but a mere reassertion of the premisses. If we 
were to say. All the planets shine by the sun's light, 
from observation of each separate planet, or All the 
Apostles were Jews, because this is true of Peter, 
Paul, John, and every other apostle, — these, and such 
as these^ would, in the phraseology in question, be 
called perfect, and the only perfect, Inductions. This, 
however, is a totally different kind of induction from 
ours; it is no inference from facts known to facts 
unknown, but a mere shorthand registration of facts 
known. The two simulated arguments, which we have 
quoted, are not generalizations; the propositions pur- 
porting to be conclusions from them, are not really 
general propositions. A general proposition is one in 
which the predicate is affirmed or denied of an unlimited 
number of individuals ; namely, all, whether few or 
many, existing or capable of existing, which possess the 
properties connoted by the subject of the proposition. 
" All men are mortal" does not mean all now living, 
but all men past, present, and to come. When the 
signification of the term is limited so as to render 
it a name not for any and every individual falling 
imder a certain general description, but only for each 
of a number of individuals designated as such, and as it 
were coimted off individually, the proposition, though 
it may be general in its language, is no general pro- 
position, but merely that number of singular proposi- 
tions, written in an abridged character. The opera- 
tion may be very useful, as most forms of abridged 
notation are ; but it is no part of the investigation of 
truth, though often bearing an important part in the 
preparation of the materials for that investigation.

§ 2. A second process which requires to be distin- 
guished from Induction, is one to which mathemati- 
cians sometimes give that name : and which so far resem- 
bles Induction properly so called, that the propositions it 
leads to are really general propositions. For example, 
when we have proved, with respect to the circle, that 
a straight Une cannot meet it in more than two points, 
and when the same thing has been successively proved 
of the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola, it may 
be laid down as an universal property of the sections 
of the cone. In this example there is no induction, 
because there is no inference : the conclusion is a 
mere summing up of what was asserted in the various 
propositions from which it is drawn. A case some- 
what, though not altogether, similar, is the proof of a 
geometrical theorem by means of a diagram. Whether 
the diagram be on paper or only in the imagination, 
the demonstration (as we formerly observed*) does 
not prove directly the general theorem ; it proves only 
that the conclusion, which the theorem asserts gene- 
rally, is true of the particular triangle or circle exhi- 
bited in the diagram : but since we perceive that in 
the same way in which we have proved it of that 
circle, it might also be proved of any other circle, we 
gather up into one general expression all the singular 
propositions susceptible of being thus proved, and 
embody them in an universal proposition. Having 
shown that the three angles of the triangle ABC 
are together equal to two right angles, we conclude 
that this is true of every other triangle, not because 
it is true of A B C, but for the same reason which 
proved it to be true of ABC. If this were to be

called Induction, an appropriate name for it would be, 
Induction by parity of reasoning. But the term can- 
not properly belong to it ; the characteristic quality 
of Induction is wanting, since the truth obtained, 
though really general, is not beUeved on the evidence 
of particular instances. We do not conclude that all 
triangles have the property because some triangles 
have, but from the ulterior demonstrative evidence 
which was the ground of our conviction in the parti- 
cular instances. 

There are nevertheless, in mathematics, some 
examples of so-called induction, in which the conclu- 
sion does bear the appearance of a generalization 
grounded upon some of the particular cases included 
in it. A mathematician, when he has calculated a 
sufficient number of the terms of an algebraical or 
arithmetical series to have ascertained what is called 
the law of the series, does not hesitate to fill up any 
number of the succeeding terms without repeating 
the calculations. But I apprehend he only does so 
when it is apparent from d priori considerations 
(which might be exhibited in the form of demonstra- 
tion) that the mode of formation of the subsequent 
terms, each from that which preceded it, must be 
similar to the formation of the terms which have been 
already calculated. And when the attempt has been 
hazarded without the sanction of such general con- 
siderations, there are instances upon record in which 
it has led to false results, 
r It is said that Newton discovered the binomial 
' theorem by induction ; by raising a binomial succes- 
sively to a certain number of powers, and comparing 
those powers with one another until he detected the 
relation in which the algebraic formula of each power 
stands to the exponent of that power, and to the two

terms of the binomial. The feet is not improbable : 
but a mind like Newton's, which seemed to arrive 
per saltum at principles and conclusions that ordinary 
mathematicians only reached by a succession of steps, 
certainly could not have performed the comparison in 
question without being led by it to the a priori ground 
of the law ; since any one who understands suflBciently 
the nature of multiplication to venture upon multi- 
plying several lines of figures or symbols at one 
operation, cannot but perceive that in raising a bino- 
mial to a power, the coefficients must depend upon 
the laws of permutation and combination: and as 
soon as this is recognised, the theorem is demon- 
strated. Indeed, when once it was seen that the law 
prevailed in a few of the lower powers, its identity 
with the law of permutation would at once suggest 
the considerations which prove it to obtain universally. 
Even, therefore, such cases as these, are but examples 
of what I have called induction by parity of reasoning, 
that is, not really induction, because not involving 
any inference of a general proposition from particular 
instances*. 

$ 3. There remains a third improper use of the 
term Induction, which it is of real importance to clear 
up, because the theory of induction has been, to no 
ordinary degree, confused by it, and because the con- 
fusion is exemplified in the most recent and most 
elaborate treatise on the inductive philosophy which 
exists in our language. The error in question is that

of confounding a mere description of a set of observed 
phenomena^ with an induction from them. ' 

Suppose that a phenomenon consists of parts, and 
that these parts are only capable of being observed 
separately, and as it were piecemeal. When the 
observations have been made, there is a convenience 
(amounting for many purposes to ft necessity) in 
obtaining a representation of the phenomenon as a 
whole, by combining, or, as we may say, piecing these 
detached fragments together. A navigator sailing in 
the midst of the ocean discovers land : he cannot at 
first, or by any one observation, determine whether 
it is a continent or an island ; but he coasts along it, 
and after a few days, finds himself to have sailed 
completely round it : he then pronounces it an island. 
Now there was no particular time or place of observa- 
tion at which he could perceive that this land was 
entirely surrounded by water : he ascertained the feet 
by a succession of partial observations, and then 
selected a general expression which summed up in 
two or three words the whole of what he so observed. 
But is there anjrthing of the nature of an induction in 
this process? Did he infer anything that had not 
been observed, from something else which had? 
Certainly not. That the land in question is an island, 
is not an inference from the partial facts which the 
navigator saw in the course of his circumnavigation ; 
it is the facts themselves ; it is a summary of those 
facts ; the description of a complex fact, to which 
those simpler ones are as the parts of a whole. 

Now there is no diflFerence in kind between this 
simple operation, and that by which Kepler ascer- 
tained the nature of the planetary orbits : and Kep- 
ler 's operation, all at least that was characteristic in

358 INDUCTION. 

it, was not more an inductive act than that of our 
supposed navigator. 

The object of Kepler was to determine the real 
path described by each of the planets, or let us say 
the planet Mars, (for it was of that body that he first 
estabUshed two of the three great astronomical truths 
which bear his name). To do this there was no other 
mode than that of direct observation : and all which 
observation could do was to ascertain a great number 
of the successive places of the planet ; or rather, of 
its apparent places. That the planet occupied succes- 
sively all these positions, or at all events, positions 
which produced the same impressions on the eye, and 
that it passed from one of these to another insensibly, 
and without any apparent breach of continuity ; thus 
much the senses, with the aid of the proper instru- 
ments, could ascertain. What Kepler did more than 
this, was to find what sort of a curve these difierent 
points would make, supposing them to be all joined 
together. He expressed the whole series of the 
observed places of Mars by what Mr. Whewell calls 
the general conception of an ellipse. This operation 
was far from being as easy as that of the navigator 
who expressed the series of his observations on suc- 
cessive points of the coast by the general conception 
of an island. But it is the very same sort of opera- 
tion ; and if the one is not an induction but a descrip- 
tion, this must also be true of the other. 

To avoid misapprehension, we must remark that 
Kepler, in one respect, performed a real act of induc- 
tion ; namely, in concluding that because the observed 
places of Mars were correctly represented by points 
in an imaginary ellipse, therefore Mars would con- 
tinue to revolve in that same elhpse; and even in

concluding that the position of the planet during the 
time which intervened between two observations, must 
have coincided with the intermediate pomts of the 
curve. But this really inductive operation requires 
to be carefully distinguished from the mere act of 
bringing the facts actually observed under a general 
description. So distinct are these two operations, 
that the one might have been performed without the 
other. Men might and did make correct inductions 
concerning the heavenly motions, before they had 
obtained correct general descriptions of them. It 
was known that the planets always moved in the 
same paths, long before it had been ascertained that 
those paths were ellipses. Men early remarked 
that the same set of apparent positions returned peri- 
odically. When they obtained a new description of 
the phenomenon, they did not necessarily make any 
further induction, nor (which is the true test of a 
new general truth) add anything to the power of 
prediction which they already possessed. 

$ 4. The descriptive operation which enables a 
number of details to be summed up in a single propo- 
sition, Mr. Whewell, by an aptly-chosen expression, 
has termed the Colligation of Facts *. In most of his 
observations concerning that mental process I fully 
agree, and would gladly transfer all that portion of 
his book into my own pages. I only think him mis- 
taken in setting up this kind of operation, which 
according to the old and received meaning of the term, 
is not induction at all, as the type of induction gene- 
rally; and laying down, throughout his work, as prin- 
ciples of induction, the principles of mere colligation.

Mr. Whewell maintains that the general propo- 
sition which binds together the particular facts and 
makes them, as it were, one fact, is not the mere 
sum of those facts, but something more, since 
there is introduced a conception of the mind, which 
did not exist in the facts themselves. **The par- 
ticular facts," says he*, " are not^ merely brought 
together, but there is a new element added to 
the combination by the very act of thought by 
which they are combined. . . When the Greeks, 
after long observing the motions of the planets, saw 
that these motions might be rightly considered as 
produced by the motion of one wheel revolving in 
the inside of another wheel, these wheels were crea- 
tions of their minds, added to the facts which they 
perceived by sense. And even if the wheels were no 
longer supposed to be material, but were reduced to 
mere geometrical spheres or circles, they were not the 
less products of the mind alone^ — something addi* 
tional to the facts observed. The same is the case in 
all other discoveries. The facts are known, but they 
are insulated and unconnected, till the discoverer 
suppUes from his own store a principle of connexion. 
The pearls are there, but they will not hang together 
till some one provides the string.'' 

That a conception of the mind is introduced is 
indeed most certain, and Mr. Whewell has rightly 
stated elsewhere, that to hit upon the right conception 
is often a far more difficult, and more meritorious 
achievement, than to prove its applicability when 
obtained. But a conception implies, and corresponds 
to, something conceived : and although the conception

INDUCTIONS IMPROPERLY SO CALLED. 361 

itself is Dot in the facts, but in our mind, it must be a 
conception of something which really is in the facts, 
some property which they actually possess, and which 
they would manifest to our senses, if our senses were 
able to take cognizance of them. If, for instance, 
the planet left behind it in space a visible track, and 
if the observer were in a fixed position at such a 
distance above the plane of the orbit as would enable 
him to see the whole of it at once, he would see it to 
be an ellipse ; and if gifted with appropriate instru- 
ments, and powers of locomotion, he could prove it to 
be such by measuring its diflferent dimensions. These 
things are indeed impossible to us, but not impossible 
in themselves ; if they were so, Kepler's law could 
not be true. 

Subject to the indispensable condition which has 
just been stated, I cannot perceive that the part which 
conceptions have in the operation of studying facts, 
has ever been overlooked or undervalued as Mr. 
Whewell supposes it has. No one ever disputed 
that in order to reason about anything we must have 
a conception of it ; or that when we include a multi- 
tude of things under a general expression, there is 
implied in the expression a conception of something 
common to those things. But it by no means follows 
that the conception is necessarily pre-existent, or 
constructed by the mind out of its own materials. 
If the facts are rightly classed under the conception, it 
is because there is in the facts themselves something 
of which the conception is itself a copy; and which 
if we cannot directly perceive, it is because of the 
limited power of our organs, and not because the 
thing itself is not there. The conception itself is 
often obtained by abstraction from the very facts 
which, in Mr. Whewell's language, it is afterwards 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



362 INDUCTION. 

called in to connect. This, Mr. Whewell himself 
admits, when he observes, (which he does on several 
occasions) how great a service would be rendered to 
the science of physiology by the philosopher **who 
should establish a precise, tenable, and consistent 
conception of life*." Such a conception can only be 
abstracted from the phenomena of life itself; from the 
very facts which it is put in requisition to connect. 
In other cases (no doubt) instead of collecting the 
conception from the very phenomena which we are 
attempting to colhgate, we select it from among those 
which have been previously collected by abstraction 
from other facts. In the instance of Kepler's laws, the 
latter was the case. The facts being out of the reach 
of being observed, in any such manner as would have 
enabled the senses to identify directly the path of the 
planet, the conception requisite for framing a general 
description of that path could not be collected by 
abstraction from the observations themselves; the 
mind had to supply hypothetically, from among the 
conceptions it had obtained from other portions of its 
experience, some one which would correctly represent 
the series of the observed facts. It had to frame a 
supposition respecting the general course of the 
phenomenon, and ask itself, If this be the general 
description, what will the details be? and then com- 
pare these with the details actually observed. If they 
agreed, the hypothesis would serve for a description 
of the phenomenon : if not, it was necessarily aban- 
doned, and another tried. It is such a case as this 
which gives colour to the doctrine that the mind, in 
framing the descriptions, adds something of its own 
which it does not find in the facts.

Yet it is a fact, surely, that the planet does 
describe an ellipse ; and a fact which we could see, if 
we had adequate visual organs and a suitable position. 
Not having these advantages, but possessing the 
conception of an elUpse, or (to express the meaning 
in less technical language) knowing what an ellipse 
was, Kepler tried whether the observed places of the 
planet were consistent with such a path. He found 
they were so; and he, consequently, asserted as a fact 
that the planet moved in an ellipse. But this fact, 
which Kepler did not add to, but found in, the 
motions of the planet, namely, that it occupied in 
succession the various points in the circumference of 
a given ellipse, was the very fact, the separate parts 
of which had been separately observed; it was the 
sum of the different observations. It superadded 
nothing to the particular facts which it served to bind 
together : except, indeed, the knowledge that a re^m- 
blance existed between the planetary orbit and other 
ellipses; an accession the nature and amount of 
which will be fully considered hereafter*. 

Having stated this fundamental difference between 
my views and those of Mr. Whewell, I must add, that 
his account of the manner in which a conception is 
selected, suitable to fexpress the facts, appears to me 
perfectly just. The experience of all thinkers will, I 
believe, testify that the process is tentative; that it con- 
sists of a succession of guesses ; many being rejected, 
until one at last occurs fit to be chosen. We know 
from Kepler himself that before hitting upon the "con- 
ception '* of an ellipse, he tried nineteen other imagi- 
nary paths, which, finding them inconsistent with the 
observations, he was obUged to reject. But as Mr.

364 INDUCTION. 

Whewell truly says, the successful hypothesis, although 
a guess, ought not to be called a lucky, but a skilful 
guess. The guesses which serve to give mental imity 
and wholeness to a chaos of scattered particulars^ are 
accidents which occur to no minds but those abound- 
ing in knowledge and disciplined in scientific combi- 
nations. 

How far this tentative method, so indispensable as 
a means to the colligation of facts for purposes of 
description, admits of application to Induction itself, 
and what functions belong to it in that department, 
will be considered in the chapter of the present Book 
which relates to H3rpotheses. On the present occasion 
we have chiefly to distinguish this process of colliga- 
tion from Induction properly so called : and that the 
distinction may be made clearer, it is well to advert to 
a curious and interesting remark of Mr. Whewell, 
which is as strikingly true of the former operation, as 
it is unequivocally false of the latter. 

In different stages of the progress of knowledge, 
philosophers have employed, for the colligation of the 
same order of facts, different conceptions. TTie early 
and rude observations of the heavenly bodies, in which 
minute precision was neither attained nor sought, 
presented nothing inconsistent with the representation 
of the path of a planet as an exact circle, having the 
earth for its centre. As observations increased in 
accuracy, and facts were disclosed which were not 
reconcileable with this simple supposition; for the 
colUgation of those additional facts, the supposition 
was varied; and varied again and again as facts 
became more numerous and precise. The earth was 
removed from the centre to some other point within 
the circle ; the planet was supposed to revolve in a 
smaller circle called an epicycle, round an imaginary

INDUCTIONS IMPROPERLY SO CALLED. 365 

point which revolved in a circle round the earth : in 
proportion as observation elicited fresh facts contra- 
dictory to these representations, other epicycles and 
other excentrics were added, producing additional 
complication; until at last Kepler swept all these 
circles away, and substituted the conception of an 
exact ellipse. Even this is found not to represent 
with complete correctness the accurate observations 
of the present day, which disclose many slight devia- 
tions from an orbit exactly elliptical. Now Mr. 
WheweU has remarked that these successive general 
expressions, though apparently so conflicting, were 
all correct : they all answered the purpose of colliga- 
tion : they all enabled the mind to represent to itself 
with feciUty, and by a simultaneous glance, the whole 
body of facts at that time ascertained; each in its turn 
served as a correct description of the phenomena, so 
far as the senses had up to that time taken cognizance 
of them. If a necessity afterwards arose for discarding 
one of these general descriptions of the planet^s orbits 
and framing a different imaginary line, by which to 
express the series of observed positions, it was 
because a number of new facts had now been added, 
which it was neccessary to combine with the old facts 
into one general description. But this did not affect 
the correctness of the former expression, considered 
as a general statement of the only facts which it was 
intended to represent. And so true is this, that, as is 
well remarked by M. Comte, these ancient generali- 
zations, even the rudest and most imperfect of them, 
that of uniform movement in a circle, are so far from 
being entirely false, that they are even now habitually 
employed by astronomers when only a rough approxi- 
mation to correctness is required. " L'astronomie

theses ; ce qui nous permet d'employer sans scrupule,

geuse*." 

Mr. WhewdFs remark, therefore, is as just as it 
is interesting. Successive expressions for the colli- 
gation of observed facts, or, in other words, successive 
descriptions of a phenomenon as a whole, which has 
been observed only in parts, may, though conflicting, 
be all correct as far as they go. But it would surely 
be absurd to assert this of conflicting inductions. 

The philosophic study of facts may be undertaken 
for three different purposes : the simple description of 
the facts ; their explanation ; or their prediction : 
meaning by prediction, the determination of the 
conditions under which similar facts may be expected 
again to occur. To the first of these three operations 
the name of Induction does not properly belong : to 
the other two it does. Now, Mr. Whewell's observa- 
tion is true of the first alone. Considered as a mere 
description, the circular theory of the heavenly 
motions represents perfectly well their general fea- 
tures ; and by adding epicycles without limit, those 
motions, even as now known to us, might be 
expressed with any degree of accuracy that might be 
required. The only real advantage of the elliptical 
theory, as a mere description, would be its simplicity,

and the consequent facility of conceiving it and 
reasoning about it : for it would not really be more 
true than the other. Different descriptions, there- 
fore, may be all true: but not, surely, different 
explanations. The doctrine that the heavenly bodies 
moved by a virtue inherent in their celestial nature ; 
the doctrine that they were moved by impact, (wliich 
led to the hypothesis of vortices as the only impelling 
force capable of whirling bodies in circles,) and the 
Newtonian doctrine, that they are moved by the 
composition of a centripetal with an original projec- 
tile force; all these are explanations^ collected by 
real induction from supposed parallel cases ; and they 
were all successively received by philosophers, as 
scientific truths on the subject of the heavenly bodies. 
Can it be said of these, as we said of the different 
descriptions, that they are all true as far as they go ? 
Is it not clear that one only can be true in any 
degree, and the other two must be altogether false ? 
So much for explanations : let us now compare dif- 
ferent predictions : the first, that eclipses will occur 
whenever one planet or sateUite is so situated as to 
cast its shadow upon another ; the second, that they 
will occur whenever some great calamity is impending 
over mankind. Do these two doctrines only differ in 
the degree of their truth, as expressing real facts 
with imequal degrees of accuracy? Assuredly the 
one is true, and the other absolutely false. 

In every way, therefore, it is evident that when 
Mr. Whewell explains induction as the colligation of 
facts by means of appropriate conceptions, that is, 
conceptions which will really express them, he con- 
founds mere description of the observed facts with 
inference from those facts, and ascribes to the latter 
what is a characteristic property of the former.

368 INDUCTION. 

There is, however, between Colligation and Induc- 
tion, a real correlation, which it is important to con- 
ceive correctly. Colligation is not always induction ; 
but induction is always colligation. The assertion 
that the planets move in ellipses, was but a mode of 
representing observed facts ; it was but a colligation; 
while the assertion that they are drawn, or tend, 
towards the sun, was the statement of a new fact, 
inferred by induction. But the induction, once made, 
accompUshes the purposes of colligation likewise. 
It brings the same facts, which Kepler had connected 
by his conception of an ellipse, under the additional 
conception of bodies acted upon by a central force, 
and serves therefore as a new bond of connexion for 
those facts ; a new principle for their classification. 

Moreover, that general description, which is 
improperly confoimded with induction, is neverthe- 
less a necessary preparation for induction; no less 
necessary than correct observation of the facts them- 
selves. Without the previous colligation of detached 
observations by means of one general conception, we 
could never have obtained any basis for an induction, 
except in the case of phenomena of very limited 
compass. We should not be able to affirm any 
predicates at all, of a subject incapable of being 
observed otherwise than piecemeal : much less could 
we extend those predicates by induction to other 
similar subjects. Induction, therefore, always pre- 
supposes, not only that the necessary observations are 
made with the necessary accuracy, but also that the 
results of these observations are, so far as practicable, 
connected together by general descriptions, enabling 
the mind to represent to itself as wholes whatever 
phenomena are capable of being so represented. 

To suppose, however, that nothing more is

required from the conception than that it shall serve 
to connect the observations, would be to substitute 
hypothesis for theory and imagination for proof. The 
connecting link must be some character which recUly 
exists in the facts themselves, and which would 
manifest itself therein if the conditions could be 
realized which our organs of sense require. 

What more may be usefully said on the subject of 
Colligation, or of tJhe correlative expression invented 
by Mr. Whewell, the Exphcation of Conceptions, and 
generally on the subject of ideas and mental repre- 
sentations as connected with the study of facts, will 
find a more appropriate place in the Fourth Book, on 
the Operations Subsidiary to Induction : to which the 
reader must refer for the removal of any diflBculty 
which the present discussion may have left.

OF THE GROUND OF INDUCTION. 

$ 1. Induction properly so called, as distin- 
guished from those mental operations, sometimes 
thou^ improperiy designated by the name, which I 
have attempted in the preceding chapter to charac- 
terise, may, then, be summarily defined as Oeneraliza- 
tion from Experience. It consists in inferring fiH>m 
some individual instances in which a phenomenon is 
observed to occur, that it occurs in all instances of 
a certain class; namely, in all which resemble the 
former, in what are regarded as the material circum- 
stances. 

In what way the material circumstances are to be 
distinguished from those which are immaterial, or 
why some of the circumstances are material and 
others not so, we are not yet ready to point out. We 
must first observe, that there is a principle implied in 
the very statement of what Induction is ; an assump- 
tion with regard to the course of nature and the 
order of the universe : namely, that there are such 
things in nature as parallel cases ; that what happens 
once, will, under a sufficient degree of similarity of 
circumstances, happen again> and not only again, but 
always. This, I say, is an assumption, involved in 
every case of induction. And, if we consult the actual 
course of nature^ we find that the assumption is 
warranted ; the fact is so. The imiverse, we find, is 
so constituted, that whatever is true in any one case, 
is true in all cases of a certain description ; the only 
difficiilty is, to find what description.

GROUND or INDUCTION. 371 

This universal fact, which is our warrant for all 
inference from experience, has been described by dif- 
ferent philosophers in different forms of language: 
that the course of nature is uniform ; that the universe 
is governed by general laws ; and the like. One of 
the most usual of these modes of expression, but also 
one of the most inadequate, is that which has been 
brought into familiar use by the metaphysicians of the 
school of Reid and Stewart. The disposition of the 
human mind to generalize from experience, — a pro- 
pensity considered by these philosophers as an iDstinct 
of our nature, — they usually describe under the name 
of '' our intuitive conviction that the future will re- 
semble the past." Now it has been well pointed 
out by Mr. Bailejr*, that (whether the tendency be 
or not an original and ultimate element of our 
nature). Time, in its modifications of past, present^ 
and future, has no concern either with the belief itself, 
or with the grounds of it. We believe that fire will 
bum to-morrow, because it burned to-day and yester- 
day ; but we believe, on precisely the same grounds, 
that it burned before we were bom, and that it bums 
this very day in Cochin-China. It is not from the 
past to the future, as past and future, that we infer, 
but from the known to the unknown; from facts 
observed to facts unobserved; from what we have 
perceived, or been directly conscious of, to what 
has not come within our experience. In this last 
predicament is the whole region of the future; but 
also the vastly greater portion of the present and of 
the past.

it, the proposition that the course of nature is uniform, 
is the fundamental principle, or general axiom, of 
Induction. It would yet be a great error to offer this 
large generalization as any explanation of the induc- 
tive process. On the contrary, I hold it to be itself 
an instance of induction, and induction by no means 
of the most obvious kind. Far from being the first 
induction we make, it is one of the last, or at all 
events one of those which are latest in attaining strict 
philosophical accuracy. As a general maxim, indeed, 
it has scarcely entered into the minds of any but 
philosophers; nor even by them, as we shall have 
many opportunities of remarking, have its extent and 
limits been always very justly conceived. Yet this 
principle, though so far from being our earliest induc- 
tion, must be considered as our warrant for all the 
others, in this sense, that unless it were true, all other 
inductions would be fallacious. And this, as we have 
already seen, is the sole mode in which the general 
propositions which we place at the head of our rea- 
sonings when we throw them into syllogisms, ever 
really contribute to their validity. Archbishop 
Whately has well remarked, that every induction is 
a syllogism with the major premiss suppressed; or 
(as I prefer expressing it), that every induction may 
be thrown into the form of a syllogism, by supplying 
a major premiss. If this be actually done, the prin- 
ciple which we are now considering, that of the 
imiformity of the course of nature, will appear as the 
ultimate major premiss of all inductions ; and will, 
tlierefore, stand to all inductions in the relation in 
which, as has been shown at so much length, the 
major proposition of a syllogism always stands to the 
conclusion ; not contributing at all to prove it, but

GROUND OF INDUCTION. 378 

being a necessary condition of its being proved ; since 
no conclusion is proved for which there cannot be 
found a true major premiss*. 



* From the foot, that every induction may be expressed in the 
form of a syllogism, Archbishop Whately concludes that Induction 
itself is but a peculiar case of ratiocination, and that the universal 
type of all Inference, or Reasoning, is the Syllogism. Our own 
inquiries have led us to a directly opposite result. Instead of re- 
solving Induction into Ratiocination, it has appeared to us that 
Ratiocination is itself resolvable into Induction. The Archbishop's 
theory may, I think, be shown to be fallacious by following out his 
own train of thought. The induction, " John, Peter, Thomas, &c., 
are mortal, therefore all mankind are mortal,^ may, as he justly 
says, be thrown into a syllogism by prefixing as a major premiss 
(what is at any rate a necessary condition of the validity of the 
argument) namely, that whatever is true of John, Peter, Thomas, 
&c., is true of all mankind. So far the case is made out; and Arch- 
bishop Whately (who, endowed with a penetrating and active 
rather than a patient and persevering intellect, seldom fails to cast 
his sounding line to a greater depth than his predecessors, and when 
he has done this, scarcely seems to care whether he reaches tho 
bottom or not) omitted to ask himself the further question. How 
we come by the major premiss? It is not self-evident; nay, in all 
cases of unwarranted generalization, it is not true. How, then, is 
it arrived at? Necessarily either by induction or ratiocination; 
and if by induction, then, on the Archbbhop's principles, it is 
by ratiocination still, that is, by a previous syllogism. This pre- 
vious syllogism it is, therefore, necessary to construct. There is, in 
the long run, only one possible construction : the real proof that 
whatever is true of John, Peter, &c., is true of all mankind, can 
only be, that a different supposition would be inconsistent with the 
uniformity which we know to exist in the course of nature. 
Whether there would be this inconsistency or not, may be a matter 
of long and delicate inquiry; but imless there would, we have no 
sufficient ground for the major of the inductive syllogism. It hence 
appears, that if we throw the whole course of any inductive argu- 
ment into a series of syllogisms, we shall arrive by more or fewer 
steps at an ultimate syllogism, which will have for its major premiss 
the principle, or axiom, of the uniformity of the course of nature. 
Having reached this point, we have the whole field of induction

374 INDUCTION. 

It was not to be expected that in the case of this 
axiom, any more than of other axioms, there should 
be unanimity among philosophers with respect to the 
grounds upon which it is to be received as true. I 
have already stated that I regard it as itself a genera- 
lization from experience. Others hold it to be a 
principle which, antecedently to any verification by 
experience, we are compelled by the constitution of 
our thinking faculty to assume as true. Having so 
recently, and at so much length, combated a similar 
doctrine as apphed to the axioms of mathematics, by 
arguments which are in a great measure applicable to 
the present case, I shall defer the more particular 
discussion of this controverted point in regard to the 



laid out in syllogisms, and every instance of inference from experi- 
ence exhibited as the conclucdon of a ratiocination, except one; but 
that one, unhappily, includes all the rest. Whence came the 
universal major ? What proves to us that nature is governed by 
general laws ? Where are the premisses of the syllogism of which 
that is the conclusion ? Here, at least, is a case of induction which 
canuut be resolved into syllogism. 

And undoubtedly it would be the ideal perfection of Inductive 
Philosophy if all other general truths could be exhibited as con- 
clusions deduced from that widest generalization of all. But such 
a mode of presenting them, however useful in giving coherence and 
systematic unity to our thoughts, would be an inversion of the real 
order of proof. This great generalization must itself have been 
founded on prior generalizations: the obscurer laws of nature were 
discovered by means of it, but the more obvious ones must have 
been understood and assented to as general truths before it was ever 
heard of. We should never have dared to affirm that all pheno- 
mena take place according to general laws, if we had not first arrived, 
in the case of a great multitude of phenomena, at some knowledge 
of the laws themselves; which could be done no otherwise than by 
induction. Archbishop Whately's theory, therefore, implying, as it 
does, the consequence that we never could have had a single well- 
grounded induction unless we had already reached that highest 
generalization, must, I conceive, be regarded as untenable.

ftmdamental axiom of induction, until a more ad* 
vanced period of our inquiry*. At present it is of 
more importance to understand thoroughly the import 
of the axiom itself. For the proposition, that the 
course of nature is uniform, possesses rather the 
brevity suitable to popular, than the precision requi-^ 
site in philosophical, language : its terms require to 
be explained, and a stricter than their ordinary signi- 
fication given to them, before the truth of the asser* 
tion can be admitted. 

^ 2. Every person's consciousness assures him 
that he does not always expect uniformity in the 
course of events ; he does not always believe that the 
unknown will be similar to the known, that the 
future will resemble the past. Nobody believes that 
the succession of rain and fine weather will be the 
same in every future year as in the present. Nobody 
expects to have the same dreams repeated every 
night. On the contrary, everybody mentions it as 
something extraordinary, if the course of nature is 
constant, and resembles itself, in these particulars. 
To look for constancy where constancy is not to be 
expected, as, for instance, that a day which has once 
brought good fortune will always be a fortunate day, 
is justly accounted superstition. 

The course of nature, in truth, is not only uni- 
form, it is also infinitely various. Some phenomena 
are always seen to recur in the very same combina- 
tions in which we met with them at first; others seem 
altogether capricious ; while some, which we had been 
accustomed to regard as bound down exclusively to a 
particular set of combinations, we imexpectedly find

detached from some of the elements with which we 
had hitherto found them conjoined, and united to 
others of quite a contrary description. To an inha- 
bitant of Central Africa, fifty years ago, no feet pro- 
bably appeared to rest upon more uniform experience 
than this, that all human beings are black. To 
Europeans, not many years ago, the proposition, All 
swans are white, appeared an equally unequivocal 
instance of uniformity in the course of nature. Fur- 
ther experience has proved to both that they were 
mistaken; but they had to wait fifty centuries for 
this experience. During that long time, mankind 
beUeved in an uniformity of the course of nature 
where no such uniformity really existed. 

According to the notion which the ancients enter- 
tained of induction, the foregoing were cases of as 
legitimate inference as any inductions whatever. In 
these two instances, in which, the conclusion being 
false, the ground of inference must have been insuffi- 
cient, there was, nevertheless, as much ground for it 
as this conception of induction admitted of. The 
induction of the ancients has been well described by 
Bacon, under the name of " Inductio per enumera- 
tionem simplicem, ubi non reperitur instantia contra- 
dictoria." It consists in ascribing the character of 
general truths to all propositions which are true in 
every instance that we happen to know of. This is 
the kind of induction, if it deserves the name, which 
is natural to the mind when unaccustomed to scien- 
tific methods. The tendency, which some call an 
instinct, and which others account for by association, 
to infer the future from the past, the known from the 
unknown, is simply a habit of expecting that what 
has been found true once or several times, and never 
yet found false, will be found true again. Whether

the instances are few or many, conclusive or incon- 
clusive, does not much affect the matter: these are 
considerations which occur only on reflexion : the 
unprompted tendency of the mind is to generalize its 
experience, provided this points all in one direction ; 
provided no other experience of a conflicting character 
comes unsought. The notion of seeking it, of expe- 
rimenting for it, of interrogating nature (to use 
Bacon's expression,) is of much later growth. The 
observation of nature, by uncultivated intellects, is 
purely passive: they take the facts which present 
themselves, without taking the trouble of searching 
for more: it is a superior mind only which asks 
itself what facts are needed to enable it to come to a 
sure conclusion, and then looks out for these. 

But although we have always a propensity to 
generalize from unvarying experience, we are not 
always warranted in doing so. Before we can be at 
liberty to conclude that something is universally true 
because we have never known an instance to the 
contrary, it must be proved to us that if there were 
in nature any instances to the contrary, we should 
have known of them. This assurance, in the great 
majority of cases, we cannot have, or can have only in 
a very moderate degree. The possibility of having 
it, is the foundation on which we shall see hereafter 
that induction by simple enumeration may in some 
remarkable cases amoimt to fiill proof*. No such 
assurance, however, can be had, on any of the ordi- 
nary subjects of scientific inquiry. Popular notions 
are usually founded upon induction by simple enume- 
ration ; in science it carries us but a little way. We 
are forced to begin with it ; we must often rely upon

it provisionally, in the absence of means of more 
searching investigation. But, for the accurate study 
of nature, we require a surer and a more potent 
instrument. 

It was, above all, by pointing out the insufficiency 
of this rude and loose conception of Induction, that 
Bacon merited the title so generally awarded to him, 
of Founder of the Inductive Philosophy. The value 
of his own contributions to a more philosophical 
theory of the subject has certainly been exaggerated. 
Although (along with some fundamental errors) his 
writings contain, more or less fully developed, several 
of the most important principles of the Inductive 
Method, physical investigation has now far outgrown 
the Baconian conception of Inductioiu Moral and 
political inquiry, indeed, are as yet far bdiind that 
conception. The current and approved modes of 
reasoning on these subjects are still of the same 
vicious description against which Bacon protested: 
the method almost exclusively employed by those 
professing to treat such matters inductively, is the 
very inductio per enumerationem simjdicem whidi he 
condemns; and the experience, which we hear so 
confidently appealed to by all sects, parties^ and 
interests, is still, in his own emphatic words, mera 
palpatio. 

$ 3. In order to a better understanding of the 
problem which the logician must solve if he would 
establish a scientific theory of Induction, let U3 com- 
pare a few cases of incorrect inductions with others 
which are acknowledged to be legitimate. Some, we 
know, which were believed for centuries to be correct, 
were nevertheless incorrect. That all swans are 
white, cannot have been a good induction, since the

GROUND OF IWIUCTION. 379 

conclusion has turned out erroneous. The expe- 
rience, however, on which the conclusion rested was 
genuine. From the earUest records, the testimony of 
all the inhabitants of the known world was unanimous 
on the point. The uniform experience, therefore, of 
the inhabitants of the known world, agreeing in a 
common result, without one known instance of devia- 
tion from that result, is not always sufficient to establish 
a general conclusion. 

But let us now turn to an instance apparently not 
very dissimilar to this. Mankind were wrong, it 
seems, in concluding that all swans were white : are 
we also wrong, when we conclude that all men*s heads 
grow above their shoulders, and never below, in spite 
of the conflicting testimony of the naturalist Pliny ? 
As there were black swans, although civilized men 
had existed for three thousand years on the earth 
without meeting with them, may there not also be 
*' men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders," 
notwithstanding a rather less perfect unanimity of 
negative testimony from all observers? Most per- 
sons would answer No ; it was more credible that a 
bird should vary in its colour, than that man should 
vary in the relative position of his principal organs. 
And there is no doubt that in so saying they would be 
right : but to say why they are right, would be impos- 
sible, without entering, more deeply than is usually 
done, into the true theory of Induction. 

Again, there are cases in which we reckon with 
the most unfailing confidence upon uniformity, and 
other cases in which we do not coimt upon it at all. In 
some, we feel complete assurance that the future will 
resemble the past, the unknown be precisely similar to 
the known. In others, however invariable may be 
the result obtained from the instances which we have

380 INDUCTION. 

observed, we draw from them no more than a very 
feeble presumption that the like result will hold in 
all other cases. That a straight line is the shortest 
distance between two points, we do not doubt to be 
true even in the region of the fixed stars. When a 
chemist announces the existence and properties of a 
newly-discovered substance, if we confide in his accu- 
racy, we feel assured that the conclusions he has 
arrived at will hold universally, although the induc- 
tion be founded but on a single instance. We do not 
withhold our assent, waiting for a repetition of the 
experiment ; or if we do, it is from a doubt whether 
the one experiment was properly made, not whether 
if properly made it would be conclusive. Here, then, 
is a general law of nature, inferred without hesitation 
from a single instance ; an universal proposition from 
a singular one. Now mark another case, and contrast 
it with this. Not all the instances which have been 
observed since the beginning of the world, in support 
of the general proposition that all crows are black, 
would be deemed a sufficient presumption of the truth 
of the proposition, to outweigh the testimony of one 
unexceptionable witness who should affirm that in 
some region of the earth not fully explored, he had 
caught and examined a crow, and had found it to be 
grey. 

Why is a single instance, in some cases, sufficient 
for a complete induction, while in others, myriads 
of concurring instances, without a single exception 
known or presumed, go such a very little way towards 
establishing an universal proposition ? Whoever can 

f answer this question knows more of the philosophy 
of logic than the wisest of the ancients, and has 

i solved the great problem of induction.

Chapter IV. 
OF LAWS OF NATURE. 

^ 1. In the contemplation of that uniformity in 
the course of nature, which is assumed in every 
inference from experience, one of the first observa- 
tions that present themselves is, that the uniformity 
in question is not properly uniformity, but u_ni- 
formiti es. The general regularity results from the 
coexistence of partial regularities. The course of 
nature in general is constant, because the course of 
each of the various phenomena that compose it is 
so. A certain fact invariably occurs whenever cer- 
tain circumstances are present, and does not occur 
when they are absent; the like is true of another 
fact; and so on. From these separate threads of 
connexion between parts of the great whole which we 
term nature, a general tissue of connexion unavoidably 
weaves itself, by which the whole is held together. 
If A is always accompanied by D, B by E, and C by 
F, it follows that A B is accompanied by D E, AC 
byDF, BCbyEF, and finally, ABC byDEF; 
and thus the general character of regularity is pro- 
duced, which, along with and in the midst of infinite 
diversity, pervades all nature. 

The first point, therefore, to be noted in regard to 
what is called the uniformity of the course of nature, 
is, that it is itself a complex fact, compounded of all 
the separate uniformities which exist in respect to 
single phenomena. These various uniformities, when 
ascertained by what is regarded as a sufficient induc- 
tion, we call in common parlance, Laws of Nature.

382 INDUCTION. 

Scientifically speaking, that title is employed in a 
more restricted sense, to designate the uniformities 
when reduced to their most simple expression. Thus 
in the illustration already employed, there were seven 
uniformities ; all of which, if considered suflSciently 
certain, would, in the more lax application of the 
term, be called laws of nature. But of the seven, 
three alone are properly distinct and independent; 
these being pre-supposed, the others follow of course : 
the three first, therefore, according to the stricter 
accq)tation, are called laws of nature, the remainder 
not; because they are in truth mere cases of the 
three first; virtually included in them; said, there- 
fore, to result from them: whoever affirms those 
three has already affirmed all the rest. 

To substitute real examples for symbolical ones, 
the following are three uniformities, or call them 
laws of nature : the law that air has weight, the law 
that pressure on a fluid is propagated equally in all 
directions, and the law that pressure in one direction, 
not opposed by an equal pressure in the contrary 
direction, produces motion, which does not cease 
until equilibrium is restored. From these three uni- 
formities we should be able to predict another imi- 
formity, namely, the rise of the mercury in the 
Torricellian tube. This, in the stricter use of the 
phrase, is not a law of nature. It is a result of laws 
of nature. It is a case of each and every one of the 
three laws ; and is the only occurrence by which they 
could all be fulfilled. If the mercury were not sus- 
tained in the barometer, and sustained at such a hdght 
that the column of mercury were equal in weight to a 
column of the atmosphere, of the same diameter; 
here would be a case, either of the air not pressing 
upon the surface of the mercury with the £cxtce which

LAW9 OF NATURE. 383 

i8 called its weight, or of the downward pressure on 
the mercury not being propagated equally in an 
upward direction, or of a body pressed in one direc- 
tion and not in the direction opposite, either not 
moving in the direction in which it is pressed, or 
stopping before it had attained equilibrium. If we 
knew, therefore, the three simple laws, but had never 
tried the Torricellian experiment, we might deduce its 
result from those laws. The known weight of the air, 
combined with the position of the apparatus, would 
bring the mercury within the first of the three in- 
ductions; the first induction would bring it within 
the second, and the second within the third, in the 
manner which we so fully illustrated in treating of 
Ratiocination. We should thus come to know the 
more complex uniformity, independently of specific 
experience, throu^ our knowledge of the simpler 
ones from which it results; although, for reasons 
which will appear hereafter, verification by specific 
experience would still be desirable, and might possibly 
be indispensable. 

Complex uniformities which, like this, are mere 
cases of simpler ones, and have, therefore, been vir- 
tually inferred in affirming those, may with propriety 
be called ImoSy but can scarcely, in the strictness of 
scientific speech, be termed Laws of Nature. It is the 
custom of philosophers, wherever they can trace 
regularity of any kind, to call the general proposition 
which represses the nature of that regularity, a law; 
as when, in n^hematics, we speak of the law of 
decrease of the successive terms of a converging series. 
But the expression, law af nature, is generally em- 
ployed by scientific men with a sort of tacit reference 
to the original seose of the word law, namely, the 
«q>ression of the will of a superior ; the superior, in

384 INDUCTION. 

this instance, being the Ruler of the universe. When, 
therefore, it appeared that any of the uniformities 
which were observed in nature, would result sponta- 
neously from certain other uniformities, without any 
separate act of creative will, the former have not 
usually been spoken of as laws of nature. According 
to another mode of expression, the question, What 
are the laws of nature ? may be stated thus : — ^What 
are the fewest and simplest assumptions, which being 
granted, the whole existing order of nature would 
result ? Another mode of stating it would be thus : 
What are the fewest general propositions from which 
all the uniformities which exist in the universe might 
be deductively inferred ? 

As has already been hinted (and will be more 
fully discussed hereafter) every great advance which 
marks an epoch in the progress of science, has con- 
sisted in a step made towards the solution of this 
problem. Even a simple colligation of inductions 
already made, without any fresh extension of the 
inductive inference, is already an advance in that 
direction. When Kepler expressed the regularity 
which exists in the observed motions of the heavenly 
bodies, by the three general propositions caUed his 
laws, he, in so doing, pointed out three simple voli- 
tions, by which, instead of a much greater number, 
it appeared that the whole scheme of the heavenly 
motions^ so far as yet observed, might be con- 
ceived to have been produced. A similar, and still* 
greater step was made when these laws, which 
at first did not seem to be included in any more 
general truths, were discovered to be cases of the 
three laws of motion, as obtaining among bodies 
which mutually tend towards one another with a 
certain force, and have had a certain instantaneous

LAWS OF NATURE. 385 

impulse originally impressed upon them. After this 
great discovery, Kepler's three propositions, though 
still called laws, would hardly, by any person accus- 
tomed to use language with precision, be termed laws 
of nature : that phrase would be reserved for the 
simpler laws into which Newton, as the expression 
is, resolved them. 

According to this language, every well-grounded 
inductive generalization is either a law of nature, or a 
result of laws of nature, capable, if those laws are 
known, of being predicted from them. And the 
problem of Inductive Logic may be summed up in 
two questions : How to ascertain the laws of nature? 
and How, after having ascertained them, to follow 
them into their results ? On the other hand, we must 
not suffer ourselves to imagine that this' mode of 
statement amounts to a real analysis, or to anything 
but a mere verbal transformation of the problem; 
for the expression. Laws of Nature, meam nothing 
but the uniformities which exist among natural phe- 
nomena (or, in other words, the results of induction-,) 
when reduced to their simplest expression. It is, 
however, something, to have advanced so far, as to 
see that the study of nature is the study of laws, not 
a law ; of uniformities, in the plural number : that 
the different natural phenomena have their separate 
rules or modes of taking place, which, though much 
intermixed and entangled with one another, may, to a 
certain extent, be studied apart : that (to resume our 
former metaphor) the regularity which exists in 
nature is a web composed of distinct threads, and only 
to be understood by tracing each of the threads sepa- 
rately; for which purpose it is often necessary to 
unravel some portion of the web, and exhibit the fibres

386 INDUCTION. 

apart. Tlie rulf;8 of experimental inquiry are the 
contrivances for unravelling the web. 

$ 2. In thus attempting to ascertain the general 
order of nature by ascertaining the particular order 
of the occurrence of each one of the phenomena of 
nature, the most scientific proceeding can be no more 
than an improved form of that which was primitively 
pursued by the human understanding, as yet undirected 
by science. When men first formed the idea of 
studying phenomena according to a stricter and surer 
method than that which they had in the first instance 
spontaneously adopted, they did not, conformably to 
the well meant but impracticable precept of Descartes, 
set out from the supposition that nothing had been 
already ascertained. Many of the uniformities exist- 
ing among phenomena are so constant, and so open 
to observation, as to force themselves upon men's 
involimtary recognition. Some facts are so perpe- 
tually and familiarly accompanied by certain others, 
that mankind learnt, as children now learn, to expect 
the one where they found the other, long before they 
knew how to put their expectation into words by 
asserting, in a proposition, the existence of a con- 
nexion between those phenomena. No science was 
needed to teach men that food nourishes, that water 
drowns, or quenches thirst, that the sun gives light 
and heat, that bodies fall to the groimd. The first 
scientific inquirers assumed these and the like as 
known truths, and set out from them to discover 
others which were unknown : nor were they wrong in 
so doing, subject, however, as they afterwards began 
to see, to an ulterior revision of these spontaneous 
generalizations themselves, when the progress of

LAWS OF NATURE. 387 

knowledge pointed out limits to them, or shewed 
their truth to be contingent upon some other circum- 
stance not originally attended to. It will appear, I 
thmk^ from the subsequent part of our inquiry, that 
there is no logical fallacy in this mode of proceed- 
ing ; but we may see already that any other mode 
is rigorously impracticable: since it is impossible to 
frame any scientific method of induction, or test of the 
correctness of inductions, unless upon the hypothesis 
that some inductions of unquestionable certainty have 
been already made. 

Let us revert, for instance, to one of our former 
illustrations, and consider why it is that, with exactly 
the same amount of evidence, both negative and 
positive, we did not reject the assertion that there are 
black swans, while we should refuse credence to any 
testimony which asserted that there were men wearing 
their heads underneath their shoulders. The first 
assertion was more credible than the latter* But 
why more credible ? So long as neither phenomenon 
had been actually witnessed, what reason was there 
for finding the one harder to believe^han the other ? 
Apparently, because there is less constancy in the 
colours of animals, than in the general structure of 
their internal anatomy. But how do we know this ? 
Doubtless, from experience. It appears, then, that we 
need experience to inform us, in what cases, or in 
what sorts of cases, experience is to be relied upoo. 
Experience must be consulted in order to learn from 
it \mder what circumstances arguments from it will 
be valid. We have no ulterior test to which we 
subject experience in general; but we make expe- 
rience its own test. Experience testifies, that among 
the uniformities which it exhibits or seems to exhibit, 
some are more to be relied upon than others; and 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



388 INDUCTION. 

uniformity, therefore, may be presumed, from any 
given number of instances, with a greater degree of 
assurance, in proportion as the case belongs to a class 
in which the uniformities have hitherto been found 
more uniform. 

This mode of correcting one generalization by 
means of another, a narrower generalization by a 
wider, which common sense suggests and adopts in 
practice, is the real type of scientific Induction. All 
that art can do is but to give accuracy and precision 
to this process, and adapt it to all varieties of cases, 
without any essential alteration in its principle. 

There are of course no means of applying such a 
test as that above described, unless we already possess 
a general knowledge of the prevalent character of the 
uniformities existing throughout nature. The indis- 
pensable foundation, therefore, of a scientific formula of 
induction, must be a survey of the inductions to which 
mankind have been conducted in unscientific practice; 
with the special purpose of ascertaining what kinds 
of uniformities have been found perfectly invariable, 
pervading all natm^, and what are those which have 
been found to vary with difference of time, place, or 
other changeable circumstances. 

§ 3. The necessity of such a survey is confirmed 
by the consideration, that the stronger inductions are 
the touchstone to which we always endeavour to bring 
the weaker. If we find any means of deducing one 
of the less strong inductions from stronger ones, 
it acquires, at once, all the strength of those from 
which it is deduced ; and even adds to that strength ; 
since the independent experience on which the 
weaker induction previously rested, becomes addi- 
tional evidence of the truth of the better esta-

LAWS OF NATURE. 389 

blished law in which it is now found to be included. 
We may have inferred, from historical evidence, that 
the uncontrolled government of a monarchy, of an 
aristocracy, or of the majority, will commonly be a 
tyranny : but we are entitled to rely upon this gene- 
ralization with much greater assurance when it is 
shown to be a corollary from still better established 
truths; the infirmity of human nature, and the impos- 
sibity of maintaining the predominance of reason and 
conscience over the selfish propensities by any means 
except such as the supposition of absolute power neces- 
sarily excludes. It is at the same time obvious that 
even these great facts in human nature derive an acces- 
sion of evidence fix)m the testimony which history 
bears to the eflfects of despotism. The strong induc- 
tion becomes still stronger when a weaker one has 
been bound up with it. 

On the other hand, if an induction conflicts with 
stronger inductions^ or with conclusions capable of 
being correctly deduced from them, then, unless upon 
re-consideration it should appear that some of the 
stronger inductions have been stretched too far, the 
weaker one must give way. The opinion so long pre- 
valent that a comet, or any other unusual appearance 
in the heavenly regions, was the precursor of cala- 
mities to mankind, or to those at least who witnessed 
it ; the belief in the veracity of the oracles of Delphi 
or Dodona; the reliance on astrology, or on the 
weather-prophecies in almanacs ; were doubtless induc- 
tions supposed to be groimded on experience: and 
faith in such delusions seems quite capable of holding 
out against a great multitude of feilures, provided it 
be nourished by a reasonable number of casual coinci- 
dences between the prediction and the event. What 
has really put an end to these insufficient inductions.

390 INDUCTION. 

is their inconsistency with the stronger inductionii 
subsequently obtained by scientific inquiry, respecting 
the causes upon which terrestrial events really depend; 
and where those scientific truths have not yet pene- 
trated, the same or similar delusions still prevail. 

It may be affirmed as a general principle, that all 
inductions, whether strong or weak, which can be 
connected together by a ratiocination, are confirma- 
tory of one another: while any which lead deductively 
to consequences that are incompatible, become mutu- 
ally each other's test, showing that one or other must 
be given up, or, at least, more guardedly expressed. 
In the case of inductions which confirm each other, 
the one which becomes a conclusion from ratiocina- 
tion rises to at least the level of certainty of the 
weakest of those from which it is deduced; while 
in general all are more or less increased in cer- 
tainty. Thus the Torricellian experiment, though a 
mere case of three more general laws, not only 
strengthened greatly the evidence on which those 
laws rested, but converted one of them (the weight of 
the atmosphere) from a doubtful generalization into 
one of the best-established doctrines in the range of 
physical science. 

If, then, a survey of the uniformities which have 
been ascertained to exist in nature, should point out 
some which, as far as any human purpose requires 
certainty, may be considered as absolutely certain 
and absolutely universal ; then by means of these 
uniformities, we may be able to raise multitudes of 
other inductions to the same point in the scale. For 
if we can show, with respect to any induction, that 
either it must be true, or one of these certain and 
universal inductions must admit of an exception; the 
former generalization will attain the same absolute

certainty, and indefeasibleness within the bounds 
assigned to it, which are the attributes of the latter. 
It will be proved to be a law ; and if not a result of 
other and simpler laws, it will be a law of nature. 

There are such certain and universal inductions ; 
and it is because there are such, that a Logic of 
Induction is possible.

Chapter V. 
OF THE LAW OF UNIVERSAL CAUSATION. 

§ 1. Thb phenomena of nature exist in two 
di&tinct relations to one another ; that of simultaneity, 
and that of succession. Every phenomenon is related, 
in an uniform manner, to some phenomena that 
coexist with it, and to some that have preceded or wiU 
follow it. 

Of the uniformities which exist among synchronous 
phenomena, the most important, on every account, 
are the laws of number ; and next to them those of 
space, or in other words, of extension and figure. 
The laws of number are common to synchronous and 
successive phenomena. That two and two make 
four, is equally true whether the second two follow 
the first two or accompany them. It is as true of 
days and years as of feet and inches. The laws of 
extension and figure, (in other words, the theorems of 
geometry, from its lowest to its highest branches,) are, 
on the contrary, laws of simultaneous phenomena only. 
The various parts of space, and of the objects which 
are said to fill space, coexist ; and the unvarying laws 
which are the subject of the science of geometry, are 
an expression of the mode of their coexistence. 

This is a class of laws, or in other words, of unifor- 
mities, for the comprehension and proof of which it is 
not necessary to suppose any lapse of time, any variety 
of facts or events succeeding one another. If all the 
objects in the universe were unchangeably fixed, and 
had remained in that condition from eternity, the 
propositions of geometry would still be true of those 



Digitized 



by Google 



LAW OF CAUSATION. 393 

objects. All things which possess extension, or in 
other words, which fill space, are subject to geome- 
trical laws. Possessing extension, they possess figure; 
possesshxg figure, they must possess some figure in 
particular, and have all the properties which geometry 
assigns to that figure. If one body be a sphere and 
the other a cylinder, of equal height and diameter, 
the one will be exactly two-thirds of the other, let 
the nature and quality of the material be what it will. 
Again, each body, and each point of a body, must 
occupy some place or position among other bodies ; 
and the position of two bodies relatively to each 
other, of whatever nature the bodies be, may be 
unerringly inferred from the position of each of them 
relatively to any third body. 

In the laws of number, then, and in those of space, 
we recognise, in the most unqualified manner, the 
rigorous universality of which we are in quest. Those 
laws have been in all ages the type of certainty, the 
standard of comparison for all inferior degrees of 
evidence. Their invariability is so perfect, that we 
are unable even to conceive any exception to them ; 
and philosophers have been led, although (as I have 
endeavoured to show) erroneously, to consider their 
evidence as lying not in experience, but in the original 
constitution of the human intellect. If, therefore, 
from the laws of space and number, we were able to 
deduce uniformities of any other description, this 
would be conclusive evidence to us that those other 
uniformities possessed the same degree of rigorous 
certainty. But this we cannot do. From laws of 
space and number alone, nothing can be deduced but 
laws of space and number. 

Of all truths relating to phenomena, the most 
valuable to us are those which relate to the order of 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



394 INDUCTION. 

their succession. On a knowledge of these is founded 
every reasonable anticipation of future facts, and what- 
ever power we possess of influencing those facts to 
our advantage. Even the laws of geometry are chiefly 
of practical importance to us as being a portion of the 
premisses from which the order of the succession of 
phenomena may be inferred. 

Inasmuch as the motion of bodies, the action of 
forces, and the propagation of influences of aU sorts, 
take place in certain lines and over definite spaces, the 
properties of those lines and spaces are an important 
part of the laws to which those phenomena are them- 
selves subject. Moreover, motions, forces or other 
influences, and times, are numerable quantities ; and the 
properties of number are applicable to them as to all 
other things. But although the laws of number and 
space are important elements in the ascertainment of 
uniformities of succession, they can do nothing towards 
it when taken by themselves. They can only be made 
instrumental to that purpose when we combine with 
them additional premisses, expressive of uniformities 
of succession already known. By taking, for instance, 
as premisses these propositions, that bodies acted 
upon by an instantaneous force move with uniform 
velocity in straight lines ; that bodies acted upon by 
a continuous force move with accelerated velocity in 
straight lines; and that bodies acted upon by two 
forces in difierent directions move in the diagonal of 
a parallelogram, whose sides represent the direction 
and quantity of those forces ; we may by combining 
these truths with propositions relating to the pro- 
perties of straight lines and of parallelograms, (as 
that a triangle is half of a parallelogram of the same 
base and altitude,) deduce another important uniformity 
of succession, viz., that a body moving round a centre 



Digitized 



by Google 



LAW OF CAUSATION. 395 

of force describes areas proportional to the times. 
But unless there had been laws of succession in our 
premisses 9 there could have been no truths of succes- 
sion in our conclusions. A similar remark might be 
extended to every other class of phenomena really 
peculiar; and, had it been attended to, would have 
prevented many chimerical attempts at demonstrations 
of the indemonstrable, and explanations of what can- 
not be explained. 

It is not, therefore, enough for us that the laws 
of space, which are only laws of simultaneous phe- 
nomena, and the laws of number, which though true 
of successive phenomena do not relate to their suc- 
cession, possess that rigorous certainty and univer- 
sality of which we are in search. We must endeavour 
to jSnd some law of succession which has those same 
attributes, and is therefore fit to be made the founda- 
tion of processes for discovering, and of a test for 
verifying, all othelr uniformities of succession. This 
fundamental law must resemble the truths of geometry 
in their most remarkable peculiarity, that of never 
^ being, in any instance whatever, defeated or suspended 
by any change of circumstances. 

Now among all those uniformities in the suc- 
cession of phenomena, which common observation 
is sufficient to bring to light, there are very few which 
have any, even apparent, pretension to this rigorous 
indefeasibility : and of those few, one only has been 
found capable of completely sustaining it. In that 
one, however, we recognise a law which is universal 
also in another sense ; it is coextensive with the entire 
field of successive phenomena, aU instances whatever 
of succession being examples of it. This law is the 
Law of Causation. It is an universal truth that every 
fact which has a beginning has a cause.

This generalization may appear to some minds 
not to amount to much, since after all it asserts only 
this : " it is a law, that every event depends upon 
some law." We must not, however, conclude that 
the generality of the principle is merely verbal; it 
will be found upon inspection to be no vague or 
unmeaning assertion, but a most important and really 
fundamental truth. 

§ 2. The notion of Cause being the root of the 
whole theory of Induction, it is indispensable that this 
idea should, at the very outset of our inquiry, be, with 
the utmost practicable degree of precision, fixed and 
determined,^ If, indeed, it were necessary for the 
purposes of inductive logic that the strife should be 
quelled, which has so long raged among the difierent 
schools of metaphysicians, respecting the origin and 
analysis of our idea of causation ; the promulgation, 
or at least the general reception, of a true theory of 
induction, might be considered desperate, for a long 
time to come. But in this as in most other respects, 
the science of the Investigation of Truth by means 
of Evidence, has no need to borrow any premisses 
from the science of the ultimate constitution of the 
human mind, except such as have at last, though 
often after long controversy, been incorporated into 
all the existing systems of mental philosophy, or all 
but such as may be regarded as essentially effete. 

I premise, then, that when in the course of this 
inquiry I speak of the cause of any phenomenon, I 
do not mean a cause which is not itself a pheno- 
menon; I make no research into the ultimate, or 
ontological cause of anything. To adopt a distinction 
familiar in the writings of the Scotch metaphysicians 
and especially of Reid, the causes with which I

concern myself are not efficient, but physical causes. ^ 
They are causes in that sense alone^ in which one 
physical fact may be said to be the cause of another. 
Of the efficient causes of phenomena, or whether any 
such causes exist at all, I am not called upon to give 
an opinion. The notion of c&usation is deemed, by 
the schools of metaphysics most in vogue at the 
present moment, to imply a mysterious and most 
powerful tie, such as cannot, or at least does not, 
exist between any physical fact and that other phy- 
sical fact upon which it is invariably consequent, and 
which is popularly termed its cause : and thence is 
deduced the supposed necessity of ascending higher, 
into the essences and inherent constitution of things, to 
find the true cause, the cause which is not only followed 
by, but actuaUy produces^ the effect. No such necessity 
exists for the purposes of the present inquiry, nor 
will any such doctrine be found in the following pages. 
But neither will there be found anything incompatible 
with it. We are in no way concerned in the question. 
The only notion of a cause, which the theory of induc- 
tion requires, is such a notion as can be gained from 
experience. The Law of Causation, the recognition 
of which is the main pillar of inductive philosophy, / 
is but the familiar truth, that invariability of succes- ' 
sion is found by observation to obtain between every 
fact in nature and some other fact which has pre- ' 
ceded it ; independently of all consideration respecting .' 
the ultimate mode of production of phenomena, and 
of every other question regarding the nature of 
" Thmgs in themselves.'^ 

Between the phenomena, then, which exist at any 
instant, and the phenomena which exist at the suc- 
ceeding instant, there is an invariable order of succes- 
sion; and, as we said in speaking of the general 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



398 INDUCTION. 

uniformity of the course of nature, this web is com- 
posed of separate fibres ; this collective order is made 
up of particular sequences, obtaining invariably among 
the separate parts. To certain facts, certain facts 
always do, and, as we believe, always will, succeed. 
The invariable antecedent is termed the cause; the 
invariable consequent, the effect. And the universality 
of the law of causation consists in this, that every 
consequent is connected in this manner with some 
particular antecedent, or set of antecedents. Let the 
fact be what it may, if it has begun to exist, it was 
preceded by some fact or facts, with which it is inva- 
riably connected. For every event, there exists some 
combination of objects or events, some given concur- 
rence of circumstances, positive and negative, the 
occurrence of which will always be followed by that 
phenomenon. We may not have found out what 
this concurrence of circumstances may be ; but we 
never doubt that there is such a one, and that it never 
occurs without having the phenomenon in question as 
its effect or consequence. Upon the universality of 
this truth depends the possibility of reducing the 
inductive process to rules. The undoubted assurance 
we have that there is a law to be found if we only 
knew how to find it, will be seen presently to be the 
source from which the canons of the Inductive Logic 
derive their vaUdity, 

$3. It is seldom, if ever, between a consequent 
and one single antecedent, that this invariable se- 
quence subsists. It is usually between a consequent 
and the sum of several antecedents ; the concurrence 
of them all being requisite to produce, that is, to be 
certain of being followed by, the consequent. In such 
cases it is very common to single out one only of the

LAW OF CAUSATION. 399 

antecedents under the denomination of CaQse, calling 
the others merely Conditions. Thus if a man eats of a 
particular dish, and dies in consequence, that is, 
would not have died if he had not eaten of it, people 
would be apt to say that eating of that dish was the 
cause of his death. There needs not, however, be 
any invariable connexion between eating of the dish 
and death ; but there certainly is, among the circum- 
stances which took place, some combination or other 
upon which death is invariably consequent: as, for 
instance, the act of eating of the dish, combined with 
a particular bodily constitution, a particular state of 
present health, and perhaps even a certain state of the 
atmosphere ; the whole of which circumstances per- 
haps constituted in this particular case the conditions 
of the phenomenon, or in other words the set of 
antecedents which determined it, and but for which it 
would not have happened. The real Cause, is the \ 
whole of these antecedents ; and we have, philoso- / 
phically speaking, no right to give the name of cause ) 
to one of them, exclusively of the others. What, in 
the case we have supposed, disguises the incorrectness 
of the expression, is this : that the various conditions, 
except the single one of eating the food, were not 
events (that is, instantaneous changes, or successions 
of instantaneous changes) but states^ possessing more 
or less of permanency; and might therefore have 
preceded the effect by an indefinite length of duration, 
for want of the event which was requisite to complete 
the required concurrence of conditions : while as soon 
as that event, eating the food, occurs, no other cause 
is waited for, but the effect begins immediately to 
take place : and hence the appearance is presented of 
a more immediate and closer connexion between the 
effect and that one antecedent, than between the effect

400 INDUCTION. 

and the remaining conditions. But although we may 
think proper to give the name of cause to that one 
condition^ the fulfilment of which completes the tale, 
and brings about the effect without further delay ; this 
condition has really no closer relation to the effect 
than any of the other conditions has. The production 
of the consequent required that they should all exist 
immediately previous, though not that they should all 
begin to exist immediately previous. The statement 
of the cause is incomplete, unless in some shape or 
other we introduce all the conditions. A man takes 
mercury, goes out of doors, and catches cold. We 
say, perhaps, that the cause of his taking cold was 
exposure to the air. It is clear, however, that his 
having taken mercury may have been a necessary 
condition of his catching cold ; and though it might 
consist with usage to say that the cause of his attack 
was exposure to the air, to be accurate we ought to 
say that the cause was exposure to the air while under 
the effect of mercury. 

If we do not, when aiming at accuracy, enumerate 
all the conditions, it is only because some of them 
will in most cases be understood without being 
expressed, or because for the purpose in view they 
may without detriment be overlooked. For exam- 
ple, when we say, the cause of a man's death was 
that his foot slipped in climbing a ladder, we omit 
as a thing unnecessary to be stated the circum- 
stance of his weight, though quite as indispensable 
a condition of the effect which took place. When 
we say that the assent of the crown to a bUl 
makes it law, we mean that the assent, being never 
given until all the other conditions are fulfilled, makes 
up the sum of the conditions, although no one now 
regards it as the principal one. When the decision

of a legislative assembly has been determined by the 
casting vote of ihe chairman, we often say that this one 
person was the cause of all the effects which resulted 
from the enactment. Yet we do not really suppose 
that his single vote contributed more to the result 
than that of any other person who voted in the 
affirmative ; but, for the purpose we have in view, 
which is that of fixing him with the responsibility, the 
share which any other person took in the transaction 
is not material. 

In all these instances the fact which was dignified by 
the name of cause, was the one condition which came 
last into existence. But it must not be supposed 
that in the employment of the term this or any other 
rule is always adhered to. Nothing can better sho^ 
the absence of any scientific ground for the distinction 
between the cause of a phenomenon and its conditions, 
than the capricious manner in which we select from 
among the conditions that which we choose to deno- 
minate the cause. However numerous the conditions 
may be, there is hardly any of them which may not, 
according to the purpose of our immediate discourse, 
obtain that nominal pre-eminence. This will be seen 
by analyzing the conditions of some one familiar 
phenomenon. For example, a stone thrown into 
water falls to the bottom. What are the conditions of 
this event ? In the first place there must be a stone, 
and water, and the stone must be thrown into the 
water ; but, these suppositions forming part of the 
enunciation of the phenomenon itself, to include them 
also among the conditions would be a vicious tauto- 
logy, and this class of conditions, therefore, have 
never received the name of cause from any but the 
schoolmen, by whom they were called the material 
cause, causa materialise The next condition is, there

must be an earth : and accordingly it is often said, 
that the fall of a stone is caused by the earth ; or by 
a power or property of the earth, or a force exerted 
by the earth, all of which are merely roundabout ways 
of saying that it is caused by the earth ; or, lastly, 
the earth's attraction ; which also is only a technical 
mode of saying that the earth causes the motion, with 
the additional particularity that the motion is towards 
the earth, which is not a character of the cause, but 
of the effect. Let us now pass to another condition. 
It is not enough that the earth should exist ; the 
body must be within that distance from it, in which 
the earth's attraction preponderates over that of any 
other body. Accordingly we may say, and the ex- 
pression would be confessedly correct, that the cause 
of the stone's falling is its being within the sphere of 
the earth's attraction. We proceed to a further con- 
dition. The stone is immersed in water : it is there- 
fore a condition of its reaching the ground, that its 
specific gravity exceed that of the surrounding fluid, 
or in other words that it surpass in weight an equal 
volume of water. Accordingly, any one would be 
acknowledged to speak correctly who said, that the 
cause of the stone's going to the bottom is its exceed- 
ing in specific gravity the fluid in which it is immersed. 
Thus we see that each and every condition of 
the phenomenon may be taken in its turn, and, 
with equal propriety in common parlance but with 
equal impropriety in scientific discourse, may be 
spoken of as if it were the entire cause. And in 
practice that particular condition is usually styled 
the cause, whose share in the matter is superficially 
the most conspicuous, or whose requisiteness to 
the production of the effect we happen to be insist- 
ing upon at the moment. So great is the force <rf

this last consideration, that it often induces us to 
give the name of cause even to one of the negative 
conditions. We say, for example, The cause of the 
army's being surprised was the sentinel's being off his 
post. But since the sentinel's absence was not what 
created the enemy, or made the soldiers to be asleep, 
how did it cause them to be surprised ? All that is 
really meant is, that the event would not have happened 
if he had been at his duty. His being off his post was no 
producing cause, but the mere absence of a preventing 
cause : it was simply equivalent to his non-existence. 
From nothing, from a mere negation, no conse- 
quences can proceed. All effects are connected, by the 
law of causation, with some set of positive conditions; 
negative ones, it is true, being almost always required 
in addition. In other words, every fact or pheno- 
menon which has a beginning, invariably arises when 
some certain combination of ppsit^ve facts exists, pro- 
vided certain other positive facts do not exist. 

Since, then, mankind are accustomed, with ac- 
knowledged propriety so far as the ordinances of 
language are concerned, to give the name of cause 
to almost any one of the conditions of a phenomenon, 
or any portion of the whole number, arbitrarily 
selected, without excepting even those conditions 
which are purely negative, and in themselves inca- 
pable of causing anything; it will probably be ad- 
mitted without longer discussion, that no one of the 
conditions has more claim to that title than another, 
and that the real cause of the phenomenon is the 
assemblage of all its conditions. There is, no doubt, 
a tendency (which our first example, that of death 
from taking a particular food, suflSciently illustrates) 
to associate the idea of causation with the proxi- 
mate antecedent event, rather than with any of the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



404 INDUCTION. 

antecedent states^ or permanent facts, which may 
happen also to be conditions of the phenomenon ; the 
reason being that the event not only exists, but begins 
to exist immediately previous ; while the other con- 
ditions may have preexisted for an indefinite time. 
And this tendency shows itself very visibly in the dif- 
ferent logical fictions which are resorted to even by 
philosophers, to avoid the necessity of giving the name 
of cause to anything which had existed for an indeter- 
minate length of time before the effect. Thus, rather 
than say that the earth causes the fall of bodies, 
they ascribe it to a force exerted by the earth, or an 
attraction by the earth, abstractions which they can 
represent to themselves as exhausted by each effort, 
and therefore constituting at each successive instant a 
fresh fact, simultaneous with, or only immediately pre- 
ceding, the effect. Inasmuch as the coming of the 
circumstance which completes the assemblage of con- 
ditions, is a change or event, it thence happens that 
an event is always the antecedent in closest apparent 
proximity to the consequent : and this may accoimt for 
the illusion which disposes us to look upon the proxi- 
mate event as standing more pecuUarly in the position 
of a cause than any of the antecedent states. But even 
this peculiarity, of being in closer proximity to the eflfect 
than any other of its conditions, is, as we have already 
seen, far firom being necessary to the common notion 
of a cause ; with which notion, on the contrary, any 
one of the conditions, either positive or negative, is 
found, upon occasion, completely to accord. 

The cause, then, philosophically speaking, is the 
sum total of the conditions, positive and negative, 
taken together; the whole of the contingencies of 
every description, which being realized, the conse- 
quent invariably follows. The negative conditions.

however, of any phenomenon, a special enumeration 
of which would generally be very prolix, may be all 
summed up under one head, namely, the absence of pre- 
venting or counteracting causes. The convenience of 
this mode of expression is grounded mainly upon the 
fact, that the effects of any cause in counteracting ano- 
ther cause may in most cases be, with strict scientific 
exactness, regarded as a mere extension of its own 
proper and separate effects. If gravity retards the 
upward motion of a projectile, and deflects it into a 
paraboUc trajectory, it produces, in so doing, the very 
same kind of effect, and even (as mathematicians 
know) the same quantity of effect, as it does in its 
ordinary operation of causing the fall of bodies when 
simply deprived of their support. If an alkaline 
solution mixed with an acid destroys its sourness, 
and prevents it from reddening vegetable blues, it is 
because the specific effect of the alkali is to combine 
with the acid, and form a compound with totally 
different qualities. This property, which causes of all 
descriptions possess, of preventing the effects of other 
causes by virtue (for the most part) of the same laws, 
according to which they produce their own*, enables 



* There are a few exceptions; for there are some properties of 
objects which seem to be purely preventive; as the property of 
opaque bodies, by which they intercept the passage of light. This, 
80 far as we are able to understand it, appears an instance not of 
one cause counteracting another by the same law whereby it pro- 
duces its own effects, but of an agency which manifests itself in no 
other way than in defeating the effects of another agency. If we 
knew upon what other relations to light, or upon what peculiarities 
of structure, opacity depends, we might find that this is only an 
apparent, not a real, exception to the general proposition in the 
text. In any case it needs not affect the practical application. 
The formula which includes all the negative conditions of an effect 
in the single one of the absence of counteracting causes, is not

US, by establishing the general axiom that all causes 
are liable to be counteracted in their effects by one 
another, to dispense with the consideration of negative 
conditions entirely, and limit the notion of cause to 
the assemblage of the positive conditions of the pheno- 
menon: one negative condition invariably under- 
stood, and the same in all instances (namely, the 
absence of all counteracting causes) being sufficient, 
along with the sum of the positive conditions, to make 
up the whole set of circumstances upon which the 
phenomenon is dependant. 

§ 4. Among the positive conditions, as we have 
seen that there are some to which, in common par- 
lance, the term cause is more readily and frequently 
awarded, so there are others to which it is, in ordinary 
circumstances, refused. In most cases of causation 
a distinction is commonly drawn between something 
which acts, and some other thing which is acted upon, 
between an agent and a patient. Both of these, it 
would be universally allowed, are conditions of the 
phenomenon ; but it would be thought absurd to call 
the latter the cause, that title being reserved for the 
former. The distinction, however, vanishes on exami- 
nation, or rather is found to be only verbal ; arising 
from an incident of mere expression, namely, that the 
object said to be a^^ted upon, and which is considered 
as the scene in which the effect takes place, is com- 
monly included in the phrase by which the effect is 



Tiolated by such cases as this; although, if all counteractiDg 
agencies were of this description, there would be no purpose served 
by emplopng the formula, since wo should still have to enumerate 
specially the negative conditions of each phenomenon, instead of 
regarding them as implicitly contained in the positive laws of the 
various other agencies in nature.

8poken of, so that if it were also reckoned as part of 
the cause, the seeming incongruity would arise of its 
being supposed to cause itself. In the instance which 
we have already had, of falling bodies, the question was 
thus put : — ^What is the cause which makes a stone 
fall? and if the answer had been ** the stone itself,'* 
the expression would have been in apparent contra- 
diction to the meaning of the word cause. The stone, 
therefore, is conceived as the patient, and the earth 
(or, according to the common and most unphiloso- 
phical practice, some occult quality of the earth) is 
represented as the agent, or cause. But that there is 
nothing fundamental in the distinction may be seen 
from this, that if we do but alter the mere wording of 
the question, and express it thus, What is the cause 
which produces vertical motion towards the earth? 
we might now, without any incongruity, speak of the 
stone or other heavy body as the agent, which, by 
virtue of its own laws or properties, commences 
moving towards the earth j although, to save the esta- 
blished doctrine of the inactivity of matter, men 
usually prefer here also to ascribe the effect to an 
occult quality, and say that the cause is not the stone 
itself, but the weight or gravitation of the stone. 

Those who have contended for a radical distinc- 
tion between agent and patient, have generally con- 
ceived the agent as that which causes some state of, 
or some change in the state of, another object which is 
called the patient. But a little reflection will show 
that the license we assume of speaking of phenomena 
as states of the various objects which take part in 
them, (an artifice of which so much use has been 
made by some philosophers. Brown in particular^ for 
the apparent explanation of phenomena,) is simply a 
sort of logical fiction, useful sometimes as one among

408 INDUCTION. 

several modes of expression, but which should never 
be supposed to be the statement of a philosophical 
truth. Even those of the attributes of an object 
which might seem with greatest propriety to be 
called states of the object itself, its sensible equalities, 
its colour, hardness, shape, and the like, are, in reality, 
(as no one has pointed out more clearly than Brown 
himself,) phenomena of causation, in which the sub- 
stance is distinctly the agent, or producing cause, the 
patient being our own organs, and those of other 
sentient beingfe. What we call the states of objects, 
are always sequences into which those objects enter, 
generally as antecedents or causes; and things are 
never more active than in the production of those phe- 
nomena in which they are said to be acted upon. 
Thus, in the last example, that of a sensation pro- 
duced in our organs, are not the laws of our organi- 
zation, and even those of our minds, as directly ope- 
rative in determining the effect produced, as the laws 
of the outward object ? Though we call prussic acid 
the agent of a man's death, are not the whole of the 
vital and organic properties of the patient as actively 
instrumental as the poison, in the chain of effects 
which so rapidly terminates his sentient existence? 
In the process of education, we may call the teacher 
the agent, and the scholar only the material acted 
upon ; yet in truth all the facts which pre-existed 
in the scholar's mind exert either co-operating or 
counteracting agencies in relation to the teacher*s 
efforts. It is not light alone which is the agent in 
vision, but light coupled with the active properties of 
the eye and brain, and with those of the visible object. 
The distinction between agent and patient is merely 
verbal : patients are always agents ; in a great propor- 
tion, indeed, of all natural phenomena, they are so to

such a degree as to react raost forcibly upon the 
causes which acted upon them : and even when this is 
not the case, they contribute, in the same manner as 
any of the other conditions, to the production of the 
effect of which they are vulgarly treated as the mere 
theatre. All the positive conditions of a phenome- 
non are alike agents, alike active ; and in any expres- 
sion of the cause which professes to be a complete 
one, none of them can with reason be excluded, 
except such as have already been imphed in the words 
used for describing the effect ; nor by including even 
these would there be incurred any but a merely verbal 
inconsistency. \ 

§ 5. It now remains to advert to a distinction 
which is of first-rate importance both for clearing up 
the notion of cause, and for obviating a very specious 
objection often made against the view which we have 
taken of the subject. 

When we define the cause of anything (in the 
only sense in which the present inquiry has any con- 
cern with causes,) to be 'Hhe antecedent which it inva- 
riably follows," we do not use this phrase as exactly 
synonymous with *' the antecedent which it invariably 
has followed in our past experience.*' Such a mode 
of viewing causation would be liable to the objection 
very plausibly urged by Dr. Reid, namely, that 
according to this doctrine night must be the cause of 
day, £md day the cause of night ; since these pheno- 
mena have invariably succeeded one another from the 
beginning of the world. But it is necessary to our 
using the word cause, that we should believe not only 
that the antecedent always has been followed by the 
consequent, but that, as long as the present constitu- 
tion of things endures, it always to7Z be so. And this

410 INDUCTION. 

would not be true of day and night. We do not 
believe that night will be followed by day under any 
imaginable circumstances, but only that it will be so, 
provided the sun rises above the horizon. If the sun 
ceased to rise, which, for aught we know, may be per- 
fectly compatible with the general laws of matter, 
night would be, or might be, eternal. On the other 
hand, if the sun is above the horizon, his light not 
extinct, and no opaque body between us and him, we 
believe firmly that unless a change takes place in the 
properties of matter, this combination of antecedents 
will be followed by the consequent, day ; that if the 
combination of antecedents could be indefinitely pro- 
longed, it would be always day ; and that if the same 
combination had always existed, it would always have 
been day, quite independently of night as a previous 
condition. Therefore is it that we do not call night 
the cause, nor even a condition, of day. The exist- 
ence of the sun (or some such luminous body), and 
there being np opaque medium in a straight line* 
between that body and the part of the earth where we 
are situated, are the sole conditions ; and the union of 
these, without the addition of any superfluous circum- 
stance, constitutes the cause. This is what writers 
mean when they say that the notion of cause in- 
volves the idea of necessity. If there be any mean- 
ing which confessedly belongs to the term necessity, it 
is unconditionalness. That which is necessary, that 
which must be, means that which will be, whatever 



* I use the words " straight line" for brevity and simplicity. 
In reality the line in question is not exactly straight, for, from the 
effects of refraction, we actually see the sun for a short interval 
during which the opaque mass of the earth is interposed in a direct 
line between the sun and our eyes ; thus realizing, though but to a 
limited extent, the coveted desideratum of seeing round a comer.

supposition we may make in regard to all other things. 
The succession of day and night evidently is not 
necessary in this sense. It is conditional upon the 
occurrence of other antecedents. That which will be 
followed by a given consequent when, and only when, 
some third circumstance also exists, is not the cause^ 
even although no case should have ever occurred in 
which the phenomenon took place without it. 

Invariable sequence, therefore, is not synonymous 
with causation, unless the sequence, besides beings 
invariable, is imconditional. There are sequences, as 
uniform in past experience as any others whatever, 
which yet we do not regard as cases of causation, but 
as conjunctions, in some sort accidental. Such, to a 
philosopher, is that of day and night. The one might 
have existed for any length of time, and the other not 
have followed the sooner for its existence ; it follows 
only if certain other antecedents exist; and where 
those antecedents existed, it would follow in any case. 
No one, probably, ever called night the cause of day; 
mankind must so soon have arrived at the very obvi- 
ous generalization, that the state of general illumina- 
tion which we call day would follow the presence of a 
sufficiently luminous body, whether darkness had pre- 
ceded or not. 

We may define, therefore, the cause of a phenome- 
non to be the antecedent, or the concurrence of ante- 
cedents, upon which it is invariably and unconditionally 
consequent. Or if we adopt the convenient modifi- 
cation of the meaning of the word cause, which con- 
fines it to the assemblage of positive conditions, with- 
out the negative, then instead of '* unconditionally/^ 
we must say, " subject to no other than negative 
conditions."

It is evident, that from a limited number of un- 
conditional sequences, there will result a much greater 
number of conditional ones. Certain causes being 
given, that is, certain antecedents which are uncon- 
ditionally followed by certain consequents ; the mere 
coexistence of these causes will give rise to an unli- 
mited number of additional uniformities. If two 
causes exist together, the effects of both wdll exist 
together ; and if many causes coexist, these causes (by 
what we shall term hereafter, the intermixture of their 
laws) will give rise to new effects, accompanying or 
succeeding one another in some particular order, 
which order will be invariable while the causes con- 
tinue to coexist, but no longer. The motion of the 
earth in a given orbit round the sun is a series of 
changes which follow one another as antecedents and 
consequents, and will continue to do so while the sun's 
attraction, and the force with which the earth tends to 
advance in a direct line through space, continue to 
coexist in the same quantities as at present. But 
vary either of these causes, and the unvarjring succes- 
sion of motions would cease to take place. The series 
of the earth's motions, therefore, though a case of 
sequence invariable within the limits of human expe- 
rience, is not a case of causation. It is not uncon- 
ditional. 

To distinguish these conditionally uniform se- 
quences from those which are uniform uncondition- 
ally; to ascertain whether an apparently invariable 
antecedent of some consequent is really one of its 
conditions, or whether, in the absence of that antece- 
dent, the effect would equally have followed from some 
other portion of the circumstances which are present 
whenever it occurs ; is a principal part of the great

problem of Induction ; and is one of those questions, 
the principles of the solution of which will, it is to be 
hoped, result from the inquiry we have undertaken. 

^ 6. Does a cause always stand with its effect in 
the relation of antecedent and consequent ? Do we 
not often say of two simultaneous facts that they are 
cause and effect — as when we say that fire is the 
cause of warmth, the sun and moisture the cause of 
vegetation, and the like ? It is certain that a cause 
does not necessarily perish because its effect has been 
produced ; the two, therefore, do very generally 
coexist ; and there are some appearances, and some 
common expressions, seeming to imply not only that 
causes may, but that they must, be contemporaneous 
with their effects. Cessante causdy cessat et effecttis, 
has been a dogma of the schools : the necessity for 
the continued existence of the cause in order to the 
continuance of the effect, seems to have been once . a 
general doctrine among philosophers. Mr. Whewell 
observes that Kepler's numerous attempts to account 
for the motion of the heavenly bodies on mechanical 
principles, were rendered abortive by his always sup- 
posing that the force which set those bodies in motion 
must continue to operate in order to keep up the 
motion which it at first produced. Yet there were at 
all times many familiar instances in open contradiction 
to this supposed axiom. A coup de soldi gives a man 
a brain fever : will the fever go off as soon as he is 
moved out of the sunshine ? A sword is run through 
his body : must the sword remain in his body in order 
that he may continue dead? A ploughshare once 
made, remains a ploughshare, without any continuance 
of heating and hammering, and even after the man 
who heated and hammered it has been gathered to his

fathers. On the other hand, the pressure which forces 
up the mercury in an exhausted tube must be con* 
tinned in order to sustain it in the tube. This (it may 
be repUed,) is because another force is acting without 
intermission, the force of gravity, which would restore 
it to its level, unless counterpoised by a force equally 
constant. But again ; a tight bandage causes pain, 
which pain will sometimes go off as soon as the ban- 
dage is removed. The illumination which the sun 
diffuses over the earth ceases when the sun goes 
down. 

The solution of these difficulties will be foimd in 
a very simple distinction. The conditions which are 
necessary for the first production of a phenomenon, 
are occasionally also necessary for its continuance; 
but more commonly its continuance requires no con- 
dition except negative ones. Most things, once pro- 
duced, continue as they are, until something changes 
or destroys them ; but some require the permanent 
presence of the agencies which produced them at first. 
These may, if we please, be considered as instanta- 
neous phenomena, requiring to be renewed at each 
instant by the cause by which they were at first gene- 
rated. Accordingly, the illumination of any given 
point of space has always been looked upon as an 
instantaneous fact, which perishes and is perpetually 
renewed as long as the necessary conditions subsist. 
If we adopt this language we are enabled to avoid 
admitting that the continuance of the cause is ever 
required to maintain the effect. We may say, it is 
not required to maintain but to reproduce the effect, 
or else to counteract some force tending to destroy it. 
And this may be a convenient phraseology. But it is 
only a phraseology. The fact remains, that in some 
oases (though these are a minority,) the continuance

LAW OF CAUSATION. 415 

of the conditions which produced an effect is necessary 
to the continuance of the effect. 

As to the ulterior question, whether it is strictly 
necessary that the cause, or assemblage of conditions, 
should precede, by ever so short an instant, the pro- 
duction of the effect, (a question raised and argued 
with much ingenuity by a writer from whom we have 
quoted*,) we think the inquiry an unimportant one. 
There certainly are cases in which the effect follows 
without any interval perceptible to our faculties ; and 
when there is an interval we cannot tell by how many 
intermediate links imperceptible to us that interval may 
really be filled up. But even granting that an effect 
may commence simultaneously with its cause, the view 
I have taken of causation is in noway practically affected. 
Whether the cause and its effect be necessarily suc- 
cessive or not, causation is still the law of the succes- 
sion of phenomena. Everything which begins to 
exist must have a cause ; what does not begin to exist 
does not need a cause ; what causation has to account 
for is the origin of phenomena, and all the successions 
of phenomena must be resolvable into causation. 
These are the axioms of our doctrine. If these be 
granted, we can afford, though T see no necessity 
for doing so, to drop the words antecedent and con- 
sequent as applied to cause and effect. I have no 
objection to define a cause, the assemblage of pheno- 
mena, which occurring, some other phenomenon inva- 
riably commences, or has its origin. Whether the 
effect coincides in point of time with, or immediately 
follows, the hindmost of its conditions, is immaterial. 
At all events it does not precede it ; and when we are 
in doubt, between two coexistent phenomena, which

is cause and which effect, we rightly deem the ques- 
tion solved if we can ascertain which of them pre 
ceded the other. 

^ 7. It continually happens that several different 
phenomena, which are not in the slightest degree 
dependent or conditional upon one another, are found 
all to depend, as the phrase is, upon one and the same 
agent ; in other words, one and the same phenomenon 
is seen to be followed by several sorts of effects quite 
heterogeneous, but which go on simultaneously one 
with another ; provided, of course, that all other con- 
ditions requisite for each of them also exist. Thus, 
the sun produces the celestial motions, it produces 
dayUght, and it produces heat. The earth causes the 
fall of heavy bodies, and it also, in its capacity of an 
immense magnet, causes the phenomena of the mag- 
netic needle. A crystal of galena causes the sensa- 
tions of hardness, of weight, of cubical form, of grey 
colour, and many others between which we can trace 
no interdependence. The purpose to which the phra- 
seology of Properties and Powers is specially adapted, 
is the expression of this sort of cases. When the 
same phenomenon is followed (either subject or not to 
the presence of other conditions,) by effects of different 
and dissimilar orders, it is usual to say that each dif- 
ferent sort of effect is produced by a different property 
of the cause. Thus we distinguish the attractive, or 
gravitative, property of the earth, and its magnetic 
property; the gravitative, luminiferous, and calori6c 
properties of the sun ; the colour, shape, weight, and 
hardness of the crystal. These are mere phrases, 
which explain nothing, and add nothing to our know- 
ledge of the subject; but, considered as abstract 
names denoting the connexion between the different

effects produced and the object which produces thein, 
they are a very powerful instrument of abridgment, 
and of that acceleration of the process of thought 
which abridgment accomplishes. 

This class of considerations leads us to a con- 
ception which we shall find of great importance in 
the interpretation of nature; that of a Permanent 
Cause, or original natural agent. There exist in 
nature a number of permanent causes, which have 
subsisted ever since the human race has been in 
existence, and for an indefinite and probably enormous 
length of time previous. The sun, the earth and 
planets, with their various constituents, air, water, and 
the other distinguishable substances, whether simple 
or compound, of which nature is made up, are such 
Permanent Causes. These have existed^ and the 
effects or consequences which they were fitted to pro- 
duce have taken place, (as often as the other condi- 
tions of the production met,) from the very beginning of 
our experience. But we can give, scientifically speak- 
ing, no account of the origin of the Permanent Causes 
themselves. Why these particular natural agents 
existed originally and no others, or why they are 
commingled in such and such proportions, and dis- 
tributed in such and such a manner throughout space, 
is a question we cannot answer. More than this : we 
can discover nothing regular in the distribution itself; 
we can reduce it to no uniformity, to no law. There 
are no means by which, from the distribution of these 
causes or agents in one part of space, we could conjec- 
ture whether a similar distribution prevails in another. 
The coexistence, therefore, of Primeval Causes, ranks, 
to us, among merely casual concurrences : and all those 
sequences or coexistences among the effects of several 
such causes, which, though invariable while those

causes coexist, would, if the coexistence terminated, 
terminate along with it, we do not class as cases of 
causation, or laws of nature : we can only calculate 
upon finding these sequences or coexistences where we 
know, by direct evidence, that the natural agents on 
the properties of which they ultimately depend, are 
distributed in the requisite manner. These Perma- 
nent Causes are not always objects ; they are some- 
times events, that is to say, periodical cycles of events, 
that being the only mode in which events can possess 
the property of permanence. Not only, for instance, 
is the earth itself a permanent cause, or primitive 
natural agent, but the earth's rotation is so too : it is 
a cause which has produced, from the earliest period, 
<by the aid of other necessary conditions) the succes- 
sion of day and night, the ebb and flow of the sea, 
and many other effects, while, as we can assign no 
eause (except conjecturally) for the rotation itself, it 
is entitled to be ranked as a primeval cause. It is, 
however, only the origin of the rotation which is 
mysterious to us : once begun, its continuance is 
¦accounted far by the first law of motion (that of the 
permanence of rectilineal motion once impressed) 
combined with the gravitation of the parts of the 
«arth towards one another. 

All phenomena without exception which begin to 
exist, that is, all except the primeval causes, are 
•effects either immediate or remote of those primitive 
facts, or of some combination of them. There is no 
I'hing produced, no event happening, in the universe, 
which is not connected by an uniformity, or invariable 
sequence, with some one or more of the phenomena 
which preceded it; insomuch that it will happen again 
as often as those phenomena occur again, and as no 
other phenomenon having the character of a counter-

acting cause shall coexist. These antecedent pheno- 
mena^ again, were connected in a similar manner with 
some that preceded them ; and so on, until we reach, as 
the ultimate step, either the properties of some one 
primeval cause, or the conjunction <rf several* The 
whole of the phenomena of nature were therefore the 
necessary, or in other words, the unconditional, con- 
sequences of the ori^al coUocation of the Permanent 
Causes. 

The state of the whole universe at any instant, we 
believe to be the consequence of its state at the 
previous instant ; insomuch that if we knew all the 
agents which exist at the present moment, their coUo- 
cation in space, and their properties, in other words 
the laws of their agency, we could predict the whole 
subsequent history of the universe, at least unless some 
new volition of a power capable of controlling the 
universe should supervene*. And if any particular 



'^ To the universality which mankind are agreed in ascribing 
to the Law of Causation, there is one chtim of exception, one dis- 
puted case, that of the Human Will; the determinations of which a 
large class of metaphysicians are not willing to regard as following 
the causes called motives, according to as strict laws as those which 
they suppose to exist in the world of mere matter. This contro- 
verted point will undergo a special examination when we come to 
treat particularly of the Logic of the Moral Sciences, (Book vi.,

who, it must be observed, ground the main part of their objection 
upon the supposed repugnance of the doctrine in question to our 
consciousness, seem to me to mistake the fact which consciousness 
testifies against. What is really in contradiction to consciousness, 
they would, I think, on strict self-examination, find to be, the 
application to human actions and volitions of the ideas involved in 
the common use of the term Necessity ; which I agree with them 
in thinking highly objectionable. But if they would consider that 
by saying that a man's actions necessarily follow from his character,

state of the entire universe should ever recur a second 
tune, (which, however, all experience combines to 
assure us will never happen,) all subsequent states 
would return too, and history would, like a circulating 
decimal of many figures, periodically repeat itself: —

And though things do not really revolve in this 
eternal round, the whole series of events in the history 
of the universe, past and future, is not the less capable, 
in its own nature, of being constructed d priori by any 
one whom we can suppose acquainted with the original 
distribution of all natural agents, and with the whole 
of their properties, that is, the laws of succession 
existing between them and their effects: saving the 
infinitely more than human powers of combination 
and calculation which would be required, even in one 
possessing the data, for the actual performance of the 
task.

is determined by laws of causation and collocations of

this is contended for by any one but an Asiatic fatalist.

^e]l of coexistence as of succession, among the 
effects ; but these must in all cases be a mere result 
either of the identity or of the coexistence of their 
causes : if the causes did not coexist, neither could 
the effects. And these causes being also effects of 
prior causes, and these of others, until we reach the 
primeval causes, it follows that (except in the case of 
effects which can be traced immediately or remotely 
to one and the same cause), the coexistences of pheno- 
mena can in no case be universal, unless the coexist- 
ences of the primeval causes to which the effects are 
ultimately traceable, can be reduced to an universal 
law : but we have seen that they cannot. There are, 
accordingly, no original and independent, in other 
words, no unconditional, uniformities of coexistence 
between effects of different causes ; if they coexist, it 
is only because the causes have casually coexisted. 
The only independent and unconditional coexistences 
which are sufficiently invariable to have any claim to 
the character of laws, are between different and 
mutually independent effects of the same cause ; in 
other words, between different properties of the same 
natural agent. This portion of the Laws of Nature 
will be treated of in the latter part of the present 
Book, under the name of the Specific Properties of 
Kinds. 

$ 9. Before concluding this chapter, it seems 
desirable to take notice of an apparent, but not a real, 
opposition between the doctrines which I have laid 
down respecting causation, and those maintained in a 
work which I hold to be far the greatest yet produced 
on the Philosophy of the Sciences, M. Comte's Cours 
de Philosophic Positive. M. Comte asserts as his 
first principle, that the causes of phenomena are

422 INDUCTION. 

beyond the reach of the human faculties, and that att 
which is accessible to us is their laws^ or, as he ex- 
plains the term, their constant relations of succession 
or of similarity. Accordingly M. Comte sedulously 
abstains, in the subsequent part of his work, from the 
use of the word Cause: an example which I have not 
followed, for reasons which I will proceed to state. 
I most fully agree with M. Comte that ultimate, or, in 
the phraseology of metaphysicians, efficient causes, 
which are conceived as not being phenomena, nor per- 
ceptible by the senses at all, are radically inaccessible 
to the human faculties: and that the ''constant 
relations of succession or of similarity" which exist 
among phenomena themselves, (not forgetting, so far 
as any constancy can be traced, their relations of 
coexistence,) are the only subjects of rational investi- 
gation. When I speak of causation, I have nothing 
in view, other than those constant relations : but I 
think the terms causation, and cause and effect, 
important to be preserved, for the purpose of dis- 
tinctively designating one class of those relations, 
namely the relations of succession which so far as 
we know are unconditional; as contrasted with those 
which> Uke the succession of day and night, depend 
upon the existence or upon the coexistence of other 
antecedent facts. This distinction corresponds to the 
great division which Mr. Whewell and other writers 
have made of the field of science, into the investigation 
of what they term the Laws of Phenomena, and the 
investigation of causes ; a phraseology, as I conceive, 
altogether vicious, inasmuch as the ascertainment of 
causes, such causes as the human faculties can ascer- 
tain, namely causes which are themselves phenomena, 
is, therefore, merely the ascertainment of other and 
more universal Laws of Phenomena. And I cannot

but look upon the revival, on English soil, ot the 
doctrine (not only refuted by the school of Locke and 
Hume^ but given up by their great rivals Reid and 
Stewart) that efficient causes are within the reach of 
human knowledge, as a remarkable instance of what 
has been aptly called " the peculiar zest which the 
spirit of reaction against modem tendencies gives to 
ancient absurdities." 

Yet the distinction between those constant rela- 
tions of succession or coexistence which Mr. Whe- 
well terms Laws of Phenomena, and those which 
he terms, as I do, Laws of Causation, is grounded 
(however incorrectly expressed) upon a real diflference* 
It is no doubt with great injustice that Mr. Whewell 
(who has evidently g^ven only a most partial and 
cursory inspection to M. Comte's work,) assumes that 
M. Comte has overlooked this fundamental distinction, 
and that by excluding the investigation of causes, he 
excludes that of all the most general truths. No one 
really acquainted with M. Comte's admirable specu- 
lations could have so completely misapprehended their 
whole spirit and purport. But it does appear to me 
that his disinclination to employ the word Cause has 
occasionally led him to attach less importance than it 
deserves to this great distinction, upon which alone, 
I am convinced, the possibility rests of framing a 
rigorous Canon of Induction. Nor do I see what is 
gained by avoiding this particular word, when M. 
Comte is forced, like other people, to speak continually 
of the properties of things, of agents and their action^ 
of forces and the like; terms equally liable .to per- 
version, and which are partial and inadequate expres- 
sions for what no word that we possess, except Cause, 
expresses in its full generality. I believe, too, that 
when the ideas which a word is commonly used to

convey are overclouded with mysticism, the obscmity 
is not likely to be so effectually dispelled by abstaining 
from its employment, as by bringing out into full 
clearness the portion of real meaning which exists in 
the various cases where the term is most familiarly 
employed, and thereby giving a legitimate satisfaction 
to that demand of the intellect which has caused the 
term to remain in use.

$ 1. To complete the general notion of causation 
on which the rules of experimental inquiry into the 
laws of nature must be founded, one distinction still 
remains to be pointed out: a distinction so funda- 
mentaly and of so much importance, as to require a 
chapter to itself. 

The preceding discussions have rendered us fami- 
liar with the case in which several agents, or causes, 
concur as conditions to the production of an effect ; a 
case, in truths almost universal, there being very few 
effects to the production of which no more than one 
agent contributes. Suppose, then, that two different 
agents, operating jointly, are fpUowed, under a certain 
set of collateral conditions, by a given efiect. K either 
of these agents, instead of being joined with the 
other, had operated alone, under the same set of condi- 
tions in all other respects, some effect would probably 
have followed ; which would have been different from 
the joint effect of the two, and more or less dissimilar 
to it. Now, if we happen to know what would be the 
effects of each cause when acting separately from the 
other, we are often able to arrive deductively, or d 
priori J at a correct prediction of what will arise from 
their conjunct agency. To enable us to do this, it is 
only necessary that the same law which expresses the 
effect of each cause acting by itself, shall also cor- 
rectly express the part due to that cause, of the effect 
which /oUows from the two together. This con- 
dition is realised in the extensive and important

class of phenomena commonly called mechanical, 
namely the phenomena of the communication of 
motion (or of pressure, which is tendency to motion) 
from one body to another. In this important class 
of cases of causation, one cause never, properly 
speaking, defeats or frustrates another; both have their 
full effect If a body is propelled in two directions by 
two forces, one tending to drive it to the north, and 
the other to the east, it is caused to move in a given 
time exactly as far in both directions as the two forces 
would separately have carried it ; and is left precisely 
where it would have arrived if it had been acted upon 
first by one of the two forces, and afterwards by the 
other. This law of nature is called, in mechanical 
philosophy, the principle of the Composition of Forces: 
and in imitation of that well-chosen expression, I shall 
give the name of the Composition of Causes to the 
principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the 
joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum 
of their separate effects. 

This principle, however, by no means prevails in 
all departments of the field of nature. The chemical 
combination of two substances produces, as is well 
known, a third substance with properties entirely 
different from those of either of the two substances 
separately, or of both of them taken together. Not a 
trace of the properties of hydrogen or of oxygen is 
observable in those of their compound, water. The 
taste of sugar of lead is not the sum of the tastes of 
its component elements, acetic acid and lead or its 
oxide ; nor is the colour of green vitriol a mixture of 
the colours of sulphuric acid and copper. This explains 
why mechanics is a deductive or demonstrative science, 
and chemistry not. In the one, we can compute the 
effects of all combiuations of causes, whether real or

COMPOSITION OF CAUSES. 427 

hypothetical, from the laws which we know to govern 
those causes when acting separately; because they 
continue to observe the same laws when in combina- 
tion, which they observed when separate: whatever 
would have happened in consequence of each cause 
taken by itself, happens when they are together, 
and we have only to cast up the results. Not so 
in the phenomena which are the peculiar subject of 
the science of chemistry. There, most of the unifor- 
mities to which the causes conformed when separate, 
cease altogether when they are conjoined; and we are 
not, at least in the present state of our knowledge, 
able to foresee what result will follow from any new 
combination, until we have tried it by specific expe* 
riment. 

K this be true of chemical combinations, it is still 
more true of those far more complex combinations of 
elements which constitute organised bodies; and in 
which those extraordinary new uniformities arise, 
which are called the laws of life. All organised 
bodies are composed of parts, similar to those 
composing inorganic nature, and which have even 
themselves existed in an inorganic state; but the 
phenomena of life, which result from the juxtaposition 
of those parts in a certain manner, bear no analogy to 
any of the effects which would be produced by the 
action of the component substances considered as 
mere physical agents. To whatever degree we might 
imagine our knowledge of the properties of the several 
ingredients of a living body to be extended and per- 
fected, it is certain that no mere summing up of the 
separate actions of those elements will ever amount to 
the action of the living body itself. The tongue, for 
instance, is, like all other parts of the animal frame, 
composed of gelatine, fibrin, and other products of the

chemistry of digestion, but from no knowledge of the 
properties of those substances could we ever predict 
that it could taste, unless gelatine or fibrin could 
themselves taste; for no elementary fact can be 
in the conclusion, which was not first in the pre- 
misses. 

There are thus two difierent modes of the conjunct 
/, action of causes ; from which arise two modes of con- 
flict, or mutual interference, between laws of nature. 
Suppose, at a given point of time and space, two or 
more causes, which, if they acted separately, would 
produce efiects contrary, or at least conflicting with 
each other ; one of them tending to undo, wholly or 
partially, what the other tends to do. Thus, the expan- 
sive force of the gases generated by the ignition of 
gunpowder tends to project a bullet towards the sky, 
while its gravity tends to make it fiall to the ground. 
A stream running into a reservoir at one end tends to 
fill it higher and higher, while a drain at the other 
extremity tends to empty it. Now, in such cases as 
these, even if the two causes which are in joint action 
exactly annul one another, still the laws of both are 
fulfilled ; the efiect is the same as if the drain had 
been open for half an hour first*, and the stream had 
flowed in for as long afterwards. Each agent pro- 
duced the same amount of effect as if it had acted 
separately, though the contrary effect which was 
taking place during the same time obliterated it as 
fast as it was produced. Here, then, we have two 
causes, producing by their joint operation an effect 



* I omit, for simplicity, to take into account the effect, in this 
latter case, of the diminution of pressure, in diminishing the flow of 
the water through the drain; which evidently in no way affects the 
truth or applicability of the principle.

which at first seems quite dissimilar to those which 
they produce separately, but which on examination 
proves to be really the sum of those separate effects. 
It will be noticed that we here enlarge the idea of 
the sum of two effects, so as to include what is com- 
monly called their difference, but which is in reaUty 
the result of the addition of opposites ; a conception 
to which, as is well known, mankind are indebted for 
that admirable extension of the algebraical calculus, 
which has so vastly increased its powers as an instru- 
ment of discovery, by introducing into its reasonings 
(with the sign of subtraction prefixed, and under the 
name of Negative Quantities) every description what- 
ever of positive phenomena, provided they are of such 
a quality in reference to those previously introduced, 
that to add the one is equivalent to subtracting an 
equal quantity of the other. 

There is, then, one mode of the mutual inter- 
ference of laws of nature in which, even when the 
concurrent causes annihilate each other's effects, each 
exerts its full efficacy according to its own law, its 
law as a separate agent. But in the other description 
of cases, the two agencies which are brought together 
cease entirely, and a totally different set of phenomena 
arise: as in the experiment of two liquids which, 
when mixed in certain proportions, instantly become 
a solid mass, instead of merely a larger amount of 
liquid. 

§ 2. This difference between the case in which the 
joint effect of causes is the sum of their separate effects, 
and the case in which it is heterogeneous to them ; 
between laws which work together without alteration, 
and laws which, when called upon to work toge- 
ther, cease and give place to others; is one of the

430 INDUCTION. 

fundamental distinctions in nature. The former case^ 
that of the Composition of Causes, is the general one ; 
the other is always special and exceptional. There 
are no objects which do not, as to some of their phe- 
nomena, obey the principle of the Composition of 
Causes; none that have not some laws which are 
rigidly fulfilled in every combination into which the 
objects enter. The weight of a body, for instance, is 
a property which it retains in all the combinations in 
which it is placed. The weight of a chemical com- 
pound, or of an organized body, is equal to the sum 
of the weights of the elements which compose it. 
The weight either of the elements or of the compound 
will vary, if they be carried farther from their centre 
of attraction, or brought nearer to it ; but whatever 
affects the one affects the other. They always re- 
main precisely equal. So again, the component parts 
of a vegetable or animal substance do not lose their 
mechanical and chemical properties as separate agents, . 
when, by a peculiar mode of juxta-position, they, as 
an aggregate whole, acquire physiological or vital pro- 
perties in addition. Those bodies continue, as before, 
to obey mechanical and chemical laws, in so far as the 
operation of those laws is not counteracted by the 
new laws which govern them as organized beings. 
When, in short, a concurrence of causes takes place 
which calls into action new laws, bearing no analogy 
to any that we can trace in the separate operation of 
the causes, the new laws may supersede one portion 
of the previous laws but coexist with another portion, 
and may even compound the effect of those previous 
laws with their own. 

Again, laws which were themselves generated in 
the second mode, may generate others in the first. 
Though there be laws which, like those of chemistry

and physiology, owe their existence to a breach of the 
principle of Composition of Causes, it does not follow 
that these pecuhar, or as they might be termed, 
heteropathic laws, are not capable of composition with 
one another. The causes which by one combination 
have had their laws altered, may carry their new laws 
with them unaltered into their ulterior combinations. 
And hence there is no reason to despair of ultimately 
raising chemistry and physiology to the condition of 
deductive sciences; for though it is impossible to 
deduce all chemical and physiological truths from the 
laws or properties of simple substances or elementary 
agents, they may probably be deducible from laws 
which commence when these elementary agents are 
brought together into some moderate number of not 
very complex combinations. The Laws of Life will 
never be deducible from the mere laws of the ingre- 
dients, but the prodigiously complex Facts of Life may 
all be deducible from comparatively simple laws of 
life ; which laws, (depending indeed upon combinations, 
but upon comparatively simple combinations, of ante- 
cedents,) may in more complex circumstances be 
strictly compoimded with one another, and with the 
physical and chemical laws of the ingredients. The 
details of the vital phenomena even now afford innu- 
merable exemplifications of the Composition of Causes ; 
and in proportion as these phenomena are more accu- 
rately studied, there appears more and more reason 
to believe that the same laws which operate in the 
simpler combinations of circumstances do, in fact, 
continue to be observed in the more complex *. This

will be found equally true in the phenomena of mind ; 
and even in social and political phenomena, the result 
of the laws of mind. It is in the case of chemical 
phenomena that the least progress has yet been made 
in bringing the special laws under general ones from 
which they may be deduced ; but there are even in 
chemistry many circumstances to encourage the hope 
that such general laws will hereafter be discovered. 
The diflferent actions of a chemical compound will 
never, undoubtedly, be found to be the sum of the 
actions of its separate elements; but there may exist, be- 
tween the properties of the compound and those of its 
elements, some constant relation, which if discover- 
able by a sufficient induction, would enable us to 
foresee the sort of compound which will result from a 
new combination before we have actually tried it, and 
to judge of what sort of elements some new substance 
is compounded before we have analyzed it : a pro- 
blem, the solution of which has been propounded by 
M. Comte as the ideal aim and purpose of chemical 
speculation. The great law of definite proportions, 
first discovered in its full generality by Dalton, is a 
complete solution of this problem in one single aspect 
(of secondary importance it is true), that of quantity : 



his treatise on General Physiology^ in which the highest gene- 
ralizations which the science of life has yet reached, and the 
best modem conception of that science as a whole, are exhibited 
in a manner equally perspicuous and philosophical. On the details 
of such a treatise the present writer would be' an incompetent wit- 
ness ; these however have been sufficiently vouched for by some 
of the highest living authorities ; while of the genuinely scientific 
spirit which pervades it, those may be permitted to express an 
opinion, who would not be entitled to offer to a work on such a 
subject, any other praise.

COMPOSITION OF CAUSES. 433 

and in respect to quality, we have already some par- 
tial generalizations sufficient to indicate the possibility 
of ultimately proceeding further. We can predicate 
many common properties of the kind of compounds 
which result from the combination, in each of the 
small number of possible proportions, of any acid 
whatever with any base. We have also the very 
curious law, discovered by Berthollet, that two 
soluble salts mutually decompose one another when- 
ever the new combinations which result produce an 
insoluble compound; or one less soluble than the two 
former. Another uniformity has been observed, com- 
monly called the law of isomorphism ; the identity of 
the crystaUine forms of substances which possess in 
common certain pecuUarities of chemical composition. 
Thus it appears that even heteropathic laws, such 
laws of combined agency as are not compounded of 
the laws of the separate agencies, are yet, at least in 
some cases, derived from them according to a fixed 
principle. There may, therefore, be laws of the gene- 
ration of laws from others dissimilar to them ; and in 
chemistry, these undiscovered laws of the dependence 
of the properties of the compound on the properties of 
its elements, may, together with the laws of the ele- 
ments themselves, furnish the premisses by which the 
science is destined one day to be rendered deductive. 

It would seem, therefore, that there is no class of 
phenomena in which the Composition of Causes does 
not obtain : that as a generd rule, causes in combina- 
tion produce exactly the same effects as when acting 
singly: but that this rule, though general, is not 
universal : that in some instances, at some particular 
points in the transition from separate to united action, 
the laws change, and an entirely new set of effects are 
either added to, or take the place of, those which

434 INDUCTION. 

arise from the separate agency of the same causes : 
the laws of these new effects being again susceptible 
of composition, to an indefinite extent, like the laws 
which they superseded. 

§ 3. That effects are proportional to their causes 
is laid down, by some writers, as an axiom in the 
theory of causation ; and great use is sometimes made 
of this principle in reasonings respecting the laws of 
nature, although it is incumbered with many difficul- 
ties and apparent exceptions, which much ingenuity 
has been expended in showing not to be real ones. 
This proposition, in so far as it is true, enters as a 
particular case into the general principle of the Com- 
position of Causes : the causes compounded being, in 
this instance, homogeneous ; in which case, if in any, 
their joint effect might be expected to be identical 
with the sum of their separate effects. K a force 
equal to one hundred weight, will raise a certain body 
along an inclined plane, a force equal to two himdred 
weight will, we know, raise two bodies exactly similar, 
and thus the effect is proportional to the cause. But 
does not a force equal to two hundred weight, actually 
contain in itself two forces each equal to one hundred 
weight, which, if employed apart, would separately 
raise the two bodies in question ? The fact, therefore, 
that when exerted jointly they raise both bodies at once, 
results from the Composition of Causes, and is a mere 
instance of the general fact that mechanical forces are 
subject to the law of Composition. And so in every 
other case which can be supposed. For the doctrine 
of the proportionality of effects to their causes cannot 
of course be applicable to cases in which the augmen- 
tation of the cause alters the kind of effect ; that is, 
in which the surplus quantity superadded to the cause

COMPOSITION OF CAUSES. 435 

does not become compounded with it, but the two 
together generate an altogether new phenomenon. 
Suppose that the application of a certain quantity of 
heat to a body merely increases its bulk, that a double 
quantity melts it, and a triple quantity decomposes 
it : these three effects being heterogeneous, no ratio, 
whether corresponding or not to that of the quantities 
of heat applied, can be established between them. 
Thus we see that the supposed axiom of the pro- 
portionality of effects to their causes fails at the 
precise point where the principle of the Composi- 
tion of Causes also fails; viz., where the concur- 
rence of causes is such as to determine a change in 
the properties of the body generally, and render it 
subject to new laws, more or less dissimilar to those 
to which it conformed in its previous state of exist- 
ence. The recognition, therefore, of any such law of 
proportionality, is superseded by the more compre- 
hensive principle, in which as much of it as is true is 
implicitly asserted. 

The general remarks on causation, which seemed 
necessary as an introduction to the theory of the 
inductive process, may here terminate. That process 
is essentially an inquiry into cases of causation. All 
the uniformities which exist in the succession of phe- 
nomena, and most of those which prevail in their 
coexistence, are either, as we have seen, themselves 
laws of causation, or consequences resulting from, and 
corollaries capable of being deduced from, such laws. 
If we could determine what causes are correctly as- 
signed to what effects, and what effects to what 
causes, we should be virtually acquainted with the 
whole course of nature. All those uniformities which 
are mere rejsults of causation, might then be explained 
and accounted for ; and every individual fact or event

436 INDUCTION. 

might be predicted, provided we had the requisite 
data, that is, the requisite knowledge of the circum- 
stances which, in the particular instance, preceded it. 

To ascertain, therefore, what are the laws of cau- 
sation which exist in nature ; to determine the effects 
of every cause, and the causes of all effects, — ^is the 
main business of Induction; and to point out how 
, this is done is the chief object of Inductive Logic. .

Chapter VII. 
OF OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT. 

$ 1. It results from the preceding exposition, that 
the process of ascertaining what consequents, in nature, 
are invariably connected with what antecedents, or 
in other words what phenomena are related to each 
other as causes and effects, is in some sort a process of 
analysis. That every fact which begins to exist has 
a cause, and that this cause must be found some- 
where among the facts which immediately preceded 
its occurrence, may be taken for certain. The whole 
of the present facts are the infallible result of all past 
facts, and more immediately of all the facts which 
existed at the moment previous. Here, then, is a 
great sequence, which we know to be uniform. If 
the whole prior state of the entire universe could 
again recur, it would again be followed by the whole 
present state. The question is, how to resolve this 
complex uniformity into the simpler uniformities which 
compose it, and assign to each portion of the vast 
antecedent that portion of the consequent which is 
attendant upon it. 

This operation, which we have called analytical, 
inasmuch as it is the resolution of a complex whole 
into the component elements, is more than a merely 
mental analysis. No mere contemplation of the phe- 
nomena, and partition of them by the intellect alone, 
will of itself accompUsh the end we have now in view. 
Nevertheless, such a mental partition is an indispen- 
sable first step. The order of nature, as perceived at 
a first glance, presents at every instant a chaos followed 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



438 INDUCTION. 

by another chaos. We must decompose each chaos 
into single facts. We must learn to see in the chaotic 
antecedent a multitude of distinct antecedents, in the 
chaotic consequent a multitude of distinct conse- 
quents. This, supposing it done, will not of itself 
tell us on which of the antecedents each consequent is 
invariably attendant. To determine that point, we 
must endeavour to effect a separation of the facts 
from one another, not in our minds only, but in 
nature. The mental analysis, however, must take 
place first. And every one knows that in the mode of 
performing it, one intellect differs immensely from 
another. It is the essence of the act of observing ; 
for the observer is not he who merely sees the thing 
which is before his eyes, but he who sees what parts 
that thing is composed of. To do this well is a rare 
talent. One person, from inattention, or attending 
only in the wrong place, overiooks half of what he 
sees; another sets down much more than he sees, 
confounding it with what he imagines, or with what 
he infers ; another takes note of the kind of all the 
circumstances, but being inexpert in estimating their 
degree, leaves the quantity of each vague and uncer* 
tain ; another sees indeed the whole, but makes such 
an awkward division of it into parts, throwing things 
into one mass which require to be separated, and 
separating others which might more conveniently be 
considered as one, that the result is much the same, 
sometimes even worse, than if no analysis had been 
attempted at all. It would be possible to point out 
what qualities of mind, and modes of mental culture, 
fit a person for being a good observer ; that, however, 
is a question not of Logic, but of the theory of Educa- 
tion, in the most enlarged sense of the term. There 
is not properly an Art of Observing. There may 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT. 439 

be rules for observing. But these, like rules for 
inventing, are properly instructions for the prepara- 
tion of one's own mind ; for putting it into the state 
in which it will be most fitted to observe, or most 
likely to invent. They are, therefore, essentially 
rules of self-education, which is a different thing 
from Logic. They do not teach how to do the thing, 
but how to make ourselves capable of doing it. They 
are an art of strengthening the limbs, not an art of 
using them. 

The extent and minuteness of observation which 
may be requisite, and the degree of decomposition to 
which it may be necessary to carry the mental ana- 
lysis, depend upon the particular purpose in view. 
To ascertain the state of the whole universe at any 
particular moment is impossible, but would also be 
useless. In making chemical experiments, we should 
not think it necessary to note the position of the 
planets; because experience has shown, as a very 
superficial experience is sufficient to show, that in 
such cases that circumstance is not material to the 
result: and, accordingly, in the age when men believed 
in the occult influences of the heavenly bodies, it 
might have been imphilosophical to omit ascertaining 
the precise condition of those bodies at the moment of 
the experiment. As to the degree of minuteness of 
the mental sub-division ; if we were obliged to break 
down what we observe into its very simplest elements, 
that is, Uterally into single facts, it would be difficult 
to say where we should find them: we can hardly 
ever affirm that our divisions of any kind have reached 
the ultimate unit. But this, too, is fortunately unne- 
cessary. The only object of the mental separation is 
to suggest the requisite physical separation, so that 
we may either accomplish it ourselves, or seek for it 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



440 INDUCTION. 

in nature; and we have done enough when we have 
carried the sub-division as far as the point at which 
we are able to see what observations or experiments 
we require. It is only essential, at whatever point our 
mental decomposition of facts may for the present 
have stopped, that we should hold ourselves ready 
and able to carry it farther as occasion requires, and 
should not allow the freedom of onr discriminating 
faculty to be imprisoned by the swathes and bands of 
ordinary classification ; as was the case with all early 
speculative inquirers, not excepting the Greeks, to 
whom it hardly ever occurred that what was called 
by one abstract name might, in reality, be several 
phenomena, or that there was a possibility of decom- 
posing the facts of the universe into any elements 
but those which ordinary language already recog- 
nised. 

§ 2. The different antecedents and consequents 
being, then, supposed to be, so far as the case 
requires, ascertained and discriminated from one 
another ; we are to inquire which is connected with 
which. In every instance which comes under our 
observation, there are many antecedents and many 
consequents. If those antecedents could not be 
severed from one another except in thought, or if 
those consequents never were found apart, it would 
be impossible for us to distinguish {ct posteriori at 
least) the real laws, or to assign to any cause its 
effect, or to any effect its cause. To do so, we must 
be able to meet with some of the antecedents apart 
from the rest, and observe what follows from them ; 
or some of the consequents, and observe by what they 
are preceded. We must, in short, follow the Baco- 
nian rule of varying the circumstances. This is, indeed. 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT. 441 

only the first rule of physical inquiry, and not, as 
some have thought, the sole rule ; but it is the foun- 
dation of all the rest. 

For the purpose of varying the circumstances, we 
may have recourse (according to a distinction com- 
monly made) either to observation or to experiment ; 
we may either find an instance in nature, suited to 
our purposes, or, by an artificial arrangement of cir- 
cumstances, make one. The value of the instance 
depends upon what it is in itself, not upon the mode 
in which* it is obtained : its employment for the pur- 
poses of induction depends upon the same principles 
in the one case and in the other; as the uses of money 
are the same whether it is inherited or acquired. 
There is, in short, no diflFerence in kind, no real 
logical distinction^ between the two processes of 
investigation. There are, however, practical distinc- 
tions to which it is of considerable importance to 
advert. 

§ 3. The first and most obvious distinction 
between Observation and Experiment is, that the 
latter is an immense extension of the former. It not 
only enables us to produce a much greater number of 
variations in the circumstances than nature sponta- 
neously oflFers, but, moreover, in thousands of cases, 
to produce the precise sort of variation which we 
are in want of for discovering the law of the pheno- 
menon; a service which nature, being constructed on 
a quite difierent scheme from that of facilitating our 
studies, is seldom so friendly as to bestow upon us. 
For example, in order to ascertain what principle 
in the atmosphere enables it to sustain Ufe, the 
variation we require is that a living animal should be 
immersed in each component element of the atmo-

442 INDUCTION. - 

sphere separately. But nature does not supply either 
oxygen or azote in a separate state. We are indebted 
to artificial experiment for our knowledge that it is 
the former, and not the latter, which supports respi- 
ration; and even for our knowledge of the very 
existence of the two ingredients. 

Thus far the advantage of experimentation over 
simple observation is universally recognised : all are 
aware that it enables us to obtain innumerable combi- 
nations of circumstances which are not to be found in 
nature, and so add to nature's experiments a multitude 
of experiments of our own. But there is another 
superiority, (or, as Bacon would have expressed it, 
another prerogative) of instances artificially obtained 
over spontaneous instances, — of our own experiments 
over even the same experiments when made by 
nature, — ^which is not of less importance, and which 
is far from being felt and acknowledged in the same 
degree. 

When we can produce a phenomenon artificially, 
we can take it, as it were, home with us, and observe 
it in the midst of circumstances with which in all 
other respects we are accurately acquainted. K we 
desire to know what are the effects of the cause A, 
and are able to produce A by any means at our dis- 
posal, we can generally determine at our own discre- 
tion, so far as is compatible with the nature of the 
phenomenon A, the whole of the circumstances which 
shall be present along with it: and thus, knowing 
exactly the simultaneous state of everything else 
which is within the reach of A's influence, we have 
only to observe what alteration is made in that state 
by the presence of A. 

For example, by the electrical machine we can 
produce in the midst of known circumstances, the

OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT. 443 

phenomena which nature exhibits on a grander scale 
under the forni of lightning and thunder. Now let 
any one consider what amount of knowledge of the 
eflFects and laws of electric agency mankind could 
ever have obtained [from the mere observation of 
thunder-storms, and compare it with that which they 
have gained, and may expect to gain, from electrical 
and galvanic experiments. This example is the more 
striking, now that we have reason to believe that elec- 
tric action is of all natural pheliomena (except heat) 
the most pervading and universal, which, therefore, it 
might antecedently have been supposed could stand 
least in need of artificial means of production to 
enable it to be studied ; while the fact is so much the 
contrary, that without the electric machine, the voltaic 
battery, and the Leyden jar, we should never have 
suspected the existence of electricity as one of the 
great agents in nature ; the few electric phenomena 
we should have known of would have continued to be 
regarded either as supernatural, or as a sort of anoma- 
lies and eccentricities in the order of the universe. 

When we have succeeded in insulating the pheno- 
menon which is the subject of inquiry, by placing it 
among known circumstances, we may produce further 
variations of circumstances to any extent, and of such 
kinds as we think best calculated to bring the laws of 
the phenomenon into a clear light. By introducing 
one well defined circumstance after another into the 
experiment, we obtain assurance of the manner in 
which the phenomenon behaves under an indefinite 
variety of possible circumstances. Thus, chemists, 
after having obtained some newly-discovered sub- 
stance in a pure state, (that is, having made sure that 
there is nothing present which can interfere with and 
modify its agency,) introduce various other substances. 

Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



444 INDUCTION. 

one by one, to ascertain whether it will combine with 
them, or decompose them, and with what result ; and 
also apply heat, or electricity, or pressure, to discover 
what will happen to the substance under each of these 
circumstances. 

But if, on the other hand, it is out of our power 
to produce the phenomenon, and we have to seek for 
instances in which nature produces it, the task before 
us is one of quite another kind. Instead of being 
able to choose what' the concomitant circumstances 
shall be, we now have to discover what they are; 
which, when we go beyond the simplest and most 
accessible cases, it is next to impossible to do, with 
any precision and completeness. Let us take, as an 
exemplification of a phenomenon which we have no 
means of fabricating artificially, a human mind. Nature 
produces many ; but the consequence of our not being 
able to produce it by art is, that in every instance in 
which we see a human mind developing itself, or 
acting upon other things, we see it surrounded and 
obscured by an indefinite multitude of unascertainable 
circumstances, rendering the use of the common expe- 
rimental methods almost delusive. We may conceive 
to what extent this is true, if we consider, among other 
things, that whenever nature produces a human mind, 
she produces, in close connexion with it, also a body ; 
that is, a vast complication of physical facts, in no 
two cases perhaps exactly similar, and most of which 
(except the mere structure, which we can examine in 
a sort of coarse way after it has ceased to act) are 
radically out of the reach of our means of exploration. 
If, instead of a human mind, we suppose the subject 
of investigation to be a human society or State, all 
the same difficulties recur in a greatly augmented 
degree.

We have thus already come within sight of a 
conclusion, which the progress of the inquiry will, I 
think, bring before us with the clearest evidence: 
namely, that in the sciences which deal with pheno- 
mena in which artificial experiments are impossible 
(as in the case of astronomy), or in which they have a 
very limited range (as in physiology, mental philo- 
sophy, and the social science,) induction from direct 
experience is practised at a disadvantage generally 
equivalent to impracticabiUty : from which it follows 
that the methods of those sciences, in order to accom- 
pUsh anything worthy of attainment, must be to a 
great extent, if not principally, deductive. This is 
already known to be the case with the first of the 
sciences we have mentioned, astronomy; that it is 
not generally recognised as true of the others, is 
probably one of the reasons why they are still in 
their infancy. But any further notice of this topic 
would at present be premature. 

§ 4. If what is called pure Observation is at so 
great a disadvantage compared with artificial expe- 
rimentation, in one department of the direct explora- 
tion of phenomena, there is another branch in which 
the advantage is all on the side of the former. 

Inductive inquiry having for its object to ascertain 
what causes are connected with what efiects, we may 
begin this search at either end of the road which 
leads from the one point to the other : we may either 
inquire into the efiects of a given cause, or into the 
causes of a given effect. The fact that light blackens 
chloride of silver might have been discovered, either 
by experiments upon Ught, trying what effect it would 
produce on various substances, or by observing that 
portions of the chloride had repeatedly become black,

446 INDUCTION. 

and inquiring into the circumstances. The effect of 
the uraU poison might have become known either by 
administering it to animals, or by examining how it 
happened that the wounds which the Indians of 
Guiana inflict with their arrows prove so uniformly 
mortal. Now it is manifest from the mere statement 
of the examples, without any theoretical discussion, 
that artificial experimentation is appUcable only to 
the former of these modes of investigation. We can 
take a cause, and try what it will produce : but we 
cannot take an eflFect, and try what it will be produced . 
by. We can only watch till we see it produced, or 
are enabled to produce it by accident. 

This would be of httle importance, if it always 
depended upon our choice from which of the two ends 
of the sequence we would undertake our inquiries. 
But we have seldom any option. As we can only travel 
from the known to the unknown, we are obliged to 
commence at whichever end we are best acquainted 
with. If the agent is more famiUar to us than its effects, 
we watch for, or contrive, instances of the agent, under 
such varieties of circumstances as are open to us, and 
observe the result. If, on the contrary, the conditions 
on which a phenomenon depends are obscure, but the 
phenomenon itself familiar, we must commence our 
inquiry from the effect. If we are struck with the 
fact that chloride of silver has been blackened, and 
have no suspicion of the cause, we have no resource 
but to compare instances in which the fact has chanced 
to occur, until by that comparison we discover that in 
all those instances the substance had been exposed to 
the Ught. If we knew nothing of the Indian arrows 
but their fatal effect, accident alone could turn our 
attention to experiments on the uraU : in the regular 
course of investigation, we could only inquire, or try

OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT. 447 

to observe, what had been done to the arrows in par- 
ticular instances. 

Wherever, having nothing to guide us to the 
cause, we are obliged to set out from the eflfect, and 
to apply the rule of varying the circumstances to the 
consequents, not the antecedents, we are necessarily 
destitute of the resource of artificial experimentation. 
We cannot, at our choice, obtain consequents, as we 
can antecedents, under any set of circumstances com- 
patible with their nature. There are no means of 
producing efiects but through their causes, and by the 
supposition the causes of the eflfect in question are not 
known to us. We have therefore no expedient but 
to study it where it oflfers itself spontaneously. If 
nature happens to present us with instances suflS- 
ciently varied in their circumstances, and if we are 
able to discover either among the proximate ante- 
cedents, or among some other order of antecedents, 
something which is always found when the eflfect is 
found, however various the circumstances, and never 
found when it is not; we may discover, by mere 
observation without experiment, a real uniformity in 
nature. 

But although this is certainly the most favourable 
case for sciences of pure observation, as contrasted 
with those in which artificial experiments are possible, 
there is in reality no case which more strikingly illus- 
trates the inherent imperfection of direct induction 
when not founded upon experimentation. Suppose 
that, by a comparison of cases of the eflfect, we have 
found an antecedent which appears to be, and perhaps 
is, invariably connected with it: we have not yet 
proved that antecedent to be the cause, until we have 
reversed the process, and produced the eflfect by 
means of that antecedent. If we can produce the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



448 INDUCTION. 

antecedent artificially, and if, when we do so, the effect 
follows, the induction is complete ; that antecedent is 
the cause of that consequent •• But we then have 
added the evidence of experiment to that of simple 
observation. Until we had done so, we had only 
proved invariable antecedence, but not unconditional 
antecedence, or causation. Until it had been shown 
by the actual production of the antecedent under 
known circumstances, and the occurrence thereupon 
of the consequent, that the antecedent was really the 
condition on which it depended ; the uniformity of 
succession which was proved to exist between them 
might, for aught we knew, be (Uke the succession of 
day and night) no case of causation at all ; both 
antecedent and consequent might be successive stages 
of the effect of an ulterior cause. Observation, in 
short, without experiment (and without any aid from 
deduction) can ascertain uniformities, but cannot prove 
causation. 

In order to see these remarks verified by the 
actual state of the sciences, we have only to think 
of the condition of natural history. In zoology, for 
example, there is an immense number of uniformities 
ascertained, some of coexistence, others of succession, 
to many of which, notwithstanding considerable varia- 
tions of the attendant circumstances, we know not 
any exception: but the antecedents, for the most 
part, are such as we cannot artificially produce ; or, 
if we can, it is only by setting in motion the exact 



? Unless, indeed, the consequent was generated not by the 
antecedent, but by the means we employed to produce the ante- 
cedent. As, however, these means are under our power, there is 80 
far a probability that they are also sufficiently within our knowledge, 
to enable us to judge whether that could be the case or not.

process by which nature produces them; and this 
being to us a mysterious process, of which the main 
circumstances are not only unknown but unobservable, 
the name of experimentation would here be com- 
pletely misapplied. Such are the facts : and what is 
the result ? That on this vast subject, which affords 
so much and such varied scope for observation, we 
have not, properly speaking, ascertained a single 
cause, a single unconditional \miformity. We know 
not, in the case of almost any of the phenomena that 
we find conjoined, which is the condition of the other ; 
which is cause, and which effect, or whether either of 
them is so, or they are not rather all of them conjunct 
effects of causes yet to be discovered, complex results 
of laws hitherto unknown. 

Although some of the foregoing observations may 
be, in technical strictness of arrangement, premature 
in this place, it seemed that a few general remarks 
upon the diflerence between Sciences of mere Obser- 
vation and Sciences of Experimentation, and the 
extreme disadvantage under which directly inductive 
inquiry is necessarily carried on in the former, were 
the best preparation for discussing the methods of 
direct induction ; a preparation rendering superfluous 
much that must otherwise have been introduced, with 
some inconvenience, into the heart of that discussion. 
To the consideration of these Methods we now 
proceed.

OP THE FOUR METHODS OF EXPERIMENTAL 
INQUIRY. 

$ 1. The simplest and most obvious modes of 
singling out from among the circumstances which 
precede or follow a phenomenon, those mth which it 
is really connected by an invariable law, are two in 
number. One is, by comparing together different 
instances in which the phenomenon occurs. The 
other is by comparing instances in which the pheno- 
menon does occur, with instances in other respects 
similar in which it does not. These two methods 
:<^may be respectively denominated, the Method of 
Agreement, and the Method of Difference. 

In illustrating these methods it will be necessary 
to bear in mind the two-fold character of inquiries 
into the laws of phenomena; which may be either 
inquiries into the cause of a given effect, or into the 
effects or properties of a given cause. We shall 
consider the methods in their appUcation to either 
t)rder of investigation, and shall draw our examples 
equally from both. 

We shall denote antecedents by the large letters 
X){ the alphabet, and the consequents corresponding to 
them by the small. Let A, then, be an agent or 
cause, and let the object of our inquiry be to ascertain 
what are the effects of this cause. If we can either 
find^ or produce, the agent A in such varieties of 
circumstances, that the different cases have no cir- 
eumstance in common except A ; then, whatever 
effect we find to be prpduced in all our trials must, it

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS* 451 

^ould seem, be the effect of A. Suppose, for exam« 
pie, that A is tried along with B and C, and that the 
effect is a 6 c; and suppose that A is next tried with 
D and E, but without B and C, and that the effect is 
ade. Then we may reason thus : h and c are not 
effects of A, for they were not produced by it in the 
second experiment ; nor are d and e, for they were 
not produced in the first. Whatever is really the 
effect of A must have been produced in both instances; 
now this condition is fulfilled by no circumstance 
except a. The phenomenon a cannot have been the 
effect of B or C, since it was produced where they 
were not ; nor of D or E, since it was produced 
where they were not. Therefore it is the effect of A. 
For example, let the antecedent A be the contact 
of an alkaline substance and an oil. This combination 
being tried under several varieties of circumstance 
resembling each other in nothing else, the results agree 
in the production of a greasy and detersive or sapo- 
naceous substance : it is therefore concluded that the 
combination of an oil and an alkali causes the produc* 
tion of a soap. It is thus we inquire, by the Method 
of Agreement, into the effect of a given cause. 

In a similar manner we may inquire into the cause 
of a given effect. Let a be the effecjt, Here, as shown 
in the last chapter, we have only the resource of observa* 
tion without experiment; we cannot take a phenomenon 
of which we know not the origin, and try to find its 
mode of production by producing it ; if we succeeded 
in such a random trial it could only be by accident 
But if we can observe a in two different combinations, 
<ibc and ade; and if we know, or can discover, that 
the antecedent circumstjmces in these cases respec- 
tively were ABC and ADE; we may conclude by a 
reasoning similar to that in the preceding example, 

2 Qija by Google 



452 tNDUCTION, 

thdt A is the antecedent connected with the conse- 
quent a by a law of causation. B and O, we may say, 
cannot be causes of a, since on its seeond occurrence 
they were not present ; nor are D and E, for they 
were not present on its first occurrence. A, alone oi 
the fire circumstances, was found among the antece- 
dents of a in both instances^ 

For example, let the efiect a be crystallization. 
We compare instances in which bodies are known to 
assume crystalline structure, but which have no other 
point of agreement ; and we find them to have one, 
and as far as we can observe, only one, antecedent in 
common: the deposition of a solid matter from a 
liquid state, either a state of fusion or of solution. 
We conclude, therefore, that the solidification of a 
substance from a liquid state is an invariable ante- 
cedent of its crystallization. 

In this example we may go fardier, and say, it is 
not only the invariable antecedent but the cause. 
For in this case we are able, after detecting the ante- 
cedent A, to produce it artificially, and by finding 
that a follows it, verify the result of our induction. 
The importance of thus reversing the proof was never 
more strikingly manifested than when, by keeping a 
phial of water charged with siliceous particles undis^ 
turbed for years, a chemist (I believe Dr. WoUaston) 
succeeded in obtaining crystals of quartz ; and in the 
equally interesting experiment in which Sir James 
Hall produced artificial marble, by the cocking of its 
materials from fusion imder immense preasaare : two 
admirable examples of the light which may be thrown 
upon the most secret processes of nature by well-ccm* 
trived interrogation of her. 

But if we cannot artificially produce the phenome- 
non A, the conclusion that it is the cause of a remains

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 453 

subject to very considerable doubt Thougb an inva- 
riable, it may not be the unconditional antecedent of 
a, but may precede it as day precedes night or night 
day. This uncertainty arises from the impossibility 
of assuring ourselves that A is the only immediate 
antecedent common to both the instances. If we 
could be certain of having ascertaiqed all the inva- 
riable antecedents, we might be sure that the uncon* 
ditional invariable antecedent, or cause, must be found 
somewhere among them. Unfortunately it is hardly 
ever possible to ascertain all the antecedents, unless 
the phenomenon is one which we can produce artifi- 
cially. Even then the difiSculty is merely lightened, not 
removed : men knew how to raise water in pumps long 
before they adverted to what was really the operating 
circumstance in the means they employed, namely, the 
pressure of the atmosphere on the open surface of the 
water. It is, however, much easier to analyze com- 
pletely a set of arrangements made by ourselves, than 
the whole complex mass of the agencies which nature 
happens to be exerting at the moment when she pro- 
duces any given phenomenon. We may overlook 
some of the material circumstances in an experiment 
with an electrical machine ; but we shall, at the worst, 
be better acquainted with them than with those of a 
thunder-storoL 

The mode of discovering and proving laws of 
nature, which we have now examined, proceeds upon 
the following ^om : Whatever circumstance can be / 
excluded, without prejudice to the phenomenon, or 
can be absent notwithstanding its presence, is not 
connected with it in the way of causation. The 
casual circumstances being thus eliminated, if only 
one remains, that one is the cause which we are in 
search of: if more than one, they either are, or con-

454 INDUCTION. 

tain among them, the cause : and so, mutatis mutandis, 
of the effect. As this method proceeds by comparing 
different instances to ascertain in what they agree, I 
have termed it the Method of Agreement : and we 
may adopt as its regulating principle the following 
canon: — 

First Canon. 

If two or more instances of the phenomenon under 
investigation have only one circumstance in common^ the 
circumstance in which alone all the instances agree^ is 
the cause Cor effectj of the given phenomenon. 

Quitting for the present the Method of Agree- 
ment, to which we shall almost immediately return, 
we proceed to a still more potent instrument of the 
investigation of nature, the Method of Difference. 

§ 2. In the Method of Agreement, we endeavoured 
to obtain instances which agreed in the given circum- 
stance but differed in every other: in the present 
method we require, on the contrary, two instances 
resembling one another in every other respect, but 
differing in the presence or absence of the phenomenon 
we wish to study. If our object be to discover the 
effects of an agent A, we must procure A in some set 
of ascertained circumstances, as ABC, and having 
noted the effects produced, compare them with the 
effect of the remaining circumstances B C, when A is 
absent. If the effect of A B C is a ft c, and the effect 
of B C, 6 c, it is evident that the effect of A is a. So 
again, if we begin at the other end, and desire to 
investigate the cause of an effect a, we must select an 
instance, as a 6 c, in which the effect occurs, and in 
which the antecedents were ABC, and we must look 
out for another instance in which the remaining

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 455 

circumstances^ he, occur without a. If the antece- 
dents, in that instance, are B C, we know that the 
cause of a must be A : either A alone, or A in conjunc- 
tion with some of the other circumstances present. 

It is scarcely necessary to give examples of a 
logical process to which we owe almost all the induc- 
tive conclusions we draw in daily life. When a man 
is shot through the heart, it is by this method we 
know that it was the gun-shot which killed him : for 
he was in the fulness of life immediately before, all 
circumstances being the same, except the wound. 

The axioms which are taken for granted in this 
method are evidently the following : Whatever ante- 
cedent cannot be excluded without prbventing the 
phenomenon, is the cause, or a condition, of that 
phenomenon ; Whatever consequent can be excludedt 
with no other difference in the antecedents than the 
absence of a particular one, is the effect of that 
one. Instead of comparing different instances of 
a phenomenon, to discover in what they agree, this 
method compares an instance of its occurrence with 
an instance of its non-occurrence, to discover in 
what they differ. The canon which is the regulating 
principle of the Method of Difference may be expressed 
as follows : — 

Second Canon, 

If an instance in which the phenomenon under inves-^ 
tigation occurs^ and an instance in which it does not 
occuTy have every circumstance save one in common^ 
that one occurring only in the former ; the circumstance 
in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or 
cause, or a necessary part of the cai^e, of the pheno^ 
menon.

456 INDUCTION. 

§ 3. The two methods which we have now stated 
have many features of resemblance, but there are also 
many distinctions between them. Both are methods 
of elimination. This term (which is employed in the 
theory of equations to denote the process by which 
one after another of the elements of a question is 
excluded, and the solution made to depend upon the 
relation between the remaining elements only,) is well 
suited to express the operation, analogous to this, 
which has been understood since the time of Bacon 
to be the foundation of experimental inquiry: namely, 
the successive exclusion of the various circumstances 
which are foimd to accompany a phenomenon in a given 
instance, in order to ascertain what are those among 
them which can be absent consistently with the exist- 
ence of the phenomenon. The Method of Agreement 
stands on the ground that whatever can be eliminated, is 
' not connected with the phenomenon by any law. The 
, Method of Difference has for its foundation, that what- 
ever can not be eliminated, is connected with the phe- 
nomenon by a law. 

Of these methods, that of Difference is more 
particularly a method of artificial experiment; while 
that of Agreement is more especially the resource we 
employ where experimentation is impossible. A few 
reflections will prove the fact, and point out the 
reason of it. 

It is inherent in the peculiar character of the 
Method of Difference, that the nature of the combi- 
nations which it requires is much more strictly defined 
than in the Method of Agreement. The two instances 
which are to be comJ>ared with one another must be 
exactly similar, in ail circumstances except the one 
which we are attempting to investigate : they must be 
in the relation of A B C and B C, or of a 6 c and b c.

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 457 

It is true that this similarity of circumstances needs 
not extend to such as are already known to be 
immaterial to the result. And in the case of most 
phenomena we learn at once, from the most ordinary 
experience, that most of the coexistent phenomena of 
the universe may be either present or absent without 
affecting the given phenomenon ; or, if present, are 
present indifferently when the phenomenon does not 
happen, and when it does. Still, even limiting the 
identity which is required between the two instances, 
ABC and BC, to such circumstances as are not 
already known to be indifferent; it is very seldom that 
nature affords two instances, of which we can be 
assured that they stand in this precise relation to 
one another. In the spontaneous operations of 
natui'e there is generally such complication and such 
obscurity, they are mostly either on so overwhelm- 
ingly large or on so inaccessibly minute a scale, we 
are so ignorant of a great part of the £sict8 which 
really take place, and even those of which we are not 
ignorant are so multitudinous, and therefore so seldom 
exactly alike in any two cases, that a spontaneous 
experiment, of the kind required by the Method of 
Difference, is commonly not to be found. When, on 
the contrary, we obtain a phenomenon by an artificial 
experiment, a pair of instances such as the method 
requires is obtained almost as a matter of course, 
provided the process does not last a long time. A 
certain state of surrounding circumstances existed 
before we commenced the experiment : this is B C. 
We then introduce A ; say, for instance, by merely 
bringing an object from another part of the room, 
before there has been time for any change in the 
other elements. It is, in short (as M. Comte observes), 
the very nature of an experiment, to introduce into the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



458 INDUCTION. 

preexisting state of circumstances a change perfectly 
definite. We choose a previous state of things with 
which we are well acquainted, so that no unforeseen 
alteration in that state is likely to pass unobserved ; 
and into this we introduce, as rapidly as possible, the 
phenomenon which we wish to study ; so that we in 
general are entitled to feel complete assurance, that 
the pre-existing state, and the state which we have 
produced, difier in nothing except in the presence or 
absence of that phenomenon. If a bird is taken from 
a cage, and instantly plunged into carbonic acid gas^ 
the experimentalist may be fully assured (at all events 
after one or two repetitions) that no circumstance 
capable of causing suffocation had supervened in the 
interim, except the change from immersion in the 
atmosphere to immersion in carbonic acid gas. There 
is one doubt, indeed, which may remain in some cases 
of this description; the effect may have been pro- 
duced not by the .change, but by the means we 
employed to produce the change. The possibility, 
however, of this last supposition generally admits of 
being conclusively tested by other experiments. It 
thus appears that in the study of the various kinds of 
phenomena which we can, by our voluntary agency, 
modify or control, we can in general satisfy the requi- 
sitions of the Method of Difference; but that by the 
spontaneous operations of nature those requisitions 
are seldom fulfilled. 

The reverse of this is the case with the Method 
of Agreement. We do not here require instances of 
so special and determinate a kind. Any instances 
whatever, in which nature presents us witii a pheno- 
menon, may be examined for the purposes of this 
method ; and if all such instances agree in any- 
thing, a conclusion of considerable value is already 



Digitized

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 459 

attained. We can seldom, indeed, be sure that this 
one point of agreement is the only one ; but our igno- 
rance does not, as in the Method of Difference, vitiate 
the conclusion ; the certainty of the result, as far as 
it goes, is not affected. We have ascertained one 
invariable antecedent or consequent, however many 
other invariable antecedents or consequents may stiH 
remain unascertained. If ABC, ADE, AFG, are 
all equally followed by a, then a is an invariable con- 
sequent of A. Jf ab c, ad e, af g, all number A 
among their antecedents, then A is connected as an 
antecedent, by some invariable law, with a. But to 
determine whether this invariable antecedent is a 
cause, or this invariable consequent an effect, we must 
be able, in addition, to produce the one by means of 
the other; or, at least, to obtain that which alone 
constitutes our assurance of having produced any- 
thing, namely, an instance in which the effect, cf, has 
come into existence, with no other change in the 
pre-existing circumstances than the addition of A. 
And this, if we can do it, is an application of the 
Method of Difference, not of the Method of Agree- 
ment. 

It thus appears to be by the Method of Difference u. 
alone that we can ever, in the way of direct expe- 
rience, arrive with certainty at causes. The Method of 
Agreement leads only to laws of phenomena, as Mr. 
Whewell calls them, but which (since laws of causation 
are also laws of phenomena) I prefer to designate as 
uniformities in which the question of causation must for 
the present remain undecided. The Method of Agree- 
ment is chiefly to be resorted to, as a means of suggest- 
ing applications of the Method of Difference (as in the 
last example the comparison of A B C, A D E, A F G, 
suggested that A was the antecedent on which to try 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



460 INDUCTION. 

the experiment whether it could produce a); or as 
an inferior resource, in case the Method of Dtflference 
is impracticable ; which, as we before showed, gene- 
rally arises from the impossibility of artificially pro- 
ducing the phenomena. And hence it is that the 
Method of Agreement, although applicable in principle 
to either case, is more emphatically the method of 
investigation on those subjects where artificial experi-. 
mentation is impossible ; because on those it is, gene- 
rally, our only resource of a directly inductive nature; 
while, in the ph^iomena which we can produce at 
pleasure, the Method of Difference generally affords a 
more efficacious process, which will ascertain causes as 
well as mere laws. 

$ 4. Our next remark shall be, that there are 
many cases in which, although our power of producing 
the phenomenon is complete, the Method of Difference 
either cannot be made available at all, or not without 
a previous employment of the Method of Agreement. 
This occurs when the agency by which we can 
produce the phenomenon is not that of one single 
antecedent, but a combination of antecedents, which 
we have no power of separating from each other and 
exhibiting apart. For instance, suppose the subject 
of inquiry to be the cause of the double refraction of 
light. We can produce this phenomenon at pleasure, 
by employing any one of the many substances which 
are known to refract light in that peculiar manner. 
But if, taking one of those substances, as Iceland spar 
for example, we wish to determine on which of the 
properties of Iceland spar this remarkable pheno- 
menon depends, we can make no use, for that pur- 
pose, of the Method of Difference ; for we cannot &id 
another substance precisely resembling Icdand spar

TtlE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 461 

except in some one property. The only mode, there- 
fore, of prosecuting this mqniry is that afforded by the 
Method of Agreement ; by which, in fact, through a 
comparison of all the known substances which had 
the property of doubly refracting light, it was ascer* 
tained that they agreed in the single circumstance of 
being crystaUine substances ; and although the con- 
verse does not hold, although all crystalline substances 
have not the property of double refraction, it was 
concluded, with reason, that there is a real connection 
between these two properties ; that either crystaUine 
structure, or the cause which gives rise to that struc- 
ture, is one of the conditions of double refraction. 

Out of this employment of the Method of Agree- 
ment arises a peculiar modification of that method, 
which is sometimes of great avail in the investigation 
of nature. In cases similar to the above, in which it 
is not possible to obtain the precise pair of instances 
which our second canon requires — instances agreeing 
in every antecedent except A, or in every consequent 
except a ; we may yet be able, by a double employ- 
ment of the Method of Agreement, to discover in what 
the instances which contain A or a, differ from those 
which do not. 

If we compare various instances in which a occurs, 
and find that they all have in common the circum- 
stance A, and (as far as can be observed) no other 
circumstance, the Method of Agreement, so far, bears 
testimony to a connexion between A and a. In order 
to convert this proof of connexion into proof of 
causation by the direct Method of Difference, we 
ought to be able in some one of these instances, as 
for example ABC, to leave out A, and observe 
whether by doing so, a is prevented. Now supposing 
(what is often the case) that we are not able to try

this decisive experiment ; yet, provided we can by 
any means discover what would be its result if we 
vokld try it, the advantage will be the same. Sup- 
pose, then, that as we previously examined a variety 
of instances in which a occurred, and found them to 
agree in containing A, so we now observe a variety 
of instances in which a does not occur, and find 
them agree in not containing A; which establishes, by 
the Method of Agreement, the same connexion between 
the absence of A and the absence of a, which was 
before established between their presence. As, then, it 
had been shown that whenever A is present a is present, 
so it being now shown that when A is taken away a is 
removed along with it, we have by the one proposition 
A B C, a fc c, by the other B C, & c, the positive and 
negative instances which the Method of Difference re- 
quires. Thus, if it be true that all animals which have a 
well-developed respiratory system, and therefore aerate 
the blood perfectly, agree in being warm-blooded, while 
those whose respiratory system is imperfect do not 
maintain a temperature much exceeding that of the 
surrounding medium, we may argue from this two- 
fold experience, that the change which takes place 
in the blood by respiration is the cause of animal 
heat. 

This method may be called the Indirect Method of 
Difference, or the Joint Method of Agreement and 
Difference ; and consists in a double employment of 
the Method of Agreement, each proof being indepen- 
dent of the other, and corroborating it. But it is not 
equivalent to a proof by the direct Method of Differ- 
ence. For the requisitions of the Method of Difference 
are not satisfied, unless we can be quite sure either 
that the instances aflSrmative of a agree in no antece- 
dent whatever but A, or that the instances negative of 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 463 

a agree m nothing but the negation of A. Now if it 
were possible, which it never is, to have this assurance, 
we should not need the joint method ; for either of 
the two sets of instances separately would then be 
sufficient to prove causation. This indirect method, 
therefore, can only be viewed as a great extension and 
improvement of the Method of Agreement, but not as 
participating in the more cogent nature of the Method 
of Difference. The following may be stated as its 
canon : — 

Third Canon. 

If two or more instances in which the phenomenon 
occurs have only one circumstance in common, while 
two or more instances in^which it does not occur have 
nothing in common save the absence of that circum^ 
stance ; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of 
instances differ ^ is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part 
of the cause, of the phenomenon. 

We shall presently show that the Joint Method 
of Agreement and Difference constitutes, in another 
respect not yet adverted to, an improvement upon the 
common Method of Agreement, namely, in being 
unaffected by a characteristic imperfection of that 
method, the nature of which still remains to be 
pointed out. But as we cannot enter into this expo- 
sition without introducing a new element of com- 
plexity into this long and intricate discussion, I shall 
postpone it to the next chapter, and shall at once 
proceed to the statement of two other methods, which 
will complete the enumeration of the* means which 
mankind possess for exploring the laws of nature by 
specific observation and experience.

§ 5. The first of these has been aptly denominated 
the Method of Residues. Its principle is very simple. 
Subducting from any given phenomenon all the por- 
tions which, by virtue of preceding inductions, can be 
assigned to known causes, the remainder will be the 
effect of the antecedents which had been overlooked, 
or of which the effect was as yet an unknown quantity. 

Suppose, as before, that we have the antecedents 
ABC, followed by the consequents ab c, and that 
by previous inductions, (founded, we will suppose, 
upon the Method of Difference,) we have ascertained 
the causes of some of these effects, or the effects of 
some of these causes; and are by this means apprised 
that the effect of A is a, and that the effect of B is b. 
Subtracting the sum of these effects from the total 
phenomenon, there remains c, which now, without 
any fresh experiment, we may know to be the effect 
of C. This Method of Residues is in truth a peculiar 
modification of the Method of Difference. If the 
instance A B C, a 6 c, could have been compared with 
a single instance A B, a &, we should have proved C 
to be the cause of c, by the common process of the 
Method of Difference. In the present case, however, 
instead of a single instance A B, we have had to study 
separately the causes A and B^ and to infer from the 
effects which they produce separately, what effect 
they must produce in the case ABC where they act 
together. Of the two instances, therefore, which the 
Method of Difference requires, — the one positive, the 
other negative, — the negative one, or that in which 
the given phenomenon is absent, is not the direct 
result of observation and axperimesit, but has been 
arrived at by deduction. As one of the forms of the 
Method of Difference, the Method of Residues partakes 
of its rigorous certainty, provided the previous induc-

THE FOUR BXPERIMBNTAL METHODS. 465 

tions, those which gave the effects of A and B, were 
obtained by the same infallible method, and provided 
we are certain that C is the only antecedent to which 
the residual phenomenon c can be referred ; the only 
agent of which we had not already calculated and 
subducted the effect. But as we can never be quite 
certain of this, the evidence derived from the Method 
of Residues is not complete, unless we can obtain C 
artificially and try it separately, or unless its agency, 
when once suggested, can be accounted for, and 
proved deductively, from known laws. 

Even with these reservations, the Method of 
Residues is one of the most important among our 
instruments of discovery. Of all the methods of 
investigating laws of nature, this is the most fertile in 
unexpected results ; often informing us of sequence 
in which neither the cause nor the effect were suffi- 
ciently conspicuous to attract of themselves the atten- 
tion of observers. The agent C may be an obscure 
circumstance, not likely to have been perceived unless 
sought for, nor likely to have been sought for until 
attention had been awakened by the insufficiency of 
the obvious causes to account for the whole of the 
effect. And c may be so disguised by its intermixture 
.with a and 6, that it would scarcely have presented 
itself spontaneously as a subject of separate study. 
Of these uses of the method, we shall presently cite 
some remarkable examples. The canon of the 
Method of Residues is as follows : — 

Fourth Canon. 
Subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known 
by previous inductions to be the eff^ect of certain antece- 
dents^ and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of 
the remmning antecedents.

§ 6. There remains a class of laws which it is 
impracticable to ascertain by any of the three methods 
which I have attempted to characterize; namely, 
the laws of those Permanent Causes, or indestructible 
natural agents, which it is impossible either to exclude 
or to isolate; which we can neither hinder from being 
present, nor contrive that they shall be present alone. 
It would appear at first sight that we could by no 
means separate the effects of these agents from the 
effects of those other phenomena with which they 
cannot be prevented from co-existing. In respect, 
indeed, to most of the permanent causes, no such 
difficulty exists; since, though we cannot eliminate 
them as coexisting facts, we can eliminate them as 
influencing agents, by simply trjring our experiment 
in a local situation beyond the limits of their influ- 
ence. The pendulum, for example, has its oscillations 
disturbed by the vicinity of a mountain : we remove 
the pendulum to a sufficient distance frt)m the moun- 
tain, and the disturbance ceases : from these data we 
can determine by the Method of Difference, the 
amount of effect really due to the mountain; and 
beyond a certain distance everything goes on precisely 
as it would do if the mountain exercised no influence 
whatever, which, accordingly, we, with sufficient 
reason, conclude to be the fact. 

The difficulty, therefore, in appljong the methods 
already treated of to determine the effects of Per- 
manent Causes, is confined to the cases in which it is 
impossible for us to get out of the local limits of their 
influence. The pendulum can be removed from the 
influence of the mountain, but it cannot be removed 
from the influence of the earth: we cannot take away 
the earth from the pendulum, nor the pendulum from 
the earth, to ascertain whether it would continue to

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 467 

vibrate if the action which the earth exerts upon it 
were withdrawn. On what evidence, then, do we 
ascribe its vibrations to the earth's influence ? Not 
on any sanctioned by the Method of Diflference ; for 
one of the two instances, the negative instance, is 
wanting. Nor by the Method of Agreement; for 
although all pendulums agree in this, that during 
their oscillations the earth is always present, why may 
we not as well ascribe the phenomenon to the sun, 
which is equally a coexistent fact in all the experi- 
ments ? It is evident that to establish even so simple 
a fact of causation as this, there was required some 
method over and above those which we have yet 
examined. 

As another example, let us take the phenomenon 
Heat. Independently of all hypothesis as to the real 
nature of the agency so called, this fact is certain, 
that we are unable to exhaust any body of the whole 
of its heat. It is equally certain that no one ever 
perceived heat not emanating from a body. Being 
unable, then, to separate Body and Heat, we cannot 
effect such a variation of circumstances as the fore- 
going three methods require ; we cannot ascertain, by 
those methods, what portion of the phenomena 
exhibited by any body are due to the heat contained 
in it. If we could observe a body with its heat, and 
the same body entirely divested of heat, the Method 
of Difference would show the effect due to the heat, 
apart from that due to tiie body. If we could observe 
beat under circumstances agreeing in nothing but heat, 
and therefore not characterized also by the presence 
of a body, we could ascertain the effects of heat, from 
an instance of heat with a body and an instance of 
heat without a body, by the Method of Agreement ; 
or, if we pleased, we could determine by the Method 

^oBizI by Google 



468 INDUCTION. 

of Difference what effect was due to the body, when 
the remainder which wa8 due to the heat would be 
given by the Method of Residues. But we can do 
none of these things ; and without them the appli- 
cation of any of the three methods to the solution of 
this problem would be illusory. It would be idle, for 
instance, to attempt to ascertain the effect of heat by 
subtracting from the phenomena exhibited by a body, 
all that is due to its other properties ; for as we have 
never been able to observe any bodies without a 
portion of heat in them, the effects due to that heat 
may form a part of the very results, which we affect to 
subtract in order that the effect of heat may be shown 
by the residue. 

If, therefore, there were no other methods of 
eicperimental investigation than these three, we should 
be for ever unable to determine the effects due to heat 
as a cause. But we have still a resource. Though 
we cannot exclude an antecedent altogether, we may 
be able to produce, or nature may produce for us, 
some modi6cation in it. By a modification is here 
meant, a change in it, not amounting to its total 
removal. If some modification in the antecedent A 
is always followed by a change in the consequent a, 
the other consequents 6 and c remaining the same; 
or, mce versd, if every change in a is found to have 
been preceded by some modification in A, none being 
observable in any of the other antecedents ; we may 
safely conclude that a is, wholly or in part, an effect 
traceable to A, or at least in some way connected with 
it through causation. For example, in the case of 
heat, though we cannot expel it ^together from any 
body, we can modify it in quantity, we can increase 
or diminish it ; and doing so, we find by the various 
methods of experimentation or observation already

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 469 

treated of, that such increase or dimmution of heat is 
followed by expansion or contraction of the body. 
In this manner we arrive at the conclusion, otherwise 
unattainable by us, that one of the effects of heat is 
to enlarge the dimensions of bodies ; or what is the 
same thing in other words, to widen the distances 
between their particles. 

A change in a thing, not amounting to its total 
removal, that is, a change which leaves it still the 
same thing it was, must be a change either in its 
quantity, or in some of its relations to other things, of 
which relations the principal is its position in space. 
In the previous example, the modification which was 
produced in the antecedent was an alteration in its 
quantity. Let us now suppose the question to be, 
what influence the moon exerts on the surface of 
the earth. We cannot try an experiment in the 
absence of the moon, so as to observe what terrestrial 
phenomena her annihilation would put an end to; 
but when we find that all the variations in the position 
of the moon are followed by corresponding variations 
in the time and place of high water, the place being 
always either on the side of the earth which is 
nearest to, or on that which is most remote from, the 
moon, we have ample evidence that the moon is, 
wholly or partially, the cause which determines the 
tides. It very commonly happens, as it does in this 
instance, that the variations of an effect are corre- 
spondent, or analogous, to those of its cause ; as the 
moon moves further towards the east, tiie high 
water point does the same : but this is not an indis- 
pensable condition; as may be seen in the same 
example, for along with that high water point, there 
is at the same instant another high water point 
diametrically opposite to it, and which, therefore.

470 INDUCTION. 

of necessity, moves towards the west as the moon 
followed by the nearer of the tide waves advances 
towards the east: and yet both these motions are 
equally effects of the moon's motion. 

That the oscillations of the pendulum are caused 
by the earth, is proved by similar evidence. Those 
oscillations take place between equidistant points on 
the two sides of a line, which, being perpendicular to 
the earth, varies with every variation in the earth's 
position, either in space or relatively to the object. 
Speaking accurately, we only know by the method 
now characterized, that all terrestrial bodies tend to 
the earth, and not to some unknown fixed point lying 
in the same direction. In every twenty-four hours, 
by the earth's rotation, the line drawn from the body 
at right angles to the earth coincides successively 
with all the radii of a circle, and in the course of six 
months the place of that circle varies by nearly two 
hundred millions of miles ; yet in all these changes of 
the earth's position, the line in which bodies tend to 
fall continues to be directed towards it : which proves 
that terrestrial gravity is directed to the earth, and 
not, as was once fancied by some, to a fixed point of 
space. 

The method by which these results were obtained, 
may be termed the Method of Concomitant Variations: 
it is regulated by the following canon : — 

Fifth Canon. 

Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner when- 
ever another phenomenon varies in some particular 
manner y is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon^ 
or is connected with it through some fact of causation. 

The last clause is subjoined, because it by no 
means follows when two phenomena accompany each

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 471 

Other in their variations, that the one is cause and the 
other effect. The same thing may, and indeed must 
happen, supposing them to be two different effects of 
a common cause : and by this method alone it would 
never be possible to ascertain which of the two sup- 
positions is the true one. The only way to solve the 
doubt would be that which we have so often adverted 
to, viz., by endeavouring to ascertain whether we can 
produce the one set of variations by means of the 
other. In the case of heat, for example, by increasing 
the temperature of a body we increase its bulk, but 
by increasing its bulk we do not increase its tem- 
perature; on the contrary, (as in the rarefaction of air 
under the receiver of an air-pump,) we generally 
diminish it: therefore heat is not an effect, but a 
cause, of increase of bulk. If we cannot ourselves 
produce the variations, we must endeavour, though 
it is an attempt which is seldom successful, to find 
them produced by nature in some case in which 
the pre-existing circumstances are perfectly known 
to us. 

It is scarcely necessary to say, that in order to 
ascertain the uniform concomitance of variations in 
the effect with variations in the cause, the same 
precautions must be used as in any other case of the 
determination of an invariable sequence. We must 
endeavovu* to retain all the other antecedents un- 
changed, while that particular one is subjected to the 
requisite series of variations ; or in other words, that 
we may be warranted in inferring causation from 
concomitance of variations, the concomitance itself 
must be proved by the Method of Difference. 

It might at first appear that the Method of Con- 
comitant Variations assumes a new axiom, or law of 
causation in general, namely, that every modification 



Digitized 



by Google 



472 INDUCTION. 

of the cause is followed by a change in the effect. And 
it does usually happen that when a phenomenon A 
causes a phenomenon a, any variation in the quantity 
or in the various relations of A, is uniformly followed 
by a variation in the quantity or relations of a. To 
take a familiar instance, that of gravitation. The 
sun causes a certain tendency to motion in the earth ; 
here we have cause and effect ; but that tendency is 
towards the sun, and therefore varies in direction as 
the sun varies in the relation of position ; and more- 
over the tendency varies in intensity, in a certain 
numerical ratio to the sun's distance from the earth, 
that is, according to another relation of the sun. 
Thus we see that there is not only an invariable con- 
nexion between the sun and the earth's gravitation, 
but that two of the relations of the sun, its position 
with respect to the earth and its distance from the 
earth, are invariably connected as antecedents with 
the quantity and direction of the earth's gravitation. 
The cause of the earth's gravitating at all, is simply 
the sun ; but the cause of her gravitating with a given 
intensity and in a given direction, is the existence of 
the sun in a given direction and at a given distance. 
It is not strange that a modified cause, which is in 
truth a different cause, should produce a different 
effect. But as the cause is only different in its quan- 
tity, or in some of its relations, it usually happens 
that the effect also is only changed in its quantity or 
its relations. 

Although it is for the most part true that a modi- 
fication of the cause is followed by a modification of 
the effect, the Method of Concomitant Variations does 
not, however, pre-suppose this as an axiom. It only 
requires the converse proposition ; that anything upon 
whose modifications, modifications of an effect are

THB FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 473 

invariably consequent, must be the cause (or con- 
nected with the cause) of that effect ; a proposition, 
the truth of which is evident ; for if the thing itself 
had no influence on the effect, neither could the modi- 
cations of the thing have any influence. If the stars 
have no power over the fortunes of men, it is implied 
in the very terms, that the conjunctions or oppositions 
of different stars can have no such power. 

Although the most striking applications of the 
Method of Concomitant Variations take place in the 
cases in which the Method of Difference, strictly so 
called, is impossible, its use is not confined to those 
cases ; it may often usefully follow after the Method 
of Difference, to give additional precision to a solution 
which that has found. When by the Method of Differ- 
ence it has first been ascertained that a certain object 
produces a certain effect, the Method of Concomitant 
Variations may be usefully called in to determine 
according to what law the quantity or the different 
relations of the effect follow those of the cause. 

% 7. The case in which this method admits of the 
most extensive employment, is that in which the 
variations of the cause are variations of quantity. Of 
such variations we may in general aflirm with safety, 
that they will be attended not only with variations, 
but with similar variations, of the effect : the proposi- 
tion, that more of the cause is followed by more of 
the effect, being a corollary from the principle of the 
Composition of Causes, which, as we have seen, is the 
general rule of causation; cases of the opposite 
description, in which causes change their properties 
on being conjoined with one another, being, on the 
contrary, special and exceptional. Suppose, then, 
that when A changes in quantity, a also changes in

474 INDUCTION. 

quantity, and in such a manner that we can trace the 
numerical relation which the changes of the one bear 
to such changes of the other as take place within our 
limits of observation. We may then, with certain 
precautions, safely conclude that ^the same numerical 
relation will hold beyond those limits. If, for instance, 
we find that when A is double, a is double ; that when 
A is treble or quadruple, a is treble or quadruple ; we 
may conclude that if A were a half or a third, a would 
be a half or a third, and finally, that if A were anni- 
hilated, a would be annihilated, and that a is wholly 
the effect of A, or whoUy the effect of the same cause 
with A. And so with any other numerical relation 
according to which A and a would vanish simulta- 
neously ; as for instance if a were proportional to the 
square of A. If, on the other hand, a is not wholly 
the effect of A, but yet varies when A varies, it is 
probably (to use a mathematical phrase) a function 
not of A alone but of A and something else: its 
changes will be such as would occur if part of it 
remained constant, or varied on some other principle, 
and the remainder varied in some numerical relation 
to the variations of A. In that case, when A dimi- 
nishes, a will seem to approach not towards zero, but 
towards some other limit: and when the series of 
variations is such as to indicate what that limit is, if 
constant, or the law of its variation if variable, the 
limit will exactly measure how much of a is the effect 
of some other and independent cause, and the re- 
mainder will be the effect of A (or of the cause of A). 

These conclusions, however, must not be drawn 
without certain precautions. In the first place, the 
possibility of drawing them at all, manifestly supposes 
that we are acquainted not only with the variations, 
but with the absolute quantities, both of A and a. If

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 475 

we do not know the total quantities, we cannot, of 
course, determine the real numerical relation according 
to which those quantities vary. It is therefore an 
error to conclude, as some have concluded, that be- 
cause increase of heat expands bodies, that is, increases 
the distance between their particles, therefore that 
distance is wholly the eflfect of heat, and that if we 
could entirely exhaust the body of its heat, the par- 
ticles would be in complete contact. This can never 
be more than a guess, and of the most hazardous sort, 
not a legitimate induction : for since we neither know 
how much heat there is in any body, nor what is the 
real distance between any two of its particles, we 
cannot judge whether the contraction of the distance 
does or does not follow the diminution of the quantity 
of heat according to such a numerical relation that 
the two quantities would vanish simultaneously. 

In contrast with this, let us consider a case in 
which the absolute quantities are known; the case 
contemplated in the first law of motion ; viz., that all 
bodies in motion continue to move in a straight line 
with uniform velocity until acted upon by some new 
force. This assertion is in open opposition to first 
appearances ; all terrestrial objects, when in motion, 
gradually abate their velocity and at last stop ; which 
accordingly the ancients, with their inductio per enu- 
merationem simplicem^ imagined to be the law. Every 
moving body, however, encounters various obstacles, 
as friction, the resistance of the atmosphere, &c., 
which we know by daily experience to be causes 
capable of destroying motion. It was suggested that 
the whole of the retardation might be owing to these 
causes. How was this inquired into ? If the obstacles 
could have been entirely removed, the case would 
have been amenable to the Method of Difference. They 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



476 INDUCTION. 

could not be removed, they could only be diminished, 
and the case, therefore, admitted only of the Method 
of Concomitant Variations. This accordingly being 
employed, it was found that every diminution of the 
obstacles diminished the retardation of the motion : 
and inasmuch as in this case (unlike the case of heat) 
the total quantities both of the antecedent and of the 
consequent were known; it was practicable to esti- 
mate, with an approach to accuracy, bpth the amount 
of the retardation and the amount o^ the retarding 
causes, or resistances, and to judge how near they 
both were to being exhausted ; and it appeared that 
the effect dwindled as rapidly, and at each step was 
as far on the road towards annihilation, as the cause 
was. The simple oscillation of a weight suspended 
from a fixed point, and moved a little out of the 
perpendicular, which in ordinary circumstances lasts 
but a few minutes, was prolonged in Borda's experi- 
ments to more than thirty hours, by diminishing as 
much as possible the friction at the point of suspen- 
sion, and by making the body oscillate in a space 
exhausted as nearly as possible of its air. There 
could therefore be no hesitation in assigning the whole 
of the retardation of motion to the influence of the 
obstacles : and since, after subducting this retardation 
from the total phenomenon, the remainder was an 
uniform velocity, the result was the proposition 
known as the first law of motion. 

There is also another characteristic uncertainty 
affecting the inference that the law of variation 
which the quantities observe within our Umits of 
observation, will hold beyond those limits. There is 
of course, in the first instance, the possibility that 
beyond the limits, and in circumstances therefore of 
which we have no direct experience, some counter-

THE FOUR EXPERIMENTAL METHODS. 477 

acting cause might develop itself; either a new agent, 
or a new property of the agents concerned, which lies 
dormant in the circumstances we are able to observe. 
This is an element of uncertainty which enters largely 
into all our predictions of effects ; but it is not pecu- 
liarly applicable to the Method of Concomitant Varia- 
tions. The uncertainty, however, of which I am 
about to speak, is characteristic of that method; 
especially m the cases in which the extreme limits of 
our observation are very narrow, in comparison with 
the possible variations in the quantities of the pheno- 
mena. Any one who has the slightest acquaintance 
with mathematics, is aware that very different laws of 
variation may produce numerical results which differ 
but slightly from one another within narrow limits; 
and it is often only when the absolute amounts of 
variation are considerable, that the difference between 
the results given by one law and by another, becomes 
appreciable. When, therefore, such variations in the 
quantity of the antecedents as we have the means of 
observing, are but small in comparison with the total 
quantities, there is much danger lest we should mis- 
take the numerical law, and be led quite to miscal- 
culate the variations which would take place beyond 
the limits ; a miscalculation which would vitiate any 
conclusion respecting the dependence of the effect 
upon the cause, which could be foimded upon those 
variations. Examples are not wanting of such mis- 
takes. *' The formulae," says Sir John Herschel*, 
'* which have been empirically deduced for the elasti- 
city of steam (tOl very recently), and those for the 
resistance of fluids, and other similar subjects," when 
relied on beyond the limits of the observations from

which they were deduced, ''have almost invariably 
failed to support the theoretical structures which have 
been erected on them." 

Under this uncertainty, the conclusion we may 
draw from the concomitant variations of a and A, to 
the existence of an invariable and exclusive connexion 
between them, or to the permanency of the same 
numerical relation between their variations when the 
quantities are much greater or smaller than those 
which we have had the means of observing, cannot 
be considered to rest upon a complete induction. All 
that in such a case can be regarded as proved on the 
subject of causation, is that there is some connexion 
between the two phenomena ; that A, or something 
which can influence A, must be one of the causes 
which collectively determine a. We may, however, 
feel assured that the relation which we have observed 
to exist between the variations of A and a, will hold 
true in all cases which fall between the same extreme 
limits; that is, wherever the utmost increase or 
diminution in which the result has been found by 
observation to coincide with the law, is not exceeded. 

The four methods which it has now been attempted 
to describe, are the only possible modes of experimen- 
tal inquiry, of direct induction a posteriori^ as distin- 
guished from deduction : at least I know not, nor am 
able to conceive, any others. And even of these, the 
Method of Residues, as we have seen, is not indepen- 
dent of deduction; though, as it requires specific 
experience in addition, it may, without impropriety, 
be included among methods of direct observation and 
experiment. 

These, then, with such assistance as can be 
obtained from Deduction, compose the available 
resources of the human mind for ascertaining the

laws of the succession of phenomena. Before pro- 
ceeding to point out certain circumstances, hy which 
the employment of these methods is subjected to an 
immense increase of complication and of difficulty, it 
is expedient to illustrate the use of the methods, by 
suitable examples, drawn from actual physical inves- 
tigations. These, accordingly, will form the subject 
of the succeeding chapter.

MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR 
METHODS. 

§ 1. I SHALL select, as my first example, an 
interesting speculation of one of the most eminent 
theoretical chemists of the present or any age, Dr. 
Liebig. The object in view, is to ascertain the imme- 
diate cause of the death produced by metallic poisons. 

Arsenious acid, and the salts of lead, bismuth, 
copper, and mercury, if introduced into the animal 
organism, except in the smallest doses, destroy life. 
These facts have long been known, as insulated 
truths of the lowest order of generalization ; but it 
was reserved for Ldebig, by an apt employment of the 
first two of our methods of experimental inquiry, to 
connect these truths together by a higher induction, 
pointing out what property, common to all these 
deleterious substances, is the really operating cause of 
their fatal effect. 

When solutions of these substances are placed in 
sufficiently close contact with many animal products, 
albumen, milk, muscular fibre, and animal mem- 
branes, the acid or salt leaves the water in which it 
was dissolved, and enters into combination with the 
animal substance ; which substance, after being thus 
acted upon, is found to have lost its tendency to spon- 
taneous decomposition, or putrefaction. 

Observation also shows, in cases where death has 
been produced by these poisons, that the parts of the 
body with which the poisonous substances have been 
brought into contact, do not afterwards putrefy.

EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR METHODS. 481 

And, finally, when the poison has been supplied 
in too small a quantity to destroy life, eschars are 
produced, that is, certain superficial portions of the 
tissues are destroyed, which are afterwards thrown oflT 
by the reparative process taking place in the healthy 
parts. 

I'hese three sets of instances admit of being 
treated according to the Method of Agreement. In 
all of them the metallic compounds are brought into 
contact with the substances which compose the 
human or animal body; and the instances do not 
seem to agree in any other circumstance. The 
remaining antecedents are as different, and eveq 
opposite, as they could possibly be made; for in some 
the animal substances exposed to the action of the 
poisons are in a state of life, in others only in a state 
of organization, in others not even in that. And 
what is the result which follows in all the cases? 
The conversion of the animal substance (by combi- 
nation with the poison) into a chemical compound, 
held together by so powerful a force as to resist the 
subsequent action of the ordinary causes of decompo- 
sition. Now, organic life (the necessary condition of 
sensitive life) consisting in a continual state of decom- 
position and recomposition of the different organs and 
tissues; whatever incapacitates them for this decom- 
position destroys life. And thus the proximate cause 
of the death produced by this description of poisons, 
is ascertained, as far as the Method of Agreement can 
ascertain it. 

Let us now bring our conclusion to the test of the Me- 
thod of Difference. Setting out from the cases already 
mentioned, in which the antecedent is, the presence of 
substances forming with the tissues a compound in- 
capable of putrefaction (and a fortiori incapable of the 

VOL. I. B^itiid by Google 



482 INDUCTION. 

chemical actions wbich constitute life), and the con- 
sequent is death, either of the whole organism, or of 
some portion of it ; let us compare with these cases 
other cases, as much resembling them as possible, but 
in which that effect is not produced. And, first of 
all, '' many insoluble basic salts of arsenious acid are 
known not to bq poisonous. The substance called 
alkargen, discovered by Bunsen, which contains a 
very large quantity of arsenic, and approaches very 
closely in composition to the organic arsenious com- 
pounds found in the body, has not the slightest 
injurious action upon the organism." Now when 
these substances are brought into contact with the 
tissues in any way, thej- do not combine with them ; 
they do not arrest their progress to decomposition. 
As far, therefore, as these instances go, it appears 
that when the efiect is absent, it is by reason of the 
absence of that antecedent which we had ah*eady good 
ground for considering as the proximate cause. 

But the rigorous conditions of the Method of 
Difference are not yet satisfied; for we cannot be 
sure that these unpoisonous bodies agree with the 
poisonous substances in every property, except the 
particular one, of entering into a difficultly decom- 
posable compound with the animal tissues. To renda: 
the method strictly applicable, we need an instance, 
not of a different substance, but of one of the very 
same substances, under circumstances which would 
prevent it from forming, with the tissues, the sort of 
compound in question ; and then, if death does not 
follow, our case is made out. Now such instances 
are afforded by the antidotes to these poisons. For 
example, in case of poisoning by arsenious acid, if 
hydrated peroxide of iron is administered, the destruc- 
tive agency is instantly checked. Now this peroxide

is known to combine with the acid, and form a com^ 
pound, which, being insoluble, cannot act at all on 
animal tissues. So, again, sugar is a well-known 
antidote to poisoning by salts of copper ; and sugar 
reduces those salts either into metallic copper, or into 
the red suboxide, neither of which enters into com- 
bination with animal matter. The disease called 
painter's colic, so common in manufactories of white 
lead, is unknown where the workmen are accustomed 
to take, as a preservative, sulphuric-acid-lemonade (a 
solution of sugar rendered acid by sulphuric add). 
Now diluted sulphuric acid has the property of decom*^ 
posing all compounds of lead with organic matter, and 
(of course) of preventing them from being formed. 

There is another class of instances, of the nature 
required by the Method of Diflference, which seem at 
first sight to conflict with the theory. Soluble salts 
of silver, such for instance as the nitrate^ have the 
same stifiening antiseptic eflfect on decomposing 
animal substances as corrosive sublimate and the 
most deadly metallic poisons; and when applied to 
the external parts of the body, the nitrate is a power- 
ful caustic, depriving those parts of all active vitaUty, 
and causing them to be thrown off by the neighbour^ 
ing living structures, in the form of an eschar. The 
nitrate and the other salts of silver ought, then, it 
would seem, if the theory be correct, to be poisonous ; 
yet they may be administered internally with perfect 
impunity. From this apparent exception arises the 
strongest confirmation which this theory of Liebig 
has yet received. Nitrate of silver, in spite of its 
chemical properties, does not poison when introduced 
into the stomach; but in the stomach, as in all 
animal liquids, there is common salt; and in the 
stomach there is also free muriatic add. These sub-

stances operate as natural antidotes, combining with 
the nitrate, and if its quantity is not too great, 
immediately converting it into chloride of silver; a 
substance very slightly soluble, and therefore in- 
capable of combining with the tissues, although to the 
extent of its solubility it has a medicinal influence, 
through an entirely different class of organic actions. 

$ 2. The preceding instances have afforded an 
induction of a high order of conclusiveness, illustrative 
of the two simplest of our four methods; although not 
rising to the maximum of certainty which the Method 
of Difference, in its most perfect exemplification, is 
capable of affording. For (let us not forget) the 
positive instance and the negative one which the 
rigour of that method requires, ought to differ only in 
the presence or absence of one single circumstance. 
Now, in the preceding argument, they differ in the 
presence or absence not of a single circumstance, but 
of a single substances and as every substance has 
innumerable properties, there is no knowing what 
number of real differences are involved in what is 
nominally and apparently only one difference. It is 
conceivable that the antidote, the peroxide of iron for 
example, may counteract the poison through some 
other of its properties than that of forming an insoluble 
compound with it ; and if so, the theory would fall 
to the ground, so far as it is supported by that 
instance. This source of uncertainty, which is a 
serious hindrance to all extensive generalizations in 
chemistry, is however reduced in the present case to 
almost the lowest degree possible, when we find that 
not only one substance, but many substances, possess 
the capacity of acting as antidotes to metallic poisons, 
and that all these agree in the property of forming

EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR METHODS. 485 

insoluble compounds with the poisons^ while they 
cannot be ascertained to agree in any other property 
whatsoever. We have thus, in favour of the theory, 
all the evidence which can be obtained by what we 
termed the Indirect Method of Difference, or the Joint 
Method of Agreement and Difference ; the evidence of 
which, though it never can amount to that of the 
Method of Difference properly so called, may approach 
indefinitely near to it. 

No similar defect of completeness in proof will 
be found in the following original investigation, for 
which I am indebted to Mr. Alexander Bain, at present 
Lecturer on Moral Philosophy in Marischal College, 
Aberdeen; one of the men from whom science and 
philosophy have most to hope, and who has permitted 
me to lay his extensive knowledge of every depart- 
ment of physical inquiry freely under contribution, 
for the purpose of exemplifying and illustrating the 
doctrines of this work. 

$ 3. Let the object be to ascertain the law of what 
is termed induced electricity; to find under what 
conditions any electrified body, whether positively or 
negatively electrified, gives rise to a contrary electric 
state in some other body adjacent to it. 

The most familiar exemplification of the pheno- 
menon to be investigated, is the following. Around 
the prime conductors of an electrical machine, the 
atmosphere to some distance, or any conducting 
surface suspended in that atmosphere, is found to be 
in an electric condition opposite to that of the prime 
conductor itself. Near and around the positive prime 
conductor there is negative electricity, and near and 
around the negative prime conductor there is positive 
electricity. When pith balls are brought near to

either of the conductors, they become electiified with 
the opposite electricity to it; either receiving a share 
from the ah*eady electrified atmosphere by conduction, 
or acted upon by the direct inductive influence of the 
conductor itself: they are then attracted by the con- 
ductor to which they are in opposition; or, if with- 
drawn in their electrified state, they will be attracted 
by any other oppositely charged body. In like 
manner the hand, if brought near enough to the 
conductor, receives or gives an electric discharge; 
now we have no evidence thnt a charged conductor 
can be suddenly discharged unless by the approach of 
a body oppositely electrified. In the case, therefore, 
of the electrical machine, it appears that the accu- 
mulation of electricity in an insulated conductor is 
always accompanied by the excitement of the contrary 
electricity in the surroundimg atmosphere, and in 
every conductor placed near the fonner conductor. 
It does not seem possible, in this case, to produce one 
electricity by itself. 

Let us now examine all the other instances which 
we can obtain, resembling this instance in the given 
consequent, namely, the evolution of an opposite 
electricity in the neighbourhood of an electrified body. 
As one remarkable instance we have the Leyden jar ; 
and after the splendid experiments of Faraday in 
conjiplete and final establishment of the substantial 
identity of magnetism and electricity, we may cite 
the magnet, both the natural and the electro-magnet, 
in neither of which is it possible to produce one kind 
of electricity by itself, or to charge one pole without 
charging an opposite pole with the contrary electricity 
at the same time. We cannot have a magnet with 
one pole: if we break a natural loadstone into a 
thousand pieces, each piece will have its two oppo-

EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR METHODS. 487 

sitely electrified poles complete within itself. In the 
voltaic circuit, again, we cannot have one current 
without its opposite. In the ordinary electric machine, 
the glass cylinder or plate, and the rubber, acquire 
opposite electricities. 

From all these instances^ treated by the Method 
of Agreement, a general law appears to result. The 
instances embrace all the known modes in which a 
body can become charged with electricity ; and in all 
of them there is found, as a concomitant or con-r 
sequent, the excitement of the opposite electric state 
in some other body or bodies. It seems to follow 
that the two facts are invariably connected, and that 
the excitement of electricity in any body has for one 
of its necessary conditions the possibility of a simuU 
taneous excitement of the opposite electricity in some 
neighbouring body. 

As the two contrary electricities can only be pro- 
duced together, so they can only cease together. 
This may be shown by an application of the Method 
of Difference to the example of the Leyden jar. It 
needs scarcely be here remarked that in the Leyden 
jar, electricity can be accumulated and retained in con- 
siderable quantity, by the contrivance of having two 
conducting surfaces of equal extent, and parallel to each 
other through the whole of that extent, with a non-con- 
ducting substance such as glass between them. When 
one side of the jar is charged positively, the other is 
charged negatively, and it was by virtue of this fact 
that the Leyden jar served just now as an instance in 
our employment of the Method of Agreement. Now 
it is impossible to discharge one of the coatings unless 
the other can be discharged at the same time. A 
conductor held to the positive side cannot convey

488 INDUCTION. 

away any electricity unless an equal quantity be 
allowed to pass from the negative side : if one coating 
be perfectly insulated, the charge is safe. The dissi- 
pation of one must proceed pari passu with the other. 

The law thus strongly indicated admits of cor- 
roboration by the Method of Concomitant Varia- 
tions. The Leyden jar is capable of receiving a 
much higher charge than can ordinarily be given to 
the conductor of an electrical machine. Now in the 
case of the Leyden jar, the metallic surface which 
receives the induced electricity is a conductor exactly 
similar to that which receives the primary charge, and 
is therefore as susceptible of receiving and retaining 
the one electricity, as the opposite surface of receiving 
and retaining the other: but in the machine, the 
neighbouring body which is to be oppositely electrified 
is the surrounding atmosphere, or any body casually 
brought near to the conductor^ and as these are 
generally much inferior in their capacity of becoming 
electrified, to the conductor itself, their limited power 
imposes a corresponding Umit to the capacity of the 
conductor for being charged. As the capacit]r of tbe 
neighbouring body for supporting the opposition 
increases, a higher charge becomes possible: and to 
this appears to be owing the great superiority of the 
Leyden jar. 

A further and most decisive confirmation by the 
Method of Difierence, is to be found in one of Fara- 
day's experiments in the course of his researches on 
the subject of induced electricity. 

Since common or machine electricity, and voltaic 
electricity, may be considered for the present purpose 
to be identical, Faraday wished to know whether, as 
the prime conductor developes opposite electricity

EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR METHODS. 489 

upon a conductor in its vicinity, so a voltaic current 
running along a wire would induce an opposite current 
upon another wire laid parallel to it at a short dis- 
tance. Now this case is similar to the cases previously 
examined, in every circumstance except the one to 
which we have ascribed the effect. We found in the 
former instances that whenever electricity of one kind 
was excited in one body, electricity of the opposite 
kind must be excited in a neighbouring body ; and 
the interpretation of this, in the language of cause 
and effect, is, that all causes which can excite the one 
kind of electricity, have the property of simultaneously 
exciting an equal amount of the other. But in Fara- 
day's experiment this indispensable opposition exists 
within the wire itself. From the nature of a voltaic 
charge, the two opposite currents necessary to the 
existence of each other are both accommodated in one 
wire; and there is no need of another wire placed 
beside it to contain one of them, in the same way as 
the Leyden jar must have a positive and a negative 
surface. The exciting cause can and does produce all 
the effect which its laws require, independently of any 
electric excitement of a neighbouring body. Now 
the result of Faraday's experiment with the second 
wire, was that no opposite current was produced. 
There was an instantaneous effect at the closing and 
breaking of the voltaic circuit ; electric inductions 
appeared when the two wires were moved to and from 
one another ; but these are phenomena of a different 
class. There was no induced electricity in the sense in 
which this is predicated of the Leyden jar ; there was 
no sustained current running up the one wire while 
an opposite current ran down the neighbouring wire ; 
and this alone would have been a true parallel case to 
the other.

It thus appears by the combined evidence of the Me- 
thod of Agreement, the Method of Concomitant Vari- 
ations, and the most rigorous form of the Method of 
Difference, that neither of the two kinds of electricity 
can be excited without an equal excitement of the 
other and opposite kind : that both are effects of the 
same cause, that the possibility of the one is a con- 
dition of the possibility of the other, and the quan- 
tity of the one an impassable limit to the quantity 
of the other. A scientific result of considerable 
interest in itself, and illustrating those three me- 
thods in a manner both characteristic and easily 
intelligible. 

$ 4. Our third example shall be extracted from 
Sir John Herschel's Discourse on the Study of Natural 
Philosophy^ a work replete with admirably-selected 
exempUfications of inductive processes from almost 
every department of physical science, and in which 
alone^ of all books which I have met with, the four 
methods of induction are recognised, although not 
characterised and defined nor their correlation shown, 
so distinctly as has appeared to me desirable. The 
present example is justly described by Sir John 
Herschel as '* one of the most beautiful specimens'^ 
which can be cited " of inductive experimental inquiry 
lying within a moderate compass ;" the theory of dew, 
first promulgated by the late Dr. Wells, and now 
universally adopted by scientific men. 

The passages in inverted commas are extracted 
verbatim from Sir John Herschel*, but to those who

the entire passage in the original, and fuUy possess

thenlselves of the purport of the speculation as a 
whole, before applying themselves, with me, to the 
logical analysis of the different steps of the argu^ 
ment* 

'* Suppose dew were the phenomenon proposed, 
whose cause we would know. In the first jdace'* we 
must determine precisely what we mean by dew; 
what the fact really is, whose cause we desire to 
investigate. ** We must separate dew from rain, and 
the moisture of fogs, and limit the application of the 
term to what is really meant, which is, the sponta- 
neous appearance of moisture on substances exposed 
in the open air when no rain or visible wet is 
falling.'* This answers to a preUminary operation 
which will be characterised in the ensuing book, 
treating of operations subsidiary to induction*. The 
state of the question being fixed, we come to the 
solution. 

" Now, here we have analogous phenomena in the 
moisture which bedews a cold metal or stone when we 
breathe upon it; that which appears on a glass of 
water fresh from the well in hot weather ; that which 
appears on the inside of windows when sudden rain or 
hail chills the external air ; that which runs down our 
walls when, after a long frost, a warm moist thaw 
comes on.*' Comparing these cases, we find that they 
all contain the phenomenon which was proposed as 
the subject of investigation. Now * * all these instances 
agree in one point, the coldness of the object dewed, 
in comparison with the air in contact with it." But 
there still remains the most important case of all, 
that of nocturnal dew : does the same circumstance

492 INDUCTION. 

exist in this case? ''Is it a fact that the object 
dewed is colder than the air? Certainly not, one 
would at first be inclined to say; for what is to make 
it so ? But .... the experiment is easy : we have only 
to lay a thermometer in contact with the dewed sub- 
stance, and hang one at a Uttle distance above it, out 
of reach of its influence. The experiment has been 
therefore made; the question has been asked, and 
the answer has been invariably in the affirmative. 
Whenever an object contracts dew, it is colder than 
the air.'' 

Here then is a complete application of the 
Method of Agreement, establishing the fact of an inva- 
riable connexion between the deposition of dew on a 
surface, and the coldness of that surface compared 
with the external air. But which of these is cause 
and which effect ? or are they both effects of some- 
thing else ? On this subject the Method of Agreement 
can afford us no Ught : we must call in a more potent 
method. 

**That dews are accompanied with a chill is a 
common remark; but vulgar prejudice would make 
the cold the effect rather than the cause. We must 
therefore collect more facts, or, which comes to the 
same thing, vary the circumstances; since every 
instance in which the circumstances differ is a fresh 
fact ; and especially, we must note the contrary or 
negative cases, i. e., where no dew is produced :" for 
we are aware that a comparison between instances of 
dew and instances of no dew, is the condition neces- 
sary to bring the Method of Difference into play. 

*' Now, first, no dew is produced on the surface of 
polished metals, but it is very copiously on glass, both 
exposed with their faces upwards, and in some cases

EXAMPLES OF THE FOUR METHODS. 493 

the under side of a horizontal plate of glass is also 
dewed*." Here is an instance in which the eflFect is 
produced, and another instance in which it is not 
produced ; but we cannot yet pronounce, as the canon 
of the Method of DiflPerence requires, that the latter 
instance agrees with the former in all its circum-^ 
stances except one ; for the differences between glass 
and polished metals are manifold, and the only thing 
we can as yet be sure of is, that the cause of dew will 
be found among the circumstances by which the 
former substance is distinguished from the latter. 
But if we could be sure that glass, and the various 
other substances on which dew is deposited, have only 
one quality in common, and that polished metals and 
the other substances on which dew is not deposited 
have also nothing in common but the one circum- 
stance, of not having the one quality which the others 
have; the requisitions of the Method of Difference 
would be completely satisfied, and we should recog- 
nise, in that quality of the substances, the cause of 
dew. This, accordingly, is the path of inquiry which 
is next to be pursued. 

'' In the cases of polished metal and polished glass, 
the contrast shows evidently that the substance has 
much to do with the phenomenon ; therefore let the 
substance alone be diversified as much as possible, by * 
exposing polished surfaces of various kinds. This 



* This last circumstance (adds Sir John Herschel) '^ excludes 
the fall of moisture from the sky in an invisible form, which would 
naturally suggest itself as a cause." I have omitted this passage in 
the text, as not pertinent to the purpose in hand, the argument 
which it contains being deductive and d priori. The fall of 
moisture is rejected as a cause, because from its laws previously 
known, we infer that it could not have produced the particular 
phenomenon last mentioned.

done, a scale of intensity becomes obvious. Those 
polished substances are found to be most strongly 
dewed which conduct heat worst ; while those which 
conduct well, resist dew most eflfectually." The 
complication increases ; here is the Method of Conco- 
mitant Variations called to our assistance; and no 
other method was practicable upon this occasion ; for 
the quality of conducting heat could not be excladedU 
since all substances conduct heat in some (tegree. 
The conclusion obtained is, that cmteris paribus the 
deposition of dew is in some proportion to the power 
which the body possesses of resisting the passage of 
heat ; and that this, therefore, (or something con- 
nected with this,) must be at least one of the causes 
which assist in producing the deposition of dew upcm 
the surface. 

"But if we expose rough surfaces instead of 
polished, we sometimes find this law interfered with. 
Thus, roughened iron, especially if painted over or 
blackened, becomes dewed sooner than varnished 
paper: the kind of surface^ therefore, has a great 
influence. Expose, then, the same material in very 
diversified states as to surface,'' (that is, employ the 
Method of Difference to ascertain concomitance of 
variations,) ** and another scale of intensity becomes 
at once apparent; those surfojces which part tvith their 
heat most readily by radiation, are found to contract 
dew most copiously." Here, therefore, are the requi- 
sites for a second employment of the Method of Con- 
comitant Variations ; which in this case also is the 
only method available, since all substances radiate 
heat in some degree or othfer. The conclusion 
obtained by this new application of the method is, 
that c€Bteris paribus the deposition of dew is also in 
some proportion to the power of radiating heat ; and

that the quality of doing this abundantly (or some 
cause on which that quality depends) is another of 
the causes which promote the deposition of dew upon 
the substance. 

'' Again, the influence ascertained to exist of sub- 
stance and surface leads us to consider that of texture: 
and here, again, we are pres^ited on trial with 
remarkable difierences, and with a third scale of 
intensity, pointing out substances of a close firm 
texture, such as stones, metals, &c., as unfavourable, 
but those of a loose one, as cloth, wool, velvet, eider- 
down, cotton, &c., as eminently favourable to the 
contraction of dew.'' The Method of Concomitant 
Variations is here, for the third time, had recourse to ; 
and, as before, from necessity, since the texture of no 
substance is absolutely firm or absolutely loose. 
Looseness of texture, therefore, or something which 
is the cause of that quality, is another circumstance 
which promotes the deposition of dew; but this third 
cause resolves itself into the first, viz., the quality of 
resisting the passage of heat : for substances of loose 
texture *' are precisely those which are best adapted for 
clothing, or for impeding the free passage of heat from 
the skin into the air, so as to allow their outer sur- 
faces to be very cold while they remain warm within;" 
and this last is, therefore, an induction (from fresh 
instances) simply corroborative of a former induction. 

It thus appears that the instances in which much 
dew is deposited, which are very various, agree in 
this, and, so far as we are able to observe, in this only, 
that they either radiate heat rapidly or conduct it 
slowly : qualities between which there is no other cir- 
cumstance of agreement, than that by virtue of either, 
the body tends to lose heat from the surface more 
rapidly than it can be restored from within. The

instances, on the contrary^ in which no dew, or but a 
small quantity of it, is formed, and which are also 
extremely various, agree (so far as we can observe) in 
nothing except in not having this same property. We 
seem, therefore, to have detected the sole difference 
between the substances on which dew is produced, 
and those on which it is not produced. And thus 
have been realized the requisitions of what we have 
termed the Indirect Method of Difference, or the Joint 
Method of Agreement and Difference. The example 
afforded of this indirect method, and of the manner in 
which the data are prepared for it by the Methods of 
Agreement and of Concomitant Variations, is the most 
important of all the illustrations of induction afforded 
by this most interesting speculation. 

We might now consider the question, upon what 
the deposition of dew depends, to be completely 
solved, if we could be quite sure that the substances 
on which dew is produced differ from those on which 
it is not, in nothing but in the property of losing heat 
from the surface faster than the loss can be repaired 
from within. And, although we never can have that 
complete certainty, this is not of so much importance 
as might at first be supposed; for we have, at all 
events, ascertained that even if there be any other 
quaUty hitherto unobserved which is present in all 
the substances which contract dew, and absent in 
those which do not, this other property must be one 
which, in all that great number of substances, is 
present or absent exactly where the property of being 
a better radiator than conductor is present or absent ; 
an extent of coincidence which affords the strongest 
presumption of a community of cause, and a conse- 
quent invariable coexistence between the two proper- 
ties ; so that the property of being a better radiator

than conductor, if not itself the cause, almost certainly 
always accompanies the cause, and for purposes of 
prediction, no error will be committed by treating it 
as if it were really such. 

Reverting now to an earlier stage of the inquiry, 
let us remember that we had ascertained that, in every 
instance where dew is formed, there is actual coldness 
of the surface below the temperature of the surrounding 
air ; but we were not sure whether this coldness was 
the cause of dew, or its effect. This doubt we are now 
able to resolve. We have found that, in every such 
instance, the substance must be one which, by its own 
properties or laws^ would, if exposed in the night, 
become colder than the surrounding air. But if the 
dew were the cawe of the coldness, that effect would 
be produced in other substances, and not solely in 
those whose own laws suffice to produce it whether 
there were dew or no. That supposition, therefore, 
is repelled. But there were only three suppositions 
possible; the dew is the cause of the coldness; both 
are caused by some third circumstance ; or the cold- 
ness is the cause of the dew. The first is refuted. The 
second is inapplicable : the cause of the coldness is a 
known cause; a radiation from the surface greater 
than can be supplied by conduction : now this, by its 
known laws, can produce no direct effect except cold- 
ness. There remains only the third supposition, that 
the coldness is the cause of the dew : which, therefore, 
may be considered as completely made out. 

This law of causation, already so amply established, 
admits, however, of most efficient additional corrobo- 
ration in no less than three ways. First, by deduc- 
tion from the known laws of aqueous vapour when 
diffused through air or any other gas ; and although 
we have not yet come to the Deductive Method, we

will not omit what is necessary to render this specula- 
tion complete. It is known by direct experiment that 
only a limited quantity of water can remain suspended in 
the state of vapour at each degree of temperature, and 
that this maximum grows less and less as the tempe- 
rature diminishes. From this it follows, deductively, 
that if there is already as much vapour suspended as 
the air will contain at its existing temperature, any 
lowering of that temperature will cause a portion of 
the vapour to be condensed, and become water. But, 
again, we know deductively, from the laws of heat, 
that the contact of the air with a body colder than 
itself, will necessarily lo.Wer the temperature of the 
stratum of air immediately applied to its surface ; and 
will therefore cause it to part with a portion of its water, 
which accordingly will, by the ordinary laws of gravita- 
tion or cohesion, attach itself to the surftk^ of the body, 
thereby constituting dew. This deductive proof, it 
will have been seen, has the advantage of proving at 
once, causation as well as coexistence ; and it has the 
additional advantage that it also accounts for the 
exceptions to the occurrence of the phenomenon, the 
cases in which, although the body is colder than the 
air, yet no dew is deposited; by showing that this 
will necessarily be the case when the air is so under- 
supplied with aqueous vapour, comparatively to its 
temperature, that even when somewhat cooled by the 
contact of the colder body, it can still continue to 
hold in suspension all the vapour which was pre- 
viously suspended in it : thus in a very dry summer 
there are no dews, in a very dry winter no hoar fixjst, 
Here, therefore, is an additional condition of the pro- 
duction of dew, which the methods we previously 
made use of failed to detect^ and which might have 
remained still undetected, if recourse had not been

had to the plan of deducing the effect from the ascer- 
tained properties of the agents known to be present. 

The second corroboration of the theory is by direct 
experiment, according to the canon of the Method of 
Difference. We can, by cooling the surface of any 
body, find in all cases some temperature (more or less 
inferior to that of the surrounding air, according to 
its hygrometric condition,) at which dew will begin 
to be deposited. Here, too, therefore, the causation 
is directly proved. We can, it is true, accomplish 
this only on a small scale ; but we have ample reason 
to conclude that the same operation, if conducted in 
Nature^s great laboratory, would equally produce the 
effect. 

And, finally, even on that great scale we are able 
to verify the result. The case is one of those (rare 
cases, as we have shown them to be,) in which Nature 
works the experiment for us in the same manner in 
which we ourselves perform it ; introducing into the 
previous state of things a l^ingle and perfectly definite 
new circumstance, and manifesting the effect so rapidly 
that there is not time for any other material change 
in the pre-existing circumstances. Let us quote again 
Sir John Herschel: — " It is observed that dew is never 
copiously deposited in situations much screened from 
the open sky, and not at all in a cloudy night ; but 
if the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes ^ and leave 
a clear opening ^ a deposition of dew presently begins^ 
and goes on increasing. . . . Dew formed in clear 
intervals will often even evaporate again when the 
sky becomes thickly overcast." The proof, therefore, 
is complete, that the presence or absence of an unin- 
terrupted communication with the sky causes the 
deposition or non-deposition of dew. Now, since a 
clear sky is nothing but the absence of clouds, and 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



500 INDUCTION. 

it is a known property of clouds, as of all other bodies 
between which and any given object nothing inter- 
venes but an elastic fluid, that they tend to raise or 
keep up the superficial temperature of the object by 
radiating heat to it, we see at once that the disappear- 
ance of clouds will cause the surface to cool ; so that 
Nature, in this case, produces a change in the ante- 
cedent by definite and known means, and the conse- 
quent foUows accordingly: a naturcd experiment which 
satisfies the requisitions of the Method of Difference*. 
The accumulated proof of which the Theory of 
Dew has been found susceptible, is a striking example 
of the fulness of assurance which the inductive 
evidence of laws of causation may attain, in cas^ in 
which the invariable sequence is by no means obvious 



* I must, however, remark, that this example, which seems to 
militate against the assertion we made of the comparative inappli- 
cability of the Method of Difference to cases of pure observation, is 
really one of those exceptions which, according to a proverbiid 
expression, prove the general rule. For, be it observed, in this 
case in whicih Nature, in her experiment, seems to have imitated 
^e type of the experiments made by man, she has only succeeded 
in producing the likeness of man's most imperfect experiments, 
namely those in which, though he succeeds in producing the pheno- 
menon, he docs so by employing complex means, which he is unable 
perfectly to analyze, and can form, therefore, no sufficient judgment 
what portion of the effects may be due, not to the supposed cause, 
but to some unknown agency of the means by which that cause was 
produced. In the natural experiment which we are speaking o^ 
the means used was the clearing off a canopy of clouds; and we 
certainly do not know sufficiently in what this process consists, or 
upon what it depends, to be certain d priori that it might not 
operate upon the deposition of dew independently of any thermo- 
metric effect at the earth's surfSetce. Even, therefore, in a case so 
favourable as this to Nature's experimental talents, her experiment 
is of little value except in corroboration of a conclusion abready 
attained through other means.

to a superficial view. It is unnecessary to subjoin 
Sir John Herschel's summary of the result, as it does 
not contain all the proofs which I have given^ and 
our more detailed analysis of each step of the process 
renders such a recapitulation unnecessary. 

$ 5. This admirable example will have conveyed 
to any one by whom it has been duly followed, so 
clear a conception of the use and practical manage- 
ment of three of the four methods of experimental 
inquiry, as to supersede the necessity of any further 
exemplification of them. The remaining method, 
that of Residues, not having found any place either 
in this or in the two preceding investigations, I shall 
extract from Sir John Herschel some examples of 
that method, with the remarks by which they are 
introduced. 

'' It is by this process, in fact, that science, in its 
present advanced state, is chiefly promoted. Most of 
the phenomena which Nature presents are very com- 
plicated; and when the effects of all known causes 
are estimated with exactness, and subducted, the 
residual facts are constantly appearing in the form of 
phenomena altogether new, and leading to the most 
important conclusions. 

" For example : the return of the comet predicted 
by Professor Encke, a great many times in succession, 
and the general good agreement of its calculated with 
its observed place during any one of its periods of 
visibility, would lead us to say that its gravitation 
towards the sun and planets is the sole and sufficient 
cause of all the phenomena of its orbitual motion : 
but when the effect of this cause is strictly calculated 
and subducted from the observed motion, there is

found to remain behind a remdual phenomewm, which 
would never have been otherwise ascertained to exist, 
which is a small anticipation of the time of its reqv 
pearance, or a diminution of its periodic time, whidi 
cannot be accounted for by gravity, and whose cause 
is therefore to be inquired into. Such an anticipation 
would be caused by the resistance of a medium dis- 
seminated through the celestial r^ons ; and as th^% 
are other good reasons for believing this to be a vera 
causa/^ (an actually existing antecedent,) '' it has 
therefore been ascribed to such a resistance. 

'* M. Arago, having suspended a magnetic needle 
by a silk thread, and set it in vibration, observed, that 
it came much sooner to a state of rest when suspended 
over a plate of copper, than when no such plate was 
beneath it. Now, in both cases there were two vera 
causa'^ (antecedents known to exist) '* why it should 
come at length to rest, viz., the resistance (^ the air, 
which opposes, and at length destroys, all motions 
performed in it ; and the want of perfect mobility 
in the silk thread. But the effect of these causes 
being exactly known by the observation made in the 
absence of tiie copper, and being thus allowed for and 
subducted, a residual] phenomenon appeared, in the 
fact that a retarding influence was exerted by the 
copper itself; and this fact, once ascertained, speedily 
led to the knowledge of an entirely new and unex- 
pected class of relations." This example belongs, 
however, not to the Method of Residues but to the 
Method of Difference, the law being ascertained by a 
direct comparison of the results of two experiments, 
which differed in nothing but the presence or absence 
of the plate of copper. To have made it exemplify 
the Method of Residues, the effect of the resistance

of the air and that of the rigidity of the silk should 
have been calculated d priori^ from the laws obtained 
by separate and foregone experiments. 

^' Unexpected and peculiarly striking confirmations 
of induc^ve laws frequently occur in the form of 
residual phenomena, in the course of investigations of 
a widely different nature from those which gave rise 
to the inductions themselves. A very elegant example 
may be cited in the unexpected confirmation of the 
law of the developement of heat in elastic fluids by 
compression, which is afforded by the phenomena of 
sound. The inquiry into the cause of sound had led 
to conclusions respecting its mode of propagation, 
from which its velocity in the air could be precisely 
calculated. The calculations were performed; but, 
when compared with fact, though the agreement was 
quite sufficient to show the general correctness of the 
cause and mode of propagation assigned, yet the whole 
velocity could not be shown to arise from this theory. 
There was still a residual velocity to be accounted for, 
which placed dynamical philosophers for a long time 
in a great dilemma. At length Laplace struck on the 
happy idea, that this might arise from the heat deve- 
loped in the act of that condensation which necessarily 
takes place at every vibration by which sound is 
conveyed. The matter was subjected to exact calcu* 
lation, and the result was at once the complete expla- 
nation of the residual phenomenon, and a striking 
confirmation of the general law of the developement 
of heat by compression, under circumstances beyond 
artificial imitation.'' 

" Many of the new elements of chemistry have 
been detected in the investigation of residual pheno- 
mena. Thus Arfwedson discovered lithia by perceiv- 
ing an excess of weight in the sulphate produced from

a small portion of what he considered as magnesia 
present in a mineral he had analyzed. It is on this 
principle, too, that the small concentrated residues of 
great operations in the arts are almost sure to be the 
lurking places of new chemical ingredients : witness 
iodine, brome, selenium, and the new metals accom- 
panying platina in the experiments of Wollaston and 
Tennant. It was a happy thought of Glauber to 
examine what everybody else threw away*." 

The disturbing effects mutually produced by the 
earth and planets upon each other's motions were 
first brought to light as residual phenomena, by the 
difference which appeared between the observed places 
of those bodies, and the places calculated on a con- 
sideration solely of their gravitation towards the sun. 
It was this which determined philosophers to consider 
the law of gravitation as obtaining between all bodies 
whatever, and therefore between all particles of matter; 
their first tendency having been to regard it as a force 
acting only between each planet or satellite and the 
central body to whose system it belonged. Again, the 
catastrophists, in geology, be their opinion right or 
wrong, support it upon the plea, that after the efilect 
of all causes now in operation has been allowed for, 
there remains in the existing constitution of the earth 
a large residue of fietcts, proving the existence at 
former periods either of other forces, or of the same 
forces in a much greater degree of intensity. To add 
one more example : if it be possible to establish, what 
is generally rather assumed than proved, that there is 
in one human individual, one sex, or one race of 
mankind over another, an inherent and inexplicable 
superiority in mental faculties, this must be proved

by subtracting from the differences of intellect which 
we in fact see, all that can be traced by known laws 
either to the ascertained differences of physical 
organization, or to the differences which have existed 
in the outward circumstances in which the subjects 
of the comparison have hitherto been placed. What 
these causes might fail to account for, would constitute 
a residual phenomenon, which and which alone would 
be evidence of an ulterior original distinction, and the 
measure of its amount. But the strongest assertors 
of such supposed differences have hitherto been very 
negligent of providing themselves with these neces- 
sary logical conditions of the establishment of their 
doctrine. 

The spirit of the Method of Residues being, it is 
hoped, sufficiently intelligible from these examples, 
and the other three methods having been so aptly 
exemplified in the inductive processes which produced 
the Theory of Dew, we may here close our exposition 
of the four methods, considered as employed in the 
investigation of the simpler and more elementary 
order of the combinations of phenomena.

OF PLURALITY OF CAUSES; AND OF THE 
INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 

§ ]. In the preceding exposition of the four 
methods of observation and experiment, by which we 
contrive to distinguish among a mass of coexistent 
phenomena tlie particular eflfect due to a given cause, 
or the particular cause which gave birth to a given 
eflFect ; it has been necessary to suppose, in the first 
instance, for the sake of simplification, that this ana- 
lytical operation is encumbered by no other difficulties 
than what are essentially inherent in its nature ; and 
to represent to ourselves, therefore, every efiect, on 
the one hand as connected exclusively with a single 
cause, and on the other hand as incapable of being 
mixed and confounded with any other coexistent 
effect. We have regarded a ft c c2 e, the aggregate of 
the phenomena existing at any moment, as consisting 
of dissimilar facts, a, ft, c, d, and e, for each of which 
one, and only one, cause needs be sought; the diffi- 
culty being only that of singUng out this one cause 
from the multitude of antecedent circumstances, A, B, 
C, D, and E. 

If such were the fact, it would be comparatively 
an easy task to investigate the laws of nature. But 
the supposition does not hold, in either of its parts. 
In the first place, it is not true that the same pheno* 
menon is always produced by the same cause: the 
effect a may sometimes arise from A, sometimes horn 
B. And, secondly, the effects of different causes are 
often not dissimilar, but homogeneous, and marked

PLURALITY OP CAUSES. 507 

out by no assignable boundaries from one another : A 
and B may produce not a and by but diflferent portions 
of an effect a. The obscurity and difficulty of the 
investigation of the laws of phenomena is singularly 
increased by the necessity of adverting to these two 
circumstances ; Intermixture of Effects, and Plurality 
of Causes. To the latter, being the simpler of the 
two considerations, we shall first direct our attention. 
It is not true, then, that one effect must be 
connected with only one cause, or assemblage of con- 
ditions ; that each phenomenon can be produced only 
in one way. There are often several independent 
modes in which the same phenomenon could have 
originated. One fact may be the consequent in 
several invariable sequences; it may follow, with 
equal uniformity, any one of several antecedents, or 
collections of antecedents. Many causes may pro- 
duce motion : many causes may produce some kinds 
of sensation : many causes may produce death. A 
given effect may really be produced by a certain 
cause, and yet be perfectly capable of being produced 
without it. 

§ 2. One of the principal consequences of this 
fact of Plurality of Causes is, to render the first of our 
inductive methods, that of Agreement, uncertain. To 
illustrate that method, we supposed two instances, 
ABC followed by a 6 c, and A D E followed by a d ^. 
From these instances it might be concluded that A 
is an invariable antecedent of a; and even that it 
is the unconditional invariable antecedent or cause, if 
we could be sure that there is no other antecedent 
common to the two cases. That this difficulty may 
not stand in the way, let us suppose the two cases 
positively ascertained to have no antecedent in com-

508 INDUCTION. 

mon except A. The moment, however, that we let 
in the possibility of a plurality of causes, the conclu- 
sion fails. For it involves a tacit supposition, that a 
must have been produced in both instances by the 
same cause. If there can possibly have been two 
causes, those two may, for example, be C and E : the 
one may have been the cause of a in the former of the 
instances, the other in the latter, A having no influ- 
ence in either case. 

Suppose, for example, that two great artists, or great 
philosophers, that two extremely selfish, or extremely 
generous characters, were compared together as to the 
circumstances of their education and history, and the 
two cases were found to agree only in one circumstance: 
would it follow that this one circumstance was the 
cause of the quality which characterized both those 
individuals ? Not at all ; for the causes at work to 
produce any given type of character are innumerable; 
and the two persons might equally have agreed in 
their character^ although there had been no manner 
of resemblance in their previous history. 

This, therefore, is a characteristic imperfection of 
the Method of Agreement; from which imperfection 
the Method of Difference is free. For if we have two 
instances, ABC and B C, of which B C gives b c, 
and A being added converts it into ab c,it is certain 
that in this instance at least A was either the cause 
of a, or an indispensable portion of its cause, ev^i 
though the cause which produces it in other instances 
may be altogether different. Plurality of Causes, 
therefore, not only does not diminish the reliance due 
to the Method of Difference, but does not even render 
a greater number of observations or experiments 
necessary: two instances, the one positive and the 
other negative, are still sufficient for the most com-

PLURALITY OF CAUSES. 509 

plete and rigorous induction. Not so, however, with 
the Method of Agreement. The conclusions which 
that yields, when the number of instances compared is 
small, are of no real value, except as, in the character 
of suggestions, they may lead either to experiments 
bringing them to the test of the Method of Difference, 
or to reasonings which may explain and verify them 
deductively. 

It is only when the instances, being indefinitely 
multiplied and varied, continue to suggest the same 
result, that this result acquires any high degree of 
independent value. If there are but two instances^ 
ABC and A D E, although these instances have no 
antecedent in common except A, yet as the effect 
may possibly have been produced in the two cases by 
different causes, the result is at most only a sUght 
probability in favour of A; there may be causation, 
but it is almost equally probable that there was only, 
as the expression is, a Coincidence. But the oftener 
we repeat the observation, varying the circumstances, 
the more we advance towards a solution of this doubt. 
For if we try A F G, A H K, &c., all entirely unlike 
one another except in containing the circumstance 
A, and if we find the effect a entering into the result 
in all these cases, we must suppose one of two 
things, either that it is caused by A, or that it has as 
many different causes as there are instances. With 
each addition, therefore, to the number of instances, 
the presumption is strengthened in favour of A. The 
inquirer, of course, will not neglect, if an opportunity 
present itself, to exclude A from some one of these 
combinations, from A H K for instance, and by 
trying H K separately, appeal to the Method of 
Difference in aid of the Method of Agreement. By 
the former method alone can it be ascertained that A

by Google 



510 INDUCTION. 

is the cause of a; but that it is either the cause or 
another eflfect of the same cause, may be placed 
beyond any reasonable doubt by the Method of Agree- 
ment, provided the instances are very numerous, as 
well as sufficiently various. 

After how great a multiplication, then, of varied 
instances, all agreeing in no other antecedent except 
A, is the supposition of a plurality of causes suffi- 
ciently rebutted, and the conclusion that- a is the 
effect of A divested of the characteristic imperfection 
and reduced to a virtual certainty ? This is a ques- 
tion which we cannot be exempted from answering ; 
but the consideration of it belongs to what is called 
the Theory of Probability, which will form the subject 
of a chapter hereafter. It is seen, however, at once 
that the conclusion does amount to a practical 
certainty after a sufficient number of instances, and 
that the method, therefore, is not radically vitiated 
by the characteristic imperfection. The result of 
these considerations is only, in the first place, to 
point out a new source of inferiority in the Method of 
Agreement as compared with other modes of investi- 
gation, and new reasons for never resting contented 
with the results obtained by it, without attempting to 
confirm them either by the Method of Difference, or 
by connecting them deductively with some law or 
laws already ascertained by that superior method. 
And, in the second place, we learn from this, 
the true theory of the value of mere number of 
instances in inductive inquiry. The tendency of 
unscientific inquirers is to rely too much upon num- 
ber, without analysing the instances ; without looking 
closely enough into their nature, to ascertain what 
circumstances are or are not eliminated by means of 
them. Most people hold their conclusions with a

PLURALITY OF CAUSES. 511 

degree of assurance proportioned to the mere mass of 
the experience on which they appear to rest: not 
considering that by the addition of instances to 
instances, all of the same kind, that is, di£Pering from 
one another only in points already recognised as 
immaterial, nothing whatever is added to the evidence 
of the conclusion. A single instance eliminating some 
antecedent which existed in all the other cases, is of 
more value than the greatest multitude of instances 
which are reckoned by their number alone. It is 
necessary, no doubt, to assure ourselves^ by a repeti- 
tion of the observation or experiment, that no error 
has been committed concerning the individual facts 
observed ; and until we have assured ourselves of this, 
instead of varying the circumstances, we cannot too 
scrupulously repeat the same experiment or obser- 
vation without any change. But when once this 
assurance htus been obtained, the multiplication of 
instances which do not exclude any more circum- 
stances would be entirely useless, were it not for the 
Plurality of Causes. 

It is of importance to remark, that the peculiar 
modification of the Method of Agreement which, as 
partaking in some degree of the nature of the Method 
of Difference, I have called the Joint Method of Agree- 
ment and Difference, is not affected by the charac- 
teristic imperfection now pointed out. For, in the 
joint method, it is supposed not only that the instances 
in which a is, agree only in containing A, but also 
that the instances in which a is not, agree only in not 
containing A. Now, if this be so, A must be not 
only the cause of a, but the only possible cause : for 
if there were another, as for example B, then in the 
instances in which a is not, B must have been absent 
as well as A, and it would not be true that these

512 INDUCTION. 

instances agree only in not containing A. This, there- 
fore, constitutes an immense advantage of the joint 
method over the simple Method of Agreement. It 
may seem, indeed, that the advantage does not belong 
so much to the joint method, as to one of its two pre- 
misses (if they may be so called), the negative premiss. 
The Method of Agreement, when apphed to negative 
instances, or those in which a phenomenon does not 
take place, is certainly free from the characteristic 
imperfection which affects it in the affirmative case. 
The negative premiss, it might therefore be supposed, 
could be worked as a simple case of the Method of 
Agreement, without requiring an affirmative premiss 
to be joined with it. But although this is true in 
principle, it is generally altogether impossible to woric 
the Method of Agreement by negative instances with- 
out positive ones: it is so much more difficult to 
exhaust the field of negation than that of affirmation. 
For instance, let the question be^ what is the cause 
of the transparency of bodies ; with what prospect of 
success could we set ourselves to inquire directly in 
what the multifarious substances which are not trans- 
parent, agree ? But we might hope much sooner to 
seize some point of resemblance among the compara- 
tively few and definite species of objects which are 
transparent ; and this being attained, we should quite 
naturally be put upon examining whether the absence 
of this one circumstance be not precisely the point in 
which all opaque substances will be found to re- 
semble. 

The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, 
therefore, or, as I have otherwise called it, the Indirect 
Method of Difference (because, like the Method of 
Difference properly so called, it proceeds by ascertain- 
ing how and in what the cases where the phenomenon

is present, differ from those in which it is absent) is, 
after the direct Method of Difference, the most power- 
ful of the remaining instruments of inductive investi- 
gation ; and in the sciences which depend on pure 
observation, with little or no aid from experiment, 
this method, so well exemplified in the beautiful 
speculation on the cause of dew, is the primary re- 
source, so far as direct appeals to experience are 
concerned. 

$ 3. We have thus far treated Plurality of Causes 
only as a possible supposition, which, until removed, 
renders our inductions uncertain, and have only con- 
sidered by what means, where the plurality does not 
really exist, we may be enabled to disprove it. But 
we must also consider it as a case actually occurring 
in nature, and which, as often as it does occur, our 
methods of induction ought to be capable of ascer- 
taining and establishing. For this, however, there is 
required no peculiar method. When an effect is really 
producible by two or more causes, the process for 
detecting them is in no way different from that by 
which we discover single causes. They may (first) be 
discovered as separate sequences, by separate sets of 
instances. One set of observations or experiments 
shows that the sun is a cause of heat, another that 
friction is a source of it, another that percussion, anor 
ther that electricity, another that chemical action is such 
a source. Or (secondly) the plurality may come to light 
in the course of collating a number of instances, when 
we attempt to find some circumstance in which they 
all agree, and fail in doing so. We find it impossible 
to trace, in all the cases in which the effect is met 
with, any common circumstance. We find that we 
can eliminate all the antecedents ; that no one of them 
VOL. I. 2 L ^ ,

514 INDUCTION. 

is present in all the instances, no one of them indis- 
pensable to the effect. On closer scrutiny, however, 
it appears that though no one is always present, one 
or other of several always is. If, on farther analysis, 
we can detect in these any common element, we may 
be able to ascend from them to some one cause which 
is the really operative circumstance in them all. Thus 
it might, and perhaps will be, discovered, that in the 
production of heat by friction, percussion, chemical 
action, &c., the ultimate source is one and the same. 
But if (as continually happens) we cannot take this 
ulterior step, the different antecedents must be set 
down as distinct causes, each sufficient of itself to 
produce the effect. 

We may here close our remarks on the Plurahty 
of Causes, and proceed to the still more peculiar and 
more complex case of the Intermixture of Effects, and 
the interference of causes with one another : a case 
constituting the principal part of the complication and 
difficulty of the study of nature ; and with which the 
four only possible methods of directly inductive inves- 
tigation by observation and experiment, are for the 
most part, as will appear presently, quite unequal to 
cope. The instrument of Deduction alone is adequate 
to unravel the complexities proceeding from this 
source ; and the four methods have Uttle more in their 
power than to supply premisses for our deductions. 

$ 4. A concurrence of two or more causes, not 
separately producing each its own effect, but interfer- 
ing with or modifying the effects of one another, takes 
place, as has already been explained, in two different 
ways. In the one case, which is exemplified by the 
joint operatioaof different forces in mechanics^ the sepa- 
rate effects of all the causes continue to be produced.

but are compounded with one another, and disappear 
in one total. In the other case, illustrated by the case 
of chemical action, the separate effects cease entirely, 
and are succeeded by phenomena altogether different, 
and governed by different laws. 

Of these cases the former is by far the more fre- 
quent, and this case it is which, for the most part, 
eludes the grasp of our experimental methods. The 
other and exceptional case is essentially amenable to 
them. When the laws of the original agents cease 
entirely, and a phenomenon makes its appearance, 
which, with reference to those laws, is quite hetero* 
geneous ; when, for example, two gaseous substances, 
hydrogen and oxygen, on being brought together, 
throw off their peculiar properties, and produce the 
substance called water; in such cases the new fact 
may be subjected to experimental inquiry, like any 
other phenomenon ; and the elements which are said 
to compose it may be considered as the mere agents 
of its production ; the conditions on which it depends, 
the facts which make up its cause. 

The eff^ects of the new phenomenon, the properties 
of water, for instance, are as easily found by experi- 
ment as the effects of any other cause. But to 
discover the came of it, that is, the particular conjunc- 
tion of agents from which it results, is often difficult 
enough. In the first place, the origin, and actual 
production of the phenomenon, is most frequently 
inaccessible to our observation. If we could not have 
learned the composition of water until we found in- 
stances in which it was actually produced from oxygen 
and hydrogen, we should have been forced to wait 
until the casual thought struck some one of passing an 
electric spark through a mixture of the two gases, or 
inserting a lighted taper into it, merely to try what 

2 L 2^ .

516 INDUCTION. 

would happen. Further, even if we could have ascer- 
tainedy by the Method of Agreement, that oxygen and 
hydrogen were both present when water is produced, 
no experimentation on oxygen and hydrogen sepa- 
rately, no knowledge of their laws, could have enabled 
us deductively to infer that they would produce water. 
We require a specific experiment on the two com- 
bined. 

Under these difficulties, we should generally have 
been indebted for our knowledge of the causes of this 
class of eflfects, not to any inquiry directed specifically 
towards that end, but either to accident, or to the 
gradual progress of experimentation on the different 
combinations of which the producing agents are sus- 
ceptible ; if it were not for a peculiarity belonging to 
effects of this description, that they often, under some 
particular combination of circumstances, re-produce 
their causes. If water results from the juxta- position 
of hydrogen and oxygen whenever this can be made 
sufficiently close and intimate, so, on the other hand, 
if water itself be placed in certain situations, hydrogen 
and oxygen are re-produced from it : an abrupt termi- 
nation is put to the new laws, arid the agents re- 
appear separately with their own properties as at 
first. What is called chemical analysis is the process 
of searching for the causes of a phenomenon among 
its eflfects, or rather among the eflfects produced by the 
action of some other causes upon it. 

Lavoisier, by heating mercury to a high tempera- 
ture in a close vessel containing air, found that the 
mercury increased in weight and became what was 
then called red precipitate, while the air, on being 
examined after the experiment, proved to have lost 
weight, and to have become incapable of supporting 
life or combustion. When red precipitate was exposed

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 517 

to a still greater heat, it became mercury again, and gave 
off a gas which did support life and flame. Thus the 
agents which by their combination produced red pre- 
cipitate, namely the mercury and the gas, reappear as 
effects resulting from that precipitate when acted upon 
by heat. So, if we decompose water by means of iron 
filings, we produce two effects, rust and hydrogen: now 
rust is already known by experiments upon the com- 
ponent substances, to be an effect of the union of iron 
and oxygen : the iron we ourselves suppUed, but the 
oxygen must have been produced from the water. 
The result therefore is that the water has disappeared, 
and hydrogen and oxygen have appeared in its stead : 
or in other words, the original laws of these gaseous 
agents, which had been suspended by the superinduc- 
tion of the new laws called the properties of water, 
have again started into existence, and the causes of 
water are found among its effects. 

Where two phenomena, between the laws or pro- 
perties of which considered in themselves no con- 
nexion can be traced, are thus reciprocally cause and 
effect, each capable in its turn of being produced from 
the other, and each, when it produces the other, ceasing 
itself to exist (as water is produced from oxygen and 
hydrogen, and oxygen and hydrogen are re-produced 
from water) ; this causation of the two phenomena by 
one another, each of them being generated by the 
other's destruction, is properly transformation. The 
idea of chemical composition is an idea of transforma- 
tion, but of a transformation which is incomplete; 
since we consider the oxygen and hydrogen to be pre- 
sent in the water as oxygen and hydrogen, and capable 
of being discovered in it if our senses were sufficiently 
keen : a supposition (for it is no more) grounded solely 
upon the fact, that the weight of the water is the sum

518 INDUCTION. 

of the separate weights of the two ingredients. If 
there had not been this exception to the entire disap- 
pearance, in the compound, of the laws of the separate 
ingredients ; if the combined agents had not, in this 
one particular of weight, preserved their own laws, 
and produced a joint result equal to the sum of their 
separate results ; we should never, probably, have had 
the notion now implied by the words chemical com- 
position: and, in the fact of water produced from 
hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen and oxygen pro- 
duced from water, as the transformation would have 
been complete, we should have seen only a trans- 
formation. 

In these casesj then, when the heteropathic effect 
(as we called it in a former chapter) is but a trans- 
formation of its cause, or in other words, when the 
effect and its cause sure reciprocally such, and mutu- 
ally convertible into each other; the problem of 
finding the cause resolves itself into the far easier one 
of finding an effect, which is the kind of inquiry that 
admits of being prosecuted by direct experiment. But 
there are other cases of heteropathic effects to which 
this mode of investigation is not applicable. Take, for 
instance, the heteropathic laws of mind ; that portion 
of the phenomena of our mental nature which are 
analogous to chemical rather than to dynamical phe- 
nomena ; as when a complex passion is formed by the 
coalition of several elementary impulses, or a complex 
emotion by several simple pleasures or pains, of which 
it is the result, without being the aggregate, or in any 
respect homogeneous with thenu The product, in 
these cases, is generated by its various factors ; but 
the factors cannot be re-produced from the product : 
just as a youth can grow into an old man, but an oljl 
man cannot grow into a youth. We cannot ascertain

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 519 

from what simple feelings any of our complex states 
of mind are generated, as we ascertain the ingredients 
of a chemical compound, by making it, in its turn, 
generate them. We can only, therefore, discover 
these laws by the slow process of studying the simple 
feelings themselves, and ascertaining synthetically, by 
experimenting on the various combinations of which 
they are susceptible, what they, by their mutual 
action upon one another, are capable of generating. 

§ 5. It might have been supposed that the other^ 
and apparently simpler variety of the mutual inter- 
ference of causes, where each cause continues to pro- 
duce its own proper effect according to the same laws 
to which it conforms in its separate state, would have 
presented fewer difficulties to the inductive inquirer 
than that of which we have just finished the consider- 
aticm. It presents, however, so far as direct induction 
apart from deduction is concerned^ infinitely greater 
difficulties. When a concurrence of causes gives rise 
to a new efiect bearing no relati(ui to the separate 
effects of those causes, the resultii^ phenomenon at 
least stands forth undisguised, inviting attention to its 
peculiarity, and presenting no obstacle to our recog- 
nising its presence or absence among any number of 
surrounding phenomena. It admits therefore of being 
easily brought under the canons of induction, provided 
instances can be obtained such as those canons require : 
and the non-occurrence of such instances, or the want 
of means to produce them artificially, is the real and 
only difficulty in such investigations ; a difficulty not 
logical, but in some sort physical. It is otherwise 
with cases of what, in a preceding chapter, has been 
denominated the Composition of Causes. There, the 
effects of the separate causes do not terminate and

520 INDUCTION. 

give place to others, thereby ceasing to form any part 
of the phenomenon to be investigated ; on the con- 
trary they still take place, but are intermingled with, 
and disguised by, the homogeneous and closely-alhed 
effects of other causes. They are no longer a, 6, c, d, e, 
existing side by side, and continuing to be separately 
discernible; they are + a, — a, ^6, — » 6, 2 6, &c., some 
of which cancel one another, while many others do 
not appear distinguishabiy but merge in one sum : 
forming altogether a result, between which and the 
causes whereby it was produced there is often an 
insurmountable difficulty in tracing by observation any 
fixed relation whatever. 

The general idea of the Composition of Causes has 
been seen to be, that although two or more laws 
interfere with one another, and apparently frustrate 
or modify one another's operation, yet in reality all 
are fulfilled, the collective effect being the exact sum 
total of the effects of the causes taken separately. A 
familiar instance is that of a body kept in equilibrium 
by two equal and contrary forces. One of the forces 
if acting alone would carry it so far to the west, the 
other if acting alone would carry it exactly as far 
towards the east : and the result is the same as if it 
had been first carried to the west as far as the one 
force would carry it, and then back towards the east 
as far as the other would carry it, that is, precisely 
the same distance ; being ultimately left where it was 
found at first. 

All laws of causation are liable to be in this 
manner counteracted, and seemingly frustrated, by 
coming into conflict with other laws, the separate 
result of which is opposite to theirs, or more or less 
inconsistent with it. And hence, with almost every 
law, many instances in which it really is entirely

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 521 

fulfilled, do not, at first sight, appear to be cases of 
its operation at all. It is so in the example just 
adduced : a force, in mechanics, means neither more 
nor less than a cause of motion, yet the sum of the 
effects of two causes of motion may be rest. Again, 
a body solicited by two forces in directions making 
an angle with one another, moves in the diago- 
nal; and it seems a paradox to say' that motion in 
the diagonal is the sum of two motions in two other 
lines. Motion, however, is but change of place, and 
at every instant the body is in the exact place it 
would have been in if the forces had acted during 
alternate instants instead of acting in the same in- 
stant; (saving that if we suppose two forces to act suc- 
cessively which are in truth simultaneous, we must of 
course allow them double the time.) It is evident, 
therefore, that each force has had, during each instant, 
all the effect which belonged to it ; and that the modi- 
fying influence which one of two concurrent causes is 
said to exercise with respect to the other, may be 
considered as exerted not over the action of the cause 
itself, but over the effect after it is completed. For 
all purposes of predicting, calculating, or explaining 
their joint result, causes which compoimd their effects 
may be treated as if they produced simultaneously 
each of them its own effect, and all these effects co- 
existed visibly. 

Since the laws of causes are as really fulfilled when 
the causes are said to be coimteracted by opposing 
causes, as when they are left to their own undisturbed 
action, we must be cautious not to express the laws in 
such terms as would render the assertion of their being 
fulfilled in those cases a contradiction. If, for in- 
stance, it were stated as a law of nature that a body 
to which a force is applied moves in the direction of 

Digitized by VLjOOQiC 



522 INDUCTION. 

the force, with a velocity proportioned to the force 
directly, and to its own mass inversely ; when in point 
of fact some bodies to which a force is applied do not 
move at all, and those which do move are, from the 
very first, retarded by the action of gravity and other 
resisting forces, and at last stopped altogether ; it is 
clear that the general proposition, although it would 
be true under a certain hypothesis, would not express 
the facts as they actually occur. To acconmiodate 
the expression of the law to the real phenomena, we 
must say, not that the object moves, but that it tends 
to move in the direction and with the velocity speci- 
fied. We might, indeed, guard our expression in a 
different mode, by saying that the body moves in that 
manner unless prevented, or except in so fieur as pre- 
vented by some coimteracting cause. But the body 
does not only move in that manner unless counter- 
acted ; it tends to move in that manner even when 
counteracted ; it still exerts, in the original direction, 
the same energy of movement as if its first impulse 
had been undisturbed, and produces, by that energy, 
an exactly equivalent quantity of effisct. This is true 
eveia when the force leaves the body as it foimd it, in 
a state of absolute rest ; as when we attempt to raise 
a body of three tons weight with a force equal to one 
ton. For if, while we are applying this force, the wind 
or water or any other agent supplies an additional 
force just exceeding two tons, the body will be raised ; 
thus proving that the force we applied exerted its full 
effect, by neutralizing an equivalent portion of the 
weight which it was insufficient altogether to over- 
come. And if, while we are exerting this force of one 
ton upon the object in a direction contrary to that of 
gravity, it be put into a scale and weighed, it will be 
found to have lost a ton of its weight, or, in other

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 523 

words, to press downwards with a force only equal to 
the diiSerence of the two forces. 

These facts are correctly indicated by the expres- 
sion tendency* All laws of causation^ in consequence 
of their liability to be counteracted, require to be 
stated in words affirmative of tendencies only, and not 
of actual results. In those sciences of causation 
which have an accurate nomenclature, there are spe- 
cial words which signify a tendency to the particular 
effect with which the science is conversant; thus 
pressurey in mechanics, is synonymous with tendency 
to motion, and forces are not reasoned upon as causing 
actual motion, but as exerting pressure. A similar 
improvement in terminology would be very salutary 
in many other branches of science. 

The habit of neglecting this necessary element in 
the precise expression of the laws of nature, has given 
birth to the popular prejudice that all general truths 
have exceptions; and much unmerited distrust has 
thence accrued to the conclusions of philosophy, when 
they have been submitted to the judgment of persons 
who were not philosophers. The rough generaliza- 
tions suggested by common observation usually have 
exceptions ; but the principles of science, or in other 
words, the laws of causation, have not ^* What is 
thought to be an exception to a principle,*' (to quote 
words used on a different occasion,) ^* is always some 
other and distinct principle cutting into the former ; 
some other force which impinges against the first force, 
and deflects it from its direction. There are not a 
law and an exception to that law, the law acting in 
ninety-nine cases and the exception in one. There 
are two laws, each possibly actii^ in the whole hun- 
dred cases, and bringing about a common effect by 
their conjunct operation. If the force which, being 



Digitized 



by Google 



524 INDUCTION, 

the less conspicuous of the two, is called the disturb- 
ing force, prevails sufficiently over the other force in 
some one case, to constitute that case what is com- 
monly called an exception, the same disturbing force 
probably acts as a modifying cause in many other cases 
which no one will call exceptions. 

'* Thus if it were stated to be a law of nature that 
aU heavy bodies fall to the groimd, it would probably 
be said that the resistance of the atmosphere, which 
prevents a balloon from falling, constitutes the balloon 
an exception to that pretended law of nature. But 
the real law is, that all heavy bodies tend to fall ; and 
to this there is no exception, not even the sun and 
moon ; for even they, as every astronomer knows, 
tend towards the earth, with a force exactly equal to 
that with which the earth tends towards them. The 
resistance of the atmosphere might, in the particular 
case of the balloon, from a misapprehension of what 
the law of gravitation is, be said to prevail over the 
law ; but its disturbing effect is quite as real in every 
other case, since though it does not prevent, it retards 
the fall of all bodies whatever. The rule, and the 
so-called exception, do not divide the cases between 
them ; each of them is a comprehensive rule extend- 
ing to all cases. To call one of these concurrent 
principles an exception to the other, is superficial, and 
contrary to the correct principles of nomenclature and 
arrangement. An effect of precisely the same kind, and 
arising from the same cause, ought not to be placed 
in two different categories, merely as there does or does 
not exist another cause preponderating over it.*' 

§ 6. We have now to consider according to what 
method these complex effects, compounded of the 
effects of many causes, are to be studied ; how we are 



Digitized

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 625 

enabled to trace each effect to the concurrence of 
causes in which it originated, and ascertain the con- 
ditions of its recurrence, the circumstances in which 
it may be expected again to occur. The conditions 
of a phenomenon which arises from a composition 
of causes, may be investigated either deductively or 
experimentally. 

The case, it is evident^ is naturally susceptible of 
the deductive mode of investigation. The law of an 
effect of this description is a result of the laws of the 
separate causes on the combination of which it depends, 
and is therefore in itself capable of being deduced 
from these laws. This is called the method a priori. 
The other, or a posteriori method, professes to pro- 
ceed according to the canons of experimental inquiry. 
Considering the whole assemblage of concurrent 
causes which produced the phenomenon, as one single 
cause, it attempts to ascertain that cause in the ordi- 
nary manner, by a comparison of instances. This 
second method subdivides itself into two different 
varieties. If it merely collates instances of the effect, 
it is a method of pure observation. If it operates 
upon the causes, and tries different combinations of 
them in hopes of ultimately hitting the precise combi- 
nation which will produce the given total effect, it is 
a method of experiment. 

In order more completely to clear up the nature of 
each of these three methods, and determine which of 
them deserves the preference, it will be expedient 
(conformably to a favourite maxim of Lord Chancellor 
Eldon, to which, though it has often incurred philo- 
sophical ridicule, a deeper philosophy will not refuse 
its sanction,) to ** clothe them in circumstances." 
We shall select for this purpose a case which as yet 
furnishes no very brilliant example of the success of

526 INDUCTION. 

any of the three methods, but which is all the more 
suited to illustrate the difficulties inherent in them. 
Let the subject of inquiry be, the conditions of health 
and disease in the human body ; or (for greater sim- 
plicity,) the conditions of recovery from a given dis- 
ease ; and in order to narrow the question still more, 
let it be limited, in the first instance, to this one 
inquiry: Is, or is not some particular medicament 
(mercury, for instance,) a remedy for that disease. 

Now, the deductive method would set out from 
known properties of mercury, and known laws of the 
human body, and by reasoning firom these, would 
attempt to discover whether mercury will act upon 
the body when in the morbid condition supposed, in 
such a manner as to restore health. The experi- 
mental method would simply administer mercury in 
as many cases as possible, noting the age, sex, tempe- 
rament, and other peculiarities of bodily constitution, 
the particular form or variety of the disease, the par- 
ticular stage of its progress, &c., remarking in which 
of these cases it produced a salutary effect, and with 
what circumstances it was on those occasions com- 
bined. The method of simple observation would com- 
pare instances of recovery, to find whether they agreed 
in having been preceded by the administration of mer- 
cury ; or would compare instances of recovery with 
instances of failure, to find cases which, agreeing in 
all other respects, differed only in the fact that mer- 
cury had been administered, or that it had not. 

$ 7. That the last of these three modes of inves- 
tigation is applicable to the case, no one has ever seri- 
ously contended. No conclusions of value, on a sub- 
ject of such intricacy, ever were obtained in that way. 
The utmost that could result would be a vague general

impression for or against the efficacy of mercury, of 
no real avail for guidance unless confirmed by one of 
the other two methods. Not that the results, which this 
method strives to obtain, would not be of the utmost 
possible value if they could be obtained. If all the cases 
of recovery which presented themselves, in an examina- 
tion extending to a great number of instances, were 
cases in which mercury had been administered, we 
might generalize with confidence from this experience, 
and should have obtained a conclusion of real value. 
But no such basis for generalization can we, in a case 
of this description, hope to obtain. The reason is 
that which we have so often spoken of as constituting 
the characteristic imperfection of the Method of Agree- 
ment ; Plurality of Causes. Supposing even that 
mercury does tend to cure the disease, so many other 
causes, both natural and artificial, also tend to cure it, 
that there are sure to be abundant instances of reco- 
very in which mercury has not been administered: 
unless, indeed, the practice be to administer it in all 
cases ; on which supposition it will equally be found 
in the cases of failure. 

When an effect results from the union of many 
causes, the share which each has in the determination 
of the effect cannot in general be great : and the effect 
is not likely, even in its presence or absence, still less 
in its variations^ to follow very exactly any one of the 
causes. Recovery from a disease is an event to which, 
in every case, many influences must concur. Mercury 
may be one such influence ; but, from the very fact 
that there are many other such, it will necessarily 
happen that although mercury is administered, the 
patient, for want of other concurring influences, will 
often not recover, and that he often will recover when 
it is not administered, the other favourable influences

being sufficiently powerfiil without it. Neither, there- 
fore, will the instances of recovery agree in the admi- 
nistration of mercury, nor will the instances of failure 
agree in the non-admmistration of it. It is much if, 
by. multiplied and accurate returns from hospitals and 
the like, we can collect that there are rather more 
recoveries and rather fewer failures when mercury is 
administered than when it is not ; a result of very 
secondary value even as a guide to practice, and almost 
worthless as a contribution to the theory of the subject. 

§ 8. The inappUcability of the method of simple 
observation to ascertain the conditions of effects de- 
pendent on many concurring causes, being thus recog- 
nised ; we shall next inquire whether any greater 
benefit can be expected from the other branch of the 
ct posteriori method, that which proceeds by directly 
trying diflFerent combinations of causes, either arti- 
ficially produced or found in nature, and takmg notice 
what is their eflfect : as, for example, by actually trying 
the eflFect of mercury, in as many different circum- 
stances as possible. This method differs from the one 
which we have just examined, in turning our attention 
directly to the causes or agents, instead of turning it to 
the eflfect, recovery from the disease. And since, as a 
general rule, the effects of causes are far more acces* 
sible to our study than the causes of effects, it is 
natural to think that this method may be successful 
although the former must necessarily fail. 

The method now under consideration is called the 
Empirical Method ; and in order to estimate it fairly, 
we must suppose it to be completely, not incom- 
pletely, empirical. We must exclude from it every- 
thing which partakes of the nature not of an expe- 
rimental but of a deductive operation. If for instance

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 529 

we tiy experiments with mercury upon a person in 
health, in order to ascertain the general laws of its 
action upon the human body, and then reason from 
these laws to determine how it will act upon persons 
affected with a particular disease, this may be a really 
effectual method, but this is deduction. The experi- 
mental method does not derive the law of a complex 
case from the simpler laws which conspire to pro- 
duce it, but makes its experiments directly upon the 
complex case. We must make entire abstraction of 
all knowledge of the simpler tendencies, the modi 
operandi of mercury in detail; our experimentation 
must aim at obtaining a direct answer to the specific 
question. Does or does not mercury tend to cure the 
particular disease ? 

Let us see, therefore, how far this case admits of the 
observance of those rules of experimentation, which it 
is found necessary to observe in other cases. When 
we devise an experiment to ascertain the effect of a 
given agent, there are certain precautions which we 
never, if we can help it, omit. In the first place, we 
introduce the agent into the midst of a set of circum- 
stances which we have exactly ascertained. It needs 
hardly be remarked how far this condition is from 
being realized in any case connected with the pheno- 
mena of life ; how far we are from knowing what are 
all the circumstances which pre-exist in any instance 
in which mercury is administered to a living being. 
This diificulty, however, though insuperable in most 
cases, may not be so in all; there are sometimes (though 
I should think never in physiology) concurrences 
of many causes, in which we yet know accurately 
what the causes are. But when we have got clear of 
this obstacle we encounter another still more serious. 
In other cases, when we intend to try an experiment, 

VOL. I. DiMyGoogle 



530 INDUCTION. 

we do not reckon it enough that there be no circum- 
stance in the case, the presence of which is unknown 
to us. We require also that none of the circum- 
stances which we do know of, shall have effects 
susceptible of being confounded with those of the 
agent whose properties we wish to study. We take 
the utmost pains to exclude all causes capable of 
composition with the given cause ; or if forced to let 
in any such causes, we take care to make them such, 
that we can compute and allow for their influence, so 
that the effect of the given cause may, after the sub- 
duction of those other effects, be apparent as a 
residual phenomenon. 

These precautions are inapplicable to such cases 
as we are now considering. The mercury of our 
experiment being tried with an unknown multitude 
(or even let it be a known multitude) of other influ- 
encing circumstances ^ the mere fact of their being 
influencing circumstances implies that they disguise 
the effect of the mercury, and preclude us from 
knowing whether it has any effect or no. Unless we 
already knew what and how much is owing to every 
other circumstance (that is, unless we suppose the 
very problem solved which we are considering the 
means of solving), we cannot tell that those other 
circumstances may not have produced the whole of 
the effect, independently or even in spite of the mer- 
cury. The Method of Difference, in the ordinary 
mode of its use, namely, by comparing the state of 
things following the experiment with the state which 
preceded it, is thus, in the case of intermixture of 
effects, entirely unavailing ; because other causes than 
that whose effect we are seeking to determine, have 
been operating during the transition. As for the 
other mode of employing the Method of Difference,

INTERMIXTURE OF EFFECTS. 531 

namely, by comparing, not the same case at two 
different periods, but different cases, this in the pre- 
sent instance is quite chimerical. In phenomena so 
complicated it is questionable if two cases similar in 
all respects but one ever occurred ; and were they to 
occur, we could not possibly know that they were so 
exactly similar. 

Anything like a scientific use of the method of 
experiment, in these complicated cases, is therefore 
out of the question. We can in the most favourable 
cases only discover, by a succession of trials, that a 
certain cause is very often followed by a certain effect* 
For, in one of these conjunct effects, the portion 
which iq determined by any one of the influencing 
agents, is generally, as we before remarked, but small ; 
and it must be a more potent cause than most, if even 
the tendency which it really exerts is not thwarted by 
other tendencies in nearly as many cases as it is 
fulfilled. 

If so little can be done by the experimental 
method to determine the conditions of an effect of 
many combined causes, in the case of medical science, 
still less is this method applicable to a class of phe- 
nomena more complicated than even those of phy- 
siology, the phenomena of poUtics and history. 
There, Plurality of Causes exists in almost boundless 
excess, and the effects are, for the most part, inex- 
tricably interwoven with one another. To add to the 
embarrassment, most of the inquiries in political 
science relate to the production of effects of a most 
comprehensive description, such as the public wealth, 
public security, public morality, and the like: results 
liable to be affected directly or indirectly either in plus 
or in minus by nearly every fact which exists, or 
event which occurs, * in human society. The vulgar

notion, that the safe methods on political subjects are 
those of Baconian induction, that the true guide is 
not general reasoning but specific experience, will 
one day be quoted as among the most unequivocal 
marks of a low state of the speculative faculties in 
any age in which it is accredited. What can be more 
ludicrous than the sort of parodies on experimental 
reasoning which one is accustomed to meet with, 
not in popular discussion only, but in grave treatises 
when the affairs of nations are the theme. " How," 
it is asked, '^ can an institution be bad, when the 
country has prospered under it?'' *' How can such 
or such causes have contributed to the prosperity of 
one country, when another has prospered without 
them?" Whoever makes use of an argument of this 
kind, not intending to deceive, should be sent back 
to learn the elements of some one of the more easy 
physical sciences. Such reasoners ignore the fact of 
Plurality of Causes in the very case which affords the 
most signal example of it. So little could be concluded , 
in such a case, from an)' possible collation of indi- 
vidual instances, that even the impossibility, in 
social phenomena, of making artificial experiments, a 
circumstance otherwise so prejudicial to directly in- 
ductive inquiry, hardly affords, in this case, additional 
reason of regret. For even if we could try experi- 
ments upon a nation, or upon the human race, with 
as little scruple as M. Majendie tries them upon dogs 
or rabbits, we should never succeed in making two 
instances identical in ever)- respect except the pre- 
sence or absence of some one definite circumstance. 
The nearest approach to an experiment, in the phi- 
losophical sense, which takes place in politics, is the 
introduction of a new operative element into national 
affairs by some special and assignable measure of

government, such as the enactment or repeal of a 
particular law. But, where there are so many in- 
fluences at work, it requires some time for the 
influence of any new cause upon national phenomena 
to become apparent; and as the causes operating in 
so extensive a sphere are not only infinitely numerous, 
but in a state of perpetual alteration, it is always 
certain that before the effect of the new cause becomes 
conspicuous enough to be a subject of induction, so 
many of the other influencing circumstances will have 
changed as to vitiate the experiment. 

Two, therefore, of the three possible methods for 
the study of phenomena resulting from the compo- 
sition of many causes, being, from the very nature of 
the case, ineflicient and illusory ; there remains only 
the third, — that which considers the causes sepa- 
rately, and computes the effect from the balance of 
the different tendencies which produce it: in short, 
the deductive, or a priori method. The more parti- 
cular consideration of this intellectual process requires 
a chapter to itself.

Chapter XL 
OF THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. 

§ 1. The mode of investigation which, from the 
proved inapplicability of direct methods of observation 
and experiment, remains to us as the main source of 
the knowledge we possess, or can acquire, respecting 
the conditions, and laws of recurrence, of the more 
complex phenomena, is called, in its most general 
expression, the Deductive Method; and consists of 
three operations : the first, one of direct induction ; 
the second, of ratiocination; and the third, of 
verification. 

I call the first step in the process an inductive 
operation, because there must be a direct induction 
as the basis of the whole; although in many particular 
investigations the place of the induction may be 
supplied by a prior deduction ; but the premisses of 
this prior deduction must have been derived from 
induction. 

The problem of the Deductive Method is, to find 
the law of an effect, from the laws of the different 
tendencies of which it is the joint result. The first 
requisite, therefore, is to know the laws of those ten- 
dencies; the law of each of the concurrent causes: and 
this supposes a previous process of observation or 
experiment upon each cause separately ; or else a 
previous deduction, which also must depend for its 
ultimate premisses upon observation or experiment. 
Thus, if the subject be social, or historical phenomena, 
the premisses of the Deductive Method must be the

THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. 535 

laws of the causes which determine that class of phe- 
nomena; and those causes are human actions, toge- 
ther with the general outward circumstances imder 
the dominion of which mankind are placed, and which 
constitute man's position in this world; The Deduc- 
tive Method, applied to social phenomena, must 
begin, therefore, by investigating, or must suppose 
to have been already investigated, the laws of human 
action, and those properties of outward things by 
which the actions of human beings in society are 
determined. Some of these general truths will natu- 
rally be obtained by observation and experiment, 
others by deduction: the more complex laws of 
human action, for example, may be deduced from the 
simpler ones ; but the simple or elementary laws will 
always, and necessarily, have been obtained by a 
directly inductive process. 

To ascertain, then, the laws of each separate 
cause which takes a share in producing the effect, is 
the first desideratum of the Deductive Method. To 
know what the causes are, which must be subjected to 
this process of study, may or may not be difl5cult. 
In the case last mentioned, this first condition is 
of easy fulfilment. That social phenomena depended 
upon the acts and mental impressions of human 
beings, never could have been a matter of any doubt, 
however imperfectly it may have been known either 
by what laws those impressions and actions are 
governed, or to what social consequences their laws 
naturally lead. Neither, again, after physical science 
had attained a certain development, could there be 
any real doubt where to look for the laws on which 
the phenomena of Ufe depend, since they must be the 
mechanical and chemical laws of the solid and fluid 
substances composing the organised body and the

medium in which it subsists, together with the 
peculiar vital laws of the different tissues constituting 
the organic structure. In other cases, really far more 
simple than these, it was much less obvious in what 
quarter the causes were to be looked for : as in the 
great case of the celestial phenomena. Until, by 
combining the laws of certain causes, it was found 
that those laws explained all the facts which expe- 
rience had proved concerning the heavenly motions, 
and led to predictions which it always verified, man- 
kind never knew that those were the causes. But 
whether we are able to put the question before or 
not until after we have become capable of answering 
it, in either case it must be answered ; the laws of 
the diflferent causes must be ascertained, before we 
can proceed to deduce from them the conditions of 
the effect. 

The mode of ascertaining these laws neither is, 
nor can be, any other than the fourfold method of 
experimental inquiry, already discussed. A few 
remarks on the application of that method to cases 
of the Composition of Causes, are all .that is requisite. 

It is obvious that we cannot expect to find the 
law of a tendency, by an induction from cases in 
which the tendency is counteracted. The laws of 
motion could never have been brought to light from 
the observation of bodies kept at rest by the equi- 
librium of opposing forces. Even where the tendency 
is not, in the ordinary sense of the word, counteracted, 
but only modified, by having its effects compounded 
with the effects arising from some other tendency or 
tendencies, we are still in an unfavourable position for 
tracing, by means of such cases, the law of the ten- 
dency itself. It would have been diflScult to discover 
the law that every body in motion tends to continue

THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. 537 

moving in a straight line, by an induction from 
instances in which the motion is deflected into a 
curve, by being compounded with the effect of an 
accelerating force. Notwithstanding the resources 
afforded in this description of cases by the Method of 
Concomitant Variations, the principles of a judicious 
experimentation prescribe that the law of each of the 
tendencies should be studied, if possible, in cases in 
which that tendency operates alone, or in combina- 
tion with no agencies but those of which the effect 
can, from previous knowledge, be calculated and 
allowed for. 

Accordingly, in the cases, unhappily very nume- 
rous and important, in which the causes do not suffer 
themselves to be separated and observed apart, there 
is much dilEculty in laying down, with due certainty, 
the inductive foundation necessary to support the 
deductive method. This difficulty is most conspi- 
cuous in the case of physiological phenomena; it 
being impossible to separate the different agencies 
which collectively compose an organised body, with- 
out destroying the very phenomena which it is our 
object to investigate : 

following -life, in creatures we disdect, 

We lose it, in the moment we detect. 

And for this reason I am not quite prepared to agree 
with M. Comte, in deeming the science of society 
and government intrinsically a more difficult study 
than the science of organic and animal life. I cannot 
but incline to the opinion, that physiology is embar- 
rassed by greater natural difficulties, and is probably 
susceptible of a less degree of ultimate perfection, than 
the social science ; inasmuch as it is possible to study 
the laws of one man's mind and actions apart from 
other men, much less imperfectly than we can study 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



538 INDUCTION. 

the laws of one organ or tissue of the human body 
apart from the other organs or tissues. 

It is profoundly remarked by M. Comte, that 
pathological facts, or, to speak in common language, 
diseases in their different forms and degrees, afford in 
the case of physiological investigation the nearest 
equivalent to experimentation properly so called; 
inasmuch as they often exhibit to us a definite disturb- 
ance in some one organ or organic function, the 
remaining organs and functions being, in the first 
instance at • least, unaffected. It is true that from 
the perpetual actious and reactions which are going 
on among all the parts of the organic economy, there 
can be no prolonged disturbance in any one function 
without ultimately invoking many of the others ; and 
when once it has done so, the experiment for the 
most part loses its scientific value. All depends upon 
observing the early stages of the derangement; which, 
unfortunately, are of necessity the least marked. If, 
however, the organs and functions not disturbed in 
the first instance, become affected in a fixed order of 
succession, some light is thereby thrown upon the 
action which one organ exercises over another ; and 
we occasionally obtain a series of effects, which we 
can refer with some confidence to the original local 
derangement ; but for this it is necessary that we 
should know that the original derangement was local. 
If it was what is termed constitutional, that is, if 
we do not know in what part of the animal economy 
it took its rise, or the precise nature of the disturb- 
ance which took place in that part, we are unable to 
determine which of the various derangements was 
cause and which effect; which of them were produced 
by one another, and which by the direct, though 
perhaps tardy, action of the original cause.

THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. 539 

Besides natural pathological facts, we can pro- 
duce pathological facts artificially; we can try experi- 
ments, even in the popular sense of the term, by 
subjecting the living being to some external agent, 
such as the mercury of our former example. As this 
experimentation is not intended to obtain a direct 
solution of any practical question, but to discover 
general laws, from which afterwards the conditions of 
any particular effect may be obtained by deduction ; 
the best cases to select are those of which the circum- 
stances can be best ascertained : and such are generally 
not those in which there is any practical object in 
view. The experiments are best tried, not in a state 
of disease, which is essentially a changeable state, but 
in the condition of health, comparatively a fixed state. 
In the one, unusual agencies are at work, the results 
of which wc have no means of predicting ; in the 
other, the course of the accustomed physiological 
phenomena would, it may generally be presumed, 
remain undisturbed, were it not for the disturbing 
cause which we introduce. 

Such, with the occasional aid of the method of Con- 
comitant Variations, (the latter not less encumbered 
than the more elementary methods, by the peculiar 
difficulties of the subject,) are our inductive resources 
for ascertaining the laws of the causes considered 
separately, when we have it not in our power to make 
trial of them in a state of actual separation. The 
insufficiency of these resources is so glaring, that no 
one can be surprised at the backward state of the 
science of physiology; in which indeed our knowledge 
of causes is so imperfect, that we can neither explain, 
nor could, without specific experience, have predicted 
many of the facts which are certified to us by the 
most ordinary observation. Fortunately, we are 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



540 INDUCTION. 

much better informed as to the empirical laws of the 
phenomena, that is, the uniformities respecting which 
we cannot yet decide whether they are cases of 
causation or mere results of it. Not only has the 
order in which the facts of organization and life 
successively manifest themselves, from the first germ 
of existence to death, been found to be uniform, and 
very accurately ascertainable; but, moreover, by a 
great application of the Method of Concomitant 
Variations to the entire facts of comparative anatomy 
and physiology, the conditions of organic structure 
corresponding to each class of functions have been 
determined with considerable precision*. Whether 
these organic conditions are the whole of the condi- 
tions, and whether they be conditions at all, or mere 
collateral effects of some common cause, we are quite 
ignorant : nor are we ever likely to know, unless we 
could construct an organized body, and try whether it 
would live. 

Under such disadvantages do we, in cases of this 
description, attempt the initial, or inductive step, in 
the application of the Deductive Method to complex 
phenomena. But such, fortunately, is not the 
common case. In general, the laws of the causes on 
which the effect depends may be obtained by an 
induction from comparatively simple instances, or, at 
the worst, by deduction from the laws of simpler 
causes so obtained By simple instances are meant, 
of course, those in which the action of each cause was 
not intermixed or interfered with, or not to any great 
extent, by other causes whose laws were unknown. 



^ This great philosophical operation has been admirably charac- 
terized in the third volume of M. Comte's truly eneycloptdical 
work.

And only when the induction which furnished the 
premisses to the Deductive Method rested upon such 
instances, has the application of such a method to the 
ascertainment of the laws of a complex effect, been 
attended with brilliant results. 

§ 2. When the laws of the causes have been 
ascertained, and the first stage of the great logical 
operation now under discussion satisfactorily accom- 
plished, the second part follows ; that of determining, 
from the laws of the causes, what effect any given 
combination of those causes will produce. This is a 
process of calculation, in the wider sense of the term ; 
and very often involves processes of calculation in 
the narrowest sense* It is a ratiocination ; and when 
our knowledge of the causes is so perfect, as to ex- 
tend to the exact numerical laws which they observe 
in producing, their effects, the ratiocination may 
reckon among its premisses the theorems of the 
science of number, in the whole immense extent of 
that science. Not only are the highest truths of 
mathematics often required to enable us to compute 
an effect, the numerical law of which we already 
know; but, even by the aid of those highest truths, we 
can go but a little way. In so simple a case as the 
celebrated problem of three bodies gravitating towards 
one another, with a force directly as their mass and 
inversely as the square of the distance, all the re- 
sources of the calculus have not hitherto suflSced to 
obtain anything more than an approximate general 
solution. In a case a little more complex, but still 
one of the simplest which arise in practice, that of the 
motion of a projectile, the causes which affect the 
velocity and range (for example) of a cannon-ball may 
be all known and estimated ; the force of the gun-

powder, the angle of elevation, the density of the air, 
the strength and direction of the sound ; hut it is one 
of the most diflScult of all mathematical problems to 
combine all these, so as to determine the effect 
resulting from their collective action. 

Besides the theorems of number, those of geo- 
metry also come in as premisses, where the effects 
take place in space, and involve motion and extension, 
as in mechanics, optics, acoustics, astronomy. But 
when the complication increases, and the effects are 
under the influence of so many and such shifting 
causes as to give no room either for fixed numbers, or 
for straight lines and regular curves, as in the case of 
physiological, to say nothing of mental and social 
phenomena, the laws of number and extension are 
applicable, if at all, only on that large scale on 
which precision of details becomes unimportant; and 
although these laws play a conspicuous part in the 
most striking examples of the investigation of nature 
by the Deductive Method, as for example in the 
Newtonian theory of the celestial motions, they are 
by no means an indispensable part of every such pro- 
cess. All that is essential in it is the ratiocination 
from a general law to a particular case, that is, the 
determination, by means of the particular circum- 
stances of that case, what result is required in that 
instance to fulfil the law. Thus, in the Torricellian 
experiment, if the fact that air had weight had been 
previously known, it would have been easy, without 
any numerical data, to deduce from the general law 
of equilibrium, that the mercury would stand in the 
tube at such a height that the column of mercury 
would exactly balance a column of the atmosphere of 
equal diameter ; because otherwise, equilibrium would 
not exist.

By such raticionations from the separate laws of 
the causes, we may, to a certain extent, succeed in 
answering either of the following questions : Given a 
certain combination of causes, what effect will follow ? 
and, What combination of causes, if it existed, would 
produce a given effect? In the one case, we deter- 
mine the effect to be expected in any complex circum- 
stances of which the different elements are known : 
in the other case we learn, according to what law — 
under what antecedent conditions — a, given complex 
effect will recur. 

§ 3. But (it may here be asked) are not the same 
arguments by which the methods of direct observation 
and experiment were set aside as illusory when 
applied to the laws of complex phenomena, appli- 
cable with equal force against the Method of De- 
duction? When in every single instance a multitude, 
often an unknown multitude, of agencies, are clashing 
and combining, what security have we that in our 
computation a priori we have taken all these into 
our reckoning? How many must we not generally be 
ignorant of? Among those which we know, how 
probable that some have been overlooked ; and even 
were all included, how vain the pretence of summing 
up the effects of many causes, unless we know accu- 
rately the numerical law of each, — a condition in most 
cases not to be fulfilled; and even when fulfilled, to 
make the calculation transcends, in any but very 
simple cases, the utmost power of mathematical science 
with its most modem improvements. 

These objections truly have much weight, and 
would be altogether unanswerable, if there were no 
test by which, when we employ the Deductive 
Method, we might judge whether an error of any of

the above descriptions had been committed or no. 
Such a test however there is: and its application 
forms, under the name of Verification, the third essen- 
tial component part of theDeductive Method ; without 
which all the results it can give have little other 
value than that of guess-work. To warrant reliance 
upon the general conclusions arrived at by deduction, 
these conclusions must be found, on a careful com- 
parison, to accord with the results of direct observa- 
tion wherever it can be had. If, when we have 
experience to compare with them, this experience 
confirms them, we may safely trust to them in other 
cases of which our specific experience is yet to come. 
But if our deductions have led to the conclusion that 
from a particular combination of causes a given effect 
would result, then in all known cases where that com- 
bination can be shown to have existed, and where the 
effect has not followed, we must be able to show (or 
at least to make a probable surmise) what frustrated 
it: if we cannot, the theory is imperfect, and not yet 
to be relied upon. Nor is the verification complete, 
unless some of the cases in which the theory is borne 
out by the observed result, are of at least equal com- 
plexity with any other cases in which its application 
could be called for. 

It needs scarcely be observed, that if direct observa- 
tion and collation of instances have furnished us with 
any empirical laws of the effect, whether true in all 
observed cases or only true for the most part, the 
most effectual verification of which the theory could 
be susceptible would be, that it led deductively to 
those empirical laws : that the uniformities, whether 
complete or incomplete, which were observed to exist 
among the phenomena, were accounted for by the laws 
of the causes, were such as could not but exist if those

be really the causes by which the phenomena are pro- 
duced. Thus it was very reasonably deemed an essen*- 
tial requisite of any true theory of the causes of the 
celestial motions^ that it should lead by deduction 
to Kepler's laws : which, accordingly, the Newtonian 
theory did- 

In order, therefore, to facilitate the verification of 
theories obtained by deduction, it is important that as 
many as possible of the empirical laws of the pheno- 
mena should be ascertained, by a comparison of 
instances, conformably to the Method of Agreement : 
as well as (it must be added) that the phenomena 
themselves should be described, in the most compre- 
hensive as well as accurate manner possible; by 
collecting from the observation of parts, the simplest 
possible correct expression for the corresponding 
wholes : as when the series of the observed places of a 
planet was first expressed by a system of epicycles, and 
subsequently by an ellipse. 

It is worth remarking, that complex instances 
which would have been of no use for the discovery of 
the simple laws into which we ultimately analyze 
their phenomena, nevertheless, when they have served 
to verify the analysis, become additional evidence of 
the laws themselves. Although we could not have 
got at the law from complex cases, still when the law, 
got at otherwise, is found to be in accordance with 
the result of a complex case, that case becomes a new 
experiment on the law, and helps to confirm what it 
did not assist us to discover. It is a new trial of the 
principle in a different set of circumstances ; and occa- 
sionally serves to eliminate some circumstance not pre- 
viously excluded, and to effect the exclusion of which, 
might require an experiment impossible to be executed. 
This was strikingly conspicuous in the example for-

merly quoted, in which the difference between the 
observed and the calculated velocity of sound was 
ascertained to result from the heat extricated by the 
condensation which takes place in each sonorous 
vibration. This was a trial, in new circumstances, of 
the law of the developement of heat by compression; 
and it certainly added materially to the proof of the uni- 
versality of that law. Accordingly any law of nature 
is deemed to have gained in point of certainty, by 
being found to explain some complex case which had 
not previously been thought of in connexion with it ; 
and this indeed is a consideration to which it is the 
habit of scientific men to attach rather too much value 
than too little. 

To the Deductive Method, thus characterised in 
its three constituent parts, Induction, Ratiocination, 
and Verification, the human mind is indebted for its 
most glorious triumphs in the investigation of nature. 
To it we owe all the theories by which vast and com- 
plicated phenomena are embraced under a few simple 
laws, which, considered as the laws of those great 
phenomena, could never have been detected by their 
direct study. We may form some conception of what 
the method has done for us, from the case of the celes- 
tial motions ; one of the simplest among the greater 
instances of the Composition of Causes, since (except 
in a few cases not of primary importance) each of the 
heavenly bodies may be considered, without material 
inaccuracy, to be never at one time influenced by the 
attraction of more than two bodies, the sun and one 
other planet or satellite, making, with the reaction of 
the body itself, and the tangential force, only four 
different agents on the concurrence of which the 
motions of that body depend; a much smaller number, 
no doubt, than that by which any other of the great

phenomena of nature is determined or modified. Yet 
bow could we ever have ascertained the combination 
of forces upon which the motions of the earth and 
planets are dependent, by merely comparing the orbits^ 
or velocities, of different planets^ or the different 
velocities or positions of the same planet ? Notwith- 
standing the regularity which manifests itself in those 
motions, in a degree so rare among the effects of a 
concurrence of causes ; although the periodical recur- 
rence of exactly the same effect, affords positive proof 
that all the combinations of causes which occur at all^ 
recur periodically; we should never have known what 
the causes were, if the existence of agencies precisely 
similar on our own earth had not, fortunately, brought 
the causes themselves within the reach of experimenta- 
tion under simple circumstances. As we shall have 
occasion to analyze, further on, this great example of 
the Method of Deduction, we shall not occupy any 
time with it here, but shall proceed to that secondary 
application of the Deductive Method, the result of 
which is not to prove laws of phenomena but to 
explain them.

Chapter XII. 
OP THE EXPLANATION OP LAWS OF NATURE. 

^ 1. The deductive operation by which we derive 
the law of an effect from the laws of the causes, of 
which the concurrence gives rise to it, may be under- 
taken either for the purpose of discovering the law, or 
of explaining a law already discovered. The word 
explanation occurs so continually, and holds so im- 
portant a place in philosophy, that a little time 
spent in fixing the meaning of it will be profitably 
employed. 

An individual fact is said to be explained, by 
pointing out its cause, that is, by stating the law or 
laws of causation, of which its production is an 
instance. Thus, a conflagration is explained, when it 
is proved to have arisen from a spark falling into the 
midst of a heap of combustibles. And in a similar 
manner, a law or uniformity in nature is said to be 
explained, when another law or laws are pointed out, 
of which that law itself is but a case, and from which 
it could be deduced. 

§ 2. There are three distinguishable sets of cir- 
cumstances in which a law of causation may be 
explained from, or, as it also is often expressed, 
resolved into, other laws. 

The first is the case already so fully considered ; 
an intermixture of laws, producing a joint effect equal 
to the sum of the effects of the causes taken separately. 
The law of the complex effect is explained, by being 
resolved into the separate laws of the causes which 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 549 

contribute to it. Thus, the law of the motion of a 
planet is resolved into the law of the tangential force, 
which tends to produce an uniform motion in the 
tangent, and the law of the centripetal force, which 
tends to produce an accelerating motion towards 
the sun ; the real motion being a compound of the 
two. 

It is necessary here to remark, that in this resolu- 
tion of the law of a complex effect, the laws of which 
it is compounded are not the only elements. It is 
resolved into the laws of the separate causes, together 
with the fact of their coexistence. The one is as 
essential an ingredient as the other; whether the 
object be to discover the law of the effect, or only to 
explain it. To deduce the laws of the heavenly 
motions, we require not only to know the law of a 
rectilineal and that of a gravitative force, but the 
existence of both these forces in the celestial regions, 
arid even their relative amount. The complex laws 
of causation are thus resolved into two distinct kinds 
of elements : the one, simpler laws of causation, the 
other (in the aptly selected language of Dr. Chalmers) 
collocations ; the collocations consisting in the exist* 
ence of certain agents or powers, in certain circum- 
stances of place and time. We shall hereafter have 
occasion to return to this distinction, and to dwell 
upon it at such a length as dispenses with the neces- 
sity of further insisting upon it here. The first mode, 
then, of the explanation of Laws of Causation, is when 
the law of an effect is resolved into the various ten- 
dencies of which it is the result, and into the laws of 
those tendencies. 

$ 3. A second case is when, between what seemed 
the cause and what was supposed to be its effect. 

Digitized by VjOOQ IC 



650 INDUCTION. 

further observation detects an intermediate link ; a 
fact caused by the antecedent, and in its turn causing 
the consequent; so that the cause at first assigned is 
but the remote cause, operating through the inter- 
mediate phenomenon. A seemed the cause of C, but 
it subsequently appeared that A was only the cause 
of B, and that it is B which was the cause of C. For 
example : mankind were aware that the act of touch- 
ing an outward object caused a sensation. It was, 
however, at last discovered, that after we have touched 
the object, and before we experience the sensation, 
some change takes place in a kind of thread called a 
nerve, which extends from our outward organs to the 
brain. Touching the object, therefore, is only the 
remote cause of our sensation ; that is, not the cause, 
properly speaking, but the cause of the cause ; — the 
real cause of the sensation is the change in the state 
of the nerve. Future experience may not only give 
us more knowledge than we now have of the particular 
nature of this change, but may also interpolate another 
link : between the contact (for example) of the object 
with our outward organs, and the production of the 
change of state in the nerve, there may take place some 
electric phenomenon. Hitherto, however, no such 
intermediate agency has been discovered; and the 
touch of the object must be considered, provisionally 
at least, as the proximate cause of the afiection of 
the nerve. The sequence, therefore, of a sensation of 
touch upon contact with an object, is ascertained not 
to be an ultimate law ; is resolved, as the phrase is, 
into two other laws, — the law, that contact with an 
object produces an afiection of the nerve; and the 
law, that an afiection of the nerve produces sensa- 
tion. 

To take another example : the more powerful acids

BXPLANATION OF LAWS. 551 

corrode or blacken organic compounds. This is a 
case of causation, but of remote causation ; and is 
said to be explained when it is shown that there is an 
intermediate link, namely, the separation of some of 
the chemical elements of the organic structure from 
the rest, and their entering into combination with the 
acid. The acid causes this separation of the elements, 
and the separation of the elements causes the disorga- 
nization, and often the charring of the structure. So, 
again, chlorine extracts colouring matters (whence its 
efficacy in bleaching), and piuifies the air from infec- 
tion. This law is resolved into the two following 
laws. Chlorine has a powerful affinity for bases of all 
kinds, particularly metallic bases and hydrogen. 
Such bases are essential elements of colouring mat- 
ters and contagious compounds: which substances, 
therefore, are decomposed and destroyed by chlo- 
rine. 

$ 4. It is of importance to remark, that when a 
sequence of phenomena is thus resolved into other 
laws, they are always laws more general than itself. 
The law that A is followed by C, is less general than 
either of the laws which connect B with C and A 
with B. This will appear fixim very simple con- 
siderations. 

All laws of causation are liable to be counteracted, 
or frustrated, by the non-fulfilment of some negative 
condition : the tendency, therefore, of B to produce 
C may be defeated. Now the law that A produces B, 
is equally fulfilled whether B is followed by C or not ; 
but the law that A produces C by means of B, is of 
course only fulfilled when B is really followed by C, 
and is therefore less general than the law that A 
produces B. It is also less general than the law that

552 INDUCTION. 

B produces C. For B may have other causes besides 
A ; and as A produces C only by means of B, while 
B produces C whether it has itself been produced by 
A or by anything else, the second law embraces a 
greater number of instances, covers as it were a 
greater space of ground, than the first 

Thus, in our former example, the law that the 
contact of an object causes a change in the state of 
the nerve, is more general than the law that contact 
with an object causes sensation, since, for aught we 
know, the change in the nerve may equally take place 
when, from a counteracting cause, as for instance 
strong mental excitement, the sensation does not 
follow ; as in a battle, where wounds are often re- 
ceived without any consciousness of receiving them. 
And again, the law that change in the state of a nerve 
produces sensation, is more general than the law that 
contact with an object produces sensation ; since the 
sensation equally follows the change in the nerve when 
not produced by contact with an object, but by some 
other cause ; as in the well-known case, when a 
person who has lost a limb feels the very sensation 
which he has been accustomed to call a pain in the 
limb. 

Not only are the laws of more immediate sequence 
into which the law of a remote sequence is resolved, 
laws of greater generality than that law is, but (as a 
consequence of, or rather as imphed in, their greater 
generality,) they are more to be rehed on ; there are 
fewer chances of their being ultimately found not to 
be universally true. From the moment when the 
sequence of A and C is shown not to be immediate, 
but to depend upon an intervening phenomenon, 
then, however constant and invariable the sequence of 
A and C has hitherto been found, possibilities arise

EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 553 

of its failure, exceeding those which can affect either 
of the more immediate sequences, A B and B C. The 
tendency of A to produce C may be defeated by what- 
ever is capable of defeating either the tendency of A 
to produce B, or the tendency of B to produce C ; it 
is therefore twice as liable to failure as either of those 
more elementary tendencies; and the generalization 
that A is always followed by C, is twice as likely to 
be found erroneous. And so of the converse gene- 
ralisation, that C is always preceded and caused by 
A ; which will be erroneous not only if there should 
happen to be a second immediate mode of production 
of C itself, but moreover if there be a second mode of 
production of B, the immediate antecedent of C in the 
sequence. 

The resolution of the one generalisation into the 
other two, not only shows that there are possible 
limitations of the former, from which its two elements 
are exempt, but shows also where these are to be looked 
for. As soon as we know that B intervenes between 
A and C, we also know that if there be cases in which 
the sequence of A and C does not hold, these are 
most likely to be found by studying the effects and 
the conditions of the phenomenon B. 

It appears, then, that in the second of the three 
modes in which a law may be resolved into other 
laws, the latter are more general, that is, extend to 
more cases, and are also less likely to require limi- 
tation from subsequent experience, thap the law which 
they serve to explain. They are more nearly uncon- 
ditional; they are defeated by fewer contingencies; 
they are a nearer approach to the universal truth of 
nature. The same observations are still more evi- 
dently true with regard to the first of the three modes 
of resolution. When the law of an effect of com-

554 INDUCTION. 

bined causes is resolved into the separate laws of the 
causes, the nature of the case unplies that the law of 
the effect is less general than the law of any of the 
causes, since it only holds when they are combined; 
while the law of any one of the causes holds good 
both then, and also when that cause acts apart from 
the rest. It is also manifest that the complex law is 
liable to be oftener unfulfilled, than any one of the 
simpler laws ef which it is the result, since every con- 
tingency which defeats any of the laws prevents so 
much of the effect as depends upon it, and thereby 
defeats the complex law. The mere rusting, for 
example, of some small part of a great machine, often 
suffices entirely to prevent the effect which ought to 
result from the joint action of all the parts. The 
law of the effect of a combination of causes is always 
subject to the whole of the negative conditions which 
attach to the action of all the causes severally. 

There is another and a still stronger reason why 
the la^f of a complex effect must be less general than 
the laws of the causes which conspire to produce it. 
The same causes, acting according to the same laws, 
and differing only in the proportions in which they 
are combined, often produce effects which differ not 
merely in quantity, but in kind. The combination of 
a tangential with a centripetal force, in the proportions 
which obtain in all the planets and satellites of our 
solar system, gives rise to an elliptical motion ; but if 
the ratio of thQ two forces to each other were slightly 
altered, it is demonstrable that the motion produced 
would be in a circle, or a parabola, or an hyperbola : 
and it has been supposed that in the case of some 
comets one of these is really the fact. Yet the law of 
the parabolic motion would be resolvable into the 
very same simple laws into which that of the elliptical 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 555 

motion is resolved, namely, the law of the permanence 
of rectilineal motion, and the law of an imiform cen- 
tripetal force. If, therefore, in the course of ages, 
some circumstance were to manifest itself which, 
without defeating the law of either of those forces, 
should merely alter their proportion to one another, 
(such as the shock of a comet, or even the accumu- 
lating effect of the resistance of the medium in which 
astronomers have been led to surmise that the motions 
of the heavenly bodies take place); the elliptical 
motion might be changed into a motion in some other 
curve ; and the complex law of the heavenly motions, 
as at present understood, would be deprived of its 
universality, although the discovery would not at all 
detract from the universality of the simpler laws into 
which that complex law is resolved. The law, in 
short, of each of the concurrent causes remains the 
same, however their collocations may vary ; but the 
law of their joint effect varies with every difference in 
the collocations. There needs no more to show how 
much more general the elementary laws must be, than 
any of the complex laws which are derived from them. 

§ 5. Besides the two modes which have been 
treated of, there is a third mode in which laws are 
resolved into one another; and in this it is self- 
evident that they are resolved into laws more general 
than themselves. This third mode is the subsumption 
(as it has been called) of one law under another; 
or (what comes to the same thing) the gathering up 
of several laws into one more general law which 
includes them all. The most splendid example of this 
operation was, when terrestrial gravity and the central 
force of the solar system were brought together

556 INDUCTION. 

under the general law of gravitation. It had been 
proved antecedently that the earth and the other 
planets tended to the sun ; and it had been known 
from the earliest times that all terrestrial bodies tend 
towards the earth. These were similar phenomena ; 
and to enable them both to be subsumed under one 
law, it was only necessary to prove that, as the effects 
were similar in quaUty, so also they, as to quantity, 
conform to the same rules. This was first shown to 
be true of the moon, which agreed -with terrestrial 
objects not only in tending to a centre, but in the 
fact that this centre was the earth. The tendency of 
the moon to the earth was already known to vary as 
the inverse square of the distance; and it was deduced 
from this, by direct calculation, that if the moon were 
as near to the earth as terrestrial objects are, and the 
tangential force were suspended, the moon would fall 
towards the earth through exactly as many feet in a 
second as those objects do by virtue of their weight. 
Hence, the inference was irresistible, that the moon 
also tends to the earth by virtue of its weight : and 
that the two phenomena, the tendency of the moon 
to the earth and the tendency of terrestrial objects to 
the earth, being not only similar in quality, but, 
when under the same circumstances, identical in 
quantity, are cases of one and the same law of causa- 
tion. But the tendency of the moon to the earth and 
the tendency of the earth and planets to the sun, were 
already known to be cases of the same law of causa- 
tion : and thus the law of all these tendencies, and 
the law of terrestrial gravity, were recognised as iden- 
tical, or, in other words, were subsiuned under one 
general law, that of gravitation. 

In a similar manner, the laws of magnetic pheno-

EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 557 

mena have recently been subsumed under known 
laws of electricity. It is thus that the most general 
laws of nature are usually arrived at : we mount to 
them by successive steps. For, to arrive by correct 
induction at laws which hold under such an immense 
variety of circumstances, laws so general as to be 
independent of any varieties of space or time which 
we are able to observe, requires for the most part 
many distinct sets of experiments or observations, 
conducted at different times and by different people. 
One part of the law is first ascertained, afterwards 
another part : one set of observations teaches us that 
the law holds good under some conditions, another 
that it holds good under other conditions, by com- 
bining which observations we find that it holds 
good under conditions much more general, or even 
universally. The general law, in this case, is literally 
the sum of all the partial ones ; it is the recognition 
of the same sequence in different sets of instances ; 
and may, in fact, be regarded as merely one step in 
the process of elimination. That tendency of bodies 
towards one another, which we now call gravity, had 
at first been observed only upon the earth's surface, 
where it manifested itself only as a tendency of all 
bodies towards the earth, and might, therefore, be 
ascribed to a peculiar property of the earth itself: one 
of the circumstances, namely, the proximity of the 
earth, had not been eliminated. To eliminate this 
circumstance required a fresh set of instances in other 
parts of the universe : these we could not ourselves 
create ; and though nature had created them for us, 
we were placed in very unfavourable circumstances 
for observing them. To make these observations, fell 
naturally to the lot of a different set of persons from 
those who studied terrestrial phenomena, and had.

indeed, been a matter of great interest at a time when 
the idea of explaining celestial facts by terrestrial 
laws, was looked upon as the confounding of an 
indefeasible distinction. When, however, the celes- 
tial motions were accurately ascertained, and the 
deductive processes performed from which it appeared 
that their laws and those of terrestrial gravity corre- 
sponded, those celestial observations became a set of 
instances which exactly eliminated the circumstance 
of proximity to the earth ; and proved that in the 
original case^ that of terrestrial objects, it was not the 
earth, as such, that caused the motion or the pressure, 
but the circumstance common to that case with the 
celestial instances, namely, the presence of some great 
body within certain limits of distance. 

§ 6. There are, then, three modes of explaining 
laws of causation, or, which is the same thing, 
resolving them into other laws. First, when the law 
of an effect of comlnned causes is resolved into the 
separate laws of the causes, together with the fSetct of 
their combination. Secondly, when the law which 
connects any two links, not proximate, in a chain of 
causation, is resolved into the laws which connect each 
with the intermediate links. Both of these are cases 
of resolving one law into two or more ; in the third, 
two or more are resolved into one : when, after the 
law has been shown to hold good in several different 
classes of cases, we decide that what is true in each 
of these classes of cases, is true under some more 
general supposition, consisting of what all those 
classes of cases have in common. We may here 
remark that this last operation involves none of the 
uncertainties attendant upon induction by the Method 
of Agreement, since we need not suppose the result

EXPLANATION OP LAWS. 659 

to be extended by way of inference to any new class 
of cases; different from those by the comparison of 
which it was engendered. 

In all these three processes, laws are, as we have 
seen, resolved into laws more general than themselves, 
laws extending to all the cases which the former 
extend to, and others besides. In the first two modes 
they are also resolved into laws more certain, in other 
words, more universally true than themselves ; they 
are, in fact, proved not to be themselves laws of 
nature, the character of which is to be universally 
true, but results of laws of nature, which may be only 
true conditionally, and for the most part. No diflFer- 
ence of this sort exists in the third case ; since here 
the partial laws are, in fact, the very same law as 
the general one, and any exception to them would be 
an exception to it too. 

By all the three processes, the range of deductive 
science is extended; since the laws, thus resolved, 
may be thenceforth deduced demonstratively from 
the laws into which they are resolved. As already 
remarked, the same deductive process which proves a 
law or fact of causation, if unknown, serves to explain 
it when known. 

The word explanation is here used in a somewhat 
peculiar sense. ' What is called explaining one law of 
nature by another, is but substituting one mystery for 
another; and does nothing to render the general 
course of nature other than mysterious : we can no 
more assign a why for the more extensive laws than 
for the partial ones. The explanation may substitute 
a mystery which has become familiar, and has grown 
to seem not mysterious, for one which is still strange. 
And this is the meaning of explanation, in common

parlance. But the process with which we are here 
concerned often does the very contrary; it resolves a 
phenomenon with which we are familiar, into one of 
which we previously knew little or nothing ; as when 
the common fact of the fall of heavy bodies is 
resolved into a tendency of all particles of matter 
towards one another. It must be kept constantly in 
view, therefore, that when philosophers speak of 
explaining any of the phenomena of nature, they 
always mean, pointing out not some more familiar 
but merely some more general phenomenon of which 
it is a partial exemplification, or some laws of causa- 
tion which produce it by their joint or successive 
action, and from which, therefore, its conditions may 
be determined deductively. Every such operation 
brings us a step nearer towards answering the ques- 
tion, which was stated some time ago as compre- 
hending the whole problem of the investigation of 
nature, viz., What are the fewest assumptions which 
being granted, the order of nature as it exists would 
be the result ? What are the fewest general proposi- 
tions from which all the uniformities existing in 
nature could be deduced? 

The laws, thus explained or resolved, are some- 
times said to be accounted for; but the expression is 
incorrect, if taken to mean anything more than what 
has been already stated. In minds not habituated to 
accurate thinking, there is often a confused notion 
that the general laws are the causes of the partial 
ones; that the law of general gravitation, for example, 
causes the phenomenon of the fall of bodies to the 
earth. But to assert this,' would be a misuse of the 
word cause: terrestrial gravity is not an eflFect of 
general gravitation, but a case of it ; that is, one kind

of the particular instances in which that general law 
obtains. To account for a law of nature means, and 
can mean^ no more than to assign other laws more 
general, together with collocations, which laws and 
collocations being supposed, the partial law follows 
without any additions^ supposition.

MISCELLANEOUS EXAMPLES OP THE EXPLANATION 
OF LAWS OF NATURE. 

$ L Some of the most remarkable instances which 
have occurred since the great Newtonian generaliza- 
tion, of the explanation of laws of causation subsist- 
ing among complex phenomena, by resolving them 
into simpler and more general laws, are to be found 
among the recent speculations of liebig in organic 
chemistry. These speculations, although they have 
not yet been sitfficiently long before the world to 
entitle us positively to assume that no well-grounded 
objection can be made to any part of them, afford, 
however, so admirable an example of the spirit of the 
Deductive Method, that I may be permitted to present 
some specimens of them here. 

It had been observed in certain cases, that chemical 
action is, as it were, contagious; that is to say, a 
substance which would not of itself yield to a parti- 
cular chemical attraction (the force of the attraction 
not being sufficient to overcome cohesion, or to 
destroy some chemical combination in which the 
substance was already held), will nevertheless do so 
if placed in contact with some other body which is in 
the act of yielding to the same force. Nitric acid, for 
example, does not dissolve pure platinum, which may 
*' be boiled with this acid without being oxidized by 
it, even when in a state of such fine division that it 
no longer reflects Ught/' But the same acid easily 
dissolves silver. Now if an alloy of silver and plati-

EXAMPLES OF THE EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 563' 

num be treated with nitric acid, the add does not, as 
might naturally be expected, separate the two metals, 
dissolving the silver, and leaving the platinum; it 
dissolves both: the platinum as well as the silver 
becomes oxidized, and in that state combines with the 
undecomposed portion of the acid. In like manner, 
^' copper does not decompose water, even when boiled 
in dilute sulphuric add, but an alloy of copper, zinc, 
and nickel^ dissolves easily in this acid with evolution 
of hydrogen gas/* These phenomena cannot be 
explained by the laws of what is termed chemical 
affinity. They point to a peculiar law, by which the 
oxidatioa which one body suffers, causes another, in 
contact with it, to submit to the same diange. And 
not only chemical composition, but chemical decom^ 
position, is capable of being similarly propagated. The 
peroxide of hydrogen, a compound formed by hydrogen 
with a greater amount of oxygen than the quantity 
necessary to form water, is held together by a chemical 
attraction of so weak a nature, that the lightest eir- 
cumstance is sufficient to decompose it ; and it even, 
though very slowly, gives off oxygen and is reduced 
to water spontaneously (being, I presume, decom- 
posed by the tendency of its oxygen to absorb heat 
and assume the gaseous state). Now it has been 
observed, that if this decomposition of the peroxidiei 
of hydrogen takes place in contact with some metallic 
Oxides^ as those of silver, and the peroxides of lead 
dud manganese, it superinduces a corresponding che-^ 
mical action upon those substances; they also give 
forth the whole or a portion of their oxygen, and are 
reduced to the metal or to the protoxide; although they 
do not undergo this change spontiCneously, and there 
is no chemical affinity at work to make them do so. 
Other similar phenomena are mentioned by Dr. liebig.

" Now no other expiration/' he observes, ** of these: 
phenomena can be given^ than that a body in the act 
of combination or decomposition enables another body» 
with which it is in contact, to enter into the same 
state/' 

Here, 'therefore, is a law of nature of great sim- 
phcity, but which, owing to the extremely special and 
Umited character of the phenomena in which alone 
it can be detected experimentally (because in them 
alone its results are not intermixed and blended with 
those of other laws), had been very Uttle recognised 
by chemists, and no one could have ventured, on expe- 
rimental evidence, to affirm it as a law common to all 
chemical action; owing to the impossibility of a rigo- 
rous employment of the Method of Difference where 
the properties of difierent kinds of substance are 
involved^ an impossibility which we noticed and cha- 
racterised in a previous chapter*. Now this extremely 
special and apparently precarious generalization has, 
in the hands of Liebig, been converted, by a masterly 
employment of the Deductive Method, into a law 
pervading all nature, in the same way as gravitation 
assumed that character in the hands of Newton ; and 
has been found to explain, in the most unexpected 
manner, numerous detached generalizations of a more 
hmited kind, reducing the phenomena concerned in 
those generalizations into mere cases of itself. 

The contagious influence of chemical action is not a 
powerful force, and is only capable of overcoming weak 
affinities : we may, therefore, expect to find it prin- 
cipally exemplified in the decomposition of substances 
which are held together by weak chemical forces. 
Now the force which holds a compound substance

together is. generally weaker, the more'eompoiuid Ihe 
substance is; and organic products are the most coni^ 
pound substances known, those which have the most 
complex atomic constitution. It is, therefore, upon 
such substances that the self-propagating power of 
chemical action is Ukely to exert itself in the most 
marked manner. Accordingly, first, it explains the 
remarkable laws of fermentation, and some of those 
of putrefaction. '* A little leaven,** that is, dough in 
a certain state of chemical action, impresses a similar 
chemical action upon '' the whole lump." The con- 
tact of any decaying substance^ occasions the decay of 
matter previously sound. Again, yeast is a substance 
actually in a process of decomposition from the action 
of air and water, evolving carbonic acid gas. Sugar 
is a substance which, from the complexity of its com^^ 
position, has no great energy of coherence in its exist* 
ing form, and is capable of being easily converted (by 
combination with the elements of water) into carbonic 
acid and alcol^oL Now the mere presence of yeast, 
the mere proximity of a substance of which the ele* 
ments are separating from each other, and com^ 
bining with the elements of water, causes sugar to 
undergo the same change, giving out carbonic acid 
gas, and becoming alcohol. It is not the elements, 
contained in the yeast which do this. '' An aqueoua 
infusion of yeast may be mixed with a solution of 
sugar, and preserved in vessels from which the air is. 
excluded, without either experiencing the slightest 
change/' Neither does the insoluble residue of the 
yeast, after being treated with water, possess the 
power of exciting fermentation. It is not the yeast 
itself, therefore ; it is the yeast in a state of decom<» 
position. The sugar, which would not decompose and 
oxidize by the mere presence of oxygen and water.

18 induoed to do so when another oxidation is at wcH-k 
in the midst of iL 

By the same principle liebig is enabled to expfadn 
malaria ; the pernicious influence of putrid substances ; 
a variety of poisons; contagious diseases; and other 
phenomena. Of all substances, those composing the 
animal body are the most complex in their compost* 
tion, and in the least stable condition of union. The 
bloody in particular^ is the most imstable compound 
known. What, therefore, can be less surprising than 
that gaseous or other substances, in the act o{ under* 
going the chemical changes which constitute, for 
instance^ putrefioiction, e^ould, when brought into 
ocmtact with the tissues by respiration or otherwise, 
and still more when introduced by inoculation into 
the blood itself, impress upon some of the particles a 
chemical action similar to its own ; which is propa- 
gated in like manner to other particles, until the whole 
system is placed in a state of chemical action m<N:e 
or less inconsistent with the diemical conditions of 
vitality. 

Of the three modes in which we observed in the 
last chiqpter that the resolution of a special law into 
more general ones may take place, this speculation of 
liebig exemplifies the second. The laws expkuned 
are such as this, that yeast puts sugar into a state of 
fermentaticm. Between the remote cause, the pre- 
sence of yeast, and the consequent fermentation of 
the sugar, there has been interpolated a proximate 
cause, the chemical action between the particles of the 
yeast and the elements of air and water. The special 
law is thus resolved into two others, more g^ieral 
than itself: the first, that yeast is deounposed by the 
presence of air and water ; the second, that matter 
undergoiog chemical action has a tendency to produce

similar chemical action in other matter in contact 
with it. But while the investigation thus aptly 
exhibits the second mode of the resolution of a com- 
plex law, it no less happily exemplifies the third; the 
subsumption of special laws under a more general 
law, by gathering them up into one more comprehen* 
sive expression which includes them all. For the 
curious fact of the contagious nature of chemical 
action was only raised into a law of all chemical action 
by these very investigations ; just as the Newtonian 
attraction was only recognised as a law of all matter 
when it was found to explain the phenomena of terres- 
trial gravity. Previously to liebig's investigations, 
the property in question had only been observed in a 
few special cases of chemical action; but when his 
deductive reasonings had established that innumerable 
efiects produced upon weak compounds, by substances 
none of whose known peculiarities would account for 
their having such a power, might be explained by con- 
sidering the supposed special property to exist in all 
those cases, these numerous generalizations on sepa* 
rate substances were brought together into one law of 
chemical action in general: the peculiarities of the 
various substances being, in fact, eliminated, just as 
the Newtonian deduction eliminated from the in- 
stances of terrestrial gravity the circumstance of 
proximity to the earth. 

$ 2. Another of Liebig's speculations, which, if it 
should ultimately be foimd to agree with all the facts 
of the extremely complicated phenomenon to which it 
relates, will constitute one of the finest Examples of 
the Deductive Method upon record, is his theory of 
respiration. 

The facts of respiration, or in other words the

special laws which Liebig has attempted to explaih 
from, and resolve into, more general ones, sure, that 
the blood in passing through the lungs absorbs oxy- 
gen and gives out carbonic acid gas, changing thereby 
its colour from a blackish purple to a brilliant red. 
The absorption and exhalation are evidently chemical 
phenomena; and the carbon of the carbonic acid must 
have been derived from the body, that is, must have 
been absorbed by the blood from the substances with 
which it came into contact in its passage through the 
organism. Required to find the intermediate links, 
the precise nature of the two chemical actions which 
take place ; first, the absorption of the carbon or of 
the carbonic acid by the blood, in its circulation 
through the body; next, the excretion of the carbon, 
or the exchange of the carbonic acid for oxygen, in its 
passage through the lungs. 

Dr. Liebig believes himself to have found the 
solution of this vexata qtujsstio in a class of chemical 
actions in which scarcely any less acute and accurate 
inquirer would have thought of looking for it. 

Blood is composed of two parts, the serum and 
the globules. The serum absorbs and holds in solu«« 
tion carbonic acid in great quantity, but has no 
tendency either to part with it or to absorb oxygen. 
The globules, therefore, are concluded to be the por- 
tion of the blood which is operative in respiration. 
These globules contain a certain quantity of iron, 
which from chemical tests is inferred to be in the state 
of oxide. 

Dr. Liebig recognised, in the known chemical 
properties of the oxides of iron, laws which, if fol-* 
lowed out deductively, would lead to the prediction 
of the precise series of phenomena which respiration 
exhibits.

BXAMPLES OF THE EXPLANATION OF LAWS. 569 

There are two oxides of iron, a protoxide and a 
peroxide. In the arterial blood the iron is in the 
form of peroxide : in the venous blood we have no 
direct evidence which of the oxides is present, but 
the considerations to be presently stated will prove 
that it is the protoxide. As arterial and venous 
blood are in a perpetual state of alternate conver- 
sion into one another, the question arises, under 
what circumstances the protoxide of iron is capable of 
being converted into the peroxide, and vice versd. 
Now the protoxide readily combines with oxygen in 
the presence of water, forming the hydrated peroxide : 
these conditions it finds in passing through the lungs; 
it derives oxygen from the air, and finds water in the 
blood itself. This would already explain one portion 
of the phenomena of respiration. But the arterial 
blood, in quitting the lungs, is charged with hydrated 
peroxide: in what manner is the peroxide brought 
back to its former state ? 

The chemical conditions for the reduction of the 
hydrated peroxide into the slate of protoxide, are 
precisely those which the blood meets with in circu- 
lating through the body; namely, contact with organic 
compounds. 

Hydrated peroxide of iron, when treated with 
organic compounds (where no sulphur is present) gives 
forth oxygen and water, which oxygen, attracting the 
carbon from the organic substance, becomes carbonic 
acid ; while the peroxide, being reduced to the state 
of protoxide, combines with the carbonic acid, and 
becomes a carbonate. Now this carbonate needs only 
come again into contact with oxygen and water to be 
decomposed ; the carbonic acid being given off, and 
the protoxide, by the absorption of oxygen and water, 
becoming again the hydmted peroxide*

570 INDUCTION. 

The mysterious chemical phenomena connected 
with respiration can now, by a beautiful deductive 
process, be completely explained. The arterial blood, 
containing iron in the form of hydrated peroxide, 
passes into the capillaries, where it meets with the 
decaying tissues, receiving also in its course certain 
non-azotised but highly carbonised animal products, 
in particular the bile. In these it finds the precise 
conditions required for decomposing the peroxide into 
oxygen and the protoxide. The oxygen combines 
with the carbon of the decaying tissues, and forms 
carbonic acid, which, although insufficient in amount 
to neutralize the whole of the protoxide, combines 
with a portion (one-fourth) of it, and returns in the 
form of a carbonate, along with the other three- 
fourths of the protoxide, through the venous system 
into the lungs. There it again meets with oxygen and 
water: the free protoxide becomes hydrated peroxide; 
the carbonate of protoxide parts with its carbonic acid, 
and by absorbing oxygen and water, enters also into 
the state of hydrated peroxide. The heat evolved in 
the transition from protoxide to peroxide, as well as 
in the previous oxidation of the carbon contained 
in the tissues, is considered byLiebig as the cause 
which sustains the temperature of the body. But 
into this portion of the speculation we need not 
enter*. 



* As corroborating the opinion of Liebig that the protoxide of 
iron in the venous blood is only partially carbonated, the fact has 
been suggested, that the system shows great readiness to absorb an 
extra quantity of carbonic acid, as furnished in effervescing drinks. 
In such cases the acid must combine with something, and that 
something is probably the free protoxide. It would be worth 
ascerttuning whether the protoxide itself or its carbonate has the 
greater facility in abstM-bing oxygen and turning itself into hydrated

This example displays the second mode of resolving 
complex laws, by the interpolation of intermediate 
links in the chain of causation ; and some of the steps 
of the deduction exhibit cases of the first mode, that 
which infers the joint effect of two or more causes 
from their separate effects ; but to trace out in detail 
these exemplifications may be left to the intelligence 
of the reader. The third mode is not employed in 
this example, since the simpler laws into which those 
of respiration are resolved (the laws of the chemical 
action of the oxides of iron) were already known laws, 
and did not acquire any additional generality from 
their employment in the present case. 

$ 3. The property which salt possesses of pre- 
serving animal substances from putrefaction is re- 
solved by Liebig into two more general laws, the 
strong attraction of salt for water, and the necessity 
of the presence of water as a condition of putrefaction* 
The intermediate phenomenon which is interpolated 
between the remote cause and the effect, can here be 
not merely inferred but seen ; for it is a familiar fact, 
that flesh upon which salt has been thrown is speedily 
found swimming in brine. 

The second of the two factors (as they may be 
termed) into which the preceding law has been 
resolved, the necessity of water to putrefaction, itself 
affords an additional example of the Resolution of 
Laws. The law itself is proved by the Method of 



peioxide in the lungs. If the carbonate, then the beneficial effect, 
on the animal economy, of drinks which giro an artificial supply of 
carbonic acid to the system, would be, to that extent, deductively 
demonstrated.

Difference ) since flesh completely dried and kept in a 
dry atmosphere does not putrefy, as we see in the case 
of dried provisions, and human bodies in very dry 
climates. A deductive explanation of this same law 
results from liebig's speculations. The putrefaction 
of animal and other azotised bodies is a chemical 
process, by which they are gradually dissipated in a 
gaseous form, chiefly in that of carbonic acid and 
ammonia ; now to convert the carbon of the animal 
substance into carbonic acid requires oxygen, and to 
convert the azote into ammonia requires hydrc^en, 
which are the elements of water. The extreme rapidity 
of the putrefaction of azotised substances, compared 
with the gradual decay of non-azotised bodies (such 
as wood and the like) by the action of oxygen alone, 
is explained by Liebig from the general law that 
substances are much more easily decomposed by the 
action of two different affinities upon two of their 
elements, than by the action of only one. 

The purgative effect of salts with alkaline bases, 
when administered in concentrated solutions, is 
explained by Liebig from the two following principles : 
Animal tissues (such as the stomach) do not absorb 
concentrated solutions of alkaline salts ; and such 
solutions do dissolve the solids contained in the intes- 
tines. The simpler laws into which the complex law 
is here resolved, are the second of the two foregoing • 
principles combined with a third, namely, that the 
peristaltic contraction acts easily upon substances in a 
state of solution. The negative general proposition, 
that animal substances do not absorb these salts, con- 
tributes to the explanation by accoimting for the 
absence of a counteracting cause, namely, absorp- 
tion by the stomach, which in the case of other

substances possessed of the requisite chemical proper- 
ties, interferes to prevent them from reaching the 
substances which they are destined to dissolve. 

§ 4. From the foregoing and similar instances, we 
may see the importance, when a law of nature pre- 
viously unknown has been brought to light, or when 
uew light has been thrown upon a known law by 
experiment, of examining all cases which present the 
conditions necessary for bringing that law into action ; 
a process necessarily fertile in demonstrations of spe- 
cial laws previously unsuspected, and explanations of 
others already empirically known. 

For instance, Faraday discovered by experiment^ 
that voltaic electricity could be evolved from a natural 
magnet, provided a coiiducting body were set in motion 
at right angles to the direction of the magnet ; and, 
this he found to hold not only of small magnets, but 
of that great magnet, the earth. The law being thus 
established experimentally, that electricity is evolved, 
by a magnet, and a conductor moving at right angles 
to the direction of its poles, we may now look out for 
fresh instances in which these conditions meet* 
Wherever a conductor moves or revolves at right 
angles to the direction of the earth's magnetic poles, 
there we may expect an evolution of electricity. la 
the northern regions, where the polar direction is 
nearly perpendicular to the horizon, all horizontal 
motions of conductors will produce electricity: hori- 
zontal wheels, for example, made of metal ; likewise 
all running streams will evolve a current of electricity 
which will circulate round them ; and the air thus 
charged with electricity may be one of the causes of 
the Aurora Borealis. In the equatorial regions, on 
the contrary, upright wheels placed parallel to the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC 



574 INDUCTION, 

equator will originate a voltaic circuit, and waterMk 
will naturally become electric. 

For a second example ; it has recently been found, 
chiefly by the researches of Professor Graham, that 
gases have a strong tendency to permeate animal 
membranes^ and diffuse themselves through the 
spaces which such membranes inclose, notwithstand- 
ing the presence of other gases in those spaces. 
Proceeding from this general law, and reviewing a 
variety of cases in which gases lie contiguous to 
memlnranes, we are enabled to demonstrate or to ex- 
plain the following more special laws : 1st The human 
or animal body, when surrounded with any gas not 
already contained within the body, absorbs it rapidly; 
such, for instance, as the gases of putrefying matters: 
which helps to explain malaria. 2Dd. Hie carbonic 
acid gas of effervescing drinks, evc^ved in the sto- 
mach, permeates its membranes, and rapidly spreads 
through the system, where, as suggested in a former 
note, it probably comlnnes with the iron contained in 
the blood. Srd. Alcohol taken ipto the stomach (the 
temperature of the stomach is above the boiling-point 
of pure alcohol,) passes into vapour and spreads 
through the system with great rapidity ; (which com- 
bined with the high combustibility of alcohol, or in 
other words its ready combination with oxygen, may 
perhaps help to explain the bodily warmth immediately 
consequent on drinking sjHrituous liquors.) 4th. In any 
state of the body in which peculiar gases are formed 
within it, these will rapidly exhale through all parts 
of the body ; and hence the rapidity with which, in 
certain states of disease, the surrounding atmosphere 
becomes tainted. 5th. The putrefaction of the inte- 
rior parts of a carcase will proceed as rapidly as that 
of the exterior, from the ready passage outwards of

the gaseous products. 6. The exchange of oxygen and 
carbonic acid in the lungs is not prevented, but rather 
promoted, by the intervention of the membrane of the 
lungs and the coats of the blood vessels between the 
blood and the air. It is necessary, however, that 
there should be a substance in the blood with which 
the oxygen of the air may immediately combine, 
otherwise, instead of passing inte the blood, it would 
permeate the whole organism; and it is necessary 
that the carbonic acid, as it is formed in the capil- 
laries, should also find a substance in the blood with 
which it can combine; otherwise it would leave the 
body at all points, instead of being discharged through 
the lungs. 

§ 5. The following is a deduction which confirms, 
by explaining, the old but not undisputed empirical 
generalization that soda powders weaken the human 
system. These powders, consisting of a mixture of 
tartaric acid with bicarbonate of soda, from which the 
carbonic acid is set free, must pass into the stomach 
as tartrate of soda. Now, neutral tartrates, citrates^ 
and acetates of the alkalis are found, in their passage 
through the S3rstem, to be changed into carbonates ; 
and to convert a tartrate into a carbonate requires an 
additional quantity of oxygen, the abstraction of which 
must lessen the oxygen destined for assimilation with 
the blood, and to the quantity of which the vigorous 
action of the human system is proportional. 

The instances of new theories agreeing with and 
explaining old empiricisms, are innumerable. All the 
just remarks made by experienced persons on human 
character and conduct, are so many special laws, which 
the general laws of the human mind explain and 
resolve. The empirical generalizations on which the 

Digitized by VjOOQ iC

operations of the arts have usually been founded, are 
continually justified and confirmed on the one hand, 
or rectified and improved on the other, by the disco- 
very of the simpler scientific laws on which the 
eflScacy of those operations depends. The efiTects of 
the rotation of crops, of the various manures, and the 
other processes of improved agriculture, have been, 
for the first time, resolved in our own day into known 
laws of chemical and organic action, by Davy and 
Liebig. The processes of the healing art are even now 
mostly empirical ; their efficacy is concluded, in each in^ 
stance, from a special and most precarious experimental 
generalization : but as science advances in discovering 
the simple laws of chemistry and physiology, progress is 
made in ascertaining the intermediate links in the series 
pf phenomena, and the more general laws on which they 
depend : and thus, while the old processes are either 
exploded, or their efficacy, in so far ad real, explained, 
improved processes, founded on the knowledge of 
proximate causes, are continually suggested and 
brought into use*. Many even of the truths of 
geometry were generalizations from experience before 
they were deduced from first principles. The quadra*^ 
ture of the cycloid was first efiected by measurement. 



* It was an old generalization in surgery, that tight bandaging 
had a tendency to prevent or dissipate local inflammations. This se- 
quence being, in the progress of physiolo^al knowledge, resolved into 
more general laws, led to the important surgical invention reoentlj 
made by Dr. Amott, the treatment of local inflammation and 
tumours by means of an equable pressure, produced by a bladder par- 
tially filled with air. The pressure, by keeping back the blood front 
the part, prevents the inflammation, or the tumour, from being 
nourished ; in the case of inflammation, it removes the stimulus, which 
the organ is unfit to receive : in the case of tumours, by keeping back 
the nutritive fluid it causes the absorption of matter to exceed the 
supply, and the diseased mass is gradually absorbed and disappears*

or rather by weighing a cycloidai card, and comparing 
its weight with that of a piece of sunilar card of known 
dimensions. 

$ 6. To the foregoing examples from physical science, 
let us add another from mental. The following is one 
of the simple laws of mind : Ideas of a pleasurable 
or painful character form associations more easily and 
strongly than other ideas, that is, they become asso- 
ciated after fewer repetitions, and the association is 
more durable. This is an experimental law, grounded 
upon the Method of Difference. By deduction from 
this law, many of the more special laws which experi- 
ence shows to exist among particular mental pheno- 
mena may be demonstrated and explained : — the ease 
and rapidity, for instance, with which thoughts con- 
nected with our passions or our more cherished 
interests are excited, and the firm hold which the 
facts relating to them have on our memory; the 
vivid recollection we retain of minute circumstances 
which accompanied any object or event that deeply 
interested us, and of the times and places in which we 
have been very happy or very miserable ; the horror 
with which we view the accidental instrument of any 
occurrence which shocked us, or the locaUty where it 
took place, and the pleasure we derive from any 
memorial of past enjoyment ; all these effects being 
proportional to the sensibiUty of the individual mind, 
and to the consequent intensity of the pain or pleasure 
from which the association originated. It has been 
suggested by the able writer of a biographical sketch 
of Dr. Priestley, in one of our monthly periodicals, 
that the same elementary law of our mental consti- 
tution, suitably followed out, would explain a variety

of mental phenomena hitherto inexplicable, and in 
particular some of the fundamental diversities of human 
character and genius. Our associations being of two 
sorts, either betwpen synchronous, or between suc- 
cessive impressions; and the influence of the law 
which renders associations stronger in proportion to 
the pleasurable or painful character of the impressions, 
being felt with peculiar force in the synchronous class 
of associations; it is remarked by the writer referred 
to, that in minds of strong organic sensibility syn- 
chronous associations will be likely to predominate, 
producing a tendency to conceive things in pictures 
and in the concrete, clothed in all their attributes and 
circumstances, a mental habit which is commonly 
called Imagination, and is one of the peculiarities of 
the painter and the poet; while persons of more mode- 
rate susceptibility to pleasure and pain will have a 
tendency to associate facts chiefly in the order of their 
succession, and if they possess mental superiority, will 
addict themselves to history or science rather than to 
creative art. This interesting speculation the author 
of the present work has endeavoured, on another 
occasion, to pursue farther, and to explain, by means 
of it, the leading peculiarities of the poetical tem- 
perament. It is at least an example which may 
serve, instead of many others, to show the extensive 
scope which exists for deductive investigation in the 
important and so eminently imperfect Science of 
Mind. 

§ 7. The copiousness with which I have exempli- 
fied the discovery and explanation of special laws of 
phenomena by deduction from simpler and more general 
ones, was prompted by a desire to characterise clearly,

and place in its due position of importance, the De- 
ductive Method ; which in the present state of know- 
ledge is destined irrevocably to predominate in the 
course of scientific investigation from this time forward. 
A revolution is peaceably and progressively effecting 
itself in philosophy, the reverse of that to which 
Bacon has attached his name. That great man 
changed the method of the sciences from deductive to 
experimental, and it is now rapidly reverting from 
experimental to deductive. But the deductions 
which Bacon abolished were from premisses hastily 
snatched up, or arbitrarily assumed. The principles 
were neither established by legitimate canons of expe- 
rimental inquiry, nor the results tested by that indis- 
pensable element of a rational Deductive Method, 
verification by specific experience. Between the 
primitive Method of Deduction and that which I have 
attempted to define, there is all the difference which 
exists between the Aristotelian physics and the New- 
tonian theory of the heavens. 

That the advances henceforth to be expected even 
in physical, and still more in mental and social science, 
will be chiefly the result of deduction, is evident from 
the general considerations already adduced. Among 
subjects really accessible to our faculties, those which 
still remain in a state of dimness and uncertainty (the 
succession of their phenomena not having yet been 
brought under fixed and recognisable laws) are mostly 
those of a very complex character, in which many 
agents are at work together, and their effects in a 
constant state of blending and intermixture. The 
disentangling of these crossing threads is a task 
attended with difficulties which, as we have already 
shown, are susceptible of solution by the instrument of

deduction alone. Deduction is the great scientitic 
work of the present and of future ages. The portion 
henceforth reserved for specific experience in the 
achievements of science, is mainly that of suggesting 
hints to be followed up by the deductive inquirer, and 
of confirming or checking his conclusions.
