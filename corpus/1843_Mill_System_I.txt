preface 



this book makes no pretence of giving to the 
world a new theory of our intellectual operations 
its claim to attention if it possess any is grounded 
on the fact that it is an attempt not to supersede but 
to embody and systematize the best ideas which have 
been either promulgated on its subject by speculative 
writers or conformed to by accurate thinkers in their 
scientific inquiries 

to cement together the detached fragments of a 
subject never yet treated as a whole to harmonize 
the true portions of discordant theories by supplying 
the links of thought necessary to connect them and by 
disentangling them from the errors with which they 
are always more or less interwoven must necessarily 
require a considerable amount of original speculation 
to other originality than this the present work lays 
no claim in the existing state of the cultivation of 
the sciences there would be a very strong presumption 
against any one who should imagine that he had 
effected a revolution in the theory of the investi 
gation of truth or added any fundamentally new 
process to the practice of it the improvement which 
remains to be effected in methods of philosophiz 
ing and the author believes that they have much

need of improvement can only consist in performing 
more systematically and accurately operations with 
which at least in their elementary form the human 
intellect m some one or other of its employments is 
already familiar 

in the portion of the work which treats of ratio 
cination the author has not deemed it necessary to 
enter into technical details which may he obtained in 
so perfect a shape from the existing treatises on what 
is termed the logic of the schools in the contempt 
entertained by many modern philosophers for the 
syllogistic art it will be seen that he by no means 
participates although the scientific theory on which 
its defence is usually rested appears to him erro 
neous and the view which he has suggested of the 
nature and functions of the syllogism may perhaps 
afford the means of conciliating the principles of the 
art with as much as is wellgrounded in the doctrines 
and objections of its assailants 

the same abstinence from details could not be 
observed in the first book on names and proposi 
tions because many useful principles and distinctions 
which were contained in the old logic have been 
gradually omitted from the writings of its later 
teachers and it appeared desirable both to revive 
these and to reform and rationalize the philosophical 
foundation on which they stood the earlier chapters 
of this preliminary book will consequently appear to 
some readers needlessly elementary and scholastic 
but those who know in what darkness the nature of 
our knowledge and of the processes by which it is

obtained is often involved by a confused apprehension 
of the import of the diflferent classes of words and 
assertions will not regard these discussions as either 
frivolous or irrelevant to the topics considered in the 
later books 

on the subject of induction the task to be 
performed was that of generalizing the modes of in 
vestigating truth and estimating evidence by which 
so many important and recondite laws of nature have 
in the various sciences been aggregated to the stock 
of human knowledge that this is not a task free 
from difficulty may be presumed from the fact that 
even at a very recent period eminent writers among 
whom it is sufficient to name archbishop whately 
and the author of a celebrated article on bacon in 
the edinburgh review have not scrupled to pronounce 
it impossible the author has endeavoured to combat 
their theory in the manner in which diogenes con 
futed the sceptical reasonings against the possibility 
of motion remembering that diogenes argument 
would have been equally conclusive although his 
individual perambulations might not have extended 
beyond the circuit of his own tub 

whatever may be the value of what the author has 
succeeded in effecting on this branch of his subject 
it is a duty to acknowledge that for much of it 
he has been indebted to several important trea 
tises partly historical and partly philosophical on 
the generalities and processes of physical science 
which have been published within the last few years 
to these treatises and to their authors he has endea

voured to do full justice in the body of the work 
but as with one of these writers mr whewell he 
has occasion frequently to express differences of 
opinion it is more particularly incumbent on him in 
this place to declare that without the aid derived 
from the facts and ideas contained in that gentlemans 
history of the inductive sciences the corresponding 
portion of this work would probably not have been 
written 

the concluding book is an attempt to contribute 
towards the solution of a question which the decay of 
old opinions and the agitation that disturbs euro 
pean society to its inmost depths render as important 
in the present day to the practical interests of human 
life as it must at all times be to the completeness of 
our speculative knowledge viz whether moral and 
social phenomena are really exceptions to the general 
certainty and uniformity of the course of nature and 
how far the methods by which so many of the laws 
of the physical world have been numbered among 
truths irrevocably acquired and universally assented 
to can be made instrumental to the gradual formation 
of a similar body of received doctrine in moral and 
political science 

while the views promulgated in these volumes 
still await the verdict of competent judges it would 
have been useless to attempt to make the exposition 
of them so elementary as to be suited to readers 
wholly unacquainted with the subject it can scarcely 
be hoped that the second book will be throughout 
intelligible to any one who has not gone carefully

introduction 



§ therb is as great diversity among authors in 
the modes which they have adopted of defining logic 
as in their treatment of the details of it this is 
vfhnt might naturauy he expected on any subject on 
which writers have availed themselves of the same 
language as a means of delivering different ideas 
ethics and jurisprudence are liable to the remark 
in common with logic almost every philosopher 
having taken a different view of some of the par 
ticulars which these branches of knowledge are usually 
understood to include each has so framed his defi 
nition as to indicate beforehand his own peculiar 
tenets and sometimes to beg the question in their 
favour 

this diversity is not so much an evil to be com 
plained of as an inevitable and in some degree a 
proper result of the imperfect state of those sciences 
there cannot be agreement about the definition of a 
thing until there is agreement about the thing itself 
to define a thing is to select from among the whole 
of its properties those which shall be understood to 
be designated and declared by its name and the 
properties must be very well known to us before we 
can be competent to determine which of them are 
fittest to be chosen for this purpose accordingly in 
the case of so complex an aggregation of particulars 
as are comprehended in anything which can be called 
a science the definition we set out with is seldom 
that which a more extensive knowledge of the subject

 introduction 

shows to be the most appropriate until we know 
the particulars themselves we cannot fix upon the 
most correct and compact mode of circumscribing 
them by a general description it was not till after 
an extensive and accurate acquaintance with the 
details of chemical phenomena that it was foimd 
possible to frame a rational definition of chemistry 
and the definition of the science of life and organi 
zation is still a matter of dispute so long as the 
sciences are imperfect the definitions must partake 
of their imperfections and if the former are pro 
gressive the latter ought to be so too as much 
therefore as is to be expected from a definition 
placed at the commencement of a subject is that it 
should define the scope of our inquiries and the 
definition which i am about to ofier of the science of 
logic pretends to nothing more than to be a state 
ment of the question which i have put to myself and 
which this book is an attempt to resolve ttie reader 
is at liberty to object to it as a definition of logic but 
it is at all events a conect definition of the subject of 
these volumes 

 logic has often been called the art of rea 
soning a writer who has done more than any 
other living person to restore this study to the rank 
from which it had fallen in the estimation of the cul 
tivated classes in our own country has adopted the 
above definition with an amendment he has defined 
logic to be the science as well as the art of reason 
ing meaning by the former term the analysis of the 
mental process which takes place whenever we reason 
and by the latter the rules grounded upon that 



archbishop whately

definition and province of logic 

analysis for conducting the process correctly there 
can be no doubt as to the propriety of the emendation 
a right understanding of the mental process itself of 
the conditions it depends upon and the steps of 
which it consists is the only basis on which a system 
of rules fitted for the direction of the process can 
possibly be founded art necessarily presupposes 
knowledge art in any but its infant state presup 
poses scientific knowledge and if every art does not 
bear the name of the science upon which it rests it 
is only because several sciences are often necessary to 
form the groundwork of a single art such is the 
complication of human affsurs that to enable one 
thing to be done it is often requisite to know the 
nature and properties of many things 

ixc then comprises the science of reasoning 
as well as an art founded on that science but the 
word reasoning again like most other scientific 
terms in popular use abounds in ambiguities in 
one of its acceptations it means syllogizing or the 
mode of inference which may be called with suffi 
cient accuracy for the present purpose concluding 
from generals to particulars in another of its senses 
to reason is simply to infer any assertion from asser 
tions already admitted and in this sense induction 
is as much entitled to be called reasoning as the 
demonstrations of geometry 

writers on logic have generally preferred the for 
mer acceptation of the term the latter and more 
extensive signification is that in which i mean to use 
it i do this by virtue of the right i claim for every 
author to give whatever provisional definition he 
pleases of his own subject but sufficient reasons 
will i believe unfold themselves as we advance why 
this should be not only the provisional but the final

 introduction 

definition it involves at all events no arbitrary 
change in the meaning of the word for with the 
general usage of the english language the wider sig 
nification i believe accords better than the more 
restricted one 

 but reasoning even in the widest sense of 
which the word is susceptible does not seem to include 
all that is included either in the best or even in the 
most current conception of the scope and province 
of our science the employment of the word logic 
to denote the theory of argumentation is derived from 
the aristoteuan or as they are commonly termed the 
scholastic logicians yet even with them in their 
systematic treatises argumentation was the subject 
only of the third part the two former treated of 
terms and of propositions under one or other of 
which heads were moreover included definition and 
division professedly indeed these previous topics 
were introduced only on account of their connexion 
with reasoning and as a preparation for the doctrine 
and rules of the syllogism yet they were treated 
with greater minuteness and dwelt upon at greater 
length than was required for that purpose alone 
more recent writers on logic have generally under 
stood the term as it was employed by the able authors 
of the port royal logic viz as equivalent to the 
art of thinking nor is this acceptation confined 
to philosophers and works of science even in con 
versation the ideas usually connected with the word 
logic include at least precision of language and accu 
racy of classification and we perhaps oftener hear 
persons speak of a logical arrangement or expressions 
logically defined than of conclusions logically deduced 
from premisses moreover a man is often called a

definition and prgvincb of logic o 

great logician or a man of powerful logic not for the 
accuracy of his deductions but for the extent of his 
command over premisses because the general proposi 
tions required for explaining a difficulty or refuting a 
sophism copiously and promptly occur to him as in 
the case of chillingworth or samuel johnson whe 
ther therefore we conform to the practice of those 
who have made the subject their particular study 
or to that of popular writers and common discourse 
the province of logic will include several operations of 
the intellect not usually considered to fall within the 
meaning of the terms reasoning and argumentation 
these various operations might be brought within 
the compass of the science and the additional advan 
tage be obtained of a very simple definition if by an 
extension of the term sanctioned by high authorities 
we were to define logic as the science which treats of 
the operations of the human understanding in the pur 
suit of truth for to this ultimate end naming clas 
sification definition and all the other operations over 
which logic has ever claimed jurisdiction are essen 
tially subsidiary they may all be regarded as con 
trivances for enabling a person to know the truths 
which are needful to him and to know them at the 
precise moment at which they are needful other 
purposes indeed are also served by these operations 
for instance that of imparting our knowledge to 
others but viewed with regard to this purpose they 
have never been considered as within the province of 
the logician the sole object of logic is the guidance 
of ones own thoughts the communication of those 
thoughts to others falls under the consideration of 
rhetoric in the large sense in which that art was 
conceived by the ancients or of the still more exten 
sive art of education logic takes cognizance of all

 introduction 

intellectual operations only as they conduce to our 
own knowledge and to our command over that know 
ledge for our own uses if there were but one 
rational being in the universe that being might be a 
perfect logician and the science and art of logic 
would be the same for that one person as for the 
whole human race 

§ but if the definition which we formerly 
examined included too little that which is now sug 
gested has the opposite fault of including too much 

truths are known to us in two ways some are 
known directly and of themselves some through the 
medium of other truths the former are the subject 
of intuition or consciousness the latter of inference 
the truths known by intuition are the original pre 
misses from which all others are inferred our assent 
to the conclusion being grounded upon the truth of 
the premisses we never could arrive at any knowledge 
by reasoning unless something could be known ante 
cedently to all reasoning 

examples of truths known to us by immediate 
consciousness are our own bodily sensations and 
mental feelings i know directly and of my own 
knowledge that i was vexed yesterday or that i am 
hungry today examples of truths which we know 
only by way of inference are occurrences which took 
place while we were absent the events recorded in 
history or the theorems of mathematics the two 
former we infer from the testimony adduced or frtm 
the traces of those past occurrences which still exist 
the latter from the premisses laid down in books of 
geometry under the title of definitions and axioms 
whatever we are capable of knowing must belong to 
the one class or to the other must be in the number

be drawn therefrom 

with the original data or ultimate premisses of 
our knowledge with their nmnber or nature the 
mode in which they are obtained or the tests by 
which they may be distinguished logic in a direct 
way at least has in the sense in which i conceive the 
science nothing to do these questions are partly 
not a subject of science at all partly that of a very 
different science 

whatever is known to us by consciousness is 
known beyond possibility of question what one 
sees or feels whether bodily or mentally one cannot 
but be sure that one sees or feels no science is 
required for the purpose of establishing such truths 
no rules of art can render our knowledge of them 
more certain than it is in itself there is no logic for 
this portion of our knowledge 

but we may fancy that we see or feel what we 
in reality infer newton saw the truth of many pro 
positions of geometry without reading the demonstra 
tions but not we may be sure without their flashing 
through his mind a truth or supposed truth which 
is really the result of a very rapid inference may 
seem to be apprehended intuitively it has long been 
agreed by philosophers of the most opposite schools 
that this mistake is actually made in so familiar an 
instance as that of the eyesight there is nothing 
which we appear to ourselves more directly conscious 
of than the distance of an object from us yet it 
has long been ascertained that what is perceived by 
the eye is at most nothing more than a variously 
coloured surface that when we fancy we see distance 
all we really see is certain variations of apparent size 
and more or less faintness of colour and that our

estimate of the objects distance from us is the result 
of a comparison made with so much rapidity that 
we are imconscious of making it between the size 
and colour of the object as they appear at the time 
and the size and colour of the same or of similar 
objects as they appeared when close at hand or 
when their degree of remoteness was known by other 
evidence the perception of distance by the eye 
which seems so like intuition is thus in reality an 
inferencegrounded on experience an inference too 
which we learn to make and which we make with 
more and more correctness as our experience increases 
though in famiuar cases it takes place so rapidly as to 
appear exactly on a par with those perceptions of sight 
which are really intuitive our perceptions of colour 
of the science therefore which expounds the 
operations of the human imderstanding in the pursuit 
of truth one essential part is the inquiry what are 
the truths which are the objects of intuition or con 
sciousness and what are those which we merely infer 
but this inquiry has never been considered a portion 
of logic its place is in another and a perfectly dis 
tinct department of science which may be called the 
higher or transcendental metaphysics for such is 
the title which has been given to that portion of 
mental philosophy which attempts to determine what 
part of the furniture of the mind belongs to it origi 
nally and what part is constructed by itself out of 



 this celebrated theory has recently been called in question by 
a writer of deserved reputation mr samuel bailey but i do not

definition and province of logic 

materials famished from without to this science 
appertain the great and much debated questions of 
the existence of matter of the existence of spirit 
and the distinction between it and matter of the 
reality of time and space as things without the mind 
and distinguishable from the objects which are said to 
exist in them for in the present state of the dis 
cussion on these topics it is universally allowed that 
the existence of matter or of spirit of space or of 
time is in its nature unsusceptible of being proved 
and that whatever is known of them is known by 
immediate intuition to the same science belong the 
inquiries into the nature of conception perception 
memory and belief all of which are operations of 
the understanding in the pursuit of truth but with 
which as phenomena of the mind or with the possi 
bility which may or may not exist of analyzing any 
of them into simpler phenomena the logician as such 
has no concern to this science must also be referred 
the following and all analogous questions to what 
extent our intellectual faculties and our emotions are 
innate — to what extent the result of association 
whether god and duty are realities the existence of 
which is manifest to us a priori by the constitution 
of our rational faculty or whether our ideas of them 
are acquired notions the origin of which we are able 
to traceand explain and the reality of the objects 
themselves a question not of consciousness or intui 
tion but of evidence and reasoning 

the province of logic must be restricted to that 
portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences 
from truths previously known whether those ante

 introduction 

evidence so far forth as belief professes to be 
founded upon proof the office of logic is to supply a 
test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well 
grounded with the claims which any proposition 
has to belief on its own intrinsic evidence that is 
without evidence in the proper sense of the word logic 
has nothing to do 

§ as the far greatest portion of our knowledge 
whether of general truths or of particular facts is 
avowedly matter of inference nearly the whole not 
only of science but of human conduct is amenable 
to the authority of logic to draw inferences has 
been said to be the great business of life every one 
has daily hourly and momentary need of ascertaining 
facts which he has not directly observed not from 
any general purpose of adding to his stock of know 
ledge but because the facts themselves are of import 
ance to his interests or to his occupations the 
business of the magistrate of the military commander 
of the navigator of the physician of the agriculturist 
is merely to judge of evidence and to act accordingly 
they all have to ascertain certain facts in order that 
they may afterwards apply certain rules either devised 
by themselves or prescribed for their guidance by 
others and as they do this well or iu so they dis 
charge well or ill the duties of their several callings 
it is the only occupation in which the mind never 
ceases to be engaged and is the subject not of logic 
but of knowledge in general our definition of logic 
therefore will be in danger of including the whole 
field of knowledge unless we qualify it by some further 
limitation showing distinctly where the domain of the 
other arts and sciences and of common prudence ends 
and that of logic begins

definition and province of logic 

the distinction is that the science or knowledge 
of the particular subjectmatter furnishes the evidence 
while logic furnishes the principles and rules of the 
estimation of evidence logic does not pretend to 
teach the surgeon what are the symptoms which indi 
cate a violent death this he must learn from his 
own experience and observation or from that of others 
his predecessors in his peculiar science but logic 
sits in judgment on the sufficiency of that observation 
and experience to justify his rules and on the suffici 
ency of his rules to justify his conduct it does not 
give him proofs but teaches him what makes them 
proofs and how he is to judge of them logic alone 
can never show that the fact a proves the fact b but 
it can point out to what conditions all facts must 
conform in order that they may prove other facts 
to decide whether any given fact fulfils these condi 
tions or whether facts can be found which fulfil them 
in any given case belongs exclusively to the parti 
cular art or science or to our knowledge of the par 
ticular subject 

it is in this sense that logic is what bacon so 
expressively called it ars artium the science of 
science itself all science consists of data and con 
clusions from those data of proofs and what they 
prove now logic points out what relations must sub 
sist between data and whatever can be concluded 
from them between proof and everything which it 
can prove if there be any such indispensable rela 
tions and if these can be precisely determined every 
particular branch of science as well as every indi 
vidual in the guidance of his conduct is bound 
to conform to those relations under the penalty of 
making false inferences of drawing conclusions which 
are not grounded in the realities of things whatever

 introduction 

has at any time been concluded justly whatever know 
ledge has been acquired otherwise than by immediate 
intuition depended upon the observance of the laws 
which it is the province of logic to investigate if the 
conclusions are just and the knowledge sound those 
laws have actually been observed 

§ we need not therefore seek any farther for 
a solution of the question so often agitated respect 
ing the utility of logic if a science of logic exists or 
is capable of existing it must be useful if there be 
rules to which every mind conforms in every instance 
in which it judges rightly there seems little necessity 
for discussing whether a person is more likely to 
observe those rules when he knows the rules than 
when he is unacquainted with them 

a science may undoubtedly be brought to a certain 
not inconsiderable stage of advancement without the 
application of any other logic to it than what all per 
sons who are said to have a sound understanding 
acquire empirically in the course of their studies 
men judged of evidence and often very correctly 
before logic was a science or they never could have 
made it one and they executed great mechanical 
works before they understood the laws of mechanics 
but there are limits both to what mechanicians can 
do without principles of mechanics and to what 
thinkers can do without principles of logic and the 
limits in the two cases are of the same kind the 
extent of what man can do without understanding the 
theory of what he is doing is in all cases much the 
same he can do whatever is very easy what requires 
only time and patient industry but in the progress 
of science from its easiest to its more difficult pro 
blems every great step in advance has had either as

definition and provincb of logic 

its precursor or as its accompaniment and necessary 
condition a corresponding improvement in the notions 
and principles of logic received among the most ad 
vanced thinkers and if several of the more difficult 
sciences are still in so defective a state if not only so 
uttle is proved but disputation has not terminated 
even about the little which seemed to be so the 
reason perhaps is that mens logical notions have not 
yet acquired the degree of extension or of accuracy 
requisite for the estimation of the evidence proper to 
those particular departments of knowledge 

§ logic then is the science of the operations 
of the understanding which are subservient to the i 
estimation of evidence both the process itself of pro 
ceeding from known truths to unknown and all intel 
lectual operations auxiliary to this it includes 
therefore the operation of naming for language is 
an instrument of thought as well as a means of 
communicating our thoughts it includes also 
definition and classification for the use of these 
operations putting all other minds than ones own 
out of consideration is to serve not only for keeping 
our evidences and the conclusions from themrma 
nent and readily accessible in the memory but for so 
marshalling the facts which we may at any time be 
engaged in investigating as to enable us to perceive 
more clearly what evidence there is and to judge 
with fewer chances of error whether it be sufficient 
the analysis of the instruments we employ in the 
investigation of truth is part of the analysis of the 
investigation itself since no art is complete unless 
another art that of constructing the tools and fitting 
them for the purposes of the art is embodied in it 

our object therefore will be to attempt a correct 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 introduction 

analysis of the intellectual process called reasoning or 
inference and of such other mental operations as are 
intended to faciutate this as well as on the founda 
tion of this analysis and pari passu with it to bring 
together or frame a set of rules or canons for testing 
the sufficiency of any given evidence to prove any 
given proposition 

with respect to the first part of this undertaking 
i do not attempt to decompose the mental operations 
in question into their ultimate elements it is enough 
if the analysis as far as it goes is correct and if it 
goes far enough for the practical purposes of logic 
considered as an art the separation of a compucated 
phenomenon into its component parts is not hke a 
connected and interdependent chain of proof if one 
link of an argument breaks the whole drops to the 
ground but one step towards an analysis holds good 
and has an independent value though we should 
never be able to make a second hie results of 
analytical chemistry are not the less valuable though 
it should be discovered that all which we now cau 
simple substances are really compounds all other 
things are at any rate compounded of those elements 
whether the elements themselves admit of decomposi 
tion is an important inquiry but does not affect the 
certainty of the science up to that point 

i shall accordingly attempt to analyze the process 
of inference and the processes subordinate to infe 
rence so far only as may be requisite for ascertaining 
the difference between a correct and an incorrect 
performance of those processes the reason for thus 
limiting our design is evident it has been said by 
objectors to logic that we do not learn to use our 
muscles by studying their anatomy the fact is not 
quite fairly stated for if the action of any of our 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition and province of logic 

muscles were vitiated by local weakness or other 
physical defect a knowledge of their anatomy might 
be very necessary for effecting a cure but we should 
be justly liable to the criticism involved in this objec 
tion were we in a treatise on logic to carry the 
analysis of the reasoning process beyond the point at 
which any inaccuracy which may have crept into it 
must become visible in learning bodily exercises to 
carry on the same illustration we do and must 
analyze the bodily motions so far as is necessary for 
distinguishing those which ought to be performed 
from those which ought not to a similar extent 
and no further it is necessary that the logician should 
analyze the mental processes with which logic is 
concerned any ulterior and minuter analysis must 
be left to transcendental metaphysics which in this 
as in other parts of our mental nature decides 
what are ultimate facts and what are resolvable into 
other facts and i beueve it will be found that 
the conclusions arrived at in this work have no 
necessary connexion with any particular views re 
specting the ulterior analysis logic is common 
ground on which the partisans of hartley and of 
reid of locke and of kant may meet and join 
hands particular and detached opinions of au these 
philosophers will no doubt occasionally be controverted 
since all of them were logicians as well as metaphy 
sicians but the field on which their great battles have 
been fought lies beyond the boundaries of our science 
and the views which will be here promulgated may i 
believe be held in conjunction with the principal 
conclusions of any one of their systems of philosophy 
it cannot indeed be pretended that logical prin 
ciples can be altogether irrelevant to those more 
abstruse discussions nor is it possible but that the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 introduction 

view we are led to take of the problem which logic 
proposes must have a tendency favourable to the 
adoption of some one opinion on these controverted 
subjects rather than another logic although differing 
from the higher metaphysics like the other half of a 
a great whole the one being the science of the appre 
ciation of evidence the other having for its main 
object to determine what are the propositions for the 
establishment of which evidence is not required yet 
when viewed under another of its aspects stands m 
the same relation to tliis its sister science as it does 
to all the other sciences for metaphysics in endea 
vouring to solve its own peculiar problem must 
employ means the vaudity of which falls under the 
cognizance of logic it proceeds no doubt as far as 
possible merely by a closer and more attentive inter 
rogation of our consciousness or more properly 
speaking of our memory and so far is not amenable 
to logic but wherever this method is insufficient to 
attain the end of its inquiries it must proceed like 
other sciences by means of evidence now the 
moment this science begins to draw inferences from 
evidence logic becomes the sovereign judge whether 
its inferences are wellgrounded or what other 
inferences would be so 

this influence however of logic over the ques 
tions which have divided philosophers in the higher 
regions of metaphysics is indirect and remote and i 
can conscientiously affirm that no one proposition 
laid down in this work has been adopted for the sake 
of establishing or with any reference to its fitness for 
being employed in establishing preconceived opinions 
in any department of knowledge or of inquiry on 
which the speculative world is stiu undecided

chapter i 

of the necessity of commencing with an 
analysis of language 

§ i it is so much the established practice of 
writers oa logic to commence their treatises by a few 
general observations in most cases it is true rather 
meagre on terms and their varieties that it will 
perhaps scarcely be required from me in merely 
following the common usage to be as particular in 
assigning my reasons as it is usually expected that 
those should be who deviate from it 

the practice indeed is recommended by con 
siderations far too obvious to require a formal justifi 
cation logic is a portion of the art of thinking 
language is evidently and by the admission of all 
philosophers one of the principal instruments or helps 
of thought and any imperfection in the instrument 
or isx the mode of employing it is confessedly liable 
still ipore than in almost any other art to confuse and 
impede the process and destroy all ground of con 
fidence in the result for a mind not previously 
versed in the meaning and right use of the various 
kinds of words to attempt the study of methods of 
philosophizing would be as if some one should attempt 
to make himself an astronomical observer having 
never learned to adjust the focal distance of his 
optical instruments so as to see distinctly 

since reasoning or inference the principal

 names and propositions 

subject of logic is an operation which usually takes 
place by means of words and in all complicated cases 
can take place in no other way those who have not 
a thorough insight into the signification and purposes 
of words will be under almost a necessity of reasoning 
or inferring incorrectly and logicians have generally 
felt that unless in the very first stage they removed 
this fertile source of error unless they taught their 
pupil to put away the glasses which distort the object 
and to use those which are adapted to his purpose in 
such a manner as to assist not perplex his vision he 
would not be in a condition to practise the remaining 
part of their discipline with any prospect of advantage 
therefore it is that an inquiry into language so for 
as is needful to guard against the errors to which it 
gives rise has at all times been deemed a necessary 
preliminary to the science of logic 

but there is another reason of a still more funda 
mental nature why the import of words should be 
the earliest subject of the logicians consideration 
because without it he cannot eicaroine into the import 
of propositions now this is a subject which stands 
on the very threshold of the science of logic 

the object of logic as defined in the introductory 
chapter is to ascertain how we come by that portion 
of our knowledge much the greatest portion which 
is not intuitive and by what criterion we can in 
matters not selfevident distinguish between things 
proved and things not proved between what is 
worthy and what is unworthy of belief of the 
various questions which the universe presents to our 
inquiring faculties some are soluble by direct con 
sciousness others only by means of evidence logic 
is concerned with these last the solution by means 
of evidence of questions respecting the universe and

necessity of an analysis of names 

the things contained in it is the purpose of logic 
but before inquiring into the mode of resolving 
questions it is necessary to inquire what are the 
questions which present themselves what questions 
are conceivable what inquiries are there to which 
men have either obtained or been able to imagine it 
possible that they should obtain an answer this 
point is best ascertained by a survey and analysis of 
propositions 

 the answer to every question which it is 
possible to frame is contained in a proposition or 
assertion whatever can be an object of belief or 
even of disbelief must when put into words assume 
the form of a proposition all truth and all errdr lie 
in propositions what by a convenient misapplica 
tion of an abstract term we call a truth is simply a 
true proposition and errors are false propositions 
to know the import of all possible propositions would 
be to know all questions which can be raised all 
matters which are susceptible of being either believed 
or disbelieved how many kinds of inquiries can be 
propounded how many kinds of judgments can be 
made and how many kinds of propositions it is 
possible to frame with a meaning are but different 
forms of one and the same question since then the 
objects of all belief and of all inquiry express them 
selves in propositions a sufficient scrutiny of propo 
sitions and of their varieties will apprize us what 
questions mankind have actually asked themselves 
and what in the nature of answers to those questions 
they have actually thought they had grounds to 
believe 

now the first glance at a proposition shows that 
it is formed by putting together two names a pro

position according to the common simple definition 
which is sufficient for our purpose is discourse in 
which something is affirmed or denied of something 
thus in the proposition gold is yellow the quality 
yellow is affirmed of the substance gold in the pro 
position franklin was not bom in england the fact 
expressed by the words born in england is denied of 
the man franklin 

every proposition consists of three parts the 
subject the predicate and the copula the pre 
dicate is the name denoting that which is affirmed or 
denied the subject is the name denoting the person 
or thing which something is affirmed or denied of 
the copula is the sign denoting that there is an 
affirmation or denial and thereby enabling the hearer 
or reader to distinguish a proposition from any other 
kind of discourse thus in the proposition the 
earth is round the predicate is the word rounds which 
denotes the quality affirmed or as the phrase is 
predicated the earthy words denoting the object 
which that quality is affirmed of compose the subject 
the word is which serves as the connecting mark 
between the subject and predicate to show that one 
of them is affirmed of the other is called the copula 
dismissing for the present the copula of which 
more will be said hereafter every proposition then 
consists of at least two names brings together two 
names in a particular manner this is already a 
first step towards what we are in quest of it appears 
from this that for an act of belief one object is not 
sufficient the simplest act of belief supposes and 
has something to do with two objects two names to 
say the least and since the names must be names 
of something two nameahle things a large class of 
thinkers would cut the matter short by saying two

necessity of an analysis of names 

ideas they would say that the subject and predicate 
are both of them names of ideas the idea of gold 
for instance and the idea of yellow and that what 
takes place or a part of what takes place in the act 
of belief consists in bringing as it is often expressed 
one of these ideas under the other but this we are 
not yet in a condition to say whether such be the 
correct mode of describing the phenomenon is an 
after consideration the result with which for the 
present we must be contented is that in every act of 
belief two objects are in some manner taken cogni 
zance of that there can be no belief claimed or 
question propounded which does not embrace two 
distinct either material or intellectual subjects of 
thought each of them capable or not of being con 
ceived by itself but incapable of being believed by 
itself 

i may say for instance the sun the word 
has a meaning and suggests that meaning to the 
mind of any one who is listening to me but suppose 
i ask hun whether it is true whether he believes it 
he can give no answer there is as yet nothing to 
believe or to disbelieve now however let me 
make of all possible assertions respecting the sun 
the one which involves the least of reference to any 
object besides itself let me say the sun exists 
here at once is something which a person can say he 
believes but here instead of only one we find two 
distinct objects of conception the sun is one object 
existence is another let it not be said that this 
second conception existence is involved in the first 
for the sun may be conceived as no longer existing 
•the sun does not convey all the meaning that is 
conveyed by the sun exists my father does not 
include all the meaning of my father exists for

 names and propositions 

he may be dead a round square does not include 
the meaning of a round square exists for it does 
not and cannot exist when i say the sim my 
father or a round square i call upon the hearer 
for no belief or disbelief nor can either the one or 
the other be afforded me but if i say the sun 
exists my father exists or a round square 
exists i call for belief and should in the first of 
the three instances meet with it in the second with 
belief or disbelief as the case might be in the third 
with disbelief 

§ this first step in the analysis of the object of 
belief which though so obvious will be found to be 
not unimportant is the only one which we shall find 
it practicable to make without a preliminary survey of 
language if we attempt to proceed further in the 
same path that is to analyze any further the import 
of propositions we find forced upon us as a subject 
of previous consideration the import of names for 
every proposition consists of two names and every 
proposition affirms or denies one of these names of 
the other now what we do what passes in our mind 
when we affirm or deny two names of one another 
must depend upon what they are names of since it is 
with reference to that and not to the mere names 
themselves that we make the affirmation or denial 
here therefore we find a new reason why the signifi 
cation of names and the relation generally between 
names and the things signified by them must occupy 
the preliminary stage of the inquiry we are engaged in 

it may be objected that the meaning of names can 
guide us at most only to the opinions possibly the 
foolish and groundless opinions which mankind have 
formed concerning things and that as the object of

necbssity of an analysis of names 

philosophy is truth not opinion the philosopher 
should dismiss words and look into things themselves 
to ascertain what questions can be asked and answered 
in regard to them this advice which fortunately 
no one has it in his power to follow is in reality an 
exhortation to discard the whole fruits of the labours 
of his predecessors and demean himself as if he were 
the first person who had ever turned an inquiring eye 
upon nature what does any ones personal know 
ledge of things amount to after subtracting all which 
he has acquired by means of the words of other 
people even after he has learnt as much as men 
usually do learn from others will the notions of 
things contained in his individual mind afibrd as suffi 
cient a basis for a catalogue raisonnie as the notions 
which are in the minds of all mankind 

in any enimieration and classification of things 
which does not set out from their names no varieties 
of things wiu of course be comprehended but those 
recognised by the particular inquirer and it will still 
remain for him to establish by a subsequept exami 
nation of names that his enumeration has omitted 
nothing which ought to have been included but if 
we begin with names and use them as our clue to the 
things we bring at once before us all the distinctions 
which have been recognised not by a single inquirer 
of perhaps limited views but by the collective intelli 
gence of mankind it doubtless may and i believe 
it will be found that mankind have multiplied the 
varieties imnecessarily and have imagined distinctions 
among things where there were only distinctions in the 
manner of naming them but we are not entitled to 
assume this in the commencement we must begin 
by recognising the distinctions made by ordinary lan 
guage if some of these appear on a close examina

chapter ii 

of names 

§ a name says hobbes ms a word taken 
at pleasure to serve for a mark which may raise in 
our mind a thought like to some thought we had 
before and which being pronounced to others may 
be to them a sign of what thought the speaker hadf 
before in his mind this simple definition of a name 
as a word or set of words serving the double pur 
pose of a mark to recall to ourselves the likeness of a 
former thought and a sign to make it known to 
others appears unexceptionable names indeed do 
much more than this but whatever else they do 
grows out of and is the result of this as will appear 
in its proper place 

are names more properly said to be the names of 
things or of our ideas of things the first is the 
expression in common use the last is that of some 
philosophers who conceived that in adopting it they 
were introducing a highly important distinction the 
eminent thinker just quoted seems to countenance the 
latter opinion but seeing he continues names 
ordered in speech as is defined are signs of our con 
ceptions it is manifest they are not signs of the things 
themselves for that the sound of this word stone 
should be the sign of a stone cannot be understood

in any sense but this that he that hears it collects 
that he that pronounces it thinks of a stone 

if it be merely meant that the conception alone 
and not the thing itself is recalled by the name or 
imparted to the hearer this of course cannot be denied 
nevertheless there seems good reason for adhering to 
the common usage and calling the word sun the name 
of the sun and not the name of our idea of the sun 
for names are not intended only to make the hearer 
conceive what we conceive but also to inform him 
what we believe now when i use a name for the 
purpose of expressing a belief it is a belief concerning 
the thing itself not concerning my idea of it when 
i say the sun is the cause of day i do not mean 
that my idea of the sun causes or excites in me the 
idea of day but that the physical object the sun 
itself is the cause from which the outward pheno 
menon day follows as an effect it seems proper to 
consider a word as the name of that which we intend 
to be understood by it when we use it of that which 
any fact that we assert of it is to be understood of 
that in short concerning which when we employ the 
word we intend to give information names there 
fore shall always be spoken of in this work as the 
names of things themselves and not merely of our 
ideas of things 

but the question now arises of what things and 
to answer this it is necessary to take into consideration 
the different kinds of names 

 § it is usual before examining the various classes 
into which names are commonly divided to begin by 
distinguishing from names of every description those 
words which are not names but only parts of names 
among such are reckoned particles as of to truly y

names 

often the inflected cases of nouns substantive as me 
him johns and even adjectives as large hewy 
these words do not express things of which anything 
can be affirmed or denied we cannot say heavy 
fell or a heavy fell truly or a truly was asserted 
of or an of was in the room unless indeed we 
are speaking of the mere words themselves as when 
we say truly is an english word or heavy is an 
adjective in that case they are complete names viz 
names of those particular sounds or of those particular 
collections of written characters this employment 
of a word to denote the mere letters and syllables of 
which it is composed was termed by the schoolmen 
the suppositio materialis of the word in any other 
sense we cannot introduce one of these words into the 
subject of a proposition unless in combination with 
other words as a heavy body fell a truly important 
fact was asserted a member of parliament was in the 
room 

an adjective however is capable of standing by 
itself as the predicate of a proposition as when we 
say snow is white and occasionally even as the 
subject for we may say white is an agreeable colour 
the adjective is often said to be so used by a gram 
matical ellipsis snow is white instead of snow is a 
white object white is an agreeable colour instead of 
a white colour or the colour of white is agreeable 
the greeks and romans were permitted by the rules 
of their language to employ this ellipsis universally 



 it would perhaps be more correct to say that inflected cases 
are names and something more and that this addition prevents 
them from being used as the subjects of propositions but the 
purposes of our inquiry do not demand that we should enter with 
scrupulous accuracy into similar minutise

 names and propositions 

in the subject as well as in the predicate of a proposi 
tion in english this cannot generally speaking be 
done we may say the earth is round but we 
cannot say round is easily moved we must say a 
round object this distinction however is rather 
grammatical than logical since there is no differ 
ence of meaning between rounds and a round object it 
is only custom which prescribes that on any given 
occasion one shall be used and not the other we 
shall therefore without scruple speak of adjectives as 
names whether in their own right or as representa 
tive of the more circuitous forms of expression above 
exemplified the other classes of subsidiary words 
have no title whatever to be considered as names an 
adverb or an accusative case cannot under any circum 
stances except when their mere letters and syllables 
are spoken oo figure as one of the terms of a proposi 
tion 

words which are not capable of being used as 
names but only as parts of names were called by 
some of the schoolmen syncategorematic terms from 
ow with and koiopend to predicate because it was 
only with some other word that they could be predi 
cated a word which could be used either as the 
subject or predicate of a proposition without being 
accompanied by any other word was termed by the 
same authorities a categorematic term a combi 
nation of one or more categorematic and one or more 
syncategorematic words £s a heavy body or a 
court of justice they sometimes called a mixed term 
but this seems a needless multiplication of technical 
expressions a mixed term is in the only useful 
sense of the word categorematic it belongs to the 
class of what have been called manyworded names 

for as one word is frequently not a name but

names 

only part of a name so a number of words often 
compose one single name and no more thus in

form in the estimation of the logician only one name 
one categorematic term a mode of determining 
whether any set of words makes only one name or 
more than one is by predicating something of it and 
observing whether by this predication we make only 
one assertion or several thus when we say john 
nokes who was the mayor of the town died yester 
day — by this predication we make but one assertion 
whence it appears that john nokes who was the 
mayor of the town is no more than one name it 
is true that in this proposition besides the assertion 
that john nokes died yesterday there is included 
another assertion namely that john nokes was mayor 
of the town but this last assertion was already made 
we did not make it by adding the predicate died 
yesterday suppose however that the words had 
been john nokes and the mayor of the town 
they would have formed two names instead of one 
for when we say john nokes and the mayor of the 
town died yesterday we make two assertions one 
that john nokes died yesterday the other that the 
mayor of the town died yesterday 

it being needless to illustrate at any greater 
length the subject of manyworded names we pro 
ceed to the distinctions which have been established 
among names not according to the words they are 
composed of but according to their signification

 names and propositions 

 all names are names of something real or ima 
ginary but all things have not names appropriated to 
them individually for some individual objects we 
require and consequently have separate distinguish 
ing names there is a mxne for every person and for 
every remarkable place other objects of which we 
have not occasion to speak so frequently we do not 
designate by a name of their own but when the neces 
sity arises for naming them we do so by putting 
together several words each of which by itself might 
be and is used for an indefinite number of other ob 
jects as when i say this stone this and stone 
being each of them names that may be used of many 
other objects besides the particular one meant 
although the only object of which they can both be 
used at the given moment consistently with their sig 
nification may be the one of which i wish to speak 

were this the sole purpose for which names that 
are common to more things than one could be em 
ployed if they only served by mutually limiting each 
other to afibrd a designation for such individual ob 
jects as have no names of their own they could only 
be ranked among contrivances for economizing the 
use of language but it is evident that this is not 
their sole function it is by their means that we are 
enabled to assert general propositions to affirm or 
deny any predicate of an indefinite number of things 
at once the distinction therefore between general 
names and individual or singular names is funda 
mental and may be considered as the first grand 
division of names 

a general name is familiarly defined a name 
which is capable of being truly affirmed in the same 
sense of each of an indefinite number of things an 
individual or singular name is a name which is only

names 

capable of being truly affirmed in the same sense 
of one thing 

thus man is capable of being truly affirmed of 
john peter george and other persons without assign 
able limits and it is affirmed of all of them in the 
same sense for the word man expresses certain qua 
lities and when we predicate it of those persons we 
assert that they all possess those qualities but john 
is only capable of being truly affirmed of one single 
person at least in the same sense for although 
there are many persons who bear that name it is not 
conferred upon them to indicate any qualities or any 
thing which belongs to them in common and cannot 
be said to be affirmed of them in any sense at all con 
sequently not in the same sense the present king 
of england is also an individual name for that 
there never can be more than one person at a time of 
whom it can be truly affirmed is implied in the mean 
ing of the words 

it is not unusual by way of explaining what is 
meant by a general name to say that it is the name of 
a class but this though a convenient mode of ex 
pression for some purposes is objectionable as a defi 
nition since it explains the clearer of two things by 
the more obscure it would be more logical to reverse 
the proposition and turn it into a definition of the 
word class a class is the indefinite multitude of 
individuals denoted by a general name 

it is necessary to distinguish general from collect 
tive names a general name is one which can be pre 
dicated of each individual of a multitude a collec 
tive name cannot be predicated of each separately 
but only of all taken together the th regiment 
of foot which is a collective name is not a general 
but an individual name for although it can be pre

 names and propositions 

dicated of a multitude of individual soldiers taken 
jointly it cannot be predicated of them severally 
we may say jones is a soldier and thompson is a 
soldier and smith is a soldier but we cannot say 
jones is the th regiment and thompson is the th 
regiment and smith is the th regiment we can 
only say jones and thompson and smith and 
brown and so forth enumerating all the soldiers 
are the th regiment 

 the th regiment is a collective name but 
not a general one • a regiment is both a collective 
and a general name general with respect to all indi 
vidual regiments of each of which separately it can 
be affirmed collective with respect to the individual 
soldiers of whom any regiment is composed 

§ the second general division of names is into 
concrete and abstract a concrete name is a name 
which stands for a thing an abstract name is a name 
which stands for an attribute of a thing thus john 
the sea this table are names of things white also 
is a name of a thing or rather of things white 
ness again is the name of a quality or attribute of 
those things man is a name of many things huma 
nity is a name of an attribute of those things old 
is a name of things old age is a name of one of their 
attributes 

i have used the words concrete and abstract in 
the sense annexed to them by the schoolmen who 
notwithstanding the imperfections of their philosophy 
were unrivalled in the construction of technical lan 
guage and whose definitions in logic at least though 
they never went more than a little way into the sub 
ject have seldom i think been altered but to be 
spoiled a practice however has grown up in more

names 

modem times which if not introduced by locke has 
gained currency chiefly from his example of applying 
the expression abstract name to all names which 
are the result of abstraction or generalization and 
consequently to all general names instead of confining 
it to the names of attributes the metaphysicians of 
the condillac school — whose admiration of locke 
passing over the profoundest speculations of that 
truly original genius usually fastens with peculiar 
eagerness upon his weakest points — have gone on 
imitating him in this abuse of language until there 
is now some difficulty in restoring the word to its ori 
ginal signification a more wanton alteration in the 
meaning of a word is rarely to be met with for the 
expression general namey the exact equivalent of which 
exists in all languages i am acquainted with was 
already available for the purpose to which ahstract 
has been misappropriated while the misappropriation 
leaves that important class of words the names of 
attributes without any compact distinctive appella 
tion the old acceptation however has not gone so 
completely out of use as to deprive those who still 
adhere to it of all chance of being understood by 
ahstract then i shall always mean the opposite of 
concrete by an abstract name the name of an attri 
bute by a concrete name the name of an object 

do abstract names belong to the class of general 
or to that of singular names some of them are 
certainly general i mean those which are names not 
of one single and definite attribute but of a class of 
attributes such is the word colour j which is a name 
common to whiteness redness c such is even the 
word whiteness in respect of the different shades of 
whiteness to which it is applied in common the 
word magnitude in respect of the various degrees of 

dn by google 



 names and propositions 

magnitude and the various dimensions of space the 
word weight in respect of the various degrees of 
weight such also is the word attribute itself the 
common name of all particular attributes but when 
only one attribute neither variable in degree nor in 
kind is designated by the name as visibleness tan 
gibleness equality squareness milk whiteness then 
the name can hardly be considered general for though 
it denotes an attribute of many different objects the 
attribute itself is always conceived as one not many 
the question is however of no moment and perhaps 
the best way of deciding it would be to consider these 
names as neither general nor individual but to place 
them in a class apart 

it may be objected to our definition of an abstract 
name that not only the names which we have called 
abstract but adjectives which we have placed in the 
concrete class are names of attributes that whitcf 
for example is as much the name of the colour as 
whiteness is but as before remarked a word ought 
to be considered as the name of that which we intend 
to be understood by it when we put it to its principal 
use that is when we employ it in predication when 
we say snow is white milk is white linen is white 
we do not mean it to be understood that snow or 
linen or milk is a colour we mean that they are 
things having the colour the reverse is the case 
with the word whiteness what we affirm to be white 
ness is not snow but the colour of snow whiteness 
therefore is the name of the colour exclusively 
white is a name of all things whatever having the 
colour a name not of the quality whiteness but of 
every white object it is true this name was given 
to all those various objects on account of the quality 
and we may therefore say without impropriety that

names 

the quality forms part of its signification but a name 
can only be said to stand for or to be a name of the 
things of which it can be predicated we shall pre 
sently see that all names which can be said to have 
any signification all names by applying which to an 
individual we give any information respecting that 
individual may be said to imply an attribute of some 
sort but they are not names of the attribute it has 
its own proper abstract name 

§ this leads us to the consideration of the third 
great division of names into connotative and non 
cormotativey the latter sometimes but improperly called 
absolute this is one of the most important distinctions 
which we shall have occasion to point out and one of 
those which go deepest into the nature of language 

a nonconnotative term is one which signifies a 
subject only or an attribute only a connotative 
term is one which denotes a subject and implies an 
attribute by a subject is here meant anything 
which possesses attributes thus john or london 
or england are names which signify a subject only 
whiteness length virtue signify an attribute only 
none of these names therefore are connotative but 
whitcj long virtuous are connotative the word 
white denotes all white things as snow paper the 
foam of the sea c and impues or as it was termed 
by the schoolmen connotes the attribute whiteness 
the word white is not predicated of the attribute but 
of the subjects snow c but when we predicate it 
of them we imply or connote that the attribute 
whiteness belongs to them the same may be said

 names and propositions 

of the other words above cited virtuous for example 
is the name of a class which includes socrates 
howard the man of ross and an undefined nimiber 
of other individuals past present and to come 
these individuals collectively and severally can alone 
be said with propriety to be denoted by the word of 
them alone can it properly be said to be a name but 
it is a name applied to all of them in consequence of 
an attribute which they possess in common the attri 
bute which men have agreed to call virtue it is 
applied to all beings that are considered to possess this 
attribute and to none which are not so considered 

all concrete general names are connotative the 
word man for example denotes peter paul john 
and an indefinite number of other individuals of 
whom taken as a class it is the name but it is 
applied to them because they possess and to signify 
that they possess certain attributes these seem to 
be corporeity animal life rationality and a certain 
external form which for distinction we call the 
human every existing thing which possessed all 
these attributes would be called a man and any 
thing which possessed none of them or only one or 
two or even three of them without the fourth would 
not be so called for example if in the interior of 
africa there were to be discovered a race of animals 
possessing reason equal to that of human beings but 
with the form of an elephant they would not be called 
men swifts houyhnhms were not so called or 
if such newlydiscovered beings possessed the form of 
man without any vestige of reason it is probable that 
some other name than that of man would be found 
for them how it happens that there can be any 
doubt about the matter will appear hereafter the 
word man therefore signifies all these attributes and 

digitized by vjooq ic 



names 

all subjects which possess these attributes but it 
can be predicated only of the subjects what we call 
men are the subjects the individual stiles and nokes 
not the qualities by which their humanity is consti 
tuted the name therefore is said to signify the 
subjects directly the attributes indirectly it denotes 
the subjects and implies or involves or indicates or 
as we shall say henceforth connotes the attributes it 
is a connotative name 

connotative names have hence been also called 
denominative because the subject which they denote is 
denominated by or receives a name from the attri 
bute which they connote snow and other objects 
receive the name white because they possess the 
attribute which is called whiteness james and ro 
bert receive the name man because they possess the 
attributes which are considered to constitute humanity 
the attribute or attributes may therefore be said to 
denominate those objects or to give them a common 
name 

it has been seen that all concrete general names 
are connotative even abstract names though the 
names only of attributes may in some instances be 
justly considered as connotative for attributes them 
selves may have attributes ascribed to them and a 
word which denotes attributes may comkte an attri 
bute of those attributes it is thus for example 
with such a word as fault equivalent to bad or 
hurtful quality this word is a name common to 
many attributes and connotes hurtfiilness an attribute 
of those various attributes when for example we 
say that slowness in a horse is a fault we do not 
mean that the slow movement the actual change of 
place of the slow horse has any mischievous effects 
but that the property or peculiarity of the horse from 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

which it derives that name the quality of being a slow 
mover is an undesirable peculiarity 

in regard to those concrete names which are not 
general but individual a distinction must be made 

proper names are not connotative they denote 
the individuals who are called by them but they do 
not indicate or imply any attributes as belonging to 
those individuals when we name a child by the 
name mary or a dog by the name caesar these names 
are simply marks used to enable those individuals to 
be made subjects of discourse it may be said 
indeed that we must have had some reason for giving 
them those names rather than any others and this is 
true but the name once given becomes independent 
of the reason a man may have been named john 
because that was the name of his father a town may 
have been named dartmouth because it is situated at 
the mouth of the dart but it is no part of the 
signification of the word john that the father of the 
person so called bore the same name nor even of the 
word dartmouth to be situated at the mouth of the 
dart if sand should choke up the mouth of the 
river or an earthquake change its course and remove 
it to a distance from the town there is no reason to 
think that the name of the town would be changed 
that fact therefore can form no part of the significa 
tion of the word for otherwise when the fact ceased 
to be true the name would cease to be applied 
proper names are attached to the objects themselves 
and are not dependent upon the continuance of any 
attribute of the object 

but there is another kind of names which 
although they are individual names that is predi 
cable only of one object are really connotative for 
although we may give to an individual a name utterly 

digitized by vjooq ic 



names 

unmeaning which we call a proper name — a word 
which answers the purpose of showing what thing it 
is we are talking about but not of telling anything 
about it yet a name peculiar to an individual is not 
necessarily of this description it may be significant 
of some attribute or some union of attributes which 
being possessed by no object but one determines the 
name exclusively to that individual the stm is 
a name of this description god when used by a 
christian is another these however are scarcely 
examples of what we are now attempting to illustrate 
beings in strictness of language general and not 
individual names for however they may be in fact 
predicable only of one object there is nothing in the 
meaning of the words themselves which implies this 
and accordingly when we are imagining and not 
affirming we may speak of many suns and the 
majority of mankind have believed and still believe 
that there are many gods but it is easy to produce 
words which are real instances of connotative indi 
vidual names it may be part of the meaning of the 
connotative name itself that there exists but one 
individual possessing the attribute which it connotes 
as for instance the only son of john stiles the 
jirst emperor of rome or the attribute connoted 
may be a connexion with some determinate event and 
the connexion may be of such a kind as only one 
individual could have or may at least be such as only 
one individual actually had and this may be implied 
in the form of the expression the father of so 
crates is an example of the one kind since socrates 
could not have had two fathers the author of the 
iliad uhe murderer of henri quatre of the 
second for although it is conceivable that more 
persons than one might have participated in the

 names and propositions 

authorship of the iliad or in the murder of hiri 
quatre the employment of the article the implies 
that in fact this was not the case what is here 
done by the word the is done in other cases by the 
context thus caesars army is an individual name 
if it appears from the context that the army meant is 
that which caesar commanded in a particular battle 
the still more general expressions the roman 
army or the christian army may be indivi 
dualized in a similar manner another case of 
frequent occurrence has already been noticed it is 
the following the name being a manyworded one 
may consist in the first place of a general name 
capable therefore in itself of being affirmed of more 
things than one but which is in the second place so 
limited by other words joined with it that the entire 
expression can only be predicated of one object con 
sistently with the meaning of the general term this 
is exemplified in such an instance as the following 
the present prime minister of enand prime 
minister of england is a general name the attributes 
which it connotes may be possessed by an indefinite 
mmiber of persons in succession however not 
simultaneously since the meaning of the word itself 
imports among other things that there can be only 
one such person at a time this being the case and 
the application of the name being afterwards limited 
by tlie word present to such individuals as possess 
the attributes at one indivisible point of time it 
becomes appucable only to one individual and 
as this appears from the meaning of the name 
without any extrinsic proof it is strictly an individual 
name 

from the preceding observations it will easily be 
collected that whenever the names given to objects 

digitized by vjooq ic 



names 

convey any information that is whenever they have 
properly any meaning the meaning resides not in 
what they denotcy but in what they connote the 
only names of objects which connote nothing are 
proper names and these have strictly speaking no 
signification 

if like the robber in the arabian nights we make 
a mark with chalk upon a house to enable us to know 
it again the mark has a purpose but it has not pro 
perly any meaning the chalk does not declare any 
thing about the house it does not mean this is such 
a persons house or this is a house which contains 
booty the object of making the mark is merely 
distinction i say to myself all these houses are so 
nearly alike that if i lose sight of them i shall not 
again be able to distinguish that which i am now 
looking at from any of the others i must therefore 
contrive to make the appearance of this one house 
unlike that of the others that i may hereafter know 
when i see the mark — not indeed any attribute of the 
house — but simply that it is the same house which i 
am now looking at morgiana chalked all the other 
bouses in a similar manner and defeated the scheme 
how simply by obliterating the difference of ap 
pearance between that house and the others the 
chalk was still there but it no longer served the 
purpose of a distinctive mark 

when we impose a proper name we perform an 
operation in some degree analogous to what the robber 
intended in chalking the house we put a mark not 
indeed upon the object itself but if i may so speak 
upon the idea of the object a proper name is but 
an unmeaning mark which we connect in our minds 
with the idea of the object in order that whenever 
the mark meets our eyes or occurs to our thoughts 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 namjjs and propositions 

we may think of that individual object not being 
attached to the thing itself it does not enable us as 
the chalk did to distinguish the object when we see 
it but it enables us to distinguish it when it is 
spoken of either in the records of our own experience 
or in the discourse of others to know that what we 
find asserted in any proposition of which it is the 
subject is asserted of the individual thing with which 
we were previously acquainted 

when we predicate of anything its proper name 
when we say pointing to a man this is brown or 
smith or pointing to a city that it is york we do 
not merely by so doing convey to the hearer any 
information about them except that those are their 
names by enabling him to identify the individuals 
we may connect them with iilformation previously 
possessed by him by saying this is york we may 
tell him that it contains the minster but this is in 
virtue of what he has previously heard concerning 
york not by anything implied in the name it is 
otherwise when objects are spoken of by connotative 
names when we say the town is built of marble 
we give the hearer what may be entirely new informa 
tion and this merely by the signification of the many 
worded connotative name built of marble such 
names are not signs of the mere objects invented 
because we have occasion to think and speak of those 
objects individually but signs which accompany an 
attribute a kind of uvery in which the attribute 
clothes all objects which are recognised as possessing 
it they are not mere marks but more that is to 
say significant marks and the connotation is what 
constitutes their significance

one individual which it is predicated of so as well

from the importance of adhering to analogy as for the 
other reasons formerly assigned a connotative name 
ought to be considered a name of all the various indi 
viduals which it is predicable of or in other words 
denotes and not of what it connotes but by learning 
what things it is a name of we do not learn the 
meaning of the name for to the same thing we may 
with equal propriety apply many names not equiva 
lent in meaning thus i call a certain man by the 
name sophroniscus i call him by another name 
•the father of socrates both these are names of the 
same individual but their meaning is altogether 
different they are applied to that individual for two 
different purposes the one merely to distinguish 
him from other persons who are spoken of the other 
to indicate a fact relating to him the fact that 
socrates was his son i further apply to him these 
other expressions a man a greek an athenian a 
sculptor an old man an honest man a brave man 
all these are names of sophroniscus not indeed of him 
alone but of him and each of an indefinite number of 
other human beings each of these names is applied 
to sophroniscus for a different reason and by each 
whoever understands its meaning is apprised of a dis 
tinct fact or number of facts concerning him but 
those who knew nothing about the names except that 
they were appucable to sophroniscus would be alto 
gether ignorant of their meaning it is even conceiv 
able that i might know every single individual of 
whom a given name could be with truth affirmed 
and yet could not be said to know the meaning of the 
name a child knows who are its brothers and 
sisters long before it has any definite conception of 
the nature of the facts which are involved in the

in some cases it is not easy to decide precisely 
how much a particular word does or does not connote 
that is we do not exactly know the case not having 
arisen what degree of diflference in the object would 
occasion a difference in the name thus it is clear 
that the word man besides animal life and rationality 
connotes also a certain external form but it would 
be impossible to say precisely what form that is to 
decide how great a deviation from the form ordinarily 
found in the beings whom we are accustomed to call 
men would suffice in a newlydiscovered race to make 
us refuse them the name of man rationality also 
being a quality which admits of degrees it has never 
been settled what is the lowest degree of that quality 
which would entitle any creature to be considered a 
human being in all such cases the meaning of the 
general name is so far unsettled and vague mankind 
have not come to any positive agreement about the 
matter when we come to treat of classification we 
shall have occasion to show under what conditions 
this vagueness may exist without practical inconve 
nience and cases will appear in which the ends of 
language are better promoted by it than by complete 
precision in order that in natural history for 
instance individuals or species of no very marked 
character may be ranged with those more strongly 
characterized individuals or species to which in all 
their properties taken together they bear the nearest 
resemblance 

but this partial uncertainty in the connotation of 
names can only be free from mischief when guarded 
by strict precautions one of the chief sources 
indeed of lax habits of thought is the custom of using 
connotative terms without a distinctly ascertained 
connotation and with no more precise notion of

their meaning than can be loosely collected from 
observing what objects they are used to denote it is 
in this manner that we all acquire and inevitably so 
our first knowledge of our vernacular language a 
diild learns the meaning of the words mauy or whitcy 
by hearing them applied to a variety of individual 
objects and finding out by a process of generaliza 
tion and analysis of which he is but imperfectly con 
scious what those different objects have in common 
in the case of these two words the process is so 
easy as to require no assistance from culture the 
objects called human beings and the objects called 
white differing from all others by qualities of a 
peculiarly definite and obvious character but in 
many other cases objects bear a general resemblance 
to one another which leads to their being familiarly 
classed together under a common name while 
without more analytic habits than the generality 
of mankind possess it is not immediately apparent 
what are the particular attributes upon the posses 
sion of which in conmion by them all their general 
resemblance depends when this is the case men 
use the name without any recognized connotation 
that is without any precise meaning they talk 
and consequently think vaguely and remain con 
tented to attach only the same degree of significance 
to their own words which a child three years old 
attaches to the words brother and sister the child 
at least is seldom puzzled by the starting up of new 
individuals on whom he is ignorant whether or not 
to confer the title because there is usually an 
authority close at hand competent to solve all doubts 
but a similar resource does not exist in the generality 
of cases and new objects are continually presenting 
themselves to men women and children which they

are called upon to class propria motu they accord 
ingly do this on no other principle than that of 
superficial similarity giving to each new object the 
name of that familiar object the idea of which it most 
readily recalls or which on a cursory inspection it 
seems to them most to resemble as an unknown 
substance found in the ground will be called accord 
ing to its texture earth sand or a stone in this 
manner names creep on from subject to subject until 
all traces of a common meaning sometimes disappear 
and the word comes to denote a number of things not 
only independently of any common attribute but 
which have actually no attribute in common or none 
but what is shared by other things to which tlie name 
is capriciously refused even philosophers have 
aided in this perversion of general language from its 
purpose sometimes because like the vulgar they 
knew no better and sometimes in deference to that 
aversion to admit new words which induces mankind 
on all subjects not considered technical to attempt to 
make the original small stock of names serve with 



 it would be well if this natural degeneracy of language took 
place only in the hands of the ignorant vulgar but some of the 
most remarkable instances are to be found in terms of art and 
among technically educated persons such as english lawyers 
fehny for example is a law term with the sound of which all 
ears are familiar but there is no lawyer who would undertake to 
tell what a felony is otherwise than by enumerating the various 
kinds of offences which are so called originally the word felony 
had a meaning it denoted all offences the penalty of which 
included forfeiture of goods but subsequent acts of parliament 
have declared various offences to be felonies without enjoining that 
penalty and have taken away the penalty from others which 
continue nevertheless to be called felonies insomuch that the acts 
so called have now no property whatever in common save that of 
being unlawful and punishable

but little augmentation to express a constantly in 
creasing number of objects and distinctions and 
consequently to express them in a manner progres 
sively more and more imperfect 

to what degree this loose mode of classing and 
denominating objects has rendered the vocabulary of 
mental and moral philosophy unfit for the purposes of 
accurate thinking is best known to whoever has 
most reflected on the present condition of those 
branches of knowledge since however the intro 
duction of a new technical language as the vehicle of 
speculations on moral subjects would not in this 
country at least be tolerated and if tolerated would 
deprive those subjects of the benefit of the habitual 
feelings which have grown round the established 
phrases and jthe recognised groups and which would 
not for a long time take an equally strqng hold of 
new ones the problem for the philosopher and one 
of the most difficult which he has to resolve is in 
retaining the existing phraseology how best to 
alleviate its imperfections this can only be accom 
plished by giving to every general concrete name 
which he has frequent occasion to predicate a definite 
and fixed connotation in order that it may be known 
what attributes when we call an object by that name 
we really mean to predicate of the object and the 
question of most nicety is how to give this fixed 
connotation to a name with the least possible change 
in the objects which the name is habitually employed 
to denote with the least possible disarrangement 
either by adding or subtraction of the group of 
objects which it serves in however imperfect a man 
ner to circumscribe and hold together and with the 
least vitiation of the truth of any propositions which 
are commonly received as true

this desirable purpose of giving a fixed connota 
tion where it is wanting is the end aimed at whenever 
any one attempts to give a definition of a general 
name already in use every definition of a coimotative 
name being an attempt either merely to declare or to 
declare and analyze the connotation of the name 
and the fact that no questions which have arisen in 
the moral sciences have been subjects of keener 
controversy than the definitions of almost all the 
leading expressions is a proof how great an extent 
the evil to which we have adverted has attained 

names with indeterminate connotation are not 
to be confounded with names which have more than 
one connotation that is to say with ambiguous words 
a word may have several meanings but all of them 
fixed and recognised ones as the word post for 
example or the word box the various senses of 
which it would be endless to enumerate and the 
paucity of existing names in comparison with the 
demand for them may often render it advisable and 
even necessary to retain a name in this multiplicity 
of acceptations distinguishing these so clearly as to 
prevent their being confounded with one another 
such a word may be considered as two or more 
names accidentally written and spoken alike 



 before quitting the subject of connotative names it is proper 
to observe that the only recent writer who to my knowledge has 
adopted from the schoolmen the word to connote mr mill in 
his andlyns of the phenomena of the human mind employs it 
in a signification different from that in which it is here used 
he uses the word in a sense coextensive with its etymology 
applying it to every case in which a name while pointing directly 
to one thing which is consequently termed its signification 
includes also a tacit reference to some other thing in the case 
considered in the text that of concrete general names his language

names 

 the fourth principal division of names is 
into positive and negative positive as man tree 



and mine are the converse of one another considering very 
justly the signification of the name to lie in the attribute he 
speaks of the word as noting the attribute and eannoling the things 
possessing the attribute and he describes abstract names as 
being properly concrete names with their connotation dropped 
whereas in my view it is the ilmotation which would be said 
to be dropped what was previously connoted becoming the whole 
signification 

in adopting a phraseology at variance with that which so high 
an authority and one which i am less likely than any other 
person to undervalue has deliberately sanctioned i have been influ 
enced by the urgent necessity for a term exclusively appropriated 
to express the manner in which a concrete general name serves 
to mark the attributes which are involved in its signification this 
necessity can scarcely be felt in its full force by any one who 
has not found by experience how vain is the attempt to commu 
nicate clear ideas on the philosophy of language without such a 
word it is hardly an exaggeration to say that some of the most 
prevalent of the errors with which logic has been infected and a 
large part of the cloudiness and confusion of ideas which have enve 
loped it would in all probability have been avoided if a term had 
been in common use to express exactly what i have signified by 
the term to connote and the schoolmen to whom we are indebted 
for the greater part of our logical language gave us this also and 
in this very sense for although some of their general expressions 
countenance the use of the word in the more extensive and vague 
acceptation in which it is taken by mr mill yet when they had to 
define it specifically as a technical term and to fix its meaning as 
such with that admirable precision which always characterized 
their definitions they clearly explained that nothing was said to be 
connoted except rm which word may generally in their writings 
be understood as synonymous with attributet 

now if the word to connote so well suited to the purpose to 
which they applied it be diverted from that purpose by being 
taken to fulfil another for which it does not seem to me to be at 
all required i am unable to find any expression to replace it but 
such as are commonly employed in a sense so much more general 
that it would be useless attempting to associate them peculiarly 
with this precise idea such are the words to involve to imply

good negative as notmany noutree notgood to 
every positive concrete name a corresponding negative 
one might be framed after giving a name to any 
one thing or to any plurality of things we might 
create a second name which should be a name of all 
things whatever except that particular thing or things 
these negative names are employed whenever we have 
occasion to speak collectively of all things other than 
some thing or class of things when the positive 
name is connotative the corresponding negative 
name is connotative likewise but in a peculiar way 
connoting not the presence but the absence of an 
attribute thus notwhite denotes all things what 
ever except white things and connotes the attribute 
of not possessing whiteness for the nonpossession 
of any given attribute is also an attribute and may 
receive a name as such and thus negative concrete 
names may obtain negative abstract names to corre 
spond to them 

names which are positive in form are often 
negative in reality and others are really positive 
though their form is negative the word inconvenienty 
for example does not express the mere absence of 
convenience it expresses a positive attribute that of 
being the cause of discomfort or annoyance so the 
word unpleasant notwithstanding its negative form 
does not connote the mere absence of pleasantness 
but a less degree of what is signified by the word 
painful ywhchy it is hardly necessary to say is positive 



c by employing these i should fail of attaining the object for 
which alone the name is needed namely to distinguish this 
particular kind of involving and implying from all other kinds and 
to assure to it the degree of habitual attention which its import 
ance demands

iduy on the other hand is a word which though 
positive in form expresses nothing but what would be 
signified either by the phrase not working or by the 
phrase not disposed to work and sober either by not 
drunk or by not drunken 

there is a class of names called privative a 
privative name is equivalent in its signification to a 
positive and a negative name taken together being 
the name of something which has once had a par 
ticular attribute or for some other reason might hare 
been expected to have it but which has it not such 
is the word blind which is not equivalent to not seeing 
or to not capable of seeing for it would not except by 
a poetical or rhetorical figure be appued to stocks and 
stones a thing is not usually said to be blind unless 
the class to which it is most familiarly referred or to 
which it is referred on the particular occasion be 
chiefly composed of things which can see as in the 
case of a blind man or a blind horse or unless it is 
supposed for any reason that it ought to see as in 
saying of a man that he rushed blindly into an abyss 
or of philosophers or the clergy that the greater part 
of them are blind guides the names called privative 
therefore connote two things the absence of certain 
attributes and the presence of others from which the 
presence also of the former might naturally have been 
expected 

§ the fifth leading division of names is into 
relative and absolute or let us rather say relative and 
nonrelative for the word absolute is put upon much 
too hard duty in metaphysics not to be willingly 
spared when its services can be dispensed with it 
resembles the word dvil in the language of juris 
prudence which stands for the opposite of criminal

the opposite of ecclesiastical the opposite of military 
the opposite of political in short the opposite of any 
positive word which wants a negative 

relative names are such as father son ruler 
subject like equal unlike unequal longer shorter 
cause effect their characteristic property is that 
they are always given in pairs every relative name 
which is predicated of an object supposes another 
object or objects of which we may predicate either 
that same name or another relative name which is 
said to be the correlative of the former thus when 
we call any person a son we suppose other persons 
who must be called parents when we call any event 
a cause we suppose another event which is an effect 
when we say of any distance that it is longer we 
suppose another distance which is shorter when we 
say of any object that it is like we mean that it is 
like some other object which is also said to be like 
the first in this case both objects receive the same 
name the relative term is its own correlative 

it is evident that these words when concrete are 
like other concrete general names connotative they 
denote a subject and connote an attribute and each 
of them has or might have a corresponding abstract 
name to denote the attribute connoted by the concrete 
thus the concrete like has its abstract likeness the 
concretes £either and son have the abstracts paternity 
and filiation the concrete name connotes an attri 
bute and the abstract name which answers to it 
denotes that attribute but of what nature is the 
attribute wherein consists the peculiarity in the 
connotation of a relative name 

the attribute signified by a relative name say 
some is a relation and this they give if not as a 
sufficient explanation at least as the only one attain

able if they are asked what then is a relation 
they do not profess to be able to tell it is generally 
regarded as something peculiarly recondite and mys 
terious i cannot however perceive in what respect 
it is more so than any other attribute indeed it 
appears to me to be so in a somewhat less degree i 
conceive rather that it is by examining into the 
signification of relative names or in other words 
into the nature of the attribute which they connote 
that a clear insight may best be obtained into the 
nature of all attributes of all that is meant by an 
attribute 

it is obvious in fact that if we take any two 
correlative names father and son for instance 
although the objects cenoted by the names are dif 
ferent they both in a certain sense connote the same 
thing they cannot indeed be said to connote the 
same attribute to be a father is not the same thing 
as to be a son but when we cau one man a father 
another his son what we mean to affirm is a set of 
facts which are exactly the same in both cases to 
predicate of a that he is the father of b and of b 
that he is the son of a is to assert one and the same 
fact in different words the two propositions are 
exactly equivalent neither of them asserts more or 
asserts less than the other the paternity of a and 
the filiation of b are not two facts but two modes 
of expressing the same fact that fact when ana 
lyzed consists of a series of physical events or phe 
nomena in which both a and b are parties concerned 
and from which they both derive names what those 
names really connote is this series of events that is 
the meaning and the whole meaning which either of 
them is intended to convey the series of events 
may be said to constitute the relation the schoolmen

called it the foundation of the relation fundamentum 
relationis 

in this manner any fact or series of facts in which 
two different objects are implicated and which is 
therefore predicable of both of them may be either 
considered as constituting an attribute of the one or 
an attribute of the other according as we consider 
it in the former or in the latter aspect it is connoted 
by the one or the other of the two correlative names 
father connotes the fact regarded as constituting an 
attribute of a son tonnotes the same fact as con 
stituting an attribute of b it may evidently be 
regarded with equal propriety in either light and all 
that appears necessary to account for the existence of 
relative names is that whenever there is a fact in 
which two individuals are alike concerned an attribute 
grounded on that fact may be ascribed to either of 
these individuals 

a name therefore is said to be relative when over 
and above the object which it denotes it implies in 
its signification the existence of another object also 
deriving a denomination from the same fact which is 
the ground of the first name or to express the 
same meaning in other words a name is relative when 
being the name of one thing its signification cannot 
be explained but by mentioning another or we may 
state it thus — when the name cannot be employed 
in discourse so as to have a meaning unless the 
name of some other thing than what it is itself the 
name of be either expressed or understood we 
may take our choice among these definitions they 
are all at bottom equivalent being modes of 
variously expressing this one distinctive circum 
stance — that every other attribute of an object might 
without any contradiction be conceived still to exist

if all objects besides that one were annihilated 
but those of its attributes which are expressed by 
relative names would on that supposition be swept 
away 

§ names have been further distinguished into 
univocal and equivocal these however are not two 
kinds of names but two dilberent modes of employing 
names a name is univocal or applied univocally 
with respect to all things of which it can be predicated 
in the same sense but it is aequivocal or applied aequi 
vocally as respects those things of which it is predi 
cated in different senses it is scarcely necessary to 
give instances of a fact so familiar as the double 
meaning of a word in reality as has been already 
observed an aequivocal or ambiguous word is not one 
name but two names accidentally coinciding in sound 
file standing for an iron instrument and file standing 
for a line of soldiers have no more title to be con 
sidered one word because written alike than grease 
and greece have because they are pronoimced alike 
they are one sound appropriated to form two different 
words 

an intermediate case is that of a name used ana 
logically or metaphorically that is a name which is 
predicated of two things not univocally or exactly 
in the same signification but in significations some 
what similar and which being derived one from the 
other one of them may be considered the primary 
and the other a secondary signification as when we 
speak of a brilliant light and a brilliant achievement 



 or rather all objects except itself and the percipient mind 
for as we shall see hereafter to ascribe any attribute to an object 
necessarily implies a mind to perceive it

the word is not applied in the same sense to the light 
and to the achievement but having been applied to 
the light in its original sense that of brightness to the 
eye it is transferred to the achievement in a deriva

primitive one the word however is just as pro 
perly two names instead of one in this case as in 
that of the most perfect ambiguity and one of the 
commonest forms of fallacious reasoning arising from 
ambiguity is that of arguing from a metaphorical 
expression as if it were literal that is as if a word 
when applied metaphorically were the same name 
as when taken in its original sense which will be

chapter iii 

of the things denoted by names 

§ looking back now to the commeacement of 

our inquiry let us attempt to measure how far it has 

advanced logic we found is the theory of proof 

but proof supposes something provable which must 

be a proposition or assertion since nothing but a 

proposition can be an object of belief or therefore 

of proof a proposition is discourse which affirms 

or denies something of some other thing this is one 

step there must it seems be two things concerned 

in every act of belief but what are these things 

they can be no other than those signified by the two 

names which being joined together by a copula con 

stitute the proposition if therefore we knew what 

all names signiiy we should know everything which 

is capable either of being made a subject of affirmation 

or denial or of being itself affirmed or denied of a 

subject we have accordingly in the preceding 

chapter reviewed the various kinds of names in 

order to ascertain what is signified by each of them 

and we have now carried this survey far enough to 

be able to take an account of its results and to exhibit 

an enumeration of all the kinds of things which are 

capable of being made predicates or of having any 

thing predicated of them after which to determine 

the import of predication that is of propositions can 

be no arduous task 

the necessity of an enumeration of existences as 
the basis of logic did not escape the attention of the 
schoolmen and of their master aristotle the most

comprehensive if not the most sagacious of the 
ancient philosophers the categories or predica 
ments — the former a greek word the latter its literal 
translation in the latin language— were intended by 
him and his followers as an enumeration of all things 
capable of being named an enumeration by the 
summa genera i e the most extensive classes into 
which things could be distributed which therefore 
were so many highest predicates one or other of 
which was supposed capable of being affirmed with 
truth of every nameable thing whatsoever the follow 
ing are the classes into which according to this school 
of philosophy things in general might be reduced —

the imperfections of this classification are too 
obvious to require and its merits are not sufficient to

language of familiar life with little or no attempt to 
penetrate by philosophic analysis to the rationale 
even of those common distinctions such an ana 
lysis however superficially conducted would have 
shown the enumeration to be both redundant and 
defective some objects are omitted and others re

a very comprehensive view of the nature of relation 
which could exclude action passivity and local situa 
tion from that category the same observation 
applies to the categories quando or position in time 
and ubi or position in space while the distinction 
between the latter and situs is merely verbal the 
incongruity of erecting into a mmmum genus the class 
which forms the tenth category is manifest on the 
other hand the enumeration takes no notice of any 
thing besides substances and attributes in what 
category are we to place sensations or any other feel 
ings and states of mind as hope joy fear sound 
smell taste pain pleasure thought judgment con 
ception and the like probably all these would have 
been placed by the aristotelian school in the catego 
ries of actio and passio and the relation of such of 
them as are active to their objects and of such of 
them as are passive to their causes would rightly be 
so placed but the things themselves the feelings or 
states of mind wrongly feelings or states of con 
sciousness are assuredly to be counted among reali 
ties but they cannot be reckoned either among sub 
stances or attributes 

§ before recommencing imder better auspices 
the attempt made with such imperfect success by the 
great founder of the science of logic we must take 
notice of an unfortunate ambiguity in all the concrete 
names which correspond to the most general of all 
abstract terms the word existence when we have 
occasion for a name which shall be capable of de 
noting whatever exists as contradistinguished from 
nonentity or nothing there is hardly a word appli 
cable to the purpose which is not also and even more

in one of its meanings is exactly equivalent to the 
verb esnst and therefore suitable even by its gram 
matical formation to be the concrete of the abstract 
existence but this word strange as the fact may 
appear is still more completely spoiled for the pur 
pose which it seemed expressly made for than the 
word thing being is by custom exactly synony

should perhaps be suspected of thinking with some of 
the ancients that the cardinal virtues are animftlfl or 
at the least of holding with the platonic school the 
doctrine of selfexistent ideas or with the followers of 
epicurus that of sensible forms which detach them 
selves in every direction from bodies and by coming 
in contact with our organs cause our perceptions 
we should be supposed in short to believe that 
attributes are substances 

in consequence of this perversion of the word 
being philosophers looking about for something to 
supply its place laid their hands upon the word 
entity a piece of barbarous latin invented by the 
schoolmen to be used as an abstract name in which 
class its grammatical form would seem to place it but 
being seized by logicians in distress to stop a leak in 
their terminology it has ever since been used as a 
concrete name the kindred word essence bom at 
the same time and of the same parents scarcely 
imderwent a more complete transformation when 
from being the abstract of the verb to he it came to 
denote something sufficiently concrete to be inclosed 
in a glass bottle the word entity since it settled 
down into a concrete name has retained its univer 
sality of signification somewhat less unimpaired than 
any of the names before mentioned yet the same 
gradual decay to which after a certain age all the 
language of psychology seems liable has been at 
work even here if you call virtue an entityj you are 
indeed somewhat less strongly suspected of believing 
it to be a substance than if you called it a being but 
you are by no means free from the suspicion every 
word which was originally intended to connote mere 
existence seems after a time to enlarge its connota 
tion to separate existence or existence freed from the

condition of belonging to a substance which con 
dition being precisely what constitutes an attribute 
attributes are gradually shut out and along with them 
feelings which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred 
have no other name than that of the attribute which 
is grounded upon them strange that when the 
greatest embarrassment felt by all who have any con 
siderable number of thoughts to express is to find a 
sufficient variety of words fitted to express them 
thiere should be no practice to which even philoso 
phers are more addicted than that of taking valuable 
words to express ideas which are sufficiently expressed 
by other words already appropriated to them

next best thing is to imderstand thoroughly the defects 
of those we have i have therefore warned the reader

one of the above terms being altogether ambiguous i 
shall not confine myself to any one but shall employ 
on each occasion the word which seems least likely in 
the particular case to lead to a misunderstanding of 
my meaning nor do i pretend to use either these or 
any other words with a rigorous adherence to one 
single sense to do so would often leave us without 
a word to express what is signified by a known word 
in some one or other of its senses unless authors had 
an unlimited license to coin new words together with 
what it would be more difficult to assume unlimited 
power of making their readers adopt them nor 
would it be wise in a writer on a subject involving so 
much of abstraction to deny himself the advantage 
derived from even an improper use of a term when

were by a flash 

the diflsculty both to the writer and reader of the 
attempt which must be made to use vague words so as 
to convey a precise meaning is not wholly a matter of 
regret it is not unfitting that logical treatises should 
afford an example of that to facilitate which is among 
the most important uses of logic philosophical ian 
guage will for a long time and popular language perhaps 
always retain so much of vagueness and ambiguity 
that logic would be of little value if it did not among 
its other advantages exercise the understanding in 
doing its work neatly and correctly with these imper 
fect tools 

after this preamble it is time to proceed to our 
enumeration we shall commence with feeungs the 
simplest class of nameahle thmgs the term feeling 
being of course understood in its most enlarged sense 

i feelings or states of consciousness 

 a feeling and a state of consciousness are 
in the language of philosophy equivalent expressions 
everything is a feeling of which the mind is con 
scions everything which it feels or in other words 
which forms a part of its own sentient existence in 
popular language feeling is not always synonymous 
with state of consciousness being often taken more 
peculiarly for those states which are conceived as 
belonging to the sensitive or to the emotional phasis 
of our nature and sometimes with a still narrower 
restriction to the emotional alone as distinguished 
from what are conceived as belonging to the per 
cipient or intellectual phasis but this is an ad 
mitted departure from correctness of language just

as by a popular perversion the exact converse of this 
the word mind is withdrawn from its rightful gene 
rality of signification and restricted to the intellect 
the still greater perversion by which feeling is some 
times confined not only to bodily sensations but to 
the sensations of a single sense that of touch needs 
not be more particularly adverted to 

feeling in the proper sense of the term is a 
genus of which sensation emotion and thought are 
subordinate species under the word thought is here 
to be included whatever we are internally conscious of 
when we are said to think from the consciousness 
we have when we think of a red colour without hav 
ing it before our eyes to the most recondite thoughts 
of a philosopher or poet be it remembered how 
ever that by a thought is to be understood what 
passes in the mind itself and not any object external 
to the mind which the person is commonly said to be 
thinking of he may be thinking of the sun or of 
god but the sun and god are not thoughts his 
mental image however of the sun and his idea of 
god are thoughts states of his mind not of the 
objects themselves and so also is his beuef of the 
existence of the sun or of god or his disbelief if the 
case be so even imaginary objects which are said 
to exist only in our ideas are to be distinguished 
from our ideas of them i may think of a hobgoblin 
as i may think of the loaf which was eaten yesterday 
or of the flower which will bloom tomorrow but 
the hobgoblin which never existed is not the same 
thing with my idea of a hobgoblin any more than the 
loaf which once existed is the same thing with my 
idea of a loaf or the flower which does not yet exist 
but which will exist is the same with my idea of a

thought though at the present time all the objects 
are alike nonexistent 

in like manner a sensation is to be carefully dis 
tinguished from the object which causes the sensation 
our sensation of white from a white object nor is it 
less to be distinguished from the attribute whiteness 
which we ascribe to the object in consequence of its 
exciting the sensation unfortunately for clearness 
and due discrimination in considering these subjects 
our sensations seldom receive separate names we 
have a name for the objects which produce in us a 
certain sensation the word white we have a name 
for the quality in those objects to which we ascribe 
the sensation the name whiteness but when we 
speak of the sensation itself as we have not occasion 
to do this often except in our philosophical specula 
tions language which adapts itself for the most part 
only to the common uses of life has provided us with 
no singleworded or immediate designation we must 
employ a circumlocution and say the sensation of 
white or the sensation of whiteness we must denomi 
nate the sensation either from the object or from the 
attribute by which it is excited yet the sensation 
though it never does might very well be conceived to 
exist without anything whatever to excite it we can 
conceive it as arising spontaneously in the mind but 
if it so arose we should have no name to denote it which 
would not be a misnomer in the case of our sensations 
of hearing we are better provided we have the word 
sound and a whole vocabulary of words to denote the 
various kinds of soimds for as we are often con 
scious of these sensations in the absence of any per 
ceptihle object we can more easily conceive having them 
in the absence of any object whatever we need only

selves hearing them and what is easily conceived 
separately easily obtains a separate name but in 
general our names of sensations denote indiscrimi 
nately the sensation and the attribute thus colour 
stands for the sensations of white red c but also 
for the quauty in the coloured object we talk of 
the colours of things as among their properties 

 in the case of sensations another distinction 
has also to be kept in view which is often confounded 
and never without mischievous consequences this 
is the distinction between the sensation itself and the 
state of the bodily organs which precedes the sensa 
tion and which constitutes the physical agency by 
which it is produced one of the sources of confu 
sion on this subject is the division commonly made of 
feelings into bodily and mental philosophically 
speaking there is no foundation at all for this distinc 
tion even sensations are states of the sentient mind 
not states of the body as distinguished from it what 
i am conscious of when i see the colour blue is a 
feeling of blue colour which is one thing the picture 
on my retina or the phenomenon of hitherto myste 
rious nature which takes place in my optic nerve or 
in my brain is another thing of which i am not at 
all conscious and which scientific investigation alone 
could have apprised me of these are states of my 
body but the sensation of blue which is the conse 
quence of these states of body is not a state of body 
that which perceives and is conscious is called mind 
when sensations are called bodily feelings it is only 
as being the class of feeungs which are immediately 
occasioned by bodily states whereas the other kinds 
of feelings thoughts for instance or emotions are

immediately excited not by anything acting upon the 
bodily organs but by sensations or by previous 
thoughts this however is a distinction not in 
our feelings but in the agency which produces our 
feelings all of them when actuauy produced are 
states of mind 

besides the affection of our bodily organs from 
without and the sensation thereby produced in our 
minds many writers admit a third link in the chain of 
phenomena which they term a perception and which 
consists in the recognition of an external object as the 
exciting cause of the sensation this perception 
ihey say is an act of the mind proceeding from its 
own spontaneous activity while in sensation the mind 
is passive being merely acted upon by the outward 
object and according to some philosophers it is by 
an act of the mind similar to perception except in 
not being preceded by any sensation that we recog 
nise the existence of god of the soul and other 
hyperphysical realities 

these acts of perception whatever be the conclu 
sion ultimately come to respecting their nature must 
i conceive take their place among the varieties of 
feelings or states of mind in so classing them i 
have not the smallest intention of declaring or insinu 
ating any theory as to the law of mind in which these 
mental processes may be supposed to originate or 
the conditions under which they may be legitimate or 
the reverse far less do i mean as mr whewell 
seems to suppose must be meant in an analogous 
case to indicate that as they are merely states of 
mind it is superfluous to inquire into their distin 
guishing pecuuarities i abstain from the inquiry as

and the conditions under which it is legitimate are 
a subject which as we have already so often remarked 
belongs not to logic but to the higher or transcendental 
branch of metaphysics 

to the same region of speculation belongs all 
that can be said respecting the distinction which 
the german metaphysicians and their french and 
english followers among whom mr whewell is one 
of the most distinguished so elaborately draw between 
the acts of the mind and its merely passive states

the crude materials of its experience i am aware 
that with reference to the view which those writers 
take of the primary elements of thought and know 
ledge this distinction is fundamental but for our 
purpose which is to examine not the original ground 
work of our knowledge but how we come by that por 
tion of it which is not original the difference between 
active and passive states of mind is of secondary 
importance for us they all are states of mind they 
all are feelings by which let it be said once more i

the mind and to be carefully distinguished from the 
external or physical facts with which they may be 
connected either as effects or as causes 

§ among active states of mind there is however 
one species which merits particular attention because 
it forms a principal part of the connotation of some 
important classes of names i mean volitions or acts 
of the will when we speak of sentient beings by 
relative names a large portion of the connotation of 
the name usually consists of the actions of those 
beings actions past present and possible or probable 
future take for instance the words sovereign and 
subject what meaning do these words convey but 
that of innumerable actions done or to be done by 
the sovereign and the subjects to or in regard to one 
another reciprocally so with the words physician 
and patient leader and follower master and servant 
in many cases the words also connote actions which 
would be done under certain contingencies by persons 
other than those denoted as the words mortgagor 
and mortgagee obligor and obligee and many other 
words expressive of legal relation which connote what 
a court of justice would do to enforce the legal obli 
gation if not fulfilled there are also words which 
connote actions previously done by persons other than 
those denoted either by the name itself or by its 
correlative as the word brother from these in 
stances it may be seen how large a portion of the 
connotation of names consists of actions now what 
is an action not one thing but a series of two 
things the state of mind called a volition followed 
by an effect the volition or intention to produce 
the effect is one thing the effect produced in con 
sequence of the intention is another thing the two

§ of the first leading division of nameable 
things viz feelings or states of consciousness we 
began by recognising three subdivisions sensations 
thoughts and emotions the first two of these we 
have illustrated at considerable length the third 
emotions not being perplexed by similar ambiguities 
does not require similar exemplification and finally 
we have found it necessary to add to these three a 
fourth species commonly known by the name voli 
tions without seeking to prejudge the metaphysical 
question whether any mental state or phenomenon 
can be found which is not included in one or other of 
these four species it appears to me that the amount 
of illustration bestowed upon these may so far as we 
are concerned suflsce for the whole genus we shall 
therefore proceed to the two remaining classes of 
nameable things all things which are external to 
the mind being considered as belonging either to the 
class of substances or to that of attributes 

ii substances 

logicians have endeavoured to define substance 
and attribute but their definitions are not so much 
attempts to draw a distinction between the things 
themselves as instructions what difierence it is custo 
mary to make in the grammatical structure of the

sentence according as you are speaking of substances 
or of attributes such definitions are rather lessons 
of english or of greek latin or german than of 
mental philosophy an attribute say the school 
logicians must be the attribute something colour 
for example must be the colour of something good 
ness must be the goodness of something and if this 
something should cease to exist or should cease to be 
connected with the attribute the existence of the 
attribute would be at an end a substance on the 
contrary is selfexistent in speaking about it we 
need not put of after its name a stone is not the 
stone anything the moon is not the moon any 
thing but simply the moon unless indeed the 
name which we choose to give to the substance be a 
relative name if so it must be followed either by 
or by some other particle implying as that preposi 
tion does a reference to something else but then the 
other characteristic peculiarity of an attribute would 
fail the something might be destroyed and the 
substance might still subsist thus a father must be 
the father of something and so far resembles an 
attribute in being referred to something besides 
himself if there were no child there would be no 
father but this when we look into the matter only 
means that we should not call him father the man 
called father might still exist though the child were 
annihilated and there would be no contradiction in 
supposing him to exist although the whole universe 
except himself were destroyed but destroy all white 
substances and where would be the attribute white 
ness whiteness without any white thing is a 
contradiction in terms 

this is the nearest approach to a solution of the 
difficulty that will be found in the common treatises

on logic it will scarcely be thought to be a satis 
factory one if an attribute is distinguished from a 
substance by being the attribute of something it 
seems highly necessary to understand what is meant 
by of a particle which needs explanation too much 
itself to be placed in front of the explanation of 
anything else and as for the selfexistence of sub 
stances it is very true that a substance may be con 
ceived to exist without any other substance but so 
also may an attribute without any other attribute 
and we can no more imagine a substance without 
attributes than we can imagine attributes without a 
substance 

metaphysicians however have probed the ques 
tion deeper and givea an account of substance 
considerably more satisfactory than this substances 
are usually distinguished as bodies or minds of 
each of these philosophers have at length provided 
us with a definition which seems unexceptionable 

 a body according to the received doctrine of 
modem metaphysicians may be defined the external 
cause to which we ascribe our sensations when i see 
and touch apiece of gold i am conscious of a sensation 
of yellow colour and sensations of hardness and weight 
and by varying the mode of handling i may add to 
these sensations many others completely distinct from 
them the sensations are all of which i am directly 
conscious but i consider them as produced by some 
thing not only existing independently of my will but 
external to my bodily organs and to my mind this 
external something i call a body 

it may be asked how come we to ascribe our 
sensations to any external cause and is there sufis 
cient ground for so ascribing them it is known that

there are metaphysicians who have raised a contro 
versy on the point maintaming the paradox that we 
are not warranted in referring our sensations to a 
cause such as we understand by the word body or to 
any cause whatever unless indeed the first cause 
though we have no concern here with this contro 
versy nor with the metaphysical niceties on which it 
tums one of the best ways of showing what is meant 
by substance is to consider what position it is neces 
sary to take up in order to maintain its existence 
against opponents 

it is certain then that a part of our notion of a 
body consists of the notion of a number of sensations 
of our own or of other sentient beings habitually 
occurring simultaneously my conception of the table 
at which i am writing is compounded of its visible 
form and size which are complex sensations of sight 
its tangible form and size which are complex sensa 
tions of our organ of touch and of our muscles its 
weight which is also a sensation of touch and of the 
muscles its colour which is a sensation of sight its 
hardness which is a sensation of the muscles its 
composition which is another word for all the va 
rieties of sensation which we receive under various 
circumstances from the wood of which it is made and 
so forth all or most of these various sensations 
frequently are and as we learn by experience always 
might be experienced simultaneously or in many 
different orders of succession at our own choice and 
hence the thought of any one of them makes us think 
of the others and the whole become mentally amal 
gated into one mixed state of consciousness which 
in the language of the school of locke and hartley is 
termed a complex idea 

now there are philosophers who have argued as

existence seems to rest on the evidence of the senses 
but to the senses nothing is apparent except the 
sensations we know indeed that these sensations 
are bound together by some law they do not come 
together at random but according to a systematic 
order which is part of the order established in the 
universe when we experience one of these sensations 
we usually experience the others also or know 
that we have it in our power to experience them 
but a fixed law of connexion making the sensations 
occur together does not say these philosophers 
necessarily require what is called a substratum to 
support them the conception of a substratum is 
but one of many possible forms in which that con 
nexion presents itself to our imagination a mode of 
as it were realizing the idea if there be such a 
substratum suppose it this instant annihilated by the 
fiat of omnipotence and let the sensations continue 
to occur in the same order and how would the 
substratum be missed by what signs should we be 
able to discover that its existence had terminated

it still existed as we now have and if we should not

physicians is not anything intrinsically different from 
the sensations which the body is said to produce in

these ingenious speculations have at no time in 
the history of philosophy made many proselytes but 
the controversies to which they have given rise and 
the doctrines which have been developed in the 
attempt to find a conclusive answer to them have 
been fruitful of important consequences to the science 
of mind the sensations it was answered which we 
are conscious of and which we receive not at random 
but joined together in a certain uniform manner 
imply not only a law or laws of connexion but a 
cause external to our mind which cause by its own 
laws determines the laws according to which the 
sensations are connected and experienced the 
schoolmen used to call this external cause by the 
name we have already employed a substratum and 
its attributes as they expressed themselves inhered 
literally stucky in it to this substratum the name 
matter is usually given in philosophical discussions 
it was soon however acknowledged by all who 
reflected on the subject that the existence of matter 
could not be proved by extrinsic evidence the 
answer therefore now usually made to berkeley and 
his followers is that the belief is intuitive that 
mankind in all ages have felt themselves compelled 
by a necessity of their nature to refer their sensations 
to an external cause that even those who deny it in 
theory yield to the necessity in practice and both in

speech thought and feeling do equally with the 
vulgar acknowledge their sensations to be the effects 
of something external to them this knowledge 
therefore is as evidently intuitive as oiu knowledge 
of our sensations themselves is intuitive and here

transcendental metaphysics to which science we 
leave it 

but although the extreme doctrine of the idealist 
metaphysicians that objects are nothing but our 
sensations and the laws which connect them has 
appeared to few subsequent thinkers to be worthy of 
assent the only point of much real importance is one

he allows that this representation the matter of which 
he says consists of our sensations though the form

our other feelings as body is the mysterious some 
thing which excites the mind to feel so mind is the

unnecessary to give in the case of mind as we gave

ni — attributes and first qualities 

§ from what has abeady been said of sub 
stance what is to be said of attribute is easily 
deducible for if we know not and cannot know 
anything of bodies but the sensations which they 
excite in us or others those sensations must be all 
that we can at bottom mean by their attributes 
and the distinction which we verbally make between 
the properties of things and the sensations we receive 
from them must originate in the convenience of dis 
course rather than in the nature of what is denoted 
by the terras 

attributes are usually distributed under the three 
heads of quality quantity and relation we shall 
come to the two latter presently in the first place 
we shall confine ourselves to the former 

let us take then as our example one of what 
are termed the sensible qualities of objects and let 
that example be whiteness when we ascribe white 
ness to any substance as for instance snow when 
we say that snow has the quality whiteness what do 
we really assert simply that when snow is present 
to our organs we have a particular sensation which 
we are accustomed to call the sensation of white 
but how do i know that snow is present obviously 
by the sensations which i derive from it and not 
otherwise i infer that the object is present because 
it gives me a certain assemblage or series of sensa 
tions and when i ascribe to it the attribute white 
ness my meaning is only that of the sensations 
composing this group or series that which i call the 
sensation of white colour is one 

this is one view which may be taken of the 
subject but there is also another and a difierent 

g google 



 names and propositions 

view it may be said that it is tnie we know nothing 
of sensible objects except the sensations they excite 
in us that the fact of ovir receiving from snow the 
particular sensation which is called a sensation of 
white is the ground on which we ascribe to that sub 
stance the quality whiteness the sole proof of its 
possessing that quality but because one thing may 
be the sole evidence of the existence of another thing 
it does not follow that the two are one and the same 
the attribute whiteness it may be said is not the 
fact of our receiving the sensation but something in 
the object itself a power inherent in it something in 
virtue of which the object produces the sensation 
and when we affirm that snow possesses the attribute 
whiteness we do not merely assert that the presence 
of snow produces in us that sensation but that it 
does so through and by reason of that power or 
quality 

for the purposes of logic it is not of material 
importance which of these views we adopt the full 
discussion of the subject belongs to the department of 
inquiry so often alluded to under the name of the 
higher metaphysics but it may be said here that for 
the doctrine of the existence of a peculiar species of 
entities called qualities i can see no foundation except 
in a tendency of the human mind which is the cause 
of many delusions i mean the disposition wherever 
we meet with two names which are not precisely syno 
nymous to suppose that they must be the names of 
two diflferent things whereas in reality they may be 
names of the same thing viewed in two different 
lights which is as much as to say under different 
suppositions as to surrounding circumstances be 
cause quality and sensation cannot be put indiscrimi 
nately one for the other it is supposed that they

cannot both signify the same thing namely the 
impression or feeling with which we are affected 
through our senses by the presence of an object 
although there is at least no absurdity in supposing 
that this identical impression or feeling may be called 
a sensation when considered merely in itself and a 
quality when regarded as emanating from any one 
of the numerous objects the presence of which to ovir 
organs excites in our minds that among various other 
sensavions or feelings and if this be admissible as a 
supposition it rests with those who contend for an 
entity pet se called a quality to show that their 
opinion is preferable or is anything in fact but a 
lingering remnant of the scholastic doctrine of occult 
causes the very absurdity which moliere so happily 
ridiculed when he made one of his pedantic physicians 
account for the fact that topium endormit by the 
maxim parcequil a une verlu soporifique 

it v evident that when the physician stated that 
opium had une vertu soporifique he did not 
account for but merely asserted over again the fact 
that it endormit in like manner when we say that 
snow is white because it has the quality of whiteness 
we are only reasserting in more technical language 
the fact that it excites in us the sensation of white 
if it be said that the sensation must have some cause 
i answer its cause is the presence of the object 
when wc have asserted that as often as the object is 
present and our organs in their normal state the 
sensation takes place we have stated all that we know 
about the matter there is no need after assigning 
a certain and intelligible cause to suppose an occult 
cause besides for the purpose of enabling the real 
cause to produce its effect if i am asked why does

and to this we must at last come even after interpo 
lating the imaginary entity whatever number of 
links the chain of causes and effects may consist of 
how any one link produces the one which is next to 
it remains equally inexplicable to us it is as easy to 
comprehend that the object should produce the sensa 
tion directly and at once as that it should produce 
the same sensation by the aid of something else called 
the power of producing it

and shall for the purposes of logic adopt a language 
compatible with either view of the nature of qudities 
i shall say — what at least admits of no dispute — that 
the quality of whiteness ascribed to the object snow 
is grounded upon its exciting in us the sensation of 
white and adopting the language already used by 
the school logicians in the case of the kind of attri 
butes called relations i shall term the sensation of 
white the foundation of the quality whiteness for 
logical purposes the sensation is the only essential 
part of what is meant by the word the only part 
which we ever can be concerned in proving when 
that is proved the quality is proved if an object 
excites a sensation it has of course the power of 
exciting it

iv relations 

 the qualities of a body we have said are 
the attributes grounded upon the sensations which the 
presence of that particular body to our organs excites 
in our minds but when we ascribe to any object the 
kind of attribute called a relation the foundation of 
the attribute must be something in which other objects 
are concerned besides itself and the percipient 

as there may with propriety be said to be a rela 
tion between any two things to which two correlative 
names are or may be given we may expect to dis 
cover what constitutes a relation in general if we 
enumerate the principal cases in which mankind have 
imposed correlative names and observe what all these 
cases have iii common 

what then is the character which is possessed in 
common by states of circumstances so heterogeneous 
and discordant as these one thing tike another one 
thing unlike another one thing near another one 
thing ar from another one thing before after y along 
with another one thing greater equal less than ano 
ther one thing the cause of another the effect of 
another one person the master servant y childy parent 
husbandy unfe sovereign subject attorney y clienty of 
another and so on 

omitting for the present the case of resemblance 
a relation which requires to be considered separately 
there seems to be one thing common to all these cases 
and only one that in each of them there exists or 
occurs or has existed or occurred some act or phe 
nomenon into which the two things which are said to 
be related to each other both enter as parties con 
cerned this fact or phenomenon is what the aris 
totelian logicians called the fundamentum relationis

 names and proposition 

thus in the relation of greater and less between two 
magnitudes the fundamentum relationis is the fact that 
when one of the two magnitudes is applied to the 
other it more than covers it and cannot by any new 
arrangement of parts be entirely brought within the 
boundaries of the other object in the relation of 
master and servant the fundamentum relationis is the 
fact that the one has undertaken or is compelled to 
perform certain services for the benefit and at the 
bidding of the other in that of husband and wife 
the fundamentum relationis consists of the facts 
that the parties are a man and a woman that they 
have promised certain things with certain formali 
ties and are in consequence invested by the law 
with certain rights and subjected to certain duties 
examples might be indefinitely multiplied but it is 
already obvious that whenever two things are said to 
be related there is some fact or series of facts into 
which they both enter and that whenever any two 
things are involved in some one fact or series of 
facts we may ascribe to those two things a mutual 
relation grounded on the fact even if they have 
nothing in common but what is common to all things 
that they are members of the universe we call that a 
relation and denominate them fellowcreatures fellow 
beings or fellowdenizens of the universe but in 
proportion as the fact into which the two objects enter 
as parts is of a more special and peculiar cur of a more 
complicated nature so also is the relation grounded 
upon it and there are as many conceivable relations 
as there are conceivable kinds of fact in which two 
things can be jointly concerned 

in the same manner therefore as a quality is an 
attribute grounded upon the fact that a certain sensa 
tion or sensations are produced in us by the object 

digitized by vjooq ic 



things denoted by names 

so an attribute groudded upon some fact into which 
the object enters jointly with another object is a rela 
tion between it and that other object but the fact in 
the latter case consists of the very same kind of ele 
ments as the fact in the former namely states of 
consciousness in the case last cited for example 
the relation of husband and wife the fundamentum 
reuuionis consists entirely of thoughts emotions sen 
sations and volitions actual or contingent either of 
the parties themselves or of other parties concerned 
in the same series of transactions as for instance 
the intentions which would be formed by a judge in 
case a complaint were made to his tribunal of the in 
fringement of any of the legal obligations imposed by 
marriage and the acts which the judge would per 
form in consequence acts being as we have already 
seen another word for intentions followed by an 
effect and that effect again being but another word 
for sensations or some other feelings occasioned 
either to oneself or to somebody else there is no 
part whatever of what the names expressive of the 
relation imply that is not resolvable into states of con 
sciousness outward objects being no doubt supposed 
throughout as the causes by which some of those 
states of consciousness are excited and minds as the 
subjects by which all of them are experienced but 
neither the external objects nor the minds making 
their existence known otherwise than by the states of 
consciousness 

cases of relation are not always so complicated as 
that to which we last alluded the simplest of all 
cases of relation are those expressed by the words 
antecedent and consequent and by the word simul 
taneous if we say for instance that dawn preceded 
sunrise the fact in which the two things dawn and 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

sunrise were jointly concerned consisted only of the 
two things themselves no third thing entered into 
the fact or phenomenon at au unless indeed we 
choose to call the succession of the two objects a third 
thing but their succession is not something added to 
the things themselves it is something involved in 
them dawn and sunrise announce themselves to our 
consciousness by two successive sensatimis our con 
sciousness of the succession of these sensations is not 
a third sensation or feding added to them we have 
not first the two feelings and then a feeling of their 
succession to have two feelings at all implies having 
them either successively or else simultaneously 
sensations or other feelings being given succession 
and simultaneousness are the two conditions to the 
alternative of which they are subjected by the nature 
of our faculties and no one has been able or needs 
expect to analyze the matter any farther 

§ in a somewhat similar position are two other 
sorts of relation likeness and unlikeness i have 
two sensations we will suppose them to be simple 
ones two sensations of white or one sensation of 
white and another of black i call the first two 
sensations like the last two unlike what is the fact 
or phenomenon constituting the fundamentum of this 
relation the two s ensations first and then what we 
call a feeling of resemblance or a feeling of want of 
resemblance let us confine ourselves to the former 
ease resemblance is evidently a feeling a state of 
the consciousness of the observer whether the 
feeling of the resemblance of the two colours be a 
third state of consciousness which i have after having 
the two sensations of colour or whether like the 
feeling of their succession it is involved in the sensa

tions themselves may be a matter of discussion but 
in either case these feelings of resemblance and of 
its opposite dissimilarity are parts of our nature 
and parts so far from being capable of analysis that 
they are presupposed in every attempt to analyse any 
of our other feelings likeness and unlikeness there 
fore as well as antecedence sequence and simulta 
neousness must stand apart among relations as things 
sui generis they are attributes grounded on facts 
that is on states of consciousness but on states 
which are peculiar unresolvable and inexplicable 

but although likeness or unlikeness cannot be 
resolved into anything else complex cases of likeness 
or unlikeness can be resolved into simpler ones 
when we say of two things which consist of parts 
that they are like one another the likeness of the 
whole does admit of analysis it is compounded of 
likenesses between the various parts respectively of 
how vast a variety of resemblances of parts must that 
resemblance be composed which induces us to say that 
a portrait or a landscape is like its original if one 
person mimics another with any success of bow many 
simple likenesses must the general or complex like 
ness be compounded likeness in a succession of 
bodily postures likeness in voice or in the accents 
and intonations of the voice likeness in the choice 
of words and in the thoughts or sentiments ex 
pressed whether by word countenance or gesture 

all likeness and unlikeness of which we have any 
cognizance resolve themselves into likeness and un 
likeness between states of our own or some other 
mind when we say that one body is like another 
since we know nothing of bodies but the sensations 
which they excite we mean really that there is a 
resemblance between the sensations excited by the

 names and propositions 

two bodies or between some portion at least of these 
sensations if we say that two attributes are like one 
another since we know nothing of attributes except 
the sensations or states of feeling on which they are 
grounded we mean really that those sensations or 
states of feeling resemble each other we may also say 
that two relations are alike the fact of resemblance 
between relations is sometimes called analogy y forming 
one of the numerous meanings of that word the 
relation in which priam stood to hector namely that 
of father and son resembles the relation in which 
philip stood to alexander resembles it so closely 
that they are called the same relation the relation 
in which cromwell stood to england resembles the 
relation in which napoleon stood to france though 
not so closely as to be called the same relation the 
meaning in both these instances must be that a 
resemblance existed between the facts which consti 
tuted iht fundamentum relationis 

this resemblance may exist in all conceivable 
gradations from perfect undistinguishableness to 
something very slight indeed when we say that a 
thought suggested to the mind of a person of genius 
is like a seed cast into the ground because the former 
produces a multitude of other thoughts and the latter 
a multitude of other seeds this is saying that between 
the relation of an inventive mind to a thought con 
tained in it and the relation of a fertile soil to a seed 
contained in it there exists a resemblance the real 
resemblance being in the two fundamenta relationis in 
each of which there occurs a germ producing by its 
developement a multitude of other things similar to 
itself and as whenever two objects are jointly 
concerned in a phenomenon this constitutes a rela 
tion between those objects so if we suppose a second

pair of objects concerned in a second phenomenon 
the slightest resemblance between the two phenomena 
is sufficient to admit of its being said that the two 
relations resemble provided of course the points of 
resemblance are found in those portions of the two 
phenomena respectively which are connoted by the 
relative names 

while speaking of resemblance it is necessary to 
take notice of an ambiguity of language against which 
scarcely any one is sufficiently on his guard resem 
blance when it exists in the highest degree of all 
amounting to undistinguishableness is often called 
identity and the two similar things are said to be the 
same i say often not always for we do not say 
that two visible objects two persons for instance are 
the same because they are so much alike that one 
might be mistaken for the other but we constantly 
use this mode of expression when speaking of feel 
ings as when i say that the sight of any object gives 
me the same sensation or emotion today that it did 
yesterday or the same which it gives to some other 
person this is evidently an incorrect application 
of the word sam for the feeling which i had yester 
day is gone never to return what i have today is 
another feeling exactly like the former perhaps but 
distinct from it and it is evident that two different 
persons cannot be experiencing the same feeling in 
the sense in which we say that they are both sitting 
at the same table by a similar ambiguity we say 
that two persons are ill of the same disease that two 
people hold the same office not in the sense in which 
we say that they are engaged in the same adventure 
or sailing in the same ship but in the sense that they 
fill offices exactly similar though perhaps in distant 
places great confusion of ideas is often produced

and many fallacies engendered in otherwise enlight 
ened understandings by not being sufficiently alive to 
the fact in itself not always to be avoided that they

tinction and to the ambiguity connected with it

tinguishable in their qualities not that the one building was pulled 
down and the other constructed with the materials whereas 
sameness in the primary sense does not even necessarily imply 
similarity for if we say of any man that he is greatly altered since 
such a time we understand and indeed imply by the very expres 
sion that he is one person though different in several qualities it 
is worth observing also that same in the secondary sense admits 
according to popular usage of degreee we speak of two things 
being nearly the same but not entirely personal identity does not 
admit of degrees nothing perhaps has contributed more to the 
error of realism than inattention to this ambiguity nen several

idea men overlooking the true simple statement of the case which 
is that they are all thinking alike look for something more abstruse

several relations generally called by other names 
are really cases of resemblance as for example 
equality which is but another word for the exact 
resemblance commonly called identity considered 
as subsisting between things in respect of their 
quantity and this example forms a suitable transit 
tion to the third and last of the three heads under 
which as already remarked attributes are commonly 
arranged 

v quantity 

 let us imagine two things between which 
there is no difference that is no dissimilarity except 
in quantity alone for instance a gallon of water and 
more than a gallon of water a gallon of water uke 
any other external object makes its presence known 
to us by a set of sensations which it excites ten 
gallons of water are also an external object making its 
presence known to us in a similar manner and as 
we do not mistake ten gallons of water for a gallon of 
water it is plain that the set of sensations is more 
or less different in the two cases in like manner a 
gallon of water and a gallon of madeira are two 
external objects making their presence known by two 
sets of sensations which sensations are different from 
each other in the first case however we say that 
the difference is in quantity in the last there is a 
difierence in quality while the quantity of the water 
and of the madeira is the same what is the real

distinction between the two cases it is not the 
province of logic to analyse it nor to decide whether 
it is susceptible of analysis or not for us the fol 
lowing considerations are sufficient it is evident 
that the sensations i receive from the gallon of 
water and those i receive from the gallon of madeira 
are not the same that is not precisely alike neither 
are they altogether unlike they are partly similar 
partly dissimilar and that in which they resemble is 
precisely that in which alone the gallon of water and 
the ten gallons do not resemble that in which the 
gallon of water and the gallon of wine are like each 
other and in which the gallon and the ten gallons of 
water are unlike each other is called their quantity 
this likeness and unlikeness i do not pretend to explain 
no more than any other kind of likeness or unlike 
ness but my object is to show that when we say of 
two things that they differ in quantity just as when 
we say that they differ in quality the assertion is 
always grounded upon a difference in the sensations 
which they excite nobody i presume will say 
that to see or to lift or to drink ten gallons of water 
does not include in itself a different set of sensations 
from those of seeing lifting or drinking one gallon 
or that to see or handle a footrule and to see or 
handle a yardmeasure made exactly like it are the 
same sensations i do not undertake to say what the 
difference in the sensations is everybody knows and 
nobody can tell no more than any one could tell what 
white is to a person who had never had the sensation 
but the difference so far as cognizable by our faculties 
lies in the sensations whatever difference we say 
there is in the things themselves is in this as in all 
other cases grounded and grounded exclusively on a 
difference in the sensations excited by them

vi attributes concluded 

§ thus then all the attributes of bodies 
which are classed imder quality or quantity are 
grounded upon the sensations which we receive from 
those bodies and may be defined the powers which 
the bodies have of exciting those sensations and 
the same general explanation has been found to 
apply to most of the attributes usually classed under 
the head of relation they too are grounded 
upon some fact or phenomenon into which the related 
objects enter as parts that fact or phenomenon 
having no meaning and no existence to us except 
the series of sensations or other states of con 
sciousness hy which it makes itself known and the 
relation being simply the power or capacity which the 
object possesses of taking part along with the cor 
related object in the production of that series of 
sensations or states of consciousness we have been 
obliged indeed to recognise a somewhat different 
character in certain peculiar relations those of suc 
cession and simultaneity of likeness and unlikeness 
these not being grounded on any fact or phenomenon 
distinct from the related objects themselves do not 
admit of the same kind of analysis but these 
relations though not like other relations grounded 
upon states of consciousness are themselves states of 
consciousness resemblance is nothing but our feeling 
of resemblance succession is nothing but our feeling 
of succession or if this be disputed and we cannot 
without transgressing the bounds of our science 
discuss it here at least our knowledge of these 
relations and even our possibility of knowledge is 
confined to those which subsist between sensations or 
other states of consciousness for though we ascribe 

vol i h t

 names and propositions 

resemblance or succession or simultaneity to objects 
and to attributes it is always in virtue of resemblance 
or succession or simultaneity in the sensations or 
states of consciousness which those objects excite and 
on which those attributes are grounded 

§ in the preceding investigation we have for 
the sake of simpucity considered bodies only and 
omitted minds but what we have said is appucable 
mutatis mutandis to the latter the attributes of 
minds as well as those of bodies are grounded upon 
states of feeling or consciousness but in the case of 
a mind we have to consider its own states as well as 
those which it produces in other minds every attri 
bute of a mind consists either in being itself affected 
in a certain way or affecting other minds in a certain 
way considered in itself we can predicate nothing 
of it but the series of its own feelings when we say 
of any mind that it is devout or superstitious or 
meditative or cheerful we mean that the ideas 
emotions or volitions implied in those words form a 
frequently recurring part of the series of feelings or 
states of consciousness which fill up the sentient 
existence of that mind 

in addition however to those attributes of a mind 
which are grounded upon its own states of feeling 
attributes may also be ascribed to it in the same 
manner as to a body grounded on the feelings which 
it excites in other minds a mind does not indeed 
like a body excite sensations but it may excite 
thoughts or emotions the most important example 
of attributes ascribed on this ground is the employ 
ment of terms expressive of approbation or blame 
when for example we say of any character or in 
other words of any mind that it is admirable we

things denoted by names 

mean that the contemplation of it excites the senti 
ment of admiration and indeed somewhat more 
for the word implies that we not only feel admiration 
but approve that sentiment in ourselves in some 
cases under the semblance of a single attribute two 
are really predicated one of them a state of the 
mind itself the other a state with which other 
minds are aflfected by thinking of it as when we say 
of any one that he is generous the word generosity 
expresses a certain fitate of mind but being a term of 
praise it also expresses that this state of mind excites 
in us another mental state called approbation the 
assertion made therefore is twofold and of the fol 
lowing purport certain feelings form habitually a part 
of this persons sentient existence and moreover 
the idea of those feelings of his excites the sentiment 
of approbation in ourselves or others 

as we thus ascribe attributes to minds on the 
ground of ideas and emotions so may we to bodies 
on similar grounds and not solely on the ground of 
sensations as in speaking of the beauty of a statue 
since this attribute is grounded upon the peculiar 
feeling of pleasure which the statue produces in our 
minds and which is not a sensation but an emotion 

vii general result 

 our survey of the varieties of things which 
have been or which are capable of being named — 
which have been or are capable of being either 
predicated of other things or made themselves the 
subject of predications — is now complete 

our enumeration commenced with feelings these 
we scrupulously distinguished from the objects which 
excite them and from the organs by which they are 

 



 names and propositions 

or may be supposed to be conveyed feelings are of 
four sorts sensations thoughts emotions and 
volitions what are called perceptions are merely a 
particular case of belief and belief is a kind of 
thought actions are merely volitions followed by an 
effect if there be any other kind of mental state not 
included under these subdivisions we did not think 
it necessary or proper in this place to discuss its 
existence or the rank which ought to be assigned 
to it 

after feelings we proceeded to substances 
these are either bodies or minds without entering 
into the grounds of the metaphysical doubts which 
have been raised concerning the existence of matter 
and mind as objective realities we stated as sufficient 
for us the conclusion in which the best thinkers are 
now very generally agreed that all we can know of 
matter is the sensations which it gives us and the 
order of occurrence of those sensations and that 
while the substance body is the unknown cause of 
our sensations the substance mind is the unknown 
percipient 

the only remaining class of nameable things is 
attributes and these are of three kinds quality 
relation and quantity qualities like substances 
are known to us no otherwise than by the sensations 
or other states of consciousness which they excite 
and while in compliance with common usage we have 
continued to speak of them as a distinct class of 
things we showed that in predicating them no one 
means to predicate anjrthing but those sensations or 
states of consciousness on which they may be said to 
be grounded and by which alone they can be defined 
relations except the simple cases of likeness and 
unlikeness succession and simultaneity are similarly

things denoted by names 

grounded upon some fact or phenomenon that is 
upon some series of sensations or states of conscious 
ness more or less complicated the third species 
of attribute quantity is also manifestly grounded 
upon something in our sensations or states of feel 
ing since there is an indubitable difference in the 
sensations excited by a larger and a smaller bulk 
or by a greater or a less degree of intensity in any 
object of sense or of consciousness all attributes 
therefore are to us nothing but either our sensations 
and other states of feeling or something inextricably 
involved therein and to this even the peculiar and 
simple relations just adverted to are not exceptions 
those peculiar relations however are so important 
and even if they might in strictness be classed among 
our states of consciousness are so fundamentally 
distinct from any other of those states that it would 
be a vain subtlety to confound them under that 
conmion head and it is necessary that they should be 
classed apart 

as the result therefore of our analysis we obtain 
the following as an enumeration and classification of 
all nameable things — 

st feelings or states of consciousness 

nd the minds which experience those feelings 

rd the bodies or external objects which excite 
certain of those feelings together with the powers or 
properties whereby they excite them these last being 
included rather in compliance with common opinion 
and because their existence is taken for granted in the 
common language from which i cannot prudently 
deviate than because the recognition of such powers 
or properties as real existences appears to me war 
ranted by a sound philosophy 

th and last the successions and coexistences 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

the likenesses and unlikenesses between feelings or 
states of consciousness those relations when con 
sidered as subsisting between other things exist in 
reality only between the states of consciousness which 
those things if bodies excite if minds either excite 
or experience 

this until a better can be suggested must serve 
us as a substitute for the abortive classification of 
existences termed the categories of aristotle the 
practical application of it will appear when we com 
mence the inquiry into the import of propositions in 
other words when we inquire what it is which the 
mind actually believes when it gives what is called its 
assent to a proposition 

these four classes comprising if the classification 
be correct all nameable things these or some of 
them must of course compose the signification of all 
names and of these or some of them is made up 
whatever we call a fact 

for distinctions sake every fact which is solely 
composed of feelings or states of consciousness con 
sidered as such is often called a psychological or 
subjective fact while every fact which is composed 
either wholly or in part of something different from 
these that is of substances and attributes is called 
an objective fact we may say then that every 
objective fact is grounded on a corresponding sub 
jective one and has no meaning to us apart from the 
subjective fact which corresponds to it except as a 
name for the unknown and inscrutable process by 
which that subjective or psychological fact is brought 
to pass

chapter iv 

of propositions 

f in treating of propositions as already in 
treating of names some considerations of a compara 
tively elementary nature respecting their form and 
varieties must be premised before entering upon that 
analysis of the import conveyed by them which is 
the real subject and purpose of this preliminary book 

a proposition we have before said is a portion of 
discourse in which a predicate is aflsrmed or denied of 
a subject a predicate and a subject are all that is 
necessarily required to make up a proposition but as 
we cannot conclude from merely seeing two names put 
together that they are a predicate and a subject that 
is that one of them is intended to be affirmed or denied 
of the other it is necessary that there should be some 
mode or form of indicating that such is the intention 
some sign to distinguish a predication from any other 
kind of discourse this is sometimes done by a 
slight alteration of one of the words called an in 
flearion as when we say fire burns the change of 
the second word from bum to bums showing that we 
mean to affirm the predicate burn of the subject fire 
but this function is more commonly fulfilled by the 
word is when an affirmation is intended is not when 
a negation or by some other part of the verb to be 
the word which thus serves the purpose of a sign of 
predication is called as we formerly observed the 
copula it is of the utmost importance that there 
should be no mdistinctness in our conception of the 
nature and office of the copula for confused notions

 names and propositions 

respecting it are among the causes which have spread 
mysticism over the field of logic and perverted its 
speculations into logomachies 

it is apt to be supposed that the copula is much 
more than a mere sign of predication that it also 
signifies existence in the proposition socrates is 
just it may seem to be implied not only that the 
quality wf can be affirmed of socrates but moreover 
that socrates w that is to say exists this how 
ever only shows that there is an ambiguity in the 
word is b word which not only performs the function 
of the copula in affirmations but has also a meaning 
of its own in virtue of which it may itself be made 
the predicate of a proposition that the employment 
of it as a copula does not necessarily include the 
affirmation of existence appears from such a proposi 
tion as this a centaur is a fiction of the poets 
where it cannot possibly be implied that a centaur 
exists since the proposition itself expressly asserts 
that the thing has no real existence 

many volumes might be filled with the fiivolous 
speculations concerning the nature of being ro v 
ovaia ens entitas essentia and the like which 
have arisen from overlooking this double meaning of 
the words to be from supposing that when it signifies 
to existy and when it signifies to be some specified 
thing as to be a man to be socrates to be seen or 
spoken of to be a phantom even to be a nonentity it 
must still at bottom answer to the same idea and 
that a meaning must be found for it which shall suit 
all these cases the fog which rose from this narrow 
spot diffused itself at an early period over the whole 
surface of metaphysics yet it becomes us not to 
triumph over the gigantic intellects tf plato and 
aristotle because we are now able to preserve ourselves

used as the vehicle of their thoughts is the practical 
lesson we learn respecting the ambiguities of words by 
finding that the same word in one language corre 
sponds on different occasions to different words in 
another when not thus exercised even the strongest 
understandings find it difficult to believe that things 
which have a common name have not in some respect 
or other a common nature and often expend much 
labour not only unprofitably but mischievously as 
was frequently done by the two philosophers just 
mentioned on vain attempts to discover in what this 
common nature consists but the habit once formed 
intellects much inferior are capable of detecting even 
ambiguities which are common to many languages 
and it is surprising that the one now under considera 
tion though it exists in the modem languages as well 
as in the ancient should have been overlooked by 
almost all authors the quantity of futile speculation 
which had been caused by a misapprehension of the 
nature of the copula was hinted at by hobbes but 
mr mill was i believe the first who distinctly 
characterized the ambiguity and pointed out how

has had to answer for it has indeed misled the 
moderns scarcely less than the ancients though their 
mistakes because our understandings are not yet so 
completely emancipated from their influence do not 
appear equally ridiculous 

we shall now briefly review the principal distinc 
tions which exist among propositions and the technical 
terms most commonly in use to express those dis 
tinctions 

 a proposition being a portion of discourse 
in which something is affirmed or denied of something 
the first division of propositions is into affirmative 
and negative an affirmative proposition is that in 
which the predicate is affirmed of the subject as 
caesar is dead a negative proposition is that in 
which the predicate is denied of the subject as 
caesar is not dead the copula in this last species 
of proposition consists of the words is not which are 
the sign of negation is being the sign of affirmation 

some logicians among whom may be mentioned 
hobbes state this distinction dififerently they recog 
nize only one form of copula is and attach the nega 
tive sign to the predicate caesar is dead and 
 caesar is not dead according to these writers are 
propositions agreeing not in the subject and predicate 
but in the subject only they do not consider 
dead but not dead to be the predicate of the 
second proposition and they accordingly define a 
negative proposition to be one in which the predicate 
is a negative name the point though not of much 
practical moment deserves notice as an example not 
unfrequent in logic where by means of an apparent 
simplification but which is merely verbal matters are 
made more complex than before the idea of these

propositions 

writers was that they could get rid of the distinction 
between affirming and denying by treating every case 
of denying as the affirming of a negative name but 
what is meant by a negative name a name expres 
sive of the absence of an attribute so that when we 
affirm a negative name what we are really predicating 
is absence and not presence we are asserting not that 
anything is but that something is not to express 
which operation no word seems so proper as the word 
denying the fundamental distinction is between a 
fact and the nonexistence of that fact between 
seeing something and not seeing it between caesars 
being dead and his not being dead and if this were a 
merely verbal distinction the generalization which 
brings both within the same form of assertion would 
be a real simplification the distinction however 
being real and in the facts it is the generalization 
confounding the distinction that is merely verbal and 
tends to obscure the subject by treating the difference 
between two kinds of truths as if it were only a dif 
ference between two kinds of words to put things 
together and to put them or keep them asunder will 
remain different operations whatever tricks we may 
play with language 

a remark of a similar nature may be appued to 
most of those distinctions among propositions which 
are said to have reference to their modality as differ 
ence of tense or time the sun did rise the sun is 
rising the sun mil rise all these difierences uke 
that between affirmation and negation might be 
glossed over by considering the incident of time as a 
mere modification of the predicate thus the sun is 
an object having risen the sun is an object notv rising 
the sun is on object to rise hereafter but the simpli 
fication would be merely verbal past present or 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

future do not constitute so maiiy different kinds of 
rising they are designations belonging to the event 
asserted to the suns rising today they aflfect not 
the predicate but the applicability of the predicate to 
the particular subject that which we affirm to be 
past present or future is not what the subject signi 
fies nor what the predicate signifies but specifically 
and expressly what the predication signifies what is 
expressed only by the proposition as such and not by 
either or both of the terms therefore the circum 
stance of time is properly considered as attaching to 
the copula which is the sign of predication and not 
to the predicate if the same cannot be said of such 
modifications as these caesar may be dead caesar is 
perhaps dead it is possible that caesar is dead it is 
only because these fall altogether under another head 
being properly assertions not of anything relating to 
the fact itself but of the state of our own mind in 
regard to it namely our absence of disbelief of it 
itius caesar may be dead means i am not sure 
that caesar is alive 

§ the next division of propositions is into 
simple and complex a simple proposition is that 
in which one predicate is affirmed or denied of one 
subject a complex proposition is that in which 
there is more than one predicate or more than one 
subject or both 

at first sight this decision has the air of an absur 
dity a solemn distinction of things into one and 
more than one as if we were to divide horses into 
single horses and teams of horses and it is true that 
what is called a complex proposition is often not a 
proposition at all but several propositions held toge 
ther by a conjunction sucly for example is this

propositions 

caesar is deadi and brutus is alive or even this 
caesar is dead but brutus is alive there are here 
two distinct assertions and we might as well call a 
street a complex house as these two propositions a 
complex proposition it is true that the smcategore 
matic words and and but have a meaning but that 
meaning is so far from making the two propositions 
one that it adds a third proposition to them all 
particles are abbreviations and generally abbreviations 
of propositions a kind of shorthand whereby that 
which to be expressed fully would have required a 
proposition or a series of propositions is suggested to 
the mind at once thus the words caesar is dead 
and brutus is alive are equivalent to these caesar is 
dead brutus is alive it is my wish that the two pre 
ceding propositions should be thought of together if 
the words were caesar is dead but brutus is alive the 
sense would be equivalent to the same three propo 
sitions together with a fourth between the two 
preceding propositions there exists a contrast viz 
either between the two facts themselves or between 
the feelings with which it is my wish that they should 
be regarded 

in the instances cited the two propositions are 
kept visibly distinct each subject having its separate 
predicate and each predicate its separate subject 
for brevity however and to avoid repetition the pro 
positions are often blended together as in this 
 peter and james preached at jerusalem and in gali 
lee which contains four propositions peter preached 
at jerusalem peter preached in galilee james 
preached at jerusalem james preached in galilee 

we have seen that when the two or more propo 
sitions comprising what is called a complex propo 
sition are stated absolutely and not under any

 names and propositions 

condition or proviso it is not a proposition at all 
but a plurality of propositions since what it expresses 
is not a single assertion but several assertions which 
if true when joined are true also when separated 
but there is a kind of proposition which although it 
contains a plurality of subjects and of predicates and 
may be said in one sense of the word to consist of 
several propositions contains but one assertion and 
its truth does not at all imply that of the simple pro 
positions which compose it an example of this is 
when the simple propositions are connected by the 
particle or as either a is b or c is d or by the 
particle if as a is b if c is d in the former case 
the proposition is called disjunctiv€y in the latter 
conditional the name hypothetical was originally 
common to both as has been well remarked by 
archbishop whately and others the disjunctive form 
is resolvable into the conditional every disjunctive 
proposition being equivalent to two or more condi 
tional ones either a is b or c is d means 
 if a is not b c is d and if c is not d a is b 
all hypothetical propositions therefore though dis 
junctive in form are conditional in meaning and the 
words hypothetical and conditional may be as indeed 
they generally are used synonymously propositions 
in which the assertion is not dependent upon a condi 
tion are said in the language of logicians to be 
categorical 

an hypothetical proposition is not like the pre 
tended complex propositions which we previously 
considered a mere aggregation of simple propositions 
the simple propositions which form part of the words 
in which it is couched form no part of the assertion 
which it conveys when we say if the koran comes 
from god mahomet is the prophet of god we do not

propositions 

intend to affirm either that the koran does come from 
god or that mahomet is really his prophet neither 
of these simple propositions may be true and yet the 
truth of the hypothetical proposition may be indis 
putable what is asserted is not the truth of either 
of the propositions but the inferribility of the one 
from the other what then is the subject and what 
the predicate of the hypothetical proposition the 
koran is not the subject of it nor is mahomet 
for nothing is affirmed or denied either of the koran 
or of mahomet the real subject of the predication 
is the entire proposition mahomet is the prophet of 
god and the affirmation is that this is a legitimate 
inference from the proposition the koran comes 
from god the subject and predicate therefore of 
an hypothetical proposition are names of propositions 
the subject is some one proposition the predicate 
is a general relative name applicable to propositions 
of this form — an inference from so and so a 
fresh instance is here aflforded of the remark that all 
particles are abbrenations since ijf a isb c isd 
is found to be an abbreviation of the following the 
proposition c is d is a legitimate inference from the 
proposition a is b 

the distinction therefore between hypothetical 
and categorical propositions is not so great as it at 
first appears in the conditional as well as in the 
categorical form one predicate is affirmed of one 
subject and no more but a conditional proposition 
is a proposition concerning a proposition the subject 
of the assertion is itself an assertion nor is this a 
property peculiar to hypothetical propositions there 
are other classes of assertions concerning propositions 
like other things a proposition has attributes which 
may be predicated of it the attribute predicated of

 names and propositions 

it in an hypothetical proposition is that of being in 
inference from a certain other proposition but this 
s only one of many attributes that might be predi 
cated we may say that the whole is greater than 
its part is an axiom in mathematics that the holy 
ghost proceeds from the father alone is a tenet of 
the greek church the doctrine of the divine right 
of kings was renounced by parliament at the revolu 
tion the infallibility of the pope has no countenance 
from scripture in all these cases the subject of the 
predication is an entire proposition that which these 
different predicates are affirmed of is the proposition y 
 the whole is greater than its part the propositiouy 
 the holy ghost proceeds from the father alone 
the proposition kings have a divine right the 
proposition the pope is infallible 

seeing then that there is much less difference 
between hjrpothetical propositions and any others 
than one might be led to imagine from their form 
we should be at a loss to account for the conspicuous 
position which they have been selected to fill in 
treatises on logic if we did not remember that what 
they predicate of a proposition namely its being an 
inference from something else is precisely that one of 
its attributes with which most of all a logician is 
concerned 

 the next of the common divisions of propo 
sitions is into universal particular indefinite and 
singular a distinction founded upon the degree of 
generality in which the name which is the subject of 
the proposition is to be understood the following 
are examples

propositions 

all men are mortal — universal 

some men are mortal — particular 

man is mortal — indefinite 

julii ccesar is mortal — singular 
the proposition is singular when the subject is 
an individual name the individual name needs not 
be a proper name the founder of christianity 
was crucified is as much a singular proposition as 
 christ was crucified 

when the name which is the subject of the 
proposition is a general name we may intend to 
affirm or deny the predicate either of all the things 
that the subject denotes or only of some when the 
predicate is affirmed or denied of all and each of the 
things denoted by the subject the proposition is uni 
versa when of some nonassignable portion of them 
only it is particular thus all men are mortal every 
man is mortal are universal propositions no man 
is inmiortal is also an universal proposition since the 
predicate immortal is denied of each and every 
individual denoted by the term man the negative 
proposition being exactly equivalent to the following 
every man is notimmortal but some men are 
wise some men are not wise are particular 
propositions the predicate loise being in the one case 
affirmed and in the other denied not of each and 
every individual denoted by the term man but only 
of each and every one of some portion of those indi 
viduals without specifying what portion for if this 
were specified the proposition would be changed 
either into a singular proposition or into an universal 
proposition with a different subject as for instance 
• all instructed men are wise there are other forms 
of particular propositions as most men are incapable 
of selfgovernment it being immaterial how large a 
vol i r t

 names and propositions 

portion of the subject the predicate is asserted of as 
long as it is left uncertain how that portion is to be 
distinguished from the rest 

when the form of the expression does not clearly 
show whether the general name which is the subject 
of the proposition is meant to stand for all the indi 
viduals denoted by it or only for some of them the 
proposition is commonly called indefinite but this 
as archbishop whately observes is a solecism of the 
same nature as that committed by some grammarians 
when in their list of genders they enumerate the 
doubtful gender the speaker must mean to assert 
the proposition either as an universal or as a particular 
proposition though he has failed to declare which 
and it often happens that though the words do not 
show which of the two he intends the context or the 
custom of speech supplies the deficiency thus 
when it is affirmed that man is mortal nobody 
doubts that the assertion is intended of all human 
beings and the word indicative of universality is com 
monly omitted only because the meaning is evident 
without it 

when a general name stands for each and every 
individual which it is a name of or in other words 
which it denotes it is said by logicians to be distri 
buted or taken distributively thus in the propo 
sition all men are mortal the subject man is 
distributed because mortality is affirmed of each and 
every man the predicate mortal is not distributed 
because the only mortals who are spoken of in the 
proposition are those who happen to be men while 
the word may for aught that appears and in feet 
does comprehend under it an indefinite number of 
objects besides men in the proposition some men 
are mortal both the predicate and the subject are

propositions 

undistributed in the following no men are perfect 
both the predicate and subject are distributed not 
only is the attribute perfection denied of the entire 
class man but that class is severed and cast out from 
the whole of the class perfect and not merely from 
some part of that class 

this phraseology which is of great service in 
stating and demonstrating the rules of the syllogism 
enables us to express very concisely the definitions of 
an universal and a particular proposition an uni 
versal proposition is that of which the subject is 
distributed a particular proposition is that of which 
the subject is undistributed 

there are many more distinctions among pro 
positions than those we have here stated some of 
them of considerable importance but for explaining 
and illustrating these more suitable opportunities will

chapter v 
of the import of prorositions 

§ an inquiry into the nature of propositions 
must have one of two objects to analyze the state 
of mind called belief or to analyze what is believed 
all language recognizes a difference between a doctrine 
or opinion and the act of entertaining the opinion 
between assent and what is assented to 

loc according to the conception here formed 
of it has no concern with the nature of the act of 
judging or believing the consideration of that act 
as a phenomenon of the mind belongs to another 
science philosophers however from descartes 
downwards and especially from the era of leibnitz 
and locke have by no means observed this dis 
tinction and would have treated with great disre 
spect any attempt to analyze the import of pro 
positions unless founded upon an analysis of the 
act of judgment a proposition they would have 
said is but the expression in words of a judgment 
the thing expressed not the mere verbal expression 
is the important matter when the mind assents to 
a proposition it judges let us find out what the 
mind does when it judges and we shall know what 
propositions mean and not otherwise 

conformably to these views almost all the writers 
on logic in the last two centuries whether english 
german or french have made their theory of pro 
positions from one end to the other a theory of 
judgments they considered a proposition or a 
judgment for they used the two words indiscrimi 
nately to consist in affirming or denying one idea of

another to judge was to put two ideas together or 
to bring one idea under another or to compare two 
ideas or to perceive the agreement or disagreiement 
between two ideas and the whole doctrine of propo 
sitions together with the theory of reasoning always 
necessarily founded upon the theory of propositions 
was stated as if ideas or conceptions or whatever 
other term the writer preferred as a name for mental 
representations generally constituted essentially the 
subject matter and substance of those operations 

it is of course true that in any case of judg 
ment as for instance when we judge that gold is 
yellow a process takes place in our minds of which 
some one or other of these theories is a partially 
correct account we must have the idea of gold and 
the idea of yellow and these two ideas must be 
brought together in our mind but in the first place 
it is evident that this is only a prt of what takes 
place for we may put two ideas together without any 
act of belief as when we merely imagine something 
such as a golden mountain or when we actually 
disbelieve for in order even to disbelieve that 
mahomet was an apostle of god we must put the 
idea of mahomet and that of an apostle of god 
together to determine what it is that happens 
in the case of assent or dissent besides putting two 
ideas together is one of the most intricate of meta 
physical problems but whatever the solution may 
be we may venture to assert that it can have nothing 
whatever to do with the import of propositions for 
this reason that propositions except where the mind 
itself is the subject treated of are not assertions 
respecting our ideas of things but assertions respect 
ing the things themselves in order to believe 
that gold is yellow i must indeed have the idea of

 names and propositions 

gold and the idea of yellbw and something having 
reference to those ideas must take place in my mind 
but my belief has not reference to the ideas it has 
reference to the things what i believe is a fiact 
relating to the outward thing gold and to the impres 
sion made by that outward thing upon the human 
organs not a fact relating to my conception of gold 
which would be a fact in my mental history not a 
fact of external nature it is true that in order to 
believe this fact in external nature another fact must 
take place in my mind a process must be performed 
upon my ideas but so it must in everything else that 
i do i cannot dig the ground unless i have the idea 
of the groimd and of a spade and of au the other 
things i am operating upon and unless i put those 
ideas together but it would be a very ridiculous 
description of digging the ground to say that it is 
putting one idea into another digging is an opera 
tion which is performed upon the things themselves 
although it cannot be performed unless i have in my 
mind the ideas of them and so in like manner 
believing is an act which has for its subject the facts 
themselves although a previous mental conception of 
the facts is an indispensable condition when i say 
that fire causes heat do i mean that my idea of fire 
causes my idea of heat no i mean that the 
natural phenomenon fire causes the natural pheno 
menon heat when i mean to assert anything re 
specting the ideas i give them their proper name i 
call them ideas as when i say that a childs idea 
of a battle is unlike the reality or that the ideas 
entertained of the deity have a great efiect on the 
characters of mankind 

the notion that what is of primary importance to 
the logician in a proposition is the relation between

import op propositions 

the two ide€i corresponding to the subject and predi 
cate instead of the relation between the two pheno 
mena which they respectively express seems to me 
one of the most fatal errors ever introduced into the 
philosophy of logic and the principal cause why the 
theory of the science has made such inconsiderable 
progress during the last two centuries the treatises 
on logic and on the branches of mental philosophy 
connected with logic which have been produced since 
the intrusion of this cardinal error though sometimes 
written by men of extraordinary abilities and attain 
ments almost always tacitly imply a theory that the 
investigation of truth consists in contemplating and 
handling our ideas or conceptions of things instead 
of the things themselves a process by which i will 
venture to affirm not a single truth ever was arrived 
at excepf truths of psychology a science of which 
ideas or conceptions are avowedly along with other 
mental phenomena the subjectmatter meanwhile 
inquiries into every kind of natural phenomena were 
incessantly establishing great and fruitful truths on the 
most important subjects by processes upon which these 
views of the nature of judgment and reasoning threw 
no light and in which they afforded no assistance 
whatever no wonder that those who knew by prac 
tical experience how truths are come at should deem 
a science futile which consisted chiefly of such specu 
lations what has been done for the advancement of 
logic since these doctrines came into vogue has been 
done not by professed logicians but by discoverers in 
the other sciences in whose methods of investigation 
many great principles of logic not previously thought 
of have successively come forth into light but who 
have generally committed the error of supposing that 
nothing whatever was known of the art of philoso

phizing by the old logicians because their modern inter 
preters have written to so little purpose respecting it 
we have to inquire then on the present occasion 
not into judgment but judgments not into the act 
of believing but into the thing believed what is 
the immediate object of belief in a proposition what 
is the matter of fact signied by it what is it to 
which when i assert the proposition i give my assent 
and call upon others to give theirs what is that 
which is expressed by the form of discourse called a 
proposition and the conformity of which to fact coa 
stitutes the truth of the proposition 

 one of the clearest and most consecutive 
thinkers whom this country or the world has pro 
duced i mean hobbes has given the following answer 
to this question in every proposition says he what 
is signified is the belief of the speaker that the predi 
cate is a name of the same thing of which the subject 
is a name and if it really is so the proposition is 
true thus the proposition all men are living 
beings he would say is true because living being 
is a name of everything of which man is a name all 
men are six feet high is not true because six feet high 
is not a name of everything though it is of some 
things of which man is a name 

what is stated by hobbes as the definition of a 
true proposition must be allowed to be a property 
v hich all true propositions possess the subject and 
predicate being both of them names of things if they 
were names of quite different things the one name could 
not consistently with its signification be predicated 
of the other if it be true that some men are copper 
coloured it must be true — and the proposition does 
really assert — that among the individuals denoted by

import of propositions 

the name dian there are some who are also among 
those denoted by the name coppercoloured if it be 
true that all oxen ruminate it must be true that all the 
individuals denoted by the name ox are also among 
those denoted by the name ruminating and whoever 
asserts that all oxen ruminate undoubtedly does assert 
that this relation subsists between the two names 

the assertion therefore which according to 
hobbes is the only one made in any proposition really 
is made in every proposition and his analysis has 
consequently one of the requisites for being the true 
one we may go a step farther it is the only 
analysis that is rigorously true of all propositions 
without exception what he gives as the meaning 
of propositions is part of the meaning of all propo 
sitions and the whole meaning of some this how 
ever only shows what an extremely minute fragment 
of meaning it is quite possible to include within the 
logical formula of a proposition it does not show 
that no proposition means more to warrant us in 
putting together two words with a copula between 
them it is really enough that the thing or things 
denoted by one of the names should be capable 
without violation of usage of being called by the 
other name also if then this be all the meaning 
necessarily implied in the form of discourse called a 
proposition why do i object to it as the scientific 
definition of what a proposition means because 
though the mere collocation which makes the propo 
sition a proposition conveys no more meaning than 
hobbes contends for that same collocation combined 
with other circumstances that orm combined with 
other matter does convey more and much more 

the only propositions of which hobbes principb 
is a sufficient account are that limited and unim

 names and propositions 

portant class in which both the predicate and the 
subject are proper names for as has already been 
remarked proper names have strictly no meaning 
they are mere marks for individual objects and 
when a proper name is predicated of another proper 
name all the signification conveyed is that both the 
names are marks for the same object but this is 
precisely what hobbes produces as a theory of predi 
cation in general his doctrine is a full explanation 
of such predications as these hyde was clarendon 
or tuuy is cicero it exhausts the meaning of those 
propositions but it is a sadly inadequate theory of 
any others that it should ever have been thought 
of as such can be accounted for only by the fact that 
hobbes in common with the other nominalists 
bestowed little or no attention upon the connotation of 
words and sought for their meaning exclusively in 
what they denote as if all names had been what none 
but proper names really are marks put upon indivi 
duals and as if there were no difference between a 
proper and a general name except that the first denotes 
only one individual and the last a greater number 

it has been seen however that the meaning of all 
names except proper names and that portion of the 
class of abstract names which are not connotative 
resides in the connotation when therefore we are 
analjtsing the meaning of any proposition in which 
the predicate and the subject or either of them are 
connotative names it is to the connotation of those 
terms that we must exclusively look and not to what 
they denote or in the language of hobbes language 
so far correct are names of 

in asserting that the truth of a proposition depends 
upon the conformity of import between its terms as 
for instance that the proposition socrates is wise

is a true proposition because socrates and wise are 
names applicable to or as he expresses it names 
of the same person it is very remarkable that so 
powerful a thinker should not have asked himself 
the question but how came they to be names of the 
same person surely not because such was the inten 
tion of those who invented the words when man 
kind fixed the meaning of the word wise they were 
not thinking of socrates nor when his parents gave 
him the name socrates were they thinking of wisdom 
the names happen to fit the same person because of a 
certain fact which fact was not known nor in being 
when the names were invented if we want to know 
what the fact is we shall find the due to it in the 
connotation of the names 

a bird or a stone a man or a wise man means 
simply an object having such and such attributes 
the real meaning of the word man is those attributes 
and not john peter thomas c the word mortal 
in like manner connotes a certain attribute or attri 
butes and when we say all men are mortal the 
meaning of the proposition is that all beings which 
possess the one set of attributes possess also the 
other if in our experience the attributes connoted 
by man are always accompanied by the attribute con 
noted by mortal it will follow as a consequence that 
the class man will be wholly included in the class 
mortal and that mortal will be a name of all things of 
which man is a name but why those objects are 
brought under the name by possessing the attributes 
connoted by it but their possession of the attributes 
is the real condition on which the truth of the propo 
sition depends not their being called by the name

attributes which they connote if one attribute hap

a mere consequence of the conjunction between the

circumstances of the experiments such that what was 
true of those individuals might be concluded to be

is of all substances possessing the attributes which 
the name connotes the assertion therefore when 
analysed is that wherever we find certain attributes 
there will be foimd a certain other attribute which 
is not a question of the signification of names but

perspicuously expressed may almost be said to have 
taken the rank of an established opinion the most 
generally received notion of predication decidedly is 
that it consists in referring something to a class i e 
either placing an individual under a class or placing 
one class under another class thus the proposition 
man is mortal asserts according to this view of it 
that the class man is included in the class mortal 
 plato is a philosopher asserts that the individual 
plato is one of those who compose the class philo 
sopher if the proposition is negative then instead 
of placing something in a class it is said to exclude 
something from a class thus if the following be the 
proposition the elephant is not carnivorous what is 
asserted according to this theory is that the elephant 
is excluded from the class carnivorous or is not 
numbered among the things comprising that class 
there is no real diflerence except in language between 
this theory of predication and the theory of hobbes 
for a class is absolutely nothing but an indefinite 
number of individuals denoted by a general name 
the name given to them in common is what makes 
them a class to refer anything to a class therefore 
is to look upon it as one of the things which are to 
be called by that common name to exclude it from 
a class is to say that the common name is not appli 
cable to it 

how widely these views of predication have pre 
vailed is evident from this that they are the basis of 
the celebrated dictum de omni et nullo when the 
syllogism is resolved by all who treat of it into an 
inference that what is true of a class is true of all 
things whatever that belong to the class and when 
this is laid down by almost all professed logicians as 
the ultimate principle to which all reasoning owes its

validity it is clear that in the general estimation of 
logicians the propositions of which reasonings are 
composed can be the expression of nothing but the 
process of dividing things into classes and referring 
everything to its proper class 

this theory appears to me a signal example of a 
logical error very often committed in logic that of 
virrepoy irporepovy or explaining a thing by something 
which presupposes it when i say that snow is 
white i may and ought to be thinking of snow as a 
class because i am asserting a proposition as true of 
all snow but i am certainly not thinking of white 
objects as a class i am thinking of no white object 
whatever except snow but only of that and of the 
sensation of white which it gives me when indeed 
i have judged or assented to the propositions that 
snow is white and that several other things also are 
white i gradually begin to think of white objects as a 
class including snow and those other things but 
this is a conception which followed not preceded 
those judgments and therefore cannot be given as an 
explanation of them instead of explaining the effect 
by the cause this doctrine explains the cause by the 
effect and is i conceive founded upon a latent 
misconception of the nature of classification 

there is a sort of language very generally pre 
valent in these discussions which seems to suppose 
that classification is an arrangement and grouping 
of definite and known individuals that when names 
were imposed mankind took into consideration all 
the individual objects in the universe made them up 
into parcels or lists and gave to the objects of each 
list a common name repeating this operation toties 
quoties until they had invented all the general names 
of which language consists which having been once

done if a question subsequently arises whether a 
certain general name can be truly predicated of a 
certain particular object we have only as it were to 
read the roll of the objects upon which that name 
was conferred and see whether the object about which 
the question arises is to be found among them the 
iramers of language it would seem to be supposed 
have predetermined all the objects that are to compose 
each class and we have only to refer to the record of 
an antecedent decision 

so absurd a doctrine will be owned by nobody 
when thus nakedly stated but if the commonly 
received explanations of classification and naming do 
not imply this theory it requires to be shown how 
they admit of being reconciled with any other 

general names are not marks put upon definite 
objects classes are not made by drawing a line roimd 
a given number of assignable individuals the objects 
which compose any given class are perpetually fluc 
tuating we may frame a class without knowing the 
individuals or even any of the individuals of which it 
will be composed we may do so while believing that 
no such individuals exist if by the meaning of a 
general name are to be understood the things which it 
is the name of no general name except by accident 
has a fixed meaning at all or ever long retains the 
same meaning the only mode in which any general 
name has a definite meaning is by being a name of an 
indefinite variety of things namely of all things 
known or unknown past present or future which 
possess certain definite attributes when by studying 
not the meaning of words but the phenomena of 
nature we discover that these attributes are possessed 
by some object not previously known to possess them

it did not already belong to the class we place the 
individual in the class because the proposition is true 
the proposition is not true because the object is placed 
in the class 

it will appear hereafter in treating of reasoning 
how much the theory of that intellectual process has 
been vitiated by the influence of these erroneous 
views and by the habit which they exemplify of 
assimilating all the operations of the human imder 
standing which have truth for their object to 
processes of mere classification and naming un 
fortunately the minds which have been entangled in 
this net are precisely those which have escaped the 
other cardinal error commented upon in the beginning 
of the present chapter since the revolution which 
dislodged aristotle from the schools logicians may 
almost be divided into those who have looked upon 
reasoning as essentially an affair of ideas and those 
who have looked upon it as essentially an affair of 
names 

one thing it is but just to remark although 
hobbes theory of predication according to the well 
known remark of leibnitz and the avowal of hobbes 
himself renders truth and falsity completely arbi 
trary with no standard but the will of men it must 
not be concluded that either hobbes or any of the 
other philosophers who have in the main agreed with

were arbitrarily made by those that first of all imposed names upon

general names are given to things on account of their

exciting in human beinga the sensation which we call 
a sensation of white it will be admitted that by 
asserting the proposition we wish to communicate 
information of that physical fact and are not thinking 
of the names exct as the necessary means of 
making that communication the meaning of the 
proposition therefore is that the individual thing 
denoted by the subject has the attributes connoted 
by the predicate 

if we now suppose the subject also to be a con 
notative name the meaning expressed by the propo 
sition has advanced a step farther in complication 
let us first suppose the proposition to be universal 
as well as affirmative a men are mortal in 
this case as in the last what the proposition asserts 
or expresses a belief in is of course that the objects 
denoted by the subject man possess the attributes 
connoted by the predicate mortal but the charac 
teristic of this case is that the objects are no longer 
individually designated they are pointed out only 
by some of their attributes they are the objects called 
men that is the beings possessing the attributes con 
noted by the name man and the only thing known 
of them may be those attributes indeed as the 
proposition is general and the objects denoted by the 
subject are therefore indefinite in number most of 
them are not known individually at all the asser 
tion therefore is not as before that the attributes 
which the predicate connotes are possessed by any 
given individual or by any number of individuals 
previously known as john thomas richard c but 
that those attributes are possessed by each and every 
individual possessing certain other attributes that 
whatever has the attributes connoted by the subject 
has also those connoted by the predicate that the

latter set of attributes constantly accompany the former 
set whatever has the attributes of man has the 
attribute of mortality mortality constantly accom 
panies the attributes of man 

if it be remembered that every attribute is grounded 
upon some fact or phenomenon either of outward 
sense or of inward consciousness and that to possess 
an attribute is another phrase for being the cause of 
or forming part of the fact or phenomenon upon 
which the attribute is grounded we may add one 
more step to complete the analysis the proposition 
which asserts that one attribute always accompanies 
another attribute does really assert thereby no other 
thing than this that one phenomenon always accom 
panies another phenomenon insomuch that where we 
find the one we have assurance of the existence of the 
other thus in the proposition all men are mortal 
the word man connotes the attributes which we 
ascribe to a certain kind of living creatures on the 
ground of certain phenomena which they exhibit and 
which are partly physical phenomena namely the 
impressions made on our senses by their bodily form 
and structure and partly mental phenomena namely 
the sentient and intellectual life which they have of 
their own all this is understood when we utter the 
word man by any one to whom the meaning of the 
word is known now when we say man is mortal 
we mean that wherever these various physical and men 
tal phenomena are all found there we have assurance 
that the other physical and mental phenomenon called 
death will not fail to take place the proposition 
does not affirm when for the connotation of the word 
mortal goes no farther than to the occurrence of the 
phenomenon at some time or other leaving the pre

import of propositions 

§ we have already proceeded far enough not 
only to demonstrate the error of hobbes but to 
ascertain the real import of by far the most numerous 
class of propositions the object of belief in a propo 
sition when it asserts anything more than the meaning 
of words is generally as in the cases which we have 
examined either the coexistence or the sequence of 
two phenomena at the very commencement of our 
inquiry we found that every act of beuef impued two 
things we have now ascertained what in the most 
frequent case these two things are namely two 
phenomena in other words two states of conscious 
ness and what it is which the proposition affirms or 
denies to subsist between them namely either suc 
cession or coexistence and this case includes innu 
merable instances which no one previous to reflec 
tion would think of referring to it take the following 
example a generous person is worthy of honour 
who would expect to recognize here a case of coex 
istence between phenomena but so it is the 
attribute which causes a person to be termed generous 
is ascribed to him on the ground of states of his mind 
and particulars of his conduct both are phenomena 
the former are facts of internal consciousness the 
latter so far as distinct from the former are physical 
facts or perceptions of the senses worthy of honour 
admits of a similar analysis honour as here used 
means a state of approving and admiring emotion 
followed upon occasion by corresponding outward 
acts worthy of honour connotes all this together 
with our approval of the act of showing honour all 
these are phenomena states of internal consciousness 
accompanied or followed by physical facts when 
we say a generous person is worthy of honour we 
affirm coexistence between the two complicated phe

nomeda connoted by the two terms respectively we 
affirm that wherever and whenever the inward feelings 
and outward facts implied in the word generosity have 
place then and there the existence and manifestation 
of an inward feeling honour would be followed in our 
minds by another inward feeling approval 

after the analysis in a former chapter of the import 
of names many examples are not needed to illustrate 
the import of propositions when there is any obscu 
rity or difficulty it does not lie in the meaning of the 
proposition but in the meaning of the names which 
compose it in the complicated nature of the conno 
tation of many words the immense multitude and 
prolonged series of facts which often constitute the 
phenomenon connoted by a name but where it is 
seen what the phenomenon is there is seldom any 
difficulty in seeing that the assertion conveyed by the 
proposition is the coexistence of one such phenomenon 
with another or the succession of one such pheno 
menon to another their conjunction in short so that 
where the one is found we may calculate on finding 
both 

this however though the most common is not 
the only meaning which propositions are ever intended 
to convey in the first place sequences and coex 
istences are not only asserted respecting phenomena 
we make propositions also respecting those hidden 
causes of phenomena which are named substances 
and attributes a substance however being to us 
nothing but either that which causes or that which 
is conscious of phenomena and the same being true 
mutatis mutandisy of attributes no assertion can be 
made at least with a meaning concerning these un 
known and unknowable entities beyond their mere 
existence except in virtue of the phenomena by

which alone they manifest themselves to our faculties 
when we say socrates was contemporary with the 
peloponnesian war the foundation of this assertion 
as of all assertions concerning substances is an 
assertion concerning the phenomena which they 
exhibit— namely that the series of facts by which 
socrates manifested himself to mankind and the 
series of mental states which constituted his earthly 
existence went on simultaneously with the series of 
facts known by the name of the peloponnesian war 
still the proposition does not assert that alone it 
asserts that the thing in itself the noumenon socrates 
was existing and doing or experiencing those various 
facts during the same time coexistence and se 
quence therefore may be affirmed or denied not only 
between phenomena but between noumena or between 
a noumenon and phenomena and there is one kind of 
assertion which maybe made respecting noumena inde 
pendently of the phenomena which are their sensible 
manifestation the assertion of their simple existence 
but what is a noumenon an unknown cause in 
affirming therefore the existence of a noumenon we 
affirm causation here therefore are two additional 
kinds of fact capable of being asserted in a proposi 
tion besides the propositions which assert sequence 
or coexistence there are some which assert simple 
existence and others assert causation which subject 
to the explanations which will follow in the third 
book must be considered provisionally as a distinct 
and pecutiar kind of assertion 

 to these four kinds of matteroffact or 
assertion must be added a fifth resemblance this 
was a species of attribute which we found it iimossible 
to analyze for which no fundamentum distinct from

the objects themselves could be assigned in addi 
tion to propositions which assert a sequence or coex 
istence between two phenomena there are therefore 
also propositions which assert resemblance between 
them as this colour is like that colour — the heat 
of today is equal to the heat of yesterday it is true 
that such an assertion might with some plausibility be 
brought within the description of an affirmation of 
sequence by considering it as an assertion that the 
simultaneous contemplation of the two colours is 
followed by a specific feeling termed the feeling of 
resemblance but there would be nothing gained by 
encumbering ourselves especially in this place with 
a generalization which may be looked upon as strained 
logic does not undertake to analyze things into their 
ultimate elements resemblance between two pheno 
mena is more intelligible in itself than any explanation 
could make it and under any classification must 
remain specifically distinct from the ordinary cases of 
sequence and coexistence 

it is sometimes said that all propositions what 
ever of which the predicate is a general name do in 
point of fact affirm or deny resemblance all such 
propositions affirm that a thing belongs to a class 
but things being classed together according to their 
resemblance everything is of course classed with the 
things which it resembles most and thence it may 
be said when we affirm that gold is a metal or that 
socrates is a man the affirmation intended is that 
gold resembles other metals and socrates other men 
more nearly than they resemble the objects contained 
in any other of the classes coordinate with these 

there is some slight degree of foundation for 
this repark but no more than a slight degree the 
arrangement of things into classes such as the class

metaly or the class man is grounded indeed upon a 
resemblance among the things which are placed in 
the same class but not upon a mere general resem 
blance the resemblance it is grounded upon consists 
in the possession by all those things of certain common 
peculiarities and those peculiarities it is which the 
terms connote and which the propositions conse 
quently assert not the resemblance for though 
when i say gold is a metal i say by implication 
that if there be any other metals it must resemble 
them yet if there were no other metals i might still 
assert the proposition with the same meaning as at pre 
sent namely that gold has the various properties im 
plied in the word metal just as it might be said chris 
tians are men even if there were no men who were 
not christians or as the expression jehovah is god 
might be used by the firmest believer in the unity of 
the godhead propositions therefore in which ob 
jects are referred to a class because they possess the 
attributes constituting the class are so far from 
asserting nothing but resemblance that they do not 
properly speaking assert resemblance at all 

but we remarked some time ago and the reasons 
of the remark will be more fully entered into in a 
subsequent book that there is sometimes a conve 
nience in extending the boundaries of a class so as to 
include things which possess in a very inferior degree 
if in any the characteristic properties of the class — 
provided they resemble that class more than any 
other insomuch that the general propositions which 
are true of the class will be nearer to being true of 
those things than any other equally general proposi 
tions as for instance there are substances called 
metals which have very few of the properties by which 
metals are commonly recognised and almost every

properly belonged now when the classname is pre 
dicated of any object of this description we do by so 
predicating it affirm resemblance and nothing more 
and in order to be scrupulously correct it ought to 
be said that in every case in which we predicate a

possesses the properties designated by the name but 
that it either possesses those properties or if it does 
not at any rate resembles the things which do so 
more than it resembles any other things in most

§ in the foregoing inquiry into the import of 
propositions we have thought it necessary to ana 
lyze directly those alone in which the terms of the 
proposition or the predicate at least are concrete 
terms but in doing so we have indirectly analyzed 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

those in which the terms are abstract the distinc 
tion between an abstract term and its corresponding 
concrete is no difference in what they are appointed 
to signify for the real signification of a concrete 
general name is as we have so often said its con 
notation and what the concrete term connotes forms 
the entire meaning of the abstract name since there 
is nothing in the import of an abstract name which 
is not in the import of the corresponding concrete it 
is natural to suppose that neither can tiiere be any 
thing in the import of a proposition of which the 
terms are abstract but what there is in some proposi 
tion which can be framed of concrete terms 

and this presumption a closer examination will 
confirm an abstract name is the name of an attri 
bute or combination of attributes the correspond 
ing concrete is a name given to things because of 
and in order to express their possessing that attribute 
or that combination of attributes when therefore 
we predicate of anything a concrete name the attribute 
is what we in reality predicate of it but it has now 
been shown that in all propositions of which the pre 
dicate is a concrete name what is really predicated is 
oneof five things existence coexistence causation 
sequence or resemblance an attribute therefore 
is necessarily either an existence a coexistence a 
causation a sequence or a resemblance when a 
proposition consists of a subject and predicate which 
are abstract terms it consists of terms which must 
necessarily signify one or other of these things when 
we predicate of any thing an abstract name we affirm 
of the thing that it is one or other of these five things 
that it is a case of existence or of coexistence or of 
causation or of sequence or of resemblance

of which only the subject is an abstract name — 
 thoughtlessness is dangerous thoughtlessness 
is an attribute groimded on the facts which we call 
thoughtless actions and the proposition is equivalent 
to this thoughtless actions are dangerous in the 
next example the predicate as well as the subject are 
abstract names whiteness is a colour or the 
colour of snow is a whiteness these attributes 
being grounded upon sensations the equivalent pro 
positions in the concrete would be the sensation of 
white is one of the sensations called those of colour — 
the sensation of sight caused by looking at snow is 
one of the sensations caued sensations of white in 
these propositions as we have before seen the matter 
offact asserted is a resemblance in the following 
examples the concrete terms are those which directly 
correspond to the abstract names connoting the at 
tribute which these denote prudence is a virtue 
this may be rendered all prudent persons in so 
far as prudent are virtuous courage is deserving 
of honour thus all courageous persons are de 
serving of honour so far forth as they are courageous 
which is equivalent to this — a courageous persons 
deserve an addition to the honour or a diminution 
of the disgrace which would attach to them on other 
grounds 

in order to throw still further ught upon the 
import of propositions of which the terms are abstract

we will subject one of the examples given above to a 
minuter analysis tlie proposition we shall select is 
the following — prudence is a virtue let us sub 
stitute for the word virtue an equivalent but more defi 
nite expression such as a mental quality beneficial to 
society or a mental quality pleasing to god or 
whichever other of the definitions of virtue we prefer 
what the proposition asserts is a sequence accompa 
nied with causation namely that benefit to society 
or that the approval of god is consequent upon 
and caused by prudence here is a sequence but 
between what we understand the consequent of 
the sequence but we have yet to analyze the ante 
cedent prudence is an attribute and in connexion 
with it two things besides itself are to be considered 
prudent persons who are the subjects of the attribute 
and prudential conduct which may be called the foun 
dation of it now is either of these the antecedent 
and first is it meant that the approval of god or 
benefit to society is attendant upon all prudent persons 
no except in so far forth as they are prudent for 
prudent persons who are scoundrels can seldom on the 
whole be beneficial to society nor acceptable to even 
finite wisdom is it upon prudential conduct y then 
that divine approbation and benefit to mankind are 
invariably consequent neither is this the assertion 
meant when it is said that prudence is a virtue 
except with the same reservation as before and for 
the same reason namely that prudential conduct 
although in so far as it is prudential it is beneficial 
to society may yet by reason of some other of its 
qualities be productive of an injury outweighing the 
benefit and of a divine displeasure exceeding the 
approbation which would be due to the prudence

nor the phenomenon the cxnduct is an antece

causes them to be called prudent and which is equally 
in them when the action though prudent is wicked 
namely a correct foresight of consequences a just esti

repression of any unreflecting impulse at variance with 
the deliberate purpose these which are states of the 
persons mind are the real antecedent in the sequence 
the real cause in the causation which are asserted by 
the proposition but these are also the real ground 
or foundation of the attribute prudence since where 
ever these states of mind exist we may predicate 
prudence even before we know whether any conduct 
has followed and in this manner every assertion re 
specting an attribute may be transformed into an 
assertion exactly equivalent respecting the fact or 
phenomenon which is the ground of the attribute 
and no case can be assigned where that which is 
predicated of the fact or phenomenon does not belong 
to one or other of the five species formerly enume

sequence coexistence causation or resemblance 

and as these five are the only things which can 
be affirmed so are they the only things which can be

chapter vi 

of propositions merely verbal 

§ as a preparation for the inquiry which is 
the proper object of logic namely in what manner 
propositions are to be proved we have found it neces 
sary to inquire what they contain which requires or is 
susceptible of proof or which is the same thing 
what they assert in the course of this preliminary 
investigation into the import of propositions we 
examined the opinion of the conceptualists that a 
proposition is the expression of a relation between 
two ideas and the doctrine of the nominalists that it 
is the expression of an agreement or disagreement 
between the meanings of two names we decided 
that as general theories both of these are erroneous 
and that although propositions may be made both 
respecting names and respecting ideas neither the 
one nor the other are the subjectmatter of proposi 
tions considered generally we then examined the 
different kinds of propositions and we found that 
with the exception of those which are merely verbal 
they assert five different kinds of matters of fact 
namely existence order in place order in time 
causation and resemblance that in every propo 
sition one of these five is either aflsrmed or denied of 
some fact or phenomenon or of some object the 
unknown source of a fact or phenomenon 

in distinguishing however the different kinds of 
matters of fact asserted in propositions we reserved 
one class of propositions which do not relate to any

 names and propositions 

matter of fact in the proper sense of the term at all 
but to the meaning of names since names and their 
signification are entirely arbitrary such propositions 
are not strictly speaking susceptible of truth or 
ialsity but only of conformity or disconformity to 
usage or convention and all the proof they are 
capable of is proof of usage proof that the words 
have been employed by others in the acceptation in 
which the speaker or writer desires to use them 
these propositions occupy however a conspicuous 
place in philosophy and their nature and charac 
teristics are of as much importance in logic as those 
of any of the other classes of propositions previously 
adverted to 

if all propositions respecting the signification of 
words were as simple and imimportant as those which 
served us for examples when examining hobbes 
theory of predication viz those of which the subject 
and predicate are proper names and which assert only 
that those names have or that they have not been 
conventionally assigned to the same individual there 
would be little to attract to such propositions the atten 
tion of philosophers but the class of merely verbal 
propositions embraces not only much more than these 
but much more than any propositions which at first 
sight present themselves as verbal comprehending 
a kind of assertions which have been regarded not 
only as relating to things but as having actually a 
more intimate relation with them than any other pro 
positions whatever the student in philosophy will 
perceive that i allude to the distinction on which so 
much stress was laid by the schoolmen and which has 
been retained either under the same or under other 
names by most metaphysicians to the present day 
viz between what were called essential and what

were called accidental y propositions and between 
essential and accidental properties or attributes 

 almost all metaphysicians prior to locke 
as well as many since his time have made a great 
mystery of essential predication and of predicates 
which were said to be of the essence of the subject 
the essence of a thing they said was that without 
which the thing could neither be nor be conceived to 
be thus rationauty was of the essence of man 
because without rationality man could not be con 
ceived to exist the diflferent attributes which made 
up the essence of the thing were called its essential 
properties and a proposition in which any of these 
were predicated of it was called an essential propo 
sition and was considered to go deeper into the 
nature of the thing and to convey more important 
information respecting it than any other proposition 
could do all properties not of the essence of the 
thing were called its accidents were supposed to 
have nothing at all or nothing comparatively to do 
with its inmost nature and the propositions in which 
any of these were predicated of it were called acci 
dental propositions a connexion may be traced 
between this distinction which originated with the 
schoolmen and the well known dogmas of substantus 
secunddsy or general substances and substantial forms 
doctrines which under varieties of language pervaded 
alike the aristotelian and the platonic schools and of 
which more of the spirit has come down to modern 
times than might be conjectured from the disuse of 
the phraseology the false views of the nature of 
classification and generalization which prevailed 
among the schoolmen and of which these dogmas 
were the technical expression afford the only expla

nation which can be given of their having misunder 
stood the real nature of those essences which held so 
conspicuous a place in their philosophy they said 
truly that man cannot be conceived without rationauty 
but though man cannot a being may be conceived 
exactly like a man in all points except that one 
quality and those others which are the conditions or 
consequences of it all therefore which is really true 
in the assertion that man cannot be conceived with 
out rationality is only that if he had not rationality 
he would not be reputed a man there is no impos 
sibility in conceiving the thing nor for aught we 
know in its existing the impossibiuty is in the con 
ventions of language which will not allow the thing 
even if it exist to be called by the name which is 
reserved for rational beings rationality in short is 
involved in the meaning of the word man it is one 
of the attributes connoted by the name the essence 
of man simply means the whole of the attributes 
connoted by the word and any one of those attributes 
taken singly is an essential property of man 

the doctrines which prevented the real meaning 
of essences from being understood not having 
assumed so settled a shape in the time of aristotle 
and his immediate followers as was afterwards given 
to them by the realists of the middle ages we find a 
nearer approach to true views of the subject in the 
writings of the ancient aristotelians than in their 
more modem followers porphyry in his hagoge 
approached so near to the true conception of essence 
that only one step remained to be taken but this 
step so easy in appearance was reserved for the 
nominalists of modern times by altering any pro

was of its essence you made it another things axko 
to a modem it is obvious that between the change 
which only makes a thing different and the change 
which makes it another thing the only distinction is 
that in the one case though changed it is still called 
by the same name thus pound ice in a mortar 
and being still called ice it is only made axxolov 
melt it and it becomes sxxo another thing namely 
water now it is really the same thing i e the same 
particles of matter in both cases and you cannot so 
change anything that it shall cease to be the same 
thing in this sense the identity which it can be 
deprived of is merely that of the name when the 
thing ceases to be called ice it becomes another thing 
its essence what constitutes it ice is gone while so 
long as it continues to be so called nothing is gone 
except some of its accidents but these reflections 
so easy to us would have been difficult to persons 
who thought as most of the aristotelians did that 
objects were made what they were called that ice for 
instance was made ice not by the possession of 
certain properties to which mankind have chosen to 
attach that name but by participation in the nature 
of a certain general substance called ice in general 
which substance together with all the properties that 
belonged to it inhered in every individual piece of ice 
as they did not consider these universal substances to 
be attached to all general names but only to some 
they thought that an object borrowed only a part of

its properties from an universal substance and that 
the rest belonged to it individually the former they 
called its essence and the latter its accidents the 
scholastic doctrine of essences long survived the 
theory on which it rested that of the existence of real 
entities corresponding to general terms and it was 
reserved for locke at the end of the seventeenth 
century to convince philosophers that the supposed 
essences of classes were merely the signification of 
their names nor among the signal services which that 
great man rendered to philosophy was there one more 
needful or more valuable 

now as the most familiar of the general names 
predicable of an object usually connotes not one only 



 few among the great names in philosophy have met with a 
harder measure of justice from the present generation than locke 
the unquestioned founder of the analytic philosophy of mind but 
whose doctrines were first caricatured then when the reaction 
arrived oast o£r by the prevailing school even with contumely and 
who is now regarded by one of the conflicting parties in philosophy 
as an apostle of heresy and sophistry while among those who still 
adhere to the standard which he raised there has been a disposition 
in later times to sacrifice his reputation in favour of hobbes a 
great writer and a great thinker for his time but inferior to locke 
not only in sober judgment but even in profundity and original 
genius locke the most candid of philosophers and one whose 
speculations bear on every subject the strongest marks of having 
been wrought out from the materials of his own mind has been 
mistaken for an unworthy plagiarist while hobbes has been extolled 
as having anticipated many of his leading doctrines he did anti 
cipate many of them and the present is an instance in what manner 
it was generally done they both rejected the scholastic doctrine 
of essences but locke understood and explained what these sup 
posed essences really were hobbes instead of explaining the dis 
tinction between essential and accidental properties and between 
essential and accidental propositions jumped over it and gave a 
definition which suits at most only essential propositions and 
scarcely those as the definition of proposition in general

but several attributes of the object each of which 
attributes separately forms also the bond of union 
of some class and the meaning of some general 
name we may predicate of a name which connotes a 
variety of attributes another name which connotes 
only one of these attributes or some smaller number 
of them than all in such cases the universal 
affirmative proposition will be true since whatever 
possesses the whole of any set of attributes must 
possess any part of that same set a proposition of 
this sort however conveys no information to any one 
who previously understood the whole meaning of the 
terms the propositions every man is a corporeal 
being every man is a living creature every man is 
rational convey no knowledge to any one who was 
already aware of the entire meaning of the word mariy 
for the meaning of the word includes all this and 
that every man has the attributes connoted by all these 
predicates is already asserted when he is called a 
man now of this nature are all the propositions 
which have been called essential they are in fact 
identical propositions 

it is true that a proposition which predicates any 
attribute even though it be one implied in the name 
is in most cases understood to involve a tacit assertion 
that there eonsts a thing corresponding to the name 
and possessing the attributes connoted by it and this 
implied assertion may convey information even to 
those who understood the meaning of the name but 
all information of this sort conveyed by all the 
essential propositions of which man can be made the 
subject is included in the assertion men exist and 
this assumption of real existence is after all only the 
result of an imperfection of language it arises from 
the ambiguity of the copula which in addition to

 names and propositions 

its proper office of a mark to show that an assertion is 
made is also as we have formerly remarked a con 
crete word connoting existence the actual existence 
of the subject of the proposition is therefore only 
apparently not really implied in the predication if 
an essential one we may say a ghost is a disembodied 
spirit without believing in ghosts but an acci 
dental or nonessential affirmation does imply the 
real existence of the subject because in the case of a 
nonexistent subject there is nothing for the propo 
sition to assert such a proposition as the ghost of 
a murdered person haunts the couch of the murderer 
can only have a meaning if understood as implying 
a belief in ghosts for since the signification of the 
word ghost implies nothing of the kind the speaker 
either means nothing or means to assert a thing 
which he wishes to be believed really to have taken 
place 

it will be hereafter seen that when any important 
consequences seem to follow as in mathematics from 
an essential proposition or in other words from a 
proposition involved in the meaning of a name what 
they really flow from is the tacit assumption of the 
real existence of the object so named apart from 
this assumption of real existence the class of propo 
sitions in which the predicate is of the essence of the 
subject that is in which the predicate connotes the 
whole or part of what the subject connotes but 
nothing besides answer no purpose but that of 
unfolding the whole or some part of the meaning of 
the name to those who did not previously know it 
accordingly the most useful and in strictness the 
only useful kind of essential propositions are defi 
nitions which to be complete should unfold the

defined that is when it is a connotalive word the 
whole of what it connotes in defining a name how 
ever it is not usual to specify its entire connotation 
but so much only as is suflscient to mark out the 
objects usually denoted by it from all other known 
objects and sometimes a merely accidental property 
not involved in the meaning of the name answers 
this purpose equally well the various kinds of defi 
nition which these distinctions give rise to and the 
piuposes to which they are respectively subservient 
will be minutely considered in the proper place 

§ according to the above view of essential pro 
positions no proposition can be reckoned such which 
relates to an individual by name that is in which the 
subject is a proper name individuals have no es 
sences when the schoolmen talked of the essence 
of an individual they did not mean the properties im 
plied in its name for the names of individuals imply 
no properties they regarded as of the essence of an 
individual whatever was of the essence of the species 
in which they were accustomed to place that indivi 
dual i ef of the class to which it was most familiarly 
referred and to which therefore they conceived that 
it by nature belonged thus because the propo 
sition man is a rational being was an essential pro 
position they aflsrmed the same thing of the propo 
sition julius csesar is a rational being this fol 
lowed very naturally if genera and species were to be 
considered as entities distinct from but inhering in 
the individuals composing them if man was a sub 
stance inhering in each individual man the essence of 
man whatever that might mean was naturally sup 
posed to accompany it to inhere in john thompson 
and form the common essence of thompson and julius

cesar it might then be fairly said that rationality 
being of the essence of man was of the essence also 
of thompson but if man altogether be only the 
individual men and a name bestowed upon them in 
consequence of certain common properties what 
becomes of john thompsons essence 

a fundamental error is seldom expelled from phi 
losophy by a single victory it retreats slowly 
defends every inch of groimd and often retains a 
footing in some remote fastness after it has been 
driven from the open country the essences of indi 
viduals were an unmeaning figment arising from a 
misapprehension of the essences of classes yet even 
locke when he extirpated the parent error could not 
shake himself free from that which was its fruit he 
distinguished two sorts of essences real and nominal 
his nominal essences were the essences of classes 
explained nearly as we have now explained them 
nor is anything wanting to render the third book of 
lockes essay a nearly perfect treatise on the con 
notation of names except to free its language from 
the assumption of what are called abstract ideas 
which unfortunately is involved in the phraseology 
although not necessarily connected with the thoughts 
contained in that immortal third book but 



 the always acute and often profound author of an outline of 
sematolgy mr b h smart justly says locke will be much 
more intelligible if in the majority of places wo substitute the 
knowledge of for what he calls the idea of p among the 
many criticitms upon lockes use of the word idea this is the only 
one which as it appears to me precisely hits the mark and i quote 
it for the additional reason that it precisely expresses the point of 
diflference respecting the import of propositions between my view 
and what i have called the conceptualist view of them where a 
conccptualist says that a name or a proposition expresses our idea of 
a thing i should generally say instead of our idea our knowledge 
or belief concerning the thing itself googlc

besides nominal essences he admitted real essences 
or essences of individual objects which he supposed to 
be the causes of the sensible properties of those 
objects we know not said he what these are 
and this acknowledgment rendered the fiction com 
paratively innocuous but if we did we could from 
them alone demonstrate the sensible properties of 
the object as the properties of the triangle are demon 
strated from the definition of the triangle i shall 
have occasion to revert to this theory in treating of 
demonstration and of the conditions under which one 
property of a thing admits of being demonstrated from 
another property it is enough here to remark that 
according to this definition the real essence of an 
object has in the progress of physics come to be 
conceived as nearly equivalent in the case of bodies 
to their corpuscular structure what it is now sup 
posed to mean in the case of any other entities i 
would not take upon myself to define 

§ an essential proposition then is one which 
is purely verbal which asserts of a thing under a 
particular name only what is asserted of it in the 
fact of calling it by that name and which therefore 
either gives no information or gives it respecting the 
name not the thing nonessential or accidental 
propositions on the contrary may be called real pro 
positions in opposition to verbal they predicate of 
a thing some fact not involved in the signification of 
the name by which the proposition speaks of it some 
attribute not connoted by that name such are all 
propositions concerning things individually designated 
and all general or particular propositions in which the

in my knowledge of the meaning of the words nor 
even of the existence of things answering to the signi 
fication of those words it is this class of propositions 
only whicli are in themselves instructive or from 
which any instructive propositions can be inferred 

nothing has probably contributed more to the 
opinion so commonly prevalent of the futility of the 
school logic than the circumstance that almost all 
the examples used in the common school books to 
illustrate the doctrines of predication and of the syllo 
gism consist of essential propositions they were 
usually taken either from the branches or from the 
main trunk of the predicamental tree which included 
nothing but what was of the essence of the species 
omne corpus est substantia omne animal est corpus 
omnis homo est corpus omnis homo est animal omnis 
homo est rationalis and so forth it is far from won 
derful that the syllogistic art should have been thought 
to be of no use in assisting correct reasoning when 
almost the only propositions which in the hands of 
its professed teachers it was employed to prove were 
such as every one assented to without proof the 
moment he comprehended the meaning of the words 
and stood exactly on a level in point of evidence 
with the premisses from which they were drawn i 
have therefore throughout this work studiously 
avoided the employment of essential propositions as 
examples except where the nature of the principle to

verbal and real propositions 

§ with respect to propositions which do con 
vey information which assert something of a thing 
imder a name that does not already presuppose what 
is about to be asserted there are two diflferent aspects 
in which these or rather such of them as are general 
propositions may be considered we may either look 
at them as portions of speculative truth or as memo 
randa for practical use according as we consider 
propositions in one or the other of these ughts their 
import may be conveniently expressed in one or in 
the other of two formulas 

according to the formula which we have hitherto 
employed and which is best adapted to express the 
import of the proposition as a portion of our theo 
retical knowledge all men are mortal means that 
the attributes of man are always accompanied by the 
attribute mortality no men are gods means that the 
attributes of man are never accompanied by the attri 
butes or at least never by all the attributes of a god 
but when the proposition is considered as a memo 
randum for practical use we shall find a different 
mode of expressing the same meaning better adapted 
to indicate the oflscc which the proposition performs 
the practical use of a proposition is to apprise or 
remind us what we have to expect in any individual 
case which comes within the assertion contained in 
the proposition in relerence to this purpose the 
proposition all men are mortal means that the attri 
butes of man are evidence of are a mark of mortality 
an indication by which the presence of that attribute 
is made manifest no men are gods means that the 
attributes of man are a mark or evidence that some or 
all of the attributes of a god are not there that where 
the former are we need not expect to find the latter 

these two forms of expression are at bottom equi

 names and propositions 

valent but the one points the attention more directly 
to what a proposition means the latter to the manner 
in which it is to be used 

now it is to be observed that reasoning the subject 
to which we are next to proceed is a process into 
which propositions enter not as ultimate results but 
as means to the establishment of other propositions 
we may expect therefore that the mode of exhibiting 
the import of a general propositition which shows it 
in its application to practical use will best express 
the function which propositions perform in reasoning 
and accordingly in the theory of reasoning the mode 
of viewing the subject which considers a proposition 
as asserting that one fact or phenomenon is a mark or 
evidence of another fact or phenomenon will be found 
almost indispensable for the purposes of that theory 
the best mode of defining the import of a proposition 
is not the mode which shows the most clearly what it 
is in itself but that which most distinctly suggests 
the manner in which it may be made available for 
advancing from it to other propositions

chapter vii 

of the nature of classification and the 
five predicables 

§ in examining into the nature of general pro 
positions we have adverted much less than is usual 
with logicians to the ideas of a class and classi 
fication ideas which since the realist doctrine of 
greneral substances went out of vogue have formed 
the basis of almost every attempt at a philosophical 
theory of general terms and general propositions 
we have considered general names as having a mean 
ing quite independently of their being the names of 
classes that circumstance is in truth accidental it 
being wholly inmxaterial to the signification of the 
name whether there are many objects or only one to 
which it happens to be applicable or whether there 
be any at all grod is as much a general term to 
the christian or the jew as to the poljrtheist and 
dragon hippogriff chimera mermaid ghost are 
as much so as if real objects existed corresponding 
to those names every name the signification of 
which is constituted by attributes is potentially a 
name of an indefinite number of objects but it needs 
not be actually the name of any and if of any it 
may be the name of only one as soon as we employ 
a name to connote attributes the things be they more 
or fewer which happen to possess those attributes 
are constituted ipso facto a class but in predicating 
the name we predicate only the attributes and the 
fact of belonging to a class does not in ordinary cases 
come into view at all 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

although however predication does not pre 
suppose classification and although the theory of 
names and of propositions is not cleared up but only 
encumbered by intruding the idea of classification into 
it there is nevertheless a close connexion between 
classification and the employment of general names 
by every general name which we introduce we create 
a class if there be any existing things to compose it 
that is any things corresponding to the signification 
of the name classes therefore mostly owe their 
existence to general language but general language 
also though that is not the most common case some 
times owes its existence to classes a general which 
is as much as to say a significant name is indeed 
mostly mtroduced because we have a signification to 
express by it because we need a word by means of 
which to predicate the attributes which it connotes 
but it is also true that a name is sometimes introduced 
because we have found it convenient to create a class 
because we have thought it useful for the regulation 
of our mental operations that a certain group of 
objects should be thought of together a naturalist 
for purposes connected with his particular science 
sees reason to distribute the animal or vegetable crea 
tion into certain groups rather than into any others 
and he requires a name to bind as it were each of 
his groups together it must not however be sup 
posed that such names when introduced diflfer in any 
respect as to their mode of signification from other 
connotative names the classes which they denote 
are as much as any other classes constituted by 
certain common attributes and their names are signi 
ficant of those attributes and of nothing else the 
names of cuviers classes and orders plantigrades 
digitigradest c are as much the expression of attri

classification and the predicables 

butes as if those names had preceded instead of 
growing out of his classification of animals the 
only peculiarity of the case is that the convenience of 
classification was here the primary motive for intro 
ducing the names while in other cases the name is 
introduced as a means of predication and the forma 
tion of a class denoted by it is only an indirect con 
sequence 

the principles which ought to regulate classifica 
tion as a logical process subservient to the investi 
gation of truth cannot be discussed to any purpose 
until a much later stage of our inquiry but of 
classification as resulting from and implied in the 
fact of employing general language we cannot forbear 
to treat here without leaving the theory of general 
names and of their employment in predication 
mutilated and formless 

§ thi portion of the theory of general language 
is the subject of what is termed the doctrine of the 
predicables — a set of distiilctions handed down from 
aristotle and his follower porphyry many of which 
have taken a firm root in scientific and some of them 
even in popular phraseology the predicables are 
a fivefold division of general names not grounded 
as usual upon a difference in their meaning that is 
in the attribute which they connote but upon a 
difference in the kind of class which they denote we 
may predicate of a thing five different varieties of 
classname —

 names and propositions 

it is to be remarked of these distinctions that they 
express not what the predicate is in its own meaning 
but what relation it bears to the subject of which it 
happens on the particular occasion to be predicated 
there are not some names which are exclusively 
genera and others which are exclusively species or 
diflferentise but the same name is referred to one or 
another predicable according to the subject of which it 
is predicated on the particular occasion animal for 
instance is a genus with respect to man or john a 
species with respect to substance or being rec 
tangular is one of the diflferentiae of a geometrical 
square it is merely one of the accidentia of the 
table on which i am writing the words genus 
species c are therefore relative terms they are 
names applied to certain predicates to express the 
relation between them and some given subject a 
relation grounded as we shall see not upon what the 
predicate connotes but upon the class which it de 
notes and upon the place which in some given clas 
sification that class occupies relatively to the particular 
subject 

§ of these five names two genus and species 
are not only used by naturalists in a technical accep 
tation not precisely agreeing with their philosophical 
meaning but have also acquired a popular acceptation 
much more general than either in this popular

the same class which is a genus with reference to 
the subclasses or species included in it may be itself 
a species with reference to a more comprehensive or 
as it is often called a superior genus man is a 
species with reference to animal but a genus with 
reference to the species mathematician animal is a 
genus divided into two species man and brute but 
animal is also a species which with another species 
vegetable makes up the genus organized being

a species with respect to the superior genus animal 
taste is a genus divided into species but also a 
species of the genus sensation virtue a genus with 
reference to justice temperance c is one of the

in this popular sense the words genus and species 
have passed into common discourse and it should 
be observed that in ordinary parlance not the name 
of the class but the class itself is said to be the genus 
or species not of course the class in the sense of 
each individual of that class but the individuals 
collectively considered as an aggregate whole the 
names by which the class is designated being then 
called not the genus or species but the generic or 
specific name and this is an admissible form of 
expression nor is it of any importance which of the 
two modes of speaking we adopt provided the rest of 
our language is consistent with it but if we call the 
class itself the genus we must not talk of predicating 
the genus we predicate of man the name mortal

intelligible sense to predicate what the name ex 
presses the attribute mortality but in no allowable 
sense of the word predication do we predicate o man 
the class mortal we predicate of him the fact of 
belonging to the class 

by the aristotelian logicians the terms genus and 
species were used in a more restricted sense they 
did not admit every class which could be divided into 
other classes to be a genus or every class which could 
be included in a larger class to be a species animal 
was by them considered a genus and man and brute 
coordinate species under that genus biped would not 
have been admitted to be a genus with reference to 
man but a proprium or accidens only it was requi 
site according to their theory that genus and species 
should be of the essence of the subject animal was 
of the essence of man biped was not and in every 
classification they considered some one class as the 
lowest or infima species man for instance was a 
lowest species any further divisions into which the 
class might be capable of being broken down as man 
into white black and red man or into priest and 
layman they did not admit to be species 

it has been seen however in the preceding 
chapter that the distinction between the essence of a 
class and the attributes or properties which are not of 
its essence — a distinction which has given occasion to 
so much abstruse speculation and to which so mys 
terious a character was formerly and by many writers 
is still attached — amounts to nothing more than the 
difference between those attributes of the class which 
are and those which are not involved in the signifi 
cation of the classname as applied to individuals

in connexion with the exploded tenets of the realists 
and what the schoolmen chose to call the essence of 
an individual was simply the essence of the class to 
which that individual was most familiarly referred 

is there no difference then except this merely 
verbal one between the classes which the schoolmen 
admitted to be genera or species and those to which 
they refused the title is it an error to regard some 
of the differences which exist among objects as dif 
ferences in kind genere or specie and others only as 
differences in the accidents were the schoolmen 
right or wrong in giving to some of the classes into 
which things may be divided the name of kinds and 
considering others as secondary divisions grounded 
upon differences of a comparatively superficial nature 
examination will show that the aristotelians did mean 
something by this distinction and something im 
portant but which being but indistinctly conceived 
was inadequately expressed by the phraseology of 
essences and by the various other modes of speech to 
which they had recourse 

 it is a fundamental principle in logic that the 
power of framing classes is unlimited as long as there 
is any even the smallest difference to found a dis 
tinction upon take any attribute whatever and if 
some things have it and others have not we may 
ground upon the attribute a division of all things into 
two classes and we actually do so the moment we 
create a name which connotes the attribute the 
number of possible classes therefore is boundless 
and there are as many actual classes either of real or 
of imaginary things as there are general names posi 
tive and negative together

class sulphur or phosphorus or the class white or red 
and consider in what particulars the individuals in 
cluded in the class diflfer from those which do not 
come within it we find a very remarkable diversity in 
this respect between some classes and others there 
are some classes the things contained in which differ 
from other things only in certain particulars which 
maybe numbered while others differ in more than 
can be numbered more even than we need ever expect 
to know some classes have little or nothing in com 
mon to characterise them by except precisely what is 
connoted by the name white things for example are 
not distinguished by any common properties except 
whiteness or if they are it is only by such as are in 
some way dependent upon or connected with white 
ness but a hundred generations have not exhausted 
the common properties of animals or of plants of 
sulphur or of phosphorus nor do we suppose them to 
be exhaustible but proceed to new observations and 
experiments in the full confidence of discovering new 
properties which were by no means impued in those 
we previously knew while if any one were to 
propose for investigation the common properties of all 
things which are of the same colour the same shape 
or the same specific gravity the absurdity would be 
palpable we have no ground to believe that any such 
common properties exist except such as may be 
shown to be involved in the supposition itself or to 
be derivable from it by some law of causation it 
appears therefore that the properties on which we 
ground our classes sometimes exhaust all that the 
class has in common or contain it all by some mode 
of implication but in other instances we make a 
selection of a few properties from among not only a

far as we are concerned be regarded as infinite 

there is no impropriety in saying that of these 
two classifications the one answers to a much more 
radical distinction in the things themselves than the 
other does and if any one even chooses to say that 
the one classification is made by nature the other by 
us for our convenience he will be right provided he 
means no more than this — that where a certain appa 
rent difierence between things although perhaps in 
itself of little moment answers to we know not what 
number of other diflferences pervading not only their 
known properties but properties yet undiscovered it 
is not optional but imperative to recognise this differ 
ence as the foundation of a specific distinction while 
on the contrary differences that are merely finite and 
determinate like those designated by the words white 
black or red may be disregarded if the purpose for 
which the classification is made does not require 
attention to those particular properties the diflfer 
ences however are made by nature in both cases 
while the recognition of those differences as grounds 
of classification and of naming is equally in both 
cases the act of man only in the one case the ends 
of language and of classification would be subverted if 
no notice were taken of the difference while in the 
other case the necessity of taking notice of it depends 
upon the importance or unimportance of the parti 
cular qualities in which the difference happens to 
consist

aristotelian logicians were considered as genera or

property or properties and there terminated they 
considered as differences only in the accidents of things 
but where any class differed from other things by an 
infinite series of differences known and unknown 
they considered the distinction as one of wnd and 
spoke of it as being an essential difference which is 
also one of the usual meanings of that vague expres 
sion at the present day 

conceiving the schoolmen to have been justified 
in drawing a broad line of separation between these 
two kinds of classes and of classdistinctions i shall 
not only retain the division itself but continue to 
express it in their language according to that 
language the proximate or lowest kind to which 
any individual is referrable is called its species 
conformably to this sir isaac newton would be said

sir isaac newton also belongs as for example 
christian and englishman and mathematician but 
these though distinct classes are not in our sense of 
the term distinct kinds of men a christian for 
example differs from other human beings but he 
differs only in the attribute which the word expresses 
namely belief in christianity and whatever else that 
implies either as involved in the fact itself or con

be differences of kind within our meaning of the 
term i say they may be i do not say they are

that the differences which distinguish different races 
sexes c from one another follow as consequences 
under laws of nature from some one or a few primary 
lifferences which can be precisely determined and 
which as the phrase is account for all the rest if 
this be so these are not distinctions in kind no more

not capable of being accounted for then man and 
woman caucasian mongolian and negro c are 
really different kinds of human beings and entitled to 
be ranked as species by the logician though not by 
the naturalist for as already hinted the word 
species is used in a very different signification in logic 
and in natural history by the naturalist organized 
beings are never said to be of different species if it is 
supposed that they could possibly have descended 
from the same stock that however is a sense 
artificially given to the word for the technical pur 
poses of a particular science to the logician if a

that is if their differences are inexhaustible and not 
referrible to any common cause they are different 
species whether they are both descended from noah 
or not but if their differences can all be traced to 
climate and habits they are not in the logicians 
view specifically distinct 

when the infima species or proximate kind to 
which an individual belongs has been ascertained 
the properties common to that kind include necessa 
rily the whole of the common properties of every 
other real kind to which the individual can be refer 
rible let the individual for example be socrates 
and the proximate kind man animal or living 
creature is also a real kind and includes socrates 
but since it likewise includes man or in other words 
since all men are animals the properties common to 
animals form a portion of the common properties of 
the subclass man and if there be any class which 
includes socrates without including man that class is 
not a real kind let the class for example heflau

without including all men to determine whether it 
is a real kind we must ask ourselves this question

other than those which are common to all animals 
whatever if they had if a flat nose were a mark or 
index to an indefinite number of other peculiarities 
not deducible from the former by any ascertainable 
law then out of the class man we might cut another 
class flatnosed man which according to our defini 
tion would be a kind but if we could do this man 
would not be as it was assumed to be the proximate 
kind therefore the properties of the proximate kind

of all other kinds to which the individual belongs 
which was the point we undertook to prove and 
hence every other kind which is predicable of the 
individual will be to the proximate kind in the 
relation of a genus according to even the popular 
acceptation of the terms genus and species that is 
it will be a larger class including it and more 

we are now able to fix also the logical meaning of 
these terms every class which is a real kind that 
is which is distinguished from all other classes by an 
indeterminate multitude of properties not derivable 
from another is either a genus or a species a kind 
which is not divisible into other kinds cannot be a 
genus because it has no species under it but it is 
itself a species both with reference to the individuals 
below and to the genera above species prsedicabilis 
and species subjicibilis but every kind which 
admits of division into real kinds as animal into 
quadruped bird c or quadruped into various 
species of quadrupeds is a genus to all below it a 
species to all genera in which it is itself included and 
here we may close this part of the discussion and pass 
to the three remaining predicables differentia pro 
prium and accidens 

§ to begin with differentia this word is 
correlative with the words genus and species and as 
all agree it signifies the attribute which distinguishes 
a given species from every other species of the same 
genus this is so far clear but which of the distin 
guishing attributes does it signify for we have seen 
that every kind and a species must be a kind is 
distinguished from other kinds not by any one 
attribute but by an indefinite number man for 
instance is a species of the genus animal rational

or rationality for it is of no consequence whether 
we use the concrete or the abstract form is generally 
assigned by logicians as the differentia and doubtless 
this attribute serves the purpose of distinction but it 
has also been remarked of man that he is a cooking 
animal the only animal that dresses its food this 
therefore is another of the attributes by which the 
species man is distinguished from other species of the 
same genus would this attribute serve equally well 
for a differentia the aristotelians say no having 
laid it down that the differentia must like the genus 
and species be of the essence of the subject 

and here we lose even that vestige of a meaning 
grounded in the nature of the things themselves 
which may be supposed to be attached to the word 
essence when it is said that genus and species must 
be of the essence of the thing there can be no 
doubt that when the schoolmen talked of the essences 
of things as opposed to their accidents they had 
confusedly in view the distinction between differences 
of kind and the differences which are not of kind 
they meant to intimate that genera and species must 
be kinds their notion of the essence of a thing was 
a vague notion of a something which makes it what 
it is i ey which makes it the kind of thing that it is 
— which causes it to have all that variety of properties 
which distinguish its kind but when the matter 
came to be looked at more closely nobody could 
discover what caused the thing to have all those 
properties nor even that there was anything which 
caused it to have them logicians however not 
liking to admit this and being unable to detect what 
made the thing to be what it was satisfied themselves 
with what made it to be what it was called of the 
innumerable properties known and unknown that are

common to the class man a portion only and of 
course a very small portion are connoted by its name 
these few however will naturally have been thus 
distinguished from the rest either for their greater 
obviousness or for greater supposed importance 
these properties then which were connoted by the 
name logicians seized upon and called them the 
essence of the species and not stopping there they 
affirmed them in the case of the infima species to be 
the essence of the individual too for it was their 
maxim that the species contained the whole essence 
of the thing metaphysics that fertile field of 
delusion propagated by language does not afibrd a 
more signal instance of such delusion on this 
account it was that rationality being connoted by the 
name man was allowed to be a differentia of the class 
but the peculiarity of cooking their food not being 
connoted was relegated to the class of accidental 
properties 

the distinction therefore between differentia 
proprium and accidens is not founded in the nature 
of things but in the connotation of names and we 
must seek it there if we wish to find what it is 

from the fact that the genus includes the species 
in other words denotes more than the species or is 
predicable of a greater number of individuals it 
follows that the species must connote more than the 
genus it must connote all the attributes which the 
genus connotes or there would be nothing to prevent 
it from denoting individuals not included in the 
genus and it must connote something besides 
otherwise it would include the whole genus animal 
denotes all the individuals denoted by man and many 
more man therefore must connote all that animal 
connotes otherwise there might be men who were 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

not animals and it must connote something more 
than animal connotes otherwise all animals would be 
men this surplus of connotation — this which the 
species connotes over and above the connotation of 
the genus — is the differentia or specific difference 
or to state the same proposition in other words the 
differentia is that which must be added to the conno 
tation of the genus to complete the connotation of 
the species 

the word man for instance exclusively of what 
it connotes in common with animal also connotes 
rationality and at least some approximation to that 
external form which we all know but which as we 
have no name for it considered in itself we are 
content to call the human the differentia or specific 
difference therefore of man as referred to the genus 
animal is that outward form and the possession of 
reason the aristotelians said the possession of 
reason without the outward form but if they 
adhered to this they would have been obliged to call 
the houyhnhms men the question never arose and 
they were never called upon to decide how such a 
case would have affected their notion of essentiauty 
but so far as it is possible to determine how language 
would be used in a case which is purely imaginary 
we may say that the houyhnhms would not be called 
men and that the term man therefore requires other 
conditions besides rationality the schoolmen how 
ever were satisfied with taking such a portion of the 
differentia as sufficed to distinguish the species from 
all other existing things although by so doing they 
might not exhaust the connotation of the name 

§ and here to prevent the notion of differentia 
from being restricted within too narrow limits it is

classification and the predicable 

necessary to remark that a species even as referred 
to the same genus will not always have the same 
differentia but a different one according to the prin 
ciple and purpose which presides over the particular 
classification for example a naturalist surveys the 
various kinds of animals and looks out for the classi 
fication of them most in accordance with the order in 
which for zoological purposes it is desirable that his 
ideas should arrange themselves with this view he 
finds it advisable that one of his fundamental divisions 
should be into warmblooded and coldblooded animals 
or into animals which breathe with lungs and those 
which breathe with gills or into carnivorous and 
frugivorous or graminivorous or into those which 
walk on the flat part and those which walk on the 
extremity of the foot a distinction on which some of 
cuviers families are founded in doing this the 
naturalist creates as many new classes which are by 
no means those to which the individual animal is fami 
liarly and spontaneously referred nor should we ever 
think of assigning to them so prominent a position in 
our arrangement of the animal kingdom unless for a 
preconcerted purpose of scientific convenience and 
to the liberty of doing this there is no limit in the 
examples we have given the new classes are real 
kinds since each of the peculiarities is an index to a 
multitude of properties belonging to the class which 
it characterizes but even if the case were otherwise 
— if the other properties of those classes could all be 
derived by any process known to us from the one 
peculiarity on which the class is founded— even then 
if those derivative properties were of primary import 
ance for the purposes of the naturalist he would be 
warranted in founding his primary division upon 
them

if however practical convenience is a sufficient 
warrant for making the main demarcations in our 
arrangement of objects run in lines not coinciding 
with any distinction of kind and so creating genera 
and species in the popular sense which are not genera 
or species in the rigorous sense at all a fortiori must 
we be warranted when our genera and species are 
real genera and species in marking the distinction 
between them by those of their properties which 
considerations of practical convenience most strongly 
recommend if we cut a species out of a given 
genus — the species man for instance out of the genus 
animal — with an intention on our part that the pecu 
liarity by which we are to be guided in the application 
of the name man should be rationality then rationality 
is the differentia of the species man suppose how 
ever that being naturalists we for the purposes of 
our particular study cut out of the genus animal the 
same species man but with an intention that the 
distinction between man and all other species of 
animal should be not rationality but the possession 
of four incisors in each jaw tusks solitary and 
erect posture it is evident that the word man 
when used by us as naturalists no longer connotes 
rationality but connotes the three other properties 
specified for that which we have expressly in view 
when we impose a name assuredly forms part of the 
meaning of that name we may therefore lay it 
down as a maxim that wherever there is a genus and 
a species marked out from that genus by an assign 
able differentia the name of the species must be 
connotative and must connote the differentia but 
the connotation may be special not involved in the 
signification of the term as ordinarily used but given 
to it when employed as a term of art or science

the word man in common use connotes rationality 
and a certain form but does not connote the number 
or character of the teeth in the linnsean system it 
connotes the number of incisor and canine teeth but 
does not connote rationality nor any particular form 
the word man has therefore two different meanings 
although not commonly considered as ambiguous 
because it happens in both cases to cenote the same 
individual objects but a case is conceivable in which 
the ambiguity would become evident we have only 
to imagine that some new kind of animal were dis 
covered having linnaeuss three characteristics of 
humanity but not rational or not of the human form 
in ordinary parlance these animals would not be called 
men but in natural history they must still be called 
so by those if any there be who adhere to the 
linnaean classification and the question would arise 
whether the word should continue to be used in two 
senses or the classification be given up and the 
technical sense of the term be abandoned along 
with it 

words not otherwise connotative may in the mode 
just adverted to acquire a special or technical conno

remarked connotes nothing it merely denotes the 
attribute corresponding to a certain sensation but if 
we are making a classification of colours and desire 
to justify or even merely to point out the particular 
place assigned to whiteness in our arrangement we 
may define it the colour produced by the mixture 
of all the simple rays and this fact though by no 
means implied in the meaning of the word whiteness

ticular occasion we are rderring it 

 having disposed of genus species and 
differentia we shall not find much difficulty in attain 
ing a clear conception of the distinction between the 
other two predicables 

in the aristotelian phraseology genus and dif 
ferentia are of the essence of the subject by which as 
we have seen is really meant that the properties 
signified by the genus and those signified by the 
differentia form part of the connotation of the name 
denoting the species prrium and acddens on the 
other hand form no part of the essence but are 
predicated of the species only accidentally both are 
accidents in the wider sense in which the accidents of 
a thing are opposed to its essence although in the 
doctrine of the predicables accidens is used for one 
sort of accident only proprium being another sort 
proprium continue the schoolmen is predicated 
accidentally y indeed but necessarily or as they fur 
ther explain it signifies an attribute which is not

any way applicable to attributes it of course follows that although 
attributes may be put into classes those classes can be admitted to

indeed part of the essence but which flows from or 
is a consequence of the essence and is therefore 
inseparably attached to the species e g the various 
properties of a triangle which though no part of its 
definition must necessarily be possessed by whatever 
comes under that definition accidens on the con 
trary has no connexion whatever with the essence 
but may come and go and the species still remain 
what it was before if a species could exist without 
its propria it must be capable of existing without that 
upon which its propria are necessarily consequent 
and therefore without its essence without that which 
constitutes it a species but an accidens whether 
separable or inseparable from the species in actual 
experience may be supposed separated without the 
necessity of supposing any other alteration or at 
least without supposing any of the essential properties 
of the species altered since with them an accidens has 
no connexion 

a proprium therefore of the species may be 
defined any attribute which belongs to all the indi 
viduals included in the species and which although 
not connoted by the specific name either ordinarily 
if the classification we are considering be for ordinary 
purposes or specially if it be for a special purpose 
yet follows from some attribute which the name either 
ordinarily or specially connotes 

one attribute may follow from another in two 
ways and there are consequently two kinds of pro 
prium it may follow as a conclusion follows pre 
misses or it may follow as an effect follows a cause 
thus the attribute of having the ojsite sides equal 
which is not one of those connoted by the word 
parallelogram nevertheless fouows from those con 
noted by it namely from having the opposite sides

straight lines and parallel and the number of sides 
four the attribute therefore of having the oppo 
site sides equal is a proprium of the class paral 
lelogram and a proprium of the first kind which 
follows from the connoted attributes by way of demon 
stratiotu the attribute of being capable of under 
standmg language is a proprium of the species man 
since without being connoted by the word it follows 
from an attribute which the word does connote viz 
from the attribute of rationality but this is a pro 
prium of the second kind which follows by way of 
causation how it is that one property of a thmg 
follows or can be inferred from another under what 
conditions this is possible and what is the exact 
meaning of the phrase are among the questions 
which will occupy us in the two succeeding books 
at hesent it needs only be said that whether a pro 
prium follows by demonstration or by causation it 
follows necessarily that is to say it cannot but 
follow consistently with some law which we regard 
as a part of the constitution either of our thinking 
faculty or of the universe 

§ under the remaining predicable accidens are 
included all attributes of a thing which are neither 
involved in the signification of the name whether 
ordinarily or as a term of art nor have so far as we 
know any necessary connexion with attributes which 
are so involved they are commonly divided into 
separable and inseparable accidents inseparable 
accidents are those which — although we know of no

we are aware they might be absent without making

a concise mode of expressing the same meaning is 
that inseparable accidents are properties which are 
miiversal to the species but not necessary to it thus 
blackness is an attribute of a crow and as far as we 
know an universal one but if we were to discover 
a race of white birds in other respects resembling 
crows we should not say these are not crows we 
should say these are white crows crow therefore 
does not connote blackness nor from any of the 
attributes which it does connote whether as a word 
in popular use or as a term of art could blackness be 
inferred not only therefore can we conceive a 
white crow but we know of no reason why such an 
animal should not exist since however none but 
black crows are known to exist blackness in the 
present state of our knowledge ranks as an accident 
but an inseparable accident of the species crow 

separable accidents are those which are found in 
point of fact to be sometimes absent from the species 
which are not only not necessary but not even uni 
versal they are such as do not belong to every 
individual of the species but only to some individuals 
or if to all not at all times thus the colour of an 
european is one of the separable accidents of the 
species man because it is not an attribute of all 
human creatures being bom is also a separable 
accident of the species man because although an 
attribute of all human beings it is so only at one par 
ticular time a fortiori those attributes which are 
not constant even in the same individual as to be in 
one or in another place to be hot or cold sitting or 
walking must be ranked as separable accidents

chapter viii 
of definition 

§ one necessary part of the theory of names 
and of propositions remains to be treated of in this 
place the theory of definitions as being the most 
important of the class of propositions which we have 
characterised as purely verbal they have already 
received some notice in the chapter preceding the 
last bat their fuller treatment was at that time 
postponed because definition is so closely connected 
with classification that until the nature of the latter 
process is in some measure understood the former 
cannot be discussed to much purpose 

 the simplest and most correct notion of a 
definition is a proposition declaratory of the meaning 
of a word namely either the meaning which it 
bears in common acceptation or that which the 
speaker or writ for the particular purposes of his 
discourse intends to annex to it 

the definition of a word being the proposition 
which enunciates its meaning words which have no 
meaning are unsusceptible of definition proper 
names therefore cannot be defined a proper name 
being a mere mark put upon an individual and of 
which it is the characteristic property to be destitute 
of meaning its meaning cannot of course be declared 
though we may indicate by language as we might 
indicate still more conveniently by pointing with the 
finger upon what individual that particular mark has 
been or is intended to be put it is no definition of

definition 

 john thomson to say he is the son of general 
thomson for the name john thomson does not 
express this neither is it any definition of john 
thomson to say he is the man now crossing the 
street these propositions may serve to make 
known who is the particular man to whom the name 
belongs but that may be done still more unambi 
guously by pointing to him which however has not 
usually been esteemed one of the modes of definition 

in the case of connotative names the meaning as 
has been so often observed is the connotation and 
the definition of a connotative name is the proposition 
which declares its connotation this may be done 
either directly or indirectly the direct mode would 
be by a proposition in this form man or what 
soever the word may be is a name connoting such 
and such attributes or is a name which when 
predicated of anything signifies the possession of such 
and such attributes by that thing or thus man 
is everything which possesses such and such attri 
butes man is everything which possesses corporeity 
organization life rationality and a form resembling 
that of the descendants of adam 

this form of definition is the most precise and 
least equivocal of any but it is not brief enough and 
is besides too technical and pedantic for common 
discourse the more usual mode of declaring the 
connotation of a name is to predicate of it another 
name or names of known signification which connote 
the same aggregation of attributes this may be 
done either by predicating of the name mtended to be 
defined another connotative name exacuy synony 
mous as man is a human being which is not 
commonly accounted a defiilition at all or by pre 
dicating two or more connotative names which make

 names and propositions 

up among them the whole connotation of the name to 
be defined in this last case again we may either 
compose our definition of as many connotative names 
as there are attributes each attribute being connoted 
by one as man is a corporeal organised animated 
rational being shaped so and so or we may employ 
names which connote several of the attributes at once 
as man is a rational animal shaped so and so 

the definition of a name according to this view of 
it is the sum total of all the essential propositions 
which can be framed with that name for their subject 
all propositions the truth of which is implied in the 
name all those which we are made aware of by merely 
hearing the name are included in the definition if 
complete and may be evolved from it without the aid 
of any other premisses whether the definition ex 
presses them in two or three words or in a larger 
number it is therefore not without reason that 
condillac and other writers have affirmed a definition 
to be an analysis to resolve any complex whole 
into the elements of which it is compounded is the 
meaning of analysis and this we do when we replace 
one word which connotes a set of attributes collec 
tively by two or more which connote the same attri 
butes singly or in smaller groups 

§ from this however the question naturally 
arises in what manner are we to define a name which 
connotes only a single attribute for instance white 
which connotes nothing but whiteness rational 
which connotes nothing but the possession of reason 
it might seem that the meaning of such names could 
only be declared in two ways by a synonymous term 
if any such can be found or in the direct way already 
alluded to white is a name connoting the attribute 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

whiteness let us see however whether the ana 
lysis of the meaning of the name that is the break 
ing down of that meaning into separate parts admits 
of being carried fiarther without at present deciding 
this question as to the word white it is obvious that 
in the case of rational some further explanation may 
be given of its meaning than is contanied in the 
proposition rational is that which possesses the 
attribute of reason since the attribute reason itself 
admits of being defined and here we must turn our 
attention to the definitions of attributes or rather of 
the names of attributes that is of abstract names 

in regard to such names of attributes as are conno 
tative and express attributes of those attributes there 
is no difficulty like other connotative names they are 
defined by declaring their connotation thus the word 
fault may be defined a quality productive of evil or 
inconvenience sometimes again the attribute to 
be defined is not one attribute but an union of 
several we have only therefore to put together the 
names of all the attributes taken separately and we ob 
tain the definition of the names which belong to them 
all taken together a definition which will correspond 
exactly to that of the corresponding concrete name 
for as we define a concrete name by enumerating the 
attributes which it connotes and as the attributes con 
noted by a concrete name form the entire signification 
of the corresponding abstract one the same enumera 
tion will serve for the definition of both thus if the 
definition of a human being be this a being corpo 
real animated rational and shaped so and so the 
definition of humanity will be corporeity and animal 
life combined with rationality and with such and such 
a shape 

when on the other hand the abstract name does

 names and propositions 

not express a complication of attributes but a single 
attribute we must remember that every attribute is 
groimded upon some fact or phenomenon from which 
and which alone it derives its meaning to that fact 
or phenomenon called in a former chapter the 
foundation of the attribute we must therefore have 
recourse for its definition now the foundation of 
the attribute may be a phenomenon of any degree of 
complexity consisting of many different parts either 
coexistent or in successioil to obtain a definition of 
the attribute we must analyse the phenomenon into 
these part eloquence for example is the name of 
one attribute only but this attribute is grounded 
upon external effects of a complicated nature flowing 
from acts of the person to whom we ascribe the 
attribute and by resolving this phenomenon of 
causation into its two parts the cause and the effect 
we obtain a definition of eloquence viz the power of 
influencing the affections of human beings by means of 
speech or writing 

a name theiefore whether concrete or abstract 
admits of definition provided we are able to analyse 
that is to distinguish into parts the attribute or set of 
attributes which constitute the meaning both of the 
concrete name and of the corresponding abstract 
if a set of attributes by enumerating them if a 
single attribute by dissecting the fact or phenomenon 
whether of perception or of internal consciousness 
which is the foundation of the attribute but further 
even when the fact is one of our simple feelings or 
states of consciousness and therefore unsusceptible 
of analysis the names both of the object and of the 
attribute still admit of definition or rather would do 
so if all our simple feelings had names whiteness 
may be defined the property or power of exciting the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

sensation of white a white object may be defined 
an object which excites the sensation of white the 
only names which are unsusceptible of definition 
because their meaning is unsusceptible of analysis are 
the names of the simple feelings themselyes these 
are in the same condition as proper names they are 
not indeed like proper names unmeanmg for the 
words sensation of white signify that the sensation 
which i so denominate resembles other sensations 
which i remember to have had before and to have 
called by that name but as we have no words by 
which to recal those former sensations except the 
very word which we seek to define or some other 
which being exactly synonymous with it requires 
definition as much words cannot unfold the significa 
tion of this class of names and we are obliged to 
make a direct appeal to the personal experience of the 
individual whom we address 

 having stated what seems to be the true idea 
of a definition we proceed to examine some opinions 
of philosophers and some popular conceptions on the 
subject which conflict more or less with the above 

the only adequate definition of a name is as already 
remarked one which declares the facts and the whole 
of the facts which the name involves in its significa 
tion but with most persons the object of a defini 
tion does not embrace so much they look for nothing 
more in a definition than a guide to the correct use of 
the term — a protection against applying it in a manner 
inconsistent with custom and convention anything 
therefore is to them a sufficient definition of a term 
which will serve as a correct index to what the term 
denotes although not embracing the whole and 
sometimes perhaps not even any part of what it 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

connotes this gives rise to two sorts of imperfect 
or unscientific definitions namely essential but incom 
plete definitions and accidentaldefinitionsor descrip 
tions in the former a connotative name is defined by 
a part only of its connotation in the latter by some 
thing which forms no part of the connotation at all 

an example of the first kind of imperfect defini 
tions is the following — man is a rational animal it 
is impossible to consider this as a complete defini 
tion of the word man since as before remarked if 
we adhered to it we should be obliged to call the 
houyhnhms men but as there happen to be no 
houyhnhms this imperfect definition is sufficient to 
mark out and distinguish from all other things the 
objects at present denoted by •man all the beings 
actually known to exist of whom the name is predi 
cable though the word is defined by some only 
among the attributes which it connotes not by all it 
happens that all known objects which possess the 
enumerated attributes possess also those which are 
omitted so that the field of predication which the 
word covers and the employment of it which 
conformable to usage are as well indicated by the 
inadequate definition as by an adequate one such 
definitions however are always liable to be overthrown 
by the discovery of new objects in nature 

definitions of this kind are what logicians have 
had in view when they laid down the rule that the 
definition of a species should be per genus et different 
tiara differentia being seldom taken to mean the 
whole of the peculiarities constitutive of the species 
but some one of those peculiarities only a complete 
definition would be per genus et differentiasy rather 
than differentiam it would include with the name 
of the superior genus not merely some attribute which 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

distinguishes the species intended to be defined from 
all other species of the same genus but all the attri 
butes implied in the name of the species which the 
name of the superior genus has not already implied 
the assertion however that a definition must of 
necessity consist of a genus and differentiae is not 
tenable it was early remarked by logicians that the 
summum genus in any classification having no genus 
superior to itself could not be defined in this manner 
yet we have seen that all names except those of our 
elementary feelings are susceptible of definition in the 
strictest sense by setting forth in words the con 
stituent parts of the fact or phenomenon of which 
the connotation of every word is ultimately composed 

 although the first kind of imperfect defini 
tion which defines a connotative term by a part only 
of what it connotes but a part sufficient to mark out 
correctly the boundaries of its denotation has been 
considered by the ancients and by logicians in general 
as a complete definition it has always been deemed 
necessary that the attributes employed should really 
form part of the connotation for the rule was that 
the definition must be drawn from the essence of the 
class and this would not have been the case if it had 
been in any degree made up of attributes not con 
noted by the name the second kind of imperfect 
definition therefore in which the name of a class is 
defined by any of its accidents — that is by attributes 
which are not included in its connotation — has been 
rejected from the rank of genuine definition by all 
philosophers and has been termed description 

this kind of imperfect definition however takes 
its rise from the same cause as the other namely the 
willingness to accept as a definition anything which 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

whether it expounds the meaning of the name or not 
enables us to discriminate the things denoted by the 
name from all other things and consequently to 
employ the term in predication without deviating 
from established usse this purpose is duly an 
swered by stating any no matter what of the attri 
butes which are common to the whole of the class 
and peculiar to it or any combination of attributes 
which may happen to be peculiar to it although sepa 
rately each of those attributes may be common to it 
with some other things it is only necessary that the 
definition or description thus formed should be con 
vertible with the name which it professes to define 
that is should be exactly coextensive with it being 
predicable of everything of which it is predicable and 
of nothing of which it is not predicable although the 
attributes specified may have no connexion with those 
which men had in view when they formed or recog 
nised the class and gave it a name the following 
are correct definitions of man according to this test 
man is a mammiferous animal having by nature two 
hands for the human species answers to this descrip 
tion and no other animal does man is an animal 
who cooks his food man is a featherless biped 

what would otherwise be a mere description may 
be raised to the rank of a real definition by the pecu 
liar purpose which the speaker or writer has in view 
as was seen in the preceding chapter it may for the 
ends of a particular art or science or for the more 
convenient statement of an authors particular views 
be advisable to give to some general name without 
altering its denotation a special connotation different 
from its ordinary one when this is done a definition 
of the name by means of the attributes which make up 
the special connotation though in general a mere acci

dbpinition 

dental definition or descriptiod becomes on the par 
ticular occasion and for the particular purpose a com 
plete and genuine definition this actually occurs 
with respect to one of the preceding examples man is 
a mammiferous animal having two hands which is the 
scientific definition of man considered as one of the 
species in cuviers distribution of the animal kingdom 
in cases of this sort although the definition is 
still a declaration of the meaning which in the parti 
cular instance the name is appointed to convey it 
cannot be said that to state the meaning of the word 
is the purpose of the definition the purpose is not 
to expound a name but to help to expound a classifi 
cation the special meaning which cuvier assigned 
to the word man quite foreign to its ordinary 
meaning though involving no change in the denota 
tion of the word was incidental to a plan of arranging 
animals into classes on a certain principle that is 
according to a certain set of distinctions and since 
the definition of man according to the ordinary conno 
tation of the word though it would have answered 
every other purpose of a definition would not have 
pointed out the place which the species ought to occupy 
in that particular classification he gave the word a 
special connotation that he might be able to define it 
by the kind of attributes upon which for reasons of 
scientific convenience he had resolved to found his 
division of animated nature 

scientific definitions whether they are definitions 
of scientific terms or of common terms used in a 
scientific sense are almost always of the kind last 
spoken of their main purpose is to serve as the 
landmarks of scientific classification and since the 
classifications in any science are continually modified 
as scientific knowledge advances the definitions in the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

sciences are also constantly varying a striking 
instance is afforded by the words acid and alkali 
especially the former as experimental discovery 
advanced the substances classed with acids have 
been constantly multiplying and by a natural conse 
quence the attributes connoted by the word have 
receded and become fewer at first it connoted the 
attributes of combining with an alkali to form a 
neutral substance called a salt being compounded of 
a base and oxygen causticity to the taste and touch 
fluidity c the true analysis of muriatic acid into 
chlorine and hydrogen caused the second property 
composition from a base and oxygen to be excluded 
from the connotation the same discovery fixed the 
attention of chemists upon hydrogen as an important 
element in acids and more recent discoveries having 
led to the recognition of its presence in sulphuric 
nitric and many other acids where its existence was 
not previously suspected there is now a tendency to 
include the presence of this element in the connotation 
of the word but carbonic acid silica sulphurous 
acid have no hydrogen in their composition that 
property cannot therefore be connoted by the term 
unless those substances are no longer to be considered 
acids causticity and fluidity have long since been 
excluded from the characteristics of the class by the 
inclusion of silica and many other substances in it 
and the formation of neutral bodies by combination 
with alkalis together with such electrochemical pecu 
liarities as this is supposed to imply are now the 
only differentue which form the fixed connotation of 
the word acid as a term of chemical science 

scientific men are still seeking and may be long 
ere they find a suitable definition of one of the 
earliest words in the vocabulary of the human race 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

and one of those of which the popular sense is plainest 
and best understood the word i mean is heat and 
the source of the diflsculty is the imperfect state of 
our scientific knowledge which has shown to us mul 
titudes of phenomena certainly connected with the 
same power which is the cause of what our senses 
recognise as heat but has not yet taught us the laws 
of those phenomena with sufiicient accuracy to admit 
of our determining under what characteristics the 
whole of those phenomena shall ultimately be embo 
died as a class which characteristics would of course 
be so many differentiae for the definition of the power 
itself we have advanced far enough to know that 
one of the attributes connoted must be that of ope 
rating as a repulsive force but this is certainly not 
all which must ultimately be included in the scientific 
definition of heat 

what is true of the definition of any term of 
science is of course true of the definition of a science 
itself and accordingly we showed in the introduc 
tory chapter of this work that the definition of a 
science must necessarily be progressive and provisional 
any extension of knowledge or alteration in the 
current opinions respecting the subject matter may 
lead to a change more or less extensive in the parti 
culars included in the science and its composition 
being thus altered it may easily happen that a different 
set of characteristics will be found better adapted as 
differentiae for defining its name 

in the same manner in which as we have now 
shown a special or technical definition has for its 
object to expound the artificial classification out of 
which it grows the aristotelian logicians seem to have 
imagined that it was also the business of ordinary 
definition to expound the ordinary and what they

 names and propositions 

deemed the natural classification of things namely 
the division of them into kinds and to show the place 
which each kind occupies as superior collateral or 
subordinate among other kinds this notion would 
account for the rule that all definition must necessarily 
be per genus et differentiam and would also explain 
why any one differentia was deemed sufficient but 
to expound or express in words a distinction of kind 
has already been shown to be an impossibility the 
very meaning of a kind is that the properties which 
distinguish it do not grow out of one another and 
cannot therefore be set forth in words even by impli 
cation otherwise than by enumerating them all and 
all are not known nor ever will be so it is idle 
therefore to look to this as one of the purposes of a 
definition while if it be only required that the defi 
nition of a kind should indicate what kinds include 
it or are included by it any definitions which expound 
the connotation of the names will do this for the name 
of each class must necessarily connote enough of its 
properties to fix the boundaries of the class if the 
definition therefore be a full statement of the connota 
tion it is all that a definition can be required to be 

§ of the two incomplete or unscientific modes 
of definition and in what they diflfer from the com 
plete or scientific mode enough has now been said 
we shall next examine an ancient doctrine once 
generally prevalent and still by no means exploded 
which i regard as the source of a great part of the 
obscurity hanging over some of the most important 
processes of the understanding in the pursuit of 
truth according to this the definitions of which we 
have now treated are only one of two sorts into which 
definitions may be divided viz definitions of names 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

and definitions of things the former are intended to 
explain the meaning of a term the latter the nature 
of a thing the last being incomparably the most 
important 

this opinion was held by the ancient philosophers 
and by their followers with the exception of the nomi 
nalists but as the spirit of modern metaphysics 
until a recent period has been on the whole a nomi 
nalist spirit the notion of definitions of things has 
been to a certain extent in abeyance still continuing 
however to breed confusion in logic by its conse 
quences indeed rather than by itself yet the doctrine 
in its own proper form now and then breaks out and 
has appeared among other places where it was 
scarcely to be expected in a deservedly popular work 
archbishop whatelys logic in a review of that 
work published by me in the westmiiister review for 
january and containing some opinions which 
i no longer entertain i find the following observa 
tions on the question now before us observations 
with which my present views on that question are 
still sufficiently in accordance 

 the distinction between nominal and real defini 
tions between definitions of words and what are 
called definitions of things though conformable to the 
ideas of most of the aristotelian logicians cannot as 
it appears to us be maintained we apprehend that 
no definition is ever intended to explain and unfold 
the nature of the thing it is some confirmation of 
our opinion that none of those writers who have 
thought that there were definitions of things have 
ever succeeded in discovering any criterion by which 
the definition of a thing can be distinguished from any 
other proposition relating to the thing the defini 
tion they say unfolds the nature of the thing but 

dipiz by google 



 names and propositions 

no definition can unfold its whole nature and every 
proposition in which any quality whatever is predi 
cated of the thing unfolds some part of its nature 
the true state of the case we take to be this all 
definitions are of names and of names only but in 
some definitions it is clearly apparent that nothing is 
intended except to explain the meaning of the word 
while in others besides explaining the meaning of the 
word it is intended to be implied that there exists a 
thing corresponding to the word whether this be 
or be not implied in any given case cannot be col 
lected from the mere form of the expression a cen 
taur is an animal with the upper parts of a man and 
the lower parts of a horse and a triangle is a 
rectilineal figure with three sides are in form expres 
sions precisely similar although in the former it is 
not implied that any things conformable to the term 
really exists while in the latter it is as may be seen 
by substituting in both definitions the word means 
for is in the first expression a centaur means an 
animal c the sense would remain unchanged in 
the second a triangle means c the meaning 
would be altered since it would be obviously impos 
sible to deduce any of the truths of geometry from a 
proposition expressive only of the manner in which 
we intend to employ a particular sign 

 there are therefore expressions commonly pass 
ing for definitions which include in themselves more 
than the mere explanation of the meaning of a term 
but it is not correct to call an expression of this sort 
a peculiar kind of definition its difierence from the 
other kind consists in this that it is not a definition 
but a definition and something more the definition 
above given of a triangle obviously comprises not 
one but two propositions perfectly distinguishable 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

the one is there may exist a figure bounded by 
three straight lines the other and this figure may 
be termed a triangle the former of these proposi 
tions is not a definition at all the latter is a mere 
nominal defimtion or explanation of the use and 
appucation of a term the first is susceptible of 
truth or falsehood and may therefore be made the 
foundation of a train of reasoning the latter can 
neither be true nor false the only character it is 
susceptible of is that of conformity or disconformity 
to the ordinary usage of language 

there is a real distinction then between defini 
tions of names and what are erroneously called defi 
nitions of things but it is that the latter along with 
the meaning of a name covertly asserts a matter of 
fact this covert assertion is not a definition but a 
postulate the definition is a mere identical pro 
position which gives information only about the use 
of language and from which no conclusions affecting 
matters of fact can possibly be drawn the accom 
panying postulate on the other hand affirms a fact 
which may lead to consequences of every degree of 
importance it affirms the real existence of things 
possessing the combination of attributes set forth in the 
definition and this if true maybe foundation sufficient 
on which to build a whole fabric of scientific truth 

we have already made and shall often have to 
repeat the remark that the philosophers who over 
threw realism by no means got rid of the conse 
quences of realism but retained long afterwards in 
their own philosophy numerous propositions which 
could only have a rational meaning £is part of a realistic 
system it had been handed down from aristotle 
and probably from earlier times as an obvious truth 
that the science of geometry is deduced from defini

 names and propositions 

tions this so long as a definition was considered 
to be a proposition unfolding the nature of the 
thing did well enough but hobbes came and 
rejected utterly the notion that a definition declares 
the nature of the thing or does anything but state 
the meaning of a name yet he continued to affirm as 
broadly as any of his predecessors that the ax 
principiay or original premisses of mathematics and 
even of all science are definitions producing the 
singular paradox that systems of scientific truth nay 
all truths whatever at which we arrive by reasoning 
are deduced from the arbitrary conventions of man 
kind concerning the signification of words 

to save the credit of the doctrine that definitions 
are the premisses of scientific knowledge the proviso 
is sometimes added that they are so only under a 
certain condition namely that they be framed con 
formably to the phenomena of nature that is that 
they ascribe such meanings to terms as shall suit 
objects actually existing but this is only an instance 
of the attempt too often made to escape from the 
necessity of abandoning old language after the ideas 
which it expresses have been exchanged for contrary 
ones from the meaning of a name we are told it 
is possible to infer physical facts provided the name 
has corresponding to it an existing thing but if 
this proviso be necessary from which of the two is 
the inference really drawn from the existence of a 
thing having the properties or from the existence of 
a name meaning them 

take for instance any of the definitions laid down 
as premisses in euclids elements the definition let 
us say of a circle this being analyzed consists of 
two propositions the one an assumption with respect 
to a matteroffact the other a genuine definition

definition 

 a figure may exist having all the points in the line 
which bounds it equally distant from a single point 
within it any figure possessing this property is 
called a circle let us look at one of the demon 
strations which are said to depend on this definition 
and observe to which of the two propositions contained 
in it the demonstration really appeals about the 
centre a describe the circle bcd here is an 
assumption that a figure such as the definition 
expresses may be described which is no other than 
the postulate or covert assumption involved in the 
socalled definition but whether that figure be called 
a circle or not is quite immaterial the purpose 
would be as well answered in all respects except brevity 
were we to say through the point b draw a line 
returning into itself of which every point shall be at 
an equal distance from the point a by this the 
definition of a circle would be got rid of and rendered 
needless but not the postulate implied in it without 
that the demonstration could not stand the circle 
being now described let us proceed to the conse 
quence since b c d is a circle the radius b a is 
equal to the radius ca b a is equal to ca not 
because b c d is a circle but because b c d is a figure 
with the radii equal our warrant for assuming that 
such a figure about the centre a with the radius 
b a may be made to exist is the postulate — the 
admissibility of these assumptions may be intuitive 
or may admit of proof but in either case they are 
the premisses on which the theorems depend and 
while these are retained it would make no diflference 
in the certainty of geometrical truths though every 
definition in euclid and every technical term therein 
defined were laid aside

a distinction obvious as it may appear has been

the purpose of rendering such mistakes impossible in 
future we will therefore detain the reader while 
we point out one of the absurd consequences flowing 
from the supposition that definitions as such are the 
premisses in any of our reasonings except such as 
relate to words only if this supposition were true 
we might argue correctly from true premisses and 
arrive at a false conclusion we should only have to 
assume as a premiss the definition of a nonentity 
or rather of a name which has no entity corresponding 
to it let this for instance be our definition 
a dragon is a serpent breathing flame 
this proposition considered only as a definition is 
indisputably correct a dragon is a serpent breathing 
flame the word means that the tacit assumption 
indeed if there were any such understood assertion 
of the existence of an object with properties cor 
responding to the definition would in the present 
instance be false out of this definition we may 
carve the premisses of the following syllogism 

a dragon is a thing which breathes flame 

but a dragon is a serpent 
from which the conclusion is 

therefore some serpent or serpents breathe 
flame — 
an unexceptionable syllogism in the first mode of 
the third figure in which both premisses are true and 
yet the conclusion false which every logician knows 
to be an absurdity the conclusion being false and 
the syllogism correct the premisses cannot be true 
but the premisses considered as parts of a definition

are true there is no possibility of controverting 
them therefore the premisses considered as parts of 
a definition cannot be the real ones the real pre 
misses must be 

a dragon is a really eadsting thing which breathes 
flame 

a dragon is a really existing serpent 
which implied premisses being false the falsity of the 
conclusion presents no absurdity if we would 
determine what conclusion follows from the same 
ostensible premisses when the tacit assumption of real 
existence is left out let us according to the recom 
mendation in the westminster review substitute means 
for is we then have 

a dragon is a word meaning a thing which breathes 
flame 

a dragon is a word meaning a serpent 
from which the conclusion is 

some word or words which mean a serpent also 
mean a thing which breathes flame 
where the conclusion as well as the premisses is 
true and is the only kind of conclusion which can 
ever follow from a definition namely a proposition 
relating to the meaning of words if it relate to 
anything else we may know that it does not follow 
from the definition but from the tacit assumption of 
a matter of fact 

it is only necessary further to inquire in what 
cases that tacit assumption is really made and in 
what cases not unless we declare the contrary we 
always convey the impression that we intend to make 
the assumption when we profess to define any name 
which is already known to be a name of really existing 
objects on this account it is that the assumption 
was not necessarily implied in the definition of a

dragon while there was no doubt of its being included 
in the definition of a circle 

§ one of the circumstances which have con 
tributed to keep up the notion that demonstrative 
truths follow from definitions rather than from the 
postulates implied in those definitions is that the 
postulates even in those sciences which are consi 
dered to surpass all others in demonstrative certainty 
are not always exactly true it is not true that a 
circle exists or can be described which has all its 
radii exactly equal such accumcy is ideal only it is 
not found in nature still less can it be realised by art 
people had a difficulty therefore in conceiving that 
the most certain of all conclusions could rest upon 
premisses which instead of being certainly true are 
certainly not true to the whole extent asserted this 
apparent paradox will be examined when we come to 
treat of demonstration where we shall be able to show 
that as much of the postulate is true as is required 
to support as much as is true of the conclusion 
philosophers however to whom this view had not 
occurred or whom it did not satisfy have thought it 
indispensable that there should be found in definitions 
something more certain or at least more accurately 
true than the implied postulate of the real existence 
of a corresponding object and this something they 
flattered themselves they had found when they laid it 
down that a definition is a statement and analysis 
not of the mere meaning of a word nor yet of the 
nature of a thing but of an idea thus the pro 
position a circle is a plane figure bounded by a line 
all the points of which are at an equal distance from 
a given point within it was considered by them not 
as an assertion that any real circle has that property 

digitized by vjooq ic 



definition 

which would not be exactly true but that we conceive 
a circle as having it that our abstract idea of a circle 
is an idea of a figure with its radii exactly equal 

conformably to this it is said that the subject 
matter of mathematics and of every other demonstra 
tive science is not things as they really exist but 
abstractions of the mind a geometrical line is a line 
without breadth but no such line exists in nature it is 
a mere notion made up by the mind out of the materials 
in nature the definition it is said is a definition of 
this mental line not of any actual line and it is only 
of the mental line not of any line existing in nature 
that the theorems of geometry are accurately true 

allowing this doctrine respecting the nature of 
demonstrative truth to be correct which in a sub 
sequent place i shall endeavour to prove that it is 
not even on that supposition the conclusions which 
seem to follow from a definition do not follow from 
the definition as such but from an implied postulate 
even if it be true that there is no object in nature 
answering to the definition of a line and that the 
geometrical properties of lines are not true of any 
lines in nature but only of the idea of a line the 
definition at all events postulates the real existence 
of such an idea it assumes that the mind can frame 
or rather has framed the notion of length without 
breadth and without any other sensible property 
whatever according to what appears to me the 
sounder opinion the mind cannot form any such 
notion it cannot conceive length without breadth it 
can only in contemplating objects attend to their 
length exclusively of their other sensible qualities 
and so determine what properties may be predicated 
of them in virtue of their length alone if this be 
true the postulate involved in the geometrical defi

 names and propositions 

nition of a line is the real existence not of length 
without breadth but merely of length that is of long 
objects this is quite enough to support all the 
truths of geometry since every property of a geo 
metrical line is really a property of all physical objects 
possessing length but even what i hold to be the 
false doctrine on the subject leaves the conclusion 
that our reasonings are grounded upon the matters of 
fact postulated in definitions and not upon the defini 
tions themselves entirely unaffected and accordingly 
i am able to appeal in confirmation of this conclusion 
to the authority of mr whewell in his recent treatise 
on the philosophy of the inductive sciences on the 
nature of demonstrative truth mr whewells opinions 
are greatly at variance with mine but on the par 
ticular point in question it gives me great pleasure to 
observe that there is a complete agreement between us 
and here as in many other instances i gladly acknow 
ledge that his writings are eminently serviceable in 
clearing from confusion the initial steps in the analysis 
of the mental processes even where his views respect 
ing the ultimate analysis a matter generally of far less 
importance are such as though with unfeigned respect 
i cannot but regard as fundamentally erroneous 

§ although according to the views here pre 
sented definitions are properly of names only and 
not of things it does not follow that definition is an 
easy matter how to define a name may not only be 
an inquiry of considerable difficulty and intricacy but 
may turn upon considerations going deep into the 
nature of the things which are denoted by the name 
such for instance are the inquiries which form the 
subjects of the most important of platos dialogues

 what is justice that of the republic such also 
is the question scornfully asked by pilate what is 
truth and the fundamental question with speculative 
moralists in all ages what is virtue 

it would be a mistake to represent these difficult 
and noble inquiries as having nothing in view beyond 
ascertaining the conventional meaning of a name 
they are inquiries not so much to determine what is 
as what should be the meaning of a name which like 
other practical questions of terminology requires for 
its solution that we should enter and sometimes enter 
very deeply into the properties not merely of names 
but of the things named 

although the meaning of every concrete general 
name resides in the attributes which it connotes the 
objects were named before the attributes as appears 
from the fact that in all languages abstract names are 
mostly compounds or derivatives of the concrete 
names which correspond to them connotative 
names therefore were after proper names the first 
which were used and in the simpler cases no doubt 
a distinct connotation was present to the minds of 
those who first used the name and was distinctly 
intended by them to be conveyed by it the first 
person who used the word whitcy as applied to snow 
or to any other object knew no doubt very well what 
quality he intended to predicate and had a perfectly 
distinct conception in his mind of the attribute sig 
nified by the name 

but where the resemblances and differences on 
which our classifications are founded are not of this 
palpable and easily determinable kind especially where 
they consist not in any one quauty but in a number 
of qualities the effects of which being blended toge 
ther are not very easily discriminated and referred

 names and propositions 

each to its true source it often happens that names 
are applied to nameable objects with no distinct 
connotation present to the minds of those who apply 
them they are only influenced by a general resem 
blance between the new object and all or some of the 
old familiar objects which they have been accustomed 
to call by that name this as we have seen is the 
law which even the mind of the philosopher must 
follow in giving names to the simple elementary 
feelings of our nature but where the things to be 
named are complex wholes a philosopher is not con 
tent with noticing a general resemblance he examines 
what the resemblance consists in and he only gives 
the same name to things which resemble one another 
in the same definite particulars the philosopher 
therefore habitually employs his general names with 
a definite connotation but language was not made 
and can only in some small degree be mended by 
philosophers in the minds of the real arbiters of 
language general names especially where the classes 
they denote cannot be brought before the tribunal of 
the outward senses to be identified and discriminated 
connote little more than a vague gross resemblance to 
the things which they were earliest or have been 
most accustomed to call by those names when for 
instance ordinary persons predicate the words just or 
unjust of any action noble or mean of any senti 
ment expression or demeanour statesman or charlatan 
of any personage figuring in politics do they mean to 
aflirm of those various subjects any determinate 
attributes of whatever kind no they merely 
recognise as they think some likeness more or less 
vague and loose between them and some other things 
which they have been accustomed to denominate or to 
hear denominated by those appellations

language as sir james mackintosh used to say 
of governments is not made but grows a name 
is not imposed at once and by previous purpose upon 
a class of objects but is first applied to one thing 
and then extended by a series of transitions to another 
and another by this process as has been remarked 
by several writers and illustrated with great force and 
clearness by dugald stewart in his philosophical 
essays a name not unfrequently passes by successive 
links of resemblance from one object to another 
until it becomes applied to things having nothing in 
common with the first things to which the name was 
given which however do not for that reason drop 
the name so that it at last denotes a confused huddle 
of objects having nothing whatever in common and 
connotes nothing not even a vague and general resem 
blance when a name has fallen into this state in 
which by predicating it of any object we assert 
literally nothing about the object it has become 
unfit for the purposes either of thought or of the 
communication of thought and can only be made 
serviceable by stripping it of some part of its multi 
farious denotation and confining it to objects pos 
sessed of some attributes in common which it may be 
made to connote such are the inconveniences of a 
language which is not made but grows like a 
road which is not made but has made itself it requires 
continual mending in order to be passable 

from this it is already evident why the question 
respecting the definition of an abstract name is often 
one of so much difficulty the question what is 
justice is in other words what is the attribute 
which mankind mean to predicate when they call an 
action just to which the first answer is that having 
come to no precise agreement on the point they do 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 names and propositions 

not mean to predicate distinctly any attribute at all 
nevertheless all believe that there is some common 
attribute belonging to all the actions which they are 
in the habit of calling just the question then must 
be whether there is any such common attribute 
and in the first place whether mankind agree suffi 
ciently with one another as to the particular actions 
which they do or do not call just to render the 
inquiry what quality those actions have in common 
a possible one if so whether the actions really have 
any quality in common and if they have what it is 
of these three the first alone is an inquiry into usage 
and convention the other two are inquiries into 
matters of fact and if the second question whether 
the actions form a class at all has been answered 
negatively there remains a fourth often more arduous 
than all the rest namely how best to form a class 
artificially which the name may denote 

and here it is fitting to remark that the study of 
the spontaneous growth of languages is of the utmost 
importance to the philosopher who would logically 
remodel them the classifications judely made by 
established language when retouched as they almost 
always require to be by the hands of the logician are 
often in themselves excellently suited to many of his 
purposes when compared with the classifications of 
a philosopher they are like the customary law of a 
country which has grown up as it were sponta 
neously compared with laws methodized and digested 
into a code the former are a far less perfect instru 
ment than the latter but being the result of a long 
though unscientific course of experience they contain 
the greater part of the materials out of which the 
systematic body of written law may and ought to be 
formed in like manner the established grouping of

objects under a common name though it may be 
founded only upon a gross and general resemblance 
is evidence in the first place that the resemblance is 
obvious and therefore considerable and in the next 
place that it is a resemblance which has struck great 
numbers of persons during a series of years and ages 
even when a name by successive extensions has 
come to be applied to things among which there does 
not exist even a gross resemblance common to them 
all still at every step in its progress we shall find such 
a resemblance and these transitions of the mean 
ing of words are often an index to real connexions 
between the things denoted by them which might 
otherwise escape the notice even of philosophers of 
those at least who from using a different language or 
from any difference in their habitual associations 
have fixed their attention in preference upon some 
other aspect of the things the history of philosophy 
abounds in examples of such oversights which would 
not have been committed if a philosopher had seen 
the hidden link that connected together the seemingly 
disparate meanings of some ambiguous word 



 few people i have said in another place have reflected 
how great a knowledge of things is required to enable a man to 
affirm that any given argument turns wholly upon words there 
isy perhaps not one of the leading terms of philosophy which is 
not used in almost innumerable shades of meaning to express ideas 
more or less widely different from one another between two of 
these ideas a sagacious and penetrating mind will discern as it 
were intuitively an unobvious link of connection upon which 
though perhaps unable to give a logical account of it he will found 
a perfectly valid argument which his critic not having so keen an 
insight into the things will mistake for a fallacy turning on the 
double meaning of a term and the greater the genius of him 
who thus safely leaps over the chasm the greater will probably be 
the crowing and vainglory of the mere logician who hobbling

whenever the inquiry into the definition of the 
name of any real object consists of anything else than 
a mere comparison of authorities we tacitly assume 
that a meaning must be found for the name compa 
tible with its continuing to denote if possible all but 
at any rate the greater or the more important part 
of the things of which it is commonly predicated 
the inquiry therefore into the definition is an 
inquiry into the resemblances and difierences among 
those things whether there be any resemblance 
running through them all if not through what 
portion of them such a general resemblance can be 
traced and finally what are the common attributes 
the possession of which gives to them all or to that 
portion of them the character of resemblance which 
has led to their being classed together when these 
common attributes have been ascertained and speci 
fied the name which belongs in common to the 
resembling objects acquires a distinct instead of a 
vague connotation and by possessing this distinct 
connotation becomes susceptible of definition 

in giving a distinct connotation to the general 
name the philosopher will endeavour to fix upon such 
attributes as while they are common to all the things 
usually denoted by the name are also of greatest 
importance in themselves either directly or from 
the number the conspicuousness or the interesting 
character of the consequences to which they lead 
he will select as far as possible such differentia as 
lead to the greatest number of interesting propria

chapter i 
of inference or reasoning in general 

§ in the preceding book we have been occupied 
not with the nature of proof but with the nature of 
assertion the import conveyed by a proposition 
whether that proposition be true or false not the 
means by which to discriminate true from false pro 
positions the proper subject however of logic is 
proof before we could understand what proof is 
it was necessary to imderstand what that is to which 
proof is applicable what that is which can be a subject 
of belief or disbelief of affirmation or denial what in 
short the different kinds of propositions assert 

this preliminary inquiry we have prosecuted to a 
lefinite result assertion in the first place relates 
•ither to the meaning of words or to some property 
of the things which words signify assertions re 
specting the meaning of words among which defini 
tions are the most important hold a place and an 
indispensable one in philosophy but as the meaning 
of words is essentially arbitrary this class of assertions 
are not susceptible of truth or falsity nor therefore 
of proof or disproof assertions respecting things 
or what may be called real propositions in contra 
distinction to verbal ones are of various sorts we 
have analyzed the import of each sort and have ascer 
tained the nature of the things they relate to and 
the nature of what they severally assert respecting 
those things we found that whatever be the form 
of the proposition and whatever its nominal subject 
or predicate the real subject of every proposition is

 reasoning 

some one or more facts or phenomena of consciousness 
or some one or more of the hidden causes or powers to 
which we ascribe those facts and that what is pre 
dicated or asserted either in the affirmative or negative 
of those phenomena or those powers is always either 
existence order in place order intime causation or 
resemblance this then is the theory of the import 
of propositions reduced to its ultimate elements but 
there is another and a less abstruse expression for it 
which though stopping short in an earlier stage of the 
analysis is sufficiently scientific for many of the pur 
poses for which such a general expression is required 
this expression recognises the commonly received 
distinction between subject and attribute and gives 
the following as the analysis of the meaning of pro 
positions — every proposition asserts that some given 
given subject does or does not possess some attribute 
or that some attribute is or is not either in all or 
in some portion of the subjects in which it is met 
with conjoined with some other attribute 

we shall now for the present take our leave of 
this portion of our inquiry and proceed to the peculiar 
problem of the science of logic namely how the 
assertions of which we have analysed the import are 
proved or disproved such of them at least as not 
being amenable to direct consciousness or intuition 
are appropriate subjects of proof 

we say of a fact or statement that it is proved 
when we believe its truth by reason of some other 
fact or statement from which it is said to follow most 
of the propositions whether affirmative or negative 
universal particular or singular which we believe 
are not believed on their own evidence but on the 
ground of something previously assented to and from 
which they are said to be inferred to infer a pro

position from a previous proposition or propositions 
to give credence to it or claim credence for it as a 
conclusion from something else is to reason in the 
most extensive sense of the term there is a narrower 
sense in which the name reasoning is confined to the 
form of inference which is termed ratiocination and 
of which the syllogism is the general type the 
reasons for not conforming to this restricted use of 
the term were stated in an early stage of our inquiry 
and additional motives will be suggested by the con 
siderations on which we are now about to enter 

 in proceeding to take into consideration the 
cases in which inferences can legitimately be drawn 
we shall first mention some cases in which the infe 
rence is apparent not real and which require notice 
chiefly that they may not be confounded with cases of 
inference properly so called this occurs when the 
proposition ostensibly inferred from another appears 
on analysis to be merely a repetition of the same or 
part of the same assertion which was contained in 
the first all the cases mentioned in books of logic 
as examples of iequipollency or equivalence of pro 
positions are of this nature thus if we were to 
argue no man is incapable of reason for every man 
is rational or all men are mortal for no man is 
exempt from death it would be plain that we were not 
proving the proposition but only appealing to another 
mode of wording it which may or may not be more 
readily comprehensible by the hearer or better adapted 
to suggest the real proof but which contains in itself 
no shadow of proof 

another case is where from an universal proposi 
tion we affect to infer another which differs from it 
only in being particular as all a is b therefore 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

some a is b no a is b therefore some a is not b 
this too is not to conclude one proposition from 
another but to repeat a second time something which 
had been asserted at first with the diflference that 
we do not here repeat the whole of the previous asser 
tion but only an indefinite part of it 

a third case is where the antecedent having 
affirmeji a predicate of a given subject the conse 
quent affirms of the same subject something akeady 
connoted by the former predicate as socrates is a 
man therefore socrates is a living creature where 
all that is connoted by living creature was affirmed of 
socrates when he was asserted to be a man if the 
propositions are negative we must invert their order 
thus socrates is not a living creature therefore he 
is not a man for if we deny the less the greater 
which includes it is already denied by implication 
these therefore are not really cases of inference 
and yet the trivial examples by which in manuals of 
logic the rules of the syllogism are illustrated are 
often of this illchosen kind demonstrations in form 
of conclusions to which whoever understands the 
terms used in the statement of the data has already 
and consciously assented 

the most complex case of this sort of apparent 
inference is what is called the conversion of proposi 
tions which consists in making the predicate become 
a subject and the subject become a predicate and 
framing out of the same terms thus reversed another 
proposition which must be true if the former is true 
thus from the particular affirmative proposition some 
a is b we may infer that some b is a from the 
universal negative no a is b we may conclude that 
no b is a from the universal affirmative proposi 
tion all a is b it cannot be inferred that all b is a

inference in general 

though all water is liquid it is not implied that all 
liquid is water but it is implied that some liquid is 
so and hence the proposition all a is b is legiti 
mately convertible into some b is a this process 
which converts an universal proposition into a parti 
cular is termed conversion per accidens from the 
proposition some a is not b we cannot even infer 
that some b is not a though some men are not 
englishmen it does not follow that some englishmen 
are not men the only legitimate conversion if such 
it can be called of a particular negative proposition 
is in the form some a is not b therefore something 
which is not b is a and this is termed conversion 
by contraposition in this case however the predi 
cate and subject are not merely reversed but one of 
them is altered instead of aj and b the terms 
of the new proposition are a thing which is not b 
and a the original proposition some a is not b 
is first changed into a proposition aequipollent with it 
some a tf a thing which is not b and the pro 
position being now no longer a particular negative 
but a particular affirmative admits of conversion in 
the first mode or as it is called simple conversion 

in all these cases there is not really any inference 
there is in the conclusion no new truth nothing but 
what was already asserted in the premisses and obvious 
to whoever apprehends them the fact asserted in 
the conclusion is either the very same fact or part of 
the fact asserted in the original proposition this 
follows from our previous analysis of the import of 
propositions when we say for example that some 
lawfiil sovereigns are tyrants what is the meaning of 
the assertion that the attributes connoted by the 
term lawful sovereign and the attributes connoted 
by the term tyrant sometimes coexist in the same

 rbasonino 

iudividual now this is also precisely what we mean 
when we say that some tyrants are lawful sovereigns 
which therefore is not a second proposition inferred 
from the first any more than the english translation 
of euclids elements is a collection of theorems 
different from and consequences of those contained 
in the greek original again if we assert that no 
great general is a fool we mean that the attributes 
connoted by great general and those connoted by 
 fool never coexist in the same subject which is 
also the exact meaning which we express when we 
say that no fool is a great general when we say 
that all quadrupeds are warmblooded we assert not 
only that the attributes connoted by quadruped 
and those connoted by warmblooded sometimes 
coexist but that the former never exist without the 
latter now the proposition some warmblooded 
creatures are quadrupeds expresses the first half of 
this meaning dropping the latter half and therefore 
has been already affirmed in the antecedent proposi 
tion all quadrupeds are warmblooded but that all 
warmblooded creatures are quadrupeds or in other 
words that the attributes connoted by warmblooded 
never exist without those connoted by quadruped 
has not been asserted and cannot be inferred in 
order to reassert in an inverted form the whole of 
what was affirmed in the proposition all quadrupeds 
are warmblooded we must convert it by contraposi 
tion thus nothing which is not warmblooded is a 
quadruped this proposition and the one fiom which 
it is derived are exactly equivalent and either of them 
may be substituted for the other for to say that 
when the attributes of a quadruped are present those 
of a warmblooded creature are present is to say that 
when the latter are absent the former are absent

inference in general 

in a manual for young students it would be 
proper to dwell at greater length upon the conversion 
and aequipouency of propositions for although that 
cannot be called reasoning or inference which is a 
mere reassertion in different words of what had been 
asserted before there is no more important intellectual 
habit nor any the cultivation of which falls more 
strictly within the province of the art of logic than 
that of discerning rapidly and surely the identity of 
an assertion when disguised imder diversity of ian 
guage that important chapter in logical treatises 
which relates to the opposition of propositions and 
the excellent technical language which logic provides 
for distinguishing the different kinds or modes of 
opposition are of use chiefly for this purpose such 
considerations as these that contrary propositions 
may both be false but cannot both be true that 
subcontrary propositions may both be true but 
cannot both be felse that of two contradictory pro 
positions one must be true and the other false that 
of two subaltemate propositions the truth of the 
universal proves the truth of the particular and the 
falsity of the particular proves the falsity of the 
universal but not vice versd are apt to appear at

explained seem almost too obvious to require so 
formal a statement since the same amount of expla 
nation which is necessary to make the principles 
intelligible would enable the truths which they 
convey to be apprehended in any particular case 
which can occur in this respect however these 
axioms of logic are on a level with those of mathe 
matics that things which are equal to the same 
thing are equal to one another is as obvious in any 
particular case as it is in the general statement and 
if no such general maxim had ever been laid down 
the demonstrations in euclid would never have halted 
for any difficulty in stepping across the gap which 
this axiom at present serves to bridge over yet 
no one bas ever censured writers on geometry for 
placing a list of these elementary generalizations at 
the head of their treatises as a first exercise to the 
learner of the faculty which will be required in him at 
every step that of apprehending a general truth 
and the student of logic in the discussion even of 
such truths as we have cited above acquires habits of 
circumspect interpretation of words and of exactly 
measuring the length and breadth of his assertions 
which are among the most indispensable conditions of 
any considerable attainment in science and which it 
is one of the primary objects of logical discipune to 
cultivate 

§ having noticed in order to exclude from the 
province of reasoning or inference properly so called 
the cases in which the progress from one truth to 
another is only apparent the logical consequent being 
a mere repetition of the logical antecedent we now 
pass to those which are cases of inference in the 
proper acceptation of the term those in which we set

inference in general 

out from known truths to arrive at others really 
distinct from them 

reasoning in the extended sense in which i use 
the term and in which it is synonymous with 
inference is popularly said to be of two kinds 
reasoning from particulars to generals and reason 
ing from generals to particulars the former being 
called induction the latter ratiocination or syllogism 
it will presently be shown that there is a third species 
of reasoning which falls under neither of these 
descriptions and which nevertheless is not only 
valid but the foundation of both the others 

it is necessary to observe that the expressions 
reasoning from particulars to generals and reasoning 
from generals to particulars are recommended by 
brevity rather than by precision and do not ade 
quately mark without the aid of a commentary the 
distinction between induction and ratiocination the 
meaning intended by these expressions is that induc 
tion is inferring a proposition from propositions less 
general than itself and ratiocination is inferring a 
proposition from propositions equally or more general 
when from the observation of a number of individual 
instances we ascend to a general proposition or when 
by combining a number of general propositions we 
conclude from them another proposition still more 
general the process which is substantially the same 
in both instances is called induction when from a 
general proposition not alone for from a single 
proposition nothing can be concluded which is not 
involved in the terms but by combining it with other 
propositions we infer a proposition of the same degree 
of generality with itself or a less general proposition 
or a proposition merely individual the process is 
ratiocination when in short the conclusion is

 reasoning 

more general than the largest of the premisses the 
argument is commonly called induction when less 
general or equally general it is ratiocination 

as all experience begins with individual cases and 
proceeds from them to generals it might seem most 
conformable to the natural order of thought that 
induction should be treated of before we touch upon 
ratiocination it will however be advantageous in 
a science which aims at tracing our acquired know 
ledge to its sources that the inquirer should com 
mence with the later rather than with the earlier 
stages of the process of constructing our knowledge 
and should trace derivative truths backward to the 
truths from which they are deduced and upon which 
they depend for their evidence before attempting to 
point out the original spring from which both ulti 
mately take their rise the advantages of this order 
of proceeding in the present instance will manifest 
themselves as we advance in a manner superseding the 
necessity of any further justification or explanation 

of induction therefore we shall say no more at 
present than that it at least is without doubt a 
process of real inference the conclusion in an 
induction embraces more than is contained in the 
premisses the principle or law collected from par 
ticular instances the general proposition in which we 
embody the result of our experience covers a much 
larger extent of ground than the individual experi 
ments which are said to form its basis a principle 
ascertained by experience is more than a mere 
summing up of what we have specifically observed in 
the individual cases that we have examined it is a 
generalisation grounded on those cases and expressive 
of our belief that what we there found true is true 
in an indefinite number of cases which we have not

examined and are never likely to examine the 
nature and grounds of this inference and the condi 
tions necessary to make it legitimate will be the 
subject of discussion in the third book but that 
such inference really takes place is not susceptible of 
question in every induction we proceed from truths 
which we knew to truths which we did not know 
from facts certified by observation to facts which we 
have not observed and even to facts not capable of 
being now observed future facts for example but 
which we do not hesitate to believe upon the sole 
evidence of the induction itself 

induction then is a real process of reasoning or 
inference whether and in what sense so much can 
be said of the syllogism remains to be determined by 
the examination into which we are about to enter

chapter ii 
of ratiocination or syllogism 

 the analysis of the syllogism has been so 
accurately and fiilly performed in the common manuals 
of logic that in the present work which is not 
designed as a manual it is sufficient to recapitulate 
memorub causdy the leading results of that analysis 
as a foundation for the remarks to be afterwards made 
upon the functions of the syllogism and the place 
which it holds in philosophy 

to a legitimate syllogism it is essential that there 
should be three and no more than three propositions 
namely the conclusion or proposition to be proved 
and two other propositions which together prove it 
and which are called the premisses it is essential 
that there should be three and no more than three 
terms namely the subject and predicate of the con 
clusion and another called the middleterm which 
must be found in both premisses since it is by means 
of it that the other two terms are to be connected 
together the predicate of the conclusion is called 
the major term of the syllogism the subject of the 
conclusion is called the minor term as there can 
be but three terms the major and minor terms must 
each be found in one and only one of the premisses 
together with the middleterm which is in them both 
the premiss which contains the middleterm and the 
major term is called the major premiss that which 
contains the middleterm and the minor term is called 
the minor premiss of the syllogism 

syllogisms are divided by some logicians into

ratiocination or syllogism 



 



three figuresy by others into four according to the 
position of the middleterm which may either be the 
subject in both premisses the predicate in both or 
the subject in one and the predicate in the other 
the most common case is that in which the middle 
term is the subject of the major premiss and the 
predicate of the minor this is reckoned as the first 
figure when the middleterm is the predicate in 
both premisses the syllogism belongs to the second 
figure when it is ihe subject in both to the third 
in the fourth figure the middleterm is the subject of 
the minor premiss and the predicate of the major 
those writers who reckon no more than three figures 
include this case in the first 

each figure is subdivided into modes according to 
what are called the quantity and quality of the propo 
sitions that is according as they are universal or 
particular affirmative or negative the following are 
examples of all the legitimate modes that is all those 
in which the conclusion correctly follows from the 
premisses a is the minor term c the major b the 
middleterm

in these exemplars or blank forms for making 
syllogisms no place is assigned to singular propo 
sitions not of course because such propositions are 
not used in ratiocination but because their predicate 
being aflsrmed or denied of the whole of the subject 
they are ranked for the purposes of the syllogism 
with universal propositions thus these two syllo 
gisms — 

all men are mortal all men are mortal 

all kings are men socrates is a man 

therefore therefore 

all kings are mortal socrates is mortal 

are arguments precisely similar and are both ranked 
in the first mode of the first figure 

the reasons why syllogisms in any of the above 
forms are legitimate that is why if the premisses be 
true the conclusion must necessarily be so and why 
this is not the case in any other possible mode that 
is in any other combination of universal and par 
ticular affirmative and negative propositions any 
person taking interest in these inquiries may be pre 
sumed to have either learnt from the common school 
books of the syllogistic logic or to be capable of 
divining for himself the reader may however be 
referred for every needful explanation to archbishop 
whatelys elements of logic where he will find 
stated with philosophical precision and explained 
with peculiar perspicuity the whole of the common 
doctrine of the syllogism

ratiocination or syllogism 

all valid ratiocination all reasoning by which 
from general propositions previously admitted other 
propositions equally or less general are inferred may 
be exhibited in some of the above forms the whole 
of euclid for example might be thrown without 
difficulty into a series of syllogisms regular in mode 
and figure 

although a syllogism framed according to any of 
these formulae is a vaud argument all correct ratioci 
nation admits of being stated in syllogisms of the 
first figure along the niles for throwing an argu 
ment in any of the other figures into the first figure 
are called rules for the reduction of syllogisms it is 
done by the conversixm of one or other or both of the 
premisses thus an argument in the first mode of 
the second figure as — 

no c is b 

all a is b 

therefore 

no a is c 

may be reduced as follows the proposition no c 
is b being an universal negative admits of simple 
conversion and may be changed into no b is c 
which as we showed is the very same assertion in 
other words — the same fact differently expressed this 
transformation having been effected the argument 
assumes the following form — 

no b is c 

all a is b 

therefore 

no a is c 

which is a good syllogism in the second mode of the 
first figure again an argument in the first mode of 
the third figure must resemble the following —

 reasoning 

ah b is c 
all b is a 
therefore 
some a is c 
where the minor premiss all b is a conformably to 
what was laid down in the last chapter respecting 
universal afltanatives does not admit of simple con 
version but may be converted per acddens thus 
some a is b which though it does not express the 
whole of what is asserted in the proposition all b is 
a expresses as was formerly shown part of it and 
must therefore be true if the whole is true we have 
then as the result of the reduction the following 
syllogism in the third mode of the first figure — 
aubisc 
some a is b 
from which it obviously follows that 
some a is c 
in the same manner or in a manner on which 
after these examples it is not necessary to enlarge 
every mode of the second third and fourth figures 
may be reduced to some one of the four modes of the 
first in other words every conclusion which can be 
proved in any of the last three figures may be proved 
in the first figure from the same premisses with a 
slight alteration in the mere manner of expressing 
them every valid ratiocination therefore may be 
stated in the first figure that is in one of the follow 
ing forms — 

every b is c no b is c

or if more significant symbols are preferred — 

to prove an affirmative the argument must admit 
of being stated in this form — 



au animals are mortal 
all men 
some men 
socrates 

therefore 
all men 
some men 
socrates 



are animals 



are mortal 



to prove a negative the argument must be capable 
of beijqg expressed in this form — 

no one who is capable of selfcontrol is necessarily 
vicious 

all negroes 

some negroes are capable of selfcontrol 

mr as negro j 

therefore 
no negroes are 

some negroes are not i necessarily vicious 
mr a negro is not j 

although all ratiocination admits of being thrown 
into one or the other of these forms and sometimes 
gains considerably by the transformation both in 
clearness and in the obviousness of its consequence 
there are no doubt cases in which the argument falls 
more naturally into one of the other three figures and 
in which its conclusiveness is more apparent at the 
first glance in those figures than when reduced into 
the first thus if the proposition were that pagans 
may be virtuous and the evidence to prove it were

figure 

aristides was virtuous 
aristides was a pagan 

therefore 
some pagan was virtuous 

would be a more natural mode of stating the argu 
ment and would carry conviction more instantly 
home than the same ratiocination strained into the 
first figure thus — 

aristides was virtuous 
some pagan was aristides 

therefore 
some pagan was virtuous 

a german philosopher lambert whose neues 
organon published in the year contains among 
other things the most elaborate and complete expo 
sition of the syllogistic doctrine which i have hap 
pened to meet with has expressly examined what 
sorts of arguments fall most naturally and suitably

the reference of syllogisms in the last three figures to the dictum 
de omni et ntdlo is in lamberts view strained and unnatural to

same iu whichever figure it is expressed since as we 
have already seen the premisses of a syllogism in the 
second third or fourth figure and those of the syllo 
gism in the first figure to which it may be reduced 
are the same premisses in everything except language 
or at least as much of them as contributes to the 
proof of the conclusion is the same we are there 
fore at uberty in conformity with the general opinion 
of logicians to consider the two elementary forms of 
the first figure as the universal types of all correct 
ratiocination the one when the conclusion to be 
proved is affirmative the other when it is negative 
even though certain arguments may have a tendency 
to clothe themselves in the forms of the second third 
and fourth figures which however cannot possibly 
happen with the only class of arguments which are of 
firstrate scientific importance those in which the 
conclusion is an universal affirmative such conclu 
sions being susceptible of proof in the first figure 
alone 

§ on examining then these two general 
formulae we find that in both of them one premiss 
the major is an universal proposition and according

were it not that the views i am about to propound on the 
functions and ultimate foundation of the syllogism render such 
distinctions as these of very subordinate importance i should have 
availed myself largely of this and other speculations of lambert 
who has displayed within the limits of the received theory of the 
syllogism an originality for which it was scarcely to be supposed 
that there could still have been room on so exhausted a subject 
and whose book may be strongly recommended to those who may 
attempt still further to improve the excellent manuals we already 
possess of this elementary portion of the art of reasoning

 reasoning 

as this is affirmative or negative the conclusion is so 
too all ratiocination therefore starts from a general 
proposition principle or assumption a proposition 
in which a predicate is affirmed or denied of an entire 
class that is in which some attribute or the nega 
tion of some attribute is asserted of an indefinite 
nimiber of objects distinguished by a common charac 
teristic and designated in consequence by a common 
name 

the other premiss is always affirmative and 
asserts that something which may be either an indi 
vidual a class or part of a class belongs to or is 
included in the class respecting which something 
was affirmed or denied in the major premiss it 
follows that the attribute affirmed or denied of the 
entire class may if there was truth in that affirmation 
or denial be affirmed or denied of the object or 
objects alleged to be included in the class and this 
is precisely the assertion made in the conclusion 

whether or not the foregoing is an adequate 
account of the constituent parts of the syllogism will 
be presently considered but as far as it goes it is a 
true account it has accordingly been generalized 
and erected into a logical maxim on which all ratio 
cination is said to be founded insomuch that to 
reason and to apply the maxim are supposed to be 
one and the same thing the maxim is that what 
ever can be affirmed or denied of a class may be 
affirmed or denied of everything included in the 
class this axiom supposed to be the basis of the 
syllogistic theory is termed by logicians the dictum 
de omni et nullo 

this maxim however when considered as a prin 
ciple of reasoning appears suited to a system of meta 
physics once indeed generally received but which for

the last two centuries has been considered as finally 
abandoned though there have not been wantmg in 
our own day attempts at its revival so long as what 
were termed universals were regarded as a peculiar 
kind of substances having an objective existence 
distinct from the individual objects classed under 
them the dictum de omni conveyed an important 
meaning because it expressed the intercommunity of 
nature which it was necessary upon that theory that 
we should suppose to exist between those general 
substances and the particular substances which were 
subordinated to them that everything predicable of 
the universal was predicable of the various individuals 
contained under it was then no identical proposition 
but a statement of what was conceived as a funda 
mental law of the universe the assertion that the 
entire nature and properties of the substantia secunda 
formed part of the properties of each of the individual 
substances called by the same name that the pro 
perties of man for example were properties of all 
men was a proposition of real significance when man 
did not mean all men but something inherent in men 
and vastly superior to them in dignity now how 
ever when it is known that a class an universal a 
genus or species is not an entity per se but neither 
more nor less than the individual substances them 
selves which are placed in the class and that there is 
nothing real in the matter except those objects a 
common name given to them and common attributes 
indicated by the name what i should be glad to 
know do we learn by being told that whatever can 
be affirmed of a class may be affirmed of every object 
contained in the class the class is nothing but the 
objects contained in it and the dictum de omni merely 
amounts to the identical proposition that whatever is

true of certain objects is true of each of those objects 
if all ratiocination were no more than the application 
of this maxim to particular cases the syllogism would 
indeed be what it has so often been declared to be 
solemn trifling the dictum de omni is on a par with 
another truth which in its time was also reckoned of 
great importance whatever is is and not to be 
compared in point of significance to the cognate 
aphorism it is impossible for the same thing to be 
and not to be since this is at the lowest equivalent 
to the logical axiom that contradictory propositions 
cannot both be true to give any real meaning to 
the dictum de omni we must consider it not as an 
axiom but as a definition we must look upon it as 
intended to explain in a circuitous and paraphrastic 
manner the meaning of the word class 

an error which seemed finally refuted and dis 
lodged from science often needs only put on a new 
suit of phrases to be welcomed back to its old 
quarters and allowed to repose unquestioned for 
another cycle of ages modem philosophers have not 
been sparing in their contempt for the scholastic 
dogma that genera and species are a pecuuar kind of 
substances which general substances being the only 
permanent things while the individual substances 
comprehended under them are in a perpetual flux 
knowledge which necessarily imports stability can 
only have relation to those general substances or 
universals and not to the facts or particulars included 
under them yet though nominally rejected this 
very doctrine whether disguised under the abstract 
ideas of locke whose speculations however it has

the later kantians has never ceased to poison philo 
sophy once accustomed to consider scientific inves 
tigation as essentially consisting in the study of 
universals men did not drop this habit of thought 
when they ceased to regard universals as possessing 
an independent existence and even those who went 
the length of considering them as mere names could 
not free themselves from the notion that the investi 
gation of truth consisted entirely or partly in some 
kind of conjuration or juggle with those names when 
a philosopher adopted fully the nominalist view of 
the signification of general language retaining along 
with it the dictum de omni as the foundation of all 
reasoning two such premisses fairly put together were 
likely if he was a consistent thinker to land him in 
rather startling conclusions accordingly it has been 
seriously held by writers of deserved celebrity that 
the process of arriving at new truths by reasoning 
consists in the mere substitution of one set of arbi 
trary signs for another a doctrine which they sup 
posed to derive irresistible confirmation from the 
example of algebra if there were any process in 
sorcery or necromancy more preternatural than this 
i should be much surprised the culminating point 
of this philosophy is the noted aphorism of condillac 
that a science is nothing or scarcely anjrthing but 
une langue bien faite in other words that the one 
sufficient rule for discovering the nature and proper 
ties of objects is to name them properly as if the 
reverse were not the truth that it is impossible to 
name them properly except in proportion as we are 
already acquainted with their nature and properties

was or could be originally got at by any conceivable 
manipulation of mere names and that what can be 
learnt from names is only what somebody who used 
the names knew before philosophical analysis con 
firms the indication of common sense that the function 
of names is but that of enabling us to remember and to 
communicate our thoughts that they also strengthen 
even to an incalculable extent the power of thought 
itself is most true but they do this by no intrinsic 
and peculiar virtue they do it by the power inherent 
in an artificial memory an instrument of which few 
have adequately considered the immense potency 
as an artificial memory language truly is what it 
has so often been called an instrument of thought 
but it is one thing to be the instrument and another 
to be the exclusive subject upon which the instrument 
is exercised we think indeed to a considerable 
extent by means of names but what we think of are 
the things called by those names and there cannot 
be a greater error than to imagine that thought can 
be carried on with nothing in our mind but names 
or that we can make the names think for us 

§ those who considered the dictum de omni as 
the foundation of the syllogism looked upon argu 
ments in a manner corresponding to the erroneous 
view which hobbes took of propositions because 
there are some propositions which are merely verbal 
hobbes in order apparently that his definition 
might be rigorously universal defined a proposition 
as if no propositions declared anything except the 
meaning of words if hobbes was right if no

of propositions no theory could be given but the

ratiocination or syllogism 

commonly received one of the combination of propo 
sitions in a syllogism if the minor premiss asserted 
nothing more than that something belongs to a class 
and if as consistency would require us to suppose 
the major premiss asserted nothing of that class 
except that it is included in another class the conclu 
sion would only be that what was included in the 
lower class is included in the higher and the result 
therefore nothing except that the classification is 
consistent with itself but we have seen that it is no 
sufficient account of the meaning of a proposition to 
say that it refers something to or excludes something 
from a class every proposition which conveys real 
information asserts a matter of fact dependent upon 
the laws of nature and not upon artificial classifica 
tion it asserts that a given object does or does not 
possess a given attribute or it asserts that two attri 
butes or sets of attributes do or do not constantly 
or occasionally coexist since such is the purport of 
all propositions which convey any real knowledge 
and since ratiocination is a mode of acquiring real 
knowledge any theory of ratiocination which does not 
recognize this import of propositions cannot we may 
be sure be the true one 

applying this view of propositions to the two 
premisses of a syllogism we obtain the following 
results the major premiss which as already 
remarked is always universal asserts that all things 
which have a certain attribute or attributes have or 
have not along with it a certain other attribute or 
attributes the minor premiss asserts that the 
thing or set of things which are the subject of that 
premiss have the firstmentioned attribute and the 
conclusion is that they have or that they have not 
the second thus in our former example

s reasoning 

all men are mortal 

socrates is a man 
therefore 

socrates is mortal 
the subject and predicate of the major premiss are 
connotative terms denoting objects and connoting 
attributes the assertion in the major premiss is 
that along with one of the two sets of attributes we 
always find the other that the attributes connoted by 
• man never exist unless conjoined with the attri 
bute called mortality the assertion in the minor 
premiss is that the individual named socrates pos 
sesses the former attributes and it is concluded that 
he possesses also the attribute mortality or if both 
the premisses are general propositions as 

all men are mortal 

all kings are men 
therefore 

all kings are mortal 
the minor premiss asserts that the attributes denoted 
by kingship only exist in conjimction with those 
signified by the word man the major asserts as 
before that the lastmentioned attributes are never 
found without the attribute of mortality the con 
clusion is that wherever the attributes of kingship are 
found that of mortality is found also 

if the major premiss were negative as no men 
are gods it would assert not that the attributes con 
noted by man never exist without but that they 
never exist with those connoted by god from 
which together with the minor premiss it is con 
cluded that the same incompatibility exists between 
the attributes constituting a god and those constituting 
a king in a similar manner we might analyze any 
other example of the syllogism

ratiocination or syllogism 

if we generalize this process and look out for the 
principle or law involved in every such inference and 
presupposed in every syllogism the propositions of 
which are anything more than merely verbal we 
find not the unmeaning dictum de omni et nullo but 
a fundamental principle or rather two principles 
strikingly resembling the axioms of mathematics 
the first which is the principle of affirmative syllo 
gisms is that things which coexist with the same 
thing coexist with one another the second is the 
principle of negative syllogisms and is to this effect 
that a thing which coexists with another thing with 
which other a third thing does not coexist is not coex 
istent with that third thing these axioms mani 
festly relate to facts and not to conventions and one 
or other of them is the ground of the legitimacy of 
every argument in which facts and not conventions 
are the matter treated of 

 it only remains to translate this exposition of 
the syllogism from the one into the other of the two 
languages in which we formerly remarked that all 
propositions and of course therefore all combinations

the second thus regarded every syllogism comes 
within the following general formula — 

attribute a is a mark of attribute b 
a given object has the mark a 

therefore 
the given object has the attribute b 

referred to this type the arguments which we 
have lately cited as specimens of the syllogism will 
express themselves in the following manner — 

the attributes of man are a mark of the attribute 
mortality 
socrates has the attributes of man 

therefore 
socrates has the attribute niortauty 

and again 

the attributes of man are a mark of the attribute 

mortality 
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attri 
butes of man 
therefore 
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attri 
bute mortality 
and lastly 

the attributes of man are a mark of the absence 

of the attributes of a god 
the attributes of a king are a mark of the attri 
butes of man 
therefore 
the attributes of a king are a mark of the absence of 
the attributes signified by the word god 
or are evidence of the absence of those attributes

to correspond with this alteration in the form of 
the syllogisms the axioms on which the syllogistic 
process is founded must undergo a corresponding 
transformation in this altered phraseology both 
those axioms may be brought mder one general 
expression namely that whatever possesses any 
mark possesses that which it is a mark of or 
when the minor premiss as well as the major is 
universal we may state it thus whatever is a mark 
of any mark is a mark of that which this last is a 
mark of to trace the identity of these axioms with 
those previously laid down may be safely left to the 
intelligent reader we shall find as we proceed the 
great convenience of the phraseology into which we 
have last thrown them and which is better adapted 
than any i am acquainted with to express with pre 
cision and force what is aimed at and actually 
accomplished in every case of the ascertainment of a

chapter iii 

of the functions and logical value 
of the syllogism 

§ we have shown what is the real nature of 
the truths with which the syllogism is conversant 
in contradistinction to the more superficial manner 
in which their import is conceived in the common 
theory and what are the fundamental axioms on 
which its probative force or conclusiveness depends 
we have now to inquire whether the syllogistic 
process that of reasoning from generals to particu 
lars is or is not a process of inference a progress 
from the known to the unknown a means of coming 
to a knowledge of something which we did not know 
before 

logicians have been remarkably unanimous in 
their mode of answering this question it is univer 
sally allowed that a syllogism is vicious if there be 
anything more in the conclusion than was assumed in 
the premisses but this is in fact to say that 
nothing ever was or can be proved by syllogism 
which was not known or assumed to be known 
before is ratiocination then not a process of infer 
ence and is the syllogism to which the word 
reasoning has so often been represented to be exclu 
sively appropriate not really entitled to be called 
reasoning at all this seems an inevitable conse 
quence of the doctrine admitted by all writers on the 
subject that a syllogism can prove no more than is 
involved in the premisses yet the acknowledgment

functions and value of the syllogism 

so explicitly made has not prevented one set of 
writers from continuing to represent the syllogism 
as the correct analysis of what the mind actually 
performs in discovering and proving the larger half of 
the truths whether of science or of daily life which 
we believe while those who have avoided this incon 
sistency and followed out the general theorem 
respecting the logical value of the syllogism to its 
legitimate corollary have been led to impute useless 
ness and frivolity to the syllogistic theory itself on 
the ground of the petitio prindpii which they allege 
to be inherent in every syllogism as i beheve both 
these opinions to be fundamentally erroneous i must 
request the attention of the reader to certain consi 
derations without which any just appreciation of the 
true character of the syllogism and the functions it 
performs in philosophy appears to me impossible 
but which seem to have been either overlooked or 
insufficiently adverted to both by the defenders of 
the syllogistic theory and by its assailants 

§ it must be granted that in every syllogism 
considered as an argument to prove the conclusion 
there is a petitio prindpii when we say 

all men are mortal 
socrates is a man 

therefore 
socrates is mortal 

it is unanswerably urged by the adversaries of the 
syllogistic theory that the proposition socrates is 
mortal is presupposed in the more general assump 
tion all men are mortal that we cannot be assured 
of the mortality of all men unless we were previously 
certain of the mortality of every individual man that

 reasoning 

if it be still doubtful whether socrates or any other 
individual you choose to name be mortal or not the 
same degree of uncertainty must hang over the asser 
tion all men are mortal that the general principle 
instead of being given as evidence of the particular 
case cannot itself be taken for true without exception 
until every shadow of doubt which could affect any 
case comprised with it is dispelled by evidence 
aliunde and then what remains for the syllogism to 
prove that in short no reasoning from generals to 
particulars can as such prove anything since from a 
general principle you cannot infer any particulars 
but those which the principle itself assumes as fore 
known 

this doctrine is irrefragable and if logicians 
though unable to dispute it have usually exhibited a 
strong disposition to explain it away this was not 
because they could discover any flaw in the argu 
ment itself but because the contrary opinion seemed 
to rest upon arguments equally indisputable in the 
syllogism last referred to for example or in any of 
those which we previously constructed is it not 
evident that the conclusion may to the person to 
whom the syllogism is presented be actually and bond 
fide a new truth is it not matter of daily experience 
that truths previously undreamt of facts which have 
not been and cannot be directly observed are 
arrived at by way of general reasoning we believe 
that the duke of wellington is mortal we do not 
know this by direct observation since he is not yet 
dead if we were asked how this being the case we 
know the duke to be mortal we should probably 
answer because all men are so here therefore 
we arrive at the knowledge of a truth not as yet 
susceptible of observation by a reasoning which

functions and value op thb syllogism 

admits of being exhibited in the following syllo 
gism — 

all men are mortal 
the duke of wellington is a man 

therefore 
the duke of wellington is mortal 

and since a large portion of our knowledge is thus 
acquired logicians have persisted in representing the 
syllogism as a process of inference or proof although 
none of them has cleared up the difficulty which 
arises from the inconsistency between that assertion 
and the principle that if there be anything in the 
conclusion which was not already asserted in the 
premisses the argument is vicious for it is impos 
sible to attach any serious scientific value to such a 
mere salvo as the distinction drawn between being 
involved by implication in the premisses and being 
directly asserted in them when archbishop whately 
for example says that the object of reasoning is 
 merely to expand and unfold the assertions wrapt up 
as it were and implied in those with which we set 
out and to bring a person to perceive and acknow 
ledge the full force of that which he has admitted 
he does not i think meet the real difficulty requiring 
to be explained namely how it happens that a science 
like geometry can be all wrapt up in a few defi 
nitions and axioms nor does this defence of the 
syllogism difier much from what its assailants urge 
against it as an accusation when they charge it with 
being of no use except to those who seek to press the 
consequences of an admission into which a man has 
been entrapped without having considered and under

stood its full force when you admitted the major 
premiss you asserted the conclusion but says arch 
bishop whately you asserted it by implication merely 
this however can here only mean that you asserted 
it unconsciously that you did not know you were 
asserting it but if so the difficulty revives in this 
shape — ought you not to have known were you 
warranted in asserting the general proposition without 
having satisfied yourself of the truth of everything 
which it fairly includes and if not what then is 
the syllogistic art but a contrivance for catching you 
in a trap and holding you fast in it 

§ from this difficulty there appears to be but 
one issue the proposition that the duke of wel 
lington is mortal is evidently an inference it is got 
at as a conclusion from something else but do we 
in reahty conclude it from the proposition all men 
are mortal i answer no 

the error committed is i conceive that of over 
looking the distinction between the two parts of the 
process of philosophizing the inferring part and the 
registering part and ascribing to the latter the 
functions of the former the mistake is that of 
referring a man to his own notes for the origin of his 
knowledge if a man is asked a question and is at 
the moment unable to answer it he may refresh his 
memory by turning to a memorandum which he car 
ries about with him but if he were asked how the 
fact came to his knowledge he would scarcely answer 
because it was set down in his notebook unless the 
book was written like the koran with a quill from 
the wing of the angel gabriel

from the proposition all men are mortal whence do 
we derive our knowledge of that general truth no 
supernatural aid being supposed the answer must be 
by observation now all which man can observe are 
individual cases from these all general truths must 
be drawn and into these they may be again resolved 
for a general truth is but an aggregate of particular 
truths a comprehensive expression by which an 
indefinite number of individual facts are affirmed or 
denied at once but a general proposition is not 
merely a compendious form for recording and pre 
serving in the memory a number of particular facts 
all of which have been observed generalisation is 
not a process of mere naming it is also a process of 
inference from instances which we have observed 
we feel warranted in concluding that what we found 
true in those instances holds in all similar ones past 
present and future however numerous they may be 
we then by that valuable contrivance of language 
which enables us to speak of many as if they were 
one record all that we have observed together with 
all that we infer from our observations in one concise 
expression and have thus only one proposition 
instead of an endless number to remember or to 
communicate the results of many observations and 
inferences and instructions for making innumerable 
inferences in imforeseen cases are compressed into 
one short sentence 

when therefore we conclude from the death of 
john and thomas and every other person we ever 
heard of in whose case the experiment had been 
fairly tried that the duke of wellington is mortal 
like the rest we may indeed pass through the 
generalisation all men are mortal as an inter 
mediate stage but it is not in the latter half of the

wellington that the inference resides the inference 
is finished when we have asserted that all mi are 
mortal what remains to be performed afterwards is 
merely deciphering our own notes 

archbishop whately has contended that syllo 
gising or reasoning from generals to particulars is 
not agreeably to the vulgar idea a peculiar mode of 
reasoning but the philosophical analysis of the mode 
in which all men reason and must do so if they 
reason at all with the deference due to so high an 
authority i cannot help thinking that the vulgar 
notion is in this case the more correct if from our 
experience of john thomas c who once were 
living but are now dead we are entitled to conclude 
that all hiunan beings are mortal we might surely 
without any logical inconsequence have concluded 
at once from those instances that the duke of wel 
lington is mortal the mortality of john thomas 
and company is after all the whole evidence we have 
for the mortality of the duke of wellington not 
one iota is added to the proof by interpolating a 
general proposition since the individual cases are 
all the evidence we can possess evidence which no 
logical form into which we choose to throw it can 
make greater than it is and since that evidence is 
either sufficient in itself or if insufficient for one pur 
pose cannot be sufficient for the other i am unable 
to see why we should be forbidden to take the 
shortest cut from these sufficient premisses to the 
conclusion and constrained to travel the high priori 
road by the arbitrary fiat of logicians i cannot 
perceive why it should be impossible to journey from 
one place to another unless we march up a hill and 
then march down again it may be the safest road

country but for the mere purpose of arriving at

optional it is a question of time trouble and 
danger 

not only may we reason from particulars to par 
ticulars without passing through generals but we 
perpetually do so reason all our earliest inferences 
are of this nature from the first dawn of intelligence 
we draw inferences but years elapse before we learn 
the use of general language the child who having 
burnt his fingers avoids to thrust them again into the 
fire has reasoned or inferred though he has never 
thought of the general maxim fire bums he knows 
from memory that he has been burnt and on this 
evidence believes when he sees a candle that if he 
puts his finger into the flame of it he will be burnt 
again he believes this in every case which happens 
to arise but without looking in each instance beyond 
the present case he is not generalizing he is infer 
ring a particular from particulars in the same way 
also brutes reason there is uttle or no ground for 
attributing to any of the lower animals the use of con 
ventional signs without which general propositions 
are impossible but those animals profit by experi 
ence and avoid what they have found to cause them 
pain in the same manner though not always with the 
same skill as a human creature not only thiburnt 
child but the burnt dog dreads the fire

from ourselves to other people or from one person to 
another without giving ourselves the trouble to erect 
our observations into general maxims of human or 
external nature when we conclude that some person 
will on some given occasion feel or act so and so 
we sometimes judge from an enlarged consideration of 
the manner in which men in general or men of some 
particular character are accustomed to feel and act 
but much oftener from having known the fieelings and 
conduct of the same man in some previous instance 
or from considering how we should feel or act our

no definite maxims to steer by guide ourselves in the

justifying or of communicating to others among

even philosophers who possess in the form of 
general propositions a systematic record of the results 
of the experience of mankind need not always revert 
to those general propositions in order to apply that 
experience to a new casa it is justly remarked by 
dugald stewart that though our reasonings in mathe 
matics depend entirely upon the axioms it is by no 
means necessary to our seeing the conclusiveness of 
the proof that the axioms should be expressly adverted 
to when it is inferred that a b is equal to c d 
because each of them is equal to e f the most uncul 
tivated understanding as soon as the propositions 
were understood would assent to the inference with 
out having ever heard of the general truth that 
 things which are equal to the same thing are equal 
to one another this remark of stewart consistently 
followed out goes to the root as i conceive of the 
philosophy of ratiocination and it is to be regretted 
that he tdmself stopt short at a much more limited 
application of it he saw that the general proposi 
tions on which a reasoning is said to depend may in 
certain cases be altogether omitted without impairing 
its probative force but he imagined this to be a 
peculiarity belonging to axioms and argued from it 
that axioms are not the foundations or first principles 
of geometry from which au the other truths of the 
science are synthetically deduced as the laws of 
motion and of the composition of forces in mechanics

which as premisses nothing can be demonstrated in 
the present as in many other instances this thoughtful 
and elegant writer has perceived an important truth 
but only by halves finding in the case of geometrical 
axioms that general names have not any talismanic 
virtue for conjuring new truths out of the pit of 
darkness and not seeing that this is equally true in 
every other case of generalization he contended that 
axioms are in their nature barren of consequences and 
that the really fruitful truths the real first principles 
of geometry are the definitions that the definition 
for example of the circle is to the properties of the 
circle what the laws of equilibrium and of the pressure 
of the atmosphere are to the rise of the mercury in 
the torricellian tube yet all that he had asserted 
respecting the function to which the axioms are con 
fined in the demonstrations of geometry holds equally 
true of the definitions every demonstration in 
euclid might be carried on without them this is 
apparent from the ordinary process of proving a pro 
position of geometry by means of a diagram what 
assumption in fact do we set out from to demonstrate 
by a diagram any of the properties of the circle 
not that in all circles the radii are equal but only 
that they are so in the circle abc as our warrant 
for assuming this we appeal it is true to the defini

accorded with our assumptions the enunciation as 
it is called that is the general theorem which stands 
at the head of the demonstration is not the propo 
sition actually demonstrated one instance only is 
demonstrated but the process by which this is done 
is a process which when we consider its nature we 
perceive might be exactly copied in an indefinite 
number of other instances in every instance which 
conforms to certain conditions the contrivance of 
general language furnishing us with terms which con 
note these conditions we are able to assert this 
indefinite multitude of truths in a single expression 
and this expression is the general theorem by 
dropping the use of diagrams and substituting in the 
demonstrations general phrases for the letters of the 
alphabet we might prove the general theorem directly 
that is we might demonstrate all the cases at once 
and to do this we must of course employ as our 
premisses the axioms and definitions in their general 
form but this only means that if we can prove an 
individual conclusion by assuming an individual fact 
then in whatever case we are warranted in making an 
exactly similar assumption we may draw an exactly 
similar conclusion the definition is a sort of notice 
to ourselves and others what assumptions we think 
ourselves entitled to make and so in all cases the 
general propositions whether called definitions

may proceed upon as proved or intend to assume 
in any one demonstration it is enough if we assume 
for a particular case suitably selected what by the 
statement of the definition or principle we announce 
that we intend to assume in all cases which may arise 
the definition of the circle therefore is to one of 
euclids demonstrations exactly what according to 
stewart the axioms are that is the demonstration 
does not depend upon it but yet if we deny it the 
demonstration fails the proof does not rest upon 
the general assumption but upon a similar assump 
tion confined to the particular case that case how 
ever being chosen as a specimen or paradigm of the 
whole class of cases included in the theorem there 
can be no ground for making the assumption in that 
case which does not exist in every other and if you 
deny the assumption as a general truth you deny the 
right to make it in the particular instance 

there are undoubtedly the most ample reasons 
for stating both the principles and the theorems in 
their general form and these will be explained pre 
sently so far as explanation is requisite but that 
an unpractised learner even in making use of one 
theorem to demonstrate another reasons rather from 
particular to particular than from the general propo 
sition is manifest from the difficulty he finds in 
applying a theorem to a case in which the configura 
tion of the diagram is extremely unlike that of the 
diagram by which the original theorem was demon 
strated a difficulty which except in cases of unusual 
mental power long practice can alone remove and 
removes chiefly by rendering us familiar with all the

§ from the considerations now adduced the 
following conclusions seem to be established all 
inference is from particulars to particulars general 
propositions are merely registers of such inferences 
already made and short formulae for making more 
the major premiss of a syllogism consequently is a 
formula of this description and the conclusion is not 
an inference drawn rom the formula but an inference 
drawn according to the formula the real logical 
antecedent or premisses being the particular facts 
fitm which the general proposition was collected by 
induction those facts and the individual instances 
which supplied them may have been forgotten but 
a record remains not indeed descriptive of the facts 
themselves but showing how those cases may be 
distinguished respecting which the facts when 
known were considered to warrant a given inference 
according to the indications of this record we draw 
our conclusion which is to all intents and purposes 
a conclusion from the forgotten facts for this it is 
essential that we should read the record correctly 
and the rules of the syllcm are a set of precautions 
to ensure our doing so 

this view of the functions of the syllogism is 
confirmed by the consideration of precisely those 
cases which might be expected to be least favourable 
to it namely those in which ratiocination is inde 
pendent of any previous induction we have already 
observed that the syllogism in the ordinary course of 
our reasoning is only the latter half of the process 
of travelling from premisses to a conclusion there

of a certain description be conceived as coming to us 
from other sources than observation it may present 
itself as coming from revelation and the knowledge 
thus supematurally communicated may be conceived 
to comprise not only particular facts but general 
propositions such as occur so abundantly in the 
writings of solomon and in the apostolic epistles or 
the generalization may not be in the ordinary sense 
an assertion at all but a command a law not in the 
philosophical but in the moral and political sense of 
the term an expression of the desire of a superior 
that we or any number of other persons shall con 
form our conduct to certain general instructions so 
far as this asserts a fact namely a volition of the 
legislator that fact is an individusj fact and the pro 
position therefore is not a general proposition but 
the description therein contained of the conduct 
which it is the will of the legislator that his subjects 
should observe is general the proposition asserts 
not that all men are anything but that au men shall 
do something these two cases of a truth revealed 
in general terms and a command intimated in the 
like manner might be exchanged for the more 
extensive cases of any general statement received 
upon testimony and any general practical precept 
but the more limited illustrations suit us better being 
drawn from subjects where long and complicated 
trains of ratiocination have actually been groimded 
upon premisses which came to manldnd from the first 
in a general form the subjects of scriptural theology 
and of positive law

legislator intended his command to apply to the pre 
sent case among others or not this is a question 
as the germans express it of hermeneutics it relates 
to the meaning of a certain form of discourse the 
operation is not a process of inference but a process 
of interpretation 

in this last phrase we have obtained an expression 
which appears to me to characterize more aptly than 
any other the functions of the syllogism in all cases 
when the premisses are given by authority the 
function of reasoning is to ascertain the testimony of 
a witness or the will of a legislator by interpreting 
the signs in which the one has intimated his assertion 
and the other his command in like manner when 
the premisses are derived from observation the func 
tion of reasoning is to ascertain what we or our 
predecessors formerly thought might be inferred from 
the observed facts and to do this by interpreting a 
memorandum of ours or of theirs the memorandum 
reminds us that from evidence more or less carefully 
weighed it formerly appeared that a certain attribute 
might be inferred wherever we perceive a certain 
mark the proposition all men are mortal for 
instance shows that we have had experience from 
which we thought it followed that the attributes 
connoted by the term man are a mark of mortality 
but when we conclude that the duke of wellington 
is mortal we do not infer this from the memorandum

 reasoning 

but from the former experience all that we infer 
from the memorandum is our own previous belief 
or that of those who transmitted to us the propo 
sition concerning the inferences which that former 
experience would warrant 

this view of the nature of the syllogism renders 
consistent and intelligible what otherwise remains 
obscure and confused in the theory of archbishop 
whately and other enlightened defenders of the syllo 
gistic doctrine respecting the limits to which its 
functions are confined they all affirm in as explicit 
terms as can be used that the sole office of general 
reasoning is to prevent inconsistency in our opinions 
to prevent us from assenting to anything the truth of 
which would contradict something to which we had 
previously on good grounds given our assent and 
they tell us that the sole ground which a syllogism 
afibrds for assenting to the conclusion is that the 
supposition of its being false combined with the 
supposition that the premisses are true would lead to 
a contradiction in terms now this would be but a 
lame account of the real grounds which we have for 
believing the facts which we learn from reasoning in 
contradistinction to observation the true reason 
why we believe that the duke of wellington will die 
is that his fathers and our fathers and all other 
persons who were contemporary with them have died 
those facts are the real premisses of the reasoning 
but we are not led to infer the conclusion from those 
premisses by the necessity of avoiding any verbal 
inconsistency there is no contradiction in supposing 
that all those persons have died and that the duke 
of wellington may notwithstanding live for ever 
but there would be a contradiction if we first on the 
ground of those same premisses made a general 

digitized by vjooq ic 



functions and value of the syllogism 

assertion including and covering the case of the duke 
of wellington and then refused to stand to it in the 
individual case there is an inconsistency to be 
avoided between the memorandum we make of the 
inferences which may be justly drawn in future cases 
and the inferences we actually draw in those cases 
when they arise with this view we interpret our 
own formula precisely as a judge interprets a law in 
order that we may avoid drawing any inferences not 
conformable to our former intention as a judge avoids 
giving any decision not conformable to the legislators 
intention the rules for this interpretation are the 
rules of the syllogism and its sole purpose is to 
maintain consistency between the conclusions we draw 
in every particular case and the previous general 
directions for drawing them whether those general 
directions were framed by ourselves as the result of 
induction or were received by us from an authority 
competent to give them 

 in the above observations it has i think 
been clearly shown that although there is always a 
process of reasoning or inference where a syllogism is 
used the syllogism is not a correct analysis of that 
process of reasoning or inference which is on the 
contrary when not a mere inference from testimony 
an inference from particulars to particulars autho 
rised by a previous inference from particulars to 
generals and substantially the same with it of the 
nature therefore of induction but while these 
conclusions appear to me undeniable i must yet enter 
a protest as strong as that of archbishop whately 
himself against the doctrine that the syllogistic art is 
useless for the purposes of reasoning the reasoning 
lies in the act of generalisation not in interpreting the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

record of that act but the syllogistic form is an 
indispensable collateral security for the correctness of 
the generalisation itself 

it has already been seen that if we have a collec 
tion of particulars sufficient for grounding an induc 
tion we need not frame a general proposition we 
may reason at once from those particulars to other 
particulars but it is to be remarked withal that 
whenever from a set of particular cases we can 
legitimately draw any inference we may legitimately 
make our inference a general one if from observa 
tion and experiment we can conclude to one new 
case so may we to an indefinite number if that 
which has held true in our past experience will 
therefore hold in time to come it will hold not 
merely in some individual case but in all cases of a 
given description every induction therefore which 
suffices to prove one fact proves an indefinite multi 
tude of facts the experience which justifies a single 
prediction must be such as will suffice to bear out a 
general theorem this theorem it is extremely 
important to ascertain and declare in its broadest 
form of generality and thus to place before our 
minds in its full extent the whole of what our 
evidence must prove if it proves anything 

this throwing of the whole body of possible 
inferences from a given set of particulars into one 
general expression operates as a security for their 
being just inferences in more ways than one first 
the general principle presents a larger object to the 
imagination than any of the singular propositions 
which it contains a process of thought which leads 
to a comprehensive generality is felt as of greater 
importance than one which terminates in an insulated 
fact and the mind is even unconsciously led to

functions and value of thb syllogism 

bestow greater attention upon the process and to 
weigh more carefully the sufficiency of the experience 
appealed to for supporting the inference grounded 
upon it there is another and a more important 
advantage in reasoning from a course of individual 
observations to some new and unobserved case which 
we are but imperfectly acquainted with or we should 
not be inquiring into it and in which since we are 
inquiring into it we probably feel a peculiar interest 
there is very little to prevent us from giving way to 
negligence or to any bias which may affect our wishes 
or our imagination and under that influence accept 
ing insufficient evidence as sufficient but if instead 
of concluding straight to the particular case we place 
before ourselves an entire class of facts — the whole 
contents of a general proposition every tittle of 
which is legitimately inferrible from our premisses if 
that one particular conclusion is so there is then a 
considerable likelihood that if the premisses are insuf 
ficient and the general inference therefore ground 
less it will comprise within it some fact or facts the • 
reverse of which we already know to be true and we 
shall thus discover the error in our generalisation by 
what the schoolmen termed a reductio ad impossibile 

thus if during the reign of marcus aurelius a 
subject of the roman empire under the bias natu 
rally given to the imagination and expectations by 
the lives and characters of the antonines had been 
disposed to conclude that commodus would be a just 
ruler supposing him to stop there he might only 
have been undeceived by sad experience but if he 
reflected that this conclusion could not be justifiable 
unless from the same evidence he was also warranted 
in concluding some general proposition as for 
instance that all roman emperors are just rulers he 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

would immediately have thought of nero domitiao 
and other instances which showing the falsity of the 
general conclusion and therefore the insufficiency 
of the premisses would have warned him that those 
premisses could not prove in the instance of com 
modus what they were inadequate to prove in any 
collection of cases in which his was included 

the advantage in judging whether any contro 
verted inference is legitimate of referring to a parallel 
case is universally acknowledged but by ascending 
to the general proposition we bring imder our view 
not one parallel case only but all possible forallel 
cases at once all cases to which the same set of 
evidentiary considerations are applicable 

when therefore we argue from a number of 
known cases to another case supposed to be analo 
gous it is always possible and generally advanta 
geous to divert our argument into the circuitous 
channel of an induction from those known cases to a 
genertd proposition and a subsequent application of 
that general propoeition to the imknown case this 
second part of the operatimi which as before 
observed is essentially a process of interpretation 
will be resolvable into a syllogism or a series of 
syllogisms the majors of which will be general pro 
positions embracing whole classes of cases every one 
of which propositions must be true in all its extent 
if our argument is maintainable if therefore any 
fact fairly coming within the range of one of these 
general propositions and consequently asserted by it 
is known or suspected to be other than the propo 
sition asserts it to be this mode of stating the argu 
ment causes us to know or to suspect that the 
original observations which are the real grounds of 
our conclusion are not sufficient to support it and

functions and value of the syllogism 

in proportion to the greater chance of our detecting 
the inconclusiveness of our evidence will be the 
increased reliance we are entitled to place in it if no 
such evidence of defect shall appear 

the value therefore of the syllogistic form and i 
of ibe rules for using it correctly does not consist in 
their being the form and the rules according to which 
our reasonings are necessarily or even usually made 
but in their furnishing us with a mode in which those 
reasonings may always be represented and which is 
admirably calculated if they are inconclusive to 
bring their inconclusiveness to light an induction 
from particulars to generals followed by a syllogistic 
process from those generals to other particuhuns is a 
form in which we may always state our reasonings if 
we please it is not a form in which we must reason 
but it is a form in which we may reason and into 
which it is indispensable to throw our reasoning when 
there is any doubt of its validity though when the 
case is familiar and little complicated and there is no 
suspicion of error we may and do reason at once 
from the known particular cases to unknown ones 

these are the uses of the syllogism as a mode of 
verifying any given argument its ulterior uses as 
respects the general course of our intellectual opera 
tions hardly require illustration being in fact the 
acknowledged uses of general language they amount 
substantially to this that the inductions may be made 
once for all a single careful interrogation of expe 
rience may suffice and the result may be registered in 
the form of a general proposition which is committed 
to memory or to writing and from which afterwards 
we have only to syllogize the particulars of our 
experiments may then be dismissed from the memory 
in which it would be impossible to retain so great

 reasoning 

a multitude of details while the knowledge which 
those details afforded for future use and which would 
otherwise be lost as soon as the observations were 
forgotten or as their record became too bulky for 
reference is retained in a commodious and imme 
diately available shape by means of general language 

against this advantage is to be set the coimter 
vailing inconvenience that inferences originally made 
on insufficient evidence become consecrated and as it 
were hardened into general maxuns and the mind 
cleaves to them from habit after it has outgrown 
any liability to be misled by similar fallacious appear 
ances if they were now for the first time presented 
but having forgotten the particulars it does not think 
of revising its own former decision an inevitable 
drawback which however considerable in itself forms 
evidently but a trifling deduction from the immense 
advantages of general language 

the use of the syllogism is in truth no other than 
the use of general propositions in reasoning we 
can reason without them in simple and obvious cases 
we habitually do so minds of great sagacity can do it 
in cases not simple and obvious provided their expe 
rience supplies them with instances essentially similar 
to every combination of circumstances likely to arise 
but other men or the same men when without the 
same preeminent advantages of personal experience 
are quite helpless without the aid of general proposi 
tions wherever the case presents the smallest compli 
cation and if we made no general propositions few 
of us would get much beyond those simple inferences 
which are drawn by the more intelligent of the brutes 
though not necessary to reasoning general propositions 
are necessary to any considerable progress in reasoning 
it is therefore natural and indispensable to separate the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



functions and value of the syllogism 

process of investigation into two parts and obtain 
general formulae for determining what inferences may 
be drawn before the occasion arises for drawing the 
inferences the work of drawing them is then that 
of applying the formulae and the rules of the syllo 
gism are a system of securities for the correctness of 
the application 

 to complete the series of considerations con 
nected with the philosophical character of the syllo 
gism it is requisite to consider since the syllogism is 
not the universal type of the reasoning process what 
is the real type this resolves itself into the ques 
tion what is the nature of the minor premiss and in 
what manner it contributes to establish the conclu 
sion for as to the major we now fully understand 
that the place which it nominally occupies in our 
reasonings properly belongs to the individual facts or 
observations of which it expresses the general result 
the major itself being no real part of the argument 
but an intermediate halting place for the mind inter 
posed by an artifice of language between the real 
premisses and the conclusion by way of a security 
which it is in a most material degree for the correct 
ness of the process the minor however being an 
indispensable part of the syllogistic expression of an 
argument without doubt either is or corresponds to 
an equally indispensable part of the argument itself 
and we have only to inquire what part 

it is perhaps worth while to notice here a specu 
lation of one of the philosophers to whom mental 
science is most indebted but who though a very 
penetrating was a very hasty thinker and whose 
want of due circumspection rendered him fully as 
remarkable for what he did not see as for what he saw 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

i allude to dr thomas brown whose theory of ratioci 
nation is peculiar he saw the petitio principii which 
is inherent in every syllogism if we consider the 
major to be itself the evidence by which the conclusion 
is proved instead of being what in fact it is an 
assertion of vthe existence of evidence sufficient to 
prove any conclusion of a given description seeing 
this dr brown not only failed to see the immense 
advantage in point of security for correctness which 
is gained by interposing this step between the real 
evidence and the conclusion but he thought it 
incumbent upon him to strike out the major alto 
gether from the reasoning process without substituting 
anything else and maintained that our reasonings 
consist only of the minor premiss and the conclusion 
socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal thus 
actually suppressing as an unnecessary step in the 
argument the appeal to former experience the 
absurdity of this was disguised from him by the 
opinion he adopted that reasoning is merely analyzing 
our own general notions or abstract ideas and that 
the proposition socrates is mortal is evolved from 
the proposition socrates is a man simply by recog 
nising the notion of mortality as already contained in 
the notion we form of a man 

after the explanations so fully entered into on the 
subject of propositions much further discussion cannot 
be necessary to make the radical error of this view of 
ratiocination apparent if the word man connoted 
mortality if the meaning of mortal were involved 
in the meaning of man we might undoubtedly 
evolve the conclusion from the minor alone because 
the minor would have distinctly asserted it but if 
as is in fact the case the word man does not connote 
mortality how does it appear that in the mind of 



digitized

functions andvalue of the syllogism 

every person who admits socrates to be a man the 
idea of man must include the idea of mortality dr 
brown could not help seeing this difficulty and in 
order to avoid it was led contrary to his intention 
to reestablish under another name that step in the 
argument which corresponds to the major by affirming 
the necessity of previously perceiving the relation 
between the idea of man and the idea of mortal if 
the reasoner has not previously perceived this rela 
tion he will not says dr brown infer because 
socrates is a man that socrates is mortal but even 
this admission though amounting to a surrender of 
the doctrine that an argument consists of the minor 
and the conclusion alone will not save the remainder 
of dr browns theory the failure of assent to the 
argument does not take place merely because the 
reasoner for want of due analysis does not perceive 
that his idea of man includes the idea of mortality it 
takes place much more commonly because in his 
mind that relation between the two ideas has never 
existed and in truth it never does exist except as 
the result of experience consenting for the sake of 
the argument to discuss the question upon a suppo 
sition of which we have recognised the radical incor 
rectness namely that the meaning of a proposition 
relates to the ideas of the things spoken of and not 
to the things themselves and conceding for a mo 
ment the existence of abstract ideas i must yet 
observe that the idea of man as an universal idea 
the common property of all rational creatures cannot 
involve anything but what is strictly implied in the 
name if any one includes in his own private idea of 
man as no doubt is almost always the case some 
other attributes such for instance as mortality he 
does so only as the consequence of experience after 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

having satisfied himself that all men possess that 
attribute so that whatever the idea contains in any 
persons mind beyond what is included in the con 
ventional signification of the word has been added to 
it as the result of assent to a proposition while dr 
browns theory requires us to suppose on the con 
trary that assent to the proposition is produced by 
evolving through an analytic process this very ele 
ment out of the idea this theory therefore may 
be considered as sufficiently refuted and the minor 
premiss must be regarded as totally insufficient to 
prove the conclusion except with the assistance of 
the major or of that which the major represents 
namely the various singular propositions expressive 
of the series of observations of which the generaliza 
tion called the major premiss is the result 

in the argument then which proves that so 
crates is mortal one indispensable part of the premisses 
will be as follows my father and my fathers 
father a b c and an indefinite number of other 
persons were mortal which is only an expression 
in different words of the observed fact that they have 
died this is the major premiss divested of the 
petitio principiiy and cut down to as much as is really 
known by direct evidence 

in order to connect this proposition with the con 
clusion socrates is mortal the additional link neces 
sary is such a proposition as the following socrates 
resembles my father and my fathers father and the 
other individuals specified this proposition we 
assert when we say that socrates is a man by 
saying so we likewise assert in what respect he 
resembles them namely in the attributes connoted by 
the word man and from this we conclude that he 
further resembles them in the attribute mortality

§ we have thus obtained what we were seeking 
an universal type of the reasoning process we find 
it resolvable in all cases into the following elements 
certain individuals have a given attribute an indi 
vidual or individuals resemble the former in certain 
other attributes therefore they resemble them also in 
the given attribute itiis type of ratiocination does 
not claim like the syllogism to be conclusive from the t 
mere form of the expression nor can it possibly be 
so that one proposition does or does not assert the 
very fact which was already asserted in another may 
appear from the form of the expression that is from 
a comparison of the language but when the two 
propositions assert facts which are bond fide difierent 
whether the one fact proves the other or not can never 
appear from the language but must depend upon 
other considerations whether from the attributes in 
which socrates resembles those men who have hereto 
fore died it is allowable to infer that he resembles 
them also in being mortal is a question of induction 
and is to be decided by the principles or canons which 
we shall hereafter recognise as tests of the correct 
performance of that great mental operation 

meanwhile however it is certain as before re 
marked that if this inference can be drawn as to 
socrates it can be drawn as to all others who 
resemble the observed individuals in the same attri 
butes in which he resembles them that is to express 
the thing concisely of all men if therefore the 
argument be conclusive in the case of socrates we 
are at liberty once for au to treat the possession of 
the attributes of man as a mark or satisfactory evi 
dence of the attribute of mortality this we do by 
laying down the universal proposition all men are 
mortal and interpreting this as occasion arises in 

vol i t

 reasoning 

its application to socrates and others by this means 
we establish a very convenient division of the entire 
logical operation into two steps first that of ascer 
taining what attributes are marks of mortality and 
secondly whether any given individuals possess those 
marks and it will generally be advisable in our 
speculations on the reasoning process to consider 
this double operation as in fact taking place and all 
reasoning as carried on in the form into which it must 
necessarily be thrown to enable us to apply to it any 
test of its correct performance 

although therefore all processes of thought in 
which the ultimate premisses are particulars whether 
we conclude from particulars to a general formula or 
from particulars to other particulars according to 
that formula are equally induction we shall yet 
conformably to usage consider the name induction as 
more peculiarly belonging to the process of establish 
ing the general proposition and the remaining opera 
tion which is substantially that of interpreting the 
general proposition we shall call by its usual name 
deduction and we shall consider every process by 
which anything is inferred respecting an unobserved 
case as consisting of an induction followed by a 
deduction because although the process needs not 
necessarily be carried on in this form it is always 
susceptible of the form and must be thrown into it 
when assurance of scientific accuracy is needed and

chapter iv 

op trains of reasoning and deductive 
sciences 

 in our analysis of the syllogism it appeared 
that the minor premiss always affirms a resemblance 
between a new case and some cases previously known 
while the major premiss asserts something which 
having been found true of those known cases we con 
sider ourselves warranted in holding true of any other 
case resembling the former in certain given parti 
culars 

if all ratiocinations resembled as to the minor 
premiss the examples which we exclusively employed 
in the preceding chapter if the resemblance which 
that premiss asserts were obvious to the senses as 
in the proposition socrates is a man or were at 
once ascertainable by direct observation there would 
be no necessity for trains of reasoning and deductive 
or ratiocinative sciences would not exist trains of 
reasoning exist only for the sake of extending an 
induction founded as all inductions must be upon 
observed cases to other cases in which we not only 
cannot directly observe what is to be proved but 
cannot directly observe even the mark which is to 
prove it 

§ suppose the syllogism to be all cows rumi 
nate the animal which is before me is a cow there

obviously so the only premiss the establishment of 
which requires any anterior process of inquiry is the

major and provided the induction of which that 
premiss is the expression was correctly performed 
the conclusion respecting the animal now present 
will be instantly drawn because as soon as she is 
compared with the formula she will be identified as 
being included in it but suppose the syllogism to 
be the following — au arsenic is poisonous the sub 
stance which is before me is arsenic therefore it is 
poisonous the truth of the minor may not here be 
obvious at first sight it may not be intuitively evi 
dent but may itself be known only by inference it 
may be the conclusion of another argument which 
thrown into the syllogistic form would stand thus — 
whatever forms a compound with hydrogen which 
yields a black precipitate with nitrate of silver is 
arsenic the substance before me conforms to this 
condition therefore it is arsenic to establish 
therefore the ultimate conclusion the substance 
before me is poisonous requires a process which in 
order to be syllogistically expressed stands in need 
of two syllogisms and we have a train of reasoning 
when however we thus add syllogism to syllo 
gism we are really adding induction to induction 
two separate inductions must have taken place to 
render this chain of inference possible inductions 
founded probably on diflferent sets of individual 
instances but which converge in their results so that 
the instance which is the subject of inquiry comes 
within the range of them both the record of these 
inductions is contained in the majors of the two syllo 
gisms first we or others before us have examined 
various objects which yielded under the given circum 
stances the given precipitate and found that they 
possessed the properties connoted by the word arsenic 
they were metallic volatile their vapour had a smell

trains of reasoning 

of garlic and so forth next we or others before 
us have examined various specimens which possessed 
this metallic and volatile character whose vapour had 
this smell c and have invariably found that they 
were poisonous the first observation we judge that 
we may extend to all substances whatever which 
yield the precipitate the second to all metallic and 
volatile substances resembling those we examined 
and consequently not to those only which are seen to 
be such but to those which are concluded to be such 
by the prior induction the substance before us is 
only seen to come within one of these inductions but 
by means of this one it is brought within the other 
we are still as before concluding from particulars to 
particulars but we are now concluding from parti 
culars observed to other particulars which are not 
as in the simple case seen to resemble them in the 
material points but inferred to do so because resem 
bling them in something else which we have been led 
by quite a different set of instances to consider as a 
mark of the former resemblance 

this first example of a train of reasoning is still 
extremely simple the series consisting of only two 
syllogisms the following is somewhat more com 
plicated — no government which earnestly seeks the 
good of its subjects is liable to revolution the 
prussian government earnestly seeks the good of its 
subjects therefore it is not in danger of revolution 
the major premiss in this argument we shall suppose 
not to be derived from considerations d priori but to 
be a generalisation from history which whether 
correct or erroneous must have been founded upon 
observation of governments concerning whose desire 
of the good of their subjects there was no doubt it 
has been found or thought to be found that these 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

were not liable to revolution and it has been deemed 
that those instances warranted an extension of the 
same predicate to any and every government which 
resembles them in the attribute of desiring earnestly 
the good of its subjects but does the prussian 
government thus resemble them this may be 
debated pro and con by many arguments and must 
in any case be proved by another induction for we 
cannot directly observe the sentiments and desires of 
the persons who conduct the government of that 
country to prove the minor therefore we require 
an argument in this form everj government which 
acts in a certain manner desires the good of its 
subjects the prussian government acts in that par 
ticular manner therefore it desires the good of its 
subjects but is it true that the prussian government 
acts in the manner supposed this minor also may 
require proof still another induction as thus — 
what is asserted by many disinterested witnesses 
must be believed to be true that the prussian 
government acts in this manner is asserted by many 
disinterested witnesses therefore it must be believed 
to be true the argument hence consists of three 
steps having the evidence of our senses that the 
case of the prussian government resembles a number 
of former cases in the circumstance of having some 
thing asserted respecting it by many disinterested 
witnesses we infer first that as in those former 
instances so in this instance the assertion is true 
secondly what was asserted of the prussian govern 
ment being that it acts in a particular manner and 
other governments or persons having been observed 
to act in the same manner the prussian government 
is brought into known resemblance with those other 
governments or persons and since they were known 

digitized by vjooq ic 



trains of reasoning 

to desire the good of the people we thereupon by a 
second induction infer that the prussian government 
desires the good of the people this brings that 
government into known resemblance with the other 
governments which were observed to escape revo 
lution and thence by a third induction we predict 
that the prussian government will in like maimer 
escape and thus we are enabled to reason from the 
wellintentioned governments which we historically 
know as having escaped revolution to other govern 
ments which when we made the induction we may 
have known nothing about yet if the induction was 
good and therefore applicable to all governments of 
which we know the intentions but do not know the 
fortunes it must be no less applicable to those whose 
intentions we do not know but can only infer pro 
vided this inference also rests upon a good induction 
we are still reasoning from particulars to particulars 
but we now reason to the new instance from three 
distinct sets of former instances to one only of those 
sets of instances do we directly perceive the new one 
to be similar but from that similarity we inductively 
infer that it has the attribute by which it is assimilated 
to the next set and brought within the corresponding 
induction when by a repetition of the same operation 
we infer it to be similar to the third set and hence a 
third induction conducts us to the ultimate conclusion 

§ notwithstanding the superior complication 
of these examples compared with those by which in 
the preceding chapter we illustrated the general theory 
of reasoning every doctrine which we then laid down 
holds equally true in these more intricate cases the 
successive general propositions are not steps in the

inference between the particulars observed and those 
to which we apply the observation if we had suffi 
ciently capacious memories and a sufficient power of 
maintainmg order among a huge mass of details the 
reasoning could go on without any general propositions 
they are mere formulae for inferring particulars from 
particulars the principle of general reasoning is as 
before explained that if from observation of certain 
known particulars what was seen to be true of them 
can be inferred to be true of any others it may be 
inferred of all others which are of a certain descrip 
tion and in order that we may never fail to draw 
this conclusion in a new case when it can be drawn 
correctly and may avoid drawing it when it cannot 
we determine once for all what are the distinguisludg 
marks by which such cases may be recognised the 
subsequent process is merely that of identifying an 
object and ascertaining it to have those marks 
whether we identify it by the very marks themselves 
or by others which we have ascertained through 
another and a similar process to be marks of those 
marks the real inference is always from particulars 
to particulars from the observed instances to an 
unobserved one but in drawing this inference we 
conform to a formula which we have adopted for our 
guidance in such operations and which is a record of 
the criteria by which we thought we had ascertained 
that we might distinguish when the inference could 
and when it could not be drawn the real premisses 
are the individual observations even though they may 
have been forgotten or being the observations of 
others and not of ourselves may to us never have 
been known but we have before us proof that we or 
others once thought them sufficient for an induction 
and we have marks to show whether any new case is

one of those to which if then known the induction 
would have been deemed to extend these marks 
we either recognise at once or by the aid of other 
marks which by another previous induction we col 
lected to be marks of them even these marks of 
marks may only be recognised through a third set 
of marks and we may have a train of reasoning 
of any length to bring a new case within the 
scope of an induction grounded on particulars its 
similarity to which is only ascertained in this indirect 
manner 

thus in the argument concerning the prussian 
government the ultimate inductive inference was 
that it was not liable to revolution this inference was 
drawn according to a formula in which desire of the 
public good was set down as a mark of not being 
liable to revolution a mark of this mark was acting 
in a particular manner and a mark of acting in that 
manner was being asserted to do so by many disin 
terested witnesses this mark the prussian govern 
ment was recognised by the senses as possessing 
hence that government fell within the last induction 
and by it was brought within all the others the 
perceived resemblance of the case to one set of 
observed particular cases brought it into known 
resemblance with another set and that with a third

iid that surface parabolic rd those rays parallel to 
each other and to the axis of the surface it is to be 
proved that the concourse of these three circumstances 
is a mark that the reflected rays will pass through the 
focus of the parabolic surface now each of the 
three circumstances is singly a mark of something 
material to the case rays of light impinging on a 
reflecting surface are a mark that those rays will be 
reflected at an angle equal to the angle of incidence 
the parabolic form of the surface is a mark that from 
any point of it a line drawn to the focus and a line 
parallel to the axis will make equal angles with the 
surface and finally the parallelism of the rays to the 
axis is a mark that their angle of incidence coincides 
with one of these equal angles the three marks 
taken together are therefore a mark of all these three 
things united but the three united are evidently a 
mark that the angle of reflexion must coincide with 
the other of the two equal angles that formed by a 
line drawn to the focus and this again by the funda 
mental axiom concerning straight lines is a mark 
that the reflected rays pass through the focus most 
chains of physical deduction are of this more com • 
pucated type and even in mathematics such are 
abundant as in all propositions where the hypothesis 
includes numerous conditions tjf a circle be taken 
and if within that circle a point be taken not the 
centre and if straight lines be drawn from that point 
to the circumference then c 

§ the considerations now stated remove a 
serious difficulty from the view we have taken of 
reasoning which view might otherwise have seemed 
not easily reconcilable with the fact that there are 
deductive or ratiocinative sciences it might seem

to follow if all reasoning be induction that the diffi 
culties of philosophical investigation must lie in the 
inductions exclusively and that when these were easy 
and susceptible of no doubt or hesitation there could 
be no science or at leasts no difficulties in science 
the existence for example of an extensive science 
of mathematics requiring the highest scientific genius 
in those who contributed to its creation and calling 
for a most continued and vigorous exertion of intellect 
in order to appropriate it when created may seem 
hard to be accounted for on the foregoing theory 
but the considerations more recently adduced remove 
the mystery by showing that even when the induc 
tions themselves are obvious there may be much 
difficulty in finding whether the particular case which 
is the subject of inquiry comes within them and 
ample room for scientific ingenuity in so combining 
various inductions as by means of one within which 
the case evidently falls to bring it within others in 
which it cannot be directly seen to be included 

when the more obvious of the inductions which 
can be made in any science from direct observations 
have been made and general formulas have been 
framed determining the limits within which these 
inductions are applicable as often as a new case can 
be at once seen to come within one of the formulas 
the induction is applied to the new case and the 
business is ended but new cases are continually 
arising which do not obviously come within any 
formula whereby the questions we want solved in 
respect of them could be answered let us take an 
instance from geometry and as it is taken only for 
illustration let the reader concede to us for the 
present what we shall endeavour to prove in the next 
chapter that the first principles of geometry are

results of induction our example shall be the fifth 
proposition of the first book of euclid the inquiry 
is are the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle 
equal or unequal the first thing to be considered 
is what inductions we have from which we can infer 
equality or inequality for inferring equality we 
have the following formulae — things which being 
applied to each other coincide are equals things 
which are equal to the same thing are equals a 
whole and the sum of its parts are equals the sums 
of equal things are equals the differences of equal 
things are equals there are no other formulae to 
prove equality for inferring inequality we have the 
following — a whole and its parts are unequals the 
sums of equal things and unequal things are unequals 
the differences of equal things and unequal things are 
unequals in all eight formulae the angles at the 
base of an isosceles triangle do not obviously come 
within any of these the formulae specify certain 
marks of equality and of inequality but the angles 
cannot be perceived intuitively to have any of those 
marks we can however examine whether they 
have properties which in any other formulae are set 
down as marks of those marks on examination it 
appears that they have and we ultimately suc 
ceed in bringing them within this formula the 
differences of equal things are equal whence 
comes the difficulty in recognising these angles as 
the differences of equal things because each of 
them is the difference not of one pair only but of 
innumerable pairs of angles and out of these we had 
to imagine and select two which could either be 
intuitively perceived to be equals or possessed some 
of the marks of equality set down in the various 
formulae by an exercise of ingenuity which on the

trains of reasoning 

part of the first inventor deserves to be regarded as 
considerable two pairs of angles were hit upon which 
united these requisites first it could be perceived 
intuitively that their difierences were the angles at 
the base and secondly they possessed one of the 
marks of equality namely coincidence when applied 
to one another this coincidence however was not 
perceived intuitively but inferred in conformity to 
another formula 

to make all clear we subjoin an analysis of 
the demonstration euclid it will be remembered 
demonstrates his fifth proposition by means of the 
fourth this it is not allowable for us to do because 
we are undertaking to trace deductive truths not to 
prior deductions but to their original inductive foun 
dation we must therefore use the premisses of the 
fourth proposition instead of 
its conclusion and prove 
the fifth directly from first 
principles to do so re 
quires six formulas we 
must begin as in euclid by 
prolonging the equal sides 
a b a c to equal distances 
and joining the extremities

first formula the sums of equals are equal 

a d and a e are sums of equals by the supposi 
tion having that mark of equality they are con 
cluded by this formula to be equal

to one another coincide 
a c a b are within this formula by supposition 
ad a e have been brought within it by the pre

ceding step both these pairs of straight lines have 
the property of equality which according to the 
second formula is a mark that if applied to each 
other they will coincide coinciding altogether 
means coinciding in every part and of course at their 
extremities d e and b c 

third formula straight linesy having their extremi 
ties coincident coincide 

b e and d c have been brought within this for 
mula by the preceding induction they will therefore 
coincide 

fourth formula angles having their sides coinci 
denty coincide 

the two previous inductions having shown that 
b e and d c coincide and that a d a e coincide 
the angles abe and acd are thereby brought 
within the fourth formula and accordingly coincide 

fifth formula things which coincide are equal 

the angles abe and a cd are brought within 
this formula by the induction immediately preceding 
this train of reasoning being also applicable mutatis 
mutandis j to the angles e b c d c b these also are 
brought within the fifth formula and finally 

sixth formula the differences of equals are equal 

the angle abc being the difference of abe 
c b e and the angle a c b being the difference of 
a c b d c b which have been proved to be equals 
abc and acb are brought within the last for 
mula by the whole of the previous process 

the difficulty here encountered is chiefly that of

triangle abc as remainders made by cutting one

pair of angles out of another while each pair shall be 
corresponding angles of triangles which have two 
sides and the intervening angle equal it is by this 
happy contrivance that so many different inductions 
are brought to bear upon the same particular case 
and this not being at all an obvious idea it may be 
seen from an example so near the threshold of mathe 
matics how much scope there may well be for scien 
tific dexterity in the higher branches of that and other 
sciences in order so to combine a few simple induc 
tions as to bring within each of them innumerable 
cases which are not obviously included in it and how 
long and numerous and complicated may be the 
processes necessary for bringing the inductions toge 
ther even when each induction may itself be very 
easy and simple all the inductions involved in all 
geometry are comprised in those simple ones the 
formulae of which are the axioms and a few of the 
socalled definitions the remainder of the science 
is made up of the processes employed for bringing 
unforeseen cases within these inductions or in syllo 
gistic language for proving the minors necessary to 
complete the syllogisms the majors being the defini 
tions and axioms in those definitions and axioms are 
laid down the whole of the marks by an artful combi 
nation of which men have been able to discover and 
prove all that is proved in geometry the marks 
being so few and the inductions which furnish them 
being so obvious and familiar the connecting of several 
of them together which constitutes deductions or

scientific reasons for giving to every science as much 
of the character of a deductive science as possible 
for endeavouring to construct the science from the 
fewest and the simplest possible inductions and to 
make these by any combinations however compli 
cated suffice for proving even such truths relating 
to complex cases as could be proved if we chose by 
inductions from specific experience every branch 
of natural philosophy was originally experimental 
each generalization rested upon a special induction 
and was derived from its own distinct set of observa 
tions and experiments from being sciences of pure 
experiment as the phrase is or to speak more cor 
rectly sciences in which the reasonings consist of no 
more than one step and are expressed by single syllo 
gisms all these sciences have become to some extent 
and some of them in nearly the whole of their extent 
sciences of pure reasoning whereby multitudes of 
truths already known by induction from as many 
different sets of experiments have come to be exhi 
bited as deductions or corollaries from inductive pro 
positions of a simpler and more universal character 
thus mechanics hydrostatics optics acoustics and 
thermology have successively been rendered mathe 
matical and astronomy was brought by newton 
within the laws of general mechanics why it is that 
the substitution of this circuitous mode of proceed 
ing for a process apparently much easier and more 
natural is held and justly to be the greatest triumph 
of the investigation of nature we are not in this 
stage of our inquiry prepared to examine but it is 
necessary to remark that although by this progressive 
transformation all sciences tend to become more and 
more deductive they are not therefore the less induc 
tive every step in the deduction is still an induction

the opposition is not between the terms deductive 
and inductive but between deductive and experi 
mental a science is experimental in proportion as 
every new case which presents any peculiar features 
stands in need of a new set of observations and expe 
riments a fresh induction it is deductive in pro 
portion as it can draw conclusions respecting cases 
of a new kind by processes which bring those cases 
under old inductions by ascertaining that cases which 
cannot be observed to have the requisite marks have 
however marks of those marks 

we can now therefore perceive what is the 
generic distinction between sciences which can be 
made deductive and those which must as yet remain 
experimental the difference consists in our having 
been able or not yet able to discover marks of marks 
if by our various inductions we have been able to pro 
ceed no further than to such propositions as these a a 
mark of or a and b marks of one another c a mark 
of d or c and d marks of one another without any 
thing to connect a or with cor d we have a science 
of detached and mutually independent generalizations 
such as these that acids redden vegetable blues and 
that alkalis colour them green from neither of which 
propositions could we directly or indirectly infer the 
other and a science so far as it is composed of such 
propositions is purely experimental chemistry in 
the present state of our knowledge has not yet thrown 
off this character there are other sciences however 
of which the propositions are of this kind a a mark 
of a mark of c c of d d of e c in these 
sciences we can mount the ladder from a to e by a 
process of ratiocination we can conclude that a is a 
mark of e and that every object which has the mark 
a has the property e although perhaps we never

were able to observe a and e together and although 
even c our only direct mark of e may be not per 
ceptible in those objects but only inferrible or 
varying the first metaphor we may be said to get 
from a to e underground the marks c rf which 
indicate the route must all be possessed somewhere by 
the objects concerning which we are inquiring but 
they are below the surface a is the only mark that 
is visible and by it we are able to trace in succession 
all the rest 

 we can now understand how an experimental 
transforms itself into a deductive science by the mere 
progress of experiment in an experimental science 
the inductions as we have said lie detached as a a 
maij£ of c a mark of d e a mark of and so on 
now a new set of instances and a consequent new 
induction may at any time bridge over the interval 
between two of these unconnected arches for 
example may be ascertained to be a mark of c which 
enables us thenceforth to prove deductively that a is a 
mark of c ot as sometimes happens some grand 
comprehensive induction may raise an arch high in 
the air which bridges over hosts of them at once 
 rf and all the rest turning out to be marks of 
some one thing or of things between which a con 
nexion has already been traced as when newton 
discovered that the motions whether regular or appa 
rently anomalous of all the bodies of the solar 
system each of which motions had been inferred by a 
separate logical operation from separate marks were 
all marks of moving round a common centre with a 
centripetal force varying directly as the mass and 
inversely as the square of the distance from that 
centre this is the greatest example which has yet

occurred of the transformation at one stroke of a 
science which was still to a great degree merely expe 
rimental into a deductive science 

transformations of the same nature but on a 
smaller scale continually take place in the less ad 
vanced branches of physical knowledge without ena 
bling them to throw off the character of experimental 
sciences thus with regard to the two unconnected 
propositions before cited namely acids redden vege 
table blues alkalis make them green it is remarked 
by liebig that all blue colouring matters which are 
reddened by acids as well as reciprocally all red 
colouring matters which are rendered blue by alkalis 
contain nitrogen and it is quite possible to conceive 
that this circumstance may one day furnish a bond of 
connexion between the two propositions in question 
by showing that the antagonist action of acids and 
alkalis in producing or destroying the colour blue is 
the result of some one more general law although 
this connecting of detached generalizations is so much 
gain it tends but little to give a deductive character 
to any science as a whole because the new courses 
of observation and experiment which thus enable us 
to connect together a few gieral truths usually 
make known to us a still greater number of uncon 
nected new ones hence chemistry though similar 
extensions and simplifications of its generalizations 
are continually taking place is still in the main an 
experimental science and is likely so to continue 
unless some comprehensive induction should be here 
after arrived at which like newtons shall connect a 
vast number of the smaller known inductions toge 
ther and change the whole method of the science at 
once chemistry has already one great generalization 
which though relating to one of the subordinate

aspects of chemical phenomena possesses within its 
limited sphere this comprehensive character the 
principle of dalton called the atomic theory or the 
doctrine of chemical equivalents which by enabung 
us to a certain extent to foresee the proportions in 
which two substances will combine before the experi 
ment has been tried constitutes undoubtedly a source 
of new chemical truths obtainable by deduction as 
well as a connecting principle for all truths of the 
bame description previously obtained by experiment 

§ the discoveries which change the method of 
a science from experimental to deductive mostly con 
sist in establishing either by deduction or by direct 
experiment that the varieties of a particular pheno 
menon uniformly accompany the varieties of some 
other phenomenon better known thus the science 
of sound which previously stood in the lowest rank 
of merely experimental science became deductive 
when it was proved by experiment that every variety 
of sound was consequent upon and therefore a mark 
of a distinct and definable variety of oscillatory mo 
tion among the particles of the transmitting medium 
when this was ascertained it followed that every 
relation of succession or coexistence which obtained 
between phenomena of the more known class 
obtained also between the phenomena which corre 
sponded to them in the other class every sound 
being a mark of a particular oscillatory motion 
became a mark of everything which by the laws of 
dynamics was known to be inferrible from that 
motion and everything which by those same laws 
was a mark of any oscillatory motion became a mark 
of the corresponding sound and thus many truths 
not before suspected concerning sound became dedu

cible from the known laws of the propagation of motion 
through an elastic medium while facts already empi 
rically known respecting sound became an indication 
of corresponding properties of vibrating bodies pre 
viously xmdiscovered 

but the grand agent for transforming experimental 
into deductive sciences is the science of number the 
properties of numbers alone among all known phe 
nomena are in the most rigorous sense properties 
of all things whatever all things are not coloured 
or ponderable or even extended but all things are 
numerable and if we consider this science in its whole 
extent from common arithmetic up to the calculus of 
variations the truths already ascertained seem all but 
infinite and admit of indefinite extension 

these truths although affirmable of all things 
whatever of course apply to them only in respect of 
their quantity but if it comes to be discovered that 
variations of quality in any class of phenomena corre 
spond regularly to variations of quantity either in 
those same or in some other phenomena every formula 
of mathematics applicable to quantities which vary in 
that particular manner becomes a mark of a corre 
sponding general truth respecting the variations in 
quauty which accompany them and the science of 
 quantity being as far as any science can be altogether 
deductive the theory of that particular kind of 
quauties becomes to this extent deductive ukewise 

the most striking instance in point which history 
affords though not an example of an experimental 
science rendered deductive but of an unparalleled 
extension given to the deductive process in a science 
which was deductive already is the revolution in 
geometry which originated with the illustrious des 
cartes and was completed by clairaut these phi

losophers remarked that to every variety of position 
in points direction in lines or form in curves or 
surfaces all of which are qualities there corre 
sponds a peculiar relation of quantity between either 
two or three rectilineal coordinates insomuch that if 
the law were known according to which those co 
ordinates vary relatively to one another every other 
geometrical property of the line or surface in question 
whether relating to quantity or quality would be 
capable of being inferred hence it followed that every 
geometrical question could be solved if the corre 
sponding algebraical one could and geometry received 
an accession actual or potential of new truths cor 
responding to every property of numbers which the 
progress of the calculus had brought or might in 
future bring to light in the same general manner 
mechanics astronomy and in a less degree every 
branch of natural philosophy commonly so called 
have been made algebraical the varieties of physical 
phenomena with which those sciences are conversant 
have been found to answer to determinable varieties 
in the quantity of some circumstance or other or at 
least to varieties of form or position for which cor 
responding equations of quantity had already been or 
were susceptible of being discovered by geometers 

in these various transformations the propositions 
of the science of number do but fulfil the function 
proper to all propositions forming a train of reasoning 
viz that of enabling us to arrive in an indirect 
method by marks of marks at such of the properties 
of objects as we cannot directly ascertain or not so 
conveniently by experiment we travel from a given 
visible or tangible fact through the truths of numbers

between the one set of quantities to determine that

chapter v 
of demonstration and necessary truths 

 if as laid down in the two preceding chap 
ters the foundation of all sciences even deductive or 
demonstrative sciences is induction if every step in 
the ratiocinations even of geometry is an act of induc 
tion and if a train of reasoning is but bringing many 
inductions to bear upon the same subject of inquiry 
and drawing a case withm one induction by means of 
another wherein lies the peculiar certainty always 
ascribed to the sciences which are entirely or almost 
entirely deductive why are they called the exact 
sciences why are mathematical certainty and the 
evidence of demonstration common phrases to express 
the very highest degree of assurance attainable by 
reason why are mathematics by almost all philo 
sophers and by many even those branches of natural 
philosophy which through the medium of mathe 
matics have been converted into deductive sciences 
considered to be independent of the evidence of 
experience and observation and characterised as 
systems of necessary truth 

the answer i conceive to be that this character 
of necessity ascribed to the truths of mathematics 
and even with some reservations to be hereafter 
made the peculiar certainty attributed to them is 
an illusion in order to sustain which it is necessary 
to suppose that those truths relate to and express 
the properties of purely imaginary objects it is 
acknowledged that the conchisions of geometry are

tions and that those definitions are assumed to be 
correct descriptions as far as they go of the objects 
with which gmetry is conversant now we have 
pointed out that from a definition as such no propo 
sition unless it be one concerning the meaning f a 
word can ever follow and that what apparently 
follows from a definition follows in reality from an 
implied assumption that there exists a real thing con 
formable thereto this assumption in the case of 
the definitions of geometry is false there exist no 
real things exactly conformabfe to the definitions 
there exist no points without magnitude no lines 
without breadth nor perfectly straight no circles 
with all their radii exactly equal nor squares with 
all their angles perfectly right it will perhaps be 
said that the assumption does not extend to the 
actual but only to the possible existence of such 
things i answer that according to any test we have 
of possibility they are not even possible their exist 
ence so far as we can form any judgment would 
seem to be inconsistent with the physical constitution 
gf our planet at least if not of the universe to get 
rid of this difficulty and at the same time to save the 
credit of the supposed systems of necessary truth it 
is customary to say that the points lines circles and 
squares which are the subject of geometry exist in our 
conceptions merely and are part of our minds which 
minds by working on their own materials construct 
an a priori science the evidence of which is purely 
mental and has nothing whatever to do with outward 
experience by howsoever high authorities this doc 
trine may have been sanctioned it appears to me 
psychologically incorrect the points lines circles 
and squares which any one has in his mind are i 
apprehend simply copies of the points hues circles

and squares which he has known in his experience 
a line as defined by geometers is wholly mconceivable 
we can reason about a line as if it had no breadth 
because we have a power which is the foundation of 
all the control we can exercise over the operations of 
our minds the power when a perception is present to 
our senses or a conception to our intellects of attend 
ing to a part only of that perception or conception 
instead of the whole but we cannot conceive a line 
without breadth we can form no mental picture of 
such a line all the lines which we have in our minds 
are lines possessing breadth if any one doubts this 
we may refer him to his own experience i much 
question if any one who fancies that he can conceive 
what is called a mathematical line thinks so from the 
evidence of his consciousness i suspect it is rather 
because he supposes that unless such a conception 
were possible mathematics could not exist as a 
science a supposition which there will be no difficulty 
in showing to be entirely groundless 

since then neither in nature nor in the human mind 
do there exist any objects exactly corresponding to the 
definitions of geometry while yet that science cannot 
be supposed to be conversant about nonentities 
nothing remains but to consider geometry as conver 
sant with such lines angles and figures as really 
exist and the definitions as they are called must be 
regarded as some of our first and most obvious gene 
rauzations concerning those natural objects the cor 
rectness of those generalizations as generalizations is 
without a flaw the equality of all the radii of a circle 
is true of all circles so far as it is true of any one 
but it is not exactly true of any circle it is only nearly 
true so nearly that no error of any importance in prac 
tice will be incurred by feigning it to be exactly true

when we have occasion to extend these mductions or 
their consequences to cases in which the error would 
be appreciable — to lines of perceptible breadth or thick 
ness parallels which deviate sensibly from equidistance 
and the like — we correct our conclusions by combining 
with them a fresh set of propositions relating to the 
aberration just as we also take in propositions relating 
to thp physical or chemical properties of the material 
if those properties happen to introduce any modifica 
tion into the result which they easily may even with 
respect to figure and magnitude as in the case for 
instance of expansion by heat so long however as 
there exists no practical necessity for attending to any 
of the properties of the object except its geometrical pro 
perties or to any of the natural irregularities in those 
it is convenient to neglect the consideration of the other 
properties and of the irregularities and to reason as if 
these did not exist accordingly we formally announce 
in the definitions that we intend to proceed on this 
plan but it is an error to suppose because we resolve 
to confine our attention to a certain number of the 
properties of an object that we therefore conceive 
or have an idea of the object denuded of its other 
properties we are thinking all the time of precisely 
such objects as we have seen and touched and with 
all the properties which naturally belong to them 
but for scientific convenience we feign them to be 
divested of all properties except those in regard to 
which we design to consider them 

the peculiar accuracy supposed to be charac 
teristic of the first principles of geometry thus appears 
to be fictitious the assertions on which the reason

tracing the consequences which follow from the sup 
position the opinion of dugald stewart respecting 
the foundations of geometry is i conceive substan 
tially correct that it is built upon hypotheses that 
it owes to this alone the peculiar certainty supposed 
to distinguish it and that in any science whatever 
by reasoning from a set of hypotheses we may obtain 
a body of conclusions as certain as those of geometry 
that is as strictly in accordance with the hypotheses 
and as irresistibly compellmg assent on condition that 
those hypotheses are true 

when therefore it is affirmed that the conclusions 
of geometry are necessary truths the necessity con 
sists in reality only in this that they necessarily follow 
from the suppositions from which they are deduced 
those suppositions are so far from being necessary 
that they are not even true they purposely depart 
more or less widely from the truth the only sense 
in which necessity can be ascribed to the conclusions 
of any scientific investigation is that of necessarily 
following from some assumption which by the con 
ditions of the inquiry is not to be questioned in 
this relation of course the derivative truths of every 
deductive science must stand to the mductions or 
assumptions on which the science is founded and 
which whether true or untrue certain or doubtful in 
themselves are always supposed certain for the pur 
poses of the particular science and therefore the 
conclusions of all deductive sciences were said by the 
ancients to be necessary propositions we have 
observed already that to be predicated necessarily was 
characteristic of the predicable proprium and that a 
proprium was any property of a thing which could be 
deduced from its essence that is from the properties 
included in its definition

demonstration and necessary truths 

 the important doctrine of dugald stewart 
which i have endeavoured to enforce has been con 
tested by a living philosopher mr whewell both in 
the dissertation appended to his excellent mechanical 
euclid and in his more recent elaborate work on the 
philosophy of the inductive sciences in which last he 
also replies to an article in the edinburgh review 
ascribed to a writer of great scientific eminence in 
which stewarts opinion was defended against his 
former strictures mr whewells mode of refuting 
stewart is to prove against him as has also been done 
in this work that the premisses of geometry are not 
definitions but assumptions of the real existence of 
things corresponding to those definitions this how 
ever is doing little for mr whewells purpose for it 
is these very assumptions which we say are hypotheses 
and which he if he denies that geometrj is founded 
on hjrpotheses must show to be absolute truths all 
he does however is to observe that they at any 
rate are not arbitrary hypotheses that we should 
not be at liberty to substitute other hypotheses for 
them that not only a definition to be admissible 
must necessarily refer to and agree with some con 
ception which we can distinctly frame in our 
thoughts but that the straight unes for instance 
which we define must be those by which angles are 
contained those by which triangles are bounded those 
of which parallelism may be predicated and the 
like and this is true but this has never been 
contradicted those who say that the premisses of 
geometry are hypotheses are not bound to maintain 
them to be hypotheses which have no relation what

ever to fact since an hypothesis framed for the 
purpose of scientific inquiry must relate to something 
which has real existence for there can be no science 
respecting nonentities it follows that any hypothesis 
we make respecting an object to faciutate our study 
of it must not involve anything which is distinctly 
false and repugnant to its real nature we must not 
ascribe to the thing any property which it has not 
our liberty extends only to suppressing some of those 
which it has under the indispensable obligation of 
restoring them whenever and in as far as their 
presence or absence would make any material differ 
ence in the truth of our conclusions of this nature 
accordingly are the first principles involved in the 
definitions of geometry in their positive part they 
are observed facts it is only in their negative part 
that they are hypothetical that the hypotheses should 
be of this particular character is however no further 
necessary than inasmuch as no others could enable 
us to deduce conclusions which with due corrections 
would be true of real objects and in fact when our 
aim is only to illustrate truths and not to investigate 
them we are not under any such restriction we 
might suppose an imaginary animal and work out by 
deduction from the known laws of physiology its 
natural history or an imaginary commonwealth and 
from the elements composing it might argue what 
would be its fate and the conclusions which we 
might thus draw from purely arbitrary hypotheses 
might form a highly useful intellectual exercise but 
as they could only teach us what would be the pro 
perties of objects which do not really exist they 
would not constitute any addition to our knowledge 
while on the contrary if the hypothesis merely divests 
a real object of some portion of its properties without

clothing it in false ones the conclusions will always 
express under known liability to correction actual 
truth 

 but although mr whewell has not shaken 
stewarts doctrine as to the hypothetical character of 
that portion of the first principles of geometry which 
are involved in the socalled definitions he has i 
conceive greatly the advantage of stewart on another 
important point in the theory of geometrical reasoning 
the necessity of admitting among those first principles 
axioms as well as definitions some of the axioms of 
euclid might no doubt be exhibited in the form of 
definitions or might be deduced by reasoning from 
propositions similar to what are so called thus if 
instead of the axiom magnitudes which can be made 
to coincide are equal we introduce a definition 
 equal magnitudes are those which maybe so applied 
to one another as to coincide the three axioms which 
follow magnitudes which are equal to the same are 
equal to one another — if equals are added to equals 
the sums are equal — if equals are taken from equals 
the remainders are equal may be proved by an 
imaginary superposition resembling that by which 
the fourth proposition of the first book of euclid is 
demonstrated but although these and several others 
may be struck out of the list of first principles 
becajise though not requiring demonstration they are 
susceptible of it there will be found in the list of 
axioms two or three fimdamental truths not capable 
of being demonstrated among which i agree with 
mr whewell in placing the proposition that two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space or its equivalent 
straight lines which coincide in two points coincide 
altogether and some property of parallel lines other

than that which constitutes their definition the most 
suitable perhaps being that selected by professor 
playfair two straight lines which intersect each 
other cannot both of them be parallel to a third straight 
line 

the axioms as well those which are indemon 
strable as those which admit of being demonstrated 
differ from that other class of fundamental principles 
which are involved in the definitions in this that 
they are true without any mixture of hypothesis 
that things which are equal to the same thing are 
equal to one another is as true of the lines and 
figures in nature as it would be of the imaginary ones 
assumed in the definitions in this respect however 
mathematics are only on a par with most other 
sciences in almost all sciences there are some 
general propositions which are exactly true while the 
greater part are only more or less distant approxima 
tions to the truth thus in mechanics the first law 
of motion the continuance of a movement once 
impressed until stopped or slackened by some resisting 
force is true without a particle of qualification or 



 we mijrht it is true insert this property into the definition of 
parallel lines framing the definition so as to require both that when 
produced indefinitely they shall never meet and auo that any 
straight line which intersects one of them shall if prolonged meet 
the other but by doing this we by no means get rid of the 
assumption we are still obliged to take for granted the geometrical 
truth that all straight lines in the same plane which have the 
former of these properties have also the latter for if it were 
possible that they should not that is if any straight lines other 
than those which are parallel according to the definition had the 
property of never meeting although indefinitely produced the 
demonstrations of the subsequent portions of the theory of parallels 
could not be maintained

are others as for instance the propositions respecting 
the figure of the earth which are but approximations 
to the truth and in order to use them for the further 
advancement of our knowledge we must feign that 
they are exactly true although they really want some 
thing of being so 

§ it remains to inquire what is the ground of 
our belief in axioms — what is the evidence on which 
they rest i answer they are experimental truths 
generalizations from observation the proposition 
ivo straight lines cannot inclose a space — or in othei 
words two straight lines which have once met do 
not meet again but continue to diverge — is an induc 
tion from the evidence of our senses 

this opinion runs counter to a philosophic pre 
judice of long standing and great strength and there is 
probably no one proposition enunciated in this work for 
which a more unfavourable reception is to be expected 
it is however no new opinion and even if it were 
so would be entitled to be judged not by its novelty 
but by the strength of the arguments by which it can 
be supported i consider it very fortunate that so 
eminent a champion of the contrary opinion as mr 
whewell has recently found occasion for a most 
elaborate treatment of the whole theory of axioms in

attempting to construct the philosophy of the mathe 
matical and physical sciences on the basis of the 
doctrine against which i now contend whoever is 
anxious that a discussion should go to the bottom of 
the subject must rejoice to see the opposite side of the 
question worthily represented if what is said by 
such a man as mr whewell in support of an opinion 
which he has made the foundation of a systematic 
work can be shown not to be conclusive enough 
will have been done without going further to seek 
stronger arguments and a more powerful adversary 

it is not necessary to show that the truths which 
we call axioms are originally suggested by observa 
tion and that we should never have known that two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space if we had never 
seen a straight line thus much being admitted by 
mr whewell and by all in recent times who have 
adopted his view of the subject but they contend 
that it is not experience which proves the axiom but 
that its truth is perceived a priori by the constitution 
of the mind itself from the first moment when the 
meaning of the proposition is apprehended and without 
any necessity for verifying it by repeated trials as is 
requisite in the case of truths really ascertained by 
observation 

they cannot however but allow that the truth of 
the axiom two straight lines cannot inclose a space 
even if evident independently of experience is also 
evident from experience whether the axiom needs 
confirmation or not it receives confirmation in almost 
every instant of our lives since we cannot look at any 
two straight lines which intersect one another without 
seeing that from that point they continue to diverge 
more and more experimental proof crowds in upon 
us in such endless profusion and without one instance

in which there can be even a suspicion of an excep 
tion to the rule that we should soon have a stronger 
ground for believing the axiom even as an experi 
mental truth than we have for almost any of the 
general truths which we confessedly learn from the 
evidence of our senses independently of a priori 
evidence we should certainly believe it with an inten 
sity of conviction far greater than we accord to any 
ordinary physical truth and this too at a time of life 
much earlier than that from which we date almost any 
part of our acquired knowledge and much too early 
to admit of our retaining any recollection of the 
history of our intellectual operations at that period 
where then is the necessity for assuming that our recog 
nition of these truths has a different origin from the 
rest of our knowledge when its existence is perfectly 
accounted for by supposing its origin to be the same 
when the causes which produce beuef in all other 
instances exist in this instance and in a degree of 
strength as much superior to what exists in other 
cases as the intensity of the belief itself is superior 
the burden of proof lies upon the advocates of the 
contrary opinion it is for them to point out some 
fact inconsistent with the supposition that this part of 
our knowledge of nature is derived from the same 
sources as every other part 

this for instance they would be able to do if 
they could prove chronologically that we have the 
conviction at least practically so early in infancy as 
to be anterior to those impressions on the senses 
upon which on the other theory the conviction is 
founded this however cannot be proved the point 
being too feir back to be within the reach of memory 
and too obscure for external observation the advo 
cates of the d priori theory are obliged to have

 reasoning 

recourse to other arguments these are reducible to 
two which i shall endeavour to state as clearly and 
as forcibly as possible 

§ in the first place it is said that if our assent 
to the proposition that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space were derived from the senses we 
could only be convinced of its truth by actual trial 
that is by seeing or feeling the straight lines whereas 
in fact it is seen to be true by merely thinking of 
them that a stone thrown into water goes to 
the bottom may be perceived by our senses but 
mere thinking of a stone thrown into the water will 
never lead us to that conclusion not so however 
with the axioms relating to straight lines if i could 
be made to conceive what a straight line is without 
having seen one i should at once recognise that two 
such lines cannot inclose a space intuition is 
imaginary looking but experience must be real 
looking if we see a property of straight lines to be 
true by merely fancying ourselves to be looking at 
them the ground of our belief cannot be the senses 
or experience it must be something mental 

to this argument it might be added in the case 
of this particular axiom for the assertion would not 
be true of all axioms that the evidence of it from 
actual ocular inspection is not only unnecessary but 
unattainable what says the axiom that two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space that after 
having once intersected if they are prolonged to 
infinity they do not meet but continue to diverge 
from one another how can this in any single case 
be proved by actual observation we may follow

the lines to any distance we please but we cannot 
follow them to infinity for aught our senses can 
testify they may immediately beyond the farthest 
point to which we have traced them begin to approach 
and at last meet unless therefore we had some 
other proof of the impossibility than observation 
affords us we should have no ground for believing 
the axiom at all 

to these arguments which i trust i cannot be 
accused of understating a satisfactory answer will i 
conceive be found if we advert to one of the charac 
teristic properties of geometrical forms — their capacity 
of being painted in the imagination with a distinctness 
equal to reality in other words the exact resemblance 
of our ideas of form to the sensations which suggest 
them this in the first place enables us to make 
at least with a little practice mental pictured of all 
possible combinations of lines and angles which 
resemble the realities quite as well as any which we 
could make upon paper and in the next place makes 
those pictures just as fit subjects of geometrical 
experimentation as the realities themselves inasmuch 
as pictures if sufficiently accurate exhibit of course 
all the properties which would be manifested by the 
realities at one given instant and on simple inspec 
tion and in geometry we are concerned only with 
such properties and not with that which pictures 
could not exhibit the mutual action of bodies one 
upon another the foundations of geometry would 
therefore be laid in direct experience even if the 
experiments which in this case consist merely in 
attentive contemplation were practised solely upon 
what we call our ideas that is upon the diagrams in 
our minds and not upon outward objects for in all 
systems of experimentation we take some objects to 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 reasoning 

serve as representatives of all which resemhle them 
and in the present case the conditions which qualify a 
real object to be the representative of its class are 
completely fulfilled by an object existing only in our 
fancy without denying therefore the possibility of 
satisfying ourselves that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space by merely thinking of straight lines 
without actually looking at them i contend that we 
do not believe this truth on the ground of the imagi 
nary intuition simply but because we know that the 
imaginary lines exactly resemble real ones and that 
we may conclude from them to real ones with quite as 
much certainty as we could conclude from one real 
line to another the conclusion therefore is still an 
induction from observation and we should not be 
authorized to substitute observation of the image in 
our mind for observation of the reality if we had not 
learnt by long continued experience that all the pro 
perties of the reality are faithfuuy represented in the 
image just as we should be scientifically warranted 
in describing the shape and colour of an animal which 
we had never seen from a photogenic picture made of 
it with a daguerreotype but not until we had learnt 
by ample experience that observation of such a 
picture is precisely equivalent to observation of the 
original 

these considerations also remove the objection 
arising from the impossibility of ocularly following 
the lines in their prolongation to infinity for though 
in order actually to see that two given lines never 
meet it would be necessary to follow them to infinity 
yet without doing so we may know that if they ever 
do meet or indeed if after diverging from one ano 
ther they begin again to approach this must take 
place not at an infinite but at a finite distance sup

demonstration akd necessary truths 

posing therefore such to be the case we can trans 
port ourselves thither in imagination and can frame a 
mental image of the appearance which one or both of 
the lines must present at that point which we may 
rely upon as being precisely similar to the reauty 
now whether we fix our contemplation upon this 
imaginary picture or call to mind the generalizations 
we have had occasion to make from former ocular 
observation we shall either way be equally satisfied 
that a line which after diverging from another straight 
line begins to approach to it produces the impression 
on our senses which we describe by the expression 
 a bent line not by the expression a straight 
line 

§ the first of the two great arguments in support 
of the theory that axioms are a priori truths having 
i think been sufficiently answered i proceed to the 
second on which most stress is usually laid and which 
is chiefly insisted upon by mr whewell axioms 
it is asserted are conceived by us not only as true 
but as universally and necessarily true now experi 
ence cannot possibly give to any proposition this 
character i may have seen snow a hundred times 
and may have seen that it was white but this cannot 
give me entire assurance even that all snow is white 
much less that snow must be white however many 
instances we may have observed of the truth of a 
proposition there is nothing to assure us that the 
next case shall not be an exception to the rule if it 
be strictly true that every ruminant animal yet known 
has cloven hoofs we still cannot be sure that some 
creature will not hereafter be discovered which has the 
first of these attributes without having the other 
experience must always consist of a limited number

of observations and however numerous these may 
be they can show nothing with regard to the infinite 
number of cases in which the experiment has not been 
made moreover axioms are not only universal they 
are also necessary now experience cannot oflter 
the smallest ground for the necessity of a proposition 
she can observe and record what has happened but 
she cannot find in any case or in any accumulation 
of cases any reason for what nmst happen she may 
see objects side by side but she cannot see a reason 
why they must ever be side by side she finds certain 
events to occur in succession but the succession 
supplies in its occurrence no reason for its recur 
rence she contemplates external objects but she 
cannot detect any internal bond which indissolubly 
connects the future with the past the possible with 
the real to learn a proposition by experience and 
to see it to be necessarily true are two altogether 
dijflferent processes of thought and mr whewell 
adds if any one does not clearly comprehend this 
distinction of necessary and contingent truths he will 
not be able to go along with us in our researches into 
the foundations of human knowledge nor indeed to 
pursue with success any speculation on the subjectf 
in order to learn what the distinction is the non 
recognition of which incurs this denunciation let us 
refer again to mr whewell necessary truths are 
those in which we not only learn that the proposition 
is true but see that ir must be true in which the 
negation of the truth is not only false but impossible 
in which we cannot even by an effort of imagination 
or in a supposition conceive the reverse of that which

doubted we may take for example all relations of 
number three and two added together make five 
we cannot conceive it to be otherwise we cannot 
by any freak of thought imane three and two to 
make seven 

although mr whewell has naturally and properly 
employed a variety of phrases to bring his meaning 
more forcibly home he will i presume allow that 
they are all equivalent and that what he means by 
a necessary truth would be sufficiently defined a 
proposition the negation of which is not only false 
but inconceivable i am unable to find in any of 
mr whewells expressions turn them what way you 
will a meaning beyond this and i do not believe he 
would contend that they mean anything more 

this therefore is the principle asserted that pro 
positions the negation of which is inconceivable or 
in other words which we cannot figure to ourselves 
as being false must rest upon evidence of a higher 
and more cogent description than any which experi 
ence can afford and we have next to consider 
whether there is any ground for this assertion 

now i cannot but wonder that so much stress 
should be laid upon the circumstance of inconceiv 
ableness when there is such ample experience to 
show that our capacity or incapacity of conceiving a 
thing has very little to do with the possibility of the

result of the fundamental laws of the human mind

together and have never in any one instance either 
seen or thought of them separately there is by the 
primary law of association an increasing difficulty 
which in the end becomes insuperable of conceiving 
the two things apart this is most of all conspicuous 
in uneducated persons who are in general utterly 
unable to separate any two ideas which have once 
become firmly associated in their minds and if per 
sons of cultivated intellect have any advantage on the 
point it is only because having seen and heard and 
read more and being more accustomed to exercise 
their imagination they have experienced their sensa

have been prevented from forming many of these 
inseparable associations but this advantage has 
necessarily its limits the man of the most prac

of our conceptive faculty if daily habit presents to 
him for a long period two facts in combination and 
if he is not led during that period either by accident 
or intention to think of them apart he will in time 
become incapable of doing so even by the strongest 
effirt and the supposition that the two facts can be

faith of a general proposition the reverse of which 
seemed to them to be inconceivable — the proposition 
that a body cannot act where it is not all the 
cumbrous machinery of imaginary vortices assumed 
without the smallest particle of evidence appeared 
to these philosophers a more rational mode of explain

conceiving another instant after it nor is there any 
necessity to assmne as is done by the school to

inherent in our conceptions of space and time that 
apparent infinity is suflbiciently accounted for by simpler 
and universally acknowledged laws

what analogy have we what similar order of facts in 
any other branch of our experience to facilitate to us

straight lines in order to attempt to conceive them

taught that it was the nature of motion to abate

peddently of experience can there be a more 
striking exemplification than is here afforded of the 
effect of association which we have described philo 
sophers for generations have the most extraordinary 
difficulty in putting certain ideas together they at 
last succeed in doing so and after a sufficient repe 
tition of the process they first fancy a natural bond 
between the ideas then experience a growing difficulty 
which at last by the continuation of the same pro 
gress becomes an impossibility of severing them from 
one another if such be the progress of an experi 
mental conviction of which the date is of yesterday 
and which is in opposition to first appearances how 
must it fare with those which are conformable to 
appearances familiar from the first dawn of intelli

that of constant proportions so familiar and intimate 
as to be unable to conceive the one fact without the

more in illustration must be quite superfluous i 
shall only therefore express my satisfaction that so 
long as the progress of scientific instruction has not 
rendered this association as indissoluble in the minds

in the text that they are generalizations from experience and 
supports that opinion by a line of argument strikingly coinciding 
with mine when i state that the whole of the present chapter 
was written before i had seen the article the greater part 
indeed before it was published it is not my object to occupy 
the readers attention with a matter so unimportant as the degree 
of originality which may or may not belong to any portion of my 
own speculations but to obtain for an opinion which is opposed to 
reigning doctrines the recommendation derived from a striking 
concurrence of sentiment between two inquirers entirely independent 
of one another i have much pleasure in citing from a writer of 
the extensive acquirements in physical and metaphrsical know 
ledge and the capacity of sjbtematic thought which the article 
evinces passages so remarkably in unison with my own views as 
the following — 

 the truths of geometry are summed up and embodied in its 
definitions and axioms • let us turn to the axioms and what 
do we find a string of propositions concerning magnitude in the 
abstract which are equally true of space time force number and 
every other magnitude susceptible of aggregation and subdivision 
such propositions where they are not mere definitions as some of 
them are carry their inductive origin on the face of their enun 
ciation those which declare that two straight lines cannot 
inclose a space and that two straight lines which cut one another 
cannot both be parallel to a third are in nality the only ones 
which express characteristic properties of space and these it will 
be worth while to consider more nearly now the only clear 
notion we can form of straightness is uniformity of direction for 
space in its ultimate analjrsis is nothing but an assemblage of 
distances and directions and not to dwell on the notion of 
continued contemplation t mental experience as included in 
the very idea of uniformity nor on that of transfer of the con 
templating being frm point to point and of experience during 
such transfer of the homogeneity of the interval passed over we 
cannot even propose the proposition in an intelligible form to any 
one whose experience ever since he was bom has not assured him 
of the fact the unity of direction or that we cannot march 
from a given point by more than one path direct to the same 
object is matter of practical experience long before it can by 
possibility become matter of abstract thought we cannot cutempt 
mentally to eamnplify the conditume of the auertion in an imaginary 
cae opposed to it without violating our habitual recollection of this

txperiencey mid defcung mr mental picture of space as grounded 
en it what but experience we may ask can possibly assure us 
of the homogeneity of the parts of distance time force and mea 
surable aggregates in general on which the truth of the other 
axioms depends as regards the latter axiom after what has 
been said it must be clear that the very same course of remarks 
equally applies to its case and that its truth is quite as much forced 
on the mind as that of t£e former by daily and hourly experience 
 including cdways he it observed in our notion of experience that 
which is gained by contemplation of the inward picture which the 
mind forms to itself in any proposed ease or which it arbitrarily 
selects as an example — such picture in virtue of the extreme simplicity 
of these primary relations being called up by the imagination with 
as much vividness and clearness as coiud be done by any external 
impression which is the only meaning toe can attach to the word 
intuition as applied to such relations 

and again of the axioms of mechanics — as we admit no 
such propositions other than as truths inductively collected from 
observation even in geometry itself it can hardly be expected that 
in a science of obviously contingent relations we should acquiesce 
in a contrary view let us take one of these axioms and examine 
its evidence for instance that equal forces perpendicularly applied 
at the opposite ends of equal arms of a straight lever will balance 
each other what but experience we may ask in the first place 
can possibly inform us that a force so applied will have any tendency 
to turn the lever on its centre at all or that force can be so 
transmitted along a rigid line perpendicular to its direction as to 
act elsewhere in space than along its own line of action surely 
this is so far from being selfevident that it has even a paradoxical 
appearance which is only to be removed by giving our lever thick 
ness material composition and molecular powers again we con 
clude that the two forces being equal and applied under precisely 
similar circumstances must if they exert any effort at all to turn 
the lever exert equal and opposite efforts but what d priori 
reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely 
circumstances that points which differ in place are similarly 
circumstanced as regards the exertion of force that universal 
space may not have relations to universal force — or at all events 
that the organization of the material universe may not be such as 
to place that portion of space occupied by it in such relations to 
the forces exerted in it as may invalidate the absolute similarity 
of circumstances assumed or we may argue what have we to do

with the notion of angular moyement in the lever ai all the 
case is one of rest and of quiescent destruction of force hj force 
now how is this destruction effected assuredly by the counter 
pressure which supports the fulcrum but would not this destruc 
tion equally arise and by the same amount of counteracting force 
if each force simply pressed its own half of the lerer against the 
fulcrum and what can assure us that it is not so except removal 
of one or other force and consequent tilting of the lever the 
other fundamental axiom of statics that the pressure on the point 
of support is the sum of the weights is merely a scientific 
transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse and obvious 
result of universal experience viz that the weight of a rigid body 
is the same handle it or suspend it in what position or by what 
point we will and that whatever sustains it sustains its total 
weight assuredly as mr whewell justly remaiks no one 
probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the 
pressure on the support is equal to the sum of the weights 
but it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest 
infancy he has been continually making the trial and seeing it 
made by every other living being about him that he never dreams 
of staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific 
accuracy this would be as if a man should resolve to decide 
by experiment vehether his eyes were useful for the purpose of 
seeing by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a 
metal case 

on the paradox of universal propositions obtained by expe 
rience the same writer says if there be necessary and universal 
truths expressible in propositions of axiomatic simplicity and obvious 
ness and having for their subjectmatter the elements of all our 
experience and all our knowledge surely these are the truths 
which if experience suggest to us any truths at all it onght to 
suggest most readily clearly and unceasingly if it were a truth 
universal and necessary that a net is spread over the whole surce 
of erery planetary globe we should not travel far on our own 
vrithout getting entangled in its meshes and making the necessity 
of some means of extrication an axiom of locomotion there 
is therefore nothing paradoxical but the reverse in our being led 
by observation to a recognition of such truths as general propo 
sitions coextensive at least with all human experience that they 
pervade all the objects of experience must ensure their continual 
suggestion by experience that they are true musk ensure that 
consistency of suggestion that iteration of uncontradicted assertion

another high authority if indeed it be another authority may 
be cited in favour of the doctrine that axiorof test upon the evidence 
of induction the axioms of geometry themselves may be 
regarded as in some sort an appeal to experience not corporeal but 
mental when we say the whole is greater than its part we 
announce a general fact which rests it is true on our ideas of 
whole and part but in abstracting these notions we begin by 
considering them as subsisting in space and time and body and

say the equals of equals are equal we mentally make comparisons 
in equal spaces equal times c so that these axioms however 
selfevident are still general propositions so r of the inductive 
kind that independently of experience they would not present 
themselves to the mind the only difference between these and 
axioms obtained from extensive induction is this that in raising 
the axioms of geometry the instances ofier themselves spontaneously

chapter vi 

the same subject continued 

 in the examination which formed the subject 
of the last chapter into the nature of the evidence of 
those deductive sciences which are commonly repre 
sented to be systems of necessary truth we have 
been led to the following conclusions the results 
of those sciences are indeed necessary in the sense 
of necessarily following from certain first prin 
ciples commonly called axioms and definitions of 
being certainly true if those axioms and definitions 
are so but their claim to the character of necessity 
in any sense beyond this as impljdng an evidence 
independent of and superior to observation and expe 
rience must depend upon the previous establishment 
of such a claim in favour of the definitions and axioms 
themselves with regard to axioms we found that 
considered as experimental truths they rest upon 
superabundant and obvious evidence we inquired 
whether since this is the case it be necessary to 
suppose any other evidence of those truths than 
experimental evidence any other origin for our belief 
of them than an experimental origin we decided 
that the burden of proof lies with those who maintain 
the afiirmative and we examined at considerable 
length such arguments as they have produced the 
examination having led to the rejection of those 
arguments we have thought ourselves warranted in 
concluding that axioms are but a class the highest 
class of inductions from experience the simplest

and easiest cases of generalization from the facts 
furnished to us by our senses or by our internal 
consciousness 

while the axioms of demonstrative sciences thus 
appeared to be experimental truths the definitions as 
they are incorrectly called of those sciences were 
found by us to be generalizations from experience 
which are not even accurately speaking truths 
being propositions in which while we assert of some 
kind of object some property or properties which 
observation shows to belong to it we at the same 
time deny that it possesses any other properties 
although in truth other properties do in every indi 
vidual instance accompany and in most or even in 
all instances modify the property thus exclusively 
predicated the denial therefore is a mere fiction 
or supposition made for the purpose of excluding the 
consideration of those modifying circumstances when 
their influence is of too trifling amount to be worth 
considering or adjourning it when important to a 
more convenient moment 

from these considerations it would appear that 
deductive or demonstrative sciences are all without 
exception inductive sciences that their evidence is 
that of experience but that they are also in virtue of 
the peculiar character of one indispensable portion of 
the general formulae according to which their induc 
tions are made hypothetical sciences their conclu 
sions are only true upon certain suppositions which 
are or ought to be approximations to the truth but 
are seldom if ever exactly true and to this hypothe 
tical character is to be ascribed the peculiar certainty 
which is supposed to be inherent in demonstration

received as universally true of deductive or demon

strative sciences until verified by being applied to the 
most remarkable of all those sciences that of num 
bers the theory of the calculus arithmetic and 
algebra it b harder to believe of the doctrines of 
this science than of any other either that they are 
not truths a priori but experimental truths or that 
their peculiar certainty is owing to their being not 
absolute but only conditional truths this therefore 
is a case which merits examination apart and the 
more so because on this subject we have a double set 
of doctrines to contend with that of mr whewell 
and the d priori philosophers on one side and on the 
other a philosophical theory the most opposite to 
theirs which was at one time very generally received 
and is still far from being altogether exploded among 
metaphysicians 

 this theory attempts to solve the difficulty 
apparently inherent in the case by representing the 
propositions of the science of numbers as merely ver 
bal and its processes as simple transformations of 
language substitutions of one expression for another 
the proposition two and one are equal to three 
according to these philosophers is not a truth is not 
the assertion of a really existing fact but a definition 
of the word three a statement that mankind have 
agreed to use the name three as a sign exactly equi 
valent to two and one to call by the former name 
whatever is called by the other more clumsy phrase 
according to this doctrine the longest process in 
algebra is but a succession of changes in terminology 
by which equivalent expressions are substituted one 
for another a series of translations of the same fact 
from one into another language though how after 
such a series of translations the fact itself comes out

changed as when we demonstrate a new geometrical 
theorem by algebra they have not explained and it 
is a difficulty which is fatal to their theory 

it must be acknowledged that there are pecuuari 
ties in the processes of arithmetic and algebra which 
render the above theory very plausible and have not 
unnaturally made those sciences the stronghold of 
nominalism the doctrine that we can discover facts 
detect the hidden processes of nature by an artful 
manipulation of language is so contrary to common 
sense that a person must have made some advances 
in philosophy to believe it men fly to so paradoxical 
a belief to avoid as they think some even greater dif 
ficulty which the vulgar do not see what has led 
many to believe that reasoning is a mere verbal 
process is that no other theory seemed reconcileable 
with the nature of the science of numbers for we 
do not carry any ideas along with us when we use the 
symbols of arithmetic or of algebra in a geometrical

seem to have come to one of bacons prerogative 
instances an experimentum crucis on the nature of 
reasoning itself 

nevertheless it will appear on consideration that 
this apparently so decisive instance is no instance at 
all that there is in every step of an arithmetical or 
algebraical calculation a real induction a real infe 
rence of facts from facts and that what disguises the 
induction is simply its comprehensive nature and the 
consequent extreme generality of the language all 
numbers must be nimibers of something there are 
no such things as numbers in the abstract ten must 
mean ten bodies or ten sounds or ten beatings of the 
pulse but though numbers must be numbers of 
something they may be numbers of anything pro 
positions therefore concerning numbers have the 
remarkable peculiarity that they are propositions con 
cerning all things whatever all objects all existences 
of every kind known to our experience all things 
possess quantity consist of parts which can be num 
bered and in that character possess all the proper 
ties which are called properties of numbers that 
half of four is two must be true whatever the word 
four represents whether four men four miles or four 
pounds weight we need only conceive a thing 
divided into four equal parts and all things may be 
conceived as so divided to be able to predicate of it 
every property of the number four that is every 
arithmetical proposition in which the number four 
stands on one side of the equation algebra extends 
the generalization still farther every number repre 
sents that particular number of all things without dis 
tinction but every algebraical symbol does more it 
represents all numbers without distinction as soon 
as we conceive a thing divided into equal parts with

out knowing into what number of parts we may call 
it a or x and apply to it without danger of error 
every algebraical formula in the books the propo 
sition a a is a truth coextensive with 
the creation since then algebraical truths are true 
of all things whatever and not like those of geo 
metry true of lines only or angles only it is no 
wonder that the symbols should not excite in our 
minds ideas of any things in particular when we 
demonstrate the fortyseventh proposition of euclid it 
is not necessary that the words should raise in us an 
image of all rightangled triangles but only of some 
one rightangled triangle so in algebra we need not 
under the symbol a picture to ourselves all things 
whatever but only some one thing why not then 
the letter itself the mere written characters a 
a y z serve as well for representatives of things in 
general as any more complex and apparently more 
concrete conception that we are conscious of them 
however in their character of things and not of mere 
signs is evident from the fact that our whole process 
of reasoning is carried on by predicating of them the 
properties of things in resolving an algebraic equa 
tion by what rules do we proceed by applying at 
each step to a and a the proposition that equals 
added to equals make equals that equals taken from 
equals leave equals and other propositions founded 
upon these two these are not properties of lan 
guage or of signs as such but of magnitudes which 
is as much as to say of all things the inferences 
therefore which are successively drawn are inferences 
concerning things not symbols although as any 
things whatever will serve the turn there is no neces 
sity for keeping the idea of the thing at all distinct

case be allowed without danger to do what all pro 
cesses of thought when they have been performed 
often will do if permitted namely to become entirely 
mechanical hence the general language of algebra 
comes to be used familiarly without exciting ideas as 
all other general language is prone to do from mere 
habit though in no other case than this can it be done 
with complete safety but when we look back to see 
from whence the probative force of the process is 
derived we find that at every single step unless we 
suppose ourselves to be thinking and talking of the 
things and not the mere symbols the evidence fails 

there is another circumstance which still more 
than that which we have now mentioned gives plausi 
bility to the notion that the propositions of arithmetic 
and algebra are merely verbal this is that when 
considered as propositions respecting things they all 
have the appearance of being identical propositions 
the assertion two and one are equal to three consi 
dered as an assertion respecting objects as for instance 
two pebbles and one pebble are equal to three 
pebbles does not affirm equality between two collec 
tions of pebbles but absolute identity it affirms 
that if we put one pebble to two pebbles those very 
pebbles are three the objects therefore being the 
very same and the mere assertion that objects are 
themselves being insignificant it seems but natural 
to consider the proposition two and one are equal to 
three as asserting mere identity of signification 
between the two names 

this however though it looks so plausible will 
not stand examination the expression two peb 
bles and one pebble and the expression three 
pebbles stand indeed for the same aggregation of 
objects but they by no means stand for the same

geometry is a science founded upon definitions but 
they are definitions in the geometrical sense not the 
logical asserting not the meaning of a term only 
but along with it an observed matter of feet the 
proposition a circle is a figure bounded by a line 
which has all its points equally distant from a point 
within it is called the definition of a circle but the 
proposition from which so many consequences follow 
and which is really a first principle of geometry is 
that figures answering to this description exist and 
thus we may call three is two and one a defini 
tion of three but the calculations which depend upon 
that proposition do not follow from the definition 
itself but from an arithmetical theorem presupposed 
in it namely that collections of objects exist which 
while they impress the senses thus may be sepa 
rated into two parts thus co o this proposition 
being granted we term all such parcels threes after 
which the enunciation of the abovementioned phy 
sical fact will serve also for a definition of the word 
three 

the science of number is thus no exception to the 
conclusion we previously arrived at that the processes 
even of deductive sciences are altogether inductive 
and that their first principles are generalisations from 
experience it remains to be examined whether this 



preneral properties or its axioms to be of necessity inductively con 
cluded from the consideration of particular cases and surely this 
is the way in which children do acquire their knowledge of number 
and in which they learn its axioms the apples and the marbles 
are put in requisition and through the multitude of gingerbread 
nuts their ideas acquire cleaniess precision and generality

demonstration and necessary truths 

science resembles geometry in the further circum 
stance that some of its inductions are not exactly 
true and that the peculiar certainty ascribed to it 
on account of which its propositions are called neces 
sary truths is fictitious and hypothetical being true 
in no other sense than that those propositions neces 
sarily follow from the hypothesis of the truth of 
premisses which are avowedly mere approximations 
to truth 

 the inductions of arithmetic are of two sorts 
first those which we have just expounded such as 
one and one are two two and one are three c 
which may be called the definitions of the various 
numbers in the improper or geometrical sense of the 
word definition and secondly the two following 
axioms the sums of equals are equal the differ 
ences of equals are equal these two are sufficient 
for the corresponding propositions respecting imequals 
may be proved from these by the process well known 
to mathematicians under the name of reductio ad 
absurdum 

these axioms and likewise the socalled defini 
tions are as already shown results of induction true 
of all objects whatever and as it may seem exactly 
true without any hypothetical assumption of unquali 
fied truth where an approximation to it is all that 
exists the conclusions therefore it will naturally 
be inferred are exactly true and the science of 
nimiber is an exception to other demonstrative sci 
ences in this that the absolute certainty which is 
predicable of its demonstrations is independent of all 
hypothesis 

on more accurate investigation however it will 
be found that even in this casfe there is one hjrpo 
vol i digitized google 



 reasoning 

thetical element in the ratiocination in all proposi 
tions concerning numbers a condition is implied 
without which none of them would be true and that 
condition is an assumption which may be false the 
condition is that that all the numbers are 
numbers of the same or of equal units let this be 
doubtful and not one of the propositions of arithmetic 
will hold true how can we know that one pound 
and one pound make two pounds if one of the pounds 
may be troy and the other avoirdupois they may 
not make two pounds of either or of any weight 
how can we know that a fortyhorse power is always 
equal to itself unless we assimie that all horses are of 
equal strength it is certain that is always equal 
in number to and where the mere number of 
objects or of the parts of an object without suppos 
ing them to be equivalent in any other respect is all 
that is material the conclusions of arithmetic so far 
as they go to that alone are true without mixture of 
hjrpothesis there are a few suph cases as for 
instance an inquiry into the amoimt of population of 
any country it is indifferent to that inquiry whether 
they are grown people or children strong or weak 
tall or short the only thing we want to ascertain is 
their number but whenever from equality or ine 
quality of number equality or inequality in any other 
respect is to be inferred arithmetic carried into such 
inquiries becomes as hypothetical a science as geo 
metry all units must be assumed to be equal in 
that other respect and this is never precisely true 
for one pound weight is not exactly equal to anodier 
nor one miles length to another a nicer balance or 
more accimtte measuring instruments would always 
detect some difference 

what is commonly called mathematical certainty

demonstration and necessary truths 

therefore which comprises the twofold conception of 
unconditional truth and perfect accuracy is not an 
attribute of all mathematical truths but of those only 
which relate to pure number as distinguished from 
quantity in the more enlarged sense and only so long 
as we abstain from supposing that the numbers are a 
precise index to actual quantities the certainty 
usually ascribed to the conclasions of geometry and 
even to those of mechanics is nothing whatever but 
certainty of inference we can have full assurance 
of particular results under particular suppositions but 
we can not have the same assurance that these sup 
positions are accurately true nor that they include 
all the data which may exercise an influence over the 
result in any given instance 

§ it appears therefore that the method of all 
deductive sciences is hypothetical they proceed by 
tracing the consequences of certain assumptions 
leaving for separate consideration whether the assump 
tions are true or not and if not exactly true whether 
they are a sufficiently near approximation to the truth 
the reason is obvious since it is only in questions 
of pure number that the assumptions are exactly true 
and even there only so long as no conclusions except 
purely numerical ones are to be foimded upon them 
it must in all other cases of deductive investigation 
form a part of the inquiry to determine how much 
the assumptions want of being exactly true in the case 
in hand this is generally a matter of observation 
to be repeated in every fresh case or if it has to be 
settled by argument instead of observation may 
require in every diffisrent case difierent evidence and 
present every degree of difficulty from the lowest to 
the highest but the other part of the process —

 reasoning 

namely to determine what else may be concluded if 
we find and in proportion as we find the assumptions 
to be true — may be performed once for all and the 
results held ready to be employed as the occasions 
turn up for use we thus do all beforehand that can 
be so done and leave the least possible work to be 
performed when cases arise and press for a decision 
this inquiry into the inferences which can be drawn 
from assumptions is what properly constitutes demon 
strative science 

it is of course quite as practicable to arrive at 
new conclusions from facts assumed as from facts 
observed from fictitious as from real inductions 
deduction as we have seen consists of a series of 
inferences in this form a is a mark of of c c of 
d therefore a is a mark of d which last may be a 
truth inaccessible to direct observation in like man 
ner it is allowable to say suppose that a were a mark 
of b of c and c of d a would be a mark of d which 
last conclusion was not thought of by those who laid 
down the premisses a system of propositions as 
complicated as geometry might be deduced from 
assumptions which are false as was done by ptolemy 
descartes and others in their attempts to explain 
synthetically the phenomena of the solar system on 
the supposition that the apparent motions of the 
heavenly bodies were the real motions or were pro 
duced in some way more or less different from the 
true one sometimes the same thing is knowingly 
done for the purpose of showing the falsity of the 
assumption which is called a reductio ad absurdum 
in such cases the reasoning is as follows a is a mark 
of and of c now if c were also a mark of d a would 
be a mark of d but d is known to be a mark of the 
absence of a consequently a would be a mark of its

own absence which is a contradiction therefore c is 
not a mark of d 

 it has even been held by some philosophers 
that all ratiocination rests in the last resort upon a 
reductio ad absurdum since the way to enforce assent 
to it in case of obscurity would be to show that if 
the conclusion be denied we must deny some one at 
least of the premisses which as they are all supposed 
true would be a contradiction and in accordance 
with this many have thought that the peculiar nature 
of the evidence of ratiocination consisted in the impos 
sibility of admitting the premisses aud rejecting the 
conclusion without a contradiction in terms this 
theory however is quite inadmissible as an explana 
tion of the groimds on which ratiocination itself rests 
if any one denies the conclusion notwithstanding his 
admission of the premisses he is not involved in any 
direct and express contradiction until he is compelled 
to deny some premiss and he can only be forced to 
do this by a reductio ad abaurdum that is by another 
ratiocination now if he denies the validity of the 
reasoning process itself he can no more be forced to 
assent to the second syllogism than to the first in 
truth therefore no one is ever forced to a contradic 
tion in terms he can only be forced to a contradic 
tion or rather an infringement of the fundamental 
maxim of ratiocination namely that whatever has a 
mark has what it is a mark of or in the case of 
universal propositions that whatever is a mark of 
a thing is a mark of whatever else that thing is a 
mark of for in the case of every correct argument 
as soon as thrown into the syllogistic form it is 
evident without the aid of any other syllogism that 
he who admitting the premisses fails to draw

the conclusion does not conform to the above 
axiom 

without attaching exaggerated importance to the 
distinction now drawn i think it enables us to charac 
terise in a more accurate manner than is usually done 
the nature of demonstrative evidence and of logical 
necessity that is necessary from which to withhold 
our assent would be to violate the above axiom and 
since the axiom can only be violated by assenting to 
premisses and rejecting a legitimate conclusion from 
them nothing is necessary except the connexion 
between a conclusion and premisses ofwhidi doc 
trine the whole of this and the preceding chapter are 
submitted as the proof 

we have now proceeded as far in the theory 
of deduction as we can advance in the present stage 
of our inquiry any fturthcr insight into the subject 
requires that the foundation shall have been laid of 
the philosophic theory of induction itself in which 
theory that of deduction as a mode of induction 
which we have now shown it to be will assume 
spontaneously the place which belongs to it and will 
receive its share of whatever light may be thrown

chapter i 

preliminary observations on induction 
in general 

 the portion ofthe present inquiry upon which 
we are now about to enter may be considered as the 
principal both from its surpassing in intricacy all the 
other branches and because it relates to a process 
which has been shown in the preceding book to be 
that in which the investigation of nature essentially 
consists we have found that all inference conse 
quently all proof and all discovery of truths not self 
evident consists of inductions and the interpretation 
of inductions that all our knowledge not intuitive 
comes to us exclusively from that source what 
induction is therefore and what conditions render it 
legitimate cannot but be deemed the main question 
of the science of logic — the question which includes 
all others it is however one which professed 
writers on logic have almost entirely passed over 
the generalities of the subject have not been alto 
gether neglected by metaphysicians but for want of 
sufficient acquaintance with the processes by which 
science has actually succeeded in establishing general 
truths their analysis of the inductive operation even 
when unexceptionable as to correctness has not been 
specific enough to be made the foundation of practical 
rales which might be for induction itself what the 
rules of the syllogism are for the interpretation of 
induction while those by whom physical science has 
been carried to its present high state of improvement— 
and who to arrive at a complete theory of the process

 induction 

needed only to generalize and adapt to all varieties 
of problems the methods which they themselves 
employed in their habitual pursuits — never until very 
lately made any serious attempt to philosophize on 
the subject nor regarded the mode in which they 
arrived at their conclusions as deserving of study 
independently of the conclusions themselves 

although for these reasons there is not yet 
extant a body of inductive logic scientifically con 
structed the materials for its construction exist 
widely scattered but abundant and the selection and 
arrangement of those materials is a task with which 
intellects of the highest order possessed of the 
necessary acquirements have at length consented to 
occupy themselves within a few years three writers 
profoundly versed in every branch of physical science 
and not unaccustomed to carry their speculations into 
still higher regions of knowledge have made attempts 
of unequal but all of very great merit towards the 
creation of a philosophy of induction sir john 
herschel in his discourse on the study of natural 
philosophy mr whewell in his history and philo 
sophy of the inductive sciences and greatest of all 
m auguste comte in his cours de philosophic 
positive a work which only requires to be better 
known to place its author in the very highest class 
of european thinkers that the present writer does 
not consider any of these philosophers or even all of 
them together to have entirely accomplished this 
important work is implied in his attempting to contri 
bute something farther towards its achievement but 
with his comparatively imperfect knowledge of the 
various physical sciences the attempt would have 
been desperate unless the materials had been brought 
together and had undergone a partial elaboration by

their more competent hands even if he could have 
dispensed with the many important logical ideas and 
principles for the first suggestion of which he has been 
indebted to one or other of those writers 

§ for the purposes of the present inquiry 
induction may be defined the operation of discovering 
and proving general propositions it is true that as 
already shown the process of indirectly ascertaining 
individual facts is as truly inductive as that by which 
we establish general truths but it is not a different 
kind of induction it is another form of the very same 
process since on the one hand generals are but 
collection of particulars definite in kind but inde 
finite in number and on the other hand whenever 
the evidence which we derive from observation of 
known cases justifies us in drawing an inference 
respecting even one unknown case we should on 
the same evidence be justified in drawing a similar 
inference with respect to a whole class of cases the 
inference either does not hold at all or it holds in all 
cases of a certain description in all cases which in 
certain definable respects resemble those we have 
obseitcd 

if these remarks are just if the principles and 
rules of inference are the same whether we infer 
general propositions or individual facts it follows 
that a complete logic of the sciences would be also a 
complete logic of practical business and common 
life since there is no case of legitimate inference 
from experience in which the conclusion may not 
legitimately be a general proposition an analysis 
of the process by which general truths are arrived 
at is virtually an analysis of all induction whatever 
whether we are inquiring into a scientific principle 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

or into an individual fact and whether we proceed 
by experiment or by ratiocination every step in the 
train of inferences is essentially inductive and the 
legitimacy of the induction depends in both cases 
upon the same conditions 

true it is that in the case of the practical inquirer 
who is endeavouring to ascertain facts not for the 
purposes of science but for those of business such 
for instance as the advocate or the judge the chief 
difficulty is one in which the principles of induction 
will afford him no assistance it lies not in making 
his inductions but in the selection of them in 
choosing from among all general propositions ascer 
tained to be true those which furnish him with marks 
by which he may trace whether the given subject 
possesses or not the predicate in question in arguing 
a doubtful question of fact before a jury the general 
propositions or principles to which the advocate 
appeals are mostly in themselves sufficiently trite 
and assented to as soon as stated his skill lies in 
bringing his case under those propositions or prin 
ciples in calling to mind such of the known or 
recognised maxims of probability as admit of appli 
cation to the case in hand and selecting from among 
them those best adapted to his object success is here 
dependent upon natural or acquired sagacity aided 
by knowledge of the particular subject and of subjects 
allied with it invention though it can be cultivated 
cannot be reduced to rule there is no science which 
will enable a man to bethink himself of that which 
will suit his purpose 

but when he his thought of something science 
can tell him whether that which he has thought of 
will suit his purpose or not the inquirer or arguer 
must be guided by his own knowledge and sagacity 

digitized by vjooq ic 



induction in general 

in his choice of the inductions out of which he will 
construct his argument but the validity of the 
argument when constructed depends upon principles 
and must be tried by tests which are the same for all 
descriptions of inquiries whether the result be to give 
a an estate or to enrich science with a new general 
truth in the one case and in the other the senses 
or testimony must decide on the individual facts 
the rules of the syllogism will determine whether 
those facts being supposed correct the case really 
falls within the formulae of the different inductions 
under which it has been successively brought and 
finally ihie legitimacy of the inductions themselves 
must be decided by other rules and these it is now 
our purpose to investigate if this third part of the 
operation be in many of the questions of practical 
life not the most but the least arduous portion of it 
we have seen that this is also the case in some great 
departments of the field of science in all those 
which are principally deductive and most of all in 
mathematics where the inductions themselves are few 
in number and so obvious and elementary that they 
seem to stand in no need of the evidence of expe 
rience while to combine them so as to prove a given 
theorem or solve a problem may call for the highest 
powers of invention and contrivance with which our 
species is gifted 

if the identity of the logical processes which prove 
particular facts and those which establish general 
scientific truths required any additional confirmation 
it would be sufficient to consider that in many 
branches of science single facts have to be proved as 
well as principles facts as completely individual as 
any that are debated in a court of justice but which 
are proved in the same manner as the other truths of

 induction 

the science and without disturbing in any degree the 
homogeneity of its method a remarkable example 
of this is afforded by astronomy the individual facts 
upon which that science grounds its most important 
deductions such facts as the magnitudes of the bodies 
of the solar system their distances from one another 
the figure of the earth and its rotation are scarcely 
any of them accessible to our means of direct obser 
vation they are proved indirectly by the aid of 
inductions founded on other facts which we can more 
easily reach for example the distance of the moon 
from the earth was determined by a very circuitous 
process the share which direct observation had in 
the work consisted in ascertaining at one and the 
same instant the zenith distances of the moon as 
seen from two points very remote from one another 
on the earths surface the ascertainment of these 
angular distances ascertained their supplements and 
since the angle at the earths centre subtended by the 
distance between the two places of observation was 
deduciwe by spherical trigonometry from the latitude 
and longitude of those places the angle at the moon 
subtended by the same line became the fourth angle 
of a quadrilateral of which the other three angles 
were known the four angles being thus ascertained 
and two sides of the quadrilateral being radii of the 
earth the two remaining sides and the diagonal or in 
other words the moons distance from the two places 
of observation and from the centre of the earth 
could be ascertained at least in terms of the earths 
radius from elementary theorems of geometry at 
each step in this demonstration we take in a new 
induction represented in the aggregate of its results 
by a general proposition 

not only is the process by which an individual

induction in general 

astronomical fact was thus ascertained exactly similar 
to those by which the same science establishes its 
general truths but moreover as we have shown to 
be the case in all legitimate reasoning a general pro 
position might have been concluded instead of a single 
fact in strictness indeed the result of the reason 
ing is a general proposition a theorem respecting 
the distance not of the moon in particular but of any 
inaccessible object showing in what relation that 
distance stands to certain other quantities and 
although the moon is almost the only heavenly body 
the distance of which from the earth can really be 
thus ascertained this is merely owing to the acci 
dental circumstances of the other heavenly bodies 
which render them incapable of affording such data 
as the application of the theorem requires for the 
theorem itself is as true of them as it is of the 
moon 

we shall fall into no error then if in treating of 
induction we limit our attention to the establishment 
of general propositions the principles and rules of 
induction as directed to this end are the principles 
and rules of all induction and the logic of science 
is the universal logic applicable to all inquiries in 
which man can engage and the test of all the conclu 
sions at which he can arrive by inference

chapter il 
op inductions improperly so called 

 induction then is that operation of the 
mind by which we infer that what we know to be 
true in a particular case or cases will be true in all 
cases which resemble the former in certain assignable 
respects in other words induction is the process 
by which we conclude that what is true of certain 
individuals of a class is true of the whole class or 
that what is true at certain times will be true under 
similar circumstances at all times 

this definition excludes from the meaning of the 
term induction various logical operations to which 
it is not unusual to apply that name 

induction as above defined is a process of infe 
rence it proceeds from the known to the unknown 
and any operation involving no inference any process 
in which what seems the conclusion is no wider 
than the premisses from which it is drawn does not 
fall within the meaning of the term yet in the 
common books of logic we find this laid down as the 
most perfect indeed the only quite perfect form of 
induction in those books every process which sets 
out from a less general and terminates in a more 
general expression — which admits of being stated in 
the form this and that a are b therefore every a 
is b — is called an induction whether anything be 
really concluded or not and the induction is asserted 
to be not perfect unless every single individual of the 
class a is included in the antecedent or premiss 
that is unless what we aflirm of the class has already

been ascertained to be true of every individual in it 
so that the nominal conclusion is not really a conclu 
sion but a mere reassertion of the premisses if we 
were to say all the planets shine by the suns light 
from observation of each separate planet or all the 
apostles were jews because this is true of peter 
paul john and every other apostle — these and such 
as these would in the phraseology in question be 
called perfect and the only perfect inductions this 
however is a totally different kind of induction from 
ours it is no inference from facts known to facts 
unknown but a mere shorthand registration of facts 
known the two simulated arguments which we have 
quoted are not generalizations the propositions pur 
porting to be conclusions from them are not really 
general propositions a general proposition is one in 
which the predicate is affirmed or denied of an unlimited 
number of individuals namely all whether few or 
many existing or capable of existing which possess the 
properties connoted by the subject of the proposition 
 all men are mortal does not mean all now living 
but all men past present and to come when the 
signification of the term is limited so as to render 
it a name not for any and every individual falling 
imder a certain general description but only for each 
of a number of individuals designated as such and as it 
were coimted off individually the proposition though 
it may be general in its language is no general pro 
position but merely that number of singular proposi 
tions written in an abridged character the opera 
tion may be very useful as most forms of abridged 
notation are but it is no part of the investigation of 
truth though often bearing an important part in the 
preparation of the materials for that investigation

 induction 

§ a second process which requires to be distin 
guished from induction is one to which mathemati 
cians sometimes give that name and which so far resem 
bles induction properly so called that the propositions it 
leads to are really general propositions for example 
when we have proved with respect to the circle that 
a straight une cannot meet it in more than two points 
and when the same thing has been successively proved 
of the ellipse the parabola and the hyperbola it may 
be laid down as an universal property of the sections 
of the cone in this example there is no induction 
because there is no inference the conclusion is a 
mere summing up of what was asserted in the various 
propositions from which it is drawn a case some 
what though not altogether similar is the proof of a 
geometrical theorem by means of a diagram whether 
the diagram be on paper or only in the imagination 
the demonstration as we formerly observed does 
not prove directly the general theorem it proves only 
that the conclusion which the theorem asserts gene 
rally is true of the particular triangle or circle exhi 
bited in the diagram but since we perceive that in 
the same way in which we have proved it of that 
circle it might also be proved of any other circle we 
gather up into one general expression all the singular 
propositions susceptible of being thus proved and 
embody them in an universal proposition having 
shown that the three angles of the triangle abc 
are together equal to two right angles we conclude 
that this is true of every other triangle not because 
it is true of a b c but for the same reason which 
proved it to be true of abc if this were to be

called induction an appropriate name for it would be 
induction by parity of reasoning but the term can 
not properly belong to it the characteristic quality 
of induction is wanting since the truth obtained 
though really general is not beueved on the evidence 
of particular instances we do not conclude that all 
triangles have the property because some triangles 
have but from the ulterior demonstrative evidence 
which was the ground of our conviction in the parti 
cular instances 

there are nevertheless in mathematics some 
examples of socalled induction in which the conclu 
sion does bear the appearance of a generalization 
grounded upon some of the particular cases included 
in it a mathematician when he has calculated a 
sufficient number of the terms of an algebraical or 
arithmetical series to have ascertained what is called 
the law of the series does not hesitate to fill up any 
number of the succeeding terms without repeating 
the calculations but i apprehend he only does so 
when it is apparent from d priori considerations 
which might be exhibited in the form of demonstra 
tion that the mode of formation of the subsequent 
terms each from that which preceded it must be 
similar to the formation of the terms which have been 
already calculated and when the attempt has been 
hazarded without the sanction of such general con 
siderations there are instances upon record in which 
it has led to false results 
r it is said that newton discovered the binomial 
 theorem by induction by raising a binomial succes 
sively to a certain number of powers and comparing 
those powers with one another until he detected the 
relation in which the algebraic formula of each power 
stands to the exponent of that power and to the two

terms of the binomial the feet is not improbable 
but a mind like newtons which seemed to arrive 
per saltum at principles and conclusions that ordinary 
mathematicians only reached by a succession of steps 
certainly could not have performed the comparison in 
question without being led by it to the a priori ground 
of the law since any one who understands suflbciently 
the nature of multiplication to venture upon multi 
plying several lines of figures or symbols at one 
operation cannot but perceive that in raising a bino 
mial to a power the coefficients must depend upon 
the laws of permutation and combination and as 
soon as this is recognised the theorem is demon 
strated indeed when once it was seen that the law 
prevailed in a few of the lower powers its identity 
with the law of permutation would at once suggest 
the considerations which prove it to obtain universally 
even therefore such cases as these are but examples 
of what i have called induction by parity of reasoning 
that is not really induction because not involving 
any inference of a general proposition from particular 
instances 

 there remains a third improper use of the 
term induction which it is of real importance to clear 
up because the theory of induction has been to no 
ordinary degree confused by it and because the con 
fusion is exemplified in the most recent and most 
elaborate treatise on the inductive philosophy which 
exists in our language the error in question is that

completely round it he then pronounces it an island

tion at which he could perceive that this land was 
entirely surrounded by water he ascertained the feet 
by a succession of partial observations and then 
selected a general expression which summed up in 
two or three words the whole of what he so observed

this process did he infer anything that had not 
been observed from something else which had

navigator saw in the course of his circumnavigation

facts the description of a complex fact to which 
those simpler ones are as the parts of a whole

 induction 

it was not more an inductive act than that of our 
supposed navigator 

the object of kepler was to determine the real 
path described by each of the planets or let us say 
the planet mars for it was of that body that he first 
estabushed two of the three great astronomical truths 
which bear his name to do this there was no other 
mode than that of direct observation and all which 
observation could do was to ascertain a great number 
of the successive places of the planet or rather of 
its apparent places that the planet occupied succes 
sively all these positions or at all events positions 
which produced the same impressions on the eye and 
that it passed from one of these to another insensibly 
and without any apparent breach of continuity thus 
much the senses with the aid of the proper instru 
ments could ascertain what kepler did more than 
this was to find what sort of a curve these difierent 
points would make supposing them to be all joined 
together he expressed the whole series of the 
observed places of mars by what mr whewell calls 
the general conception of an ellipse this operation 
was far from being as easy as that of the navigator 
who expressed the series of his observations on suc 
cessive points of the coast by the general conception 
of an island but it is the very same sort of opera 
tion and if the one is not an induction but a descrip 
tion this must also be true of the other 

to avoid misapprehension we must remark that 
kepler in one respect performed a real act of induc 
tion namely in concluding that because the observed 
places of mars were correctly represented by points 
in an imaginary ellipse therefore mars would con 
tinue to revolve in that same elhpse and even in

concluding that the position of the planet during the 
time which intervened between two observations must 
have coincided with the intermediate pomts of the 
curve but this really inductive operation requires 
to be carefully distinguished from the mere act of 
bringing the facts actually observed under a general 
description so distinct are these two operations 
that the one might have been performed without the 
other men might and did make correct inductions 
concerning the heavenly motions before they had 
obtained correct general descriptions of them it 
was known that the planets always moved in the 
same paths long before it had been ascertained that 
those paths were ellipses men early remarked 
that the same set of apparent positions returned peri 
odically when they obtained a new description of 
the phenomenon they did not necessarily make any 
further induction nor which is the true test of a 
new general truth add anything to the power of 
prediction which they already possessed 

 the descriptive operation which enables a 
number of details to be summed up in a single propo 
sition mr whewell by an aptlychosen expression 
has termed the colligation of facts in most of his 
observations concerning that mental process i fully 
agree and would gladly transfer all that portion of 
his book into my own pages i only think him mis 
taken in setting up this kind of operation which 
according to the old and received meaning of the term 
is not induction at all as the type of induction gene 
rally and laying down throughout his work as prin 
ciples of induction the principles of mere colligation

mr whewell maintains that the general propo 
sition which binds together the particular facts and 
makes them as it were one fact is not the mere 
sum of those facts but something more since 
there is introduced a conception of the mind which 
did not exist in the facts themselves the par 
ticular facts says he are not merely brought 
together but there is a new element added to 
the combination by the very act of thought by 
which they are combined when the greeks 
after long observing the motions of the planets saw 
that these motions might be rightly considered as 
produced by the motion of one wheel revolving in 
the inside of another wheel these wheels were crea 
tions of their minds added to the facts which they 
perceived by sense and even if the wheels were no 
longer supposed to be material but were reduced to 
mere geometrical spheres or circles they were not the 
less products of the mind alone — something addi 
tional to the facts observed the same is the case in 
all other discoveries the facts are known but they 
are insulated and unconnected till the discoverer 
suppues from his own store a principle of connexion 
the pearls are there but they will not hang together 
till some one provides the string 

that a conception of the mind is introduced is 
indeed most certain and mr whewell has rightly 
stated elsewhere that to hit upon the right conception 
is often a far more difficult and more meritorious 
achievement than to prove its applicability when 
obtained but a conception implies and corresponds 
to something conceived and although the conception 



phu ind sciences ii 

digitized by vjooq ic 



inductions improperly so called 

itself is dot in the facts but in our mind it must be a 
conception of something which really is in the facts 
some property which they actually possess and which 
they would manifest to our senses if our senses were 
able to take cognizance of them if for instance 
the planet left behind it in space a visible track and 
if the observer were in a fixed position at such a 
distance above the plane of the orbit as would enable 
him to see the whole of it at once he would see it to 
be an ellipse and if gifted with appropriate instru 
ments and powers of locomotion he could prove it to 
be such by measuring its diflferent dimensions these 
things are indeed impossible to us but not impossible 
in themselves if they were so keplers law could 
not be true 

subject to the indispensable condition which has 
just been stated i cannot perceive that the part which 
conceptions have in the operation of studying facts 
has ever been overlooked or undervalued as mr 
whewell supposes it has no one ever disputed 
that in order to reason about anything we must have 
a conception of it or that when we include a multi 
tude of things under a general expression there is 
implied in the expression a conception of something 
common to those things but it by no means follows 
that the conception is necessarily preexistent or 
constructed by the mind out of its own materials 
if the facts are rightly classed under the conception it 
is because there is in the facts themselves something 
of which the conception is itself a copy and which 
if we cannot directly perceive it is because of the 
limited power of our organs and not because the 
thing itself is not there the conception itself is 
often obtained by abstraction from the very facts 
which in mr whewells language it is afterwards

called in to connect this mr whewell himself 
admits when he observes which he does on several 
occasions how great a service would be rendered to 
the science of physiology by the philosopher who 
should establish a precise tenable and consistent 
conception of life such a conception can only be 
abstracted from the phenomena of life itself from the 
very facts which it is put in requisition to connect 
in other cases no doubt instead of collecting the 
conception from the very phenomena which we are 
attempting to colhgate we select it from among those 
which have been previously collected by abstraction 
from other facts in the instance of keplers laws the 
latter was the case the facts being out of the reach 
of being observed in any such manner as would have 
enabled the senses to identify directly the path of the 
planet the conception requisite for framing a general 
description of that path could not be collected by 
abstraction from the observations themselves the 
mind had to supply hypothetically from among the 
conceptions it had obtained from other portions of its 
experience some one which would correctly represent 
the series of the observed facts it had to frame a 
supposition respecting the general course of the 
phenomenon and ask itself if this be the general 
description what will the details be and then com 
pare these with the details actually observed if they 
agreed the hypothesis would serve for a description 
of the phenomenon if not it was necessarily aban 
doned and another tried it is such a case as this 
which gives colour to the doctrine that the mind in 
framing the descriptions adds something of its own 
which it does not find in the facts

yet it is a fact surely that the planet does 
describe an ellipse and a fact which we could see if 
we had adequate visual organs and a suitable position 
not having these advantages but possessing the 
conception of an elupse or to express the meaning 
in less technical language knowing what an ellipse 
was kepler tried whether the observed places of the 
planet were consistent with such a path he found 
they were so and he consequently asserted as a fact 
that the planet moved in an ellipse but this fact 
which kepler did not add to but found in the 
motions of the planet namely that it occupied in 
succession the various points in the circumference of 
a given ellipse was the very fact the separate parts 
of which had been separately observed it was the 
sum of the different observations it superadded 
nothing to the particular facts which it served to bind 
together except indeed the knowledge that a rem 
blance existed between the planetary orbit and other 
ellipses an accession the nature and amount of 
which will be fully considered hereafter 

having stated this fundamental difference between 
my views and those of mr whewell i must add that 
his account of the manner in which a conception is 
selected suitable to fexpress the facts appears to me 
perfectly just the experience of all thinkers will i 
believe testify that the process is tentative that it con 
sists of a succession of guesses many being rejected 
until one at last occurs fit to be chosen we know 
from kepler himself that before hitting upon the con 
ception of an ellipse he tried nineteen other imagi 
nary paths which finding them inconsistent with the 
observations he was obuged to reject but as mr

whewell truly says the successful hypothesis although 
a guess ought not to be called a lucky but a skilful 
guess the guesses which serve to give mental imity 
and wholeness to a chaos of scattered particulars are 
accidents which occur to no minds but those abound 
ing in knowledge and disciplined in scientific combi 
nations 

how far this tentative method so indispensable as 
a means to the colligation of facts for purposes of 
description admits of application to induction itself 
and what functions belong to it in that department 
will be considered in the chapter of the present book 
which relates to hrpotheses on the present occasion 
we have chiefly to distinguish this process of colliga 
tion from induction properly so called and that the 
distinction may be made clearer it is well to advert to 
a curious and interesting remark of mr whewell 
which is as strikingly true of the former operation as 
it is unequivocally false of the latter 

in different stages of the progress of knowledge 
philosophers have employed for the colligation of the 
same order of facts different conceptions ttie early 
and rude observations of the heavenly bodies in which 
minute precision was neither attained nor sought 
presented nothing inconsistent with the representation 
of the path of a planet as an exact circle having the 
earth for its centre as observations increased in 
accuracy and facts were disclosed which were not 
reconcileable with this simple supposition for the 
colugation of those additional facts the supposition 
was varied and varied again and again as facts 
became more numerous and precise the earth was 
removed from the centre to some other point within 
the circle the planet was supposed to revolve in a 
smaller circle called an epicycle round an imaginary

inductions improperly so called 

point which revolved in a circle round the earth in 
proportion as observation elicited fresh facts contra 
dictory to these representations other epicycles and 
other excentrics were added producing additional 
complication until at last kepler swept all these 
circles away and substituted the conception of an 
exact ellipse even this is found not to represent 
with complete correctness the accurate observations 
of the present day which disclose many slight devia 
tions from an orbit exactly elliptical now mr 
wheweu has remarked that these successive general 
expressions though apparently so conflicting were 
all correct they all answered the purpose of colliga 
tion they all enabled the mind to represent to itself 
with feciuty and by a simultaneous glance the whole 
body of facts at that time ascertained each in its turn 
served as a correct description of the phenomena so 
far as the senses had up to that time taken cognizance 
of them if a necessity afterwards arose for discarding 
one of these general descriptions of the planets orbits 
and framing a different imaginary line by which to 
express the series of observed positions it was 
because a number of new facts had now been added 
which it was neccessary to combine with the old facts 
into one general description but this did not affect 
the correctness of the former expression considered 
as a general statement of the only facts which it was 
intended to represent and so true is this that as is 
well remarked by m comte these ancient generali 
zations even the rudest and most imperfect of them 
that of uniform movement in a circle are so far from 
being entirely false that they are even now habitually 
employed by astronomers when only a rough approxi 
mation to correctness is required lastronomie

mr whewdfs remark therefore is as just as it 
is interesting successive expressions for the colli 
gation of observed facts or in other words successive 
descriptions of a phenomenon as a whole which has 
been observed only in parts may though conflicting 
be all correct as far as they go but it would surely 
be absurd to assert this of conflicting inductions 

the philosophic study of facts may be undertaken 
for three different purposes the simple description of 
the facts their explanation or their prediction 
meaning by prediction the determination of the 
conditions under which similar facts may be expected 
again to occur to the first of these three operations 
the name of induction does not properly belong to 
the other two it does now mr whewells observa 
tion is true of the first alone considered as a mere 
description the circular theory of the heavenly 
motions represents perfectly well their general fea 
tures and by adding epicycles without limit those 
motions even as now known to us might be 
expressed with any degree of accuracy that might be 
required the only real advantage of the elliptical 
theory as a mere description would be its simplicity

and the consequent facility of conceiving it and 
reasoning about it for it would not really be more 
true than the other different descriptions there 
fore may be all true but not surely different 
explanations the doctrine that the heavenly bodies 
moved by a virtue inherent in their celestial nature 
the doctrine that they were moved by impact wliich 
led to the hypothesis of vortices as the only impelling 
force capable of whirling bodies in circles and the 
newtonian doctrine that they are moved by the 
composition of a centripetal with an original projec 
tile force all these are explanations collected by 
real induction from supposed parallel cases and they 
were all successively received by philosophers as 
scientific truths on the subject of the heavenly bodies 
can it be said of these as we said of the different 
descriptions that they are all true as far as they go 
is it not clear that one only can be true in any 
degree and the other two must be altogether false 
so much for explanations let us now compare dif 
ferent predictions the first that eclipses will occur 
whenever one planet or sateuite is so situated as to 
cast its shadow upon another the second that they 
will occur whenever some great calamity is impending 
over mankind do these two doctrines only differ in 
the degree of their truth as expressing real facts 
with imequal degrees of accuracy assuredly the 
one is true and the other absolutely false 

in every way therefore it is evident that when 
mr whewell explains induction as the colligation of 
facts by means of appropriate conceptions that is 
conceptions which will really express them he con 
founds mere description of the observed facts with 
inference from those facts and ascribes to the latter 
what is a characteristic property of the former 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

there is however between colligation and induc 
tion a real correlation which it is important to con 
ceive correctly colligation is not always induction 
but induction is always colligation the assertion 
that the planets move in ellipses was but a mode of 
representing observed facts it was but a colligation 
while the assertion that they are drawn or tend 
towards the sun was the statement of a new fact 
inferred by induction but the induction once made 
accompushes the purposes of colligation likewise 
it brings the same facts which kepler had connected 
by his conception of an ellipse under the additional 
conception of bodies acted upon by a central force 
and serves therefore as a new bond of connexion for 
those facts a new principle for their classification 

moreover that general description which is 
improperly confoimded with induction is neverthe 
less a necessary preparation for induction no less 
necessary than correct observation of the facts them 
selves without the previous colligation of detached 
observations by means of one general conception we 
could never have obtained any basis for an induction 
except in the case of phenomena of very limited 
compass we should not be able to affirm any 
predicates at all of a subject incapable of being 
observed otherwise than piecemeal much less could 
we extend those predicates by induction to other 
similar subjects induction therefore always pre 
supposes not only that the necessary observations are 
made with the necessary accuracy but also that the 
results of these observations are so far as practicable 
connected together by general descriptions enabling 
the mind to represent to itself as wholes whatever 
phenomena are capable of being so represented

required from the conception than that it shall serve 
to connect the observations would be to substitute 
hypothesis for theory and imagination for proof the 
connecting link must be some character which reculy 
exists in the facts themselves and which would 
manifest itself therein if the conditions could be 
realized which our organs of sense require

colligation or of tjhe correlative expression invented

chapter iii 
of the ground of induction 

 induction properly so called as distin 
guished from those mental operations sometimes 
thou improperiy designated by the name which i 
have attempted in the preceding chapter to charac 
terise may then be summarily defined as oeneraliza 
tion from experience it consists in inferring fihm 
some individual instances in which a phenomenon is 
observed to occur that it occurs in all instances of 
a certain class namely in all which resemble the 
former in what are regarded as the material circum 
stances 

in what way the material circumstances are to be 
distinguished from those which are immaterial or 
why some of the circumstances are material and 
others not so we are not yet ready to point out we 
must first observe that there is a principle implied in 
the very statement of what induction is an assump 
tion with regard to the course of nature and the 
order of the universe namely that there are such 
things in nature as parallel cases that what happens 
once will under a sufficient degree of similarity of 
circumstances happen again and not only again but 
always this i say is an assumption involved in 
every case of induction and if we consult the actual 
course of nature we find that the assumption is 
warranted the fact is so the imiverse we find is 
so constituted that whatever is true in any one case 
is true in all cases of a certain description the only 
difficiilty is to find what description

ground or induction 

this universal fact which is our warrant for all 
inference from experience has been described by dif 
ferent philosophers in different forms of language 
that the course of nature is uniform that the universe 
is governed by general laws and the like one of 
the most usual of these modes of expression but also 
one of the most inadequate is that which has been 
brought into familiar use by the metaphysicians of the 
school of reid and stewart the disposition of the 
human mind to generalize from experience — a pro 
pensity considered by these philosophers as an idstinct 
of our nature — they usually describe under the name 
of our intuitive conviction that the future will re 
semble the past now it has been well pointed 
out by mr bailejr that whether the tendency be 
or not an original and ultimate element of our 
nature time in its modifications of past present 
and future has no concern either with the belief itself 
or with the grounds of it we believe that fire will 
bum tomorrow because it burned today and yester 
day but we believe on precisely the same grounds 
that it burned before we were bom and that it bums 
this very day in cochinchina it is not from the 
past to the future as past and future that we infer 
but from the known to the unknown from facts 
observed to facts unobserved from what we have 
perceived or been directly conscious of to what 
has not come within our experience in this last 
predicament is the whole region of the future but 
also the vastly greater portion of the present and of 
the past

 induction 

it the proposition that the course of nature is uniform 
is the fundamental principle or general axiom of 
induction it would yet be a great error to offer this 
large generalization as any explanation of the induc 
tive process on the contrary i hold it to be itself 
an instance of induction and induction by no means 
of the most obvious kind far from being the first 
induction we make it is one of the last or at all 
events one of those which are latest in attaining strict 
philosophical accuracy as a general maxim indeed 
it has scarcely entered into the minds of any but 
philosophers nor even by them as we shall have 
many opportunities of remarking have its extent and 
limits been always very justly conceived yet this 
principle though so far from being our earliest induc 
tion must be considered as our warrant for all the 
others in this sense that unless it were true all other 
inductions would be fallacious and this as we have 
already seen is the sole mode in which the general 
propositions which we place at the head of our rea 
sonings when we throw them into syllogisms ever 
really contribute to their validity archbishop 
whately has well remarked that every induction is 
a syllogism with the major premiss suppressed or 
as i prefer expressing it that every induction may 
be thrown into the form of a syllogism by supplying 
a major premiss if this be actually done the prin 
ciple which we are now considering that of the 
imiformity of the course of nature will appear as the 
ultimate major premiss of all inductions and will 
tlierefore stand to all inductions in the relation in 
which as has been shown at so much length the 
major proposition of a syllogism always stands to the 
conclusion not contributing at all to prove it but

being a necessary condition of its being proved since 
no conclusion is proved for which there cannot be 
found a true major premiss 



 from the foot that every induction may be expressed in the 
form of a syllogism archbishop whately concludes that induction 
itself is but a peculiar case of ratiocination and that the universal 
type of all inference or reasoning is the syllogism our own 
inquiries have led us to a directly opposite result instead of re 
solving induction into ratiocination it has appeared to us that 
ratiocination is itself resolvable into induction the archbishops 
theory may i think be shown to be fallacious by following out his 
own train of thought the induction john peter thomas c 
are mortal therefore all mankind are mortal may as he justly 
says be thrown into a syllogism by prefixing as a major premiss 
what is at any rate a necessary condition of the validity of the 
argument namely that whatever is true of john peter thomas 
c is true of all mankind so far the case is made out and arch 
bishop whately who endowed with a penetrating and active 
rather than a patient and persevering intellect seldom fails to cast 
his sounding line to a greater depth than his predecessors and when 
he has done this scarcely seems to care whether he reaches tho 
bottom or not omitted to ask himself the further question how 
we come by the major premiss it is not selfevident nay in all 
cases of unwarranted generalization it is not true how then is 
it arrived at necessarily either by induction or ratiocination 
and if by induction then on the archbbhops principles it is 
by ratiocination still that is by a previous syllogism this pre 
vious syllogism it is therefore necessary to construct there is in 
the long run only one possible construction the real proof that 
whatever is true of john peter c is true of all mankind can 
only be that a different supposition would be inconsistent with the 
uniformity which we know to exist in the course of nature 
whether there would be this inconsistency or not may be a matter 
of long and delicate inquiry but imless there would we have no 
sufficient ground for the major of the inductive syllogism it hence 
appears that if we throw the whole course of any inductive argu 
ment into a series of syllogisms we shall arrive by more or fewer 
steps at an ultimate syllogism which will have for its major premiss 
the principle or axiom of the uniformity of the course of nature 
having reached this point we have the whole field of induction

 induction 

it was not to be expected that in the case of this 
axiom any more than of other axioms there should 
be unanimity among philosophers with respect to the 
grounds upon which it is to be received as true i 
have already stated that i regard it as itself a genera 
lization from experience others hold it to be a 
principle which antecedently to any verification by 
experience we are compelled by the constitution of 
our thinking faculty to assume as true having so 
recently and at so much length combated a similar 
doctrine as apphed to the axioms of mathematics by 
arguments which are in a great measure applicable to 
the present case i shall defer the more particular 
discussion of this controverted point in regard to the 



laid out in syllogisms and every instance of inference from experi 
ence exhibited as the conclucdon of a ratiocination except one but 
that one unhappily includes all the rest whence came the 
universal major what proves to us that nature is governed by 
general laws where are the premisses of the syllogism of which 
that is the conclusion here at least is a case of induction which 
canuut be resolved into syllogism 

and undoubtedly it would be the ideal perfection of inductive 
philosophy if all other general truths could be exhibited as con 
clusions deduced from that widest generalization of all but such 
a mode of presenting them however useful in giving coherence and 
systematic unity to our thoughts would be an inversion of the real 
order of proof this great generalization must itself have been 
founded on prior generalizations the obscurer laws of nature were 
discovered by means of it but the more obvious ones must have 
been understood and assented to as general truths before it was ever 
heard of we should never have dared to affirm that all pheno 
mena take place according to general laws if we had not first arrived 
in the case of a great multitude of phenomena at some knowledge 
of the laws themselves which could be done no otherwise than by 
induction archbishop whatelys theory therefore implying as it 
does the consequence that we never could have had a single well 
grounded induction unless we had already reached that highest 
generalization must i conceive be regarded as untenable

ground of induction 

ftmdamental axiom of induction until a more ad 
vanced period of our inquiry at present it is of 
more importance to understand thoroughly the import 
of the axiom itself for the proposition that the 
course of nature is uniform possesses rather the 
brevity suitable to popular than the precision requi 
site in philosophical language its terms require to 
be explained and a stricter than their ordinary signi 
fication given to them before the truth of the asser 
tion can be admitted 

 every persons consciousness assures him 
that he does not always expect uniformity in the 
course of events he does not always believe that the 
unknown will be similar to the known that the 
future will resemble the past nobody believes that 
the succession of rain and fine weather will be the 
same in every future year as in the present nobody 
expects to have the same dreams repeated every 
night on the contrary everybody mentions it as 
something extraordinary if the course of nature is 
constant and resembles itself in these particulars 
to look for constancy where constancy is not to be 
expected as for instance that a day which has once 
brought good fortune will always be a fortunate day 
is justly accounted superstition 

the course of nature in truth is not only uni 
form it is also infinitely various some phenomena 
are always seen to recur in the very same combina 
tions in which we met with them at first others seem 
altogether capricious while some which we had been 
accustomed to regard as bound down exclusively to a 
particular set of combinations we imexpectedly find

according to the notion which the ancients enter 
tained of induction the foregoing were cases of as 
legitimate inference as any inductions whatever in 
these two instances in which the conclusion being 
false the ground of inference must have been insuffi 
cient there was nevertheless as much ground for it 
as this conception of induction admitted of the 
induction of the ancients has been well described by 
bacon under the name of inductio per enumera 
tionem simplicem ubi non reperitur instantia contra 
dictoria it consists in ascribing the character of 
general truths to all propositions which are true in 
every instance that we happen to know of this is 
the kind of induction if it deserves the name which 
is natural to the mind when unaccustomed to scien 
tific methods the tendency which some call an 
instinct and which others account for by association 
to infer the future from the past the known from the 
unknown is simply a habit of expecting that what 
has been found true once or several times and never 
yet found false will be found true again whether

the instances are few or many conclusive or incon 
clusive does not much affect the matter these are 
considerations which occur only on reflexion the 
unprompted tendency of the mind is to generalize its 
experience provided this points all in one direction 
provided no other experience of a conflicting character 
comes unsought the notion of seeking it of expe 
rimenting for it of interrogating nature to use 
bacons expression is of much later growth the 
observation of nature by uncultivated intellects is 
purely passive they take the facts which present 
themselves without taking the trouble of searching 
for more it is a superior mind only which asks 
itself what facts are needed to enable it to come to a 
sure conclusion and then looks out for these 

but although we have always a propensity to 
generalize from unvarying experience we are not 
always warranted in doing so before we can be at 
liberty to conclude that something is universally true 
because we have never known an instance to the 
contrary it must be proved to us that if there were 
in nature any instances to the contrary we should 
have known of them this assurance in the great 
majority of cases we cannot have or can have only in 
a very moderate degree the possibility of having 
it is the foundation on which we shall see hereafter 
that induction by simple enumeration may in some 
remarkable cases amoimt to fiill proof no such 
assurance however can be had on any of the ordi 
nary subjects of scientific inquiry popular notions 
are usually founded upon induction by simple enume 
ration in science it carries us but a little way we 
are forced to begin with it we must often rely upon

it provisionally in the absence of means of more 
searching investigation but for the accurate study 
of nature we require a surer and a more potent 
instrument 

it was above all by pointing out the insufficiency 
of this rude and loose conception of induction that 
bacon merited the title so generally awarded to him 
of founder of the inductive philosophy the value 
of his own contributions to a more philosophical 
theory of the subject has certainly been exaggerated 
although along with some fundamental errors his 
writings contain more or less fully developed several 
of the most important principles of the inductive 
method physical investigation has now far outgrown 
the baconian conception of inductioiu moral and 
political inquiry indeed are as yet far bdiind that 
conception the current and approved modes of 
reasoning on these subjects are still of the same 
vicious description against which bacon protested 
the method almost exclusively employed by those 
professing to treat such matters inductively is the 
very inductio per enumerationem simjdicem whidi he 
condemns and the experience which we hear so 
confidently appealed to by all sects parties and 
interests is still in his own emphatic words mera 
palpatio 

 in order to a better understanding of the 
problem which the logician must solve if he would 
establish a scientific theory of induction let u com 
pare a few cases of incorrect inductions with others 
which are acknowledged to be legitimate some we 
know which were believed for centuries to be correct 
were nevertheless incorrect that all swans are 
white cannot have been a good induction since the

conclusion has turned out erroneous the expe 
rience however on which the conclusion rested was 
genuine from the earuest records the testimony of 
all the inhabitants of the known world was unanimous 
on the point the uniform experience therefore of 
the inhabitants of the known world agreeing in a 
common result without one known instance of devia 
tion from that result is not always sufficient to establish 
a general conclusion 

but let us now turn to an instance apparently not 
very dissimilar to this mankind were wrong it 
seems in concluding that all swans were white are 
we also wrong when we conclude that all mens heads 
grow above their shoulders and never below in spite 
of the conflicting testimony of the naturalist pliny 
as there were black swans although civilized men 
had existed for three thousand years on the earth 
without meeting with them may there not also be 
 men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders 
notwithstanding a rather less perfect unanimity of 
negative testimony from all observers most per 
sons would answer no it was more credible that a 
bird should vary in its colour than that man should 
vary in the relative position of his principal organs 
and there is no doubt that in so saying they would be 
right but to say why they are right would be impos 
sible without entering more deeply than is usually 
done into the true theory of induction 

again there are cases in which we reckon with 
the most unfailing confidence upon uniformity and 
other cases in which we do not coimt upon it at all in 
some we feel complete assurance that the future will 
resemble the past the unknown be precisely similar to 
the known in others however invariable may be 
the result obtained from the instances which we have

observed we draw from them no more than a very 
feeble presumption that the like result will hold in 
all other cases that a straight line is the shortest 
distance between two points we do not doubt to be 
true even in the region of the fixed stars when a 
chemist announces the existence and properties of a 
newlydiscovered substance if we confide in his accu 
racy we feel assured that the conclusions he has 
arrived at will hold universally although the induc 
tion be founded but on a single instance we do not 
withhold our assent waiting for a repetition of the 
experiment or if we do it is from a doubt whether 
the one experiment was properly made not whether 
if properly made it would be conclusive here then 
is a general law of nature inferred without hesitation 
from a single instance an universal proposition from 
a singular one now mark another case and contrast 
it with this not all the instances which have been 
observed since the beginning of the world in support 
of the general proposition that all crows are black 
would be deemed a sufficient presumption of the truth 
of the proposition to outweigh the testimony of one 
unexceptionable witness who should affirm that in 
some region of the earth not fully explored he had 
caught and examined a crow and had found it to be 
grey 

why is a single instance in some cases sufficient 
for a complete induction while in others myriads 
of concurring instances without a single exception 
known or presumed go such a very little way towards 
establishing an universal proposition whoever can 

f answer this question knows more of the philosophy 
of logic than the wisest of the ancients and has

chapter iv 
of laws of nature 

 in the contemplation of that uniformity in 
the course of nature which is assumed in every 
inference from experience one of the first observa 
tions that present themselves is that the uniformity 
in question is not properly uniformity but uni 
formiti es the general regularity results from the 
coexistence of partial regularities the course of 
nature in general is constant because the course of 
each of the various phenomena that compose it is 
so a certain fact invariably occurs whenever cer 
tain circumstances are present and does not occur 
when they are absent the like is true of another 
fact and so on from these separate threads of 
connexion between parts of the great whole which we 
term nature a general tissue of connexion unavoidably 
weaves itself by which the whole is held together 
if a is always accompanied by d b by e and c by 
f it follows that a b is accompanied by d e ac 
bydf bcbyef and finally abc bydef 
and thus the general character of regularity is pro 
duced which along with and in the midst of infinite 
diversity pervades all nature 

the first point therefore to be noted in regard to 
what is called the uniformity of the course of nature 
is that it is itself a complex fact compounded of all 
the separate uniformities which exist in respect to 
single phenomena these various uniformities when 
ascertained by what is regarded as a sufficient induc 
tion we call in common parlance laws of nature

 induction 

scientifically speaking that title is employed in a 
more restricted sense to designate the uniformities 
when reduced to their most simple expression thus 
in the illustration already employed there were seven 
uniformities all of which if considered suflsciently 
certain would in the more lax application of the 
term be called laws of nature but of the seven 
three alone are properly distinct and independent 
these being presupposed the others follow of course 
the three first therefore according to the stricter 
accqtation are called laws of nature the remainder 
not because they are in truth mere cases of the 
three first virtually included in them said there 
fore to result from them whoever affirms those 
three has already affirmed all the rest 

to substitute real examples for symbolical ones 
the following are three uniformities or call them 
laws of nature the law that air has weight the law 
that pressure on a fluid is propagated equally in all 
directions and the law that pressure in one direction 
not opposed by an equal pressure in the contrary 
direction produces motion which does not cease 
until equilibrium is restored from these three uni 
formities we should be able to predict another imi 
formity namely the rise of the mercury in the 
torricellian tube this in the stricter use of the 
phrase is not a law of nature it is a result of laws 
of nature it is a case of each and every one of the 
three laws and is the only occurrence by which they 
could all be fulfilled if the mercury were not sus 
tained in the barometer and sustained at such a hdght 
that the column of mercury were equal in weight to a 
column of the atmosphere of the same diameter 
here would be a case either of the air not pressing 
upon the surface of the mercury with the £cxtce which

law of nature 

i called its weight or of the downward pressure on 
the mercury not being propagated equally in an 
upward direction or of a body pressed in one direc 
tion and not in the direction opposite either not 
moving in the direction in which it is pressed or 
stopping before it had attained equilibrium if we 
knew therefore the three simple laws but had never 
tried the torricellian experiment we might deduce its 
result from those laws the known weight of the air 
combined with the position of the apparatus would 
bring the mercury within the first of the three in 
ductions the first induction would bring it within 
the second and the second within the third in the 
manner which we so fully illustrated in treating of 
ratiocination we should thus come to know the 
more complex uniformity independently of specific 
experience throu our knowledge of the simpler 
ones from which it results although for reasons 
which will appear hereafter verification by specific 
experience would still be desirable and might possibly 
be indispensable 

complex uniformities which like this are mere 
cases of simpler ones and have therefore been vir 
tually inferred in affirming those may with propriety 
be called imosy but can scarcely in the strictness of 
scientific speech be termed laws of nature it is the 
custom of philosophers wherever they can trace 
regularity of any kind to call the general proposition 
which represses the nature of that regularity a law 
as when in nhematics we speak of the law of 
decrease of the successive terms of a converging series 
but the expression law af nature is generally em 
ployed by scientific men with a sort of tacit reference 
to the original seose of the word law namely the 
qression of the will of a superior the superior in

this instance being the ruler of the universe when 
therefore it appeared that any of the uniformities 
which were observed in nature would result sponta 
neously from certain other uniformities without any 
separate act of creative will the former have not 
usually been spoken of as laws of nature according 
to another mode of expression the question what 
are the laws of nature may be stated thus — what 
are the fewest and simplest assumptions which being 
granted the whole existing order of nature would 
result another mode of stating it would be thus 
what are the fewest general propositions from which 
all the uniformities which exist in the universe might 
be deductively inferred 

as has already been hinted and will be more 
fully discussed hereafter every great advance which 
marks an epoch in the progress of science has con 
sisted in a step made towards the solution of this 
problem even a simple colligation of inductions 
already made without any fresh extension of the 
inductive inference is already an advance in that 
direction when kepler expressed the regularity 
which exists in the observed motions of the heavenly 
bodies by the three general propositions caued his 
laws he in so doing pointed out three simple voli 
tions by which instead of a much greater number 
it appeared that the whole scheme of the heavenly 
motions so far as yet observed might be con 
ceived to have been produced a similar and still 
greater step was made when these laws which 
at first did not seem to be included in any more 
general truths were discovered to be cases of the 
three laws of motion as obtaining among bodies 
which mutually tend towards one another with a 
certain force and have had a certain instantaneous

impulse originally impressed upon them after this 
great discovery keplers three propositions though 
still called laws would hardly by any person accus 
tomed to use language with precision be termed laws 
of nature that phrase would be reserved for the 
simpler laws into which newton as the expression 
is resolved them 

according to this language every wellgrounded 
inductive generalization is either a law of nature or a 
result of laws of nature capable if those laws are 
known of being predicted from them and the 
problem of inductive logic may be summed up in 
two questions how to ascertain the laws of nature 
and how after having ascertained them to follow 
them into their results on the other hand we must 
not suffer ourselves to imagine that this mode of 
statement amounts to a real analysis or to anything 
but a mere verbal transformation of the problem 
for the expression laws of nature meam nothing 
but the uniformities which exist among natural phe 
nomena or in other words the results of induction 
when reduced to their simplest expression it is 
however something to have advanced so far as to 
see that the study of nature is the study of laws not 
a law of uniformities in the plural number that 
the different natural phenomena have their separate 
rules or modes of taking place which though much 
intermixed and entangled with one another may to a 
certain extent be studied apart that to resume our 
former metaphor the regularity which exists in 
nature is a web composed of distinct threads and only 
to be understood by tracing each of the threads sepa 
rately for which purpose it is often necessary to 
unravel some portion of the web and exhibit the fibres

apart tlie rulf of experimental inquiry are the 
contrivances for unravelling the web 

 in thus attempting to ascertain the general 
order of nature by ascertaining the particular order 
of the occurrence of each one of the phenomena of 
nature the most scientific proceeding can be no more 
than an improved form of that which was primitively 
pursued by the human understanding as yet undirected 
by science when men first formed the idea of 
studying phenomena according to a stricter and surer 
method than that which they had in the first instance 
spontaneously adopted they did not conformably to 
the well meant but impracticable precept of descartes 
set out from the supposition that nothing had been 
already ascertained many of the uniformities exist 
ing among phenomena are so constant and so open 
to observation as to force themselves upon mens 
involimtary recognition some facts are so perpe 
tually and familiarly accompanied by certain others 
that mankind learnt as children now learn to expect 
the one where they found the other long before they 
knew how to put their expectation into words by 
asserting in a proposition the existence of a con 
nexion between those phenomena no science was 
needed to teach men that food nourishes that water 
drowns or quenches thirst that the sun gives light 
and heat that bodies fall to the groimd the first 
scientific inquirers assumed these and the like as 
known truths and set out from them to discover 
others which were unknown nor were they wrong in 
so doing subject however as they afterwards began 
to see to an ulterior revision of these spontaneous 
generalizations themselves when the progress of

knowledge pointed out limits to them or shewed 
their truth to be contingent upon some other circum 
stance not originally attended to it will appear i 
thmk from the subsequent part of our inquiry that 
there is no logical fallacy in this mode of proceed 
ing but we may see already that any other mode 
is rigorously impracticable since it is impossible to 
frame any scientific method of induction or test of the 
correctness of inductions unless upon the hypothesis 
that some inductions of unquestionable certainty have 
been already made 

let us revert for instance to one of our former 
illustrations and consider why it is that with exactly 
the same amount of evidence both negative and 
positive we did not reject the assertion that there are 
black swans while we should refuse credence to any 
testimony which asserted that there were men wearing 
their heads underneath their shoulders the first 
assertion was more credible than the latter but 
why more credible so long as neither phenomenon 
had been actually witnessed what reason was there 
for finding the one harder to believehan the other 
apparently because there is less constancy in the 
colours of animals than in the general structure of 
their internal anatomy but how do we know this 
doubtless from experience it appears then that we 
need experience to inform us in what cases or in 
what sorts of cases experience is to be relied upoo 
experience must be consulted in order to learn from 
it mder what circumstances arguments from it will 
be valid we have no ulterior test to which we 
subject experience in general but we make expe 
rience its own test experience testifies that among 
the uniformities which it exhibits or seems to exhibit 
some are more to be relied upon than others and

uniformity therefore may be presumed from any 
given number of instances with a greater degree of 
assurance in proportion as the case belongs to a class 
in which the uniformities have hitherto been found 
more uniform 

this mode of correcting one generalization by 
means of another a narrower generalization by a 
wider which common sense suggests and adopts in 
practice is the real type of scientific induction all 
that art can do is but to give accuracy and precision 
to this process and adapt it to all varieties of cases 
without any essential alteration in its principle 

there are of course no means of applying such a 
test as that above described unless we already possess 
a general knowledge of the prevalent character of the 
uniformities existing throughout nature the indis 
pensable foundation therefore of a scientific formula of 
induction must be a survey of the inductions to which 
mankind have been conducted in unscientific practice 
with the special purpose of ascertaining what kinds 
of uniformities have been found perfectly invariable 
pervading all natm and what are those which have 
been found to vary with difference of time place or 
other changeable circumstances 

§ the necessity of such a survey is confirmed 
by the consideration that the stronger inductions are 
the touchstone to which we always endeavour to bring 
the weaker if we find any means of deducing one 
of the less strong inductions from stronger ones 
it acquires at once all the strength of those from 
which it is deduced and even adds to that strength 
since the independent experience on which the 
weaker induction previously rested becomes addi 
tional evidence of the truth of the better esta

we may have inferred from historical evidence that 
the uncontrolled government of a monarchy of an 
aristocracy or of the majority will commonly be a 
tyranny but we are entitled to rely upon this gene 
ralization with much greater assurance when it is 
shown to be a corollary from still better established 
truths the infirmity of human nature and the impos 
sibity of maintaining the predominance of reason and 
conscience over the selfish propensities by any means 
except such as the supposition of absolute power neces

even these great facts in human nature derive an acces 
sion of evidence fixm the testimony which history 
bears to the eflfects of despotism the strong induc 
tion becomes still stronger when a weaker one has 
been bound up with it 

on the other hand if an induction conflicts with 
stronger inductions or with conclusions capable of 
being correctly deduced from them then unless upon 
reconsideration it should appear that some of the 
stronger inductions have been stretched too far the 
weaker one must give way the opinion so long pre 
valent that a comet or any other unusual appearance 
in the heavenly regions was the precursor of cala 
mities to mankind or to those at least who witnessed 
it the belief in the veracity of the oracles of delphi 
or dodona the reliance on astrology or on the 
weatherprophecies in almanacs were doubtless induc

is their inconsistency with the stronger inductionii 
subsequently obtained by scientific inquiry respecting 
the causes upon which terrestrial events really depend 
and where those scientific truths have not yet pene 
trated the same or similar delusions still prevail 

it may be affirmed as a general principle that all 
inductions whether strong or weak which can be 
connected together by a ratiocination are confirma 
tory of one another while any which lead deductively 
to consequences that are incompatible become mutu 
ally each others test showing that one or other must 
be given up or at least more guardedly expressed 
in the case of inductions which confirm each other 
the one which becomes a conclusion from ratiocina 
tion rises to at least the level of certainty of the 
weakest of those from which it is deduced while 
in general all are more or less increased in cer 
tainty thus the torricellian experiment though a 
mere case of three more general laws not only 
strengthened greatly the evidence on which those 
laws rested but converted one of them the weight of 
the atmosphere from a doubtful generalization into 
one of the bestestablished doctrines in the range of 
physical science 

if then a survey of the uniformities which have 
been ascertained to exist in nature should point out 
some which as far as any human purpose requires 
certainty may be considered as absolutely certain 
and absolutely universal then by means of these 
uniformities we may be able to raise multitudes of 
other inductions to the same point in the scale for 
if we can show with respect to any induction that 
either it must be true or one of these certain and 
universal inductions must admit of an exception the 
former generalization will attain the same absolute

chapter v 
of the law of universal causation 

§ thb phenomena of nature exist in two 
ditinct relations to one another that of simultaneity 
and that of succession every phenomenon is related 
in an uniform manner to some phenomena that 
coexist with it and to some that have preceded or wiu 
follow it 

of the uniformities which exist among synchronous 
phenomena the most important on every account 
are the laws of number and next to them those of 
space or in other words of extension and figure 
the laws of number are common to synchronous and 
successive phenomena that two and two make 
four is equally true whether the second two follow 
the first two or accompany them it is as true of 
days and years as of feet and inches the laws of 
extension and figure in other words the theorems of 
geometry from its lowest to its highest branches are 
on the contrary laws of simultaneous phenomena only 
the various parts of space and of the objects which 
are said to fill space coexist and the unvarying laws 
which are the subject of the science of geometry are 
an expression of the mode of their coexistence 

this is a class of laws or in other words of unifor 
mities for the comprehension and proof of which it is 
not necessary to suppose any lapse of time any variety 
of facts or events succeeding one another if all the 
objects in the universe were unchangeably fixed and 
had remained in that condition from eternity the 
propositions of geometry would still be true of those

law of causation 

objects all things which possess extension or in 
other words which fill space are subject to geome 
trical laws possessing extension they possess figure 
possesshxg figure they must possess some figure in 
particular and have all the properties which geometry 
assigns to that figure if one body be a sphere and 
the other a cylinder of equal height and diameter 
the one will be exactly twothirds of the other let 
the nature and quality of the material be what it will 
again each body and each point of a body must 
occupy some place or position among other bodies 
and the position of two bodies relatively to each 
other of whatever nature the bodies be may be 
unerringly inferred from the position of each of them 
relatively to any third body 

in the laws of number then and in those of space 
we recognise in the most unqualified manner the 
rigorous universality of which we are in quest those 
laws have been in all ages the type of certainty the 
standard of comparison for all inferior degrees of 
evidence their invariability is so perfect that we 
are unable even to conceive any exception to them 
and philosophers have been led although as i have 
endeavoured to show erroneously to consider their 
evidence as lying not in experience but in the original 
constitution of the human intellect if therefore 
from the laws of space and number we were able to 
deduce uniformities of any other description this 
would be conclusive evidence to us that those other 
uniformities possessed the same degree of rigorous 
certainty but this we cannot do from laws of 
space and number alone nothing can be deduced but 
laws of space and number 

of all truths relating to phenomena the most 
valuable to us are those which relate to the order of

 induction 

their succession on a knowledge of these is founded 
every reasonable anticipation of future facts and what 
ever power we possess of influencing those facts to 
our advantage even the laws of geometry are chiefly 
of practical importance to us as being a portion of the 
premisses from which the order of the succession of 
phenomena may be inferred 

inasmuch as the motion of bodies the action of 
forces and the propagation of influences of au sorts 
take place in certain lines and over definite spaces the 
properties of those lines and spaces are an important 
part of the laws to which those phenomena are them 
selves subject moreover motions forces or other 
influences and times are numerable quantities and the 
properties of number are applicable to them as to all 
other things but although the laws of number and 
space are important elements in the ascertainment of 
uniformities of succession they can do nothing towards 
it when taken by themselves they can only be made 
instrumental to that purpose when we combine with 
them additional premisses expressive of uniformities 
of succession already known by taking for instance 
as premisses these propositions that bodies acted 
upon by an instantaneous force move with uniform 
velocity in straight lines that bodies acted upon by 
a continuous force move with accelerated velocity in 
straight lines and that bodies acted upon by two 
forces in difierent directions move in the diagonal of 
a parallelogram whose sides represent the direction 
and quantity of those forces we may by combining 
these truths with propositions relating to the pro 
perties of straight lines and of parallelograms as 
that a triangle is half of a parallelogram of the same 
base and altitude deduce another important uniformity 
of succession viz that a body moving round a centre

law of causation 

of force describes areas proportional to the times 
but unless there had been laws of succession in our 
premisses there could have been no truths of succes 
sion in our conclusions a similar remark might be 
extended to every other class of phenomena really 
peculiar and had it been attended to would have 
prevented many chimerical attempts at demonstrations 
of the indemonstrable and explanations of what can 
not be explained 

it is not therefore enough for us that the laws 
of space which are only laws of simultaneous phe 
nomena and the laws of number which though true 
of successive phenomena do not relate to their suc 
cession possess that rigorous certainty and univer 
sality of which we are in search we must endeavour 
to jsnd some law of succession which has those same 
attributes and is therefore fit to be made the founda 
tion of processes for discovering and of a test for 
verifying all othelr uniformities of succession this 
fundamental law must resemble the truths of geometry 
in their most remarkable peculiarity that of never 
 being in any instance whatever defeated or suspended 
by any change of circumstances 

now among all those uniformities in the suc 
cession of phenomena which common observation 
is sufficient to bring to light there are very few which 
have any even apparent pretension to this rigorous 
indefeasibility and of those few one only has been 
found capable of completely sustaining it in that 
one however we recognise a law which is universal 
also in another sense it is coextensive with the entire 
field of successive phenomena au instances whatever 
of succession being examples of it this law is the 
law of causation it is an universal truth that every 
fact which has a beginning has a cause

 induction 

this generalization may appear to some minds 
not to amount to much since after all it asserts only 
this it is a law that every event depends upon 
some law we must not however conclude that 
the generality of the principle is merely verbal it 
will be found upon inspection to be no vague or 
unmeaning assertion but a most important and really 
fundamental truth 

§ the notion of cause being the root of the 
whole theory of induction it is indispensable that this 
idea should at the very outset of our inquiry be with 
the utmost practicable degree of precision fixed and 
determined if indeed it were necessary for the 
purposes of inductive logic that the strife should be 
quelled which has so long raged among the difierent

such causes exist at all i am not called upon to give 
an opinion the notion of cusation is deemed by 
the schools of metaphysics most in vogue at the 
present moment to imply a mysterious and most 
powerful tie such as cannot or at least does not 
exist between any physical fact and that other phy 
sical fact upon which it is invariably consequent and 
which is popularly termed its cause and thence is 
deduced the supposed necessity of ascending higher 
into the essences and inherent constitution of things to 
find the true cause the cause which is not only followed 
by but actuauy produces the effect no such necessity 
exists for the purposes of the present inquiry nor 
will any such doctrine be found in the following pages

with it we are in no way concerned in the question 
the only notion of a cause which the theory of induc 
tion requires is such a notion as can be gained from 
experience the law of causation the recognition 
of which is the main pillar of inductive philosophy 
is but the familiar truth that invariability of succes 
sion is found by observation to obtain between every 
fact in nature and some other fact which has pre 
ceded it independently of all consideration respecting 
the ultimate mode of production of phenomena and 
of every other question regarding the nature of 
 thmgs in themselves 

between the phenomena then which exist at any 
instant and the phenomena which exist at the suc 
ceeding instant there is an invariable order of succes

uniformity of the course of nature this web is com 
posed of separate fibres this collective order is made 
up of particular sequences obtaining invariably among 
the separate parts to certain facts certain facts 
always do and as we believe always will succeed 
the invariable antecedent is termed the cause the 
invariable consequent the effect and the universality 
of the law of causation consists in this that every 
consequent is connected in this manner with some 
particular antecedent or set of antecedents let the 
fact be what it may if it has begun to exist it was 
preceded by some fact or facts with which it is inva 
riably connected for every event there exists some 
combination of objects or events some given concur 
rence of circumstances positive and negative the 
occurrence of which will always be followed by that 
phenomenon we may not have found out what 
this concurrence of circumstances may be but we 
never doubt that there is such a one and that it never 
occurs without having the phenomenon in question as 
its effect or consequence upon the universality of 
this truth depends the possibility of reducing the 
inductive process to rules the undoubted assurance 
we have that there is a law to be found if we only 
knew how to find it will be seen presently to be the 
source from which the canons of the inductive logic 
derive their vaudity 

 it is seldom if ever between a consequent 
and one single antecedent that this invariable se 
quence subsists it is usually between a consequent 
and the sum of several antecedents the concurrence 
of them all being requisite to produce that is to be 
certain of being followed by the consequent in such 
cases it is very common to single out one only of the

antecedents under the denomination of caqse calling 
the others merely conditions thus if a man eats of a 
particular dish and dies in consequence that is 
would not have died if he had not eaten of it people 
would be apt to say that eating of that dish was the 
cause of his death there needs not however be 
any invariable connexion between eating of the dish 
and death but there certainly is among the circum 
stances which took place some combination or other 
upon which death is invariably consequent as for 
instance the act of eating of the dish combined with 
a particular bodily constitution a particular state of 
present health and perhaps even a certain state of the 
atmosphere the whole of which circumstances per 
haps constituted in this particular case the conditions 
of the phenomenon or in other words the set of 
antecedents which determined it and but for which it 
would not have happened the real cause is the 
whole of these antecedents and we have philoso 
phically speaking no right to give the name of cause 
to one of them exclusively of the others what in 
the case we have supposed disguises the incorrectness 
of the expression is this that the various conditions 
except the single one of eating the food were not 
events that is instantaneous changes or successions 
of instantaneous changes but states possessing more 
or less of permanency and might therefore have 
preceded the effect by an indefinite length of duration 
for want of the event which was requisite to complete 
the required concurrence of conditions while as soon 
as that event eating the food occurs no other cause 
is waited for but the effect begins immediately to 
take place and hence the appearance is presented of 
a more immediate and closer connexion between the 
effect and that one antecedent than between the effect

and the remaining conditions but although we may 
think proper to give the name of cause to that one 
condition the fulfilment of which completes the tale 
and brings about the effect without further delay this 
condition has really no closer relation to the effect 
than any of the other conditions has the production 
of the consequent required that they should all exist 
immediately previous though not that they should all 
begin to exist immediately previous the statement 
of the cause is incomplete unless in some shape or 
other we introduce all the conditions a man takes 
mercury goes out of doors and catches cold we 
say perhaps that the cause of his taking cold was 
exposure to the air it is clear however that his 
having taken mercury may have been a necessary 
condition of his catching cold and though it might 
consist with usage to say that the cause of his attack 
was exposure to the air to be accurate we ought to 
say that the cause was exposure to the air while under 
the effect of mercury 

if we do not when aiming at accuracy enumerate 
all the conditions it is only because some of them 
will in most cases be understood without being 
expressed or because for the purpose in view they 
may without detriment be overlooked for exam 
ple when we say the cause of a mans death was 
that his foot slipped in climbing a ladder we omit 
as a thing unnecessary to be stated the circum 
stance of his weight though quite as indispensable

of a legislative assembly has been determined by the 
casting vote of ihe chairman we often say that this one 
person was the cause of all the effects which resulted 
from the enactment yet we do not really suppose 
that his single vote contributed more to the result 
than that of any other person who voted in the 
affirmative but for the purpose we have in view 
which is that of fixing him with the responsibility the 
share which any other person took in the transaction 
is not material 

in all these instances the fact which was dignified by 
the name of cause was the one condition which came 
last into existence but it must not be supposed 
that in the employment of the term this or any other 
rule is always adhered to nothing can better sho 
the absence of any scientific ground for the distinction 
between the cause of a phenomenon and its conditions 
than the capricious manner in which we select from 
among the conditions that which we choose to deno 
minate the cause however numerous the conditions 
may be there is hardly any of them which may not 
according to the purpose of our immediate discourse 
obtain that nominal preeminence this will be seen 
by analyzing the conditions of some one familiar 
phenomenon for example a stone thrown into 
water falls to the bottom what are the conditions of 
this event in the first place there must be a stone 
and water and the stone must be thrown into the 
water but these suppositions forming part of the 
enunciation of the phenomenon itself to include them 
also among the conditions would be a vicious tauto 
logy and this class of conditions therefore have 
never received the name of cause from any but the

must be an earth and accordingly it is often said 
that the fall of a stone is caused by the earth or by 
a power or property of the earth or a force exerted 
by the earth all of which are merely roundabout ways 
of saying that it is caused by the earth or lastly 
the earths attraction which also is only a technical 
mode of saying that the earth causes the motion with 
the additional particularity that the motion is towards 
the earth which is not a character of the cause but 
of the effect let us now pass to another condition 
it is not enough that the earth should exist the 
body must be within that distance from it in which 
the earths attraction preponderates over that of any 
other body accordingly we may say and the ex 
pression would be confessedly correct that the cause 
of the stones falling is its being within the sphere of 
the earths attraction we proceed to a further con 
dition the stone is immersed in water it is there 
fore a condition of its reaching the ground that its 
specific gravity exceed that of the surrounding fluid 
or in other words that it surpass in weight an equal 
volume of water accordingly any one would be 
acknowledged to speak correctly who said that the 
cause of the stones going to the bottom is its exceed 
ing in specific gravity the fluid in which it is immersed 
thus we see that each and every condition of 
the phenomenon may be taken in its turn and 
with equal propriety in common parlance but with 
equal impropriety in scientific discourse may be 
spoken of as if it were the entire cause and in 
practice that particular condition is usually styled 
the cause whose share in the matter is superficially

the production of the effect we happen to be insist

this last consideration that it often induces us to 
give the name of cause even to one of the negative 
conditions we say for example the cause of the 
armys being surprised was the sentinels being off his 
post but since the sentinels absence was not what 
created the enemy or made the soldiers to be asleep 
how did it cause them to be surprised all that is 
really meant is that the event would not have happened 
if he had been at his duty his being off his post was no 
producing cause but the mere absence of a preventing 
cause it was simply equivalent to his nonexistence 
from nothing from a mere negation no conse 
quences can proceed all effects are connected by the 
law of causation with some set of positive conditions 
negative ones it is true being almost always required 
in addition in other words every fact or pheno 
menon which has a beginning invariably arises when 
some certain combination of ppsitve facts exists pro 
vided certain other positive facts do not exist 

since then mankind are accustomed with ac 
knowledged propriety so far as the ordinances of 
language are concerned to give the name of cause 
to almost any one of the conditions of a phenomenon 
or any portion of the whole number arbitrarily 
selected without excepting even those conditions 
which are purely negative and in themselves inca 
pable of causing anything it will probably be ad 
mitted without longer discussion that no one of the 
conditions has more claim to that title than another 
and that the real cause of the phenomenon is the 
assemblage of all its conditions there is no doubt 
a tendency which our first example that of death 
from taking a particular food suflsciently illustrates 
to associate the idea of causation with the proxi 
mate antecedent event rather than with any of the 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

antecedent states or permanent facts which may 
happen also to be conditions of the phenomenon the 
reason being that the event not only exists but begins 
to exist immediately previous while the other con 
ditions may have preexisted for an indefinite time 
and this tendency shows itself very visibly in the dif 
ferent logical fictions which are resorted to even by 
philosophers to avoid the necessity of giving the name 
of cause to anything which had existed for an indeter 
minate length of time before the effect thus rather 
than say that the earth causes the fall of bodies 
they ascribe it to a force exerted by the earth or an 
attraction by the earth abstractions which they can 
represent to themselves as exhausted by each effort 
and therefore constituting at each successive instant a 
fresh fact simultaneous with or only immediately pre 
ceding the effect inasmuch as the coming of the 
circumstance which completes the assemblage of con 
ditions is a change or event it thence happens that 
an event is always the antecedent in closest apparent 
proximity to the consequent and this may accoimt for 
the illusion which disposes us to look upon the proxi 
mate event as standing more pecuuarly in the position 
of a cause than any of the antecedent states but even 
this peculiarity of being in closer proximity to the eflfect 
than any other of its conditions is as we have already 
seen far firom being necessary to the common notion 
of a cause with which notion on the contrary any 
one of the conditions either positive or negative is 
found upon occasion completely to accord 

the cause then philosophically speaking is the 
sum total of the conditions positive and negative 
taken together the whole of the contingencies of 
every description which being realized the conse 
quent invariably follows the negative conditions

however of any phenomenon a special enumeration 
of which would generally be very prolix may be all 
summed up under one head namely the absence of pre 
venting or counteracting causes the convenience of 
this mode of expression is grounded mainly upon the 
fact that the effects of any cause in counteracting ano 
ther cause may in most cases be with strict scientific 
exactness regarded as a mere extension of its own 
proper and separate effects if gravity retards the 
upward motion of a projectile and deflects it into a 
parabouc trajectory it produces in so doing the very 
same kind of effect and even as mathematicians 
know the same quantity of effect as it does in its 
ordinary operation of causing the fall of bodies when 
simply deprived of their support if an alkaline 
solution mixed with an acid destroys its sourness 
and prevents it from reddening vegetable blues it is 
because the specific effect of the alkali is to combine 
with the acid and form a compound with totally 
different qualities this property which causes of all 
descriptions possess of preventing the effects of other 
causes by virtue for the most part of the same laws 
according to which they produce their own enables

objects which seem to be purely preventive as the property of 
opaque bodies by which they intercept the passage of light this 
 far as we are able to understand it appears an instance not of 
one cause counteracting another by the same law whereby it pro 
duces its own effects but of an agency which manifests itself in no 
other way than in defeating the effects of another agency if we 
knew upon what other relations to light or upon what peculiarities 
of structure opacity depends we might find that this is only an 
apparent not a real exception to the general proposition in the

are liable to be counteracted in their effects by one 
another to dispense with the consideration of negative 
conditions entirely and limit the notion of cause to 
the assemblage of the positive conditions of the pheno 
menon one negative condition invariably under 
stood and the same in all instances namely the 
absence of all counteracting causes being sufficient 
along with the sum of the positive conditions to make 
up the whole set of circumstances upon which the 
phenomenon is dependant 

§ among the positive conditions as we have 
seen that there are some to which in common par 
lance the term cause is more readily and frequently 
awarded so there are others to which it is in ordinary 
circumstances refused in most cases of causation 
a distinction is commonly drawn between something 
which acts and some other thing which is acted upon 
between an agent and a patient both of these it 
would be universally allowed are conditions of the 
phenomenon but it would be thought absurd to call 
the latter the cause that title being reserved for the 
former the distinction however vanishes on exami 
nation or rather is found to be only verbal arising 
from an incident of mere expression namely that the 
object said to be ated upon and which is considered 
as the scene in which the effect takes place is com 
monly included in the phrase by which the effect is 



tiolated by such cases as this although if all counteractidg 
agencies were of this description there would be no purpose served 
by emplopng the formula since wo should still have to enumerate 
specially the negative conditions of each phenomenon instead of 
regarding them as implicitly contained in the positive laws of the

poken of so that if it were also reckoned as part of 
the cause the seeming incongruity would arise of its 
being supposed to cause itself in the instance which 
we have already had of falling bodies the question was 
thus put — what is the cause which makes a stone 
fall and if the answer had been the stone itself 
the expression would have been in apparent contra 
diction to the meaning of the word cause the stone 
therefore is conceived as the patient and the earth 
or according to the common and most unphiloso 
phical practice some occult quality of the earth is 
represented as the agent or cause but that there is 
nothing fundamental in the distinction may be seen 
from this that if we do but alter the mere wording of 
the question and express it thus what is the cause 
which produces vertical motion towards the earth 
we might now without any incongruity speak of the 
stone or other heavy body as the agent which by 
virtue of its own laws or properties commences 
moving towards the earth j although to save the esta 
blished doctrine of the inactivity of matter men 
usually prefer here also to ascribe the effect to an 
occult quality and say that the cause is not the stone 
itself but the weight or gravitation of the stone 

those who have contended for a radical distinc 
tion between agent and patient have generally con 
ceived the agent as that which causes some state of 
or some change in the state of another object which is 
called the patient but a little reflection will show 
that the license we assume of speaking of phenomena 
as states of the various objects which take part in 
them an artifice of which so much use has been 
made by some philosophers brown in particular for 
the apparent explanation of phenomena is simply a 
sort of logical fiction useful sometimes as one among

several modes of expression but which should never 
be supposed to be the statement of a philosophical 
truth even those of the attributes of an object 
which might seem with greatest propriety to be 
called states of the object itself its sensible equalities 
its colour hardness shape and the like are in reality 
as no one has pointed out more clearly than brown 
himself phenomena of causation in which the sub 
stance is distinctly the agent or producing cause the 
patient being our own organs and those of other 
sentient beingfe what we call the states of objects 
are always sequences into which those objects enter 
generally as antecedents or causes and things are 
never more active than in the production of those phe 
nomena in which they are said to be acted upon 
thus in the last example that of a sensation pro 
duced in our organs are not the laws of our organi 
zation and even those of our minds as directly ope 
rative in determining the effect produced as the laws 
of the outward object though we call prussic acid 
the agent of a mans death are not the whole of the 
vital and organic properties of the patient as actively 
instrumental as the poison in the chain of effects 
which so rapidly terminates his sentient existence 
in the process of education we may call the teacher 
the agent and the scholar only the material acted 
upon yet in truth all the facts which preexisted 
in the scholars mind exert either cooperating or 
counteracting agencies in relation to the teachers

such a degree as to react raost forcibly upon the 
causes which acted upon them and even when this is 
not the case they contribute in the same manner as

effect of which they are vulgarly treated as the mere 
theatre all the positive conditions of a phenome

which is of firstrate importance both for clearing up 
the notion of cause and for obviating a very specious 
objection often made against the view which we have

when we define the cause of anything in the 
only sense in which the present inquiry has any con 
cern with causes to be hhe antecedent which it inva 
riably follows we do not use this phrase as exactly 
synonymous with the antecedent which it invariably 
has followed in our past experience such a mode 
of viewing causation would be liable to the objection 
very plausibly urged by dr reid namely that 
according to this doctrine night must be the cause of 
day £md day the cause of night since these pheno 
mena have invariably succeeded one another from the 
beginning of the world but it is necessary to our 
using the word cause that we should believe not only 
that the antecedent always has been followed by the 
consequent but that as long as the present constitu

would not be true of day and night we do not 
believe that night will be followed by day under any 
imaginable circumstances but only that it will be so 
provided the sun rises above the horizon if the sun 
ceased to rise which for aught we know may be per 
fectly compatible with the general laws of matter 
night would be or might be eternal on the other 
hand if the sun is above the horizon his light not 
extinct and no opaque body between us and him we 
believe firmly that unless a change takes place in the 
properties of matter this combination of antecedents 
will be followed by the consequent day that if the 
combination of antecedents could be indefinitely pro 
longed it would be always day and that if the same 
combination had always existed it would always have 
been day quite independently of night as a previous 
condition therefore is it that we do not call night 
the cause nor even a condition of day the exist 
ence of the sun or some such luminous body and 
there being np opaque medium in a straight line 
between that body and the part of the earth where we 
are situated are the sole conditions and the union of 
these without the addition of any superfluous circum 
stance constitutes the cause this is what writers 
mean when they say that the notion of cause in 
volves the idea of necessity if there be any mean 
ing which confessedly belongs to the term necessity it 
is unconditionalness that which is necessary that 
which must be means that which will be whatever

in reality the line in question is not exactly straight for from the

supposition we may make in regard to all other things 
the succession of day and night evidently is not 
necessary in this sense it is conditional upon the 
occurrence of other antecedents that which will be 
followed by a given consequent when and only when 
some third circumstance also exists is not the cause 
even although no case should have ever occurred in 
which the phenomenon took place without it 

invariable sequence therefore is not synonymous 
with causation unless the sequence besides beings 
invariable is imconditional there are sequences as 
uniform in past experience as any others whatever 
which yet we do not regard as cases of causation but 
as conjunctions in some sort accidental such to a 
philosopher is that of day and night the one might 
have existed for any length of time and the other not 
have followed the sooner for its existence it follows 
only if certain other antecedents exist and where 
those antecedents existed it would follow in any case 
no one probably ever called night the cause of day 
mankind must so soon have arrived at the very obvi 
ous generalization that the state of general illumina 
tion which we call day would follow the presence of a 
sufficiently luminous body whether darkness had pre 
ceded or not 

we may define therefore the cause of a phenome 
non to be the antecedent or the concurrence of ante 
cedents upon which it is invariably and unconditionally 
consequent or if we adopt the convenient modifi 
cation of the meaning of the word cause which con 
fines it to the assemblage of positive conditions with 
out the negative then instead of unconditionally 
we must say subject to no other than negative

it is evident that from a limited number of un 
conditional sequences there will result a much greater 
number of conditional ones certain causes being 
given that is certain antecedents which are uncon

coexistence of these causes will give rise to an unli 
mited number of additional uniformities if two 
causes exist together the effects of both wdll exist 
together and if many causes coexist these causes by 
what we shall term hereafter the intermixture of their 
laws will give rise to new effects accompanying or 
succeeding one another in some particular order 
which order will be invariable while the causes con 
tinue to coexist but no longer the motion of the 
earth in a given orbit round the sun is a series of 
changes which follow one another as antecedents and 
consequents and will continue to do so while the suns 
attraction and the force with which the earth tends to 
advance in a direct line through space continue to 
coexist in the same quantities as at present but 
vary either of these causes and the unvarjring succes

of the earths motions therefore though a case of 
sequence invariable within the limits of human expe

problem of induction and is one of those questions 
the principles of the solution of which will it is to be 
hoped result from the inquiry we have undertaken 

 does a cause always stand with its effect in 
the relation of antecedent and consequent do we 
not often say of two simultaneous facts that they are 
cause and effect — as when we say that fire is the 
cause of warmth the sun and moisture the cause of 
vegetation and the like it is certain that a cause 
does not necessarily perish because its effect has been 
produced the two therefore do very generally 
coexist and there are some appearances and some 
common expressions seeming to imply not only that 
causes may but that they must be contemporaneous 
with their effects cessante causdy cessat et effecttis 
has been a dogma of the schools the necessity for 
the continued existence of the cause in order to the 
continuance of the effect seems to have been once a 
general doctrine among philosophers mr whewell 
observes that keplers numerous attempts to account 
for the motion of the heavenly bodies on mechanical 
principles were rendered abortive by his always sup 
posing that the force which set those bodies in motion 
must continue to operate in order to keep up the 
motion which it at first produced yet there were at 
all times many familiar instances in open contradiction

the solution of these difficulties will be foimd in 
a very simple distinction the conditions which are 
necessary for the first production of a phenomenon 
are occasionally also necessary for its continuance 
but more commonly its continuance requires no con 
dition except negative ones most things once pro 
duced continue as they are until something changes 
or destroys them but some require the permanent 
presence of the agencies which produced them at first 
these may if we please be considered as instanta 
neous phenomena requiring to be renewed at each 
instant by the cause by which they were at first gene 
rated accordingly the illumination of any given 
point of space has always been looked upon as an 
instantaneous fact which perishes and is perpetually 
renewed as long as the necessary conditions subsist 
if we adopt this language we are enabled to avoid 
admitting that the continuance of the cause is ever 
required to maintain the effect we may say it is

of the conditions which produced an effect is necessary 
to the continuance of the effect 

as to the ulterior question whether it is strictly 
necessary that the cause or assemblage of conditions 
should precede by ever so short an instant the pro 
duction of the effect a question raised and argued 
with much ingenuity by a writer from whom we have 
quoted we think the inquiry an unimportant one 
there certainly are cases in which the effect follows 
without any interval perceptible to our faculties and 
when there is an interval we cannot tell by how many 
intermediate links imperceptible to us that interval may 
really be filled up but even granting that an effect 
may commence simultaneously with its cause the view 
i have taken of causation is in noway practically affected 
whether the cause and its effect be necessarily suc 
cessive or not causation is still the law of the succes 
sion of phenomena everything which begins to 
exist must have a cause what does not begin to exist 
does not need a cause what causation has to account 
for is the origin of phenomena and all the successions 
of phenomena must be resolvable into causation 
these are the axioms of our doctrine if these be 
granted we can afford though t see no necessity 
for doing so to drop the words antecedent and con 
sequent as applied to cause and effect i have no 
objection to define a cause the assemblage of pheno 
mena which occurring some other phenomenon inva 
riably commences or has its origin whether the 
effect coincides in point of time with or immediately 
follows the hindmost of its conditions is immaterial 
at all events it does not precede it and when we are 
in doubt between two coexistent phenomena which

 it continually happens that several different 
phenomena which are not in the slightest degree 
dependent or conditional upon one another are found 
all to depend as the phrase is upon one and the same 
agent in other words one and the same phenomenon 
is seen to be followed by several sorts of effects quite 
heterogeneous but which go on simultaneously one 
with another provided of course that all other con 
ditions requisite for each of them also exist thus 
the sun produces the celestial motions it produces 
dayught and it produces heat the earth causes the 
fall of heavy bodies and it also in its capacity of an 
immense magnet causes the phenomena of the mag 
netic needle a crystal of galena causes the sensa 
tions of hardness of weight of cubical form of grey 
colour and many others between which we can trace 
no interdependence the purpose to which the phra 
seology of properties and powers is specially adapted 
is the expression of this sort of cases when the 
same phenomenon is followed either subject or not to 
the presence of other conditions by effects of different 
and dissimilar orders it is usual to say that each dif 
ferent sort of effect is produced by a different property 
of the cause thus we distinguish the attractive or 
gravitative property of the earth and its magnetic 
property the gravitative luminiferous and caloric 
properties of the sun the colour shape weight and 
hardness of the crystal these are mere phrases 
which explain nothing and add nothing to our know

they are a very powerful instrument of abridgment 
and of that acceleration of the process of thought 
which abridgment accomplishes 

this class of considerations leads us to a con 
ception which we shall find of great importance in 
the interpretation of nature that of a permanent 
cause or original natural agent there exist in 
nature a number of permanent causes which have 
subsisted ever since the human race has been in 
existence and for an indefinite and probably enormous 
length of time previous the sun the earth and 
planets with their various constituents air water and 
the other distinguishable substances whether simple 
or compound of which nature is made up are such 
permanent causes these have existed and the 
effects or consequences which they were fitted to pro 
duce have taken place as often as the other condi 
tions of the production met from the very beginning of 
our experience but we can give scientifically speak 
ing no account of the origin of the permanent causes 
themselves why these particular natural agents 
existed originally and no others or why they are 
commingled in such and such proportions and dis 
tributed in such and such a manner throughout space 
is a question we cannot answer more than this we 
can discover nothing regular in the distribution itself 
we can reduce it to no uniformity to no law there 
are no means by which from the distribution of these 
causes or agents in one part of space we could conjec 
ture whether a similar distribution prevails in another 
the coexistence therefore of primeval causes ranks 
to us among merely casual concurrences and all those 
sequences or coexistences among the effects of several 
such causes which though invariable while those

causation or laws of nature we can only calculate 
upon finding these sequences or coexistences where we 
know by direct evidence that the natural agents on 
the properties of which they ultimately depend are 
distributed in the requisite manner these perma 
nent causes are not always objects they are some 
times events that is to say periodical cycles of events 
that being the only mode in which events can possess 
the property of permanence not only for instance 
is the earth itself a permanent cause or primitive 
natural agent but the earths rotation is so too it is 
a cause which has produced from the earliest period 
by the aid of other necessary conditions the succes 
sion of day and night the ebb and flow of the sea 
and many other effects while as we can assign no 
eause except conjecturally for the rotation itself it 
is entitled to be ranked as a primeval cause it is 
however only the origin of the rotation which is 
mysterious to us once begun its continuance is 
¦accounted far by the first law of motion that of the 
permanence of rectilineal motion once impressed 
combined with the gravitation of the parts of the

effects but these must in all cases be a mere result 
either of the identity or of the coexistence of their 
causes if the causes did not coexist neither could 
the effects and these causes being also effects of 
prior causes and these of others until we reach the 
primeval causes it follows that except in the case of 
effects which can be traced immediately or remotely 
to one and the same cause the coexistences of pheno 
mena can in no case be universal unless the coexist 
ences of the primeval causes to which the effects are 
ultimately traceable can be reduced to an universal 
law but we have seen that they cannot there are 
accordingly no original and independent in other 
words no unconditional uniformities of coexistence 
between effects of different causes if they coexist it 
is only because the causes have casually coexisted 
the only independent and unconditional coexistences 
which are sufficiently invariable to have any claim to 
the character of laws are between different and 
mutually independent effects of the same cause in 
other words between different properties of the same 
natural agent this portion of the laws of nature 
will be treated of in the latter part of the present 
book under the name of the specific properties of 
kinds 

 before concluding this chapter it seems 
desirable to take notice of an apparent but not a real 
opposition between the doctrines which i have laid 
down respecting causation and those maintained in a 
work which i hold to be far the greatest yet produced 
on the philosophy of the sciences m comtes cours

first principle that the causes of phenomena are

beyond the reach of the human faculties and that att 
which is accessible to us is their laws or as he ex 
plains the term their constant relations of succession 
or of similarity accordingly m comte sedulously 
abstains in the subsequent part of his work from the 
use of the word cause an example which i have not 
followed for reasons which i will proceed to state 
i most fully agree with m comte that ultimate or in 
the phraseology of metaphysicians efficient causes 
which are conceived as not being phenomena nor per 
ceptible by the senses at all are radically inaccessible 
to the human faculties and that the constant 
relations of succession or of similarity which exist 
among phenomena themselves not forgetting so far 
as any constancy can be traced their relations of 
coexistence are the only subjects of rational investi 
gation when i speak of causation i have nothing 
in view other than those constant relations but i 
think the terms causation and cause and effect 
important to be preserved for the purpose of dis 
tinctively designating one class of those relations 
namely the relations of succession which so far as 
we know are unconditional as contrasted with those 
which uke the succession of day and night depend 
upon the existence or upon the coexistence of other 
antecedent facts this distinction corresponds to the 
great division which mr whewell and other writers 
have made of the field of science into the investigation 
of what they term the laws of phenomena and the 
investigation of causes a phraseology as i conceive 
altogether vicious inasmuch as the ascertainment of 
causes such causes as the human faculties can ascer 
tain namely causes which are themselves phenomena 
is therefore merely the ascertainment of other and 
more universal laws of phenomena and i cannot

but look upon the revival on english soil ot the 
doctrine not only refuted by the school of locke and 
hume but given up by their great rivals reid and 
stewart that efficient causes are within the reach of 
human knowledge as a remarkable instance of what 
has been aptly called the peculiar zest which the 
spirit of reaction against modem tendencies gives to 
ancient absurdities 

yet the distinction between those constant rela 
tions of succession or coexistence which mr whe 
well terms laws of phenomena and those which 
he terms as i do laws of causation is grounded 
however incorrectly expressed upon a real diflference 
it is no doubt with great injustice that mr whewell 
who has evidently gven only a most partial and 
cursory inspection to m comtes work assumes that 
m comte has overlooked this fundamental distinction 
and that by excluding the investigation of causes he 
excludes that of all the most general truths no one 
really acquainted with m comtes admirable specu 
lations could have so completely misapprehended their 
whole spirit and purport but it does appear to me 
that his disinclination to employ the word cause has 
occasionally led him to attach less importance than it 
deserves to this great distinction upon which alone 
i am convinced the possibility rests of framing a 
rigorous canon of induction nor do i see what is 
gained by avoiding this particular word when m 
comte is forced like other people to speak continually 
of the properties of things of agents and their action 
of forces and the like terms equally liable to per 
version and which are partial and inadequate expres 
sions for what no word that we possess except cause 
expresses in its full generality i believe too that

chapter vi 
op the composition op causes 

 to complete the general notion of causation 
on which the rules of experimental inquiry into the 
laws of nature must be founded one distinction still 
remains to be pointed out a distinction so funda 
mentaly and of so much importance as to require a 
chapter to itself 

the preceding discussions have rendered us fami 
liar with the case in which several agents or causes 
concur as conditions to the production of an effect a 
case in truths almost universal there being very few 
effects to the production of which no more than one 
agent contributes suppose then that two different 
agents operating jointly are fpuowed under a certain 
set of collateral conditions by a given efiect k either 
of these agents instead of being joined with the 
other had operated alone under the same set of condi 
tions in all other respects some effect would probably 
have followed which would have been different from 
the joint effect of the two and more or less dissimilar 
to it now if we happen to know what would be the 
effects of each cause when acting separately from the 
other we are often able to arrive deductively or d 
priori j at a correct prediction of what will arise from 
their conjunct agency to enable us to do this it is 
only necessary that the same law which expresses the 
effect of each cause acting by itself shall also cor 
rectly express the part due to that cause of the effect 
which ouows from the two together this con 
dition is realised in the extensive and important

class of phenomena commonly called mechanical 
namely the phenomena of the communication of 
motion or of pressure which is tendency to motion 
from one body to another in this important class 
of cases of causation one cause never properly 
speaking defeats or frustrates another both have their 
full effect if a body is propelled in two directions by 
two forces one tending to drive it to the north and 
the other to the east it is caused to move in a given 
time exactly as far in both directions as the two forces 
would separately have carried it and is left precisely 
where it would have arrived if it had been acted upon 
first by one of the two forces and afterwards by the 
other this law of nature is called in mechanical 
philosophy the principle of the composition of forces 
and in imitation of that wellchosen expression i shall 
give the name of the composition of causes to the 
principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the 
joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum 
of their separate effects 

this principle however by no means prevails in 
all departments of the field of nature the chemical 
combination of two substances produces as is well 
known a third substance with properties entirely 
different from those of either of the two substances 
separately or of both of them taken together not a 
trace of the properties of hydrogen or of oxygen is 
observable in those of their compound water the 
taste of sugar of lead is not the sum of the tastes of 
its component elements acetic acid and lead or its 
oxide nor is the colour of green vitriol a mixture of 
the colours of sulphuric acid and copper this explains 
why mechanics is a deductive or demonstrative science 
and chemistry not in the one we can compute the 
effects of all combiuations of causes whether real or

hypothetical from the laws which we know to govern 
those causes when acting separately because they 
continue to observe the same laws when in combina 
tion which they observed when separate whatever 
would have happened in consequence of each cause 
taken by itself happens when they are together 
and we have only to cast up the results not so 
in the phenomena which are the peculiar subject of 
the science of chemistry there most of the unifor 
mities to which the causes conformed when separate 
cease altogether when they are conjoined and we are 
not at least in the present state of our knowledge 
able to foresee what result will follow from any new 
combination until we have tried it by specific expe 
riment 

k this be true of chemical combinations it is still 
more true of those far more complex combinations of 
elements which constitute organised bodies and in 
which those extraordinary new uniformities arise 
which are called the laws of life all organised 
bodies are composed of parts similar to those 
composing inorganic nature and which have even 
themselves existed in an inorganic state but the 
phenomena of life which result from the juxtaposition 
of those parts in a certain manner bear no analogy to 
any of the effects which would be produced by the 
action of the component substances considered as 
mere physical agents to whatever degree we might 
imagine our knowledge of the properties of the several 
ingredients of a living body to be extended and per 
fected it is certain that no mere summing up of the 
separate actions of those elements will ever amount to 
the action of the living body itself the tongue for 
instance is like all other parts of the animal frame 
composed of gelatine fibrin and other products of the

chemistry of digestion but from no knowledge of the 
properties of those substances could we ever predict 
that it could taste unless gelatine or fibrin could 
themselves taste for no elementary fact can be 
in the conclusion which was not first in the pre 
misses 

there are thus two difierent modes of the conjunct 
 action of causes from which arise two modes of con 
flict or mutual interference between laws of nature 
suppose at a given point of time and space two or 
more causes which if they acted separately would 
produce efiects contrary or at least conflicting with 
each other one of them tending to undo wholly or 
partially what the other tends to do thus the expan 
sive force of the gases generated by the ignition of 
gunpowder tends to project a bullet towards the sky 
while its gravity tends to make it fiall to the ground 
a stream running into a reservoir at one end tends to 
fill it higher and higher while a drain at the other 
extremity tends to empty it now in such cases as 
these even if the two causes which are in joint action 
exactly annul one another still the laws of both are 
fulfilled the efiect is the same as if the drain had 
been open for half an hour first and the stream had 
flowed in for as long afterwards each agent pro 
duced the same amount of effect as if it had acted 
separately though the contrary effect which was 
taking place during the same time obliterated it as 
fast as it was produced here then we have two 
causes producing by their joint operation an effect 



 i omit for simplicity to take into account the effect in this 
latter case of the diminution of pressure in diminishing the flow of 
the water through the drain which evidently in no way affects the 
truth or applicability of the principle

composition of causes 

which at first seems quite dissimilar to those which 
they produce separately but which on examination 
proves to be really the sum of those separate effects 
it will be noticed that we here enlarge the idea of 
the sum of two effects so as to include what is com 
monly called their difference but which is in reauty 
the result of the addition of opposites a conception 
to which as is well known mankind are indebted for 
that admirable extension of the algebraical calculus 
which has so vastly increased its powers as an instru 
ment of discovery by introducing into its reasonings 
with the sign of subtraction prefixed and under the 
name of negative quantities every description what 
ever of positive phenomena provided they are of such 
a quality in reference to those previously introduced 
that to add the one is equivalent to subtracting an 
equal quantity of the other 

there is then one mode of the mutual inter 
ference of laws of nature in which even when the 
concurrent causes annihilate each others effects each 
exerts its full efficacy according to its own law its 
law as a separate agent but in the other description 
of cases the two agencies which are brought together 
cease entirely and a totally different set of phenomena 
arise as in the experiment of two liquids which 
when mixed in certain proportions instantly become 
a solid mass instead of merely a larger amount of 
liquid 

§ this difference between the case in which the 
joint effect of causes is the sum of their separate effects 
and the case in which it is heterogeneous to them 
between laws which work together without alteration 
and laws which when called upon to work toge 
ther cease and give place to others is one of the

fundamental distinctions in nature the former case 
that of the composition of causes is the general one 
the other is always special and exceptional there 
are no objects which do not as to some of their phe 
nomena obey the principle of the composition of 
causes none that have not some laws which are 
rigidly fulfilled in every combination into which the 
objects enter the weight of a body for instance is 
a property which it retains in all the combinations in 
which it is placed the weight of a chemical com 
pound or of an organized body is equal to the sum 
of the weights of the elements which compose it 
the weight either of the elements or of the compound 
will vary if they be carried farther from their centre 
of attraction or brought nearer to it but whatever 
affects the one affects the other they always re 
main precisely equal so again the component parts 
of a vegetable or animal substance do not lose their 
mechanical and chemical properties as separate agents 
when by a peculiar mode of juxtaposition they as 
an aggregate whole acquire physiological or vital pro 
perties in addition those bodies continue as before 
to obey mechanical and chemical laws in so far as the 
operation of those laws is not counteracted by the 
new laws which govern them as organized beings 
when in short a concurrence of causes takes place 
which calls into action new laws bearing no analogy 
to any that we can trace in the separate operation of 
the causes the new laws may supersede one portion 
of the previous laws but coexist with another portion 
and may even compound the effect of those previous 
laws with their own 

again laws which were themselves generated in 
the second mode may generate others in the first

and physiology owe their existence to a breach of the 
principle of composition of causes it does not follow 
that these pecuhar or as they might be termed 
heteropathic laws are not capable of composition with 
one another the causes which by one combination 
have had their laws altered may carry their new laws 
with them unaltered into their ulterior combinations 
and hence there is no reason to despair of ultimately 
raising chemistry and physiology to the condition of 
deductive sciences for though it is impossible to 
deduce all chemical and physiological truths from the 
laws or properties of simple substances or elementary 
agents they may probably be deducible from laws 
which commence when these elementary agents are 
brought together into some moderate number of not 
very complex combinations the laws of life will 
never be deducible from the mere laws of the ingre 
dients but the prodigiously complex facts of life may 
all be deducible from comparatively simple laws of 
life which laws depending indeed upon combinations 
but upon comparatively simple combinations of ante 
cedents may in more complex circumstances be 
strictly compoimded with one another and with the 
physical and chemical laws of the ingredients the 
details of the vital phenomena even now afford innu 
merable exemplifications of the composition of causes 
and in proportion as these phenomena are more accu 
rately studied there appears more and more reason 
to believe that the same laws which operate in the 
simpler combinations of circumstances do in fact 
continue to be observed in the more complex this

will be found equally true in the phenomena of mind 
and even in social and political phenomena the result 
of the laws of mind it is in the case of chemical 
phenomena that the least progress has yet been made 
in bringing the special laws under general ones from 
which they may be deduced but there are even in 
chemistry many circumstances to encourage the hope 
that such general laws will hereafter be discovered 
the diflferent actions of a chemical compound will 
never undoubtedly be found to be the sum of the 
actions of its separate elements but there may exist be

elements some constant relation which if discover 
able by a sufficient induction would enable us to

composition of causes 

and in respect to quality we have already some par 
tial generalizations sufficient to indicate the possibility 
of ultimately proceeding further we can predicate 
many common properties of the kind of compounds 
which result from the combination in each of the 
small number of possible proportions of any acid 
whatever with any base we have also the very 
curious law discovered by berthollet that two 
soluble salts mutually decompose one another when 
ever the new combinations which result produce an 
insoluble compound or one less soluble than the two 
former another uniformity has been observed com 
monly called the law of isomorphism the identity of 
the crystauine forms of substances which possess in 
common certain pecuuarities of chemical composition 
thus it appears that even heteropathic laws such 
laws of combined agency as are not compounded of 
the laws of the separate agencies are yet at least in 
some cases derived from them according to a fixed 
principle there may therefore be laws of the gene 
ration of laws from others dissimilar to them and in 
chemistry these undiscovered laws of the dependence 
of the properties of the compound on the properties of 
its elements may together with the laws of the ele 
ments themselves furnish the premisses by which the 
science is destined one day to be rendered deductive 

it would seem therefore that there is no class of 
phenomena in which the composition of causes does 
not obtain that as a generd rule causes in combina 
tion produce exactly the same effects as when acting 
singly but that this rule though general is not 
universal that in some instances at some particular 
points in the transition from separate to united action 
the laws change and an entirely new set of effects are 
either added to or take the place of those which

arise from the separate agency of the same causes

of composition to an indefinite extent like the laws 
which they superseded 

§ that effects are proportional to their causes 
is laid down by some writers as an axiom in the 
theory of causation and great use is sometimes made 
of this principle in reasonings respecting the laws of 
nature although it is incumbered with many difficul 
ties and apparent exceptions which much ingenuity 
has been expended in showing not to be real ones 
this proposition in so far as it is true enters as a 
particular case into the general principle of the com 
position of causes the causes compounded being in 
this instance homogeneous in which case if in any 
their joint effect might be expected to be identical 
with the sum of their separate effects k a force 
equal to one hundred weight will raise a certain body 
along an inclined plane a force equal to two himdred 
weight will we know raise two bodies exactly similar 
and thus the effect is proportional to the cause but 
does not a force equal to two hundred weight actually 
contain in itself two forces each equal to one hundred 
weight which if employed apart would separately 
raise the two bodies in question the fact therefore 
that when exerted jointly they raise both bodies at once 
results from the composition of causes and is a mere 
instance of the general fact that mechanical forces are 
subject to the law of composition and so in every 
other case which can be supposed for the doctrine 
of the proportionality of effects to their causes cannot 
of course be applicable to cases in which the augmen 
tation of the cause alters the kind of effect that is 
in which the surplus quantity superadded to the cause

composition of causes 

does not become compounded with it but the two 
together generate an altogether new phenomenon 
suppose that the application of a certain quantity of 
heat to a body merely increases its bulk that a double 
quantity melts it and a triple quantity decomposes 
it these three effects being heterogeneous no ratio 
whether corresponding or not to that of the quantities 
of heat applied can be established between them 
thus we see that the supposed axiom of the pro 
portionality of effects to their causes fails at the 
precise point where the principle of the composi 
tion of causes also fails viz where the concur 
rence of causes is such as to determine a change in 
the properties of the body generally and render it 
subject to new laws more or less dissimilar to those 
to which it conformed in its previous state of exist 
ence the recognition therefore of any such law of 
proportionality is superseded by the more compre 
hensive principle in which as much of it as is true is 
implicitly asserted 

the general remarks on causation which seemed 
necessary as an introduction to the theory of the 
inductive process may here terminate that process 
is essentially an inquiry into cases of causation all 
the uniformities which exist in the succession of phe 
nomena and most of those which prevail in their 
coexistence are either as we have seen themselves 
laws of causation or consequences resulting from and 
corollaries capable of being deduced from such laws 
if we could determine what causes are correctly as 
signed to what effects and what effects to what 
causes we should be virtually acquainted with the 
whole course of nature all those uniformities which 
are mere rejsults of causation might then be explained 
and accounted for and every individual fact or event 

igize by google 



 induction 

might be predicted provided we had the requisite 
data that is the requisite knowledge of the circum 
stances which in the particular instance preceded it 

to ascertain therefore what are the laws of cau 
sation which exist in nature to determine the effects 
of every cause and the causes of all effects — is the 
main business of induction and to point out how 
 this is done is the chief object of inductive logic

chapter vii 
of observation and experiment 

 it results from the preceding exposition that 
the process of ascertaining what consequents in nature 
are invariably connected with what antecedents or 
in other words what phenomena are related to each 
other as causes and effects is in some sort a process of 
analysis that every fact which begins to exist has 
a cause and that this cause must be found some 
where among the facts which immediately preceded 
its occurrence may be taken for certain the whole 
of the present facts are the infallible result of all past 
facts and more immediately of all the facts which 
existed at the moment previous here then is a 
great sequence which we know to be uniform if 
the whole prior state of the entire universe could 
again recur it would again be followed by the whole 
present state the question is how to resolve this 
complex uniformity into the simpler uniformities which 
compose it and assign to each portion of the vast 
antecedent that portion of the consequent which is 
attendant upon it 

this operation which we have called analytical 
inasmuch as it is the resolution of a complex whole 
into the component elements is more than a merely 
mental analysis no mere contemplation of the phe 
nomena and partition of them by the intellect alone 
will of itself accompush the end we have now in view 
nevertheless such a mental partition is an indispen 
sable first step the order of nature as perceived at 
a first glance presents at every instant a chaos followed 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

by another chaos we must decompose each chaos 
into single facts we must learn to see in the chaotic 
antecedent a multitude of distinct antecedents in the 
chaotic consequent a multitude of distinct conse 
quents this supposing it done will not of itself 
tell us on which of the antecedents each consequent is 
invariably attendant to determine that point we 
must endeavour to effect a separation of the facts 
from one another not in our minds only but in 
nature the mental analysis however must take 
place first and every one knows that in the mode of 
performing it one intellect differs immensely from 
another it is the essence of the act of observing 
for the observer is not he who merely sees the thing 
which is before his eyes but he who sees what parts 
that thing is composed of to do this well is a rare 
talent one person from inattention or attending 
only in the wrong place overiooks half of what he 
sees another sets down much more than he sees 
confounding it with what he imagines or with what 
he infers another takes note of the kind of all the 
circumstances but being inexpert in estimating their 
degree leaves the quantity of each vague and uncer 
tain another sees indeed the whole but makes such 
an awkward division of it into parts throwing things 
into one mass which require to be separated and 
separating others which might more conveniently be 
considered as one that the result is much the same 
sometimes even worse than if no analysis had been 
attempted at all it would be possible to point out 
what qualities of mind and modes of mental culture 
fit a person for being a good observer that however 
is a question not of logic but of the theory of educa 
tion in the most enlarged sense of the term there 
is not properly an art of observing there may

observation and experiment 

be rules for observing but these like rules for 
inventing are properly instructions for the prepara 
tion of ones own mind for putting it into the state 
in which it will be most fitted to observe or most 
likely to invent they are therefore essentially 
rules of selfeducation which is a different thing 
from logic they do not teach how to do the thing 
but how to make ourselves capable of doing it they 
are an art of strengthening the limbs not an art of 
using them 

the extent and minuteness of observation which 
may be requisite and the degree of decomposition to 
which it may be necessary to carry the mental ana 
lysis depend upon the particular purpose in view 
to ascertain the state of the whole universe at any 
particular moment is impossible but would also be 
useless in making chemical experiments we should 
not think it necessary to note the position of the 
planets because experience has shown as a very 
superficial experience is sufficient to show that in 
such cases that circumstance is not material to the 
result and accordingly in the age when men believed 
in the occult influences of the heavenly bodies it 
might have been imphilosophical to omit ascertaining 
the precise condition of those bodies at the moment of 
the experiment as to the degree of minuteness of 
the mental subdivision if we were obliged to break 
down what we observe into its very simplest elements 
that is uterally into single facts it would be difficult 
to say where we should find them we can hardly 
ever affirm that our divisions of any kind have reached 
the ultimate unit but this too is fortunately unne 
cessary the only object of the mental separation is 
to suggest the requisite physical separation so that 
we may either accomplish it ourselves or seek for it 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

in nature and we have done enough when we have 
carried the subdivision as far as the point at which 
we are able to see what observations or experiments 
we require it is only essential at whatever point our 
mental decomposition of facts may for the present 
have stopped that we should hold ourselves ready 
and able to carry it farther as occasion requires and 
should not allow the freedom of onr discriminating 
faculty to be imprisoned by the swathes and bands of 
ordinary classification as was the case with all early 
speculative inquirers not excepting the greeks to 
whom it hardly ever occurred that what was called 
by one abstract name might in reality be several 
phenomena or that there was a possibility of decom 
posing the facts of the universe into any elements 
but those which ordinary language already recog 
nised 

§ the different antecedents and consequents 
being then supposed to be so far as the case 
requires ascertained and discriminated from one 
another we are to inquire which is connected with 
which in every instance which comes under our 
observation there are many antecedents and many 
consequents if those antecedents could not be 
severed from one another except in thought or if 
those consequents never were found apart it would 
be impossible for us to distinguish ct posteriori at 
least the real laws or to assign to any cause its 
effect or to any effect its cause to do so we must 
be able to meet with some of the antecedents apart 
from the rest and observe what follows from them 
or some of the consequents and observe by what they 
are preceded we must in short follow the baco 
nian rule of varying the circumstances this is indeed 

digitized by vjooq ic 



observation and experiment 

only the first rule of physical inquiry and not as 
some have thought the sole rule but it is the foun 
dation of all the rest 

for the purpose of varying the circumstances we 
may have recourse according to a distinction com 
monly made either to observation or to experiment 
we may either find an instance in nature suited to 
our purposes or by an artificial arrangement of cir 
cumstances make one the value of the instance 
depends upon what it is in itself not upon the mode 
in which it is obtained its employment for the pur 
poses of induction depends upon the same principles 
in the one case and in the other as the uses of money 
are the same whether it is inherited or acquired 
there is in short no diflference in kind no real 
logical distinction between the two processes of 
investigation there are however practical distinc 
tions to which it is of considerable importance to 
advert 

§ the first and most obvious distinction 
between observation and experiment is that the 
latter is an immense extension of the former it not 
only enables us to produce a much greater number of 
variations in the circumstances than nature sponta 
neously oflfers but moreover in thousands of cases 
to produce the precise sort of variation which we 
are in want of for discovering the law of the pheno 
menon a service which nature being constructed on 
a quite difierent scheme from that of facilitating our 
studies is seldom so friendly as to bestow upon us 
for example in order to ascertain what principle 
in the atmosphere enables it to sustain ufe the 
variation we require is that a living animal should be 
immersed in each component element of the atmo

sphere separately but nature does not supply either 
oxygen or azote in a separate state we are indebted 
to artificial experiment for our knowledge that it is 
the former and not the latter which supports respi 
ration and even for our knowledge of the very 
existence of the two ingredients 

thus far the advantage of experimentation over 
simple observation is universally recognised all are 
aware that it enables us to obtain innumerable combi 
nations of circumstances which are not to be found in 
nature and so add to natures experiments a multitude 
of experiments of our own but there is another 
superiority or as bacon would have expressed it 
another prerogative of instances artificially obtained 
over spontaneous instances — of our own experiments 
over even the same experiments when made by 
nature — which is not of less importance and which 
is far from being felt and acknowledged in the same 
degree 

when we can produce a phenomenon artificially 
we can take it as it were home with us and observe 
it in the midst of circumstances with which in all 
other respects we are accurately acquainted k we 
desire to know what are the effects of the cause a 
and are able to produce a by any means at our dis 
posal we can generally determine at our own discre 
tion so far as is compatible with the nature of the 
phenomenon a the whole of the circumstances which 
shall be present along with it and thus knowing 
exactly the simultaneous state of everything else 
which is within the reach of as influence we have 
only to observe what alteration is made in that state 
by the presence of a 

for example by the electrical machine we can 
produce in the midst of known circumstances the

observation and experiment 

phenomena which nature exhibits on a grander scale 
under the forni of lightning and thunder now let 
any one consider what amount of knowledge of the 
eflfects and laws of electric agency mankind could 
ever have obtained from the mere observation of 
thunderstorms and compare it with that which they 
have gained and may expect to gain from electrical 
and galvanic experiments this example is the more 
striking now that we have reason to believe that elec 
tric action is of all natural pheliomena except heat 
the most pervading and universal which therefore it 
might antecedently have been supposed could stand 
least in need of artificial means of production to 
enable it to be studied while the fact is so much the 
contrary that without the electric machine the voltaic 
battery and the leyden jar we should never have 
suspected the existence of electricity as one of the 
great agents in nature the few electric phenomena 
we should have known of would have continued to be 
regarded either as supernatural or as a sort of anoma 
lies and eccentricities in the order of the universe 

when we have succeeded in insulating the pheno 
menon which is the subject of inquiry by placing it 
among known circumstances we may produce further 
variations of circumstances to any extent and of such 
kinds as we think best calculated to bring the laws of 
the phenomenon into a clear light by introducing 
one well defined circumstance after another into the 
experiment we obtain assurance of the manner in 
which the phenomenon behaves under an indefinite 
variety of possible circumstances thus chemists 
after having obtained some newlydiscovered sub 
stance in a pure state that is having made sure that 
there is nothing present which can interfere with and 
modify its agency introduce various other substances

one by one to ascertain whether it will combine with 
them or decompose them and with what result and 
also apply heat or electricity or pressure to discover 
what will happen to the substance under each of these 
circumstances 

but if on the other hand it is out of our power 
to produce the phenomenon and we have to seek for 
instances in which nature produces it the task before 
us is one of quite another kind instead of being 
able to choose what the concomitant circumstances 
shall be we now have to discover what they are 
which when we go beyond the simplest and most 
accessible cases it is next to impossible to do with 
any precision and completeness let us take as an 
exemplification of a phenomenon which we have no 
means of fabricating artificially a human mind nature 
produces many but the consequence of our not being 
able to produce it by art is that in every instance in 
which we see a human mind developing itself or 
acting upon other things we see it surrounded and 
obscured by an indefinite multitude of unascertainable 
circumstances rendering the use of the common expe 
rimental methods almost delusive we may conceive 
to what extent this is true if we consider among other 
things that whenever nature produces a human mind 
she produces in close connexion with it also a body 
that is a vast complication of physical facts in no 
two cases perhaps exactly similar and most of which 
except the mere structure which we can examine in 
a sort of coarse way after it has ceased to act are 
radically out of the reach of our means of exploration 
if instead of a human mind we suppose the subject 
of investigation to be a human society or state all 
the same difficulties recur in a greatly augmented 
degree

observation and experiment 

we have thus already come within sight of a 
conclusion which the progress of the inquiry will i 
think bring before us with the clearest evidence 
namely that in the sciences which deal with pheno 
mena in which artificial experiments are impossible 
as in the case of astronomy or in which they have a 
very limited range as in physiology mental philo 
sophy and the social science induction from direct 
experience is practised at a disadvantage generally 
equivalent to impracticabiuty from which it follows 
that the methods of those sciences in order to accom 
push anything worthy of attainment must be to a 
great extent if not principally deductive this is 
already known to be the case with the first of the 
sciences we have mentioned astronomy that it is 
not generally recognised as true of the others is 
probably one of the reasons why they are still in 
their infancy but any further notice of this topic 
would at present be premature 

§ if what is called pure observation is at so 
great a disadvantage compared with artificial expe 
rimentation in one department of the direct explora 
tion of phenomena there is another branch in which 
the advantage is all on the side of the former 

inductive inquiry having for its object to ascertain 
what causes are connected with what efiects we may 
begin this search at either end of the road which 
leads from the one point to the other we may either 
inquire into the efiects of a given cause or into the 
causes of a given effect the fact that light blackens 
chloride of silver might have been discovered either 
by experiments upon ught trying what effect it would 
produce on various substances or by observing that 
portions of the chloride had repeatedly become black

and inquiring into the circumstances the effect of 
the urau poison might have become known either by 
administering it to animals or by examining how it 
happened that the wounds which the indians of 
guiana inflict with their arrows prove so uniformly 
mortal now it is manifest from the mere statement 
of the examples without any theoretical discussion 
that artificial experimentation is appucable only to 
the former of these modes of investigation we can 
take a cause and try what it will produce but we 
cannot take an eflfect and try what it will be produced 
by we can only watch till we see it produced or 
are enabled to produce it by accident 

this would be of httle importance if it always 
depended upon our choice from which of the two ends 
of the sequence we would undertake our inquiries 
but we have seldom any option as we can only travel 
from the known to the unknown we are obliged to 
commence at whichever end we are best acquainted 
with if the agent is more famiuar to us than its effects 
we watch for or contrive instances of the agent under 
such varieties of circumstances as are open to us and 
observe the result if on the contrary the conditions 
on which a phenomenon depends are obscure but the 
phenomenon itself familiar we must commence our 
inquiry from the effect if we are struck with the 
fact that chloride of silver has been blackened and 
have no suspicion of the cause we have no resource 
but to compare instances in which the fact has chanced 
to occur until by that comparison we discover that in 
all those instances the substance had been exposed to 
the ught if we knew nothing of the indian arrows 
but their fatal effect accident alone could turn our 
attention to experiments on the urau in the regular 
course of investigation we could only inquire or try

to observe what had been done to the arrows in par 
ticular instances 

wherever having nothing to guide us to the 
cause we are obliged to set out from the eflfect and 
to apply the rule of varying the circumstances to the 
consequents not the antecedents we are necessarily 
destitute of the resource of artificial experimentation 
we cannot at our choice obtain consequents as we 
can antecedents under any set of circumstances com 
patible with their nature there are no means of 
producing efiects but through their causes and by the 
supposition the causes of the eflfect in question are not 
known to us we have therefore no expedient but 
to study it where it oflfers itself spontaneously if 
nature happens to present us with instances sufls 
ciently varied in their circumstances and if we are 
able to discover either among the proximate ante 
cedents or among some other order of antecedents 
something which is always found when the eflfect is 
found however various the circumstances and never 
found when it is not we may discover by mere 
observation without experiment a real uniformity in 
nature 

but although this is certainly the most favourable 
case for sciences of pure observation as contrasted 
with those in which artificial experiments are possible 
there is in reality no case which more strikingly illus 
trates the inherent imperfection of direct induction 
when not founded upon experimentation suppose 
that by a comparison of cases of the eflfect we have 
found an antecedent which appears to be and perhaps 
is invariably connected with it we have not yet 
proved that antecedent to be the cause until we have 
reversed the process and produced the eflfect by 
means of that antecedent if we can produce the

 induction 

antecedent artificially and if when we do so the effect 
follows the induction is complete that antecedent is 
the cause of that consequent •• but we then have 
added the evidence of experiment to that of simple 
observation until we had done so we had only 
proved invariable antecedence but not unconditional 
antecedence or causation until it had been shown 
by the actual production of the antecedent under 
known circumstances and the occurrence thereupon 
of the consequent that the antecedent was really the 
condition on which it depended the uniformity of 
succession which was proved to exist between them 
might for aught we knew be uke the succession of 
day and night no case of causation at all both 
antecedent and consequent might be successive stages 
of the effect of an ulterior cause observation in 
short without experiment and without any aid from 
deduction can ascertain uniformities but cannot prove 
causation 

in order to see these remarks verified by the 
actual state of the sciences we have only to think 
of the condition of natural history in zoology for 
example there is an immense number of uniformities 
ascertained some of coexistence others of succession 
to many of which notwithstanding considerable varia 
tions of the attendant circumstances we know not 
any exception but the antecedents for the most 
part are such as we cannot artificially produce or 
if we can it is only by setting in motion the exact 



 unless indeed the consequent was generated not by the 
antecedent but by the means we employed to produce the ante 
cedent as however these means are under our power there is 
far a probability that they are also sufficiently within our knowledge 
to enable us to judge whether that could be the case or not

process by which nature produces them and this 
being to us a mysterious process of which the main 
circumstances are not only unknown but unobservable 
the name of experimentation would here be com 
pletely misapplied such are the facts and what is 
the result that on this vast subject which affords 
so much and such varied scope for observation we 
have not properly speaking ascertained a single 
cause a single unconditional miformity we know 
not in the case of almost any of the phenomena that 
we find conjoined which is the condition of the other 
which is cause and which effect or whether either of 
them is so or they are not rather all of them conjunct

of laws hitherto unknown 

although some of the foregoing observations may 
be in technical strictness of arrangement premature 
in this place it seemed that a few general remarks 
upon the diflerence between sciences of mere obser 
vation and sciences of experimentation and the 
extreme disadvantage under which directly inductive 
inquiry is necessarily carried on in the former were 
the best preparation for discussing the methods of 
direct induction a preparation rendering superfluous 
much that must otherwise have been introduced with 
some inconvenience into the heart of that discussion 
to the consideration of these methods we now

op the four methods of experimental 
inquiry 

 the simplest and most obvious modes of 
singling out from among the circumstances which 
precede or follow a phenomenon those mth which it 
is really connected by an invariable law are two in 
number one is by comparing together different 
instances in which the phenomenon occurs the 
other is by comparing instances in which the pheno 
menon does occur with instances in other respects 
similar in which it does not these two methods 
may be respectively denominated the method of 
agreement and the method of difference 

in illustrating these methods it will be necessary 
to bear in mind the twofold character of inquiries 
into the laws of phenomena which may be either 
inquiries into the cause of a given effect or into the 
effects or properties of a given cause we shall 
consider the methods in their appucation to either 
trder of investigation and shall draw our examples 
equally from both 

we shall denote antecedents by the large letters 
x the alphabet and the consequents corresponding to 
them by the small let a then be an agent or 
cause and let the object of our inquiry be to ascertain 
what are the effects of this cause if we can either 
find or produce the agent a in such varieties of 
circumstances that the different cases have no cir 
eumstance in common except a then whatever 
effect we find to be prpduced in all our trials must it

ould seem be the effect of a suppose for exam 
pie that a is tried along with b and c and that the 
effect is a c and suppose that a is next tried with 
d and e but without b and c and that the effect is 
ade then we may reason thus h and c are not 
effects of a for they were not produced by it in the 
second experiment nor are d and e for they were 
not produced in the first whatever is really the 
effect of a must have been produced in both instances 
now this condition is fulfilled by no circumstance 
except a the phenomenon a cannot have been the 
effect of b or c since it was produced where they 
were not nor of d or e since it was produced 
where they were not therefore it is the effect of a 
for example let the antecedent a be the contact 
of an alkaline substance and an oil this combination 
being tried under several varieties of circumstance 
resembling each other in nothing else the results agree 
in the production of a greasy and detersive or sapo 
naceous substance it is therefore concluded that the 
combination of an oil and an alkali causes the produc 
tion of a soap it is thus we inquire by the method 
of agreement into the effect of a given cause 

in a similar manner we may inquire into the cause 
of a given effect let a be the effecjt here as shown 
in the last chapter we have only the resource of observa 
tion without experiment we cannot take a phenomenon 
of which we know not the origin and try to find its 
mode of production by producing it if we succeeded 
in such a random trial it could only be by accident 
but if we can observe a in two different combinations 
ibc and ade and if we know or can discover that 
the antecedent circumstjmces in these cases respec 
tively were abc and ade we may conclude by a 
reasoning similar to that in the preceding example

 tnduction 

thdt a is the antecedent connected with the conse 
quent a by a law of causation b and o we may say 
cannot be causes of a since on its seeond occurrence 
they were not present nor are d and e for they 
were not present on its first occurrence a alone oi 
the fire circumstances was found among the antece 
dents of a in both instances 

for example let the efiect a be crystallization 
we compare instances in which bodies are known to 
assume crystalline structure but which have no other 
point of agreement and we find them to have one 
and as far as we can observe only one antecedent in 
common the deposition of a solid matter from a 
liquid state either a state of fusion or of solution 
we conclude therefore that the solidification of a 
substance from a liquid state is an invariable ante 
cedent of its crystallization 

in this example we may go fardier and say it is 
not only the invariable antecedent but the cause 
for in this case we are able after detecting the ante 
cedent a to produce it artificially and by finding 
that a follows it verify the result of our induction 
the importance of thus reversing the proof was never 
more strikingly manifested than when by keeping a 
phial of water charged with siliceous particles undis 
turbed for years a chemist i believe dr wouaston 
succeeded in obtaining crystals of quartz and in the 
equally interesting experiment in which sir james 
hall produced artificial marble by the cocking of its 
materials from fusion imder immense preasaare two 
admirable examples of the light which may be thrown 
upon the most secret processes of nature by wellccm 
trived interrogation of her 

but if we cannot artificially produce the phenome

the four experimental methods 

subject to very considerable doubt thougb an inva 
riable it may not be the unconditional antecedent of 
a but may precede it as day precedes night or night 
day this uncertainty arises from the impossibility 
of assuring ourselves that a is the only immediate 
antecedent common to both the instances if we 
could be certain of having ascertaiqed all the inva 
riable antecedents we might be sure that the uncon 
ditional invariable antecedent or cause must be found 
somewhere among them unfortunately it is hardly 
ever possible to ascertain all the antecedents unless 
the phenomenon is one which we can produce artifi 
cially even then the difisculty is merely lightened not 
removed men knew how to raise water in pumps long 
before they adverted to what was really the operating 
circumstance in the means they employed namely the 
pressure of the atmosphere on the open surface of the 
water it is however much easier to analyze com 
pletely a set of arrangements made by ourselves than 
the whole complex mass of the agencies which nature 
happens to be exerting at the moment when she pro 
duces any given phenomenon we may overlook 
some of the material circumstances in an experiment 
with an electrical machine but we shall at the worst 
be better acquainted with them than with those of a 
thunderstorol 

the mode of discovering and proving laws of 
nature which we have now examined proceeds upon 
the following om whatever circumstance can be 
excluded without prejudice to the phenomenon or 
can be absent notwithstanding its presence is not 
connected with it in the way of causation the

one remains that one is the cause which we are in

tain among them the cause and so mutatis mutandis 
of the effect as this method proceeds by comparing 
different instances to ascertain in what they agree i 
have termed it the method of agreement and we 
may adopt as its regulating principle the following 
canon — 

first canon 

if two or more instances of the phenomenon under 
investigation have only one circumstance in common the 
circumstance in which alone all the instances agree is 
the cause cor effectj of the given phenomenon 

quitting for the present the method of agree 
ment to which we shall almost immediately return 
we proceed to a still more potent instrument of the 
investigation of nature the method of difference 

§ in the method of agreement we endeavoured 
to obtain instances which agreed in the given circum 
stance but differed in every other in the present 
method we require on the contrary two instances 
resembling one another in every other respect but 
differing in the presence or absence of the phenomenon 
we wish to study if our object be to discover the 
effects of an agent a we must procure a in some set 
of ascertained circumstances as abc and having 
noted the effects produced compare them with the 
effect of the remaining circumstances b c when a is 
absent if the effect of a b c is a ft c and the effect 
of b c c it is evident that the effect of a is a so 
again if we begin at the other end and desire to 
investigate the cause of an effect a we must select an 
instance as a c in which the effect occurs and in 
which the antecedents were abc and we must look 
out for another instance in which the remaining

circumstances he occur without a if the antece 
dents in that instance are b c we know that the 
cause of a must be a either a alone or a in conjunc 
tion with some of the other circumstances present 

it is scarcely necessary to give examples of a 
logical process to which we owe almost all the induc 
tive conclusions we draw in daily life when a man 
is shot through the heart it is by this method we 
know that it was the gunshot which killed him for 
he was in the fulness of life immediately before all 
circumstances being the same except the wound 

the axioms which are taken for granted in this 
method are evidently the following whatever ante 
cedent cannot be excluded without prbventing the 
phenomenon is the cause or a condition of that 
phenomenon whatever consequent can be excludedt 
with no other difference in the antecedents than the 
absence of a particular one is the effect of that 
one instead of comparing different instances of 
a phenomenon to discover in what they agree this 
method compares an instance of its occurrence with 
an instance of its nonoccurrence to discover in 
what they differ the canon which is the regulating 
principle of the method of difference may be expressed 
as follows — 

second canon 

if an instance in which the phenomenon under inves 
tigation occurs and an instance in which it does not 
occuty have every circumstance save one in common 
that one occurring only in the former the circumstance 
in which alone the two instances differ is the effect or 
cause or a necessary part of the caie of the pheno

§ the two methods which we have now stated 
have many features of resemblance but there are also 
many distinctions between them both are methods 
of elimination this term which is employed in the 
theory of equations to denote the process by which 
one after another of the elements of a question is 
excluded and the solution made to depend upon the 
relation between the remaining elements only is well 
suited to express the operation analogous to this 
which has been understood since the time of bacon 
to be the foundation of experimental inquiry namely 
the successive exclusion of the various circumstances 
which are foimd to accompany a phenomenon in a given 
instance in order to ascertain what are those among 
them which can be absent consistently with the exist 
ence of the phenomenon the method of agreement 
stands on the ground that whatever can be eliminated is 
 not connected with the phenomenon by any law the 
 method of difference has for its foundation that what 
ever can not be eliminated is connected with the phe 
nomenon by a law 

of these methods that of difference is more 
particularly a method of artificial experiment while 
that of agreement is more especially the resource we 
employ where experimentation is impossible a few 
reflections will prove the fact and point out the 
reason of it 

it is inherent in the peculiar character of the 
method of difference that the nature of the combi 
nations which it requires is much more strictly defined 
than in the method of agreement the two instances 
which are to be comjared with one another must be 
exactly similar in ail circumstances except the one 
which we are attempting to investigate they must be 
in the relation of a b c and b c or of a c and b c

the four experimental methods 

it is true that this similarity of circumstances needs 
not extend to such as are already known to be 
immaterial to the result and in the case of most 
phenomena we learn at once from the most ordinary 
experience that most of the coexistent phenomena of 
the universe may be either present or absent without 
affecting the given phenomenon or if present are 
present indifferently when the phenomenon does not 
happen and when it does still even limiting the 
identity which is required between the two instances 
abc and bc to such circumstances as are not 
already known to be indifferent it is very seldom that 
nature affords two instances of which we can be 
assured that they stand in this precise relation to 
one another in the spontaneous operations of 
natuie there is generally such complication and such 
obscurity they are mostly either on so overwhelm 
ingly large or on so inaccessibly minute a scale we 
are so ignorant of a great part of the £sict which 
really take place and even those of which we are not 
ignorant are so multitudinous and therefore so seldom 
exactly alike in any two cases that a spontaneous 
experiment of the kind required by the method of 
difference is commonly not to be found when on 
the contrary we obtain a phenomenon by an artificial 
experiment a pair of instances such as the method 
requires is obtained almost as a matter of course 
provided the process does not last a long time a 
certain state of surrounding circumstances existed 
before we commenced the experiment this is b c 
we then introduce a say for instance by merely 
bringing an object from another part of the room 
before there has been time for any change in the 
other elements it is in short as m comte observes 
the very nature of an experiment to introduce into the

 induction 

preexisting state of circumstances a change perfectly 
definite we choose a previous state of things with 
which we are well acquainted so that no unforeseen 
alteration in that state is likely to pass unobserved 
and into this we introduce as rapidly as possible the 
phenomenon which we wish to study so that we in 
general are entitled to feel complete assurance that 
the preexisting state and the state which we have 
produced difier in nothing except in the presence or 
absence of that phenomenon if a bird is taken from 
a cage and instantly plunged into carbonic acid gas 
the experimentalist may be fully assured at all events 
after one or two repetitions that no circumstance 
capable of causing suffocation had supervened in the 
interim except the change from immersion in the 
atmosphere to immersion in carbonic acid gas there 
is one doubt indeed which may remain in some cases 
of this description the effect may have been pro 
duced not by the change but by the means we 
employed to produce the change the possibility 
however of this last supposition generally admits of 
being conclusively tested by other experiments it 
thus appears that in the study of the various kinds of 
phenomena which we can by our voluntary agency 
modify or control we can in general satisfy the requi 
sitions of the method of difference but that by the 
spontaneous operations of nature those requisitions 
are seldom fulfilled 

the reverse of this is the case with the method 
of agreement we do not here require instances of 
so special and determinate a kind any instances 
whatever in which nature presents us witii a pheno 
menon may be examined for the purposes of this 
method and if all such instances agree in any 
thing a conclusion of considerable value is already

attained we can seldom indeed be sure that this 
one point of agreement is the only one but our igno 
rance does not as in the method of difference vitiate 
the conclusion the certainty of the result as far as 
it goes is not affected we have ascertained one 
invariable antecedent or consequent however many 
other invariable antecedents or consequents may stih 
remain unascertained if abc ade afg are 
all equally followed by a then a is an invariable con 
sequent of a jf ab c ad e af g all number a 
among their antecedents then a is connected as an 
antecedent by some invariable law with a but to 
determine whether this invariable antecedent is a 
cause or this invariable consequent an effect we must 
be able in addition to produce the one by means of 
the other or at least to obtain that which alone 
constitutes our assurance of having produced any 
thing namely an instance in which the effect cf has 
come into existence with no other change in the 
preexisting circumstances than the addition of a 
and this if we can do it is an application of the 
method of difference not of the method of agree 
ment 

it thus appears to be by the method of difference u 
alone that we can ever in the way of direct expe 
rience arrive with certainty at causes the method of 
agreement leads only to laws of phenomena as mr 
whewell calls them but which since laws of causation 
are also laws of phenomena i prefer to designate as 
uniformities in which the question of causation must for 
the present remain undecided the method of agree 
ment is chiefly to be resorted to as a means of suggest 
ing applications of the method of difference as in the 
last example the comparison of a b c a d e a f g 
suggested that a was the antecedent on which to try

the experiment whether it could produce a or as 
an inferior resource in case the method of dtflference 
is impracticable which as we before showed gene 
rally arises from the impossibility of artificially pro 
ducing the phenomena and hence it is that the 
method of agreement although applicable in principle 
to either case is more emphatically the method of 
investigation on those subjects where artificial experi 
mentation is impossible because on those it is gene 
rally our only resource of a directly inductive nature 
while in the phiomena which we can produce at 
pleasure the method of difference generally affords a 
more efficacious process which will ascertain causes as 
well as mere laws 

 our next remark shall be that there are 
many cases in which although our power of producing 
the phenomenon is complete the method of difference 
either cannot be made available at all or not without 
a previous employment of the method of agreement 
this occurs when the agency by which we can 
produce the phenomenon is not that of one single 
antecedent but a combination of antecedents which 
we have no power of separating from each other and 
exhibiting apart for instance suppose the subject 
of inquiry to be the cause of the double refraction of 
light we can produce this phenomenon at pleasure 
by employing any one of the many substances which 
are known to refract light in that peculiar manner 
but if taking one of those substances as iceland spar 
for example we wish to determine on which of the 
properties of iceland spar this remarkable pheno 
menon depends we can make no use for that pur 
pose of the method of difference for we cannot id 
another substance precisely resembling icdand spar 

digitized by vjooq ic 



ttle four experimental methods 

except in some one property the only mode there 
fore of prosecuting this mqniry is that afforded by the 
method of agreement by which in fact through a 
comparison of all the known substances which had 
the property of doubly refracting light it was ascer 
tained that they agreed in the single circumstance of 
being crystauine substances and although the con 
verse does not hold although all crystalline substances 
have not the property of double refraction it was 
concluded with reason that there is a real connection 
between these two properties that either crystauine 
structure or the cause which gives rise to that struc 
ture is one of the conditions of double refraction 

out of this employment of the method of agree 
ment arises a peculiar modification of that method 
which is sometimes of great avail in the investigation 
of nature in cases similar to the above in which it 
is not possible to obtain the precise pair of instances 
which our second canon requires — instances agreeing 
in every antecedent except a or in every consequent 
except a we may yet be able by a double employ 
ment of the method of agreement to discover in what 
the instances which contain a or a differ from those 
which do not 

if we compare various instances in which a occurs 
and find that they all have in common the circum 
stance a and as far as can be observed no other 
circumstance the method of agreement so far bears 
testimony to a connexion between a and a in order 
to convert this proof of connexion into proof of 
causation by the direct method of difference we 
ought to be able in some one of these instances as 
for example abc to leave out a and observe 
whether by doing so a is prevented now supposing 
what is often the case that we are not able to try 

digitized by vjooq ic

this decisive experiment yet provided we can by 
any means discover what would be its result if we 
vokld try it the advantage will be the same sup 
pose then that as we previously examined a variety 
of instances in which a occurred and found them to 
agree in containing a so we now observe a variety 
of instances in which a does not occur and find 
them agree in not containing a which establishes by 
the method of agreement the same connexion between 
the absence of a and the absence of a which was 
before established between their presence as then it 
had been shown that whenever a is present a is present 
so it being now shown that when a is taken away a is 
removed along with it we have by the one proposition 
a b c a fc c by the other b c c the positive and 
negative instances which the method of difference re 
quires thus if it be true that all animals which have a 
welldeveloped respiratory system and therefore aerate 
the blood perfectly agree in being warmblooded while 
those whose respiratory system is imperfect do not 
maintain a temperature much exceeding that of the 
surrounding medium we may argue from this two 
fold experience that the change which takes place 
in the blood by respiration is the cause of animal 
heat 

this method may be called the indirect method of 
difference or the joint method of agreement and 
difference and consists in a double employment of 
the method of agreement each proof being indepen 
dent of the other and corroborating it but it is not 
equivalent to a proof by the direct method of differ 
ence for the requisitions of the method of difference 
are not satisfied unless we can be quite sure either 
that the instances aflsrmative of a agree in no antece 
dent whatever but a or that the instances negative of

a agree m nothing but the negation of a now if it 
were possible which it never is to have this assurance 
we should not need the joint method for either of 
the two sets of instances separately would then be 
sufficient to prove causation this indirect method 
therefore can only be viewed as a great extension and 
improvement of the method of agreement but not as 
participating in the more cogent nature of the method 
of difference the following may be stated as its 
canon — 

third canon 

if two or more instances in which the phenomenon 
occurs have only one circumstance in common while 
two or more instances inwhich it does not occur have 
nothing in common save the absence of that circum 
stance the circumstance in which alone the two sets of 
instances differ is the effect or cause or a necessary part 
of the cause of the phenomenon 

we shall presently show that the joint method 
of agreement and difference constitutes in another 
respect not yet adverted to an improvement upon the 
common method of agreement namely in being 
unaffected by a characteristic imperfection of that 
method the nature of which still remains to be 
pointed out but as we cannot enter into this expo 
sition without introducing a new element of com 
plexity into this long and intricate discussion i shall 
postpone it to the next chapter and shall at once 
proceed to the statement of two other methods which 
will complete the enumeration of the means which 
mankind possess for exploring the laws of nature by 
specific observation and experience

§ the first of these has been aptly denominated 
the method of residues its principle is very simple 
subducting from any given phenomenon all the por 
tions which by virtue of preceding inductions can be 
assigned to known causes the remainder will be the 
effect of the antecedents which had been overlooked 
or of which the effect was as yet an unknown quantity 

suppose as before that we have the antecedents 
abc followed by the consequents ab c and that 
by previous inductions founded we will suppose 
upon the method of difference we have ascertained 
the causes of some of these effects or the effects of 
some of these causes and are by this means apprised 
that the effect of a is a and that the effect of b is b 
subtracting the sum of these effects from the total 
phenomenon there remains c which now without 
any fresh experiment we may know to be the effect 
of c this method of residues is in truth a peculiar 
modification of the method of difference if the 
instance a b c a c could have been compared with 
a single instance a b a we should have proved c 
to be the cause of c by the common process of the 
method of difference in the present case however 
instead of a single instance a b we have had to study 
separately the causes a and b and to infer from the 
effects which they produce separately what effect 
they must produce in the case abc where they act 
together of the two instances therefore which the 
method of difference requires — the one positive the 
other negative — the negative one or that in which 
the given phenomenon is absent is not the direct 
result of observation and axperimesit but has been 
arrived at by deduction as one of the forms of the 
method of difference the method of residues partakes 
of its rigorous certainty provided the previous induc

the four bxperimbntal methods 

tions those which gave the effects of a and b were 
obtained by the same infallible method and provided 
we are certain that c is the only antecedent to which 
the residual phenomenon c can be referred the only 
agent of which we had not already calculated and 
subducted the effect but as we can never be quite 
certain of this the evidence derived from the method 
of residues is not complete unless we can obtain c 
artificially and try it separately or unless its agency 
when once suggested can be accounted for and 
proved deductively from known laws 

even with these reservations the method of 
residues is one of the most important among our 
instruments of discovery of all the methods of 
investigating laws of nature this is the most fertile in 
unexpected results often informing us of sequence 
in which neither the cause nor the effect were suffi 
ciently conspicuous to attract of themselves the atten 
tion of observers the agent c may be an obscure 
circumstance not likely to have been perceived unless 
sought for nor likely to have been sought for until 
attention had been awakened by the insufficiency of 
the obvious causes to account for the whole of the 
effect and c may be so disguised by its intermixture 
with a and that it would scarcely have presented 
itself spontaneously as a subject of separate study 
of these uses of the method we shall presently cite 
some remarkable examples the canon of the 
method of residues is as follows — 

fourth canon 
subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known 
by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antece 
dents and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of 
the remmning antecedents

§ there remains a class of laws which it is 
impracticable to ascertain by any of the three methods 
which i have attempted to characterize namely 
the laws of those permanent causes or indestructible 
natural agents which it is impossible either to exclude 
or to isolate which we can neither hinder from being 
present nor contrive that they shall be present alone 
it would appear at first sight that we could by no 
means separate the effects of these agents from the 
effects of those other phenomena with which they 
cannot be prevented from coexisting in respect 
indeed to most of the permanent causes no such 
difficulty exists since though we cannot eliminate 
them as coexisting facts we can eliminate them as 
influencing agents by simply trjring our experiment 
in a local situation beyond the limits of their influ 
ence the pendulum for example has its oscillations 
disturbed by the vicinity of a mountain we remove 
the pendulum to a sufficient distance frtm the moun 
tain and the disturbance ceases from these data we 
can determine by the method of difference the 
amount of effect really due to the mountain and 
beyond a certain distance everything goes on precisely 
as it would do if the mountain exercised no influence 
whatever which accordingly we with sufficient 
reason conclude to be the fact 

the difficulty therefore in appljong the methods 
already treated of to determine the effects of per 
manent causes is confined to the cases in which it is 
impossible for us to get out of the local limits of their 
influence the pendulum can be removed from the 
influence of the mountain but it cannot be removed 
from the influence of the earth we cannot take away 
the earth from the pendulum nor the pendulum from 
the earth to ascertain whether it would continue to

vibrate if the action which the earth exerts upon it 
were withdrawn on what evidence then do we 
ascribe its vibrations to the earths influence not 
on any sanctioned by the method of diflference for 
one of the two instances the negative instance is 
wanting nor by the method of agreement for 
although all pendulums agree in this that during 
their oscillations the earth is always present why may 
we not as well ascribe the phenomenon to the sun 
which is equally a coexistent fact in all the experi 
ments it is evident that to establish even so simple 
a fact of causation as this there was required some 
method over and above those which we have yet 
examined 

as another example let us take the phenomenon 
heat independently of all hypothesis as to the real 
nature of the agency so called this fact is certain 
that we are unable to exhaust any body of the whole 
of its heat it is equally certain that no one ever 
perceived heat not emanating from a body being 
unable then to separate body and heat we cannot 
effect such a variation of circumstances as the fore 
going three methods require we cannot ascertain by 
those methods what portion of the phenomena 
exhibited by any body are due to the heat contained 
in it if we could observe a body with its heat and 
the same body entirely divested of heat the method 
of difference would show the effect due to the heat 
apart from that due to tiie body if we could observe 
beat under circumstances agreeing in nothing but heat 
and therefore not characterized also by the presence 
of a body we could ascertain the effects of heat from 
an instance of heat with a body and an instance of 
heat without a body by the method of agreement 
or if we pleased we could determine by the method 

obizi by google 



 induction 

of difference what effect was due to the body when 
the remainder which wa due to the heat would be 
given by the method of residues but we can do 
none of these things and without them the appli 
cation of any of the three methods to the solution of 
this problem would be illusory it would be idle for 
instance to attempt to ascertain the effect of heat by 
subtracting from the phenomena exhibited by a body 
all that is due to its other properties for as we have 
never been able to observe any bodies without a 
portion of heat in them the effects due to that heat 
may form a part of the very results which we affect to 
subtract in order that the effect of heat may be shown 
by the residue 

if therefore there were no other methods of 
eicperimental investigation than these three we should 
be for ever unable to determine the effects due to heat 
as a cause but we have still a resource though 
we cannot exclude an antecedent altogether we may 
be able to produce or nature may produce for us 
some modication in it by a modification is here 
meant a change in it not amounting to its total 
removal if some modification in the antecedent a 
is always followed by a change in the consequent a 
the other consequents and c remaining the same 
or mce versd if every change in a is found to have 
been preceded by some modification in a none being 
observable in any of the other antecedents we may 
safely conclude that a is wholly or in part an effect 
traceable to a or at least in some way connected with 
it through causation for example in the case of 
heat though we cannot expel it together from any 
body we can modify it in quantity we can increase 
or diminish it and doing so we find by the various 
methods of experimentation or observation already

the four experimental methods 

treated of that such increase or dimmution of heat is 
followed by expansion or contraction of the body 
in this manner we arrive at the conclusion otherwise 
unattainable by us that one of the effects of heat is 
to enlarge the dimensions of bodies or what is the 
same thing in other words to widen the distances 
between their particles 

a change in a thing not amounting to its total 
removal that is a change which leaves it still the 
same thing it was must be a change either in its 
quantity or in some of its relations to other things of 
which relations the principal is its position in space 
in the previous example the modification which was 
produced in the antecedent was an alteration in its 
quantity let us now suppose the question to be 
what influence the moon exerts on the surface of 
the earth we cannot try an experiment in the 
absence of the moon so as to observe what terrestrial 
phenomena her annihilation would put an end to 
but when we find that all the variations in the position 
of the moon are followed by corresponding variations 
in the time and place of high water the place being 
always either on the side of the earth which is 
nearest to or on that which is most remote from the 
moon we have ample evidence that the moon is 
wholly or partially the cause which determines the 
tides it very commonly happens as it does in this 
instance that the variations of an effect are corre 
spondent or analogous to those of its cause as the 
moon moves further towards the east tiie high 
water point does the same but this is not an indis 
pensable condition as may be seen in the same 
example for along with that high water point there 
is at the same instant another high water point 
diametrically opposite to it and which therefore

 induction 

of necessity moves towards the west as the moon 
followed by the nearer of the tide waves advances 
towards the east and yet both these motions are 
equally effects of the moons motion 

that the oscillations of the pendulum are caused 
by the earth is proved by similar evidence those 
oscillations take place between equidistant points on 
the two sides of a line which being perpendicular to 
the earth varies with every variation in the earths 
position either in space or relatively to the object 
speaking accurately we only know by the method 
now characterized that all terrestrial bodies tend to 
the earth and not to some unknown fixed point lying 
in the same direction in every twentyfour hours 
by the earths rotation the line drawn from the body 
at right angles to the earth coincides successively 
with all the radii of a circle and in the course of six 
months the place of that circle varies by nearly two 
hundred millions of miles yet in all these changes of 
the earths position the line in which bodies tend to 
fall continues to be directed towards it which proves 
that terrestrial gravity is directed to the earth and 
not as was once fancied by some to a fixed point of 
space 

the method by which these results were obtained 
may be termed the method of concomitant variations 
it is regulated by the following canon — 

fifth canon 

whatever phenomenon varies in any manner when 
ever another phenomenon varies in some particular 
manner y is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon 
or is connected with it through some fact of causation 

the last clause is subjoined because it by no 
means follows when two phenomena accompany each

other in their variations that the one is cause and the 
other effect the same thing may and indeed must 
happen supposing them to be two different effects of 
a common cause and by this method alone it would 
never be possible to ascertain which of the two sup 
positions is the true one the only way to solve the 
doubt would be that which we have so often adverted 
to viz by endeavouring to ascertain whether we can 
produce the one set of variations by means of the 
other in the case of heat for example by increasing 
the temperature of a body we increase its bulk but 
by increasing its bulk we do not increase its tem 
perature on the contrary as in the rarefaction of air 
under the receiver of an airpump we generally 
diminish it therefore heat is not an effect but a 
cause of increase of bulk if we cannot ourselves 
produce the variations we must endeavour though 
it is an attempt which is seldom successful to find 
them produced by nature in some case in which 
the preexisting circumstances are perfectly known 
to us 

it is scarcely necessary to say that in order to 
ascertain the uniform concomitance of variations in 
the effect with variations in the cause the same 
precautions must be used as in any other case of the 
determination of an invariable sequence we must 
endeavovu to retain all the other antecedents un 
changed while that particular one is subjected to the 
requisite series of variations or in other words that 
we may be warranted in inferring causation from 
concomitance of variations the concomitance itself 
must be proved by the method of difference 

it might at first appear that the method of con 
comitant variations assumes a new axiom or law of 
causation in general namely that every modification

of the cause is followed by a change in the effect and 
it does usually happen that when a phenomenon a 
causes a phenomenon a any variation in the quantity 
or in the various relations of a is uniformly followed 
by a variation in the quantity or relations of a to 
take a familiar instance that of gravitation the 
sun causes a certain tendency to motion in the earth 
here we have cause and effect but that tendency is 
towards the sun and therefore varies in direction as 
the sun varies in the relation of position and more 
over the tendency varies in intensity in a certain 
numerical ratio to the suns distance from the earth 
that is according to another relation of the sun 
thus we see that there is not only an invariable con 
nexion between the sun and the earths gravitation 
but that two of the relations of the sun its position 
with respect to the earth and its distance from the 
earth are invariably connected as antecedents with 
the quantity and direction of the earths gravitation 
the cause of the earths gravitating at all is simply 
the sun but the cause of her gravitating with a given 
intensity and in a given direction is the existence of 
the sun in a given direction and at a given distance 
it is not strange that a modified cause which is in 
truth a different cause should produce a different 
effect but as the cause is only different in its quan 
tity or in some of its relations it usually happens 
that the effect also is only changed in its quantity or 
its relations 

although it is for the most part true that a modi 
fication of the cause is followed by a modification of 
the effect the method of concomitant variations does 
not however presuppose this as an axiom it only 
requires the converse proposition that anything upon 
whose modifications modifications of an effect are

invariably consequent must be the cause or con 
nected with the cause of that effect a proposition 
the truth of which is evident for if the thing itself 
had no influence on the effect neither could the modi 
cations of the thing have any influence if the stars 
have no power over the fortunes of men it is implied 
in the very terms that the conjunctions or oppositions 
of different stars can have no such power 

although the most striking applications of the 
method of concomitant variations take place in the 
cases in which the method of difference strictly so 
called is impossible its use is not confined to those 
cases it may often usefully follow after the method 
of difference to give additional precision to a solution 
which that has found when by the method of differ 
ence it has first been ascertained that a certain object 
produces a certain effect the method of concomitant 
variations may be usefully called in to determine 
according to what law the quantity or the different 
relations of the effect follow those of the cause 

 the case in which this method admits of the 
most extensive employment is that in which the 
variations of the cause are variations of quantity of 
such variations we may in general aflirm with safety 
that they will be attended not only with variations 
but with similar variations of the effect the proposi 
tion that more of the cause is followed by more of 
the effect being a corollary from the principle of the 
composition of causes which as we have seen is the 
general rule of causation cases of the opposite 
description in which causes change their properties 
on being conjoined with one another being on the 
contrary special and exceptional suppose then 
that when a changes in quantity a also changes in

 induction 

quantity and in such a manner that we can trace the 
numerical relation which the changes of the one bear 
to such changes of the other as take place within our 
limits of observation we may then with certain 
precautions safely conclude that the same numerical 
relation will hold beyond those limits if for instance 
we find that when a is double a is double that when 
a is treble or quadruple a is treble or quadruple we 
may conclude that if a were a half or a third a would 
be a half or a third and finally that if a were anni 
hilated a would be annihilated and that a is wholly 
the effect of a or whouy the effect of the same cause 
with a and so with any other numerical relation 
according to which a and a would vanish simulta 
neously as for instance if a were proportional to the 
square of a if on the other hand a is not wholly 
the effect of a but yet varies when a varies it is 
probably to use a mathematical phrase a function 
not of a alone but of a and something else its 
changes will be such as would occur if part of it 
remained constant or varied on some other principle 
and the remainder varied in some numerical relation 
to the variations of a in that case when a dimi 
nishes a will seem to approach not towards zero but 
towards some other limit and when the series of 
variations is such as to indicate what that limit is if 
constant or the law of its variation if variable the 
limit will exactly measure how much of a is the effect 
of some other and independent cause and the re 
mainder will be the effect of a or of the cause of a 

these conclusions however must not be drawn 
without certain precautions in the first place the 
possibility of drawing them at all manifestly supposes 
that we are acquainted not only with the variations 
but with the absolute quantities both of a and a if

the four experimental methods 

we do not know the total quantities we cannot of 
course determine the real numerical relation according 
to which those quantities vary it is therefore an 
error to conclude as some have concluded that be 
cause increase of heat expands bodies that is increases 
the distance between their particles therefore that 
distance is wholly the eflfect of heat and that if we 
could entirely exhaust the body of its heat the par 
ticles would be in complete contact this can never 
be more than a guess and of the most hazardous sort 
not a legitimate induction for since we neither know 
how much heat there is in any body nor what is the 
real distance between any two of its particles we 
cannot judge whether the contraction of the distance 
does or does not follow the diminution of the quantity 
of heat according to such a numerical relation that 
the two quantities would vanish simultaneously 

in contrast with this let us consider a case in 
which the absolute quantities are known the case 
contemplated in the first law of motion viz that all 
bodies in motion continue to move in a straight line 
with uniform velocity until acted upon by some new 
force this assertion is in open opposition to first 
appearances all terrestrial objects when in motion 
gradually abate their velocity and at last stop which 
accordingly the ancients with their inductio per enu 
merationem simplicem imagined to be the law every 
moving body however encounters various obstacles 
as friction the resistance of the atmosphere c 
which we know by daily experience to be causes 
capable of destroying motion it was suggested that 
the whole of the retardation might be owing to these 
causes how was this inquired into if the obstacles 
could have been entirely removed the case would 
have been amenable to the method of difference they 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

could not be removed they could only be diminished 
and the case therefore admitted only of the method 
of concomitant variations this accordingly being 
employed it was found that every diminution of the 
obstacles diminished the retardation of the motion 
and inasmuch as in this case unlike the case of heat 
the total quantities both of the antecedent and of the 
consequent were known it was practicable to esti 
mate with an approach to accuracy bpth the amount 
of the retardation and the amount o the retarding 
causes or resistances and to judge how near they 
both were to being exhausted and it appeared that 
the effect dwindled as rapidly and at each step was 
as far on the road towards annihilation as the cause 
was the simple oscillation of a weight suspended 
from a fixed point and moved a little out of the 
perpendicular which in ordinary circumstances lasts 
but a few minutes was prolonged in bordas experi 
ments to more than thirty hours by diminishing as 
much as possible the friction at the point of suspen 
sion and by making the body oscillate in a space 
exhausted as nearly as possible of its air there 
could therefore be no hesitation in assigning the whole 
of the retardation of motion to the influence of the 
obstacles and since after subducting this retardation 
from the total phenomenon the remainder was an 
uniform velocity the result was the proposition 
known as the first law of motion 

there is also another characteristic uncertainty 
affecting the inference that the law of variation 
which the quantities observe within our umits of 
observation will hold beyond those limits there is 
of course in the first instance the possibility that 
beyond the limits and in circumstances therefore of 
which we have no direct experience some counter

the four experimental methods 

acting cause might develop itself either a new agent 
or a new property of the agents concerned which lies 
dormant in the circumstances we are able to observe 
this is an element of uncertainty which enters largely 
into all our predictions of effects but it is not pecu 
liarly applicable to the method of concomitant varia 
tions the uncertainty however of which i am 
about to speak is characteristic of that method 
especially m the cases in which the extreme limits of 
our observation are very narrow in comparison with 
the possible variations in the quantities of the pheno 
mena any one who has the slightest acquaintance 
with mathematics is aware that very different laws of 
variation may produce numerical results which differ 
but slightly from one another within narrow limits 
and it is often only when the absolute amounts of 
variation are considerable that the difference between 
the results given by one law and by another becomes 
appreciable when therefore such variations in the 
quantity of the antecedents as we have the means of 
observing are but small in comparison with the total 
quantities there is much danger lest we should mis 
take the numerical law and be led quite to miscal 
culate the variations which would take place beyond 
the limits a miscalculation which would vitiate any 
conclusion respecting the dependence of the effect 
upon the cause which could be foimded upon those 
variations examples are not wanting of such mis 
takes the formulae says sir john herschel 
 which have been empirically deduced for the elasti 
city of steam tol very recently and those for the 
resistance of fluids and other similar subjects when 
relied on beyond the limits of the observations from 



 ditcourse en the study of natural phxumphyy p

 induction 

which they were deduced have almost invariably 
failed to support the theoretical structures which have 
been erected on them 

under this uncertainty the conclusion we may 
draw from the concomitant variations of a and a to 
the existence of an invariable and exclusive connexion 
between them or to the permanency of the same 
numerical relation between their variations when the 
quantities are much greater or smaller than those 
which we have had the means of observing cannot 
be considered to rest upon a complete induction all 
that in such a case can be regarded as proved on the 
subject of causation is that there is some connexion 
between the two phenomena that a or something 
which can influence a must be one of the causes 
which collectively determine a we may however 
feel assured that the relation which we have observed 
to exist between the variations of a and a will hold 
true in all cases which fall between the same extreme 
limits that is wherever the utmost increase or 
diminution in which the result has been found by 
observation to coincide with the law is not exceeded 

the four methods which it has now been attempted 
to describe are the only possible modes of experimen 
tal inquiry of direct induction a posteriori as distin 
guished from deduction at least i know not nor am 
able to conceive any others and even of these the 
method of residues as we have seen is not indepen 
dent of deduction though as it requires specific 
experience in addition it may without impropriety 
be included among methods of direct observation and 
experiment 

these then with such assistance as can be 
obtained from deduction compose the available 
resources of the human mind for ascertaining the

miscellaneous examples of the four 
methods 

§ i shall select as my first example an 
interesting speculation of one of the most eminent 
theoretical chemists of the present or any age dr 
liebig the object in view is to ascertain the imme 
diate cause of the death produced by metallic poisons 

arsenious acid and the salts of lead bismuth 
copper and mercury if introduced into the animal 
organism except in the smallest doses destroy life 
these facts have long been known as insulated 
truths of the lowest order of generalization but it 
was reserved for ldebig by an apt employment of the 
first two of our methods of experimental inquiry to 
connect these truths together by a higher induction 
pointing out what property common to all these 
deleterious substances is the really operating cause of 
their fatal effect 

when solutions of these substances are placed in 
sufficiently close contact with many animal products 
albumen milk muscular fibre and animal mem 
branes the acid or salt leaves the water in which it 
was dissolved and enters into combination with the 
animal substance which substance after being thus 
acted upon is found to have lost its tendency to spon 
taneous decomposition or putrefaction 

observation also shows in cases where death has 
been produced by these poisons that the parts of the 
body with which the poisonous substances have been 
brought into contact do not afterwards putrefy 



digitized

examples of the four methods 

and finally when the poison has been supplied 
in too small a quantity to destroy life eschars are 
produced that is certain superficial portions of the 
tissues are destroyed which are afterwards thrown oflt 
by the reparative process taking place in the healthy 
parts 

ihese three sets of instances admit of being 
treated according to the method of agreement in 
all of them the metallic compounds are brought into 
contact with the substances which compose the 
human or animal body and the instances do not 
seem to agree in any other circumstance the 
remaining antecedents are as different and eveq 
opposite as they could possibly be made for in some 
the animal substances exposed to the action of the 
poisons are in a state of life in others only in a state 
of organization in others not even in that and 
what is the result which follows in all the cases 
the conversion of the animal substance by combi 
nation with the poison into a chemical compound 
held together by so powerful a force as to resist the 
subsequent action of the ordinary causes of decompo 
sition now organic life the necessary condition of 
sensitive life consisting in a continual state of decom 
position and recomposition of the different organs and 
tissues whatever incapacitates them for this decom 
position destroys life and thus the proximate cause 
of the death produced by this description of poisons 
is ascertained as far as the method of agreement can 
ascertain it 

let us now bring our conclusion to the test of the me 
thod of difference setting out from the cases already 
mentioned in which the antecedent is the presence of 
substances forming with the tissues a compound in 
capable of putrefaction and a fortiori incapable of the 

vol i bitiid by google 



 induction 

chemical actions wbich constitute life and the con 
sequent is death either of the whole organism or of 
some portion of it let us compare with these cases 
other cases as much resembling them as possible but 
in which that effect is not produced and first of 
all many insoluble basic salts of arsenious acid are 
known not to bq poisonous the substance called 
alkargen discovered by bunsen which contains a 
very large quantity of arsenic and approaches very 
closely in composition to the organic arsenious com 
pounds found in the body has not the slightest 
injurious action upon the organism now when 
these substances are brought into contact with the 
tissues in any way thej do not combine with them 
they do not arrest their progress to decomposition 
as far therefore as these instances go it appears 
that when the efiect is absent it is by reason of the 
absence of that antecedent which we had aheady good 
ground for considering as the proximate cause 

but the rigorous conditions of the method of 
difference are not yet satisfied for we cannot be 
sure that these unpoisonous bodies agree with the 
poisonous substances in every property except the 
particular one of entering into a difficultly decom 
posable compound with the animal tissues to renda 
the method strictly applicable we need an instance 
not of a different substance but of one of the very 
same substances under circumstances which would 
prevent it from forming with the tissues the sort of 
compound in question and then if death does not 
follow our case is made out now such instances 
are afforded by the antidotes to these poisons for 
example in case of poisoning by arsenious acid if 
hydrated peroxide of iron is administered the destruc 
tive agency is instantly checked now this peroxide

is known to combine with the acid and form a com 
pound which being insoluble cannot act at all on 
animal tissues so again sugar is a wellknown 
antidote to poisoning by salts of copper and sugar 
reduces those salts either into metallic copper or into 
the red suboxide neither of which enters into com 
bination with animal matter the disease called 
painters colic so common in manufactories of white 
lead is unknown where the workmen are accustomed 
to take as a preservative sulphuricacidlemonade a 
solution of sugar rendered acid by sulphuric add 
now diluted sulphuric acid has the property of decom 
posing all compounds of lead with organic matter and 
of course of preventing them from being formed 

there is another class of instances of the nature 
required by the method of diflference which seem at 
first sight to conflict with the theory soluble salts 
of silver such for instance as the nitrate have the 
same stifiening antiseptic eflfect on decomposing 
animal substances as corrosive sublimate and the 
most deadly metallic poisons and when applied to 
the external parts of the body the nitrate is a power 
ful caustic depriving those parts of all active vitauty 
and causing them to be thrown off by the neighbour 
ing living structures in the form of an eschar the 
nitrate and the other salts of silver ought then it 
would seem if the theory be correct to be poisonous 
yet they may be administered internally with perfect 
impunity from this apparent exception arises the 
strongest confirmation which this theory of liebig 
has yet received nitrate of silver in spite of its 
chemical properties does not poison when introduced 
into the stomach but in the stomach as in all 
animal liquids there is common salt and in the 
stomach there is also free muriatic add these sub

stances operate as natural antidotes combining with 
the nitrate and if its quantity is not too great 
immediately converting it into chloride of silver a 
substance very slightly soluble and therefore in 
capable of combining with the tissues although to the 
extent of its solubility it has a medicinal influence 
through an entirely different class of organic actions 

 the preceding instances have afforded an 
induction of a high order of conclusiveness illustrative 
of the two simplest of our four methods although not 
rising to the maximum of certainty which the method 
of difference in its most perfect exemplification is 
capable of affording for let us not forget the 
positive instance and the negative one which the 
rigour of that method requires ought to differ only in 
the presence or absence of one single circumstance 
now in the preceding argument they differ in the 
presence or absence not of a single circumstance but 
of a single substances and as every substance has 
innumerable properties there is no knowing what 
number of real differences are involved in what is 
nominally and apparently only one difference it is 
conceivable that the antidote the peroxide of iron for 
example may counteract the poison through some 
other of its properties than that of forming an insoluble 
compound with it and if so the theory would fall 
to the ground so far as it is supported by that 
instance this source of uncertainty which is a 
serious hindrance to all extensive generalizations in 
chemistry is however reduced in the present case to 
almost the lowest degree possible when we find that 
not only one substance but many substances possess 
the capacity of acting as antidotes to metallic poisons 
and that all these agree in the property of forming

examples of the four methods 

insoluble compounds with the poisons while they 
cannot be ascertained to agree in any other property 
whatsoever we have thus in favour of the theory 
all the evidence which can be obtained by what we 
termed the indirect method of difference or the joint 
method of agreement and difference the evidence of 
which though it never can amount to that of the 
method of difference properly so called may approach 
indefinitely near to it 

no similar defect of completeness in proof will 
be found in the following original investigation for 
which i am indebted to mr alexander bain at present 
lecturer on moral philosophy in marischal college 
aberdeen one of the men from whom science and 
philosophy have most to hope and who has permitted 
me to lay his extensive knowledge of every depart 
ment of physical inquiry freely under contribution 
for the purpose of exemplifying and illustrating the 
doctrines of this work 

 let the object be to ascertain the law of what 
is termed induced electricity to find under what 
conditions any electrified body whether positively or 
negatively electrified gives rise to a contrary electric 
state in some other body adjacent to it 

the most familiar exemplification of the pheno 
menon to be investigated is the following around 
the prime conductors of an electrical machine the 
atmosphere to some distance or any conducting 
surface suspended in that atmosphere is found to be 
in an electric condition opposite to that of the prime 
conductor itself near and around the positive prime 
conductor there is negative electricity and near and 
around the negative prime conductor there is positive 
electricity when pith balls are brought near to

 induction 

either of the conductors they become electiified with 
the opposite electricity to it either receiving a share 
from the aheady electrified atmosphere by conduction 
or acted upon by the direct inductive influence of the 
conductor itself they are then attracted by the con 
ductor to which they are in opposition or if with 
drawn in their electrified state they will be attracted 
by any other oppositely charged body in like 
manner the hand if brought near enough to the 
conductor receives or gives an electric discharge 
now we have no evidence thnt a charged conductor 
can be suddenly discharged unless by the approach of 
a body oppositely electrified in the case therefore 
of the electrical machine it appears that the accu 
mulation of electricity in an insulated conductor is 
always accompanied by the excitement of the contrary 
electricity in the surroundimg atmosphere and in 
every conductor placed near the fonner conductor 
it does not seem possible in this case to produce one 
electricity by itself 

let us now examine all the other instances which 
we can obtain resembling this instance in the given 
consequent namely the evolution of an opposite 
electricity in the neighbourhood of an electrified body 
as one remarkable instance we have the leyden jar 
and after the splendid experiments of faraday in 
conjiplete and final establishment of the substantial 
identity of magnetism and electricity we may cite 
the magnet both the natural and the electromagnet 
in neither of which is it possible to produce one kind 
of electricity by itself or to charge one pole without 
charging an opposite pole with the contrary electricity 
at the same time we cannot have a magnet with 
one pole if we break a natural loadstone into a 
thousand pieces each piece will have its two oppo

examples of the four methods 

sitely electrified poles complete within itself in the 
voltaic circuit again we cannot have one current 
without its opposite in the ordinary electric machine 
the glass cylinder or plate and the rubber acquire 
opposite electricities 

from all these instances treated by the method 
of agreement a general law appears to result the 
instances embrace all the known modes in which a 
body can become charged with electricity and in all 
of them there is found as a concomitant or conr 
sequent the excitement of the opposite electric state 
in some other body or bodies it seems to follow 
that the two facts are invariably connected and that 
the excitement of electricity in any body has for one 
of its necessary conditions the possibility of a simuu 
taneous excitement of the opposite electricity in some 
neighbouring body 

as the two contrary electricities can only be pro 
duced together so they can only cease together 
this may be shown by an application of the method 
of difference to the example of the leyden jar it 
needs scarcely be here remarked that in the leyden 
jar electricity can be accumulated and retained in con 
siderable quantity by the contrivance of having two 
conducting surfaces of equal extent and parallel to each 
other through the whole of that extent with a noncon 
ducting substance such as glass between them when 
one side of the jar is charged positively the other is 
charged negatively and it was by virtue of this fact 
that the leyden jar served just now as an instance in 
our employment of the method of agreement now 
it is impossible to discharge one of the coatings unless 
the other can be discharged at the same time a 
conductor held to the positive side cannot convey

 induction 

away any electricity unless an equal quantity be 
allowed to pass from the negative side if one coating 
be perfectly insulated the charge is safe the dissi 
pation of one must proceed pari passu with the other 

the law thus strongly indicated admits of cor 
roboration by the method of concomitant varia 
tions the leyden jar is capable of receiving a 
much higher charge than can ordinarily be given to 
the conductor of an electrical machine now in the 
case of the leyden jar the metallic surface which 
receives the induced electricity is a conductor exactly 
similar to that which receives the primary charge and 
is therefore as susceptible of receiving and retaining 
the one electricity as the opposite surface of receiving 
and retaining the other but in the machine the 
neighbouring body which is to be oppositely electrified 
is the surrounding atmosphere or any body casually 
brought near to the conductor and as these are 
generally much inferior in their capacity of becoming 
electrified to the conductor itself their limited power 
imposes a corresponding umit to the capacity of the 
conductor for being charged as the capacitr of tbe 
neighbouring body for supporting the opposition 
increases a higher charge becomes possible and to 
this appears to be owing the great superiority of the 
leyden jar 

a further and most decisive confirmation by the 
method of difierence is to be found in one of fara 
days experiments in the course of his researches on 
the subject of induced electricity 

since common or machine electricity and voltaic 
electricity may be considered for the present purpose 
to be identical faraday wished to know whether as 
the prime conductor developes opposite electricity

examples of the four methods 

upon a conductor in its vicinity so a voltaic current 
running along a wire would induce an opposite current 
upon another wire laid parallel to it at a short dis 
tance now this case is similar to the cases previously 
examined in every circumstance except the one to 
which we have ascribed the effect we found in the 
former instances that whenever electricity of one kind 
was excited in one body electricity of the opposite 
kind must be excited in a neighbouring body and 
the interpretation of this in the language of cause 
and effect is that all causes which can excite the one 
kind of electricity have the property of simultaneously 
exciting an equal amount of the other but in fara 
days experiment this indispensable opposition exists 
within the wire itself from the nature of a voltaic 
charge the two opposite currents necessary to the 
existence of each other are both accommodated in one 
wire and there is no need of another wire placed 
beside it to contain one of them in the same way as 
the leyden jar must have a positive and a negative 
surface the exciting cause can and does produce all 
the effect which its laws require independently of any 
electric excitement of a neighbouring body now 
the result of faradays experiment with the second 
wire was that no opposite current was produced 
there was an instantaneous effect at the closing and 
breaking of the voltaic circuit electric inductions 
appeared when the two wires were moved to and from 
one another but these are phenomena of a different 
class there was no induced electricity in the sense in 
which this is predicated of the leyden jar there was 
no sustained current running up the one wire while 
an opposite current ran down the neighbouring wire 
and this alone would have been a true parallel case to 
the other

it thus appears by the combined evidence of the me 
thod of agreement the method of concomitant vari 
ations and the most rigorous form of the method of 
difference that neither of the two kinds of electricity 
can be excited without an equal excitement of the 
other and opposite kind that both are effects of the 
same cause that the possibility of the one is a con 
dition of the possibility of the other and the quan 
tity of the one an impassable limit to the quantity 
of the other a scientific result of considerable 
interest in itself and illustrating those three me 
thods in a manner both characteristic and easily 
intelligible 

 our third example shall be extracted from 
sir john herschels discourse on the study of natural 
philosophy a work replete with admirablyselected 
exempufications of inductive processes from almost 
every department of physical science and in which 
alone of all books which i have met with the four 
methods of induction are recognised although not 
characterised and defined nor their correlation shown 
so distinctly as has appeared to me desirable the 
present example is justly described by sir john 
herschel as one of the most beautiful specimens 
which can be cited of inductive experimental inquiry 
lying within a moderate compass the theory of dew 
first promulgated by the late dr wells and now 
universally adopted by scientific men

thenlselves of the purport of the speculation as a 
whole before applying themselves with me to the 
logical analysis of the different steps of the argu 
ment 

 suppose dew were the phenomenon proposed 
whose cause we would know in the first jdace we 
must determine precisely what we mean by dew 
what the fact really is whose cause we desire to 
investigate we must separate dew from rain and 
the moisture of fogs and limit the application of the 
term to what is really meant which is the sponta 
neous appearance of moisture on substances exposed 
in the open air when no rain or visible wet is 
falling this answers to a preuminary operation 
which will be characterised in the ensuing book 
treating of operations subsidiary to induction the 
state of the question being fixed we come to the 
solution 

 now here we have analogous phenomena in the 
moisture which bedews a cold metal or stone when we 
breathe upon it that which appears on a glass of 
water fresh from the well in hot weather that which 
appears on the inside of windows when sudden rain or 
hail chills the external air that which runs down our 
walls when after a long frost a warm moist thaw 
comes on comparing these cases we find that they 
all contain the phenomenon which was proposed as 
the subject of investigation now all these instances 
agree in one point the coldness of the object dewed 
in comparison with the air in contact with it but 
there still remains the most important case of all 
that of nocturnal dew does the same circumstance

 induction 

exist in this case is it a fact that the object 
dewed is colder than the air certainly not one 
would at first be inclined to say for what is to make 
it so but the experiment is easy we have only 
to lay a thermometer in contact with the dewed sub 
stance and hang one at a uttle distance above it out 
of reach of its influence the experiment has been 
therefore made the question has been asked and 
the answer has been invariably in the affirmative 
whenever an object contracts dew it is colder than 
the air 

here then is a complete application of the 
method of agreement establishing the fact of an inva 
riable connexion between the deposition of dew on a 
surface and the coldness of that surface compared 
with the external air but which of these is cause 
and which effect or are they both effects of some 
thing else on this subject the method of agreement 
can afford us no ught we must call in a more potent 
method 

that dews are accompanied with a chill is a 
common remark but vulgar prejudice would make 
the cold the effect rather than the cause we must 
therefore collect more facts or which comes to the 
same thing vary the circumstances since every 
instance in which the circumstances differ is a fresh 
fact and especially we must note the contrary or 
negative cases i e where no dew is produced for 
we are aware that a comparison between instances of 
dew and instances of no dew is the condition neces 
sary to bring the method of difference into play 

 now first no dew is produced on the surface of 
polished metals but it is very copiously on glass both 
exposed with their faces upwards and in some cases

the under side of a horizontal plate of glass is also 
dewed here is an instance in which the eflfect is 
produced and another instance in which it is not 
produced but we cannot yet pronounce as the canon 
of the method of diflperence requires that the latter 
instance agrees with the former in all its circum 
stances except one for the differences between glass 
and polished metals are manifold and the only thing 
we can as yet be sure of is that the cause of dew will 
be found among the circumstances by which the 
former substance is distinguished from the latter 
but if we could be sure that glass and the various 
other substances on which dew is deposited have only 
one quality in common and that polished metals and 
the other substances on which dew is not deposited 
have also nothing in common but the one circum 
stance of not having the one quality which the others 
have the requisitions of the method of difference 
would be completely satisfied and we should recog 
nise in that quality of the substances the cause of 
dew this accordingly is the path of inquiry which 
is next to be pursued 

 in the cases of polished metal and polished glass 
the contrast shows evidently that the substance has 
much to do with the phenomenon therefore let the 
substance alone be diversified as much as possible by 
exposing polished surfaces of various kinds this 



 this last circumstance adds sir john herschel excludes 
the fall of moisture from the sky in an invisible form which would 
naturally suggest itself as a cause i have omitted this passage in 
the text as not pertinent to the purpose in hand the argument 
which it contains being deductive and d priori the fall of 
moisture is rejected as a cause because from its laws previously 
known we infer that it could not have produced the particular 
phenomenon last mentioned

done a scale of intensity becomes obvious those 
polished substances are found to be most strongly 
dewed which conduct heat worst while those which 
conduct well resist dew most eflfectually the 
complication increases here is the method of conco 
mitant variations called to our assistance and no 
other method was practicable upon this occasion for 
the quality of conducting heat could not be excladedu 
since all substances conduct heat in some tegree 
the conclusion obtained is that cmteris paribus the 
deposition of dew is in some proportion to the power 
which the body possesses of resisting the passage of 
heat and that this therefore or something con 
nected with this must be at least one of the causes 
which assist in producing the deposition of dew upcm 
the surface 

but if we expose rough surfaces instead of 
polished we sometimes find this law interfered with 
thus roughened iron especially if painted over or 
blackened becomes dewed sooner than varnished 
paper the kind of surface therefore has a great 
influence expose then the same material in very 
diversified states as to surface that is employ the 
method of difference to ascertain concomitance of 
variations and another scale of intensity becomes 
at once apparent those surfojces which part tvith their 
heat most readily by radiation are found to contract 
dew most copiously here therefore are the requi 
sites for a second employment of the method of con 
comitant variations which in this case also is the 
only method available since all substances radiate 
heat in some degree or othfer the conclusion 
obtained by this new application of the method is 
that c€bteris paribus the deposition of dew is also in 
some proportion to the power of radiating heat and

that the quality of doing this abundantly or some 
cause on which that quality depends is another of 
the causes which promote the deposition of dew upon 
the substance 

 again the influence ascertained to exist of sub 
stance and surface leads us to consider that of texture 
and here again we are presited on trial with 
remarkable difierences and with a third scale of 
intensity pointing out substances of a close firm 
texture such as stones metals c as unfavourable 
but those of a loose one as cloth wool velvet eider 
down cotton c as eminently favourable to the 
contraction of dew the method of concomitant 
variations is here for the third time had recourse to 
and as before from necessity since the texture of no 
substance is absolutely firm or absolutely loose 
looseness of texture therefore or something which 
is the cause of that quality is another circumstance 
which promotes the deposition of dew but this third 
cause resolves itself into the first viz the quality of 
resisting the passage of heat for substances of loose 
texture are precisely those which are best adapted for 
clothing or for impeding the free passage of heat from 
the skin into the air so as to allow their outer sur 
faces to be very cold while they remain warm within 
and this last is therefore an induction from fresh 
instances simply corroborative of a former induction 

it thus appears that the instances in which much 
dew is deposited which are very various agree in 
this and so far as we are able to observe in this only 
that they either radiate heat rapidly or conduct it 
slowly qualities between which there is no other cir 
cumstance of agreement than that by virtue of either 
the body tends to lose heat from the surface more 
rapidly than it can be restored from within the

 induction 

instances on the contrary in which no dew or but a 
small quantity of it is formed and which are also 
extremely various agree so far as we can observe in 
nothing except in not having this same property we 
seem therefore to have detected the sole difference 
between the substances on which dew is produced 
and those on which it is not produced and thus 
have been realized the requisitions of what we have 
termed the indirect method of difference or the joint 
method of agreement and difference the example 
afforded of this indirect method and of the manner in 
which the data are prepared for it by the methods of 
agreement and of concomitant variations is the most 
important of all the illustrations of induction afforded 
by this most interesting speculation 

we might now consider the question upon what 
the deposition of dew depends to be completely 
solved if we could be quite sure that the substances 
on which dew is produced differ from those on which 
it is not in nothing but in the property of losing heat 
from the surface faster than the loss can be repaired 
from within and although we never can have that 
complete certainty this is not of so much importance 
as might at first be supposed for we have at all 
events ascertained that even if there be any other 
quauty hitherto unobserved which is present in all 
the substances which contract dew and absent in 
those which do not this other property must be one 
which in all that great number of substances is 
present or absent exactly where the property of being 
a better radiator than conductor is present or absent 
an extent of coincidence which affords the strongest 
presumption of a community of cause and a conse 
quent invariable coexistence between the two proper 
ties so that the property of being a better radiator

than conductor if not itself the cause almost certainly 
always accompanies the cause and for purposes of 
prediction no error will be committed by treating it 
as if it were really such 

reverting now to an earlier stage of the inquiry 
let us remember that we had ascertained that in every 
instance where dew is formed there is actual coldness 
of the surface below the temperature of the surrounding 
air but we were not sure whether this coldness was 
the cause of dew or its effect this doubt we are now 
able to resolve we have found that in every such 
instance the substance must be one which by its own 
properties or laws would if exposed in the night 
become colder than the surrounding air but if the 
dew were the cawe of the coldness that effect would 
be produced in other substances and not solely in 
those whose own laws suffice to produce it whether 
there were dew or no that supposition therefore 
is repelled but there were only three suppositions 
possible the dew is the cause of the coldness both 
are caused by some third circumstance or the cold 
ness is the cause of the dew the first is refuted the 
second is inapplicable the cause of the coldness is a 
known cause a radiation from the surface greater 
than can be supplied by conduction now this by its 
known laws can produce no direct effect except cold 
ness there remains only the third supposition that 
the coldness is the cause of the dew which therefore 
may be considered as completely made out 

this law of causation already so amply established 
admits however of most efficient additional corrobo 
ration in no less than three ways first by deduc 
tion from the known laws of aqueous vapour when 
diffused through air or any other gas and although 
we have not yet come to the deductive method we 

vol i k t

will not omit what is necessary to render this specula 
tion complete it is known by direct experiment that 
only a limited quantity of water can remain suspended in 
the state of vapour at each degree of temperature and 
that this maximum grows less and less as the tempe 
rature diminishes from this it follows deductively 
that if there is already as much vapour suspended as 
the air will contain at its existing temperature any 
lowering of that temperature will cause a portion of 
the vapour to be condensed and become water but 
again we know deductively from the laws of heat 
that the contact of the air with a body colder than 
itself will necessarily lower the temperature of the 
stratum of air immediately applied to its surface and 
will therefore cause it to part with a portion of its water 
which accordingly will by the ordinary laws of gravita 
tion or cohesion attach itself to the surftk of the body 
thereby constituting dew this deductive proof it 
will have been seen has the advantage of proving at 
once causation as well as coexistence and it has the 
additional advantage that it also accounts for the 
exceptions to the occurrence of the phenomenon the 
cases in which although the body is colder than the 
air yet no dew is deposited by showing that this 
will necessarily be the case when the air is so under 
supplied with aqueous vapour comparatively to its 
temperature that even when somewhat cooled by the 
contact of the colder body it can still continue to 
hold in suspension all the vapour which was pre 
viously suspended in it thus in a very dry summer 
there are no dews in a very dry winter no hoar fixjst 
here therefore is an additional condition of the pro 
duction of dew which the methods we previously 
made use of failed to detect and which might have 
remained still undetected if recourse had not been

had to the plan of deducing the effect from the ascer 
tained properties of the agents known to be present 

the second corroboration of the theory is by direct 
experiment according to the canon of the method of 
difference we can by cooling the surface of any 
body find in all cases some temperature more or less 
inferior to that of the surrounding air according to 
its hygrometric condition at which dew will begin 
to be deposited here too therefore the causation 
is directly proved we can it is true accomplish 
this only on a small scale but we have ample reason 
to conclude that the same operation if conducted in 
natures great laboratory would equally produce the 
effect 

and finally even on that great scale we are able 
to verify the result the case is one of those rare 
cases as we have shown them to be in which nature 
works the experiment for us in the same manner in 
which we ourselves perform it introducing into the 
previous state of things a lingle and perfectly definite 
new circumstance and manifesting the effect so rapidly 
that there is not time for any other material change 
in the preexisting circumstances let us quote again 
sir john herschel — it is observed that dew is never 
copiously deposited in situations much screened from 
the open sky and not at all in a cloudy night but 
if the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes and leave 
a clear opening a deposition of dew presently begins 
and goes on increasing dew formed in clear 
intervals will often even evaporate again when the 
sky becomes thickly overcast the proof therefore 
is complete that the presence or absence of an unin 
terrupted communication with the sky causes the 
deposition or nondeposition of dew now since a 
clear sky is nothing but the absence of clouds and 

digitized by vjooq ic 



 induction 

it is a known property of clouds as of all other bodies 
between which and any given object nothing inter 
venes but an elastic fluid that they tend to raise or 
keep up the superficial temperature of the object by 
radiating heat to it we see at once that the disappear 
ance of clouds will cause the surface to cool so that 
nature in this case produces a change in the ante 
cedent by definite and known means and the conse 
quent fouows accordingly a naturcd experiment which 
satisfies the requisitions of the method of difference 
the accumulated proof of which the theory of 
dew has been found susceptible is a striking example 
of the fulness of assurance which the inductive 
evidence of laws of causation may attain in cas in 
which the invariable sequence is by no means obvious 



 i must however remark that this example which seems to 
militate against the assertion we made of the comparative inappli 
cability of the method of difference to cases of pure observation is 
really one of those exceptions which according to a proverbiid 
expression prove the general rule for be it observed in this 
case in whicih nature in her experiment seems to have imitated 
e type of the experiments made by man she has only succeeded 
in producing the likeness of mans most imperfect experiments 
namely those in which though he succeeds in producing the pheno 
menon he docs so by employing complex means which he is unable 
perfectly to analyze and can form therefore no sufficient judgment 
what portion of the effects may be due not to the supposed cause 
but to some unknown agency of the means by which that cause was 
produced in the natural experiment which we are speaking o 
the means used was the clearing off a canopy of clouds and we 
certainly do not know sufficiently in what this process consists or 
upon what it depends to be certain d priori that it might not 
operate upon the deposition of dew independently of any thermo 
metric effect at the earths surfsetce even therefore in a case so 
favourable as this to natures experimental talents her experiment 
is of little value except in corroboration of a conclusion abready 
attained through other means

to a superficial view it is unnecessary to subjoin 
sir john herschels summary of the result as it does 
not contain all the proofs which i have given and 
our more detailed analysis of each step of the process 
renders such a recapitulation unnecessary 

 this admirable example will have conveyed 
to any one by whom it has been duly followed so 
clear a conception of the use and practical manage 
ment of three of the four methods of experimental 
inquiry as to supersede the necessity of any further 
exemplification of them the remaining method 
that of residues not having found any place either 
in this or in the two preceding investigations i shall 
extract from sir john herschel some examples of 
that method with the remarks by which they are 
introduced 

 it is by this process in fact that science in its 
present advanced state is chiefly promoted most of 
the phenomena which nature presents are very com 
plicated and when the effects of all known causes 
are estimated with exactness and subducted the 
residual facts are constantly appearing in the form of 
phenomena altogether new and leading to the most 
important conclusions 

 for example the return of the comet predicted 
by professor encke a great many times in succession 
and the general good agreement of its calculated with 
its observed place during any one of its periods of 
visibility would lead us to say that its gravitation 
towards the sun and planets is the sole and sufficient 
cause of all the phenomena of its orbitual motion 
but when the effect of this cause is strictly calculated 
and subducted from the observed motion there is

found to remain behind a remdual phenomewm which 
would never have been otherwise ascertained to exist 
which is a small anticipation of the time of its reqv 
pearance or a diminution of its periodic time whidi 
cannot be accounted for by gravity and whose cause 
is therefore to be inquired into such an anticipation 
would be caused by the resistance of a medium dis 
seminated through the celestial rons and as th 
are other good reasons for believing this to be a vera 
causa an actually existing antecedent it has 
therefore been ascribed to such a resistance 

 m arago having suspended a magnetic needle 
by a silk thread and set it in vibration observed that 
it came much sooner to a state of rest when suspended 
over a plate of copper than when no such plate was 
beneath it now in both cases there were two vera 
causa antecedents known to exist why it should 
come at length to rest viz the resistance the air 
which opposes and at length destroys all motions 
performed in it and the want of perfect mobility 
in the silk thread but the effect of these causes 
being exactly known by the observation made in the 
absence of tiie copper and being thus allowed for and 
subducted a residual phenomenon appeared in the 
fact that a retarding influence was exerted by the 
copper itself and this fact once ascertained speedily 
led to the knowledge of an entirely new and unex 
pected class of relations this example belongs 
however not to the method of residues but to the 
method of difference the law being ascertained by a 
direct comparison of the results of two experiments 
which differed in nothing but the presence or absence 
of the plate of copper to have made it exemplify 
the method of residues the effect of the resistance

of the air and that of the rigidity of the silk should 
have been calculated d priori from the laws obtained 
by separate and foregone experiments 

 unexpected and peculiarly striking confirmations 
of inducve laws frequently occur in the form of 
residual phenomena in the course of investigations of 
a widely different nature from those which gave rise 
to the inductions themselves a very elegant example 
may be cited in the unexpected confirmation of the 
law of the developement of heat in elastic fluids by 
compression which is afforded by the phenomena of 
sound the inquiry into the cause of sound had led 
to conclusions respecting its mode of propagation 
from which its velocity in the air could be precisely 
calculated the calculations were performed but 
when compared with fact though the agreement was 
quite sufficient to show the general correctness of the 
cause and mode of propagation assigned yet the whole 
velocity could not be shown to arise from this theory 
there was still a residual velocity to be accounted for 
which placed dynamical philosophers for a long time 
in a great dilemma at length laplace struck on the 
happy idea that this might arise from the heat deve 
loped in the act of that condensation which necessarily 
takes place at every vibration by which sound is 
conveyed the matter was subjected to exact calcu 
lation and the result was at once the complete expla 
nation of the residual phenomenon and a striking 
confirmation of the general law of the developement 
of heat by compression under circumstances beyond 
artificial imitation

the disturbing effects mutually produced by the 
earth and planets upon each others motions were 
first brought to light as residual phenomena by the 
difference which appeared between the observed places 
of those bodies and the places calculated on a con 
sideration solely of their gravitation towards the sun 
it was this which determined philosophers to consider 
the law of gravitation as obtaining between all bodies 
whatever and therefore between all particles of matter 
their first tendency having been to regard it as a force 
acting only between each planet or satellite and the 
central body to whose system it belonged again the 
catastrophists in geology be their opinion right or 
wrong support it upon the plea that after the efilect 
of all causes now in operation has been allowed for 
there remains in the existing constitution of the earth 
a large residue of fietcts proving the existence at 
former periods either of other forces or of the same 
forces in a much greater degree of intensity to add 
one more example if it be possible to establish what

we in fact see all that can be traced by known laws 
either to the ascertained differences of physical 
organization or to the differences which have existed 
in the outward circumstances in which the subjects 
of the comparison have hitherto been placed what 
these causes might fail to account for would constitute 
a residual phenomenon which and which alone would 
be evidence of an ulterior original distinction and the 
measure of its amount but the strongest assertors

negligent of providing themselves with these neces

of plurality of causes and of the 
intermixture of effects 

§ in the preceding exposition of the four 
methods of observation and experiment by which we 
contrive to distinguish among a mass of coexistent 
phenomena tlie particular eflfect due to a given cause 
or the particular cause which gave birth to a given 
eflfect it has been necessary to suppose in the first 
instance for the sake of simplification that this ana 
lytical operation is encumbered by no other difficulties 
than what are essentially inherent in its nature and 
to represent to ourselves therefore every efiect on 
the one hand as connected exclusively with a single 
cause and on the other hand as incapable of being 
mixed and confounded with any other coexistent 
effect we have regarded a ft c c e the aggregate of 
the phenomena existing at any moment as consisting 
of dissimilar facts a ft c d and e for each of which 
one and only one cause needs be sought the diffi 
culty being only that of singung out this one cause 
from the multitude of antecedent circumstances a b 
c d and e 

if such were the fact it would be comparatively 
an easy task to investigate the laws of nature but 
the supposition does not hold in either of its parts 
in the first place it is not true that the same pheno 
menon is always produced by the same cause the 
effect a may sometimes arise from a sometimes horn 
b and secondly the effects of different causes are 
often not dissimilar but homogeneous and marked

out by no assignable boundaries from one another a 
and b may produce not a and by but diflferent portions 
of an effect a the obscurity and difficulty of the 
investigation of the laws of phenomena is singularly 
increased by the necessity of adverting to these two 
circumstances intermixture of effects and plurality 
of causes to the latter being the simpler of the 
two considerations we shall first direct our attention 
it is not true then that one effect must be 
connected with only one cause or assemblage of con 
ditions that each phenomenon can be produced only 
in one way there are often several independent 
modes in which the same phenomenon could have 
originated one fact may be the consequent in 
several invariable sequences it may follow with 
equal uniformity any one of several antecedents or 
collections of antecedents many causes may pro 
duce motion many causes may produce some kinds 
of sensation many causes may produce death a 
given effect may really be produced by a certain 
cause and yet be perfectly capable of being produced 
without it 

§ one of the principal consequences of this 
fact of plurality of causes is to render the first of our 
inductive methods that of agreement uncertain to 
illustrate that method we supposed two instances 
abc followed by a c and a d e followed by a d 
from these instances it might be concluded that a 
is an invariable antecedent of a and even that it 
is the unconditional invariable antecedent or cause if 
we could be sure that there is no other antecedent 
common to the two cases that this difficulty may 
not stand in the way let us suppose the two cases 
positively ascertained to have no antecedent in com

mon except a the moment however that we let 
in the possibility of a plurality of causes the conclu 
sion fails for it involves a tacit supposition that a 
must have been produced in both instances by the 
same cause if there can possibly have been two 
causes those two may for example be c and e the 
one may have been the cause of a in the former of the 
instances the other in the latter a having no influ 
ence in either case 

suppose for example that two great artists or great 
philosophers that two extremely selfish or extremely 
generous characters were compared together as to the 
circumstances of their education and history and the 
two cases were found to agree only in one circumstance 
would it follow that this one circumstance was the 
cause of the quality which characterized both those 
individuals not at all for the causes at work to 
produce any given type of character are innumerable 
and the two persons might equally have agreed in 
their character although there had been no manner 
of resemblance in their previous history 

this therefore is a characteristic imperfection of 
the method of agreement from which imperfection 
the method of difference is free for if we have two 
instances abc and b c of which b c gives b c 
and a being added converts it into ab cit is certain 
that in this instance at least a was either the cause 
of a or an indispensable portion of its cause evi 
though the cause which produces it in other instances 
may be altogether different plurality of causes 
therefore not only does not diminish the reliance due 
to the method of difference but does not even render 
a greater number of observations or experiments 
necessary two instances the one positive and the 
other negative are still sufficient for the most com

plete and rigorous induction not so however with 
the method of agreement the conclusions which 
that yields when the number of instances compared is 
small are of no real value except as in the character 
of suggestions they may lead either to experiments 
bringing them to the test of the method of difference 
or to reasonings which may explain and verify them 
deductively 

it is only when the instances being indefinitely 
multiplied and varied continue to suggest the same 
result that this result acquires any high degree of 
independent value if there are but two instances 
abc and a d e although these instances have no 
antecedent in common except a yet as the effect 
may possibly have been produced in the two cases by 
different causes the result is at most only a sught 
probability in favour of a there may be causation 
but it is almost equally probable that there was only 
as the expression is a coincidence but the oftener 
we repeat the observation varying the circumstances 
the more we advance towards a solution of this doubt 
for if we try a f g a h k c all entirely unlike 
one another except in containing the circumstance 
a and if we find the effect a entering into the result 
in all these cases we must suppose one of two 
things either that it is caused by a or that it has as 
many different causes as there are instances with 
each addition therefore to the number of instances 
the presumption is strengthened in favour of a the 
inquirer of course will not neglect if an opportunity 
present itself to exclude a from some one of these 
combinations from a h k for instance and by 
trying h k separately appeal to the method of 
difference in aid of the method of agreement by 
the former method alone can it be ascertained that a

is the cause of a but that it is either the cause or 
another eflfect of the same cause may be placed 
beyond any reasonable doubt by the method of agree 
ment provided the instances are very numerous as 
well as sufficiently various 

after how great a multiplication then of varied 
instances all agreeing in no other antecedent except 
a is the supposition of a plurality of causes suffi 
ciently rebutted and the conclusion that a is the 
effect of a divested of the characteristic imperfection 
and reduced to a virtual certainty this is a ques 
tion which we cannot be exempted from answering 
but the consideration of it belongs to what is called 
the theory of probability which will form the subject 
of a chapter hereafter it is seen however at once 
that the conclusion does amount to a practical 
certainty after a sufficient number of instances and 
that the method therefore is not radically vitiated 
by the characteristic imperfection the result of 
these considerations is only in the first place to 
point out a new source of inferiority in the method of 
agreement as compared with other modes of investi 
gation and new reasons for never resting contented 
with the results obtained by it without attempting to 
confirm them either by the method of difference or 
by connecting them deductively with some law or 
laws already ascertained by that superior method 
and in the second place we learn from this 
the true theory of the value of mere number of 
instances in inductive inquiry the tendency of 
unscientific inquirers is to rely too much upon num 
ber without analysing the instances without looking 
closely enough into their nature to ascertain what 
circumstances are or are not eliminated by means of 
them most people hold their conclusions with a

degree of assurance proportioned to the mere mass of 
the experience on which they appear to rest not 
considering that by the addition of instances to 
instances all of the same kind that is di£pering from 
one another only in points already recognised as 
immaterial nothing whatever is added to the evidence 
of the conclusion a single instance eliminating some 
antecedent which existed in all the other cases is of 
more value than the greatest multitude of instances 
which are reckoned by their number alone it is 
necessary no doubt to assure ourselves by a repeti 
tion of the observation or experiment that no error 
has been committed concerning the individual facts 
observed and until we have assured ourselves of this 
instead of varying the circumstances we cannot too 
scrupulously repeat the same experiment or obser 
vation without any change but when once this 
assurance htus been obtained the multiplication of 
instances which do not exclude any more circum 
stances would be entirely useless were it not for the 
plurality of causes 

it is of importance to remark that the peculiar 
modification of the method of agreement which as 
partaking in some degree of the nature of the method 
of difference i have called the joint method of agree 
ment and difference is not affected by the charac 
teristic imperfection now pointed out for in the 
joint method it is supposed not only that the instances 
in which a is agree only in containing a but also 
that the instances in which a is not agree only in not 
containing a now if this be so a must be not 
only the cause of a but the only possible cause for 
if there were another as for example b then in the 
instances in which a is not b must have been absent 
as well as a and it would not be true that these

instances agree only in not containing a this there 
fore constitutes an immense advantage of the joint 
method over the simple method of agreement it 
may seem indeed that the advantage does not belong 
so much to the joint method as to one of its two pre 
misses if they may be so called the negative premiss 
the method of agreement when apphed to negative 
instances or those in which a phenomenon does not 
take place is certainly free from the characteristic 
imperfection which affects it in the affirmative case 
the negative premiss it might therefore be supposed 
could be worked as a simple case of the method of 
agreement without requiring an affirmative premiss 
to be joined with it but although this is true in 
principle it is generally altogether impossible to woric 
the method of agreement by negative instances with 
out positive ones it is so much more difficult to 
exhaust the field of negation than that of affirmation 
for instance let the question be what is the cause 
of the transparency of bodies with what prospect of 
success could we set ourselves to inquire directly in 
what the multifarious substances which are not trans 
parent agree but we might hope much sooner to 
seize some point of resemblance among the compara 
tively few and definite species of objects which are 
transparent and this being attained we should quite 
naturally be put upon examining whether the absence 
of this one circumstance be not precisely the point in 
which all opaque substances will be found to re 
semble 

the joint method of agreement and difference 
therefore or as i have otherwise called it the indirect 
method of difference because like the method of 
difference properly so called it proceeds by ascertain 
ing how and in what the cases where the phenomenon

is present differ from those in which it is absent is 
after the direct method of difference the most power 
ful of the remaining instruments of inductive investi 
gation and in the sciences which depend on pure 
observation with little or no aid from experiment 
this method so well exemplified in the beautiful 
speculation on the cause of dew is the primary re 
source so far as direct appeals to experience are 
concerned 

 we have thus far treated plurality of causes 
only as a possible supposition which until removed 
renders our inductions uncertain and have only con 
sidered by what means where the plurality does not 
really exist we may be enabled to disprove it but 
we must also consider it as a case actually occurring 
in nature and which as often as it does occur our 
methods of induction ought to be capable of ascer 
taining and establishing for this however there is 
required no peculiar method when an effect is really 
producible by two or more causes the process for 
detecting them is in no way different from that by 
which we discover single causes they may first be 
discovered as separate sequences by separate sets of 
instances one set of observations or experiments 
shows that the sun is a cause of heat another that 
friction is a source of it another that percussion anor 
ther that electricity another that chemical action is such 
a source or secondly the plurality may come to light 
in the course of collating a number of instances when 
we attempt to find some circumstance in which they 
all agree and fail in doing so we find it impossible 
to trace in all the cases in which the effect is met 
with any common circumstance we find that we 
can eliminate all the antecedents that no one of them

is present in all the instances no one of them indis 
pensable to the effect on closer scrutiny however 
it appears that though no one is always present one 
or other of several always is if on farther analysis 
we can detect in these any common element we may 
be able to ascend from them to some one cause which 
is the really operative circumstance in them all thus 
it might and perhaps will be discovered that in the 
production of heat by friction percussion chemical 
action c the ultimate source is one and the same 
but if as continually happens we cannot take this 
ulterior step the different antecedents must be set 
down as distinct causes each sufficient of itself to 
produce the effect 

we may here close our remarks on the plurahty 
of causes and proceed to the still more peculiar and 
more complex case of the intermixture of effects and 
the interference of causes with one another a case 
constituting the principal part of the complication and 
difficulty of the study of nature and with which the 
four only possible methods of directly inductive inves 
tigation by observation and experiment are for the 
most part as will appear presently quite unequal to 
cope the instrument of deduction alone is adequate 
to unravel the complexities proceeding from this 
source and the four methods have uttle more in their 
power than to supply premisses for our deductions 

 a concurrence of two or more causes not 
separately producing each its own effect but interfer 
ing with or modifying the effects of one another takes 
place as has already been explained in two different 
ways in the one case which is exemplified by the 
joint operatioaof different forces in mechanics the sepa 
rate effects of all the causes continue to be produced

but are compounded with one another and disappear 
in one total in the other case illustrated by the case 
of chemical action the separate effects cease entirely 
and are succeeded by phenomena altogether different 
and governed by different laws 

of these cases the former is by far the more fre 
quent and this case it is which for the most part 
eludes the grasp of our experimental methods the 
other and exceptional case is essentially amenable to 
them when the laws of the original agents cease 
entirely and a phenomenon makes its appearance 
which with reference to those laws is quite hetero 
geneous when for example two gaseous substances 
hydrogen and oxygen on being brought together 
throw off their peculiar properties and produce the 
substance called water in such cases the new fact 
may be subjected to experimental inquiry like any 
other phenomenon and the elements which are said 
to compose it may be considered as the mere agents 
of its production the conditions on which it depends 
the facts which make up its cause 

the effects of the new phenomenon the properties 
of water for instance are as easily found by experi 
ment as the effects of any other cause but to 
discover the came of it that is the particular conjunc 
tion of agents from which it results is often difficult 
enough in the first place the origin and actual 
production of the phenomenon is most frequently 
inaccessible to our observation if we could not have 
learned the composition of water until we found in 
stances in which it was actually produced from oxygen 
and hydrogen we should have been forced to wait 
until the casual thought struck some one of passing an 
electric spark through a mixture of the two gases or 
inserting a lighted taper into it merely to try what

would happen further even if we could have ascer 
tainedy by the method of agreement that oxygen and 
hydrogen were both present when water is produced 
no experimentation on oxygen and hydrogen sepa 
rately no knowledge of their laws could have enabled 
us deductively to infer that they would produce water 
we require a specific experiment on the two com 
bined 

under these difficulties we should generally have 
been indebted for our knowledge of the causes of this 
class of eflfects not to any inquiry directed specifically 
towards that end but either to accident or to the 
gradual progress of experimentation on the different 
combinations of which the producing agents are sus 
ceptible if it were not for a peculiarity belonging to 
effects of this description that they often under some 
particular combination of circumstances reproduce 
their causes if water results from the juxta position 
of hydrogen and oxygen whenever this can be made 
sufficiently close and intimate so on the other hand 
if water itself be placed in certain situations hydrogen 
and oxygen are reproduced from it an abrupt termi 
nation is put to the new laws arid the agents re 
appear separately with their own properties as at 
first what is called chemical analysis is the process 
of searching for the causes of a phenomenon among 
its eflfects or rather among the eflfects produced by the 
action of some other causes upon it 

lavoisier by heating mercury to a high tempera 
ture in a close vessel containing air found that the 
mercury increased in weight and became what was 
then called red precipitate while the air on being 
examined after the experiment proved to have lost 
weight and to have become incapable of supporting 
life or combustion when red precipitate was exposed

to a still greater heat it became mercury again and gave 
off a gas which did support life and flame thus the 
agents which by their combination produced red pre 
cipitate namely the mercury and the gas reappear as 
effects resulting from that precipitate when acted upon 
by heat so if we decompose water by means of iron 
filings we produce two effects rust and hydrogen now 
rust is already known by experiments upon the com 
ponent substances to be an effect of the union of iron 
and oxygen the iron we ourselves suppued but the 
oxygen must have been produced from the water 
the result therefore is that the water has disappeared 
and hydrogen and oxygen have appeared in its stead 
or in other words the original laws of these gaseous 
agents which had been suspended by the superinduc 
tion of the new laws called the properties of water 
have again started into existence and the causes of 
water are found among its effects 

where two phenomena between the laws or pro 
perties of which considered in themselves no con 
nexion can be traced are thus reciprocally cause and 
effect each capable in its turn of being produced from 
the other and each when it produces the other ceasing 
itself to exist as water is produced from oxygen and 
hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen are reproduced 
from water this causation of the two phenomena by 
one another each of them being generated by the 
others destruction is properly transformation the 
idea of chemical composition is an idea of transforma 
tion but of a transformation which is incomplete 
since we consider the oxygen and hydrogen to be pre 
sent in the water as oxygen and hydrogen and capable 
of being discovered in it if our senses were sufficiently 
keen a supposition for it is no more grounded solely 
upon the fact that the weight of the water is the sum

of the separate weights of the two ingredients if 
there had not been this exception to the entire disap 
pearance in the compound of the laws of the separate 
ingredients if the combined agents had not in this 
one particular of weight preserved their own laws 
and produced a joint result equal to the sum of their 
separate results we should never probably have had 
the notion now implied by the words chemical com 
position and in the fact of water produced from 
hydrogen and oxygen and hydrogen and oxygen pro 
duced from water as the transformation would have 
been complete we should have seen only a trans 
formation 

in these casesj then when the heteropathic effect 
as we called it in a former chapter is but a trans 
formation of its cause or in other words when the 
effect and its cause sure reciprocally such and mutu 
ally convertible into each other the problem of 
finding the cause resolves itself into the far easier one 
of finding an effect which is the kind of inquiry that 
admits of being prosecuted by direct experiment but 
there are other cases of heteropathic effects to which 
this mode of investigation is not applicable take for 
instance the heteropathic laws of mind that portion 
of the phenomena of our mental nature which are 
analogous to chemical rather than to dynamical phe 
nomena as when a complex passion is formed by the 
coalition of several elementary impulses or a complex 
emotion by several simple pleasures or pains of which 
it is the result without being the aggregate or in any 
respect homogeneous with thenu the product in 
these cases is generated by its various factors but 
the factors cannot be reproduced from the product

man cannot grow into a youth we cannot ascertain

from what simple feelings any of our complex states 
of mind are generated as we ascertain the ingredients 
of a chemical compound by making it in its turn 
generate them we can only therefore discover 
these laws by the slow process of studying the simple 
feelings themselves and ascertaining synthetically by 
experimenting on the various combinations of which 
they are susceptible what they by their mutual 
action upon one another are capable of generating 

§ it might have been supposed that the other 
and apparently simpler variety of the mutual inter 
ference of causes where each cause continues to pro 
duce its own proper effect according to the same laws 
to which it conforms in its separate state would have 
presented fewer difficulties to the inductive inquirer 
than that of which we have just finished the consider 
aticm it presents however so far as direct induction 
apart from deduction is concerned infinitely greater 
difficulties when a concurrence of causes gives rise 
to a new efiect bearing no relatiui to the separate 
effects of those causes the resultii phenomenon at 
least stands forth undisguised inviting attention to its 
peculiarity and presenting no obstacle to our recog 
nising its presence or absence among any number of 
surrounding phenomena it admits therefore of being 
easily brought under the canons of induction provided 
instances can be obtained such as those canons require 
and the nonoccurrence of such instances or the want 
of means to produce them artificially is the real and 
only difficulty in such investigations a difficulty not 
logical but in some sort physical it is otherwise 
with cases of what in a preceding chapter has been 
denominated the composition of causes there the 
effects of the separate causes do not terminate and

give place to others thereby ceasing to form any part 
of the phenomenon to be investigated on the con 
trary they still take place but are intermingled with 
and disguised by the homogeneous and closelyalhed 
effects of other causes they are no longer a c d e 
existing side by side and continuing to be separately 
discernible they are a — a — c some 
of which cancel one another while many others do 
not appear distinguishabiy but merge in one sum 
forming altogether a result between which and the 
causes whereby it was produced there is often an 
insurmountable difficulty in tracing by observation any 
fixed relation whatever 

the general idea of the composition of causes has 
been seen to be that although two or more laws 
interfere with one another and apparently frustrate 
or modify one anothers operation yet in reality all 
are fulfilled the collective effect being the exact sum 
total of the effects of the causes taken separately a 
familiar instance is that of a body kept in equilibrium 
by two equal and contrary forces one of the forces 
if acting alone would carry it so far to the west the 
other if acting alone would carry it exactly as far 
towards the east and the result is the same as if it 
had been first carried to the west as far as the one 
force would carry it and then back towards the east 
as far as the other would carry it that is precisely 
the same distance being ultimately left where it was 
found at first 

all laws of causation are liable to be in this 
manner counteracted and seemingly frustrated by 
coming into conflict with other laws the separate 
result of which is opposite to theirs or more or less 
inconsistent with it and hence with almost every 
law many instances in which it really is entirely

fulfilled do not at first sight appear to be cases of 
its operation at all it is so in the example just 
adduced a force in mechanics means neither more 
nor less than a cause of motion yet the sum of the 
effects of two causes of motion may be rest again 
a body solicited by two forces in directions making 
an angle with one another moves in the diago 
nal and it seems a paradox to say that motion in 
the diagonal is the sum of two motions in two other 
lines motion however is but change of place and 
at every instant the body is in the exact place it 
would have been in if the forces had acted during 
alternate instants instead of acting in the same in 
stant saving that if we suppose two forces to act suc 
cessively which are in truth simultaneous we must of 
course allow them double the time it is evident 
therefore that each force has had during each instant 
all the effect which belonged to it and that the modi 
fying influence which one of two concurrent causes is 
said to exercise with respect to the other may be 
considered as exerted not over the action of the cause 
itself but over the effect after it is completed for 
all purposes of predicting calculating or explaining 
their joint result causes which compoimd their effects 
may be treated as if they produced simultaneously 
each of them its own effect and all these effects co 
existed visibly 

since the laws of causes are as really fulfilled when 
the causes are said to be coimteracted by opposing 
causes as when they are left to their own undisturbed 
action we must be cautious not to express the laws in 
such terms as would render the assertion of their being 
fulfilled in those cases a contradiction if for in 
stance it were stated as a law of nature that a body 
to which a force is applied moves in the direction of

the force with a velocity proportioned to the force 
directly and to its own mass inversely when in point 
of fact some bodies to which a force is applied do not 
move at all and those which do move are from the 
very first retarded by the action of gravity and other 
resisting forces and at last stopped altogether it is 
clear that the general proposition although it would 
be true under a certain hypothesis would not express 
the facts as they actually occur to acconmiodate 
the expression of the law to the real phenomena we 
must say not that the object moves but that it tends 
to move in the direction and with the velocity speci 
fied we might indeed guard our expression in a 
different mode by saying that the body moves in that 
manner unless prevented or except in so fieur as pre 
vented by some coimteracting cause but the body 
does not only move in that manner unless counter 
acted it tends to move in that manner even when 
counteracted it still exerts in the original direction 
the same energy of movement as if its first impulse 
had been undisturbed and produces by that energy 
an exactly equivalent quantity of effisct this is true 
eveia when the force leaves the body as it foimd it in 
a state of absolute rest as when we attempt to raise 
a body of three tons weight with a force equal to one 
ton for if while we are applying this force the wind 
or water or any other agent supplies an additional 
force just exceeding two tons the body will be raised 
thus proving that the force we applied exerted its full 
effect by neutralizing an equivalent portion of the 
weight which it was insufficient altogether to over 
come and if while we are exerting this force of one 
ton upon the object in a direction contrary to that of 
gravity it be put into a scale and weighed it will be 
found to have lost a ton of its weight or in other

words to press downwards with a force only equal to 
the diiserence of the two forces 

these facts are correctly indicated by the expres 
sion tendency all laws of causation in consequence 
of their liability to be counteracted require to be 
stated in words affirmative of tendencies only and not 
of actual results in those sciences of causation 
which have an accurate nomenclature there are spe 
cial words which signify a tendency to the particular 
effect with which the science is conversant thus 
pressurey in mechanics is synonymous with tendency 
to motion and forces are not reasoned upon as causing 
actual motion but as exerting pressure a similar 
improvement in terminology would be very salutary 
in many other branches of science 

the habit of neglecting this necessary element in 
the precise expression of the laws of nature has given 
birth to the popular prejudice that all general truths 
have exceptions and much unmerited distrust has 
thence accrued to the conclusions of philosophy when 
they have been submitted to the judgment of persons 
who were not philosophers the rough generaliza 
tions suggested by common observation usually have 
exceptions but the principles of science or in other 
words the laws of causation have not what is 
thought to be an exception to a principle to quote 
words used on a different occasion is always some 
other and distinct principle cutting into the former 
some other force which impinges against the first force 
and deflects it from its direction there are not a 
law and an exception to that law the law acting in 
ninetynine cases and the exception in one there 
are two laws each possibly actii in the whole hun 
dred cases and bringing about a common effect by 
their conjunct operation if the force which being

the less conspicuous of the two is called the disturb 
ing force prevails sufficiently over the other force in 
some one case to constitute that case what is com 
monly called an exception the same disturbing force 
probably acts as a modifying cause in many other cases 
which no one will call exceptions 

 thus if it were stated to be a law of nature that 
au heavy bodies fall to the groimd it would probably 
be said that the resistance of the atmosphere which 
prevents a balloon from falling constitutes the balloon 
an exception to that pretended law of nature but 
the real law is that all heavy bodies tend to fall and 
to this there is no exception not even the sun and 
moon for even they as every astronomer knows 
tend towards the earth with a force exactly equal to 
that with which the earth tends towards them the 
resistance of the atmosphere might in the particular 
case of the balloon from a misapprehension of what 
the law of gravitation is be said to prevail over the 
law but its disturbing effect is quite as real in every 
other case since though it does not prevent it retards 
the fall of all bodies whatever the rule and the 
socalled exception do not divide the cases between 
them each of them is a comprehensive rule extend 
ing to all cases to call one of these concurrent 
principles an exception to the other is superficial and 
contrary to the correct principles of nomenclature and 
arrangement an effect of precisely the same kind and 
arising from the same cause ought not to be placed 
in two different categories merely as there does or does 
not exist another cause preponderating over it

method these complex effects compounded of the 
effects of many causes are to be studied how we are

enabled to trace each effect to the concurrence of 
causes in which it originated and ascertain the con 
ditions of its recurrence the circumstances in which 
it may be expected again to occur the conditions 
of a phenomenon which arises from a composition 
of causes may be investigated either deductively or 
experimentally 

the case it is evident is naturally susceptible of 
the deductive mode of investigation the law of an 
effect of this description is a result of the laws of the 
separate causes on the combination of which it depends 
and is therefore in itself capable of being deduced 
from these laws this is called the method a priori 
the other or a posteriori method professes to pro 
ceed according to the canons of experimental inquiry 
considering the whole assemblage of concurrent 
causes which produced the phenomenon as one single 
cause it attempts to ascertain that cause in the ordi 
nary manner by a comparison of instances this 
second method subdivides itself into two different 
varieties if it merely collates instances of the effect 
it is a method of pure observation if it operates 
upon the causes and tries different combinations of 
them in hopes of ultimately hitting the precise combi 
nation which will produce the given total effect it is 
a method of experiment 

in order more completely to clear up the nature of 
each of these three methods and determine which of 
them deserves the preference it will be expedient 
conformably to a favourite maxim of lord chancellor 
eldon to which though it has often incurred philo 
sophical ridicule a deeper philosophy will not refuse 
its sanction to clothe them in circumstances 
we shall select for this purpose a case which as yet 
furnishes no very brilliant example of the success of

any of the three methods but which is all the more 
suited to illustrate the difficulties inherent in them 
let the subject of inquiry be the conditions of health 
and disease in the human body or for greater sim 
plicity the conditions of recovery from a given dis 
ease and in order to narrow the question still more 
let it be limited in the first instance to this one 
inquiry is or is not some particular medicament 
mercury for instance a remedy for that disease 

now the deductive method would set out from 
known properties of mercury and known laws of the 
human body and by reasoning firom these would 
attempt to discover whether mercury will act upon 
the body when in the morbid condition supposed in 
such a manner as to restore health the experi 
mental method would simply administer mercury in 
as many cases as possible noting the age sex tempe 
rament and other peculiarities of bodily constitution 
the particular form or variety of the disease the par 
ticular stage of its progress c remarking in which 
of these cases it produced a salutary effect and with 
what circumstances it was on those occasions com 
bined the method of simple observation would com 
pare instances of recovery to find whether they agreed 
in having been preceded by the administration of mer 
cury or would compare instances of recovery with 
instances of failure to find cases which agreeing in 
all other respects differed only in the fact that mer 
cury had been administered or that it had not

tigation is applicable to the case no one has ever seri

impression for or against the efficacy of mercury of 
no real avail for guidance unless confirmed by one of 
the other two methods not that the results which this 
method strives to obtain would not be of the utmost 
possible value if they could be obtained if all the cases 
of recovery which presented themselves in an examina 
tion extending to a great number of instances were 
cases in which mercury had been administered we 
might generalize with confidence from this experience 
and should have obtained a conclusion of real value 
but no such basis for generalization can we in a case 
of this description hope to obtain the reason is 
that which we have so often spoken of as constituting 
the characteristic imperfection of the method of agree 
ment plurality of causes supposing even that 
mercury does tend to cure the disease so many other 
causes both natural and artificial also tend to cure it 
that there are sure to be abundant instances of reco 
very in which mercury has not been administered 
unless indeed the practice be to administer it in all 
cases on which supposition it will equally be found 
in the cases of failure 

when an effect results from the union of many 
causes the share which each has in the determination 
of the effect cannot in general be great and the effect 
is not likely even in its presence or absence still less 
in its variations to follow very exactly any one of the 
causes recovery from a disease is an event to which 
in every case many influences must concur mercury 
may be one such influence but from the very fact 
that there are many other such it will necessarily 
happen that although mercury is administered the 
patient for want of other concurring influences will 
often not recover and that he often will recover when 
it is not administered the other favourable influences

being sufficiently powerfiil without it neither there 
fore will the instances of recovery agree in the admi 
nistration of mercury nor will the instances of failure 
agree in the nonadmmistration of it it is much if 
by multiplied and accurate returns from hospitals and 
the like we can collect that there are rather more 
recoveries and rather fewer failures when mercury is 
administered than when it is not a result of very 
secondary value even as a guide to practice and almost 
worthless as a contribution to the theory of the subject 

§ the inappucability of the method of simple 
observation to ascertain the conditions of effects de 
pendent on many concurring causes being thus recog 
nised we shall next inquire whether any greater 
benefit can be expected from the other branch of the 
ct posteriori method that which proceeds by directly 
trying diflferent combinations of causes either arti 
ficially produced or found in nature and takmg notice 
what is their eflfect as for example by actually trying 
the eflfect of mercury in as many different circum 
stances as possible this method differs from the one 
which we have just examined in turning our attention 
directly to the causes or agents instead of turning it to 
the eflfect recovery from the disease and since as a 
general rule the effects of causes are far more acces 
sible to our study than the causes of effects it is 
natural to think that this method may be successful 
although the former must necessarily fail 

the method now under consideration is called the 
empirical method and in order to estimate it fairly 
we must suppose it to be completely not incom 
pletely empirical we must exclude from it every 
thing which partakes of the nature not of an expe 
rimental but of a deductive operation if for instance

we tiy experiments with mercury upon a person in 
health in order to ascertain the general laws of its 
action upon the human body and then reason from 
these laws to determine how it will act upon persons 
affected with a particular disease this may be a really 
effectual method but this is deduction the experi 
mental method does not derive the law of a complex 
case from the simpler laws which conspire to pro 
duce it but makes its experiments directly upon the 
complex case we must make entire abstraction of 
all knowledge of the simpler tendencies the modi 
operandi of mercury in detail our experimentation 
must aim at obtaining a direct answer to the specific 
question does or does not mercury tend to cure the 
particular disease 

let us see therefore how far this case admits of the 
observance of those rules of experimentation which it 
is found necessary to observe in other cases when 
we devise an experiment to ascertain the effect of a 
given agent there are certain precautions which we 
never if we can help it omit in the first place we 
introduce the agent into the midst of a set of circum 
stances which we have exactly ascertained it needs 
hardly be remarked how far this condition is from 
being realized in any case connected with the pheno 
mena of life how far we are from knowing what are 
all the circumstances which preexist in any instance 
in which mercury is administered to a living being 
this diificulty however though insuperable in most 
cases may not be so in all there are sometimes though 
i should think never in physiology concurrences 
of many causes in which we yet know accurately 
what the causes are but when we have got clear of 
this obstacle we encounter another still more serious 
in other cases when we intend to try an experiment 

vol i dimygoogle 



 induction 

we do not reckon it enough that there be no circum 
stance in the case the presence of which is unknown 
to us we require also that none of the circum 
stances which we do know of shall have effects 
susceptible of being confounded with those of the 
agent whose properties we wish to study we take 
the utmost pains to exclude all causes capable of 
composition with the given cause or if forced to let 
in any such causes we take care to make them such 
that we can compute and allow for their influence so 
that the effect of the given cause may after the sub 
duction of those other effects be apparent as a 
residual phenomenon 

these precautions are inapplicable to such cases 
as we are now considering the mercury of our 
experiment being tried with an unknown multitude 
or even let it be a known multitude of other influ 
encing circumstances the mere fact of their being 
influencing circumstances implies that they disguise 
the effect of the mercury and preclude us from 
knowing whether it has any effect or no unless we 
already knew what and how much is owing to every 
other circumstance that is unless we suppose the 
very problem solved which we are considering the 
means of solving we cannot tell that those other 
circumstances may not have produced the whole of 
the effect independently or even in spite of the mer 
cury the method of difference in the ordinary 
mode of its use namely by comparing the state of 
things following the experiment with the state which 
preceded it is thus in the case of intermixture of 
effects entirely unavailing because other causes than 
that whose effect we are seeking to determine have 
been operating during the transition as for the 
other mode of employing the method of difference

intermixture of effects 

namely by comparing not the same case at two 
different periods but different cases this in the pre 
sent instance is quite chimerical in phenomena so 
complicated it is questionable if two cases similar in 
all respects but one ever occurred and were they to 
occur we could not possibly know that they were so 
exactly similar 

anything like a scientific use of the method of 
experiment in these complicated cases is therefore 
out of the question we can in the most favourable 
cases only discover by a succession of trials that a 
certain cause is very often followed by a certain effect 
for in one of these conjunct effects the portion 
which iq determined by any one of the influencing 
agents is generally as we before remarked but small 
and it must be a more potent cause than most if even 
the tendency which it really exerts is not thwarted by 
other tendencies in nearly as many cases as it is 
fulfilled 

if so little can be done by the experimental 
method to determine the conditions of an effect of 
many combined causes in the case of medical science 
still less is this method applicable to a class of phe 
nomena more complicated than even those of phy 
siology the phenomena of poutics and history 
there plurality of causes exists in almost boundless 
excess and the effects are for the most part inex 
tricably interwoven with one another to add to the 
embarrassment most of the inquiries in political 
science relate to the production of effects of a most 
comprehensive description such as the public wealth 
public security public morality and the like results 
liable to be affected directly or indirectly either in plus 
or in minus by nearly every fact which exists or 
event which occurs in human society the vulgar

notion that the safe methods on political subjects are 
those of baconian induction that the true guide is 
not general reasoning but specific experience will 
one day be quoted as among the most unequivocal 
marks of a low state of the speculative faculties in 
any age in which it is accredited what can be more 
ludicrous than the sort of parodies on experimental 
reasoning which one is accustomed to meet with 
not in popular discussion only but in grave treatises 
when the affairs of nations are the theme how 
it is asked can an institution be bad when the 
country has prospered under it how can such 
or such causes have contributed to the prosperity of 
one country when another has prospered without 
them whoever makes use of an argument of this 
kind not intending to deceive should be sent back 
to learn the elements of some one of the more easy 
physical sciences such reasoners ignore the fact of 
plurality of causes in the very case which affords the 
most signal example of it so little could be concluded 
in such a case from an possible collation of indi 
vidual instances that even the impossibility in 
social phenomena of making artificial experiments a 
circumstance otherwise so prejudicial to directly in 
ductive inquiry hardly affords in this case additional 
reason of regret for even if we could try experi 
ments upon a nation or upon the human race with 
as little scruple as m majendie tries them upon dogs 
or rabbits we should never succeed in making two 
instances identical in ever respect except the pre 
sence or absence of some one definite circumstance

particular law but where there are so many in 
fluences at work it requires some time for the 
influence of any new cause upon national phenomena 
to become apparent and as the causes operating in 
so extensive a sphere are not only infinitely numerous 
but in a state of perpetual alteration it is always 
certain that before the effect of the new cause becomes 
conspicuous enough to be a subject of induction so 
many of the other influencing circumstances will have 
changed as to vitiate the experiment

the study of phenomena resulting from the compo

the case ineflicient and illusory there remains only

chapter xl 
of the deductive method 

§ the mode of investigation which from the 
proved inapplicability of direct methods of observation 
and experiment remains to us as the main source of 
the knowledge we possess or can acquire respecting 
the conditions and laws of recurrence of the more 
complex phenomena is called in its most general 
expression the deductive method and consists of 
three operations the first one of direct induction 
the second of ratiocination and the third of 
verification 

i call the first step in the process an inductive 
operation because there must be a direct induction 
as the basis of the whole although in many particular 
investigations the place of the induction may be 
supplied by a prior deduction but the premisses of 
this prior deduction must have been derived from 
induction 

the problem of the deductive method is to find 
the law of an effect from the laws of the different 
tendencies of which it is the joint result the first 
requisite therefore is to know the laws of those ten 
dencies the law of each of the concurrent causes and 
this supposes a previous process of observation or 
experiment upon each cause separately or else a 
previous deduction which also must depend for its 
ultimate premisses upon observation or experiment 
thus if the subject be social or historical phenomena 
the premisses of the deductive method must be the

the deductive method 

laws of the causes which determine that class of phe 
nomena and those causes are human actions toge 
ther with the general outward circumstances imder 
the dominion of which mankind are placed and which 
constitute mans position in this world the deduc 
tive method applied to social phenomena must 
begin therefore by investigating or must suppose 
to have been already investigated the laws of human 
action and those properties of outward things by 
which the actions of human beings in society are 
determined some of these general truths will natu 
rally be obtained by observation and experiment 
others by deduction the more complex laws of 
human action for example may be deduced from the 
simpler ones but the simple or elementary laws will 
always and necessarily have been obtained by a 
directly inductive process 

to ascertain then the laws of each separate 
cause which takes a share in producing the effect is 
the first desideratum of the deductive method to 
know what the causes are which must be subjected to 
this process of study may or may not be diflcult 
in the case last mentioned this first condition is 
of easy fulfilment that social phenomena depended 
upon the acts and mental impressions of human 
beings never could have been a matter of any doubt 
however imperfectly it may have been known either 
by what laws those impressions and actions are 
governed or to what social consequences their laws 
naturally lead neither again after physical science 
had attained a certain development could there be 
any real doubt where to look for the laws on which 
the phenomena of ufe depend since they must be the 
mechanical and chemical laws of the solid and fluid 
substances composing the organised body and the

medium in which it subsists together with the 
peculiar vital laws of the different tissues constituting 
the organic structure in other cases really far more 
simple than these it was much less obvious in what 
quarter the causes were to be looked for as in the 
great case of the celestial phenomena until by 
combining the laws of certain causes it was found 
that those laws explained all the facts which expe 
rience had proved concerning the heavenly motions 
and led to predictions which it always verified man 
kind never knew that those were the causes but 
whether we are able to put the question before or 
not until after we have become capable of answering 
it in either case it must be answered the laws of 
the diflferent causes must be ascertained before we 
can proceed to deduce from them the conditions of 
the effect 

the mode of ascertaining these laws neither is 
nor can be any other than the fourfold method of 
experimental inquiry already discussed a few 
remarks on the application of that method to cases 
of the composition of causes are all that is requisite 

it is obvious that we cannot expect to find the 
law of a tendency by an induction from cases in 
which the tendency is counteracted the laws of 
motion could never have been brought to light from 
the observation of bodies kept at rest by the equi 
librium of opposing forces even where the tendency 
is not in the ordinary sense of the word counteracted 
but only modified by having its effects compounded 
with the effects arising from some other tendency or 
tendencies we are still in an unfavourable position for 
tracing by means of such cases the law of the ten 
dency itself it would have been diflscult to discover 
the law that every body in motion tends to continue

moving in a straight line by an induction from 
instances in which the motion is deflected into a 
curve by being compounded with the effect of an 
accelerating force notwithstanding the resources 
afforded in this description of cases by the method of 
concomitant variations the principles of a judicious 
experimentation prescribe that the law of each of the 
tendencies should be studied if possible in cases in 
which that tendency operates alone or in combina 
tion with no agencies but those of which the effect 
can from previous knowledge be calculated and 
allowed for 

accordingly in the cases unhappily very nume 
rous and important in which the causes do not suffer 
themselves to be separated and observed apart there 
is much dileculty in laying down with due certainty 
the inductive foundation necessary to support the 
deductive method this difficulty is most conspi 
cuous in the case of physiological phenomena it 
being impossible to separate the different agencies 
which collectively compose an organised body with 
out destroying the very phenomena which it is our 
object to investigate 

following life in creatures we disdect 

we lose it in the moment we detect 

and for this reason i am not quite prepared to agree 
with m comte in deeming the science of society 
and government intrinsically a more difficult study 
than the science of organic and animal life i cannot 
but incline to the opinion that physiology is embar 
rassed by greater natural difficulties and is probably 
susceptible of a less degree of ultimate perfection than 
the social science inasmuch as it is possible to study 
the laws of one mans mind and actions apart from 
other men much less imperfectly than we can study

the laws of one organ or tissue of the human body 
apart from the other organs or tissues 

it is profoundly remarked by m comte that 
pathological facts or to speak in common language 
diseases in their different forms and degrees afford in 
the case of physiological investigation the nearest 
equivalent to experimentation properly so called 
inasmuch as they often exhibit to us a definite disturb 
ance in some one organ or organic function the 
remaining organs and functions being in the first 
instance at • least unaffected it is true that from 
the perpetual actious and reactions which are going 
on among all the parts of the organic economy there 
can be no prolonged disturbance in any one function 
without ultimately invoking many of the others and 
when once it has done so the experiment for the 
most part loses its scientific value all depends upon 
observing the early stages of the derangement which 
unfortunately are of necessity the least marked if 
however the organs and functions not disturbed in 
the first instance become affected in a fixed order of 
succession some light is thereby thrown upon the 
action which one organ exercises over another and 
we occasionally obtain a series of effects which we 
can refer with some confidence to the original local 
derangement but for this it is necessary that we 
should know that the original derangement was local 
if it was what is termed constitutional that is if 
we do not know in what part of the animal economy 
it took its rise or the precise nature of the disturb 
ance which took place in that part we are unable to 
determine which of the various derangements was 
cause and which effect which of them were produced 
by one another and which by the direct though 
perhaps tardy action of the original cause

besides natural pathological facts we can pro 
duce pathological facts artificially we can try experi 
ments even in the popular sense of the term by 
subjecting the living being to some external agent 
such as the mercury of our former example as this 
experimentation is not intended to obtain a direct 
solution of any practical question but to discover 
general laws from which afterwards the conditions of 
any particular effect may be obtained by deduction 
the best cases to select are those of which the circum 
stances can be best ascertained and such are generally 
not those in which there is any practical object in 
view the experiments are best tried not in a state 
of disease which is essentially a changeable state but 
in the condition of health comparatively a fixed state 
in the one unusual agencies are at work the results 
of which wc have no means of predicting in the 
other the course of the accustomed physiological 
phenomena would it may generally be presumed 
remain undisturbed were it not for the disturbing 
cause which we introduce 

such with the occasional aid of the method of con 
comitant variations the latter not less encumbered 
than the more elementary methods by the peculiar 
difficulties of the subject are our inductive resources 
for ascertaining the laws of the causes considered 
separately when we have it not in our power to make 
trial of them in a state of actual separation the 
insufficiency of these resources is so glaring that no 
one can be surprised at the backward state of the 
science of physiology in which indeed our knowledge 
of causes is so imperfect that we can neither explain 
nor could without specific experience have predicted 
many of the facts which are certified to us by the 
most ordinary observation fortunately we are

much better informed as to the empirical laws of the 
phenomena that is the uniformities respecting which 
we cannot yet decide whether they are cases of 
causation or mere results of it not only has the 
order in which the facts of organization and life 
successively manifest themselves from the first germ 
of existence to death been found to be uniform and 
very accurately ascertainable but moreover by a 
great application of the method of concomitant 
variations to the entire facts of comparative anatomy 
and physiology the conditions of organic structure 
corresponding to each class of functions have been 
determined with considerable precision whether 
these organic conditions are the whole of the condi 
tions and whether they be conditions at all or mere 
collateral effects of some common cause we are quite 
ignorant nor are we ever likely to know unless we 
could construct an organized body and try whether it 
would live 

under such disadvantages do we in cases of this 
description attempt the initial or inductive step in 
the application of the deductive method to complex 
phenomena but such fortunately is not the 
common case in general the laws of the causes on 
which the effect depends may be obtained by an 
induction from comparatively simple instances or at 
the worst by deduction from the laws of simpler 
causes so obtained by simple instances are meant 
of course those in which the action of each cause was 
not intermixed or interfered with or not to any great 
extent by other causes whose laws were unknown

terized in the third volume of m comtes truly eneycloptdical

and only when the induction which furnished the 
premisses to the deductive method rested upon such 
instances has the application of such a method to the 
ascertainment of the laws of a complex effect been 
attended with brilliant results 

§ when the laws of the causes have been 
ascertained and the first stage of the great logical 
operation now under discussion satisfactorily accom 
plished the second part follows that of determining 
from the laws of the causes what effect any given 
combination of those causes will produce this is a 
process of calculation in the wider sense of the term 
and very often involves processes of calculation in 
the narrowest sense it is a ratiocination and when 
our knowledge of the causes is so perfect as to ex 
tend to the exact numerical laws which they observe 
in producing their effects the ratiocination may 
reckon among its premisses the theorems of the 
science of number in the whole immense extent of 
that science not only are the highest truths of 
mathematics often required to enable us to compute 
an effect the numerical law of which we already 
know but even by the aid of those highest truths we 
can go but a little way in so simple a case as the 
celebrated problem of three bodies gravitating towards 
one another with a force directly as their mass and 
inversely as the square of the distance all the re 
sources of the calculus have not hitherto suflsced to 
obtain anything more than an approximate general 
solution in a case a little more complex but still 
one of the simplest which arise in practice that of the 
motion of a projectile the causes which affect the 
velocity and range for example of a cannonball may 
be all known and estimated the force of the gun

powder the angle of elevation the density of the air 
the strength and direction of the sound hut it is one 
of the most diflscult of all mathematical problems to 
combine all these so as to determine the effect 
resulting from their collective action 

besides the theorems of number those of geo 
metry also come in as premisses where the effects 
take place in space and involve motion and extension 
as in mechanics optics acoustics astronomy but 
when the complication increases and the effects are 
under the influence of so many and such shifting 
causes as to give no room either for fixed numbers or 
for straight lines and regular curves as in the case of 
physiological to say nothing of mental and social 
phenomena the laws of number and extension are 
applicable if at all only on that large scale on 
which precision of details becomes unimportant and 
although these laws play a conspicuous part in the 
most striking examples of the investigation of nature 
by the deductive method as for example in the 
newtonian theory of the celestial motions they are 
by no means an indispensable part of every such pro 
cess all that is essential in it is the ratiocination 
from a general law to a particular case that is the 
determination by means of the particular circum 
stances of that case what result is required in that 
instance to fulfil the law thus in the torricellian 
experiment if the fact that air had weight had been 
previously known it would have been easy without 
any numerical data to deduce from the general law 
of equilibrium that the mercury would stand in the 
tube at such a height that the column of mercury 
would exactly balance a column of the atmosphere of 
equal diameter because otherwise equilibrium would 
not exist

by such raticionations from the separate laws of 
the causes we may to a certain extent succeed in 
answering either of the following questions given a 
certain combination of causes what effect will follow 
and what combination of causes if it existed would 
produce a given effect in the one case we deter 
mine the effect to be expected in any complex circum 
stances of which the different elements are known 
in the other case we learn according to what law — 
under what antecedent conditions — a given complex 
effect will recur 

§ but it may here be asked are not the same 
arguments by which the methods of direct observation 
and experiment were set aside as illusory when 
applied to the laws of complex phenomena appli 
cable with equal force against the method of de 
duction when in every single instance a multitude 
often an unknown multitude of agencies are clashing 
and combining what security have we that in our 
computation a priori we have taken all these into 
our reckoning how many must we not generally be 
ignorant of among those which we know how 
probable that some have been overlooked and even 
were all included how vain the pretence of summing 
up the effects of many causes unless we know accu 
rately the numerical law of each — a condition in most 
cases not to be fulfilled and even when fulfilled to 
make the calculation transcends in any but very 
simple cases the utmost power of mathematical science 
with its most modem improvements 

these objections truly have much weight and 
would be altogether unanswerable if there were no 
test by which when we employ the deductive 
method we might judge whether an error of any of

the above descriptions had been committed or no 
such a test however there is and its application 
forms under the name of verification the third essen 
tial component part of thedeductive method without 
which all the results it can give have little other 
value than that of guesswork to warrant reliance 
upon the general conclusions arrived at by deduction 
these conclusions must be found on a careful com 
parison to accord with the results of direct observa 
tion wherever it can be had if when we have 
experience to compare with them this experience 
confirms them we may safely trust to them in other 
cases of which our specific experience is yet to come 
but if our deductions have led to the conclusion that 
from a particular combination of causes a given effect 
would result then in all known cases where that com 
bination can be shown to have existed and where the 
effect has not followed we must be able to show or 
at least to make a probable surmise what frustrated 
it if we cannot the theory is imperfect and not yet 
to be relied upon nor is the verification complete 
unless some of the cases in which the theory is borne 
out by the observed result are of at least equal com 
plexity with any other cases in which its application 
could be called for 

it needs scarcely be observed that if direct observa 
tion and collation of instances have furnished us with 
any empirical laws of the effect whether true in all 
observed cases or only true for the most part the 
most effectual verification of which the theory could 
be susceptible would be that it led deductively to 
those empirical laws that the uniformities whether 
complete or incomplete which were observed to exist 
among the phenomena were accounted for by the laws 
of the causes were such as could not but exist if those

be really the causes by which the phenomena are pro 
duced thus it was very reasonably deemed an essen 
tial requisite of any true theory of the causes of the 
celestial motions that it should lead by deduction 
to keplers laws which accordingly the newtonian 
theory did 

in order therefore to facilitate the verification of 
theories obtained by deduction it is important that as 
many as possible of the empirical laws of the pheno 
mena should be ascertained by a comparison of 
instances conformably to the method of agreement 
as well as it must be added that the phenomena 
themselves should be described in the most compre 
hensive as well as accurate manner possible by 
collecting from the observation of parts the simplest 
possible correct expression for the corresponding 
wholes as when the series of the observed places of a 
planet was first expressed by a system of epicycles and 
subsequently by an ellipse 

it is worth remarking that complex instances 
which would have been of no use for the discovery of 
the simple laws into which we ultimately analyze 
their phenomena nevertheless when they have served 
to verify the analysis become additional evidence of 
the laws themselves although we could not have 
got at the law from complex cases still when the law 
got at otherwise is found to be in accordance with 
the result of a complex case that case becomes a new 
experiment on the law and helps to confirm what it 
did not assist us to discover it is a new trial of the 
principle in a different set of circumstances and occa 
sionally serves to eliminate some circumstance not pre 
viously excluded and to effect the exclusion of which 
might require an experiment impossible to be executed 
this was strikingly conspicuous in the example for

merly quoted in which the difference between the 
observed and the calculated velocity of sound was 
ascertained to result from the heat extricated by the 
condensation which takes place in each sonorous 
vibration this was a trial in new circumstances of 
the law of the developement of heat by compression 
and it certainly added materially to the proof of the uni 
versality of that law accordingly any law of nature 
is deemed to have gained in point of certainty by 
being found to explain some complex case which had 
not previously been thought of in connexion with it 
and this indeed is a consideration to which it is the 
habit of scientific men to attach rather too much value 
than too little 

to the deductive method thus characterised in 
its three constituent parts induction ratiocination 
and verification the human mind is indebted for its 
most glorious triumphs in the investigation of nature 
to it we owe all the theories by which vast and com 
plicated phenomena are embraced under a few simple 
laws which considered as the laws of those great 
phenomena could never have been detected by their 
direct study we may form some conception of what 
the method has done for us from the case of the celes 
tial motions one of the simplest among the greater 
instances of the composition of causes since except 
in a few cases not of primary importance each of the 
heavenly bodies may be considered without material 
inaccuracy to be never at one time influenced by the 
attraction of more than two bodies the sun and one 
other planet or satellite making with the reaction of 
the body itself and the tangential force only four

motions of that body depend a much smaller number

bow could we ever have ascertained the combination

standing the regularity which manifests itself in those

that all the combinations of causes which occur at all

the causes were if the existence of agencies precisely 
similar on our own earth had not fortunately brought 
the causes themselves within the reach of experimenta 
tion under simple circumstances as we shall have 
occasion to analyze further on this great example of 
the method of deduction we shall not occupy any 
time with it here but shall proceed to that secondary 
application of the deductive method the result of

chapter xii 
op the explanation op laws of nature 

 the deductive operation by which we derive 
the law of an effect from the laws of the causes of 
which the concurrence gives rise to it may be under 
taken either for the purpose of discovering the law or 
of explaining a law already discovered the word 
explanation occurs so continually and holds so im 
portant a place in philosophy that a little time 
spent in fixing the meaning of it will be profitably 
employed 

an individual fact is said to be explained by 
pointing out its cause that is by stating the law or 
laws of causation of which its production is an 
instance thus a conflagration is explained when it 
is proved to have arisen from a spark falling into the 
midst of a heap of combustibles and in a similar 
manner a law or uniformity in nature is said to be 
explained when another law or laws are pointed out 
of which that law itself is but a case and from which 
it could be deduced 

§ there are three distinguishable sets of cir 
cumstances in which a law of causation may be 
explained from or as it also is often expressed 
resolved into other laws 

the first is the case already so fully considered 
an intermixture of laws producing a joint effect equal 
to the sum of the effects of the causes taken separately 
the law of the complex effect is explained by being 
resolved into the separate laws of the causes which

explanation of laws 

contribute to it thus the law of the motion of a 
planet is resolved into the law of the tangential force 
which tends to produce an uniform motion in the 
tangent and the law of the centripetal force which 
tends to produce an accelerating motion towards 
the sun the real motion being a compound of the 
two 

it is necessary here to remark that in this resolu 
tion of the law of a complex effect the laws of which 
it is compounded are not the only elements it is 
resolved into the laws of the separate causes together 
with the fact of their coexistence the one is as 
essential an ingredient as the other whether the 
object be to discover the law of the effect or only to 
explain it to deduce the laws of the heavenly 
motions we require not only to know the law of a 
rectilineal and that of a gravitative force but the 
existence of both these forces in the celestial regions 
arid even their relative amount the complex laws 
of causation are thus resolved into two distinct kinds 
of elements the one simpler laws of causation the 
other in the aptly selected language of dr chalmers 
collocations the collocations consisting in the exist 
ence of certain agents or powers in certain circum 
stances of place and time we shall hereafter have 
occasion to return to this distinction and to dwell 
upon it at such a length as dispenses with the neces 
sity of further insisting upon it here the first mode 
then of the explanation of laws of causation is when 
the law of an effect is resolved into the various ten 
dencies of which it is the result and into the laws of 
those tendencies 

 a second case is when between what seemed 
the cause and what was supposed to be its effect

 induction 

further observation detects an intermediate link a 
fact caused by the antecedent and in its turn causing 
the consequent so that the cause at first assigned is 
but the remote cause operating through the inter 
mediate phenomenon a seemed the cause of c but 
it subsequently appeared that a was only the cause 
of b and that it is b which was the cause of c for 
example mankind were aware that the act of touch 
ing an outward object caused a sensation it was 
however at last discovered that after we have touched 
the object and before we experience the sensation 
some change takes place in a kind of thread called a 
nerve which extends from our outward organs to the 
brain touching the object therefore is only the 
remote cause of our sensation that is not the cause 
properly speaking but the cause of the cause — the 
real cause of the sensation is the change in the state 
of the nerve future experience may not only give 
us more knowledge than we now have of the particular 
nature of this change but may also interpolate another 
link between the contact for example of the object 
with our outward organs and the production of the 
change of state in the nerve there may take place some 
electric phenomenon hitherto however no such 
intermediate agency has been discovered and the 
touch of the object must be considered provisionally 
at least as the proximate cause of the afiection of 
the nerve the sequence therefore of a sensation of 
touch upon contact with an object is ascertained not 
to be an ultimate law is resolved as the phrase is 
into two other laws — the law that contact with an 
object produces an afiection of the nerve and the 
law that an afiection of the nerve produces sensa 
tion

the chemical elements of the organic structure from 
the rest and their entering into combination with the 
acid the acid causes this separation of the elements 
and the separation of the elements causes the disorga 
nization and often the charring of the structure so 
again chlorine extracts colouring matters whence its 
efficacy in bleaching and piuifies the air from infec 
tion this law is resolved into the two following 
laws chlorine has a powerful affinity for bases of all 
kinds particularly metallic bases and hydrogen 
such bases are essential elements of colouring mat 
ters and contagious compounds which substances 
therefore are decomposed and destroyed by chlo 
rine 

 it is of importance to remark that when a 
sequence of phenomena is thus resolved into other 
laws they are always laws more general than itself 
the law that a is followed by c is less general than 
either of the laws which connect b with c and a 
with b this will appear fixim very simple con 
siderations 

all laws of causation are liable to be counteracted 
or frustrated by the nonfulfilment of some negative 
condition the tendency therefore of b to produce 
c may be defeated now the law that a produces b 
is equally fulfilled whether b is followed by c or not 
but the law that a produces c by means of b is of 
course only fulfilled when b is really followed by c 
and is therefore less general than the law that a 
produces b it is also less general than the law that

b produces c for b may have other causes besides 
a and as a produces c only by means of b while 
b produces c whether it has itself been produced by 
a or by anything else the second law embraces a 
greater number of instances covers as it were a 
greater space of ground than the first 

thus in our former example the law that the 
contact of an object causes a change in the state of 
the nerve is more general than the law that contact 
with an object causes sensation since for aught we 
know the change in the nerve may equally take place 
when from a counteracting cause as for instance 
strong mental excitement the sensation does not 
follow as in a battle where wounds are often re 
ceived without any consciousness of receiving them 
and again the law that change in the state of a nerve 
produces sensation is more general than the law that 
contact with an object produces sensation since the 
sensation equally follows the change in the nerve when 
not produced by contact with an object but by some 
other cause as in the wellknown case when a 
person who has lost a limb feels the very sensation 
which he has been accustomed to call a pain in the 
limb 

not only are the laws of more immediate sequence 
into which the law of a remote sequence is resolved 
laws of greater generality than that law is but as a 
consequence of or rather as imphed in their greater 
generality they are more to be rehed on there are 
fewer chances of their being ultimately found not to 
be universally true from the moment when the 
sequence of a and c is shown not to be immediate 
but to depend upon an intervening phenomenon 
then however constant and invariable the sequence of 
a and c has hitherto been found possibilities arise

of its failure exceeding those which can affect either 
of the more immediate sequences a b and b c the 
tendency of a to produce c may be defeated by what 
ever is capable of defeating either the tendency of a 
to produce b or the tendency of b to produce c it 
is therefore twice as liable to failure as either of those 
more elementary tendencies and the generalization 
that a is always followed by c is twice as likely to 
be found erroneous and so of the converse gene 
ralisation that c is always preceded and caused by 
a which will be erroneous not only if there should 
happen to be a second immediate mode of production 
of c itself but moreover if there be a second mode of 
production of b the immediate antecedent of c in the 
sequence 

the resolution of the one generalisation into the 
other two not only shows that there are possible 
limitations of the former from which its two elements 
are exempt but shows also where these are to be looked 
for as soon as we know that b intervenes between 
a and c we also know that if there be cases in which 
the sequence of a and c does not hold these are 
most likely to be found by studying the effects and 
the conditions of the phenomenon b 

it appears then that in the second of the three 
modes in which a law may be resolved into other 
laws the latter are more general that is extend to 
more cases and are also less likely to require limi 
tation from subsequent experience thap the law which 
they serve to explain they are more nearly uncon 
ditional they are defeated by fewer contingencies 
they are a nearer approach to the universal truth of 
nature the same observations are still more evi 
dently true with regard to the first of the three modes 
of resolution when the law of an effect of com

 induction 

bined causes is resolved into the separate laws of the 
causes the nature of the case unplies that the law of 
the effect is less general than the law of any of the 
causes since it only holds when they are combined 
while the law of any one of the causes holds good 
both then and also when that cause acts apart from 
the rest it is also manifest that the complex law is 
liable to be oftener unfulfilled than any one of the 
simpler laws ef which it is the result since every con 
tingency which defeats any of the laws prevents so 
much of the effect as depends upon it and thereby 
defeats the complex law the mere rusting for 
example of some small part of a great machine often 
suffices entirely to prevent the effect which ought to 
result from the joint action of all the parts the 
law of the effect of a combination of causes is always 
subject to the whole of the negative conditions which 
attach to the action of all the causes severally 

there is another and a still stronger reason why 
the laf of a complex effect must be less general than 
the laws of the causes which conspire to produce it 
the same causes acting according to the same laws 
and differing only in the proportions in which they 
are combined often produce effects which differ not 
merely in quantity but in kind the combination of 
a tangential with a centripetal force in the proportions 
which obtain in all the planets and satellites of our 
solar system gives rise to an elliptical motion but if 
the ratio of thq two forces to each other were slightly 
altered it is demonstrable that the motion produced 
would be in a circle or a parabola or an hyperbola 
and it has been supposed that in the case of some 
comets one of these is really the fact yet the law of 
the parabolic motion would be resolvable into the 
very same simple laws into which that of the elliptical

explanation of laws 

motion is resolved namely the law of the permanence 
of rectilineal motion and the law of an imiform cen 
tripetal force if therefore in the course of ages 
some circumstance were to manifest itself which 
without defeating the law of either of those forces 
should merely alter their proportion to one another 
such as the shock of a comet or even the accumu 
lating effect of the resistance of the medium in which 
astronomers have been led to surmise that the motions 
of the heavenly bodies take place the elliptical 
motion might be changed into a motion in some other 
curve and the complex law of the heavenly motions 
as at present understood would be deprived of its 
universality although the discovery would not at all 
detract from the universality of the simpler laws into 
which that complex law is resolved the law in 
short of each of the concurrent causes remains the 
same however their collocations may vary but the 
law of their joint effect varies with every difference in 
the collocations there needs no more to show how 
much more general the elementary laws must be than 
any of the complex laws which are derived from them 

§ besides the two modes which have been 
treated of there is a third mode in which laws are 
resolved into one another and in this it is self 
evident that they are resolved into laws more general 
than themselves this third mode is the subsumption 
as it has been called of one law under another 
or what comes to the same thing the gathering up 
of several laws into one more general law which 
includes them all the most splendid example of this 
operation was when terrestrial gravity and the central 
force of the solar system were brought together

under the general law of gravitation it had been 
proved antecedently that the earth and the other 
planets tended to the sun and it had been known 
from the earliest times that all terrestrial bodies tend 
towards the earth these were similar phenomena 
and to enable them both to be subsumed under one 
law it was only necessary to prove that as the effects 
were similar in quauty so also they as to quantity 
conform to the same rules this was first shown to 
be true of the moon which agreed with terrestrial 
objects not only in tending to a centre but in the 
fact that this centre was the earth the tendency of 
the moon to the earth was already known to vary as 
the inverse square of the distance and it was deduced 
from this by direct calculation that if the moon were 
as near to the earth as terrestrial objects are and the 
tangential force were suspended the moon would fall 
towards the earth through exactly as many feet in a 
second as those objects do by virtue of their weight 
hence the inference was irresistible that the moon 
also tends to the earth by virtue of its weight and 
that the two phenomena the tendency of the moon 
to the earth and the tendency of terrestrial objects to 
the earth being not only similar in quality but 
when under the same circumstances identical in 
quantity are cases of one and the same law of causa 
tion but the tendency of the moon to the earth and 
the tendency of the earth and planets to the sun were 
already known to be cases of the same law of causa 
tion and thus the law of all these tendencies and 
the law of terrestrial gravity were recognised as iden 
tical or in other words were subsiuned under one 
general law that of gravitation

induction at laws which hold under such an immense 
variety of circumstances laws so general as to be 
independent of any varieties of space or time which 
we are able to observe requires for the most part 
many distinct sets of experiments or observations 
conducted at different times and by different people 
one part of the law is first ascertained afterwards 
another part one set of observations teaches us that 
the law holds good under some conditions another 
that it holds good under other conditions by com 
bining which observations we find that it holds 
good under conditions much more general or even 
universally the general law in this case is literally 
the sum of all the partial ones it is the recognition 
of the same sequence in different sets of instances 
and may in fact be regarded as merely one step in 
the process of elimination that tendency of bodies 
towards one another which we now call gravity had 
at first been observed only upon the earths surface 
where it manifested itself only as a tendency of all 
bodies towards the earth and might therefore be 
ascribed to a peculiar property of the earth itself one 
of the circumstances namely the proximity of the 
earth had not been eliminated to eliminate this 
circumstance required a fresh set of instances in other 
parts of the universe these we could not ourselves 
create and though nature had created them for us 
we were placed in very unfavourable circumstances 
for observing them to make these observations fell 
naturally to the lot of a different set of persons from

indeed been a matter of great interest at a time when 
the idea of explaining celestial facts by terrestrial 
laws was looked upon as the confounding of an 
indefeasible distinction when however the celes 
tial motions were accurately ascertained and the 
deductive processes performed from which it appeared 
that their laws and those of terrestrial gravity corre 
sponded those celestial observations became a set of 
instances which exactly eliminated the circumstance 
of proximity to the earth and proved that in the 
original case that of terrestrial objects it was not the 
earth as such that caused the motion or the pressure 
but the circumstance common to that case with the 
celestial instances namely the presence of some great 
body within certain limits of distance 

§ there are then three modes of explaining 
laws of causation or which is the same thing 
resolving them into other laws first when the law 
of an effect of comlnned causes is resolved into the 
separate laws of the causes together with the fsetct of 
their combination secondly when the law which 
connects any two links not proximate in a chain of 
causation is resolved into the laws which connect each 
with the intermediate links both of these are cases 
of resolving one law into two or more in the third 
two or more are resolved into one when after the 
law has been shown to hold good in several different 
classes of cases we decide that what is true in each 
of these classes of cases is true under some more 
general supposition consisting of what all those 
classes of cases have in common we may here 
remark that this last operation involves none of the 
uncertainties attendant upon induction by the method 
of agreement since we need not suppose the result

to be extended by way of inference to any new class 
of cases different from those by the comparison of 
which it was engendered 

in all these three processes laws are as we have 
seen resolved into laws more general than themselves 
laws extending to all the cases which the former 
extend to and others besides in the first two modes 
they are also resolved into laws more certain in other 
words more universally true than themselves they 
are in fact proved not to be themselves laws of 
nature the character of which is to be universally 
true but results of laws of nature which may be only 
true conditionally and for the most part no diflfer 
ence of this sort exists in the third case since here 
the partial laws are in fact the very same law as 
the general one and any exception to them would be 
an exception to it too 

by all the three processes the range of deductive 
science is extended since the laws thus resolved 
may be thenceforth deduced demonstratively from 
the laws into which they are resolved as already 
remarked the same deductive process which proves a 
law or fact of causation if unknown serves to explain 
it when known 

the word explanation is here used in a somewhat 
peculiar sense what is called explaining one law of 
nature by another is but substituting one mystery for 
another and does nothing to render the general 
course of nature other than mysterious we can no 
more assign a why for the more extensive laws than 
for the partial ones the explanation may substitute 
a mystery which has become familiar and has grown 
to seem not mysterious for one which is still strange 
and this is the meaning of explanation in common

parlance but the process with which we are here 
concerned often does the very contrary it resolves a 
phenomenon with which we are familiar into one of 
which we previously knew little or nothing as when 
the common fact of the fall of heavy bodies is 
resolved into a tendency of all particles of matter 
towards one another it must be kept constantly in 
view therefore that when philosophers speak of 
explaining any of the phenomena of nature they 
always mean pointing out not some more familiar 
but merely some more general phenomenon of which 
it is a partial exemplification or some laws of causa 
tion which produce it by their joint or successive 
action and from which therefore its conditions may 
be determined deductively every such operation 
brings us a step nearer towards answering the ques 
tion which was stated some time ago as compre 
hending the whole problem of the investigation of 
nature viz what are the fewest assumptions which 
being granted the order of nature as it exists would 
be the result what are the fewest general proposi 
tions from which all the uniformities existing in 
nature could be deduced 

the laws thus explained or resolved are some 
times said to be accounted for but the expression is 
incorrect if taken to mean anything more than what 
has been already stated in minds not habituated to 
accurate thinking there is often a confused notion 
that the general laws are the causes of the partial 
ones that the law of general gravitation for example 
causes the phenomenon of the fall of bodies to the 
earth but to assert this would be a misuse of the 
word cause terrestrial gravity is not an eflfect of 
general gravitation but a case of it that is one kind

miscellaneous examples op the explanation 
of laws of nature 

 l some of the most remarkable instances which 
have occurred since the great newtonian generaliza 
tion of the explanation of laws of causation subsist 
ing among complex phenomena by resolving them 
into simpler and more general laws are to be found 
among the recent speculations of liebig in organic 
chemistry these speculations although they have 
not yet been sitfficiently long before the world to 
entitle us positively to assume that no wellgrounded 
objection can be made to any part of them afford 
however so admirable an example of the spirit of the 
deductive method that i may be permitted to present 
some specimens of them here 

it had been observed in certain cases that chemical 
action is as it were contagious that is to say a 
substance which would not of itself yield to a parti 
cular chemical attraction the force of the attraction 
not being sufficient to overcome cohesion or to 
destroy some chemical combination in which the 
substance was already held will nevertheless do so 
if placed in contact with some other body which is in 
the act of yielding to the same force nitric acid for 
example does not dissolve pure platinum which may 
 be boiled with this acid without being oxidized by 
it even when in a state of such fine division that it 
no longer reflects ught but the same acid easily 
dissolves silver now if an alloy of silver and plati

num be treated with nitric acid the add does not as 
might naturally be expected separate the two metals 
dissolving the silver and leaving the platinum it 
dissolves both the platinum as well as the silver 
becomes oxidized and in that state combines with the 
undecomposed portion of the acid in like manner 
 copper does not decompose water even when boiled 
in dilute sulphuric add but an alloy of copper zinc 
and nickel dissolves easily in this acid with evolution 
of hydrogen gas these phenomena cannot be 
explained by the laws of what is termed chemical 
affinity they point to a peculiar law by which the 
oxidatioa which one body suffers causes another in 
contact with it to submit to the same diange and 
not only chemical composition but chemical decom 
position is capable of being similarly propagated the 
peroxide of hydrogen a compound formed by hydrogen 
with a greater amount of oxygen than the quantity 
necessary to form water is held together by a chemical 
attraction of so weak a nature that the lightest eir 
cumstance is sufficient to decompose it and it even 
though very slowly gives off oxygen and is reduced 
to water spontaneously being i presume decom 
posed by the tendency of its oxygen to absorb heat 
and assume the gaseous state now it has been 
observed that if this decomposition of the peroxidiei 
of hydrogen takes place in contact with some metallic 
oxides as those of silver and the peroxides of lead 
dud manganese it superinduces a corresponding che 
mical action upon those substances they also give 
forth the whole or a portion of their oxygen and are 
reduced to the metal or to the protoxide although they 
do not undergo this change sponticneously and there 
is no chemical affinity at work to make them do so 
other similar phenomena are mentioned by dr liebig

 induction 

 now no other expiration he observes of these 
phenomena can be given than that a body in the act 
of combination or decomposition enables another body 
with which it is in contact to enter into the same 
state 

here therefore is a law of nature of great sim 
phcity but which owing to the extremely special and 
umited character of the phenomena in which alone 
it can be detected experimentally because in them 
alone its results are not intermixed and blended with 
those of other laws had been very uttle recognised 
by chemists and no one could have ventured on expe 
rimental evidence to affirm it as a law common to all 
chemical action owing to the impossibility of a rigo 
rous employment of the method of difference where 
the properties of difierent kinds of substance are 
involved an impossibility which we noticed and cha 
racterised in a previous chapter now this extremely 
special and apparently precarious generalization has 
in the hands of liebig been converted by a masterly 
employment of the deductive method into a law 
pervading all nature in the same way as gravitation 
assumed that character in the hands of newton and 
has been found to explain in the most unexpected 
manner numerous detached generalizations of a more 
hmited kind reducing the phenomena concerned in 
those generalizations into mere cases of itself 

the contagious influence of chemical action is not a 
powerful force and is only capable of overcoming weak 
affinities we may therefore expect to find it prin 
cipally exemplified in the decomposition of substances 
which are held together by weak chemical forces

chemical action upon the whole lump the con

is a substance which from the complexity of its com 
position has no great energy of coherence in its exist

combination with the elements of water into carbonic 
acid and alcolol now the mere presence of yeast 
the mere proximity of a substance of which the ele 
ments are separating from each other and com 
bining with the elements of water causes sugar to 
undergo the same change giving out carbonic acid 
gas and becoming alcohol it is not the elements 
contained in the yeast which do this an aqueoua 
infusion of yeast may be mixed with a solution of 
sugar and preserved in vessels from which the air is 
excluded without either experiencing the slightest 
change neither does the insoluble residue of the 
yeast after being treated with water possess the 
power of exciting fermentation it is not the yeast

subsumption of special laws under a more general

sive expression which includes them all for the 
curious fact of the contagious nature of chemical 
action was only raised into a law of all chemical action 
by these very investigations just as the newtonian 
attraction was only recognised as a law of all matter 
when it was found to explain the phenomena of terres 
trial gravity previously to liebigs investigations 
the property in question had only been observed in a 
few special cases of chemical action but when his 
deductive reasonings had established that innumerable 
efiects produced upon weak compounds by substances 
none of whose known peculiarities would account for 
their having such a power might be explained by con 
sidering the supposed special property to exist in all 
those cases these numerous generalizations on sepa 
rate substances were brought together into one law of 
chemical action in general the peculiarities of the 
various substances being in fact eliminated just as 
the newtonian deduction eliminated from the in 
stances of terrestrial gravity the circumstance of 
proximity to the earth

should ultimately be foimd to agree with all the facts

special laws which liebig has attempted to explaih 
from and resolve into more general ones sure that 
the blood in passing through the lungs absorbs oxy 
gen and gives out carbonic acid gas changing thereby 
its colour from a blackish purple to a brilliant red 
the absorption and exhalation are evidently chemical 
phenomena and the carbon of the carbonic acid must 
have been derived from the body that is must have 
been absorbed by the blood from the substances with 
which it came into contact in its passage through the 
organism required to find the intermediate links

take place first the absorption of the carbon or of 
the carbonic acid by the blood in its circulation 
through the body next the excretion of the carbon 
or the exchange of the carbonic acid for oxygen in its 
passage through the lungs 

dr liebig believes himself to have found the 
solution of this vexata qtujsstio in a class of chemical 
actions in which scarcely any less acute and accurate 
inquirer would have thought of looking for it 

blood is composed of two parts the serum and 
the globules the serum absorbs and holds in solu 
tion carbonic acid in great quantity but has no 
tendency either to part with it or to absorb oxygen 
the globules therefore are concluded to be the por

these globules contain a certain quantity of iron 
which from chemical tests is inferred to be in the state

there are two oxides of iron a protoxide and a 
peroxide in the arterial blood the iron is in the 
form of peroxide in the venous blood we have no 
direct evidence which of the oxides is present but 
the considerations to be presently stated will prove 
that it is the protoxide as arterial and venous 
blood are in a perpetual state of alternate conver 
sion into one another the question arises under 
what circumstances the protoxide of iron is capable of 
being converted into the peroxide and vice versd 
now the protoxide readily combines with oxygen in 
the presence of water forming the hydrated peroxide 
these conditions it finds in passing through the lungs 
it derives oxygen from the air and finds water in the 
blood itself this would already explain one portion 
of the phenomena of respiration but the arterial 
blood in quitting the lungs is charged with hydrated 
peroxide in what manner is the peroxide brought 
back to its former state 

the chemical conditions for the reduction of the 
hydrated peroxide into the slate of protoxide are 
precisely those which the blood meets with in circu 
lating through the body namely contact with organic 
compounds 

hydrated peroxide of iron when treated with 
organic compounds where no sulphur is present gives 
forth oxygen and water which oxygen attracting the 
carbon from the organic substance becomes carbonic 
acid while the peroxide being reduced to the state 
of protoxide combines with the carbonic acid and 
becomes a carbonate now this carbonate needs only 
come again into contact with oxygen and water to be 
decomposed the carbonic acid being given off and 
the protoxide by the absorption of oxygen and water 
becoming again the hydmted peroxide

the mysterious chemical phenomena connected 
with respiration can now by a beautiful deductive 
process be completely explained the arterial blood 
containing iron in the form of hydrated peroxide 
passes into the capillaries where it meets with the 
decaying tissues receiving also in its course certain 
nonazotised but highly carbonised animal products 
in particular the bile in these it finds the precise 
conditions required for decomposing the peroxide into 
oxygen and the protoxide the oxygen combines 
with the carbon of the decaying tissues and forms 
carbonic acid which although insufficient in amount 
to neutralize the whole of the protoxide combines 
with a portion onefourth of it and returns in the 
form of a carbonate along with the other three 
fourths of the protoxide through the venous system 
into the lungs there it again meets with oxygen and 
water the free protoxide becomes hydrated peroxide 
the carbonate of protoxide parts with its carbonic acid 
and by absorbing oxygen and water enters also into 
the state of hydrated peroxide the heat evolved in 
the transition from protoxide to peroxide as well as 
in the previous oxidation of the carbon contained 
in the tissues is considered byliebig as the cause 
which sustains the temperature of the body but 
into this portion of the speculation we need not 
enter 



 as corroborating the opinion of liebig that the protoxide of 
iron in the venous blood is only partially carbonated the fact has 
been suggested that the system shows great readiness to absorb an 
extra quantity of carbonic acid as furnished in effervescing drinks 
in such cases the acid must combine with something and that 
something is probably the free protoxide it would be worth 
ascerttuning whether the protoxide itself or its carbonate has the

this example displays the second mode of resolving 
complex laws by the interpolation of intermediate 
links in the chain of causation and some of the steps 
of the deduction exhibit cases of the first mode that 
which infers the joint effect of two or more causes 
from their separate effects but to trace out in detail 
these exemplifications may be left to the intelligence 
of the reader the third mode is not employed in 
this example since the simpler laws into which those 
of respiration are resolved the laws of the chemical 
action of the oxides of iron were already known laws 
and did not acquire any additional generality from 
their employment in the present case 

 the property which salt possesses of pre 
serving animal substances from putrefaction is re 
solved by liebig into two more general laws the 
strong attraction of salt for water and the necessity 
of the presence of water as a condition of putrefaction 
the intermediate phenomenon which is interpolated 
between the remote cause and the effect can here be 
not merely inferred but seen for it is a familiar fact 
that flesh upon which salt has been thrown is speedily 
found swimming in brine 

the second of the two factors as they may be 
termed into which the preceding law has been 
resolved the necessity of water to putrefaction itself 
affords an additional example of the resolution of 
laws the law itself is proved by the method of 



peioxide in the lungs if the carbonate then the beneficial effect 
on the animal economy of drinks which giro an artificial supply of 
carbonic acid to the system would be to that extent deductively

difference since flesh completely dried and kept in a 
dry atmosphere does not putrefy as we see in the case 
of dried provisions and human bodies in very dry 
climates a deductive explanation of this same law 
results from liebigs speculations the putrefaction 
of animal and other azotised bodies is a chemical 
process by which they are gradually dissipated in a 
gaseous form chiefly in that of carbonic acid and 
ammonia now to convert the carbon of the animal 
substance into carbonic acid requires oxygen and to 
convert the azote into ammonia requires hydrcen 
which are the elements of water the extreme rapidity 
of the putrefaction of azotised substances compared 
with the gradual decay of nonazotised bodies such 
as wood and the like by the action of oxygen alone 
is explained by liebig from the general law that 
substances are much more easily decomposed by the 
action of two different affinities upon two of their 
elements than by the action of only one 

the purgative effect of salts with alkaline bases 
when administered in concentrated solutions is 
explained by liebig from the two following principles 
animal tissues such as the stomach do not absorb 
concentrated solutions of alkaline salts and such 
solutions do dissolve the solids contained in the intes 
tines the simpler laws into which the complex law 
is here resolved are the second of the two foregoing • 
principles combined with a third namely that the 
peristaltic contraction acts easily upon substances in a 
state of solution the negative general proposition 
that animal substances do not absorb these salts con 
tributes to the explanation by accoimting for the 
absence of a counteracting cause namely absorp 
tion by the stomach which in the case of other

§ from the foregoing and similar instances we 
may see the importance when a law of nature pre 
viously unknown has been brought to light or when 
uew light has been thrown upon a known law by 
experiment of examining all cases which present the 
conditions necessary for bringing that law into action 
a process necessarily fertile in demonstrations of spe 
cial laws previously unsuspected and explanations of 
others already empirically known 

for instance faraday discovered by experiment 
that voltaic electricity could be evolved from a natural 
magnet provided a coiiducting body were set in motion 
at right angles to the direction of the magnet and 
this he found to hold not only of small magnets but 
of that great magnet the earth the law being thus 
established experimentally that electricity is evolved 
by a magnet and a conductor moving at right angles 
to the direction of its poles we may now look out for 
fresh instances in which these conditions meet 
wherever a conductor moves or revolves at right 
angles to the direction of the earths magnetic poles 
there we may expect an evolution of electricity la 
the northern regions where the polar direction is 
nearly perpendicular to the horizon all horizontal 
motions of conductors will produce electricity hori 
zontal wheels for example made of metal likewise 
all running streams will evolve a current of electricity 
which will circulate round them and the air thus 
charged with electricity may be one of the causes of 
the aurora borealis in the equatorial regions on 
the contrary upright wheels placed parallel to the

equator will originate a voltaic circuit and watermk 
will naturally become electric 

for a second example it has recently been found 
chiefly by the researches of professor graham that 
gases have a strong tendency to permeate animal 
membranes and diffuse themselves through the 
spaces which such membranes inclose notwithstand 
ing the presence of other gases in those spaces 
proceeding from this general law and reviewing a 
variety of cases in which gases lie contiguous to 
memlnranes we are enabled to demonstrate or to ex 
plain the following more special laws st the human 
or animal body when surrounded with any gas not 
already contained within the body absorbs it rapidly 
such for instance as the gases of putrefying matters 
which helps to explain malaria dd hie carbonic 
acid gas of effervescing drinks evcved in the sto 
mach permeates its membranes and rapidly spreads 
through the system where as suggested in a former 
note it probably comlnnes with the iron contained in 
the blood srd alcohol taken ipto the stomach the 
temperature of the stomach is above the boilingpoint 
of pure alcohol passes into vapour and spreads 
through the system with great rapidity which com 
bined with the high combustibility of alcohol or in 
other words its ready combination with oxygen may 
perhaps help to explain the bodily warmth immediately 
consequent on drinking sjhrituous liquors th in any 
state of the body in which peculiar gases are formed 
within it these will rapidly exhale through all parts 
of the body and hence the rapidity with which in 
certain states of disease the surrounding atmosphere 
becomes tainted th the putrefaction of the inte 
rior parts of a carcase will proceed as rapidly as that 
of the exterior from the ready passage outwards of

the gaseous products the exchange of oxygen and 
carbonic acid in the lungs is not prevented but rather 
promoted by the intervention of the membrane of the 
lungs and the coats of the blood vessels between the 
blood and the air it is necessary however that 
there should be a substance in the blood with which 
the oxygen of the air may immediately combine 
otherwise instead of passing inte the blood it would 
permeate the whole organism and it is necessary 
that the carbonic acid as it is formed in the capil 
laries should also find a substance in the blood with 
which it can combine otherwise it would leave the 
body at all points instead of being discharged through 
the lungs 

§ the following is a deduction which confirms 
by explaining the old but not undisputed empirical 
generalization that soda powders weaken the human 
system these powders consisting of a mixture of 
tartaric acid with bicarbonate of soda from which the 
carbonic acid is set free must pass into the stomach 
as tartrate of soda now neutral tartrates citrates 
and acetates of the alkalis are found in their passage 
through the srstem to be changed into carbonates 
and to convert a tartrate into a carbonate requires an 
additional quantity of oxygen the abstraction of which 
must lessen the oxygen destined for assimilation with 
the blood and to the quantity of which the vigorous 
action of the human system is proportional 

the instances of new theories agreeing with and 
explaining old empiricisms are innumerable all the 
just remarks made by experienced persons on human 
character and conduct are so many special laws which 
the general laws of the human mind explain and 
resolve the empirical generalizations on which the

continually justified and confirmed on the one hand 
or rectified and improved on the other by the disco 
very of the simpler scientific laws on which the 
eflscacy of those operations depends the efitects of 
the rotation of crops of the various manures and the 
other processes of improved agriculture have been 
for the first time resolved in our own day into known 
laws of chemical and organic action by davy and 
liebig the processes of the healing art are even now 
mostly empirical their efficacy is concluded in each in 
stance from a special and most precarious experimental 
generalization but as science advances in discovering 
the simple laws of chemistry and physiology progress is 
made in ascertaining the intermediate links in the series 
pf phenomena and the more general laws on which they 
depend and thus while the old processes are either 
exploded or their efficacy in so far ad real explained 
improved processes founded on the knowledge of 
proximate causes are continually suggested and 
brought into use many even of the truths of 
geometry were generalizations from experience before 
they were deduced from first principles the quadra 
ture of the cycloid was first efiected by measurement 



 it was an old generalization in surgery that tight bandaging 
had a tendency to prevent or dissipate local inflammations this se 
quence being in the progress of physioloal knowledge resolved into 
more general laws led to the important surgical invention reoentlj 
made by dr amott the treatment of local inflammation and 
tumours by means of an equable pressure produced by a bladder par 
tially filled with air the pressure by keeping back the blood front 
the part prevents the inflammation or the tumour from being 
nourished in the case of inflammation it removes the stimulus which 
the organ is unfit to receive in the case of tumours by keeping back 
the nutritive fluid it causes the absorption of matter to exceed the 
supply and the diseased mass is gradually absorbed and disappears

 to the foregoing examples from physical science 
let us add another from mental the following is one 
of the simple laws of mind ideas of a pleasurable 
or painful character form associations more easily and 
strongly than other ideas that is they become asso 
ciated after fewer repetitions and the association is 
more durable this is an experimental law grounded 
upon the method of difference by deduction from 
this law many of the more special laws which experi 
ence shows to exist among particular mental pheno 
mena may be demonstrated and explained — the ease 
and rapidity for instance with which thoughts con 
nected with our passions or our more cherished 
interests are excited and the firm hold which the 
facts relating to them have on our memory the 
vivid recollection we retain of minute circumstances 
which accompanied any object or event that deeply 
interested us and of the times and places in which we 
have been very happy or very miserable the horror 
with which we view the accidental instrument of any 
occurrence which shocked us or the locauty where it 
took place and the pleasure we derive from any 
memorial of past enjoyment all these effects being 
proportional to the sensibiuty of the individual mind 
and to the consequent intensity of the pain or pleasure 
from which the association originated it has been 
suggested by the able writer of a biographical sketch 
of dr priestley in one of our monthly periodicals 
that the same elementary law of our mental consti 
tution suitably followed out would explain a variety

of mental phenomena hitherto inexplicable and in 
particular some of the fundamental diversities of human 
character and genius our associations being of two 
sorts either betwpen synchronous or between suc 
cessive impressions and the influence of the law 
which renders associations stronger in proportion to 
the pleasurable or painful character of the impressions 
being felt with peculiar force in the synchronous class 
of associations it is remarked by the writer referred 
to that in minds of strong organic sensibility syn 
chronous associations will be likely to predominate 
producing a tendency to conceive things in pictures 
and in the concrete clothed in all their attributes and 
circumstances a mental habit which is commonly 
called imagination and is one of the peculiarities of 
the painter and the poet while persons of more mode 
rate susceptibility to pleasure and pain will have a 
tendency to associate facts chiefly in the order of their 
succession and if they possess mental superiority will 
addict themselves to history or science rather than to 
creative art this interesting speculation the author 
of the present work has endeavoured on another 
occasion to pursue farther and to explain by means 
of it the leading peculiarities of the poetical tem 
perament it is at least an example which may 
serve instead of many others to show the extensive 
scope which exists for deductive investigation in the 
important and so eminently imperfect science of

those of a very complex character in which many
