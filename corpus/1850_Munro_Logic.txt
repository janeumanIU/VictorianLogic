the object contemplated in the following pages is to 
present the tyro with a eucdnot yet comprehensive view 
of logic in the simplest possible form 

inetruotiod in logic is now no longer confined to 
colleges and universities it has been introduced into 
many of our schools and bcademies and it is hoped that 
an effort to simpliiy without compromising the dietinc 
tive characteristics of a stady so elegant in its nature and 
so higlily calculated to train the youthful mind to correct 
habits of thought may not be unaooeptahle to the latter 
class of seminaries 

 the irriter has been induced to this undertaking irom 
its having appeared to him when employed as a tutor in 
logic that an elementary manual more simple in its 
phraseology and more copious in illustrations and ex 
amples than any of the treatises now in use might 
tend in some measure to faoilitate an earlier and easier 
aoquaintance with the science than is at present at 



in the hope of securing this object the use of abstract 
symbols in illustration has been almost entirely dis 



hygoogle 



carded foi althoagh coovenjent for the compiler of a 
local treatise and intelligible to the advanced student 
they are invariably uninterebdng if not repulsive to tbe 
beginner 

simplicity has been invaiiably adhered to in selecting 
examples alike in propositions and syllogisms but it is 
hoped that they are not of such a nature as to incur the 
charge of triviality so frequently brought against works 
on logic owing to the meagreness of the illustrations 
usually employed 

the conflicting views entertained regarding the true 
province of logic surround the publication of an ele 
mentary treatise with peculiar difficulties any person 
however who has duly considered the matter can have 
little difficulty in deciding that if logio is to be consi 
dered a distinct and selfsufficient scientific art the for 
mal view mnst be adopted for this is the only aspect 
under which its proper function can be adequately de 
fined and defended it is possible however that the 
disciples of the formal school in their abhorrence of the 
material and verbal views have somewhat overstrained 
their own tlieory and that in order to arrive at a yet 
more satisfactory definition they must either ree to a 
sught compromise or reject as estralogical many mat 
ters admitted at present into logical works 

in declaring his adhesion to the formal view of the 
province of logic the writer readily admits that he has 
introduced into the following pages much that ia extra

logical asd his apolo is that bia object was not to 
vindicate any partioulaz theory but rather to lay before 
the tyro whatever seemed most aseail as an introduotiod 
to the subject more particularly ae it has dot as yet been 
determined to vhat special branch of knowledge matters 
now deemed eztralogical are to be assigned 

the discussion of vexed questions has been altogether 
excluded from the text as their introduction seemed in 
consistent with the plaiuuess requisite in an elementary 
work but when considered necessary they have been 
adverted to in notes 

to the authors of the many very valuable works on 
logic which have recently emanated from oxford the 
writer gratefully acknowledges his obligations the 
treatises alludd to are obviously intended to supply the 
defects and correct the errors of the university text 
book with such additions as have seemed necessary to 
prepare students for the present high standard of logioal 
examinatiods but although extremely valuable in this 
respect the works referred to have left the necessity of a 
work purely introductory unsupplied 

the writer also wiuingly acknowledges the benefits he 
has derived from the unrivalled article by sir w hamil 
ton in the edinburgh beview as may be seen from the 
ample use made of its contents throughout this manual 
to this article the more correct views of the province of 
logic recently adopted in this countiy are mainly 
attributable

introduction 



the oooflicting opinions entertained by writere on logic 
as to its proper province and also as to whether it is an 
art or science or both veriiies the adage — omttis tfinitio 
periculoaa est aristotle has unfortunately left us no de 
finition of logic and from the mixed nature of the con 
tents of the organon it vould certaiiily have been difficult 
to do bo 

that logic is both a science and an art has always been 
admitted by every one acquainted with its proper proirince 
and nature it is a science inasmuch as by analysing 
the elements prinoiples and stmcture of arguments it 
teaches us how to discov their truths or detect tbeir 
fallacies and point out the sources of such errors jt is 
an art inasmuch as it teaches us to arrange arguments 
in suoh a manner as that their truth may be most readily 
perceived or their falsehood detected 

it would be out of place here to enter on an examina 
tion of many definitions as it would lie an unprofitable 
encroachment on space that may be more usefiiuy occu 
pied it is only intended therefore to consider briefly 
those of dr beid archbishop wfaatley and sir william 
hamilton 

h

x inteoddctiom 

accordiug to beid the professed end of logic is to 
teach men to think judge and reason with precision and 
accuracy this definitiod is evidently founded on the 
usual divisioa of the cognitive faculties and on this ac 
count must be considered at least ingenious to think 
is obviously intended to refer to simple apprehension — 
judge to judgment mental or verbal — and reason to 
syllogism but this distribution of the cognitive oulties 
is itself a cross division for the dividing members are not 
distinct they run into one another and consequently 
the same fault characterises the definition founded on 
them logic is certainly furnished th its own peculiar 
niles and canons but rules in any science can never be 
employed for the discovery or investigation of truth their 
sole use and end is to guard against error if this de 
finitioq were to be admitted all known sciences might 
be at once stripped of their distinctive appellations and 
be indiscriminately classed under the name — logic the 
grand error in this definition is however that it confounds 
the material vith the loffical in other words the process 
of investigation with the inference necessitated by the laws 
of thought logic has nothing to do vrith things as they 
exist really and in themselves but only the forms of 
thoufht under which the mind conceives them it is 
oonveraaot solely about second uotjirgt notions hence 
a logical inference is not determined by any oijective 
casualty subsisting between the terms of the premisses 
and conclusion but solely the subjective leintionoiieasoa 
and consequence under which they are construed to the 
mind in thought the question whether the premisses 
of an argument in any objective science are true is no 
doubt a very important one but the logician as such 
cannot be cled upon to answer it he may be able to

introddctioh xi 

answer it but it will be as an astronomer chemiat geo 
logist botanist c as the ease may be bnt not as a logi 
cian for as a logician he is merely responsible for liie 
soundness of the consequent on the assumed truth of the 
antecedent the merit of the correct antecedent is ma 
terial of the correct consequent logical cuique in sua arte 
credendum 

in archbishop whateleys opinion logic the art of 
employing language properly for the purpose of reason 
ing this definition restricts the province of logic to 
the regulation of language it may be a slight improve 
ment on the definition of hobbea viz that logic is the 
art of computation — a kind of mental arithmetic not 
conducted by figures but by words we add for in 
stance two terms to make an affirmation two affirmations 
to mte a syllogism and many syllogisms to make a de 
monstration there is undoubtedly an intimate connec 
tion between thought and language but the regulation 
of language mis within the province of grammar not of 
logic for if it were thought would necessarily be oon 
stdered a function of a language instead of language 
being a function of thought on this definition the 
pointed remarks of mr chretien are conclusive if 
thought be only a function of language man is better 
characterised as a speaking than as a reasoning being 
for it is more natural and more scientific to define by the 
cause than the efiect and then to draw any such in 
ference from mans possessing reason as that his actions 
are therefore probably free or bis thinking nature im 
mortal becomes at once absurd for none will assert 
such hberty or immortality to be a consequence of speech 
of which reason itself is on this theory a consequence

sir william hamilton defiqee logio to be the science 
of the laws of thought as thought — that is of the neoes 
sary conditions to wmoh thought coneidered in itself is 
snbject this is teohnioally called its form this defi 
nition is probably intended as an improtement on that 
given by kant viz the science of the necessary laws of 
the understanding and the reason the definition df 
kant may be simplified by the explanation iht the in 
ferences of opposition and conversion axe considered by 
him as syllogisms of the understanding and the usual 
form of syllogisms as the syllogisms of the reason sir 
william hamiltons definition is here adopted 

in connection with this definilion the foregoing brief 
introdnotory remarks may be very appropriately closed 
with the following judicious passage from mr mansel — 
it is not intended to deny the usefulness of logic but 
it may safely be asserted that its more valuable fruits are 
to be found in the training which the mind unconsciously 
receives than in the oonscious employment of knowledge 
in the formation and examination of reasonings and that 
both in respect of the true character of the science are 
secondary and accidental results — not primary and essen 
tial features

the ancient logic codsiatd of three heads viz simple 
appkbhensioh jddouent and reasoniho the earlier 
logicians considered these in so far as the province of lc 
was concerned as the only operations of the mind from 
its convenience thia distribution of the cognitive faculties has 
still been followed 

under the first head viz simple apprehension notions are 
treated of and these notions when expressed in words are 
called simple terms 

the second head viz judgment treated of the agreement 
or disagreement of any two notions whether mcomplex or 
conqtha when compared together in the mind and this 
comparison is termed a judgment amiipamf and when 
verbally expressed a proposition irirauit 

the third head viz reasoning treated of syllosm or the 
manner in which from two judgments or propositions related

proposition founded npon and resnlling from them 

this division of the mental powers although objecdonable 
ia at all eyenta recommended by its simplicity ita ratwnue 
ia as follows — 

 we first acquire simple notions from these we proceed 
to notions of a more complex character and to the mental 
faculty by which these two classes of notions are acquired 
we give the name simple apprehamon 

 in virtue of our mental constitution when once pos 
sessed of notions we begin to compare hem in other words 
we institute mental judgments as to whether the notions or 
ideas we have acquired by simple apprehension agree or 
disagree with each other j and the judgments thus formed 
when expressed in words we term propotitiom 

a proposition consists of a subject predicate and cila 
the subject is that of which bomethiug is affinned or denied 
the predicate that which is armed or denied of the subject 
and the copula that wliich unites the subject and predicate as 

knowledge is power — 
or disjoins the subject and predicate as 

predacious animals are — not ruminanl

the two conceptions compared 

when comparing ideas we find agreements to be eier 
total or partial and also disagreements to be either total 
or partial hence an affirmative proposition may be either 
ummtsa or particular and a negative proportion also uni 
versal or particular 

 in a syllogism we altematelj compare two terms the 
major and minor with a third called the mvidh term and 
in this way we ascertain whether the two terms alternately 
compared with it agree or disagree witb each other 
 a rular syllogism consists of three proportions the two 
first wre called the premisset and the last the conchuion in 
the premisses the two terms whose agreement or disagreement 
ia sought to be mved are compared with the middle term 
and the new proposition lesolting om them is called the

terms 



a term has been defined to be a vicariom sign of a tkmg 
or idea used hy conventional agreement 

a term ie the sign of a thing when it represents an object 
known hy ay particular sound or combination of sounds 
it is the sign of an ufeawben it conveys by being uttered the 
same idea to the hearers mind which the speaker had in his 
own it is a vicarious mgn because it not only conveys the 
idea of an object but it also supplies the place of that 
object 

whatever sounds therefore are not es institute i e rati 
sed by conventional agreement or mutual consent cannot be 
conudered terms — such as groans shiieksi exclamations c 
which are suggested by nature

term as the queen of england they must expreas a 
completed act of apprehenuon but no more in the propo 
sition 

virtue is its own reward 
the term vthue by iteelf conatitates the subject and the trm 
reward with the adjuncts itt own constitutes liie predicate 
there are therefore only two simple terms 

this class of terms consists either of nonns substantive in 
the nominative case used by themselves nouns substantive in 
 the nominative case with adjunct or verba in the infinitive 
mood — these last being properly speaking nouns substantive 
nouns in the oblique cases are not simple or categorematic 
terms 

but allhoogfa simple or categorematic tenns may be used 
alone either aa the subject or predicate of a proportion they 
may conust of an indefinite number of grammatical words 
provided the combination expresses a complete act of appre 
henuon in the following propositions the subject copula 
and predicate are laid down in regular order the copulas are 
printed in itauct and the grammatical words which express a 
simple complex apprehenaon either as subject or predi

formed by the mind from materials existing in itself as

a corbeot understandiiig of the procesbob indicated by these 
terms respectively will be of advantage in studying the doc 
trine of the predicables 

 abstraction — abbtraction literaliy signifies a drawing 
off or taking aroay from but in its strict and secondary sense 
it means the separate consideration of one or more of the 
parts or qoalitiee of any spedes of whole omittiog or exclud 
ing for the moment all consideration of the other coexisting 
qualities this process invariably precedes generalisatioa 
the parts or qualities excluded at one time may again be 
made the otgects of new abatractioos and become the ground 
work of new classes denoted by common names 

when therefore we draw off and consider separately any 
part or quality of an object presented to ns we are said to 
abitract and with this ample act the province of abstraction 
terminates 

we may for example attend to the fragrance of a violet

and for the moment exclude all consideration of its fyrrn and 
coumr or we maj contemplate ita form and colour diaregard 
ing its fragrance and in either case after this individual 
violet which may have been tiie first we have ever seen is 
withdrawn irom our conraderation we stjll retfun a notion 
of ils fragrance or notions of its form and colour and the 
notions thus retained are pioperlj termed conception 

again a person may have for the first ume seen a sheep 
and may have attended to or abstracted the drcumstance of 
its having four legs excluding from conderation all the 
other goexisting marks and the conceplum remaining in 
the mind afw this individual was no longer present wculd 
be that of a fourfooted animal if be had beard the name 
hee applied while contemplating it this name when ottered 
again in his hearing would also surest the conception of a 
fourfooted animal and in the circumstonoee this would be 
properly termed a reproduced notion 

by abstraction then the mind fastens upon a particular 
quality or mark and separates it from the coexisting aggre 
gate of qualities hence when abstracting wc think of the 
properties or marks and not of tbe object to which they 
belong 

intnce might be multiplied indefinitely but those given 
above will suffice to show the exact nature of what is termed 
abstraction and that it should not be confounded as it too 
frequently is in logical treatises with its coprocess generali 

 gmeralisation — we have seen that in abstracting the 
mind attends to the conuderation of any one or more of tbe 
qualities or parts of any species of real or ideal whole disre 
garding for the moment all the remaining coexisdng parla or 
qualities and that beyond this its province does not extend 
it is manifest however that if we could not classify the 
abstracted attributes or marks according to some relation 
subsisting between tbem our knowledge would be of little

of ihat which is common to them all and therefore makes 
no account of the differences between them in this way 
we obtain a term denoting the inditiduals themselves in

points or circwmstances in which the various individnals 
agree which we call an ahitrctct common term e g from 
noting the various points of agreement in various individual 
kings we obtain the common term king while the term 
royalty which is an abstract common term denotes the 
qualities or properties common to them all and so also in 
the case of any other common term 

in order to generalise it is not necessary that there should 
be an exact resemblance between the objects denoted by a 
common term similarity in certmn points is sufficient 
accidents and nonessential attributes are not taken into 
account if accidents and subordinate properties were re 
garded generalisation would be impossible because no two 
objects are in every respect alike it is by omitting minor 
points of difference that we proceed from individuals 
species and from species to genera 

generalisation must in the first instance be from indivi 
duals to species and in illustration of the process we may 
take socrates aristotle plato kant leibnitz male

bat generalisation a not only lirom individuab to epedea 
we may apply abitraction to tbe common terms denoting 
species and ascend to a class still higher tbe words deff 
tkeep cow lion horte each denote a common notion obtained 
by abstraction and generalisation from the individuals of 
which th are reepeotjvel predicable and as in these we 
discover attributes cammon to all of them we may resome 
the former process and divest these classes of their respective 
formal characteristics and express the notion comprehending 
all the marks in which they resemble each other by the com 
mon term quadruped generalisation may evidently be 
carried to almost any extent by considering common nouns 
for instance quadruped as nngulari for by omitting their 
points of difference we arrive at new aggregates expressed by 
more general terms thus from quadruped we may arrive 
at the more general term animal and from animal we may 
obtain the still more general term corporeal being by pro 
ceeding in this way laying aside points of difierence and 
considering only points of resemblance we arrive ultimately 
at mbitance or being the highest possible generalisation 

it win be seen om the foregoing that abstraction is in a 
certain sense analytic in its character for by it we separate 
mentally all tbe attributes and marks of a whole generalisa 
tion is on the other baud synthetic in its nature for by it 
we collect into classes all such attributes or marks of wholes as 
have common points of resemblance or freement 

it is not requisite that the individuals om which we 
obttdn a common or general notion should coexist suc 
cession in point of time is sufficient e g we could have 
the common notion king if only one had existed at a given 
time in the same manner as we have the common notion 
pfit which is founded on the points of agreement noted in a 
succession of individual popes we can reason about either 
of them without necessarily referring to any one individual

before nominaliam took its rise this doctrine waa generally 
considered heterodui they acquiesced in it only in conceiv 
iag the universal to be an actual existence they held that 
genera and species were really existing things — that they 
existed actually as substances and not merely as conceptions 
of the mind — that there was an universal man exbdng as one 
and the same in socrates and plato and all the individuals of 
the spedes — and that the various individuals are formed by 
the addition of accidents to the species

he held that nniversals were nothing but namet itoscelin 
was followed by abelard wtto held an intermediate view 
between absolute nominalism and realism he believed 
universals to be conceptions but without an independent and 
olqeotive reality in order however that these conceptions 
sbould be formed and retained in the mind they must rest on 
the signs of language but he made conceptions turn on the

until the days of occam whose opinions correspond with that

virtue of its signification which is a sign of many things 
the following is a specimen of his reasoning — if the realist 
opinion he remarks were true god could not anni 
hilate one individual without destroying all for to annihilate 
one individual he rauet destroy all that is of its essence 
consequently he must destroy the universal which exists

the extension of a teroi means the number of individual 
things of which severally that tenn may be predicated in 
other words it regards the number of species into which a 
genus or the number of individuals into which a species may 
be divided thus of the term jlomer the parts of extension 
are violet liiy bluebell daisy buttercup a because of all 
these and of as many more as answer to the description the 
term flower may be predicated for as we have seen com 
mon tenns denote a whole class and any individual in that 
class and may therefore be predicated of all or any one of 
these individuals 

the parts of extension of a genus are consequently the 
species contained under it and of a species the individuals 
contained tinder it 

the comprehendon — otherwise called the intension— of a 
term means all the simple notions which taken together 
make up the more complex notion signified by the teim 
in other words it is the aggregate of all the known properties 
of a genus species or individual to which it may be applied 
thus the notions of euiuamx body life lengation and 
reawn are the parts of comprehension of tbe term man 

by keeping in view what is meant by the extmion and 
what by the compreketuion of a term it will be seen that a 
singular term has the least exiension of all for it can only 
be predicated of the one individual thing to which it belongs 
while on the contrary a singular term has a greater compre 
hension than a term denoting a class i e a common term 

of common terms some have a wider and some a more 
restricted extension according to the number of things to 
which they may be applied in the same sense common

hascal q logic 

tenns denote an aregate of diigulars clabsed blether 
and the extension of a tenn will therore depend on the 
amount of generality which an attribute or mark possesses 
or ihe number of individuals to which it belongs thua the 
common t£rni man has a greater extension than the common 
term city as it can be predicated of a greater number of 
irutividttab the term cit again has a greater extension 
than the term uaivernty and tree than river and so on 
the extension therefore or as it may be termed the quantity 
of a term is the number of individuals contained under it 
and of all or any one of which it may be predicated in the 
same sense 

by making terms the objects of reflection we shall dis 
cover that some involve a smaller and others a greater num 
ber of ideas in other words that some are less aod others 
more compleas according to the number of component parts of 
which they consist e g the notion expressed by the term 
jioner is less eomex than that expressed by the term violet 
— for this reason that the term violet implies all the ideas or 
component parts of the term fiower and in addition all the 
notions which distinguish that parldcular species of flower 
from all others 

it follows that the aggregate of simple notions which make 
vp the more complex notion expressed by a terra consti 
tutes what is called its comprehension and also that differ 
ent terms hate a greater or smaller compreheaon in pro 
portion to the degree of complexity tjiey imply this may 
easily be seen by analysing or resolving a term into its com 
ponent ideas or parts 

the terms instanced in viz jiotver and violet may be 
viewed then under two different aspects — st with regard 
to the number of individuals of which they may be predi 
cated and d with rard to the complexity of the notions 
which they imply or in other words with regard to their 
extmon and comprehension

on considerlag these terms closely we discover that the 
term which has the greater extension has the smaller com 
prehensioq and vice versa the notion expressed by the 
term vuilet is more complex or consists of a greater number 
of simple notions than the complex notion expressed by the 
tena jiomer and the individuals of which the term violet may 
be affirmed or which may be termed violett are fewer in 
number than the individuals which may be ttnaajlowers 

for in addition to die notion of an individual of the flower 
tribe the term violet is intended to express the notions of a 
particular form colour and fragrance which some flowers 
have and which some have not and as these notions of 
form colour aui fragrance are contained in the comprehen 
sion of the term violet that name can only be affirmed of such 
flowers as have that particular form colour and fragrance 

it follows from this that each component notion in the 
comprehension of a term limits the application of such term 
to those things which have a correbpouding character and 
therefore that the greater the comprehension of a term the 
smaller is the number of individual objects to which it may 
be appued or the less is its extension 

the comprehension of a term denotes its extension sup 
posing that we know the term rhinoceros to denote an ani 
mal and that we wish to ascertain what other animals may 
be called by that name we must in the first place learn the 
exact meaning of the term i e we must become acquainted 
with all the less complex notions which when taken together 
form the more complex notion expressed by that term and 
when we have ascertained all these and see some other 
animal which does not possess corresponding attributes we 
affirm immediately that this animal is not a rhinoceros or 
that this individual animal is not included in the extension of 
the term rhinoceros since the term can only be applied to 
such animals as possess attributes corresponding to the com 
plex notion expressed by that word

luhdal of loaic 

it frequently hppens that the comprehension of one term 
is inclnded in the eomprehensioa of another e g the com 
prehension of the term fimver is incladed in that of the term 
violet for all the component notions that make up the term 
jlorcer are implied also in the term xaout but it has its own 
pecoliar attributes besides in this case the extension of the 
latter most be included in the extension of the former for 
since the notion of a jlower iucludea in it no attributes that 
are not also contained in the notion of a violet every indivi 
dual that may be named a violet must posbeas all the attributes 
which the comprehension of the term flower includes and 
may be therefore also named a jfenwr or is contned in the 
exteneionof the yrorajlomer 

since the comprehension of a term determines its exten 
sion it is manifest that if the comprehension of any two 
terms be idendcal their extension must also be identical and 
that if the extenuon of any two terms be the same so in like 
maouer most be uieir comprehension 

it will easily bo seen from the foregoing that a singular 
term has of all terms the smallest extension as it consists of 
only one individual while its comprehension on the other 
hand must be greater than that of any common term for 
peculiar attributes enter into its comprehension which cannot 
enter into that of any common term 

in the highest genus the comprehension is necessarily the 
least and the extenrion greatest while in the lowest species 
the comprehension is greatest and the extension least

the processes of abstraction and generalisation as has been 
already observed are subordinate to that classified atrange 
ment of conceptions which renders our absolute knowledge 
practicallj adrantageods itui amidst the mass of general 
notions acquired the mind discovers certfun distjaguishing 
qualities which may form the basis of a new and complete 
arradgenient of them nnder certain distinct heads many

which has been generally adopted is the fivefold division into 
genus ytof differentia fcapoga epecies iiini proprium 
liim and accident miistixog these are named the five 
jyredicables or univenals 

the tcnn predicable has been defined nomen commune 
univotmm tecunda intentionis or a common unifocal noun 
of the tecond intension it is univocal because althongh 
applicable to many individuals it is considered as representa 
tive of only one idea and it is of the second intention as 
being the conception of a conception 

the object of the doctrine of the predioables is to reduce 
to certain classes all conceivable predicates or whatever can 
be logically asserted about any subject

there are gve distinct classes of relatiods which may ob 
tain between a subject and a predicate for of any subject we 
may affirm its genus or its differentia or its species or its 
proprittm or ila accidens 

id conceiving of some imaginary common nature — as 
man triangle — we are naturally led to conceive also that 
this supposed essence or nature is composed of parts and 
that the conception of it may therefore be resolved into more 
simple conceptions for instance the conception of man 
resolves itself into those of animality and rationality tri 
angle into jigure aai the qaalitj of having three sides these 
again suggest other conceptions as belonging to the primary 
essence or nature as risibility nobility to tnan the jiaving 
three angles the being equilateral to triangle 

these in their order we tenn the essence the part of the 
ttsmmre and the quality joined to the essence the essence 
 of two parts of which one is conunon to it and to 
essences as animality is common to man and hrute 
to triangle circle square c the other is peculiar 
essence and distinguishes it from all others and forms 
which it is i e rationality distinguishes man from 
er animals the having thret sides distinguishes tri 
rom all other figures 

the quality joined to the essence may be twofold 
ng either necessarily or contingently united with it 
with man the idea of risibility is ttecessarily joined 
jie ideas of nobility tallness c are only contingently 
with triangle the having three angles is necessarily 
 being equilateral or isosceles c is only accidentally 

se have been termed as above stated the five predic 
ir universals it may be proper to remark however 
lie predicable and the universal are not one and the 
the former is the sign expressive of the latter the 
¦ibu is that which is asserted of many and the uniner

expressing the whole essence that no predicate can com 
pletely and strictly express the tvhole essence of its subject 
unless it be another word of the very same import and co 
extensive with it as wellington was the conqueror of 
napoleon the words whole essence must therefore be un 
derstood as meaning only the whole that any common term 
can express i e the nearest approach to the whole essence 
of the individual that any term not synonymous with the 
subject can denote 
 when species is spoken of as a vshole this ia property in 
reference to the genus and differentia each of which denotes 
a part of that species which is constituted by the union of 
both 

species being the whole essence as ezpliuned above 
necessarily implies the genus which is a part of that essence

diffeiuintia 



differentia is a predicable predicated in quale quid 
af rtfi voiot ti of maj things differing either in pecie 
or in numher as the dutmguismng part of their essence 

it has been already shown that things are said to difier in 
species or specifically when viewed as divided iato different 
classeand to difittr in number or nnmerically when viewed 
only as iudividoals 

the difiereotia is the formal or dittinguiskuy part of an 
essence and is variously termed the essential difference or 
attribute the divisive and constitutive part and in common 
discourse the chataetethstic par it must be podlive not 

a difierantia belongs to a species alone and every species 
included under a graius must have a differentia peculiar and 
belonging to itself exdusively in order to distinguish it from 
every other species of the same genus thus under the 
genus plane figure we have the species triangle square 
circle oblong c each of which has its own formal or 
distinguishing part in addition to the common or material 
part plane figure e g the being contained by three side is 
the essential difference of a triangle for it conslitntea the dis 
tinction between it and ail other figures since no figure can 
be a triangle which is not contained by three aides nor can 
any threesided figure be anything but a tritme 

the differentia first divides the genus and then constitutes 
the spedes thus the genus animal is divided into two dis 
tinct species by adding the attribute rational to one part of it

witb respect to its dividing the genus it has been termed 
dioitive differentia divisiva and with respect to its con 
stitnting the species it has been termed eongtitulive diser 
entia constitativa 

it is by the differentia that the varioas species contained 
under a genus become opposed to each other and such oppo 
ntjon consists in each species having some one essential 
attribute peculiar to itself alone in short it signifies the 
attribute which distinguishes a given species from every other 
species of the same genus 

porphyry gives five definitions of rather explanadons of 
the differentia but they are alt substantially one for the same 
difierenlia is either formal or divisive or constitutive c„ 
according to the view in which it is for the thne regarded

the five predicables or nniversala aa has been shown do 
not express anj actually existing tmng they are merely

classified under certtun distinct heads they express second 
not first notions in nature we find no actually existing 
thing corresponding to genus species or any of the other 
predicables they indicate conceptions not reaiittet 

second notions however presuppose first notions and as 
under the predicables we classify conceptions so under the 
categories we classify realities or distribute into classes all 
tjie possible real things about which we can discourse 

id short a perfect list of categories or predicaments would 
be a classification of whatever can be the subject or predicate 
of a proposition while tbe predicables are a clafication of 
all the possible afbrmations about these things 

the usual distribution of the categories according to the

exacuf coincide i e the idea conveyed b the term is the 
same as tlie nature of the thing thus a triangle is that 
which has three sides which is both a domiaal and real 
definition 

id real definion we explain not only tlie meaning of the 
term but also the nature of the thing ugnified by it 

beal definition is of two kinds accidental and enential 
otherwise called imperfect and perfect it is common to 
both that they are used in explaining things not nartua 

in accidental definition we describe or enumerate some of 
the jyroperties or accidents of what is implied by a term 
this kind of definition is therefore usually termed descrip 
tion any definition may be considered accidental where 
only tbe genus and a property occur for a property must in 
all cases be regarded aa an actudent unless it is deduced from 
a known differentia the following are examples of actndental

heat is the sensation produced by approaching fire 
man is a risible animal 

animal is a body which can move itself from place to 
place 

ink is a liquid used for the purposes of writing and printing 

accidental definition is frequently the only method by 
which we are able to define a thing or term represenliag it 
in consequence of our ignorance of the characteristic quality 
which constitutes the difierentia in such cases we often find 
it necessary to enumerate a number of marks or attributes 
the aggregate of which must be considered as the diflerentia 
until we are able to single out some particular attribute sa

positions and the predicate in all negative propositions since 
in the former the entire conception is included while in the

the common term tyrants includes dionysius fhraates

no islands are surrounded by water 
everything of which the common term ¦ island can be 
affirmed is excluded from the application of the predicate 
 surrounded by water in other words none of the signlfi 
cates of the term island agrees with the predicate 

since the distribution of the terms of propositions is indi 
cated by the universality of the subject or the negative cha 
racter of the propoution it is maniiest that in all particular 
propositions the subject ia undistributed as it atands only for 
a part of its significates being restricted te this either by its 
indefinite character or some quahfyiag term in the example 

some islands are fertile 
the term island though applicable in its unrestricted sense

it is evident therefore that the distribution or nondistribu 
tioa of a term depends on its quantity and not on its quality 

it follows from the ioregoing that the subject of an inde 
finite propcatjoq in neceisary matter ia distributed la uie 
example 

angels are incorporeal 
although there is no sign of uuiverbality prefixed to the sub

ter on the other hand ia undistribnted in the example

 of the predicate 

the predicate xttrjiydtuivov of an afiirmatite proposition 
with few exceptions is never distributed in the following 
example of a universal affirmativei viz 

all metals are fusible 
the predicate fusible is not distributed for although it is 
affirmed of all metak this does not exhaust its application 
inasmuch as it is predicable of many other substances be 
sides metals and consequently it cannot be said to be wholly 
distributed since the tiject of the proposition does not ex 
press all the substances capable of being fused 

this is still more obvious in the case of a particular 
affirmative e g

vapours but of an indefinite variety of bodies

it happens occanonallj that the permeate is of equal exteat 
with the subject i e that the predicate full distritmted may 
be affirmed of the enbjt also fully distributed the judg 
menta expressed in propositjous of this nature are said to be 
tiastttutive for since in them the predicate is used to define 
the eulect the whole of it must be given otherwise it would 
be useless for dcgnition the subject and predicate are 
therefore exactly coextensive for they may change places in 
the judgment so that the defiuitum may in its tarn become 
a definition e g in the example man is a ratioual animal 
no individual comes into the class of ratiotiat animau which 
b not also in man and conversely no individua comes 
under man which is not also under rational animal for 
here both the subject and predicate are generalisations om 
the very same class of beings — the only difference being 
that the subject is symbolical or the sign of a class while 
the predicate is nolative that is noting essential attributes 

it is only in definitions that the subject and predicate are 
coextensive and this coincidence occurs wherever the predi 
cate is a definition of the subject as 

rhetoric is the art of speaking persuad vely 
or its logical difierence as 

all men are rational 

a proposition is a declaratory sentence 
or a specific property as 

a triangle b a figure having three angles 

a proposition is aseatence signifying something trueor false 
or in any case in short where the subject and predicate are 
simply convertible 

in these examples the predicate may in its distributed 
sense be afbnned of the sulgect but it is to be observed 
that this circumstance cannot he inferred from the mere form 
of the proposition it follows from the matter not from the 
terms of the expression 



hygootjie 



the judgment expressed b any propodtion in vhich the 
subject and predicate are not coextensive is said to be attri 
butive as the predicate merely exprebses an attribute not 
simply convertible with the eubject and cannot therefore be 
used to define the subject e g 

metab are fuuble 

gold is heavy 
are jadgments in which this kind of predicate occurs 

in negative propoeitions whether universal or particntar 
the predicate must be distributed otherwise the proportion 
could net be true e g the proposition 

irrational animals are not morally responsible 
would be felse if any part of the predicate morally respon 
sible agreed with the subject irratioaal animals 

in particular negatives however the distribution of the 
predicate is not so evident e g the propositioa 

some critics are not candid 
asserts that there is a certain class of critics comprised in the 
subject from which everif individual of which the predicate 
can be affirmed is wholly excluded in other words the pre 
dicate candid in its most extensive signification cannot bq 
aflirraed of any individual comprised under the particular 
class of critics denoted by the subject consequently the pre 
dicate is used here in its universal i e its distrumted sense 
and unless it were so the propositioa would not be true 

no signs of universality or particularity are prefixed to the 
predicitte because in affirmative propositions its nondistribu 
tion is indicated by the affirmation and in negative proposi 
tions its distribution is indicated by the negation 
i it has been shown above that a term may consist of one 
word or several j but the only terms consisting of one word 
which can be used as the subjects or predicates of proposi 
tions are nouns substantive in the nominative case we may 
add here that the infinitive of a verb a certain form of which 
is only one word may iqso be used as a term in a proposition

the infinitive in ing may be used as a categorem ie 
as a word having enough of independent meaning in itself to 
constitutfl a term as

or it may be used as a syncatgorem i e as oonslitnting a

accuracy in observing individual ctb is necessary to cor

it may be remained that the infinitive is often the predi

another infinitive is the subject e g

laborare est orare 

it may be remained that neither the infinitive which is 
properiy a nounsubstantive nor the participle which is a 
nounttdjective is indnded under the word verb ka stricily 
speaking they are verbals i e they have a relation to their 
verbs in signification but they differ from them in the mode 
of signification this arises from the uroumstance that

haviko already conadered the first bead of the logical dis 
tribntion of the cognilire faculties vis simple apprehension 
and having treated of notions as simple or complex of terms 
as singular or common together with their names and classi 
fications as well as the logical instnimeats wherehj we ac 
quire distinctness in the apprehension of the meaning and use 
of terms we now proceed to the second head viz judgtiient 
under this head we connder the mind not onl as possess 
ing notions distinctly but as capable of comparing tbem to 
gether and of asserdng some relation between them whether 
of agreement or disagreement while sucb assertion remuns 
purely a mental act it is called a judgment but when it is 
expressed in words it is termed a propotition 

of sihflz propositions 

a proposition is defined by aldrich to be oratio indica 
tiva congrua et perfecta verwn vel faltum ngaijieam giite 
ambiguitate — an asserting sentence grammatical and perfect 
signiiyiag something true or false and tree from ambiguity 
this definition is of a mixed natnre it is partly metaphy 
rical and partly accidental it is metaphysical in so r as

it defines a propoutioa to be an atterting tmience oratio 
indicativa but it is accidental in so r aa it states it to be 
true or falte — and accidents should be excluded om tbe 
definition of what is implied j a common term 

this objection to die definition of aldrich may be removed 
by restricting the definition to the two first words oratio 
indicativa an eutertutg tenuaee for a propodlionj locauy 
defined is a sentence which asserts i e affirms or deaiea 
this latter definition willonseqnentij ooftiprehend the whole 
essence of a proposition for a tmtence is its gemu and 
mterting i e affirming or denying its difference 

since therefore a proposition must assert i e affirm or 
deny some thing all exclamatioru interrogatiom requetu

excluded as for ezamplo 

oh how amiable are thy dweliings i

in a legitimate proposition the four following conditions 
are requisite — 

 wihi regard to the words it most be a sentence which 
affirms or denies as 

all beasts of prey are camivoroua 
the earth is not a plane 

 in respect of signification it must signify something 
tine as 

the air is elaslio 
or blse as 

moonlit is cold 

 a proposition must not be ambiguous in other ynrda 
it must not admit of dubious construction for if it did it 
would be more than one tentence and iostead of being oratio 
iudicativa an asserting sentence it would be orationes in 
dicative asserting sentences

a pure categoric proposition simply asserts whether the

virtue is its own reward 

benevolence is not the whole of virtue 

man is not infallible 

a pure categorical proposition is eometiines called propo

gorical proposition expresses in what inorfe or manner the 
subject does or does not agree with the predicate as

modal propositions may be reduced to pure categoricals hy

united to tiie predicate and thus forming a part of it as 

man is necessarily an animal 
or sometimes by attaching the word denoting the mode to the 
subject which may be done when the mode only expresses 
whether the matter of the extremes be necessary impossible

 of the quality of propomtions 

the qnality of a proposition is of two kinds esiential and 
accidentdl 

the quality of the expression of a proposition constitates 
its euential qoality because affirmation or negation forms 
the lineal difierence or formal part of the essence and is the 
only differentia from which all the propria may be deduced 

the qoality of the seme is the accidental quality because 
the expression of truth and of falsehood is the property and 
gonsequedtly only an adjunct to the essence 

when the tenn qualityis used concerning propositions with 
out any distinguishing epithet the essential quality is signified 

the essential quality of a proposition is determined by the 
copula and hence it must be carefiilly observed when a sign 
of negation occurs in a proposition whether it really afficts 
the copula this may be done in any case by analysing the 
proposition and making allowance for the idiom of the language 
in which it is expressed in a strictly logical point of view 
the negative particle is always considered to afifect the copula 
in whatever part of a proposition the idiom of any particu 
lar language may place it and for this reason propositions

a proposition metaphysically universoz is that in which the

every man is an animal 

all circles have a centre and circumference

in each of these examples the predicate agrees with all the

a proposition morauy universal is that in which the pre 
dicate agrees with most of the individuals of the subject but 
not widi all e g — 

all men prefer their own interest to the public 

in this example the predicate in its agreement with the 
individuals of tlie subject admits of some exceptions from 
this proposition therefore we may deduce a particular pro

a modal proposition of this deacription connsts of what is 
termed the dictum and the modus the dictum is the sub 
ject and the modus the predicate in the esamples given 
already tliere is no difficull in diatioguisbing the subject 
trom the predicat for the stand in tiieir legitimate order 
while the natureof tbeir reladon is determined by the word 
qualifying the copula and the relation maybe eitlier that 
of necessity possibility impossibility or contingency but 
propositions often occur usually considered modal in which 
it is often requisite to alter the arrangement of the words in 
which they are expressed in order to see clearly which is the 
dictum and which the modus in such cases it is necessary 
first to ascertain the term or the parlicular number of words 
constituting a term which represents the dictum and when 
this is ascertained all that remains is to connect the term 
constituting the modus with the copula — for the modus must 
be always joined to the copula — and what is so joined is the 
predicate in the following proposition yz 
it is necessary that a man should be an animal 

there is a necessity of agreement asserted between the subject 
and predicate and on examining the proposition we find that 
a man should be an animal is the dictum or subject and 
 necessary the modus or predicate by uniting the modus 
with the copula the proposition will stand thus 

that a man should be an animal is necessary 

it is evident that the first kind of modal propositions men 
tioned viz those in which the subject and predicate occupy 
their legitimate places may be multiplied to any extent for 
any adverb afiecting the copula and thereby qualifying the 
predicate or even an adjective qualifying the subject is suf 
ficient to rank the proposition in which it occurs in this class 
of modals it may be remarked however that this indefinite 
mulfiplicalion of modals is not to be attributed to aristotle i

and t 

appear although as well as the former easily redui 
categorical form will if they are to be resolved into the dictom 
and modus which they easily may be constitute a second 
class of modals equally numeroas if however modality is 
to be restricted to one or both of these classes and it would 
appear that these are the only kinds of it recognisable in pure 
logc as they necessitate under certain conditions a corres 
ponding modification of their immediate or mediate conse 
quents a uttle consideration will suffice to show that the pro 
positions falling under either of the classes should be designated 
propositions verbally modal — their modality being expressed 
not implied for in all cases by a slight alteration in the 
phraseology or a different arrangement of the order of the 
terms they may be reduced to pure categorical proposi 
tions 

whether modality either expressed or implied in a propo 
rtion should be relegated from the domain of pure logic is a 
question among logicians some holding the formal view 
admit the expressed but reject the implied while others ex 
clude both no sufficient reason has been shown however 
why expressed modality should foe banished irom pure logic 
for if a premiss is assumed under a necessity or probability 
or possibility of being true any of these conditions will in a 
corresponding degree determine the conclusion to be deduced 
which under any of these assumptions will be as purely logi 
cal as that the tmth of the conclosiou follows irom the truth 
of the premisses or the labdty of the concluraon from the falsity 
oi the premisses 

in applied logic on the other hand there seems no reason 
yihy implied modali should not be recognised and hence 
the modality of a proposition would depend in many cases 
not on the effeot a qualifying epithet may have on the copula

aristotle whose view of modality may be with some strain 
ing interpreted either as expreaed or understood in a pro 
position enumerates four modes viz the necessary artvyxain 
the impossible aiuvaret the contingent nisxof and the 
possible iuvanr hthether he added the true axji and 
the dux ttktiti is not quite clear from his claaufica 
tion of judgments however and the grounds on which they 
must be explained it may be presumed that he would not 
exclude implied modality from applied logic in this view 
therefore the modality of a judgment in applied logic may 
depend on our knowledge of facts and things or tite degree 
of certtunty wilh which we can assert the agreement or dis 
agreement of any given subject and predicate hence the 
modali of our judgments will vary with the increase of our 
knowledge and what ia problematical at one time may 
amount to belief at another the objective clfi and things 
concerning which we judge remain the same whatever 
changes may take place in the qiind of the thinker aa to 
clearer apprehensions of them the change is subjecttve not

on examining aristotles four modes it will appear that all 
possible judgments may be reduced to three classes viz the 

problematical 

assertory and 

demonstrable 

this is aristotles distribntdon all judgments which are 
merely matters of opinion come under the class problemati 
cal all judgments founded on belief may be referred to the 
dabs assertory while all judgments resnlting from the 
amoms and deductions of pure science belong to the cuss 
 demonstrable

 uaktial of logic 

of the three the pnlematical judgment is obviously the 
weakest for it is neither regarded as true by the thinker 
nor can it be shown to be a true decision in reference to the 
object or thing concerning which the judgment is made 
consequently it cannot be hud down as truth either in a 
suttjectitc or olijective nse in illustration let us lake the 
following example — 

the solar system may be a gradual projection from the sun 

in this judgment there may be either a total partial or no 
agreement between the subject and predicate but from our 
imperfect knowledge of the objectmatter of the judgment 
we can only atbrm a possible dependence or agreement be 
tween them the judgment may indeed be true and farther 
knowledge may prove it so but now it is merely matter of 
opinion 

all judgments which rest on pombtuly or probability or 
to which doubt attaches in the mind of the thinking subject 
may be classed under problematical judgments 

the learner should obserte that in propositions the words 
maybe often occur in two different senses in ihe proposi 
tion the world may be circumnavigated maybe means 
is capable of being and e proposition is assertory while ia 
the proposition all tlie species in the world may be the off 
spring of a few primary species may be means are for 
anything rve hnow and the proposition is problematical 

an assertory judgment implies belief in addition to opinion 
and is therefore subjectively true i e held as true by the 
thinker an assertory judgment may also be true with re 
spect to the fact or object regarding which it is made but its 
truth objectively is indemonstrable an assertory judgment 
is therefore subjectively true but not objectively certain 
the following is an example of an assertory judgment — 

a mixed monarchy is the best form of government 



hygoogle 



logic 

and to a person holding this opinion as belief the judgment 
¦is suhjectjtelj true inasmuch as the thinking subject believes 
it to be so objectively however it is not certain for one 
may believe the democratic a second the despotic and a 
third the patriarchal to be the best form of government an 
assertory differs firom a demonstrable judgment in this that 
however firm our own belief may be in the truth of an asser 
tory judgment we cannot compel men in general to acquiesce 
in it because however strong the evidence in its favour may 
be it cannot amount to absolute demonstration 

belief in the truth of an assertory judgment may be con 
fined to one thinking subject because he may have examined 
the objectmatter of it more carefully and minutely than 
other thinking subjects or he may have been influenced by 
prejudice inlerest or any other adequate cause 

belief in the truth of an assertory judgment may be com 
mon to any particular sect or school e g calvinists may be 
lieve in common that calvins institutes are the best compend 
of theology the same holds true in the case of political 
classes or in philosophical schools c this coincidence of 
belief may arise from similarity in habits of thought or from 
educational training or any cause sufbcient to present a judg 
ment to the mind of the thinking sutect as true 

belief in the truth of an assertory judgment may be com 
mon to all e g that there is a first cause that there is 
a day of final retribution that there is a future state are 
matters to which univetal belief is acceded although not 
susceptible of absolute demonstration 

in every case the truth of an assertory proposition whe 
ther held by an individual or a class or men in general 
depends on moral not on demonstrable certainty 

belief in the truth of a demonstrable judgment occupies 
the highest plac in the scale of credibility it is not only 
subjectively but also objectively true and differs conse 
quently both from the problematical and assertory judgment

section iii 

the opposition of propositions 

froposiuons have hitherto been treated in their absolute 
character we now proceed to consider them in their relative 
character or affections the relative afiections of proposi 
tions are of three kinds viz staaltemation conversion and 
oppodtion a knowledge of these is subservient to the doc 
trine of syllogisms for by subaltemation we infer several 
conclusions irom the same premisses by opposition we reduce 
imperfect moods to perfect while conversion aids in both 
 subaltemation 

subaltemation is the deduction of a particular or singular 
proposition from a universal — both namely the premiss and 
deduction having the same subject and the same predicate 
snbaltemation is either between a and i or £ and 

the two propositions compared together are — the one a 
universal proposition called the suhaltemans the other de 
duced from the former and called the euhaltema — a particu 
lar or singular proposition with the same subject and the 
same predicat in all cases the subaltemans and snbaltema 
must agree in quality e g — 

a all diseases are contagious 

i some diseases are contaous 



hygoogle 



manual of loaio ill 

the principle on which subaltemation proceeds u that 
uuiversals include particularb but that particukrs do not 
include universala 

from any universal proposition we may infer a particular 
subalterna but before we can infer a singular auballema 
the subaltemans muet be metaphysically nniveraal the 
following is an example of a proposition metaphyaically uni 
versal viz 

every effect has a cause 

and as it is metaphysically universal that is admitting of do 
exceptions we can infer from it not only the particular 

proposition 

some effects have causes 
but also the singular proposition — 

gravitation has a cause 

the relation between a suballernans and a subalterna can 
scarcely be called opposition in the common acceptation of 
the term though it comes within the range of the definition 
of that term as here used 

in pronouncing on the truth or falsehood of propositions 
thus related we have to consider how far we may infer the 
truth or falsehood of one of iheai from the truth or falsehood 
of the other and in reference to snbaltemation we have the 
four following axioms — 

 the truth of the universal infers the truth of the par 
ticular — for if it be true that 

all islands are surrounded by water 
it must be true that 

some islands are surrounded by water 
and it is also true that 

sicily is an island aurronnded by water

 makttai op logic 

in this esample however we infer a singular suhauema 
because the subalternans is metaphysically universal 

a sign of universality prefixed to the subject of a proposi 
tion docs not let it be observed necessarily render that pro 
position metaphysically true eg the following proposition — 

all children reverence their parenia 
is only morcdly anivenial and therefore admits of some excep 
tions for all children donot reverence theirparents and hence 
although from such a proposition we can infer with truth that 

some children reverence their parents 
we cannot infer his with regard to any particular individual 
contained in the subject for it may be among the exceptions 

the truth of this axiom is equally valid in negative as 
in affirmative propositions for if in affirmative propositions 
the predicate contains the whole extension of the subject it 
contains a part and if in negative propositions it excludes 
the whole it excludes a part 

it will be seen om the foregoing ihat the suhalternans and 
the subaltema deduced from it difier in quantity but agree 
in quality 

 llie truth of the particular does not infer the truth of the 
universal 

the predicate of a proposition may agree with a part of 
the extenaiod of the sulgect yet it may not agree with the 
whole extension of the subject for although it may be true that 

some wars are just 
it is not trae that 

all wars are jnst 
and although it may be true that 

some men have not an affectiondte disposition 
it is not true that 

no men have an affectionate disposition

in referenc to the terms of a proposition it is to be laid 
down that in inference no trm can be changed from a 
particular to an aniversal in other words that an argument 
a particulari ad univermu is invalid for if anj term is 
particular a part of it only is stud to agree or disagree witb 
the other term about the remaining part of it therefore 
nothing can be inferred 

 the falsehood of the particular infers the felsehood of 
the universal 

in illustration of this axiom it my be stated that if it be 
false that the predicate contains or agrees with any part of 
the extension of the subject it must also be false that it con 
tains the whde for instance if it is false that 

some men are patriotic 

it must be iee tiiat 

all men are patriotic 

 the msehood of the universal does not infer the felse 
hood of the particular 

it may be false for instance that the predicate contains or 
excludes the whole extension of the subject jet it may con 
tain or exclude a part thus it may be lse that 

all men are logicians 
or that 

no island is fertile 
yet it may be true that 

some men are logicians 
or that 

some islands are not fertile

the first and the fourth in the second 

the third and fourth axioms differ from the first and

 contradictory opposition 

ckintradictoi opposition is that which subsists between tvro 
propositions differing both in quantity and quality viz be

 some men are not responsible 

of all the kinds of opposition the contradictory is the 
most peict for contmdiclories differ from each other in all 
points in quantity for one is universal and the other par 
ticular in quality for one is affirmatite and the other nega 
tive hence it follows that when a proposition is trme its 
contradictory must of necessity bejiie and conversely if a 
proposition is fiilse its contradictory must be true lliere 
can be no intermediate judgment consequently contradic 
tories can neither be both eiee nor both true together for 
the isity of the one establishes the truth of the other 

in order that two propositions should he directly contra 
dictory the terms of both the propositions must be used in 
exactly the game tente with respect to each other the con 
ditions necessary to ensure this are the following viz that the 
terms of the contradictories must be used — 

 eodem modo io the same manner

connection between the extremes is not invariable and essen 
tial and that all we can assert with truth is that 
 some human inventions are beneficial to mankind 
hence there is a part of the subject with which the predicate 
does not ree and with respect to the part excluded it may 
be asserted that 

some human inventions are not beneficial to mankind

 dgosition of singular propositions 

it is difficult to refer the opposition of singular propositions 
sometimes called secondary contradictioti to any particular 
kind of opposition ostensibly their opposition is that of 
contrariety for their quantity cannot be changed 

the matter of singular propositions cannot be contingent 
and consequently two singular propositions cannot both be 
false as may happen in the case of contraries when they are 
both in contingent matter the opposition of singulars is 
therefore not properly referrible to contrariety 

singular propositione must be either in necessary or im 
possible matter and hence the contrary to a singular propo 
sition forma as perfect an opposition as the contradiction 
between nniversals and particulars for they have the essential 
features of contradictories viz that the one is alwa true 
and the other blse for if a singular be true its contrary 
must of necessity be folse and vice versa since in necessary 
or impossible matter no two opposed propositions can be both 
true or both false together

conversion is the transposition of uie subject of a proposi 
tion into tile place of tlie predicate and of the predicate into 
the place of the subject bat in the transposition both the 
quality and the truth of the proposition must be preserved 

the propoeition to be converted ia called the convertend or 
erposita and that into which it is converted the convaie 

in legitimate conversion the truth of the converse ought 
to follow from the codvertend because logical conversion 
must be iuative tha is the trdth of the convertend necessi 
tates the truth of the converse if therefore the convertend 
is true its logical converse must also be true 

illative or inferential conversion is when the truth of the 
converse may he intimated by the words therefore where

affirmed in the convertend of a part only cannot in the con

from a proposition another which does not necessarily follow 
it is said that there is no vis consequentice 

dladve conversion is of three kinds viz simple conver 
sion conversion per acddens and conversion by negation or

 — simple conversion 

simple convemon utxi atriargoii is the mere transposi 
tion of the extremes of a proposition without changing either

distributed as is the case in universal natives or neither 
of them distributed as is ibe case in particular affirmatives 
in eitber of these cases the mere transposition of the extremes 
without any alteration of the sign does not interfere with the 
quantity or the accidental quality the truth or falsehood of 
the proposition hence the only propositions which admit 
of umple conversion are universal negatives and particular 
affirmatives because in universal negatives both predicate 
and subject are universal tenns and therelbre when trtuis 
posed the nnivereal predicate of the convertend becomes a 
universal subject to the converse in particular affirmations 
again both predicate and subject are particular terms and 
as the converse does not require any terms but particulars 
they are sufficient to render it pardcular and affirmative 

of universal negatives 
the following proposition viz 
no true philosophers omit the enforcement of moral duty 

is simply convertible for since both the terms are distributed 
the proposition indicates that every true philosopher differs 
from every person who omits the enforcement of moral 
duty while on the other hand it is equally true that all 
who omit the enforcement of moral duty differ from all true 
philosophers consequently the proposition may be simply 
converted thus — 

none who omit the enforcement of moral duty are true 

philosophers 

but to take a more obvious example viz — 

it is asserted in this proposition that there is no individual 
common to the extension of both terms for no individual in 
cluded in the extension of the subject angels is included in

affirm with certainty that none of the individiials induded in 
the extension of the predicate is found among the individnals 
incladed in the ezteneion of the subject — and consequently 
the truth of the converse viz 

ko men are angels 
necessarily follows 

of particular affirmaltces 

particular affirmatives are simply convertible for since 
the extremes of the convertend are both particular which is 
the case in all particular affirmatives they retain their original 
quantity when transposed in the converse e g — 

some proud men occasionally stoop to acts of the basest 
servility 

may be simply converted thus — 

some who occasionally sloop to acts of the basest servility 
are proud men 

the truth of the simple converse of a particular affirma 
tive is proved by aldrieh as follows — if the particular affir 
mative — some blacks are civilised ia true its contradictory 
jvb blacks are civilised is false and so also is the simple 
converse of the contradictory no civilised beings are blacks 
therefore the contradictory to this viz strnie civilised beings 
are blacks is true which is the simple converse of the ori 
ginal proposition sows blacks are civilised

 the reason wby a nniveraal affirmatite cannot be con 
verted simply or into an nniverbal afflrmative is that in 
that case the predicate of the convertend would become the 
subject of the converse bnt since the predicates of nffinna 
tive propositions are particalar we would be arguing did wc 
convert such propositions simply a particulari ad univejale 
there is a class of aniyersal allirmatites however which 
may be simply converted viz reciprocal propositions in 
such propositions the predicate is an adequate definition of 
the subject aa being coextensive with it e g — 

wine is the juice of the grape 
simple converse — 

the jnioe of the grape is wine 

all triangles are figures bounded by three strtught lines 
simple converse — 

all figures bounded by three straight lines are triangles 

cicero was the discoverer of catilines conspiracy 
simple converse — 

the discoverer of catilines conspiracy was cicero 

the circumstances under which the subject and predicate 
reciprocate or change places with each other without a 
change in signification have been already explfuned 

mathematical propositions may be referred to this class 
eg— 

all ecjuilatera triangles are equiangular 
simple converse — 

all equiangular triangles are equilateral

it ia not neceesaij however to eonsider this last example 
or ita coaverse as a imiversal proposition for we are not 
speaking of all trkuigles but only of sne triangles viz 
those which ftre equilateral we may therefore reduce it to a 
partlculat affirmatite and convert it simplj as such thus — 

some triangles i e all the equilateral are all the equi 
angular

some triangles i e all the equiangular are all the equi

it may be remarked that the accidental distribution of the 
predicate in affirmative propositions should not be allowed to 
affect an argument an inference drawn from an accidental 
circumstaqce of this description would be illogical for it sup 
poses something to be known which is not made known by 
the premisses laid down the inference would be correct ut 
a material but not in a formal point of view 

universal negatives 
uoiversal negatives can be converted both simply and per 
accidens for since the simple converse of a universal nega 
tive is true the subaltern deduced from that umple converse 
is also true thus of the proposition 

no larks are webfooted birds 
the simple converse is 

ko webfooted birds are larks 
of which simple converse the subaltern is 

some webfooted birds are not larks 

and this is the coaverse per acdden of the original propo

particular negatives cannot be converted either eimply or 
per accidena for dnce the subject of a particular negative is 
not distributed the converse would require the predicate to 
be undistributed which is impossible in negative propositions 
whetiier universal or particular 

 convenion by contripontion or negation 
particular negatives it has been said cannot be converted 
either simply or per accidena in the form of particular nega 
tives yet this class of propositions may be letimately con 
verted by bbifting the sign of negation from the copula to 
the predicate and thus rendering a particular negative a par 
ticular affirmative in which form it may be simply converted 
e g the proposition 

some animals are not rational 

becomes affirmative by uniting the native particle with the 
predicate thus — 

some animals are notrational or irrational 

which may be simply converted into 

some inational beings are animals 

the application of this mode of conversion to particular 
negatives has the same effect as if the particle of negation were 
disjoined from the copula and made a part of the predicate 
and the proposition then simply converted like an affirmative 

this mode of conversion may abo be applied to universal 
affirmatives in which after transposing the terms the nega 
tive particle is combined with the new subject and the 
proposition made negative by affixing the negative particle

hayinq already treated of simple apprehension and judg

viz reasoning 

id an act of reasoning we compare two terms or concep 
tiona with some third term or conception and in this way 
adcertain whether any relation does or does not subsist 
between the two original terms or conceptions a simple 
act of reasoning of this description is termed a tyuogism 

the term syllogbm literally means a gathering or summing 
up and as used in lc it signifies a gathering of the con 
clusion from the premisses 

according to aristotle a syllogism is a speech in which 
certain things the premisses being supposed something dif 
ferent from what is supposed the conclusion follows of 
necemty and this solely in virtue of the suppositions them

aldrich defines a sjllom to be a speech in which 
certuu thidga being laid down and granted something else 
mutt follow dietjnct from but in virtue of those things which 
have been laid down and granted 

it has been shown when treating of the relative affections 
of proportions tliat one judgment maj follow from another 
but in these the terms of the new proposition are e same 
as those of the orinal proposition there from one propo 
sition another was inferred consisting of the same terms 
either in the same order as in subaltemation or in a trans 
posed order as in conversion in a syllogism however 
there must be more than one proposition either expressed or 
understood and the inference deduced although following 
immediately from the premisses must not consist of the same 
termsasanyof the propositions from which it is deduced eg — 

£ver man is fauible 

the pope is a man 

the pope is fallible 

it is plain however that the propositions forming the pre 
misses must have a necessary connection with each other 
for if thb were not the case no conclusion could follow from 
ihem e g from the propositions — 

paul was the apostle of the gentiles 
rome was mistress of the world 

no conclusion can be inferred because no connection exists 
between them whereas in fact the connection between the 
premisses and the conclusion should be such that from a 
knowledge of the former the mind should le led irresistibly 
to the latter 

the premisses whatever be their matter should be laid 
down as hypotheticallj true inasmuch as the principles from 
which the conclusion is drawn are supposed to be known and 
granted

hakcal of logic 

the coonectioq existing between the premisses and con 
clusion is termed in logic the contequence and of this there 
are two kinds viz the material and ihn formal 

the consequence is said to be material when the conclu 
sion follows from the premisses in virtne of the matter of the 
argument or the meaning necessarily attaching to the terms 

the consequence is said to he formal when the conclusion 
is inferred from the premisses in virtue of the farm of the 
eapreshon 

the formal consequence depends on the disposition of the 
terms and cannot lead into error but the material as it 
depends solely on the meaning of the terms may oftenjead 
to illogical conclusions 

every simple syllogism consists of three terms and no 
more vie the subject predicate and middle term 

every syllogism consists of three propositions viz the 
tnajor and minor premisses and the concluswa 

the major and minor propositions are by a common name 
called premisses as they precede the conclmiim 

every syllogism coosbta of two parts viz that which is 
proved and that by means of which it is proved that by 
means of which anything is proved is called the antecedent 
or premisses and that which is proved is called the inference 
or conclusion

 uamal of logic 

the propobition propoaed to be either proved or disproved 
is at first called the question to ijrouevov and when the 
ayllogiam is formed this propositioo becomes the conclusion 
hence in the phraseology of logiciaas the questiod and con 
clusion mean the same thing 

the predicate of the question is called the maor term 
puut oge and its subject the minor term ixarrut ojof but 
in relation to the middle term they are by a common name 
designated extremes 

any judgment whether affirmative or negative when ver 
bally expressed constitutes a proposition and as every pro 
position must have a subject and predicate the truth or falsity 
of the judgment enunciated by it depends on the agreement or 
disagreement of the terms representing the subject and pre 
dicate and the nature of syllogistic reasoning is to prove the 
agreement or disagreement of these terras with some third 
term with which each of them ia alternately compared in the 
premisses this tliird term is by aristotle called the middle 
term not the argument as usually stated 

the three propositions of a syllogism are called its proxi 
mate matter and as they consiat of three terms these terms 
are called its remote matter 

in every correct syllogism the middle term occurs twice in 
the premisses but never in the conclusion 

the major term occurs in the major proposition and this 
proposition may be easily discovered by observiug that pre 
miss which consists of the middle term and the predicate of 
the conclusion 

the iqiy or proposition is sometimes simply styled tae jro 
position 

the minor term occurs in the minor proposition and this 

proposition may readily be distinguished by observing that 

premiss which conusts of the middle term and the sidect 

of the conclusiod 

the minor propomtion is sometimes called the assumptiott

the dispoaitiod of tbe terms of a logism will be best 
illustrated hy an example let the question be is chris 
tianity worthy of belief t 

whatever is of divine origin is worthy of belief 
christianity is of divine origin 
chriatiaiiity is worthy of belief 

in this syuogism worthy of belief i e the predi 
catfi of the conclusion is the major term christianity its 
subject is the minor term and of divine origin is the 
middle term 

the reason why the predicate of the conclusion is called 
the major term and its subject the minor is this that the 
predicate of a universal affirmative proposition has gene 
rally a greater extension than its subject and must at least 
have as great for a universal affirmative asserts that the 
entire extension of the subject is conttuned in the extension 
of the predicate and as a syllogism in which a universal 
affirmative conclusion can be deduced is deemed the most 
perfect kind the extremes came to be invariably distinguished 
from each other by the names major and minor on account 
of what is true of them when occurring in a universal afbr 
mative conclosion 

the middle term in perfect syllogisms has a greater exten 
sion than the minor bnt not so great as the major and 
hence it has received the name of middle 

the reason why the major is called the proposition and 
the minor the assumption is that when a syllogism is in its 
most perfect form the major proposition is some generally 
admitted truth or principle and therefore not ilbely to be 
called in question and for this reason it is by way of emi 
nence sometimes called the proposition while the minor 
proposition may be objected to as boiog an atmmed truth

tion and hence the name asmmption e g —

nature is the result of intelligence 

the major proposition in this example is a general truth 
which no one will call in question but the minor viz 

nature acts with uniformity and consistency 

is not a general truth although accidentally it may he as well 
known 

it is more convenient but by no means necessary to the 
accuracy of a syllogism that the major proposition should be 
first in order in material arguments it oflen happens that 
the minor premiss is first and still more frequently that the 
conclusion begins the sentence thus — 

habitual cheerfulness is the best promoter of health for it 
checks those secret anxieties and those violent fermenu which

in every syllogism the major proposition consists of the 
major and middle terms hut whether the middle term is its 
subject or predicate depends on the figure of the syllogism 

in like manner the minor proposition in every syllogism 
consists of the minor and the middle terms but whether the 
middle term is its aulect or predicate depends also on the

rules of srixofilsm 

all the rules of bjllogism are based on the three follovjdg 
caiioua viz 

 if any two terms agree with one and the same third 
term they agree with each other 

let the question or problem be humility is worthy of 
constant cultivation the predicate worthy of constant 
cultivation agrees with a third thing viz an ordament of 
the christian character but the subject humility agrees 
with the same third therefore the extrcraes agree with each 
olher hence the following syllogism is correct — 

every oroament of the christian character is worthy of 
constant culdvatjon 

humility is an ornament of the christian character 

therefore 

humility is worthy of constant cultivation 

 if of two terms one agrees with the same third term 
and the other disagrees with it they disagree with each other 

let the question or problem be literature is not within 

the reach ef the idle the subject literature agreeswith 
a third thing viz an acquisition of real value but the pre 
dicate within reach of the idle differs from that third 

 the canons and special rclea of ajhogiam given in morrafl compondiam 
are liere adopted aldrich gives sis canons and twelve rnlea many of which

dlbbgreement of terms or concepuona in affirmative or negative propositions j

therefore the extremes disagree with oach olberj and the 
argument is thus expressed — 

acquisitions of real value are not within reach of be idle 
literature is an acquisitiod of real value 
literature is not within reach of the idle 

 two tenns of which neither agrees with the same third 
term with which they are compared may agree or disagree 
with each other 

the agreement or disagreement of any two terms can only 
be ascertained by comparing each of them alternately with 
some one third term but it may happen that no third term 
can be found with wliich to compare them so as to discover 
whether both agree with it or the one agree with it and the 
other differ from it and therefore we cannot prove whether 
they agree with or difier from each other for since no third 
term has been brought forward with which to compare them 
it is matter of doubt whether any such third term can be ad 
duced and hence their agreement or disagreement cannot 
he established until this doubt b removed 

the use of a third term in syllogistic argument is indis 
pensable for no syllogistif argument can exist unless there 
be a comparison of some two terms with a third on one or 
other of the principles contained in the first and second canons 

those two canons may be considered as axioms since they 
challenge immediate assent as soon as understood and are the 
basis on which the syllogism is founded tliey bear some 
analogy to the mathematical axioms — things which are eqnal 
to the same are equal to one another and things of which 
one is equal and the other not equal to the same are not 
equal to one another 

the validity of all affirmative conclusions depends on the 
first of these canons and the validity of all negative conclu 
sions on the second wlien the condition mentioned in the 
third canon is pnaent there can be no conclusion

these two gudoiib are closely allied to the dictum de omni 

xara frafroj and the diclhui da onllo xara ltiiiwi viz 
that whatever is affirmed or denied of a whole class may be 
affirmed or denied of whatever is comprehended in that class 
it is ftom conforming to these dicta that all syllogisms drawn 
in the first figure derive their validity for whatever can be 
predicated of a whole subject or class is neceasarily a predi 
cate of au the subjects whether particular or aingular con 
tained in that subject and on the other hand whatever 
predicate can be denied of a whole subject or class is neces 
sarily denied of all the subjects whether particular or singular 
contained under that snbject 

the rules of ayllogisra are of two kinds viz general and 
special 

the general rules apply to all syllogisms in whatever 
figures they may he drawn the special rules again have 
reference to particular figures 

the general rules are six — 

 the middle term cannot be taken twice particularly in 
the premisses but must be at least once universal i e by 
bdng the subject of a universal or the predicate of a nega 
tive proposition 

it is plain that if the middle term be tvnce particular it 
can in either premiss represent only a part of its significates 
and may therefore be taken for different parts of the same 
universal whole and then there will be in reality two middle 
terms but it is with the same third term and not with dif 
ferent parts of it that the other terms must be compared 
if then the middle term is not distributed in one or other of 
the propositions fotming the premisses the major and minor

proposition in the major proposition therefore the term 
usefiil is only compared with a part of the middle term arts 
and in the minor proposition the lerm logic may be compared

all arts are useful

we can legitimately infer the conclusion —

 the extremes cannot be taken more universally in the 
conclusion than in the premisses 

this rule may be mcve clearly understood by the explana 
tion that a term must not be distributed in the oonclusion 
which was not distributed in the premisses the object of the 
rule is to guard against inferring a universal conclusion from 
particular premisses when either the major or minor term 
is employed universally in the conclusion but particularly 
in the premisses this is termed an illicit process of the

bi this example the major trm allowable is illicitly distri

conclusion being the predicate of a negative proposition 
there are consequently two mtyor terms instead of one and 
therefore four terms in the syllogism the conclusion may 
be true notwithstanding but its truth cannot be formally in 
ferred from the premisses 

in the following example viz 

all beasts of prey are carnivorous 
all beasts of prey are animals 
all animals are carnivorous 

there is an illicit process of the minor term for ike predicate 
of the minor proposition animals is used particularly in that 
proposition but universally in the conclusion consequently 
the inference is illegitimate 

• it is evident from the two preceding rules that the num 
ber of universal terms in the premisses must be at least one 
more than in the conclusion for by the second rule eveiy 
term that is universal in the conclusion must be also universal 
in the premisses but besides this by the first rulethe

it follows that the numher of naiveraal terms in the pre 
misses cannot exceed the number in the conclusion by more 
than two for there can be but three universal terms in the 
premisses as one of them by the third rule must be affirma 
tire and to afford three one of the premisses must be nega 
tive but in this case the conclusion must be negative by the 
fifth rule and will therefore have its predicate universal 
and that the excess may be two the premisses should be e 
and a and the conclusion o or if the mood be affirmative 
the premisses must be a and a and the conclusion i in 
order to preserve the required excess 

it follows also that the greatest number of particular 
terms that can occur in the premisses are three when both 
are affirmative and one particular and then the universal 
term that occurs in the premisses must be the middle terni 
and therefore there are two particular terms in the conclusion 
¦ if there are but two particular terms in the premisses both 
are affirmative or one particular and so in either case the 
conclusion has a particular term the excess is never more 

 from two negative premisses nothing follows 

in this case a middle term is employed from which both 
extremes dififer and consequently there can be no inference 
e g—

here tlie disagreement of the extremes with the middle term

 from two afgrmative premisses a negative conclusion 
cannot follow

in this example there is an illicit process of the major 
term for while it is used particularly in the premias it is 
employed universally in the concluaon being the predicate of 
a negative proposition 

universal premisses do not always warrant a nniversol

is from a general to a specific statement and hence we infer 
an attribute to belong or not to belong to something because 
it belongs or does not belong to a class in which that thing is 
contained but in order to advance a genertd statement the

the fourth figure introduced here merely to show all the 
possible ways in which the middle term can be arranged in 
the premisses is not of aiistotelic origin it is attribated 
to galen hence called the oalenic figure on the authority 
of avemi but the words of averroes — viz et ex hoc 
planum quod jtgiira guarla de qua tneminit cfalenta non 
est tyuogitmva super quern cadet naturaltter cogitatio — are by 
no means decisive on the point aldrich truly says that this 
figure is nugatory as it proves the middle term by itself 
this we shall illustrate by the following example and analysis 
from hills notes on the compendium viz — 

all metaphysical inquiries are involved in some degree of 
obscurity 

but all things involved in obscurity are liable to error 
therefore 

some things liable to error are metaphysical inquiries 

this sytlogism predicates the medium involved in obscu 
rity of the mjor term metaphysical inquiries this ia 
predicated in tbe conclusion of die minor term things 
liable to error and this minor term is predicated in the 
minor premiss of the medium involved in obscurity — that 
is the class of things involved in obscurity is represented 
to comprehend all metaphysical inquiries the term meta 
physical inquiries is asserted to comprehend some things 
liable to error and some tilings liable to error are repre 
settd to comprehend everything that is involved in ob 
scurity thus it is implied in a circle that things involved 
in obscurity comprehend things involved in obscurity 
which is nugatory

the moods of syllogum 

the mood of a syllogisin is defined by aldiich to be legt 
tima determitmtio propositionam secundum quantitatem et 
qualitatem i e the legitimate determination of the pro 
positions with respect to quantity and quality 

when therefia the three propositions of a byllogism are 
lud down in their proper order as to their quantity and 
quality the mood of the syllogism is determined 

vicious and illegitimate moods are of course excluded from 
the class of eyllogisms to which the above definition applies 
vicious moods are designated paraliisms 

any three propositions in combination form a mood and 
as there are in all four kinds of propositions and as each of 
these four kinds may be used as ii major premiss while each 
of these major premibses admits of four different minors viz 
a e i or o there may be formed four times four or six 
teen pairs of premisses and to each of these premisses may 
be subjoined a fourfold conclnsion viz a e i or o j com 
sequently all the permutationa that can possibly be formed 
amount to sixtyfour 

of these sixtyfour varieties eleven only are found to be 
legitimate moods of syllogism consequently fiffylhree are 
excluded as tiolating some of the general rules and are there 
fore paralogisms 

these permutations are of course nothing more than an 
arithmetical calculation for the number of combinations that 
can be formed by any four things taken three and three toge 
ther ia x x 

of these sixteen viz eea eee eei eeo eoa eoe

but of these two aai and eao although conclusive are

currenue of the same armbobin difierent flgnres there are

to these three moods that only occur once viz aeo a 
oao and we have nineteen moods 

for these nineteen moods lodans iiave formed certain 
names which serve to denote the mood and figure for it has 
been shown that the same mood is used in different figures 
hence the vowels which denote the mood would not alone 
point out the fignre and they have therefore been incorpo 
rated in words which are of great use in reduction as will be 
hereafter seen 

the names are exhibited in the following lines which 
mention also the figures to which they respectively belong j —

the first figure of syllogism is considered perfect and the 
other three as imperfect although the same designations are 
given to moods under each 

the first figure is said to be perfect for two reasons — 

 it proceeds directly and immediately on the dictum de 
omni et de nuuo and it arranges the terms in the most 
natural order so as to show at once then motusl relations 

the first figure asserts in the miot proposition that an 
attribute expressed by the predicate is found in a whole class 
without exception that class being expressed by the subject of 
the proposition and states in the minor proposition that an 
otlier class or part of it expressed by the subject b contained 
within tiie former class now the predicate of the minor and 
it is therefore inferred that the subordinate class has all the 
qaalities found in the larger class to which it belongs this 
may be seen more clearly from an analysis of the following 
syllogism — 

every effect has a cause 
gravitation is an effect 
gravitation has a cause 

this syllogism exemplifies the dictum de omni the pre 
dicate cause in the major proposition is affirmed of every

which latter term is now the predicate of the minor hence 
if tbe predicate cnn be affirmed of everything represented by

the following syllogism viz — 

no man is infallible 
the pope is a man 
the fope ia not infallible 

exempufiee the sictutt de nulla the predicate infallible 
in the mfor apontion is denied of every individual con 
tained under the common term man without any excep 
tion but the singular term pope the subject of the 
minor proposition is contained in the common term man 
which latter term is now the predicate of the minor hence 
ce uie predicate inllible is denied of everything de 
noted by the common term man it may also be denied of 
any individual contained under it 

in the other figures the dictum is applied indirectly and 
partially and the relation of the terms is not ahown by their 
position the first figure therefore institutes the most ob 
vious comparison of the extremes and furnishes conclusions of 
all kinds while the other figures furnish only certain kinds 
of conclusions 

it must be remembered however that the principle of the 
first figure is imphed in all the other figures notwithstanding 
their pecaliaritiee and that it is the presence of this principle 
that warrants their reduction 

to reduce a syllogism is to bring an imperfect mood to a 
perfect i e to reduce a eyllosm drawn in any of the last 
three figures to a corresponding figure of the first by altering 
the arrangement of the premisses by this process the

amutgement of the terma is not only improved bat the com 
parison is rendered closer and the concludoa more obvioim 
aa we then can apply to each as the case may be the jdictnm 
de omni et de nuuo hence redaction is often called demon 
stration because it shows tbe validity of imperfect moods 
by bringing them to corresponding moods of the firat fignre 
which fiimish either the same conclnsions or snch as are equi 
valent by conversion 

the imperfect mood to be reduced is called the reducend 
and that to which it is reduced the reduct 

reduction is of two kinds — 

 direct or ostenaive reduction 

 indirect or reductio per imposue 

ostensive reduction consists io bringing the premisses of 
the reducend to a corresponding mood in the first figure by 
transpositioii or conversion of the premisses and from the 
premisses thus changed deducing either the original conclu 
sion or one from which it follows by conversion 

in this speoiea of conversion no new terms or propositions 
are introduced those of the reducend being either transposed 
or converted the validity of ostensive reduction depends on 
the perfection of the redact for since the reduct being a 
perfect mood of the first figure must yield a true conclusion 
it is inferred that tbe original conclusion of the redncend is 
tme because it is found to be the same with the conclusion of 
the reduct or implied in it 

indirect reduction or reductio per impossible properly so 
called consists in the following process — from one of the 
premisses of the reducend and the contradictory of its con 
clusion new premisses are formed agreeably to a correspond 
ing mood in the first figure and from these a concluuon is 
drawn contradicting the other premiss which is omitted the 
reduction is called indirect because it does not positively 
prove the original conclusion to be tme but merely shows 
that an absurdity follows ibe aupposition of its being false

tbe validity of thb process depends on the principle of 
contradictory oppoaitioa viz qtt of contradictory proposi 
tions one is always faise and the other true if therefore 
the original premisses of tlie redncend be trne as is always 
sapposed then a conclusion whioti contradicts any of tbetn 
most be ise but as that false conolnsion is dedaced from 
the new premisses one of them mnst also be ue and tbat 
most be the contradictory of ihe ornal conclusion 

this is the common process by which some imperfect 
moods are reduced but it will be fbnnd that these moods 
admit of dirct reduction by means of conversion by negation 
or contraposition thns reduction may be confined to one 
kind direct or ostensive 

in any case however all conclusions inay be proved by 
one or other of ihe two modes viz the direct or indirect 
the direct mode shows the original conclusion to be true by 
arranging the data from which it is deduced in such a way 
as to show that it results from them necessarily so that the 
mind cannot deny the truth of the conclnsion after admitting 
the troth of the premisses in ue indirect mode on the 
other hand the conclusion is assumed to be false and thus 
assumption results in some palpable absurdity showing as a 
necessary consequence that this assumption mnst bave been 
lse and hence the conclnsion which was pro forma 
aesamed to be false must in reality have been true this 
latter mode is probably the more forcible and convincing 
i in direct redaction the imperfect moods are reduced to the 
perfect by various processes of tranosition conversion or 
contraposition these processes are indicated by the principal 
consontmu in the technical words which designate the 
moods 

 the initial consonant indicates that the mood expressed 
by the word is reducible to a mood of the first figure the 
name of which commences with the same letter e g all 
moods designated by words commencing with b viz baroko

rent those with d tiz daraptt datiii duaviis dima 
ris are redacible to darti and those with f viz festino 
felapton ferimn fesapo fresuon are reducible to ferio 

 the letter m indicates that in the mood expressed b 
t name in which it occurs the premisses must be trans 
posed so that the major of the reducead becomes the minor 
in the redact and vice verm e g in reducing camestres of 
the second figure to celarent of the first m shows that the 
premisses must be transposed to give them the reqnisito 
arrangement the same process is followed in reducing 
bramantip to barbara cameneg to celarent digamu and 
dimarii to darii 

 the letters s and f show generally that in reducing the 
moods exprebsed by the names in which they occur the pro 
position designated by the vowel preceding each must be con 
verted in the redact s denotes simple conversion and p 
acddental conversion conversio per accidens e g in re 
ducing ceiare of the second figure to celarent of the first 
s shows that the major proposition e is to be converted 
simply so as t bring the predicate or middle term to the 
place of the subject as in the first figure again in reducing 
felapton of the third figare to ferio of the first the minor 
proposition a must be converted per accidens so as at once 
to become a parlicniar affirmative and bring the snlject the 
middle term to the place of tiie predicate as in the first 
figure 

 the letter k indicates that the moods undergo indirect 
reduction by contradiction or contraposition by contradiction 
when the contradictory of the conclusion is substituted for the 
premiss deeagnated by the vowel after which k is placed — 
by contraposition or conversion by negation when the 
quality of the propositions is changed so as to bring them to 
a state in which they may be directly reduced

reductio per impokible or ad absurdum 

tbia bpedes of redaction as already partially expluaed 
conuatb in the hypothetical felseliood of that which is under 
discuadon and in the tracing of such a concession to its 
legitimate consequences with the view of proving that what 
was hypothetically conceded as lse intolves some palpable 
 impobsibility or absurdity 

this kind of reduction is usually confined to the moods 
baroko of the second and bokardo of the tliird figure 
it is equally applicable however to imy of the three last 
figures as vnll be shown by examples but let us in the 
first place take baroko and bohardo 

in reference to baroko and bokardo it is naccsbary to re 
mark that the contradictory of the conclusion most be substi 
tuted for the fktrticular negative premiss while the nniversal 
premiss retains its original place in other moods redudble 
in this way the contradictory of the conclnraon must be sub 
stituted fir the major or minor premiss as the requirements 
of a syllogism in the first figure may render such subetitn 
tiod necessary

the conclusion has been legitimately deduced must also be 
false but as the major proposition is one of the original 
premisses granted to be true the fobity must be in the minor

it has been stated above that the moods in the three last

the conclusion e and the new mood will be celorent of the 
first figore hie laity involved in this assumed contradic 
tory will be best illustrated by examples of the reducend and

in this reduction the conclaaon of ihe reducend was

aud from the contradictory assumed to be true united to 
the minor premiss of the reducend a new conclusion 
was drawn but this conclusion is obviously false because it

it has been observed that in redudng the moods baroko

directly contradicts an original premiss of the reducend in 
the other moods however which may be reduced in this 
way the assumed or new conclusion will not in every

the original proposition or its simple or accidental converse 
for by the laws of conversion if a proposition is true the 
particular contained under it is true and so also b its simple

 copulative propositions 

a copnlatite proposition is one which has its subjects or

a proposition of this kind may have several subjects and 
bnt one predicate as

neither gold nor ulver will parchase immortality

when the conaecting pucle is attd the proposition is a 
copulative affirmative but when the particle is not neither 
c the proposition is a copulative negative 

a copulative affirmative is felse if any of the parts is lse 
for the truth of such a proportion depends on the truth of all 
its parts the proportion

is false if either of tiie parts is true as

in every disjunctive proposition it must be subject to the 
rules of logical division the predicates are the parts into 
which the whole subject is divided and it is therefore neces

 nothing can be inferred either om taking awa the

that the consequent follows from ihe antecedent and conse 
quently if the antecedent be true the consequent must be 
true in the latter example the consequent is denied or in 
other words is not true and hence the antecedent from 
which it follows cannot be true 

in examples like the foregoing where the major alone is 
conditional we must consider the minor as the true proposi 
tion for it is absolutely posited and the conclusion there 
fore depends for its truth on the truth of the minor 

it may be remarked that the removal of the antecedent or

proposition will not make a true syllogiam e g —

the dilemma is a conditional syllogism with adilgunctive 
antecedent or consequent it partakes both of the conditional 

and diunctive argument 

in the conditional premiss of a dilemma either the antece 
dent or consequent may be disjunctive 

a dilemma may prove either an affirmative or negative 
conclusion 

when an affirmative is proved the dilemma is said to be 
in the modus ponens ¦ when a negative is proved it is siud to

when in the modus tollens dettruclive a dilemitia is said 
to be simple vhen it concludes categorically and complex 
ybtai its conclusion is diunctive 

a dilemma is an argument hj which we endeavour to 
prove the absurdity or felsebood of some asserdon with 
thb view a conditional proposition is assumed the antece 
deut of which is the assertion to be disproved white ibe con 
sequent is a diigunctive proposilion enumerating all tbe 
possible suppositions upon which the assertion contained in 
the antecedent can be tme should all the euppoaitions con 
tuned in tbe consequent be rejected it must follow that the 
antecedent must also be rejected if therefore a proposition 
of which the antecedent is conditional and the consequent 
disjunctive be tbe major of a syllogism and if the minor 
deny all the suppositions enumerated in the consequent it 
will follow necessarily that the conclusion must deny the 
antecedent 

in the strictest form of the dilemma it is supposed that 
some one of the antecedents must be true or some one of the 
conbequenta false but without determining which of them is 
 the name dilemma also refers to the circumstance that 
the mor in sladng the ailment presents two suppoeitions 
or cases from each or both of which the same conclusion may 
be drawn 

certain kinds of dilemmas require as will be seen from the 
following examples that the denial of each branch of the 
consequent must be proved in tbe minor by a prosyllogism 
eg— 

if there are two independent first principles the one good 
and the other evij either the one is more powerful than the 
other or they are equal in power 

but the one is not more powerful than the other for if it 

it were it would entirely prevent the other from having any

share in the production or govemmedt of the universe and 
therefore ereiything would be eitlierbbsoiutelj good or abso 
lutely evil neither are they equal in power j for if they were 
but had opposite wills they would counterbalanoe each other 
and therefore produce nothing 

therefore there are not two independent first principles 
the one good and the other evil 

in this dilemma the antecedent is the assertion to be dis 
proved by remotjon all the suppositions enumerated in the 
disjunctive part of the major on which the antecedent could 
be tenable are removed in the minor by means of proofs pro 
syllogisticall attached and as a necessary consequence the 
conclusion rejects the antecedent 

this dilemma may be reduced to the two following condi 
tional syllogisms — 

 if there are two independent first principles the one 
more powerful than the other everything would either be 
absolutely good or absolutely evil 

but the present is not the case of everything being either 
absolutely good or absolutely evil 

therefore there cannot be two independent first principles 
the one more powerful than the other 

 if there are two independent first principles equal in 
power but of opposite wills they must counterbalance each 
other and produce nothing 

but the present is not the case of nothing being produced 
therefore there are not two independent first prindples 
equal in power but of oppodte wills 

the following example is of a simpler character —

among uncivilised communities

virtue inclining rather to expediency than rectitude neither 
can it exist among unciyilised communities for the actions 
of savages are regulated by narrow belfishness which is in

therefore perfect virtue does not exist 

the simple comtructive dilemma has a major premiss con 
ttuning several antecedents with one common consequent 
and a minor which grants these antecedents disjunctively 
i e grants some one of them e g — 

if the heavenly inhabitants have either no desires or have 
these fully gratified they are perfectiy happy 

but they either have no desires or have them fully 
gratified 

therefore they are perfectly happy 

if a chrimian be living he is the lords servant and if he 
be dead he is the lords servant 

but he must be always either living or dead 

therefore he is always the lords servant 

in a constructive dilemma some one of the antecedents is 
assumed to be true and in a destructive some one of the 
consequents is assumed to be false but which is left unde 
termined 

the complex comtructive dilemma has a mjor premiss 
containing several antecedents each with a different conse 
quent and a minor which grants the antecedents difgunc 
tively while the condusion infers the consequents disjunc 
tively i e determines one of them to be tnie e g — 

if the evangelists speak truth christianity is of god and 
if they do not speak truth the ezistnce of christianity is

fouowing example viz —

should plead a cause beibre the judges and gain it prota 
goras found him a rery apt scholar but after he had made 
good progress he was in no haste to dead causes the 
master conceiving that he intended by these means to shift 
off his second payment took as he thought a sure method of 
getting the better of his delay he sued euathlus before the 
judges and having opened his cause at the bar he pleaded 
to this purpose — o most foolish yonng man do you not see 
that in any event i must gain my point for if the judges 
gve sentence for me you must pay by their sentence if 
nst me the condition of our agreement is fulfilled and 
you have no plea left for your delay after having pleaded and 
gained a cause to which euathlus answered o most 
wise master i might have avoided the force of your argu 
ment by not pleading my own cause but giving up this 
advantage do yon not see that whatever sentence the judges 
pass lam safet if they give sentence for me i am acquitted 
by their sentence if against me the condition of our ree 
ment is not fulfilled by my pleading a ciuise and losing it 

the dilemma as used by protagoras may be thus stated — ¦ 

bither the canse will go on my side or on yours 

if the cause goes on my side you must pay me according 
to the sentence of the judge if the cause goes on your side 
yon must pay me according to your bargain

an enthymeme in its proper signification may be as com 
plete in its expresbioa as any other kind of syllogism for it 
merely differs from the syllogism in this that its conclusion 
depends on sigjis and likelihoodi its province is mainly 
probable reasoning and therefore treats reasoning as applied 
to a particular kind ef matter it does not proceed npon 
axioms like the syllfsm the matter of the mjor pre

probabilities not on axioma and the term ratroi iq this ap 
plication may bo explained bj naming it the place where 
middle terms are found but since enthyroemes derive their 
force only from cumulation there is nothing gained from 
reducing them to syllogistic form 

the foregoing is a brief statement of tbe nature of the 
aristotelian eothymeme and is merely given to guard the 
learner against a prevalent though erroneous notion the 
common view however whether the result of misapprehension 
or of idtentional innovation has been too long countenanced 
by almost all writers on logic to be readily rejected it is a 
qaestjon indeed how far the rejection of the common view is 
desirable if we consider bow much it conduces to logical 
expertness in ordinary argumentation syllogisms invari 
ably occur in an abbreviated form for the entire statement of 
premisses and conclusion would appear pedantic and artifidal 
and in connection with the word enthymeme iu ils ordinary 
acceptation it may not be out of place to lay before the learner 
the rules by which he may ascertain the particular figure in 
which any enthymeme may be drawn 

an enthymeme as commonly defined is an irregular syllo 
gism in which one of the premisses is suppressed or as it 
might be more properly defined — an argument in the form in

which it would naturauy occur in thought or speech it coq 
aequenuy consists of only the expressed premisb and the con 
clusion these are designated the antecedent and consequent 
the latter being the conclusion of the syllogism and the 
former either the mjor or minor premiss 

although the enthymeme as ordinarily nnderstood is a 
defective syllogism consisting of only one premiss and the 
conclnsion it always implies a syllogism and expresaeg ita 
terms 

if the syllogism implied in an enthymeme be a simple one 
it will be easy to discover which of the premisses lias been 
suppressed by observing which of the extremes occurs in it 
because one or other of the extremes must occur in each pre 
miss and from this we ascertain which of the premisses the 
antecedent is and how the syllogism is to te completed 

one of the terms viz one of the extremes of the question 
always occars twice and when this term is the subject of the 
consequent the major premies is buppressed but if the term 
twice occurring be the predicate of the consequent the minor 
premiss b suppressed the suppressed premiss is supplied 
by comparing with the middle term the extreme which occurs 
only once 

in the greater dumber of enthymemes the minor is ex 
pressed as being more particularly related to the question to 
be proved and also as being more likely to he called in ques 
tion than the mqjor tlie major as already stated is usually

here three things are to he noted 

 lat it is only in the first and second figores that tle 
minor proposition and conclusion can liave a common subject 

 that if the minor is negative the enthymeme is not 
drawn in the first figure 

 that if the conclusion is affirmative the enthymeme is

in the fouowing enthymeme viz — ¦ 

isaiah was a true prophet therefore 

isaiah was inspired 
the antecedent and consequent haye a common subject viz 
 isaiah the other terms are prophet the predicate of the 
antecedent and inspired the predicate of the conaequent 
but since a syllogism can only have three teims and as the 
middle term does not appear in the conclusion the term 
 prophet must be the middle term and by comparing it dw 
tributed with the major term inspired we supply the sup 
pressed premise and have a jruogism in barbara of the first 
figure thus

ia drawn in the second figure the consequent and the ante

other terms being truly satisfactory and unattended with 
remorse which latter term must be the middle as it does not 
appear in the conclusion and by comparing it with the major 
twin truly satisctory we supply the suppressed premiss 
and have a compet syllogism in camostres of the second 
figure thus 

whatever is truly satisfactory is unattended with retofse 
no guilty pleasures are unattended with remorse 
no guilty pleasures are truly satisfeclory 

rule ii 

when the antecedent and consequent have a common pre 
dicate the enthymeme is drawn either in the first or third 
figure and the minor is suppressed 

it must be noted here — 

 that it is only in the first and third figures that the 
major proposition and conclusion can have acommon predicate 

 that if the conclusion is universal the enthymeme is not 
drawn id the third figure 

in the following example viz — 

nothing difiicult of attainment is within reach of the indo 
lent therefore useful knowledge is not within reach of the 
indolent 

the antecedent and consequent have a common predicate viz 
 vrithin reach of the iudolent and as the only other term 
which does not appear in the concluraon is nothing difficult of 
attainment this must be the middle term and by comparing 
it with the subject of the conclusion viz useful knowledge

some ancient poets must have been ignorant of the effects pro

is in the third figure and by comparing the subject of the

all who believe in dreams must be ignorant of the efiecta

some who believed in dreams were ancient poets 

some ancient poets must have been ignorant of the effects 
produced by external objects on the body in sleep 

when the subject of the antecedent is the predicate of the

fourth figure and the minor is suppressed 

it must be observed here — 

that it is only in the second and fourth figures that the 
subject of the major proposition can be the predicate of the

is virtue how do our feelings of moral approbation arise t 
dr brown states that virtue is a relation and that relations 
do not eiist in the objects but in the mind that contemplates 
them — that there is no virtue in actions — nothing that is in 
one action which does not exist in another to excite the 
emotion of moral approbation — that virtue is a felt relation to 
certain emotions and nothing more — that the mind might have 
been formed capable of approving what it now disapproves 
and in this case vice would not only seem virtue but would 
reall be virtue as both depend on the arbitrary constitution 
of the mind 
mr paynes refutation maybe epicheirematically stated thus — 

whatever theory maintains that virtue has no character of 
itself but depends on the arbitrary constitution of the mind 
must be false for it supplies us with no adequate cause for 
the rise of the emotion of approbation for it proceeds on a 
practical forgetfuluess of the distidction which exists between 
what u and what ought to be for it implies that the most 
flagitious actions may upon a change of opinion not only 
lose all their turpitude but become positively virtuous for it 
implies that we do not approve of an action because it is 
right but that the action becomes right because we approve 
of it 

bat dr browns theory mtuntains that virtue has no cha 
racter of ilsek but depends on the arbitrary constitution of 
the mind therefore 

dr browns theory muat be false 

the prosyllogistic proo may be stated in separate syllo 
ems thus — 

every theory on virtue that supplies ns with no adequate 
cause for the rise of the emotion of moral approbation must 
be false

one of the best and most frequently quoted examples is

of nature and of nations and the conduct of good men proye

but clodius attempted to assassinate another for he 
formed an ambuscade against him and provided himself with 
armed soldiers therefore 

clodius was justly killed by the object of his murderous

utmost importance for it is the mind which directs all our 
actions 

logic is a study whiut regulates the conduct of the mind 
for it is wholly emplted about its operations therefore 

logic is a study of the utmost importance 

this form of reasoning is often employed efficaciously but 
every superduoua proof should be omitted in many exam 
ples the proof of the minor is of little use yet whenever 
the auxiliary propositions are employed to strengthen either 
the agreement or repugnancy of the extremes in the con

the true force of the ailment in a sorites is to be de 
duced not om the resolution of it into aylloms but from 
the codfiideration that something is universally affirmed or 
denied in the last premiss of a term in which the preoeding 
premisses show that the first subject is contained and there 
fore in the conclusion the same is legitimately ajflrmed or 
denied of tlie first subject in the same quantity which it has 
ia the first premiss 

it has been stated above that in expanding a sorites into 
separate syllogisms the first in the series has for its major 
premiss the second proposition in the sorites and the first 
proposition for its minor this transposition is required in 
order that the separate syllogisms may be in the first figure 
and consequently brought under the dictum which applies to 
that figure thus all the syllogisms will be in the first figure 
and all except the last will be in the moods aaa or aai in 
the latter if the first premiss of the sorites be particular on 
examining the two first propoeitions in the foregoing sorites 
it will be seen that the middle term is the predicate of the 
mor and the subject of the minor hence were a conclusion 
to be drawn without a transposition of the premisses the 
syllogism would be in bramantip of the fourth figure thus —

it has also been stated that in the second syllogism of an 
expanded sorites the major premiss is the third proposition in 
the series and the minor the conclusion of the first separate 
yllism and it may be mentioned in explanation of this 
that as the two first propositions in the sorites have been made 
nee of in the first separat syllogism iu drawing the second 
syllogism the third proposition in the sorites used as a major 
premiss with the conclusion of the first separate syllogism 
used as a minor will give a conclusion in barbara of the fist 
figure the process consequently to be followed in expand 
ing a sorites into separate syllogisms is to berin with trans 
posing the two first propositions in the sontical series in 
order to give the middle term its proper place in the premisses 
of a syllogism drawn in the first figure and in the second 
to use the third proposition in he sorites as a major with the 
conclusion of the first separate syllogism as a minor this 
latter process is equally necessary as the first in order to 
bring all the separate syllogisms under the principles which 
regulate the first figure 

with reference to a categorical sorites such as given above 
it may be remarked — 

 that no proposition of a sorites except the last can bo 
negative 

 that no proposition of a sorites can be particular ex 
cept the first and 

 that if the first proposition be particular the conclusion 
must be particular 

in explanation of the first of these rules viz that no pro 
position except the last can be negative it may be stated 
tiist when a sorites is expanded into separate syllosms the 
last syuogism can alone admit of a negative premiss and con

elusion for bidce the middle term is the subject of the mor 
proposition the syllogiam must be either of the first or third 
figure and consequently bj the special rulea applicable to 
these figures the minor must he affirmative but the minor 
of each successive syllogism is the conclusion of that preced 
ing ami by being affirmative proves that the premisses firom 
which it was deduced were also afiirmative the last pre 
miss of the sorites therefore viz the last intermediate propo 
sition is the only one that can be negative because the last 
premiss alone never gives occasion to employ the conclusion 
of the last expanded syllogism as the minor of a subsequent 
one for should any other premiss of the sorites but ile last 
be negative it would lead to a negative conclusion and that 
conclusion being made the minor of the following syllogism 
would violate the special rules of the first which does not 
admit of a negative minor premiss 

in explanation of the second of the foregoing rules viz 
that no proposition of a sorites can be particular except the • 
first it may be stated that sinco in expanding a sorites into 
separate syllogisms of the first figure it is necessary to trans 
pose the two first premisses for this transposition gives a 
mor with a universal subject and in all syllogisms of the 
first figure the major must be universal for if this were uot 
the case the middle term would be taken twice particularly 
hence all the intermediate premisses of a sorites must serve 
as premisaea to universal conclusions 

in explanation of the third rule viz that if the first propo 
sitioa be particnlar the conclusion must be particular it may 
be stated that since the subject of the first proposition in a 
sorites is also the subject of the conclusion and since no term 
can be need more universally in the conclusion than in the 
premisses the subject of the conclusioa must be particular 
and consequently the conclusion itself these condiuons 
apply of course only to the categorical sorites

the case for tbe conclusion does not infer the certainty of any 
fact occurring in the same manner as the individual fact or

or sophisms 

sophisms are of two lunds — verbal and material in the 
former the follacy is in the diction in the latter the flacy 
inrks in the objectmatter in the language of the schools 
these were termed fallacies in dictione and extra dictionem 
corresponding with the aristotelic division viz oj iraja n 
jv and hi ifv rf hiiut 

fallacies in the expression are necessarily and essentially 
connected with language fallacies in the matter on the 
other hand are related to language only in a secondary or 
accidental sense 

fallacies have been defined to be decepdve or apparent 
arguments by which a man is himself convinced or endeavours 
to convince others of something which is not really proved 

aristotle enumerates thirteen different kinds of fallacies 
of these six are said to be tn dictione or in the expression 
and seven extra dietionem or in the matter this eanmera 
tion is not given as exhaustive of all the possible species of 
faoacies but rather as a catalogue of the forms under which 
fiiuaciea most generally present themselves in dialectics or

 murder is certainly not a proper middle term to contain 
the minor term murderer 

projectors are unfit to be trusted

who frames a theory must be a theorist the two terms 
though derived from the same root cannot be conddered as 
equivalent expressions for the meaning commonly attached

the following ia one of the instances commonly quoted

raw meat b bought in the market therefore 

baw meat ie eaten 

in the rnor premiss the middle term bought in the 
market must be understood simfjy as to its substance while 
in the minor it is used as connected with circumstances and 
accidents hence there are four terms in the foqowiitg 
example there are also four terms — 

we are forbidden to kill 

ttsing capital punishment is killing 

we are forbidden to use capittd punishment 

in this example it ii plain that the middle term kill ia 
the major proposition must be understood as referring to the 
divine commaiid prohibiting violence agst human life and 
that the violence is consequently of a private nature in the 
minor on the other hand the middle must be understood in a 
public oijudidai sense and that circamstauces are attached 
to it which make it a middle term altogether difint from 
that used in the major yet in the eoncluon the inference is 
isely drawn from the one to the other

the term induction yrceyuyyi inductio has been variously 
expluned by some it has been understood to mean the in 
ducing or influeucing c£fect the nature of the reasoning im 
plied in the inductive process has on the mind of a hearer 
others have explained it as a hringing in as an inference of 
the question to be proved while a third class have held it to 
signify a collection cff accumulation of instances to constitute 
an antecedent or premiaa from which to infer a required 
conclusion 

the last view is the correct one for whatever diverdtj of 
opinion may prevail regarding the exact nature of the induc 
tive inference in one point all must agree that in the induc 
tive argument the inference is from the particular to the tini 
versal — in other words from tite aggregate of individuals to 
the universal whole constituted by them 

but to pass om the name to the thing ugniged by it 
three conflicting views of the proper function of induction 
present themselves — 

 the objective process of investigating partieular fects as 
preparatory to illation or inference 

to this it is otgected by those who adopt the formal defi 
nition of logic that induction in so br as it is a logical pro 
cess at all and it is only logical in so r as it is formal is 
equally formal with syllogism though proceeding in the in

terse order and it la objected farther that as the iavesti 
gation of particular tacts is purely an inventive process it i 
beyond the bounds of a critical science and cannot be ad 
mitted within the province of logic 

 a material illation or inference of the universal om 
the singular warranted either by the general analogies of 
nature or by epecial presumptions afforded by the object 
matter of any real science 

to thia view the formal school also olgeot on the ground 
that tbe consequence is not logical for the inference is effected 
vi materia in virtue of the matter — that is on gronnda not 
implied in the motion of its antecedent 

 a formal illation or inference of tbe universal from the 
invidual as legitimated solely by the lawa of thought and 
abstracted from the conditions of any particular matter 

this is the formal view according to which an inference 
strictly logical in its diaracter whether inductive or deduc 
tive is determined ratioite forma by reason of the form of 
the argument which signifies that the conclusion is neces 
sarily implied in the very conception of tbe premisses for 
logic rectises no inference that is not necessitated by the 
laws of thought and it must therefore be presumed that the 
induction is perfect i e that tbe individuals mentioued are 
in reality the whole constituents of tbe species before the 
inductive inference can come in any way within the province 
of tbe logician 

to extend the province of logic to tbe selecting and testing 
of instances would require a broader definition for tiie in 
ductive process than for tbe deductive a complete enu 
meration of instances or of the members of a class will con 
stitute a foundation for a valid inductive inference but the 
completeness is the result of a material not of a logical inquiry 
the baconian induction from being more scientific and scru 
tinising has superseded tbe ancient induction per enumera

are equally absolute and detennine all formal or iccal in 
ference whatever transcends or violates either of them 
transcends or violates loc it would not be less illegitimate 
to infer by the deductive syllogism an attribute belonging to 
the whole of something it was not conceived to contain as 
a parl tfian by llie inductive to condnde of the wkole what 
is not conceived as a predicate of all ils constituent parts 
logical inference is thus only of two kinds it must proceed 
either from the whole to the parts or from the parts to the 
whole and it is only under the character of a constituted or 
contaaning whole or of a congtitntiag or ccmttuned part that 
anything can become the term of a logiral argnmenlauod 

as processes of reasoning deduction and induction are 
equally essential they are so related indeed that the one 
requires the ouier deduction is only possible through in 
duction the chief value of the latler consists in realising 
the possibility of the former our knowledge commences 
wilb the apprehension of cdngulars and it is upon the know 
ledge thus acquired that every universal whole whatevct its 
nature may be is founded deductive reasoning is conse 
quently not an original process in the indnctive mode 
logic by synthetic illation ascends to its wholes and in the 
deductive illalaon redescends from whole to parts

lukual of loolc 

but the two processes are not aimilar the one is the 
eonnterpart of the other their analogies and difierences 
can be best exemplified hj employing the same effmbok in au 
ascent through an indactive sjuogism and a redeecent 
ijirough a dednctite 

inductiw syliogitm 
x t z are a 

x y z are whole b therefore 
bis a 

in this example x i is the middle term and bg 
the bntfject of both premisses the lltsm b apparently in 
the third figore but it is only in appearance for in the de 
dactdve process the conclusion is invariably particalar in syllo 
giams drawn in the third figore whereas in the example 
above given the conclosion is universal bat a qiiivrasal con 
clneion is not valid in the third fignre for since the minor of 
a syllogism in the third figure must be affirmative its predi 
cate must be pardcular and since this predicate must be 
tbe butgect of the conclusion the conclusion must itself be 
particular 

to say therefore on the standard of the deductive that 
the inductive efyllogiam ia in the tliird figure is a mistake 
and tbe mistake arises from the ambignity of the copula or 
substantive verb which in different relations expresses dther 
are contain under or cotutitufe this may be illustrated 
by aristotles example viz — 

man horse mule are longlived 

man horse mule are the whole class of animals wanting 
bill therefore 

the whole class of animals wanting bill are longlived 

here it is evident that the subject man horse mule 
stands in a very different relation to its predicate in the 
mjor and in the minor premiss though in botii cases the 
connection is expressed by the same copula in the major 



hygoogle 



 makual of logic 

the copnla are expressea lliat tbe predicate determinee the 
subject as a contained part in the minor that the bnhject 
determines the predicate by conhituting it a whole thus — 

longlived containt man horse mnle 

man horse mnle comtiiuu wiimal wanting bill therefore 

lodglived codtaiiui animal wanting hiu 

on comparing aribtotieb example with the statement of 
it immediately preceding the distinctions between it and the 
lloms drawn in the third figure are as follows — that 
in the minra premiss of the indnctite eyllogism the mthject 
instead of being contataed under the predicate in reality 
comtitutei it and that in virtue of this distinction a 
nniversal conclusion is logically drawn in this form which is 
illegitimate in the third flgore of syllogism 

the above syllogism when put in the deductive fonn will 
stand thns — 

deductive 
bis a 

x y z are under b therefbre 
x t z are a 

in the propodtiona of both the inductive and deductive 
syllogisms the order of the terms remuns unchanged but 
the order of the propositions themselves are reversed for 
the conclusion of the inductive syllogism forms the miyor 
premiss of the deductive of the terms the nugor a is com 
mon to both but the middle term x t z of the inductive 
syllosm is the minor of flie deductive the minor premiss 
is common to both syllogisms but its meaning when em 
ployed in the deductive llogm is different m its mean 
ing in the inductive in the indactive the parts i e the 
subjects x y z bdng conceived as constituting the mhou 
are the dstermining notion while in the dednctive the same 
parta being conceived as eoblained under the whole are the 
determined notion

siune tiindamental principle applies equally to any instancea 
that might have been adduced the inventive process by

of the most valuable occupations in wfaich the human mind
