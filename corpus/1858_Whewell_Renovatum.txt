it is to our immortal countryman bacon that we owe tti 
brdfid announcement of tis grand and fertile principle and the 
developement of the idea that the whole of natural philosophy 
consists entirely of a series of inductive generalizations com 
mencing with the most circumstantially stated particulars and 
carried up to universl laws or axioms which comprehend in 
their staten fnts every subordinate degree of generality and of 
a corresponding series of inverted reasoning from generals to 
particulars by which these axioifls are traced back into their 
remotest consequences and all particular propositions deduced 
frofli them as well those by whose immediate considerations 
rose to their discovery as those of which we had no previpus 
knowledge

preface 


even if bacon’s novum organonlnsa possessm the 
character to which it aspired as completely as was 
possible in its own day it woulc at present need r etio 
lation and even if no such book had ever been writ 
ten it would be a worthy undertaking to determine 
the machinery intellectual social and material by 
which human knowledge can best be jfugmented 
bacon could only divine jiow sciences might be con 
structed we can trace in their history how their 
construction has taken place however sagacious wsre 
his conjectures the facts which have really occurred 
must give additional instruction however large wre 
his anticipations the actual progress of science since 
his time has illustrated them in all their extent and 
as to £he structure and operation of the organ by 
which truth is to be collected from nature — that is 
the methods by which science is to b promoted — we 
know that though bacon’s general maxims are saga 
cious and animating his particular precepts failed in 
his hands and are now practically useless this 
perhaps was not wonderful seeing that they were as 
i have said mainly derived from conjectures respect 
ing knowledge and the progress ot knowledge but at

preface 


the present day rw lien in several provinces of know 
ledge we have a large actual progress of solid truth 
to look jack upon we nlay make the like attempt 
with the prospect of better success at least on that 
ground t f may be a task not hopeless to ‘extract 
from the past progress of science the elements of an 
effectual and substantial method of scientific disco 
very the advances which have during tlie last three 
centuries been made in tlie physical sciences — hi 
astronomy in physics in chemistry in natural his 
tory in physiology — these are allowed by all to bo 
real to be great to be striking may it not be that 
the steps of progress in these different cases have in 
them something alike mgy it not be that in each 
advancing movement of such knowledge there is some 
qommon principle some common process may it 
not be that discoveries are made by an organ which 
has something uniform in its working if we caft 
slvw that this is so we sha have the new organ 
which bacon aspired to construct renovated according 
to our advanced intellectual position and office 

it was with the view of opening the way to such 
an attempt that i undertook that survey of he past 
progress of physical knowledge of which i have given 
the results in the history of the sciences and the 
iftory of scientific ideas the former containing 
the history of the sciences so far as it depends on

observed facts the latter containing the history of 
those ideas by which such facts are bound into 
theories 

it can hardly happen that a work fvhich treats of 
methods of scientific discovery shall not seem to 
fail in the positive results which i offers for an 
art of discovery is not possible • at elch stejj of the 
investigation are needed invention sagacity gsnius 
elements which no art can give we may hope in 
vain as bacon hoped for an organ which shall enatole 
all men to construct scientific truths as a pair of 
compasses enables all men to construct exact circles 
this cannot be the practical results of the philoso 
phy of science must be rather classification and 
analysis of what lias been done than precept and 
method for future doing yet i think that the me 
thods of discovery which i have to recommend thougi 
gathered from a wider survey of scientific history 
both as to subjects and as to time than so far as i am 
aware has been elsewhere attempted are quite as 
definite and practical as any others which have been 
proposed with the great additional advantage of being 
the methods by which all gixmt discoveries in science 
have really been made this may be said for instance 
of the method of gradation and tlie method of natural 
classification spoken of b iii c viii and in a nar 
rower sense of the method of curves the method of

means the method of least squares and the method 
of residues spoken of in chap vii of the same book 
also the n iremarks on the use of hypotheses and on 
the tests of hypotheses b ii c v point out features 
which mark the usual course of discovery 

but one of the principal lessons resulting from our 
views i undoubtedly this — that different sciences 
may be expected to advance by different modes of 
procedure according to their present condition aul 
that in many of these sciences an induction performed 
by any of the methods which have just been referred 
to is not the next step which we may expect to see 
made several of the sciences may not be in a condi 
tion which fits them for such a colligation of facts 
to use tlie phraseology to which the succeeding ana 
lysis has led me the facts may at the present 
time require to be more fully observed or the idea 
by which they are to be colligated may require to bo 
more fully unfolded 

but in this point also our speculations are far from 
being barren of practical results the examination 
to which we have subjected each science gives us the 
means of discerning whether what is needed jbr the 
further progress of the science has its place in the 
observations or in the ideas or in the union of the 
two if observations be wanted the methods of ob 
servation given in b iii c ii may be referred to if 
those who are to make the next discoveries need for 
that purpose a developement of their ideas the modes 
in which such a developement has usually taken

place are treated of in chapters iij and iv of that 
book 

no one who has well studied the history science 
can fail to see how important a partof that history 
is the explication or as i might call it the clarifica 
tion of men’s ideas this the metaphysical aspect of 
each of the physical sciences is very far froip being 
as some htfve tried to teach an aspect which it passes 
trough at an early period of progress and previously 
to the stage of positive knowledge on the contrary 
the metaphysical movement is a necessary part of the 
inductive movement tltfs which is evidently so by 
the nature of the case was proved by a copious collec 
tion of historical evidences in the history scientific 
tdeas the ten books of that history contain an 
account of the principal philosophical controversies 
which have taken place in all the physical sciences 
tfrpjn mathematics to physiology these controversies 
which must be called metaphysical if anything be so 
called have been conducted by the greatest discoverers 
in each science and have been an essential part of the 
discoveries made physical discoverers have differed 
from barren speculators not by having no metaphysics 
in their heads but by having good metaphysics in 
their heads while their adversaries had bad and by 
binding their metaphysics to their physics instead of 
keeping the two asunder i trust that the history of 
scientific ideas is of some value even as a record of a 
number of remarkable controversies but conceive 
that it also contains an indisputable proof ihat there

preface 


is in progressive science a metaphysical as well as a 
physical element — ideas as well as facts — thoughts 
as well things metaphysics is the process of as 
certaining thafyth ought is consistent with itself and 
if it be net so our supposed knowledge is not know 
ledge 

in chapter vi of the second book i have spoken of 
the logic of induction several writers h ive quoted 
very emphatically my assertion that the logic of ind 
tion does not exist in previous writers using it as an 
introduction to logical schemes of their own they 
seem to have overlooked thq fact that at the same time 
that i noted the deficiency i offered a scheme which i 
think fitted to supply this want and i am obliged to 
say that i do not regard the schemes proposed by an 
of those gentlemen as at all satisfactory for the purpose 
but i must defer to a future occasion any criticism of 
authors who have written on the subjects here treated 

a critical notice of such authors formed the twelfth 

 

book of the former edition of the philosophy of the 
sciences i have there examined the opinions concern 
ing the nature of beal knowledge and the inode of 
acquiring it which haven been promulgated in all ages 
from plato and aristotle to boger bacon to francis 
bacon to newton to herschel such a survey with 
the additions which i should now have to make to it 
may hereafter be put forth as a separate book but i

have endeavoured to confine the present volume to such 
positive teaching regarding knowledge and science as 
results from the investigations pursued iithe other 
works of this series but with regard to this matter 
of the plogic of induction i may venture to say that 
we shall not find anything desenpng the name ex 
plained in the common writers on logfc or exhibited 
under the ordinary logical forms § that in previous 
writers which comes the nearest to the notice of such a 
logic as the history of science has suggested and veri 
fied is the striking declaration of bacon in two of his 
aphorisms b i aph civ cv 

“ there will be good hopes for the sciences then 
and not till then when by a true scaleor ladder 
and by successive steps following continuously without 
gaps or breaks men shall ascend from particulars to 
the narrower propositions from those to intermediate 
ones rising in order one above another and at last to 
the most general 

“ but in establishing such propositions we jnust de 
vise some other form of induction than has hitherto 
been in use and this must be one which serves not 
only prove and discover principles as very general 
propositions are called but also the narrower and the 
intermediate and in short all tnie propositions” 

and he elsewhere speaks of successive floors of 
induction 

all the truths of an extensive science form a series 
of such floors connected by such scales or ladders 
and a part of the logic of induction consists as i 



x 


preface 


conceive in the construction of a scheme of such 
floors converging from a wide basis of various 
classes of particulars at last to one or a few general 
truths these schemes necessarily take the shape of 
a pyramid i have constructed such pyramids for 
astronomy and fqr optics and the illustrious yon 
humboldt in speaking of the former subject does me 
the honour to say that my attempt in thut depart 
ment s perfectly successful the logic of induction 
contains other portions which may be seen in the 
following work b ii c vi 

i have made large additions to the present edition 
especially in what regards the application of science 
b iii c ix and the language of science the 
former subject i am aware that i have treated very 
imperfectly it would indeed of itself furnish mate 
rial ifor a large work and would require an acquaint 
ance with practical arts and manufactures of the mast 
exact and extensive kind but even a general ob 
server may see how much more close the union of art 
with science is now than it ever was before and what 
large and animating hopes this union inspires both 
for the progress of art end of science on another 
subject also i might have dilated to a great extent 
— what i may call as i have just now called it the 
social machinery for the advancement of science there 
can be no doubt that at certain stages of sciences

dividing the offices of observer and generaiizer we 
have had in europe in general and especially in this 
country very encouraging examples ofwhatmy be 
‘done by syich associations for tjie present i have 
jply ventured to propound one aphorism on the sub

sidering whether a continued and connected system of 
observation and calculation like that of astronomy 
might not be employed in improving our knowledge 
of other subjects as tides currents winds clouds 
rain terrestrial magnetism aurora borealis compo 
sition of crystals and the like in saying this i have 
mentioned those subjects which are as appears fo 
•me most likely to profit by continued and connected 
observations 

i have thrown the substance of my results into 
aphorisms as bacon had done in his novum or 
jjanunt this i have done not in the way of deliver 
ing dogmatic assertions or oracular sentences for 
the aphorisms are all supported by reasoning and 
were in fact written after thd reasoning and ex 
tracted from it i have adopted this mode of gather 
ing results into compact sentences because it seems to 
convey lessons with additional clearness and emphasis

novum organon renovatu 


the name organon as applied to the works of 
aristotle which treated of logic that is of the method 
of establishing and proving knowledge and of refuting 
errour by means of syllogisms francis bacon hold 
ing that tills method was insufficient and ftftile for 
the augmentation of real and useful knowledge pub 
lished his novum organwi in which he proposed for 
that purpose methods from which he promised a better 
success since his time real and useful knowledge has 
made great progress and many sciences have beem 
greatly extended or newly constructed so that even 
if bacon’s method had been the right one and had 
been coftiplete as far as the progress of science up to 
his time could direct it there would be room for the 
revision and improvement of the methods of arriving 
at scientific knowledge 

inasmuch as we have gone through the histories 
of the principal sciences from the earliest up to the 
present time in a previous work and have also traced 
the history of scientific ideas in another work it 
may perhaps be regarded as not too presumptuous if 
we attempt this revision and improvement of the 
methods by which sciences must rise and grow this 

— 



 novum organon renovatum 

is our task in tli present volume and to mark tlie 
reference of this undertaking to the work of bacon we 
name our jbook novum organon renovatum 

bacon has delivered his precepts in aphorisms 
some of them stated nakedly others expanded into 
dissertation the general results at which we have 
anryed by tracing the history of scientific ideas are 
the groundwork of such precepts as we have to give 
and i shall theefore begin by summing up these 
results in aphorisms referring to the former wrk 
fof the historical proqf that these aphorisms are true

aphorisms 


y 

fact and theory correspond to sense on the one hand 
and to ideas on the other so far as we are conscious of our 
ideas hut all facts involve ideas unconsciously and thus 
the distinction of facts and theories is not tenable as that 
of sense andjdeas is i 

vi 

senscttions and ideas in our knowledge are like matter 
and form in bodies matter cannot exist without form 
nor form without matter yet the two are altogether cvs 
tinpt and opposite there is no possibility either of separat 
ing or of confounding them the same is the case with 
sensations and ideas i 

yii 

ideas ane not tran s formed but informed sensations for 
ivithout ideas sensations have no form i 

ylii 

the sensations are the objective the ideas the subjec 
tive part of every act of perception or knowledge i 

ix 

general terms denote ideal conceptions as a circle an 
orbit a rose these are not images of real things as was 
held by the realists but conceptions yet they are concep 
tions not bound together by mere name as the nominalists 
held but by an idea i 

x

axiom — that causes v are measured by their effects — gives 
rise to the second law of motion — that when a force acts 
upon a body in motion the effect of the force is com

axiom — that reaction is equal and opposite to action — 
gives rise to the third law of motion which is expressed

the above laws of motion historically speaking were 
established by means of experiment but since they have been 
discovered and reduced to their simplest forrn they have been 
considered by many philosophers as selfevident this result 
is principally due to the introduction and establishment of 
terms and definitions which enable us to express the laws in 
a very simple manner hi 

liy 

jfi the establishment of the laws of motion it happened 
in several instances that principles were assumed as self 
evident which do not now appear evident but which have 
since been demonstrated from the simplest and most evident 
principles thus it was assumed that a perpetual motion 
is impossible — that the velocities of bodies acquired by 
falling down planes or curves of the same vertical height 
are equal — that the actual descent of the center of gra 
vity is equal to its potential ascent but we are not hence 
to suppose that these assumptions were made without ground 
for since they really follow from the laws of motion they 
vfere probably in the minds of the discoverers the results of 
undeveloped demonstrations which their sagacity led them 
divine in 

ly 

it is ct paradox that experience should lead us to truths 
confessedly universal and apparency necessary such as the 
la ws of motion are the solution of this paradox is 
that these laws are interpretations of the axioms of causa

the right interpretation of the terms which they involve is 
learnt by experience our idea of cause supplies the form

former works we have treated of tlie history of scientific 
discoveries and of the history of scientific ideas we 
have now to attempt to describe the manner in which 
discoveries are made and in which ideas give rise to 
knowledge it has already been stated that knowledge 
requires us to possess both facts and ideas — that 
every step in our knowledge consists in applying the 
ideas and conceptions furnished by our minds to the 
facts which observation and experiment offer to us 
when our conceptions are clear and distinct when our 
facts are certain and sufficiently numerous and when 
the conceptions being suited to the nature of the

facts aie applied to them so as to produce an exact 
and univrsal accordance we attain knowledge of a 
precise aim comprehensive kind which we may term 
science d we appl this term to our knowledge 
still more decidedly when facts being thus included 
in exact and general propositions such propositions 
are in tlfse same manner included with equal rigour 
iji propositions of a higher degree of generality and 
tlise again in others of a still wider nature so as to 
form a large and systematic whole 

but after thus stating in a general waip the nature 
of science and the elements of which it consists we 
kave been examining with a more close and extensive 
scrutiny some of those elements and we must now 
return to our main subject and apply to it the results 
of our long investigation we have been exploring 
the realm of ideas we have been passing in review 
the difficulties in which the workings of our own minds 
involve us when we would make our conceptions con 
sistent with themselves and we have endeavoured to 
get a sight of the true solutions of these difficulties 
we have now to inquire how the results of these long 
and laborious efforts of thought find their due pjacet in 
the formation of our knowledge what do we gain 
by £liese attempts to make our notions distinct and 
consistent and in what manner is the gain of which 
we thus become possessed carried to the general trea 
surehouse of our permanent and indestructible know 
ledge after all this battling in the world of ideas 
all this struggling with the shadowy and changing 
forms of intellectual perplexity how do we secure to 
ourselves the fruits of our warfare and assure ourselves 
that we have really pushed forwards the frontier of 
the empire of science it is by such an appropria 
tion that the task which we have had in our hands 
during the two previous works the history of the 
inductive sciences and the history of scientific ideas 
must apiire its real value and true place in our design 

in order to do this we must reconsider in a more 
definite and precise shape the doctrine which has 
already been laid down — that our knowledge consists 



two processes etc q 

in applying ideas to facts and tfiat tie conditions of 
real knowledge are that the ideas be distinc and ap

facts the steps by which ouf knowledges aclf anced 
are those by which one or the other of these two pro 
cesses is rendered more complete — by which concep 
tions are made more clear in themselves or y which 
the conceptions more strictly bind together the factor 
these two processes may be considered as together con 
stituting the whole formation of our knowledge and 
the principles which have been established in the his

of these two operations — upon the business of elevating 
our conceptions to the highest possible point of pre 
cision and generality but these two portions of the 
progress of knowledge are so clearly connected with 
each other that we shall deal with them in immediate 
succession and having now to consider these opera

before possible to do we shall designate them by cer 
tain constant and technical phrases we shall speak 
of the two processes by which we arrive at science as 
the explication of conceptions and the colligation of 
facts we shall show how the discussions in which we 
have been engaged have been necessary in order to 
promote the former of these offices and we shall 
endeavour to point out modes maxims and principles

chapter ii 

op the explication of conceptions 


aphorism ii 

the explication of conceptions as requisite for the pro 
gress of science has been effected by means of discussiom and 
controversies among scientists often by debates concerning 
definitions these controversies have frequently led to the 
establishment of a definition but along with the definition 
a corresponding proposition has always been expressed or 
implied the essential requisite for the advance of science 
is the clearness of the conception not the establishment of a 
definition the construction of an exact definition is often 
very difficult the requisite conditions of clear conceptions 
may often be expressed by axoms as well as by definitions 

aphorism iii 

conceptions for purposes of science must be appropriate 
as well as clear that is they must be modifications of that 
fundamental idea by which the phenomena can really be in 
terpreted this maxim may warn us from err our though 
it may not lead to discovery discovery depends upon the 
previous cultivation or natural clearness of the appropriate 
idea and therefore no discovery is the work of accident 

sect i — historical progress of the explication of 
conceptions 

i ttte have given the appellation of ideas to ccr 
v v tain comprehensive forms of thought — as 
space number cause composition resemblance — which 
we apply to the phenomena which we contemplate 
but the special modifications of these ideas which are

exemplified in particular facts we have tewned con 
ceptions as a circle a square number an opcelerating 
force a neutral combination of element a genus 
such conceptions involve in themselves certain neces 
sary and universal relations derived from the ideas 
just enumerated and these relations are an indispen 
sable portion of the texture of our knowledge but to 
determine the contents and limits of this portion £ 
our knowledge requires an examination of the ideas 
and conceptions from which it proceeds the con 
ceptions musj be as it were carefully unfolded so as 
to bring into clear view the elements of truth with 
which they are marked from their ideal origin thft 
is one of file processes by which our knowledge is ex 
tended and made more exact and this i shall describe 
as the explication of conceptions 

in the several books of the history of ideas we 
have discussed a great many of the fundamental ideas 
of the most important existing sciences we have in 
those books abundant exemplifications of the process 
now under our consideration we shall here add a 
few general remarks suggested by the survey which 
wt have thus made 

 such discussions as those in which we have been 
engaged concerning our fundamental ideas have beer 
 the course by which historically speaking those con 
ceptions which the existing sciences involve have been 
rendered so clear as to be fit elements of exact know 
ledge thus the disputes concerning the various kinds 
and measures of force were an important part of the 
progress of the science of mechanics the struggles by 
which philosophers attained a right general conception 
of plane of circular of elliptical folarization vere 
some of the most difficult steps in the modern discove 
ries of optics a conception of the atomic constitu 
tion of bodies such as shall include what we know 
and assume nothing more is even now a matter of 
conflict among chemists the debates by wlfich in 
recent times the conceptions of fyjecies and genera 
have befoi rendered more exact have improved the 
science of botany the imperfection of th science of 



 


construction of science 


mineralogy arises in a great measure from the circum 
stance that in that subject the conception of a species 
is not yet ixed in physiology what a vast advance 
would that philosopher inake who should establish a 
precise tenable and consistent conception of life 

thus discussions and speculations concerning the 
import of eery abstract and general terms and notions 
may be and in reality have been far from useless and 
ban on such discussions arose from the desire of men 
to impress their opinions on others but they had the 
effect of making the opinions much more clear and dis 
tinct in trying to make others understand them they 
learnt to understand themselves their speculations 
were begun in twilight and ended in the fulllbrilliance 
of day it was not easily and at once without expen 
diture of labour or time that men arrived at those 
notions which now form the elements of our know 
ledge on the contrary we have in the history of 
science seen how hard discoverers and the forerunners 
of discoverers have had to struggle with the indistinct 
ness and obscurity of the intellect before they could 
advance to the critical point at which truth became 
clearly visible and so long as in this advance some 
speculators were more forward than others there was 
r natural and inevitable ground of difference of opi 
nion of argumentation of wrangling but the ten 
dency of all such controversy is to diffuse truth and to 
dispel errour truth is consistent and can bear the 
tug of war errour is incoherent and falls to pieces 
in the struggle tnie conceptions can endure the 
sun and become clearer as a fuller light is obtained 
confused and inconsistent notions vanish like visionary 
spectres at the break of a brighter day and thus 
all the controversies concerning such conceptions as 
science involves have ever ended in the establishment 
of the side on which the truth was found 

 indeed so complete has been the victory of 
truth in most of these instances that at present we 
can hardly imagine the struggle to have been neces 
sary the very essence of these triumphs is that they 
lead us to tegard the views we reject as not only false 



explication of conceptions 


 


but inconceivable and hence we are ledrather to 
look back upon the vanquished with contempt than 
upon the victors with gratitude we now cesyise those 
who in the copernican controversy could not conceive 
the apparent motion of the sun on the heliocentric 
hypothesis f — or those who in opposition to galileo 
thought that a uniform force might be tfiat which 
generated a velocity proportional to the space — ar 
those who held there was something absurd in new 
ton’s doctrine of the different refrangijjility of differ 
ently coloured rays — or those who imagined that 
when elements combine their sensible qualities must 
be manifest in the compound — or those who were 
reluctant to give up the distinction of vegetables into 
herbs shrubs and trees we cannot help thinking that 
men must have been singularly dull of comprehension 
to find a difficulty in admitting what is to us so plain 
and simple we have a latent persuasion that we in 
their place should have been wiser and more clear 
sighted — that we should have taken the right side 
and given our assent at onc to the truth 

 yet in reality such a persuasion is a mere delu 
sion jclie persons who in such instances as the above 
were on the losing side were very far in most cases 
from being persons more prejudiced or stupid or nar 
rowminded than the greater part of mankind now 
are and the cause for which they fought was far 
from being a manifestly bad one till it had been so 
decided by the result of the war it is the peculiar 
character of scientific contests hiat what is only an 
epigram with regard to other warfare is a truth in 
this — they who are defeated are reiflly in the wrong 
but they may nevertheless be men of great subtilty 
sagacity and genius and we nourish a very foolish 
selfcomplacency when we suppose that we are their 
superiors that this is so is proved by recollecting 
that many of those wlo have made very great disco 
veries have laboured under the imperfection of tliought 
which was the obstacle to the next step in knowledge 
though kepler detected with great acuteness the 
numerical laws of the solar system he laboured in 
nov org

vain to conceive the very simplest of the laws of 
motion b which the paths of the planets are governed 
though prrestley made spme important steps in chemis 
try he coul not bring his mind to admit the doctrine 
of a general principle of oxidation how many in 
genious men in the last century rejected the new

false but as inconceivable the doctrine of luminife 
rous undulations to err in this way isrtlie lot not 
only of men in general but of men of great endow 
ments and very sincere love of truth 

 and those who liberate themselves from such 
perplexities and who thus go on in advance of their 
age in such matters owe their superiority in no small 
degree to such discussions and controversies as those 
to which we now refer in such controversies the 
conceptions in question are turned in all directions 
examined on all sides the strength and the weakness 
of the maxims which men apply to them are fully test 
ed the light of the brightest minds is diffused to other 
minds inconsistency is unfolded into selfcontradic 
tion axioms are built up into a system of necessary 
truths and ready exemplifications are accumulated of 
that which is to be proved or disproved concerning 
the ideas which are the basis of the controversy 

the history of mechanics from the time of kepler 
to that of lagrange is perhaps the best exemplifica 
tion of the mode in which the progress of a science 
depends upon such disputes and speculations as give 
clearness and geiperality to its elementary conceptions 
this it is to be recollected is the kind of progress of 
which we are now speaking and this is the principal 
feature in the portion of scientific history which we 
have mentioned kor almost all that was to be done 
by reference to observation was executed by galileo 
and his disciples what remained was the task of 
generalization and simplification and this was pro 
moted in no small degree by the various controversies 
which took place within that period concerning me 



explication of conceptions 


 


clianical conceptions — as for example the question 
concerning the measure of the force of percussion — 
the war of the vis viva — the controversy of the cen 
ter of oscillation — of the independence of statics and 
dynamics — of the principle of least action — of the 
evidence of the laws of motion — and of the humber 
of laws really distinct none of these discussions was 
without its influence in giving generality and clearness 
to the mechanical ideas of mathematicians and there 
fore though remote from general apjfrehension and 
dealing with very abstract notions they were of emi 
nent use in the perfecting the science of mechanics 
similar controversies concerning fundamental notions 
those for example which galileo himself had to main 
tain were no less useful in the formation of the science 
ofjhydrostatics and the like struggles and conflicts 
whether they take the form of controversies between 
several persons or only operate in the efforts and fluc 
tuations of the discoverer’s mind are always requisite 
before the conceptions acquire that clearness which 
makes them fit to appear id the enunciation of scien 
tific truth this then was one object of the history 
of idea — to bring under the reader’s notice the main 
elements of the controversies which have thus had so 
important a share in the formation of the existing 
body of science and the decisions on the controverted 
points to which the mature examination of the subject 
has led rfinl thus to give an abundant exhibition of 
that step which we term the explication of conceptions 

sect ii — use of definitions 

c the result of such controversies as we have 
been speaking of often appears to be summed up in a 
definition and the controversy itself has often as 
sumed the form of a battle of definitions for ex 
ample the inquiry concerning the laws of falling 
bodies led to the question whether tlie proper defi 
nition of a uni for in force is that it generates a velocity 
proportional to the space from rest or to the time 
the controversy of the vis viva was what was the 
 



 construction of science 

proper definition of the measure of force a principal 
question the classification of minerals is what is 
the definition of a mineral species physiologists have 
endeavoured to throw light on their subject by de 
fining organization or some similar term 

 itis very important for us to observe that 
these controversies have never been questions of insu 
lated and arbitrary definitions as men seem often 
tempted to suppose them to have been in all cases 
there is a taciff assumption of some proposition which 
is to be expressed by means of the diifinitio and 
¦which gives it its importance the dispute concerning 
the definition thus acquires a real value and becomes 
a question concerning true and false thus in the dis 
cussion of the question what is a uniform force it 
was taken for granted that ‘ gravity is a uniform 
force — in the debate of the vis vim it was assumed 
that f in the mutual action of bodies the whole effect 
of the force is unchanged — in the zoological definition 
of species that it consists of individuals which have 
or may have sprung from clie same parents it is pre 
sumed that ‘ individuals so related resemble each other 
more than those which are excluded by such a defi 
nition’ or perhaps that e species so defined have per 
manent and definite differences a definition of or 
ganization or of any other term which was not em 
ployed to express some principle would be of no value 

the establishment therefore of a right definition 
of a term may be p useful step in the explication of 
our conceptions but this will be the care then only 
when we have under our consideration some propo 
sition in which the term is employed for then the 
question really is how the conception shall be under 
stood and defined in order that the proposition may be 
true 

 the establishment of a proposition requires an 
attention to observed facts and can never be rightly 
derived from our conceptions alone we must here 
after consider the necessity which exists that the facts 
should be rightly bound together as well as that our 
conceptions should be clearly employed in order to 



explication of conceptions 


 


lead us to real knowledge but ve my observe here 
that in such cases at least as we are now considering 
the two processes are coordinate to unfold our con 
ceptions by the means of definitions has nearer been 
serviceable to science except when it has been asso 
ciated withan immediate use of the definitions the 
endeavour to define a uniform force was •combined 
with the assertion that ‘ gravity is a uniform force 
the attempt to define accelerating force was imme 
diately followed by the doctrine that c accelerating 
forces may be compounded’ the process of defining 
morrfcntum was connected with the principle that 
‘ momenta gained and lost are equal naturalists would 
have given in vain the definition of species which we 
have quoted if they had not also given the ‘ characters’ 
of species so separated definition and proposition 
are the two handles of the instrument by which we 
apprehend truth the former is of no use without the 
latter definition may be the best mode of explaining 
our conception but that which alone makes it worth 
while to explain it in any mode is the opportunity of 
using it in the expression of truth when a defi 
nition is propounded to us as a useful step in know 
ledge we are always entitled to ask what principle it 
serves to enunciate if there be no answer to this in 

 quiry we define and give clearness to our conceptions 
in vain while we labour at such a task we do but 
light up a vacant room — we sharpen a knife with 
which we have nothing to cut — we take exact aim 
while we load our artillery with blank cartridge — 
we apply strict rules of grammar to sentences which 
have no meaning 

if on the other hand we have under our considera 
tion a proposition probably established every step 
which we can make in giving distinctness and exact 
ness to the terms which this proposition involves is 
an important step towards scientific truth in such 
cases any improvement in our definition is a real 
advance in the explication of our • conception the 
clearness of our expressions casts a light upon the 
ideas which we contemplate and convey to others 



 


construction of science 


 but the ugh definition may be subservient to a 
right explication of our conceptions it is not essential 
to that process it is absolutely necessary to every 
advance in our knowledge that those by whom such 
advances are made should possess clearly the concep 
tions which they employ but it is by no means neces 
sary tliatithey should unfold these conceptions in the 
words of a formal definition it is easily seen by 
examining the course of galileo’s discoveries that he 
had a distinct conception of the moving force which 
urges bodies downwards upon an inclined plane while 
he still hesitated whether to call it momentum energy 
impetus or force and did not venture to offer a defi 
nition of the thing which was the subject of his 
thoughts the conception of polarization was clear 
in the minds of many optical speculators from the 
time of iiuyghens and newton to that of young and 
fresnel this conception we have defined to be op 
posite properties depending upon opposite positions’ 
but this notion was by the discoverers though con 
stantly assumed and expressed by means of superfluous 
hypotheses never clothed m definite language and 
in the mean time it was the custom among subordi 
nate writers on the same subjects to say that the 
term polarization had no definite meaning and was 
merely an expression of our ignorance the definition 
which was offered by haliy and others of a mineral lo 
gical species — ‘the same elements combined in the 
same proportions with the same fundamentaf form ’ — 
was false inasmuch ps it was incapable of being rigor 
ously applied to any one case but this defect did not 
prevent the philosophers who propounded such a defi 
nition from making many valuable additions to mine 
ralogical knowledge in the way of identifying some 
species and distinguishing others the right concep 
tion which they possessed in their minds jrevented 
their being misled by their own very erroneous defi 
nition the want of any precisd definitions of strata 
and formations rnd epochs among geologists has 
not prevented the discussions which they have carried 
on upon such subjects from being highly serviceable 



explication of conceptions 


 


in the promotion of geological knowledge for how 
ever much the apparent vagueness of these terms 
might leave their arguments open to cavil there was a 
general understanding prevalent among the most in 
telligent cultivators of the science as to what was 
meant in lcli expressions and this common under 
standing sufficed to determine what evidence should 
he considered conclusive and what inconclusive in 
these inquiries and thus the distinctness of con 
ception which is a real requisite of scientific progress 
existed in the minds of the inquirers although defi 
nitions which are a partial and accidental evidence 
of this distinctness had not yet been hit upon the 
idea had been developed in mens minds although a 
clothing of words had not been contrived for it nor 
perhaps the necessity of such a vehicle felt and thus 
that essential condition of the progress of knowledge 
of which we are here speaking existed while it was 
left to the succeeding speculators to put this unwritten 
rule in the form of a verbal statute 

to men are often prone to consider it as a thought 
less omission of an essential circumstance and as a 
neglect which involves some blame when knowledge 
thus assumes a form in which definitions or rather 
conceptions are implied but are not expressed but 
such a judgment they assume that to be a matter of 
choice requiring attention only which is in fact as 
difficult and precarious as any other portion of the task 
of discovery to define so that our definition shall 
have any scientific value requires no small portion of 
that sagadlty by which truth is detected as we have 
already said definitions and propositions are coordi 
nate in their use and in their origin in many cases 
perhaps in most the proposition which contains a 
scientific truth is apprehended with confidence but 
with some vagueness and vacillation before it is put in 
a positive distinct and definite form it is thus known 
to be true before it edn be enunciated in term each of 
which is rigorously defined the •business of defini 
tion is part of the business of discovery when it has 
been clearly seen what ought to be our definition it 



 


construction of science 


must be pretty well known what truth we have to 
state the definition as well as the discovery sup 
poses a decided step in our knowledge to have been 
made the writers on logic in the middle ages made 
definition the last stage in the progress of knowledge 
and in this arrangement at least the history of science 
and the philosophy derived from the history confirm 
their speculative views if the explication of our 
conceptions ever assume the form of a definition this 
will come to pass not as an arbitrary process or as a 
matter of course but as the mark of one of those happy 
efforts of sagacity to which all the successive advances 
of our knowledge are owing 


sect iii — use of axioms 

 our conceptions then even when they become 
so cleai as the progress of knowledge requires are not 
adequately expressed or necessarily expressed at all by 
means of definitions we may ask then whether there 
is any other vnode of expression in which we may look 
for the evidence and exposition of that peculiar exact 
ness of thought which the formation of science demands 
and in answer to this inquiry we may refer to the 
discussions respecting many of the fundamental ideas 
of the sciences contained in our history of such ideas 
it has there been seen that these ideas involve many 
elementary truths w hich enter into the texture of our 
knowledge introducing into it connexions and relations 
of the most important kind although these elementary 
truths cannot be deduced from any verbal definition of 
the idea it has been seen that these elementary truths 
may often be enunciated by means of axioms stated in 
addition to or in preference to definitions for exam 
ple the idea of cause which forms the basis of the 
science of mechanics makes its appearance in our elemen 
tary mechanical reasonings not as a definition but by 
means of the axioms that causes are measured by 
their effects and that reaction is equal and opposite 
to action’ such axioms tacitly assumed or occa 



explication of conceptions 


 

sionally stated as maxims of acknowfedged validity 
belong to all the ideas which form the foundations of 
the sciences and are constantly employed in the reason 
ing and speculations of thosb who think clearly on 
such subjects it may often be a task of some diffi 
culty to defect and enunciate in words the principles 
which are thus perhaps silently and unconsciously 
taken for granted by those who have a share in the 
establishment of scientific truth but inasmuch as 
these principles are an essential element in our know 
ledge it is t very important to our present purpose 
to separate them from the associated materials and 
to trace them to their origin this accordingly 
attempted to do with regard to a considerable num 
ber of the most prominent of such ideas in the his 
tory the reader will there find many of these ideas 
resolved into axioms and principles by means of 
which their effect upon the elementary reasonings of 
the various sciences may be expressed that work 
is intended to form in some measure a representation 
of the ideal side of our physical knowledge — a table 
of those contents of our conceptions which are not 
received directly from facts — an exhibition of rules 
to which we know that truth must conform 


sect iv — clear and appropriate ideas 

 ri order however that we may see the neces 
sary cogency of these rules we mist possess clearly and 
steadily the ideas from which the rules flow in order 
to perceive the necessary relations of the circles of the 
sphere we must possess clearly the idea of solid 
space — in order that w may see the demonstration of 
the composition of forces we must have the idea of 
cause moulded into a distinct conception of statical 
force this is that clearness of ideas which we stipu 
late for in any one’s mind as the first essential con 
dition of his making any new step in the discovery of 
truth and we now see wdiat answer we are able to 
give if we are asked for a criterion of this clearness of 



 


construction of science 


idea tlie criterion is that the person shall see the 
necessity of the axioms belonging to each idea — shall 
accept them in such a manner as to perceive the cogency 
of the reasonings founded upon them thus a person 
has a clear idea of space who follows the reasonings of 
geometry and fully apprehends their con elusiveness 
the explication of conceptions which we are speaking 
of as an essential part of real knowledge is the process 
by which we bring the clearness of our ideas to bear 
upon the formation of our knowledge and this is 
done as we have now seen not always nor generally 
nor principally by laying down a definition ot the 
conception but by acquiring such a possession of it 
in our minds as enables indeed compels us to admit 
along with the conception all the axioms and prin 
ciples which it necessarily implies and by which it 
produces its effect upon our reasonings 

 but in order that we may make any real advance 
in the vliscovery of truth our ideas must not only be 
clear they must also be appropriate each science has 
for its basis a different class of ideas and the steps 
which constitute the progress of one science can never 
be made by employing the ideas of another kind of 
science no genuine advance could ever be obtained 
ip mechanics by applying to the subject the ideas of 
spa and time merely — no advance in chemistry by 
the use of mere mechanical conceptions no discovery 
in physiology by referring facts to mere chemical and 
mechanical principles mechanics must involve the 
conception of force — chemistry the conception of 
elementary composition — physiology the conception 
of vital powers each science must advance by means 
of its appropriate conceptions each has its own field 
which extends as far as its principles can be applied i 
have already noted the separation of several of these 
fields by the divisions of the books of the history of ideas 
the mechanical the secondary mechanical the che 
mical the classificatory the biological sciences form so 
many great provinces in the kingdom of knowledge 
each in a great measure possessing its own peculiar 
fundamental principles every attempt to build up a 



explication of conceptions 

new science by the application of principles which be 
long to an old one will lead to frivolous and barren 
speculations 

this truth has been exemplified in all the instances 
in which subtle speculative men have failed in their 
attempts tg frame new sciences and especially in the 
essays of the ancient schools of philosophy greece 
as has already been stated in the history of science 
aristotle and his followers endeavoured in vain to 
account for the mechanical relation of forces in the 
lever by applying the inappropriate geometrical con 
ceptions of the properties of the circle — they specu 
lated to no purpose about the elementary composition 
of bodies because they assumed the inappropriate 
conception of likeness between the elements and the 
compound instead of the genuine notion of elements 
merely determining the qualities of the compound and 
in like manner in modern times we have seen in the 
history of the fundamental ideas of the physiological 
sciences how all the inappropriate mechanical and 
chemical and other ideas which were applied in succes 
sion to the subject faileef in bringing into view any 
genuine physiological truth 

 that the real cause of the failure in the in 
stances above mentioned lay in the conceptions js 
plain it was not ignorance of the facts which in 
these cases prevented the discovery of the truth aristotle 
was as well acquainted with the fact of the proportion 
of the weights which balance on a lever as archimedes 
was although archimedes aloie gave the true me 
chanical reason for the proportion 

with regard to the doctrine of tjie four elements 
indeed the inapplicability of the conception of compo 
sition of qualities required perhaps to be proved by 
some reference to facts but this conception was 
devised at first and accepted by succeeding times in a 
blind and gratuitous manner which could hardly have 
happened if men had been awake to the necessary 
condition of our knowledge — that the conceptions 
which we introduce into our doctrines are not arbitrary 
or accidental notions but certain peculiar modes of 



 


construction of science 


apprehension strictly determined by the subject of our 
speculations 

 it may however be said that this injunction 
that we are to employ appropriate conceptions only in 
the formation of our knowledge cannot be of practical 
use because we can only determine what ideas are 
appropriate by finding that they truly combine the 
facts and this is to a certain extent true scientific 
discovery must ever depend upon some happy thought 
of which we cannot trace the origin — some fortunate 
cast of intellect rising above all rules no maxims 
can be given which inevitably lead to discovery no 
precepts will elevate a man of ordinary endowments 
to the level of a man of genius nor will an inquirer 
of truly inventive mind need to come to the teacher 
of inductive philosophy to learn how to exercise the 
faculties which nature has given him such persons 
as kepler or fresnel or brewster will have their 
powers of discovering truth little augmented by any 
injunctions respecting distinct and appropriate ideas 
and such men may very naturally question the utility 
of rules altogether 

 but yet the opinions which such persons my 
entertain will not lead us to doubt concerning the 
value of the attempts to analyse and methodize the 
process of discovery who would attend to kepler if 
lie had maintained that the speculations of francis 
bacon were worthless notwithstanding what has 
been said we may venture to assert that the maxim 
which points out tha necessity of ideas appropriate 
as well as clear for the purpose of discovering truth is 
not without its us§ it may at least have a value as 
a caution or prohibition and may thus turn us a why 
from labours certain to be fruitless we have already 
seen in the history of ideas that this maxim if duly 
attended to would have at once condemned as wrongly 
directed the speculations of physiologists of the mathe 
matical h mechanical chemical and vitalfluid schools 
since the ideas which the teachers of these schools in 
troduce cannot suffice for the purposes of physiology 
which seeks truths respecting the vital powers again 



explication of conceptions 


 


it is clear from similar considerations that no definition 
of a mineralogical species by chemical characters alone 
can answer the end of scienge since we seejj to make 
mineralogy not an analytical butaclassificatory science 
even before the appropriate conception is matured in 
men’s minds so that they see clearly what it is they 
may still have light enough to see what it is not 

 another result of this view of tfie necessity 
of appropriate ideas combined with a survey of the 
history of science is that though for te most part as 
we thall sec the progress of science consists in accu 
mulating and combining facts rather than in debating 
concerning definitions there are still certain peridfls 
when the discussion of definitions may be the most 
useful mode of cultivating some special branch of 
science this discussion is of course always to be con 
ducted by the light of facts and as has already been 
said along with the settlement of every good defi 
nition will occur the corresponding establishment of 
some proposition but still at particular periods the 
want of a definition or of the clear conceptions which 
definition supposes may be peculiarly felt a good 
ahd tenable definition of species in mineralogy would 
at present be perhaps the most important step which 
the science could make a just conception o£ the 
nature of life and if expressed by means of a defini 
tion so much the better can hardly fail to give its 
possessor an immense advantage in the speculations 
which now come under the considerations of physio 
logists and controversies respecting definitions in 
these cases and such as these may be very far from 
idle and unprofitable 

thus the knowledge that clear and appropriate 
ideas are requisite for discovery although it does not 
lead to any very precise precepts or supersede the 
value of natural sagacity and inventiveness may still 

 this agrees with what m neckcr science jiave substituted the analysis 
has well observed in his llcgne of substances for the classification of 
mineral that those who have treat individuals see history of ideas

be of use to us in our pursuit after truth it may 
show us what course of research is in each stage of 
science recommended bv the general analogy of the 
history of knowledge and it may both save us from 
hopeless and barren paths of speculation and make us 
advance with more courage and confidence to know 
that we are looking for discoveries in the manner in 
which theyhave always hitherto been made 

sect y — accidental discoveries 

• 

 another consequence follows from the views 
presented in this chapter and it is the last i shall at 
present mention no scientific discovery can with any 
justice be considered due to accident in whatever 
manner facts may be presented to the notice of a disco 
verer they can never become the materials of exact 
knowledge except they find his mind already provided 
with precise and suitable conceptions by which they may 
be analysed and connected indeed as we have already 
seen facts cannot be observed as facts except in virtue 
of the conceptions which the observer himself uncon 
sciously supplies and they are not facts of observa 
tion for any purpose of discovery except these familiar 
and unconscious acts of thought be themselves of a 
just and precise kind but supposing the facts to be 
adequately observed they can never be combined into 
any new truth except by means of some new concep 
tions clear and appropriate such as i have endeavoured 
to characterize when the observer’s mind is pre 
pared with such instruments a very few facts or it 
may be a single one may bring the process of disco 
very into action but in such cases this previous 
condition of the intellect and not the single fact is 
really the main and peculiar cause of the success the 
fact is merely the occasion by which the engine of 
discovery is brought into play sooner or later it is 
as i have elsewhere said only the spark which dis 
charges a gun already loaded and pointed and thero

explication of conceptions 


 

is little propriety in speaking of such an accident as 
the cause why the bullet hits the mark if it were 
true that the fall of an apple was the occasion of new 
ton’ pursuing the train of tkought which led to the 
doctrine of universal gravitation the habits and con 
stitution of ewton’s intellect and not the apgle were 
the real source of this great event in the jflrogress of 
knowledge the common love of the marvellous and 
the vulgar desire to bring down the greatest achieve 
ments of genius to our own level in fry lead men to 
ascribe such results to any casual circumstances which 
accompany them but no one who fairly considers the 
real nature of great discoveries nd the intellectuifl 
processes which they involve can seriously hold the 
opinion of their being the effect of accident 

 such accidents never happen to common men 
thousands of men even of the most inquiring and 
speculative men had seen bodies fall but who except 
newton ever followed the accident to such •conse 
quences and in fact how little of his train of 
thought was contained in or even directly suggested 
by the fall of the apple if the apple fall said the 
discoverer ‘why should not the moon the planets the 
satellites fall’ but how much previous thought — 
what a steady conception of the universality ofthc 
laws of motion gathered from other sources — were 
requisite that the inquirer should see any connexion 
in these gases was it by accident that he saw in the 
apple an image of the moon and of every body in the 
solar system 

 tle same observations may be made with re 
gard to the other cases which are sometimes adduced 
as examples of accidental discovery it has been said 

‘ by the accidental placing of a rhomb of calcareous 
spar upon a book or line bartholinus discovered the 
property of the double refraction of light’ but bar 
tholinus could have seen no such consequence in the 
accident if he had not previously had a clear concep 
tion of single refraction a lady in describing an 
optical experiment which had been shown her said of 
her teacher ‘he told me to increase and diminish 



 construction of science 

the angle of refraction and at last i found that he only 
meant me to move my head up and down’ at any 
rate till the lady had acquired the notions which the 
technical terms convey she could not have made 
bartholinus’s discovery by means of his accident ‘by 
accidentally combining two rhombs in different posi 
tions it is acfcled ‘ huyghens discovered the polari 
zation of light supposing that this experiment hd 
been made without design what huyghens really 
observed was that the images appeared and disap 
peared alternately as he turned one of the rhombs 
round but was it an easy or an obvious business to 
analyze this curious alternation into the circumstances 
of the rays of light having sides as newton expressed 
it and into the additional hypotheses which are im 
plied in the term ‘polarization’ those will be able 
to answer this question who have found how far from 
easy it is to understand clearly what is meant by 
‘polarization’ in this case now that the property is 
fully established huygliens’s success depended on his 
clearness of thought for this enabled him to perform 
the intellectual analysis which never would have occur 
red to most men however often they had ‘ accidentally 
combined two rhombs in different positions ‘ by acci 
dentally looking through a prism of the same sub 
stance and turning it round malus discovered the 
polarization of light by reflection’ malus saw that 
in some positions of the prism the light reflected 
from the windows of the louvre thus seen through 
the prism became dijn a common man would have 
supposed this dimness the result of accident but 
malus’s mind wds differently constituted and disci 
plined he considered the position of the window 
and of the prism repeated the experiment over and 
over and in virtue of the eminently distinct concep 
tions of space which he possessed resolved the pheno 
mena into its geometrical conditions a believer in 
accideiffc would not have sougfit them a person of 
less clear ideas would not have found them a person 
must have a strange confidence in the virtue of chance 
and the worthlessness of intellect who can say that 



explication op conceptions 

 in all these fundamental discoveries appropriate ideas 
had no share’ and that the discoveries ‘ might have 
been made by the most ordinary observers’ m 

 i have now i trust shown in various ways 
how the explication of conceptions including in this 
term their ’clear development from fundamental ideas 
in the discoverer’s mind as well as ttyeir precise ex 
pression in the form of definitions or axioms when 
that can be done is an essential part in the establish 
ment of all exact and general physical truths in doing 
this j have endeavoured to explain in what sense the 
possession of clear and appropriate ideas is a main 
 equisite for every step in scieutific discovery that i 
is far from being the only step i shall soon have to 
show and if any obscurity remain on the subject 
treated of in the present chapter it will i hope be 
removed when we have examined the other elements

of facts as the materials of science 


aphorism iy 

facts arc the materials of science but att facts nvolve 
tdeas since in observing facts we cannot exclude ideas 
we must for the purposes of science take care that the ideas 
are clear and rigorously applied 

aphorism y 

the last aphorism leads to such rules as the following — 
that facts for the purposes of material science muft involve 
conceptions of the intellect only and not emotions — that 
facts must be observed with reference to our most exact con 
ceptions number place figure motion — that they must 
also be observed with reference to any other exact conceptions 
which the phenomena suggest as force in mechanical pheno 
mena concord in musical 

aphorism yl 

the resolution of complex facts into precise and measured 
partial facts we call the decomposition of facts this 
process is requisite for the progress of science lut does not 
necessarily lead to progress 

i xtte have now to examine liow science is built 

v v up by the combination of facts in doing this 
we suppose that we have already attained a supply of 
definite and certain facts free from obscurity and doubt 
we must therefore first consider under what condi 
tions facts can asume this character 

when we inquire what facts are to be made the 
materials of science perhaps the answer which we 



of facts as tiie materials of science t 


should most commonly receive would be that they 
must be true facts as distinguished from any mere 
inferences or opinions of our own we should pro 
bably be told that we must be careful in such a case to 
consider as facts only what we really observe — that 
we must assert only what we see and believe nothing 
except upon the testimony of out senses 

but such maxims are far from being easy to apply 
as a little examination will convince us 

 it lias been explained in preceding works 
that fill perception of external objects and occur 
rences involves an active as well as a passive process 
of the mind — includes not only sensations but also 
ideas by which sensations are bound together and 
have a unity given to them from this it follows that 
there is a difficulty in separating in our perceptions 
what we receive from without and what we ourselves 
contribute from within — what we perceive and what 
we infer in many cases this difficulty is obvious to 
all as for example when we witness the performances 
of a juggler or a ventriloquist in these instances we 
imagine ourselves to see and to hear what certainly we 
do hot see and hear the performer takes advantage 
of the habits by which our minds supply interruptions 
and infer connexions and by giving us fallacious indi 
cations lie leads us to perceive as an actual fact what 
does not happen at all in these cases it is evident 
that we cmrselves assist in making the fact for we 
make one which does not really exist in other cases 
though the fact which we perceive be true we can 
easily see that a large portion of the perception is our 
own act as when from the sight of a bird of prey we 
infer a carcase or when we read a halfobliterated in 
scription in the latter case the mind supplies the 
meaning and perhaps half the letters yet we do not 
hesitate to say that we actually read the inscription 
thus in many cases our own inferences and interpre 
tations enter into our facts but this happens in 
many instances in which it is at first sight less obvious 
when any one has seen an oaktree blown down by a 
strong gust of wind he does not think of the occurrence 



 


construction of science 


any otherwise than as a fact of which he is assured by 
his senses yet by what sense does lie perceive the 
force which he thus supposes the wind to exert by 
what sense does he distinguish an oaktree from all 
other trees it is clear upon reflexion that in such 
a case his own mind supplies the conception of extra 
neous impulse and pressure by which he thus inter 
prets the motions observed and the distinction of 
different kinds of trees according to which he thus 
names the one under his notice the idea of force 
and the idea of delinite resemblances and did educes 
are thus combined with the impressions on our senses 
and form an undistinguished portion of that which we 
consider as the fact and it is evident that we can in 
no other way perceive force than by seeing motion 
and cannot give a name to any object without not 
only seeing a difference of single objects but supposing 
a difference of classes of objects when we speak as 
if we saw impulse and attraction things and classes 
we really see only objects of various forms and colours 
more or less numerous variously combined but do 
we really perceive so much as this when we see the 
form the size the number the motion of objects are 
these really mere impressions on our senses unmo 
dified by any contribution or operation of the mind 
itself a very little attention will sufliee to convince 
ns that this is not the case when we see a windmill 
turning it may happen as we have elsewhere noticed 
that we mistake the direction in which the sails turn 
when we look at certain diagrams they may appear 
either convex or concave when we sec the moon first 
in the horizon and afterwards high up in the sky we 
judge her to be much larger in the former than in the 
latter position although to the eye she subtends the 
same angle and in these cases and the like it lias 
been seen that the errour and confusion which wc thus 
incur jirise from the mixture of acts of the mind itself 
with impressions pn the senses but such acts are as 
we have also seen inseparable portions of tli process 


 history of ideas b ii c vl s g 



of facts as the materials of science 

of perception a certain activity of t£e mind is in 
volved not only in seeing objects erroneously but in 
seeing tliem at all with regard to solid objects this 
is generally acknowledged when we seem to see an 
edifice occupying space in all dimensions we really see 
only a representation of it as it appears referred by 
perspective to a surface the inference of he solid 
form is an operation of our own alike when we look at 
a reality and when we look at a picture but we may 
go further is plane figure really a mere sensation 
if we look at a decagon do we see at once that it has 
ten snles or vs it not necessary for us to count them 
and is not counting an act of the jnind all objects 
are seen in space all objects are seen as one or many 
but are not the idea of space and the idea of number 
requisite in order that we may thus apprehend what 
we sec l that these ideas of space and number in 
volve a connexion derived from the mind and not from 
the senses appears as we have already seeiif frorft this 
that those ideas afford us the materials of universal 
and necessary truths — such truths as the senses can 
not possibly supply and thus even the perception of 
sucji facts as the size shape and number of objects 
cannot be said to be impressions of sense distinct from 
all acts of mind and cannot be expected to be free 
from errour on the ground of their being mere observed 
facts 

thus the difficulty which we have been illustrating 
of distinguishing facts from inferences and from inter 
pretations of facts is not only great but amounts to an 
impossibility the separation at which we aimed in 
the outset of this discussion and which was supposed 
to be necessary in order to obtain a firm groundwork 
for science is found to be unattainable we cannot 
obtain a sure basis of facts by rejecting all inferences 
and judgments of our own for such inferences and 
judgments form an unavoidable clement in all facts 
we cannot exclude our ideas from our perceptions 
for our perceptions involve our ideas 

 bat still it cannot be doubted that in selecting 
the facts which are to form the foundation of science 



 construction of science 

 

we must reduce them to their most simple and certain 
form and must reject everything from which doubt or 
errour may arise now since this it appears cannot 
be done by rejecting the ideas which all facts in 
volve in what manner are we to conform to the ob 
vious maxim that the facts which form the basis of 
science ifrust be perfectly definite and certain 

the analysis of facts into ideas and sensations 
which we have so often referred to suggests the an 
swer to this inquiry we are not able nor need we 
endeavour to exclude ideas from our facts but we 
may be able to discern with perfect distinctness the 
deas which we include we cannot observe any phe 
nomena without applying to them such ideas as space 
and number cause and resemblance and usually 
several others but we may avoid applying these ideas 
in a wavering or obscure manner and confounding 
ideas with one another we cannot read any of the 
inscriptions which nature presents to us without in 
terpreting them by means of some language which we 
ourselves are accustomed to speak but we may make 
it our business to acquaint ourselves perfectly with the 
language which we thus employ and to interpret it ac 
cording to the rigorous rules of grammar and analogy 

this maxim that when facts are employed as the 
basis of science we must distinguish clearly the ideas 
which they involve and must apply these in a distinct 
and rigorous manner will be found to be a more pre 
cise guide than we might perhaps at first expect we 
may notice one or two rules which flow from it 

 in the first place facts when used as the mate 
rials of physical science itmst be referred to concep 
tions of the intellect only all emotions of fear admira 
tion and the like being rejected or subdued thus 
the observations of phenomena which are related as 
portents and prodigies striking terrour and boding 
evil are of no value for purposes of science the tales 
of armies seen warring in the sky the sound of arms 
heard from the clouds fiery dragons chariots swords 
seen in the air may refer to meteorological pheno 
mena but the records of phenomena observed in the 



of facts as the materials of science 


state of mind which these descriptions imply can be 
of no scientific value we cannot make the poets our 
observers 

armorum sonitum toto germania ccelo 
audiif insolitis tremuerunt motibus alpes 

vox quoque per lucos vulgo exaudita silcnesf 
ingens et simulacra modis pallentia miris 
visa sub obscurum noctis pecudesque locutse 

tlie mixture of fancy and emotion with tjie observation 
of facts has often disfigured them to an extent which 
is too familiar to all to need illustration we have an 
example of this result in the manner in which comets 
are described in the treatises of the middle ages in 
such works these bodies are regularly distributed into 
several classes accordingly as they assume the form of 
a sword of a spear of a cross and so on when such 
resemblances had become matters of interest the im 
pressions of the senses were governed not by the rigor 
ous conceptions of form and colour but by tliqpe as 
sumed images and under these circumstances we can 
attach little value to the statement of what was seen 

in alj such phenomena the reference of the objects 
to the exact ideas of space number position motion 
and the like is the first step of science and accord 
ingly this reference was established at an early period 
in those sciences which made an early progress as for 
instance astronomy yet even in astronomy there 
appears to have been a period when the predominant 
conceptions of men in regarding the heavens and the 
stars pointed to mythical story and supernatural in 
fluence rather than to mere relations of space time 
and motion and of this primeval condition of those 
who gazed at the stars we seem to have remnants in 
the constellations in the mythological names of the 
planets and in the early prevalence of astrology it 
was only at a later period when men had begun to 
measure the places or at least to count the revolutions 
of the stars that astronomy had its tiirth 

r and thus we are led to another rule — that in 
collecting facts which are to be made the basis of 



 construction of science 

 

science the facts are to be observed as far as possible 
with reference to place figure number motion and the 
like conceptions which depending upon the ideas of 
space and time are the most universal exact and 
simple of our conceptions it was by early attention to 
these relations in the case of the heavenly bodies that 
the ancients formed the science of astronomy it was 
by not making precise observations of this kind in the 
case of terrestrial bodies that they failed in framing a 
science of the mechanics of motion they succeeded 
in optics as far as they made observations of tips na 
ture but when they ceased to trace the geometrical 
‘aths of rays in the actual experiment they ceased to 
go forwards in the knowledge of this subject 

 but we may state a further kule — that though 
these relations of time and space are highly important 
in almost all facts we are not to confine ourselves to 
these but arc to consider the phenomena loith reference 
to otjicr conceptions also it being always understood 
that these conceptions are to be made as exact and 
rigorous as those of geometry and number thus the 
science of harmonics arose from considering sounds 
with reference to concords and dis fords the science 
of mechanics arose from not only observing motions as 
tley take place in time and space but further refer 
ring them to force as their cause and in like man 
ner other sciences depend upon other ideas which as 
i have endeavoured to show are not less fundamental 
than those of time and space and like them capable 
of leading to rigor oivs consequences 

 thus the facts which we assume as the basis of 
science are to be freed frftm all the mists which ima 
gination and passion throw round them and to be 
separated into those elementary facts which exhibit 
simple and evident relations of time or space or 
cause or some other ideas equally clear we resolve 
the complex appearances which nature offers to us 
and tile mixed and manifold modes of looking at these 
appearances whidh rise in our thoughts into limited 
definite and clearlyunderstood portions this process 
we may term the decomposition of facts it is the 



of facts as the materials of science 

beginning of exact knowledge —the first step in the 
formation of all science this decomposition of facts 
into elementary facts clearly understood and surely 
ascertained must precede all discovery of tlte laws of 
nature 

 but though this step is necessary it is nof infal 
libly sufficient it by no means follows that vhen we 
have thus decomposed facts into elementary truths 
of observation we shall soon be able to combine these 
so as to obtain truths of a higher and more specula 
tive kind we have examples which show us how 
far this is from being a necessary consequence of the 
former step observations of the weather made ad 
recorded for many years have not led to any gmicral 
truths forming a science of meteorology and altnougli 
great numerical precision has been given to such ob 
servations by means of barometers thermometers and 
other instruments still no general laws regulating the 
cycles of change of such phenomena have yet been 
discovered in like manner the faces of crystals and 
the sides of the polygons which these crystals form 
were counted and thus numerical facts were obtained 
perfectly true ’and definite but still of value for 
purposes of sence and when it was discovered 
what element of the form of crystals it was important 
to observe and measure namely the angle madfc by 
two faces with each other this discovery was a step of 
a higher order and did not belong to that depart 
ment of mere exact observation of manifest facts 
with which we are here concerned 

 when the complex facts which nature offers to 
us are tus decomposed into simple facts the decom 
position in general leads to the introduction of terms 
and phrases more or less technical by which these 
simple facts are described when astronomy was 
thus made a science of measurement the things mea 
sured were soon described as hours and jays and 
cycles altitude and declination phases an aspects 
in the same maimer hi music the concords had names 
assigned them as diapente diatessaron diapason in 
studying optics the hays of light were spoken of as 



 


construction ou science 


having their course altered by reflexion and refrac 
tion and when useful observations began to be made 
in mechanics the observers spoke of force pressure 
momentum inertia and the like 

 when we take phenomena in which the lead 
ing idea is resemblance and resolve them lhto precise 
component facts we obtain some kind of classifica 
tion as for instance when we lay down certain rules 
by which particular trees or particular animals are to 
be known this is the earliest form of natural his 
tory and the classification which it invokes is that 
which corresponds nearly or exactly with the usual 
names of the objects thus classified 

ii thus the first attempts to render observation 
certain and exact lead to a decomposition of the ob 
vious facts into elementary facts connected by the 
ideas of space time number cause likeness and 
others and into a classification of the simple facts 
a classification more or less just and marked by names 
either common or technical elementary facts and 
individual objects thus observed and classified form 
the materials of science and any improvement in 
classification or nomenclature or an discovery of h 
connexion among the materials thus accumulated 
leds us fairly within the precincts of science we 
must now therefore consider the manner in which 
science is built up of such materials — the process by 
which they are brought into their places and he tex 
ture of the bond which unites and cements them 



chapter iv 


of the colligation of facts 


aphorism vii 

science begins with common observation of facts but 
even at this stage requires that the observations be precise 
hence the sciences which depend upon space and number 
were the earliest formed after common observation come 
scientific observation and experiment 

aphorism viii 

the conceptions by which facts are bound together are 
suggested by the sagacity of discoverers this sagacity can 
not bejtaught it commonly succeeds by guessing and this 
success seems to consist in framing several tentative hypo 
theses a nd selecting the right one but a supply of appro 
priate hypotheses cannot be constructed by rule nor without 
inventive talent 


aphorism ix 

the truth of tentative hypotheses must be tested by their 
application to facts the discoverer mpst be ready care 
fully to try his hypotheses in this manner and to reject 
them if they will not bear the test in spite of indolence and 
vanity 

i tracts such as the last chapter speaks of are by 
jl means of such conceptions as are described in 
the preceding chapter bound together so as to give 
rise to those general propositions of which science 
consists thus the facts that the planets revolve 



o 


construction of science 


about the sun m certain periodic times and at certain 
distances are included and connected in kepler’s law 
by means of such conceptions as the squares of num 
bers tli q cubes of distances and the proportionality of 
these quantities again the existence of this propor 
tion in the motions of any two planets forms a set of 
facts wh ch may all be combined by means of the 
conception of a certain central accelerating force as 
was proved by kcwton the whole of our physical 
knowledge consists in the establishment of such pro 
positions and in all such cases facts are bound to 
gether by the aid of suitable conceptions tliispart 
qf the formation of our knowledge i have called the 
colligation of facu and we may apply this term to 
every case in which by an act of the intellect we 
establish a precise connexion among the phenomena 
which arc presented to our senses the knowledge of 
such connexions accumulated and systematized is 
science on the steps by which science is thus col 
lected from phenomena we shall proceed now to make 
a few remarks 

 science begins with common observation of 
facts in which we are not conscious of any peculiar 
discipline or habit of thought exercised in observing 
thus the common perce tions of tlie appearances and 
recurrences of the celestial luminaries were the first 
steps of a stronoiuy the obvious cases in which bodies 
fall or are supported were the beginning of mechanics 
the familiar aspects of visible filings were the origin 
of optics the usual distinctions of wellknown plants 
first gave rise to botany facts belonging to such 
parts of our knowledge are noticed by us and accumu 
lated in our memories in the common course of our 
habits almost without our being aware that we are 
observing and collecting facts yet such facts may 
lead to many scientific truths for instance in the first 
stages of astronomy as we have shown in the history 
such faets led to methods of intercalation and buies 
of the ptecurrence of eclipses in succeeding stages 
of science more especial attention and preparation on 
the part of the observer and a selection of certain 



of the colligation of facts 

kinds of facts becomes necessary but there is an early 
period in the progress of knowledge at which man is 
a physical philosopher withcit seeking to be so or 
being aware that he is so 

 but in all stages of the progress even in that 
early one ot which we have just spoken it is neces 
sary in order that the facts may be fit materials of 
any knowledge that they should be decomposed into 
elementary facts and that these should be observed 
with precision thus in the first infancy of astro 
nomy the recurrence of phases of the moon of places 
of the sun’s rising and setting of planets of eclipse 
was observed to take place at intervals of certain defi 
nite numbers of days and in a certain exact order 
and thus it was that the observations became portions 
of astronomical science in other cases although the 
facts were equally numerous and their general aspect 
equally familiar they led to no science becausy their 
exact circumstances were not apprehended a vague 
and loose mode of looking at facts very easily observ 
able left men for a long time under the belief that a 
body ten times as heavy as another falls ten times as 
fast that objects immersed in water are always mag 
nified without regard to the form of the surface — 
that the magnet exerts an irresistible force — that 

 crystal is always found associated with ice — and the 
like these and many others are examples how blind 
and careless men can be even in observation of the 
plainest and commonest appearances and they show 
ns that thy mere faculties of perception although con 
stantly exercised upon innumerable objects may long 
fail in leading to any exact knowledge 

 if we further inquire what was the favourable 
condition through which some special classes of facts 
wore from thy first fitted to become portions of sci 
ence we shall find it to have been principally this — 
that these facts were considered with reference to the 
ideas of time number and space which are ideas 
possessing peculiar definiteness and precision so that 
with regard to them confusion and indistinctness are 
hardly possible the interval from new moon to new 



 


construction of science 


moon was always a particular number of days the 
sun in his yearly course rose and set near to a known 
succession of distant olects the moon’s path passed 
among the stars in a certain order — these are obser 
vations in which mistake and obscurity are not likely 
to occui f the sfnallest degree of attention is bestowed 
upon the task to count a number is from the first 
opening of man’s mental faculties an operation which 
no science can render more precise the relations of 
space are nearest to those of number in obvious and 
universal evidence sciences depending upon tliese 
ideas arise with the first dawn of intellectual civiliza 
tion but few of the other ideas which man employs 
in the acquisition of knowledge possess this clearness 
in their common use the idea of resemblance may 
be noticed s coming next to those of space and num 
ber in original precision and the idea of cause in a 
certain vague and general mode of application suffi 
cient for the purposes of common life but not for the 
ends of science exercises a very extensive influence 
over men’s thoughts but the other ideas on which 
science depends with the conceptions which arise out 
of them are not unfolded till a much later period of 
intellectual progress and therefore except in such 
limited cases as i have noticed the observations of 
common spectators and uncultivated nations however 
numerous or varied are of little or no effect in giving 
rise to science 

 let us now suppose that besides common every 
day perception of fadls we turn our attention to some 
other occurrences and appearances with a design of 
obtaining from fhem speculative knowledge this 
process is more peculiarly called observation or when 
we ourselves occasion the facts experiment but the 
same remark which we have already mde still holds 
good here these facts can be of no value except 
they are resolved into those exat conceptions which 
contain the essential circumstances of the case they 
must be determined not indeed necessarily as has 
sometimes befen said ‘ according to number weight 
and measure’ for as we have endeavoured to show 



of the colligation of facts 

in the preceding books there are many other con 
ceptions to which phenomena may be subordinated 
quite different from these and yet not at all less defi 
nite and precise but in order that the facts obtained 
by observation and experiment may be capable of 
being used in furtherance of our exact and solid know 
ledge they must be apprehended and analysed accord 
ing to some conceptions which applied for this pur 
pose give distinct and definite results such as can be 
steadily taken hold of and reasoned froja that is the 
facts must be referred to clear and appropriate ideas 
according tothe manner in which we have already ex 
plained this condition of the derivation of our kno 
ledge the phenomena of light when they are such 
as to indicate sides in the ray must be referred to the 
conception of polarization the phenomena of mix 
ture when there is an alteration of qualities as well 
as quantities must be combined by a conception of 
elementary composition and thus when mers posi 
tion and number and resemblance will no longer an 
swer the purpose of enabling us to connect the facts 
we call in other ideas in such cases more efficacious 
thqugh less obvidus 

 ibut how are we in these cases to discover such 
ideas and to judge which will be efficacious in leadyig 
to a scientific combination of our experimental data 
to this question we must in the first place answer 
that the first and great instrument by which facts so 
observed with a view to the formation of exact know 
ledge are combined into important and permanent 
truths is tat peculiar sagacity ’which belongs to the 
genius of a discoverer and which while it supplies 
those distinct and appropriate conceptions which lead 
to its success cannot be limited by rules or expressed 
in definitions it would be difficult or impossible to 
describe in words the habits of thought which led ar 
chimedes to refer the conditions of equilibrium on the 
lever to the conception of pressure while aristotle 
could not see in them anything moi than the results 


 hist of sci id ls v vl vii viii ix x

of tlie strangeness v of the properties of the circle — 
or which impelled pascal to explain by means of the 
conception of the weight of air the facts which his 
predecessors had connected by the notion of nature’s 
horrour of a vacuum — or which caused vitello and 
roger bacon to refer the magnifying power of a con 
vex lens to the bending of the rays of light towards 
the perpendicular by refraction while others conceived 
the effect to result ‘from the matter of medium with 
no consideratiqp of its form these are what are com 
monly spoken of as felicitous and inexplipable smokes 
of inventive talent and such no doubt they are no 
fules can ensure tous similar success in new cases or 
can enable men who do not possess similar endow 
ments to make like advances in knowledge 

 yet still we may do something in tracing the 
process by which such discoveries are made and this 
it is here our business to do we may observe that 
theseand the like discoveries are not improperly de 
scribed as happy guesses and that guesses in these 
as in other instances imply various suppositions made 
of which some one turns out to be the right one we 
may in such cases edheeive the discoverer as invent 
ing and trying many conjectures till he finds one 
•which answers the purpose of combining the scattered 
facts into a single rule the discovery of general 
truths from special facts is performed commonly at 
least and more commonly than at first appears by 
the use of a series of suppositions or hypotheses 
which are looked atdn quick succession and of which 
the one which really leads to truth is rapidly detected 
and when caught sight of firmly held verified and 
followed to its consequences in the minds of most 
discoverers this process invention trial and accept 
ance or rejection of the hypothesis goes on so rapidly 
that we cannot trace it in its successive steps but in 
some instances we can do so and we can also see that 
the other examples of discovery do not differ essen 
tially from these the same intellectual operations 
take place in other cases although this often happens 
so instantaneously that we lose the trace of the pro 



of the colligation of facts 

gression in the discoveries made by kepler we have 
a curious and memorable exhibition of this process in 
its details thanks to his communicative disposition 
we know that he made nineteen hypotheses with re 
gard to the motion of mars and calculated the results 
of each before he established the true doctrine that 
the planet’s path is an ellipse we know in like man 
ner that galileo made wrong suppositions respecting 
the laws of falling bodies and mariotte concerning 
the motion of water in a siphon before they hit upon 
the correct view of these cases 

 but ithas very often happened in the history of 
science that the erroneous hypotheses which preceded 
the discovery of the truth have been made not by the 
discoverer himself but by his precursors to whom he 
thus owed the service often an important one in such 
cases of exhausting the most tempting forms of errour 
thus the various fruitless suppositions by which kep 
ler endeavoured to discover the law of refraction led 
the way to its real detection by snell kepler’s nume 
rous imaginations concerning the forces by which the 
celestial motions are produced — his ‘ physical reason 
ings as he termed them — were a natural prelude to 
the truer physical reasonings of newton the various 
hypotheses by which the suspension of vapour in air 
had been explained and their failure left the field 
open for dalton with his doctrine of the mechanical 
mixture of gases in most cases if we could truly 
analyze the operation of the thoughts of those who 
make or who endeavour to inakfj discoveries in sci 
ence we should find that many more suppositions pass 
through their minds than those which are expressed 
in words many a possible combination of conceptions 
is formed and soon rejected there is a constant in 
vention and activity a perpetual creating and selecting 
power at work of which the last results only are ex 
hibited to s trains of hypotheses are called up and 
pass rapidly in re vie and the judgment makes its 
choice from the varied group 

 it would however be a great mistake to sup 
pose that the hypotheses among which our choice thus 

nov orfl £ 



 


construction of science 


lies are constructed by an enumeration of obvious 
cases or by a wanton alteration of relations which 
occur in some first hypothesis it may indeed some 
times happen that the proposition which is finally 
established is such as may be formed by some slight 
alteration from those which are justly rejected thus 
kepler’s ‘elliptical theory of mars’s motions involved 
relations of lines and angles much of the same nature 
as his previous false suppositions and the true law of 
refraction so much resembles those erroneous ones 
which kepler tried that we cannot help wondering 
how he chanced to miss it but it more frequently 
happens that new truths are brought into view by the 
application of new ideas not by new modifications of 
old ones the cause of the properties of the lever 
was learnt not by introducing any new geometrical 
combination of lines and circles but by referring the 
properties to genuine mechanical conceptions when 
the motions of the planets were to be explained this 
was done not by merely improving the previous no 
tions of cycles of time but by introducing the new 
conception of epicycles in space the doctrine of the 
four simple elements was expelled not by forming 
any new scheme of elements which should impart 
according to new rules their sensible qualities to their 
compounds but by considering the elements of bodies 
as neutralizing each other the fringes of shadows 
could not be explained by ascribing new properties to 
the single rays of light but were reduced to law by 
referring them to th interference of several rays 

since the true supposition is thus very frequently 
something altogether diverse from all the obvious con 
jectures and combinations we see here how far we are 
from being able to reduce discovery to rule or to give 
any precepts by which the want of real invention and 
sagacity shall be supplied we may warn and en 
courage these faculties when they exist but we cannot 
create them or make great discoveries when they are 
absent 

io the conceptions which a true theory requires 
are very often clothed in a hypothesis which connects 



of the colligation of fcts j 

with them several superfluous and irrelevant circum 
stances thus the conception of the polarization of 
light was originally represented under the image of 
particles of light having their poles all turned in the 
same direction the laws of heat may be made out 
perhaps most conveniently by conceiving hat to be 
a fluid the attraction of gravitation might have 
been successfully applied to the explanation of facts if 
newton had throughout treated attraction as the re 
sult of an ether diffused through space a supposition 
which he ha noticed as a possibility the doctrine of 
definite and multiple proportions may be conveniently 
expressed by the hypothesis of atofus in such cases 
the hypothesis may serve at first to facilitate the in 
troduction of a new conception thus a pervading 
ether might for a time remove a difficulty which some 
persons find considerable of imagining a body to exert 
force at a distance a particle with poles is more 
easily conceived than polarization in the abstract 
and if hypotheses thus employed will really explain 
the facts by means of a fev simple assumptions the 
laws so obtained may afterwards be reduced to a sim 
ple form than that in which they were first suggested 
the general laws of heat of attraction of polariza 
tion of multiple proportions are now certain whitt 
•ever image we may form to ourselves of their ultimate 
causes 

ii in order then to discover scientific truths sup 
positions consisting either of new conceptions or of 
new combinations of old ones are to be made till we 
find one supposition which succeeds in jbinding together 
the facts but how are we to find this how is the 
trial to be made what is meant by ‘success’ in these 
cases to this we reply that our inquiry must be 
whether the facts have the same relation in the hypo 
thesis which they have in reality — whether the results 
of our suppositions agee with the phenomena which 
nature presents to us for this purpose we must 
both carefully observe the phenomena and steadily 
trace the consequences of our assumptions till we can 

 — 



 construction of science 

bring the two into comparison the conceptions which 
our hypotheses involve being derived from certain 
fundamental ideas afford a basis of rigorous reasoning 
as we have shown in the books of the history of those 
ideas and the results to which this reasoning leads 
will be susceptible of being verified or contradicted by 
observation of the facts thus the epicyclical theory 
of the moon once assumed determined what the 
moon’s place among the stars ought to be at any given 
time and could therefore be tested by actually observ 
ing the moon’s places the doctrine uhat musical 
strings of the same length stretched with weights of 
i would give the musical intervals of an oc 
tave a fifth a fourth in succession could be put to the 
trial by any one whose ear was capable of appreciating 
those intervals and the inference which follows from 
this doctrine by numerical reasoning — that there must 
be certain imperfections in the concords of every mu 
sical scale — could in like manner be confirmed by try 
ing various modes of temperament in like manner 
all received theories in science up to the present time 
have been established by taking up some supposition 
and comparing it directly or by means of its remoter 
consequences with the facts it was intended to embrace 
its agreement under certain cautions and conditions 
of which we may hereafter speak is held to be the evi 
dence of its truth it answers its genuine purpose 
the colligation of facts 

 when we have in any subject succeeded in one 
attempt of this kind and obtained some time bond of 
unity by which the phenomena are held together the 
subject is open to further prosecution which ulterior 
process may for the most part be conducted in a more 
formal and technical manner the first great outline 
of the subject is drawn and the finishing of the re 
semblance of nature demands a more minute pencilling 
but perhaps requires less of genius in the master in 
the pursuance of this task rules and precepts may be 
given and features and leading circumstances pointed 
out of which it may often be useful to the inquirer to 
be aware 



of the colligation of facts 

before proceeding further i shall speak of some 
characteristic marks which belong to such scientific 
processes as are now the subject of our consideration 
and which may sometimes aidus in determining when 
the task has been rightly executed 



chapter v 


of certain characteristics of scientific 
induction 


aphorism x 

the process of sciefitific discovery is cautious and rigorous 
not by abstaining from hypotheses but by rigorously com 
paring hypotheses with facts and by resolutely rejecting all 
which the comparison does not confirm 

aphorism xi 

hypotheses may be useful though involving much that is 
superfluous and even erroneous for they may supply the 
true bond of connexion of the facts and the superfluity and 
errour may afterwards be pared away 

aphorism xii 

it is a test of true theories not only to account for but to 
predict phenomena 


 

aphorism xiii 

induction is a term applied to describe the process of a 
true colligation of facts by means of an exact and appro 
priate conception an induction is also employed to denote 
the proposition which results from this process 

aphorism xiv 

the consilience of inductions takes place when an 
induction obtained from one class of facts coincides with 
an induction obtained from another different class this 



characteristics op scientific induction 


consilience vs a test of the truth of the theory in which it 
occurs 

aphorism xv 

an induction is not the mere sum of the facts which are 
colligated the facts are not only brought together but seem 
in a new point of view a new mental element is super 
induced and a peculiar constitution and discipline of mind 
are requisite in order to make this induction 

aphorism xyi 

although in every induction a new conception is super 
induced upon the facts yet this one effectually done the 
novelty of the conception is overlooked and the conception is 
considered as a part of the fact 

sect i — invention a part of induction 

t rrihe two operations spoken of in the preceding 

x chapters — the explication of the conceptions 
of our own minds and the colligation of observed facts 
by the aid of such conceptions — are as we have just 
said inseparably connected with each other when 
united and employed in collecting knowledge from tha 
phenomena which the jorld presents to us they con 
stitute the mental process of induction which is usu 
ally and justly spoken of as the genuine source of all 
our real general knowledge respecting the external 
world and we see from the preceding analysis of 
this process into its two constituents from what origin 
it derives each of its characters it is real because it 
arises from the combination of real facts but it is 
general because it implies the possession of general 
ideas without the former it would not be know 
ledge of the external world without the latter it 
would not be knowledge at all when ideas and 
facts are separated from each other the neglect of 
facts gives rise to empty speculates idle subtleties 
visionary inventions false opinions concerning the laws 
of phenomena disregard of the true aspect of nature 



 construption of science 

while the want of ideas leaves the mind overwhelmed 
bewildered and stupified by particular sensations with 
no means of connecting the past with the future the 
absent with the present the example with the rule 
open to the impression of all appearances but capable 
of appropriating none ideas are the fo m facts the 
material of our structure knowledge does not con 
sist in the empty mould or in the brute mass of mat 
ter but in the rightlymoulded substance induction 
gathers general truths from particular facts — and in 
her harvest the corn and the reaper the solid ears and 
the binding band are alike requisite all our know 
ledge of nature is obtained by induction the term 
being understood according to the explanation we have 
now given and our knowledge is then most com 
plete then most truly deserves the name of science 
when both its elements are most perfect — when the 
ideas which have been concerned in its formation have 
at every step been clear and consistent and when 
they have at every step also been employed in bind 
ing together real and certain facts of such induc 
tion i have already given so many examples and illus 
trations in the two preceding chapters that need not 
now dwell further upon the subject 

 induction is familiarly spoken of as the process 

by which we collect a general proposition from a num 
ber of particular cases and it appears to be fre 
quently imagined that the general proposition results 
from a mere juxtaposition of the cases or at most from 
merely conjoining end extending them but if we 
consider the process more closely as exhibited in the 
cases lately spoken of we shall perceive that this is an 
inadequate account of the matter the particular 
facts are not merely brought together but there is a 
new element added to the combination by the very 
act of thought by which they are combined there is 
a conception of the mind introduced in the general 
proposition which did not exist in any of the observed 
facts when tlm greeks after long observing the 
motions of the planets saw that these motions might 
be rightly considered as produced by the motion of one 



characteristics of scientific induction 

 

wheel revolving in the inside of ‘another wheel these 
wheels were creations of their minds added to the 
facts which they perceived by sense and even if the 
wheels were no longer supposed to be material but 
were reduced to mere geometrical spheres or circles 
they were mt the less products of the mind alone — 
something additional to the facts observed the same 
is the case in all other discoveries the facts are 
known but they are insulated and unconnected till 
the discoverer supplies from bis own stores a principle 
of connexion the pearls are there bift they will not 
hang vgetluh till some one provides the string the 
distances and periods of the planets were all so many 
separate facts by kepler’s third law they are con 
nected into a single truth but the conceptions which 
this law involves were supplied by kepler’s mind and 
without these the facts were of no avail the planets 
described ellipses round the sun in the contemplation 
of others as well as of newton but newton conceived 
the deflection from the tangent in these elliptical mo 
tions in a new light — as the effect of a central force 
following a certain law aftd then it was that such a 
foijce was discovered truly to exist 

thus in each inference made by induction there is 
introduced some general conception which is given v 
not by the phenomena but by the mind the con 
clusion is not contained in the premises but includes 
them by the introduction of a new generality in 
order to obtain our inference we travel beyond the 
cases which we have before us ve consider them as 
mere exemplifications of some ideal case in which the 
relations are complete and intelligible we take a 
standard and measure the facts by it and this 
standard is constructed by us not offered by nature 
w e assert for example that a body left to itself will 
move on with unaltered velocity not because our 
senses ever disclosed to us a body doing this but be 
cause taking this as tur ideal case we find idiat all 


 i repeat here remarks made at the end of the mechanical euclid p s 



 construction op science 

 

actual cases are intelligible and explicable by means of 
the conception of forces causing change and motion 
and exerted by surrounding bodies in like manner 
we see bodies striking each other and thus moving and 
stopping accelerating and retarding each ‘other but 
in all this we do not perceive by our senses that 
abstract quantity momentum which is always lost by 
one body as it is gained by another this momentum 
is a creation of the mind brought in among the facts 
in order to convert their apparent confusion into order 
their seeming chance into certainty their perplexing 
variety into simplicity this the conception of mo 
mentum gained and lost does and in like manner in 
any other case in which a truth is established by in 
duction some conception is introduced some idea is 
applied as the means of binding together the facts 
and thus producing the truth 

 hence in every inference by induction there is 
some conception superinduced upon the facts and 
we may henceforth conceive this to be the peculiar 
import of the term induction i am not to be under 
stood as asserting that the term was originally or 
anciently employed with this notion of its meaning 
for the peculiar feature just pointed out in induction 
has generally been overlooked this appears by the 
accounts generally given of induction ‘ induction 
says aristotle ‘is when by means of one extreme 
term we infer the other extreme term to be true of 
the middle term’ thus to take such exemplifications 
as belong to our subject from knowing that mercury 
venus mars describe ellipses about the sutt we infer 
that all planets describe ellipses about the sun in 
making this inference syllogistically we assume that 
the evident proposition ‘mercury venus mars do 
what all planets do may be taken conversely ‘all 


 analyt prior lib ii c xxiii depi iirayuiyrjs 

 hie syllogism here alluded to would be this 

mercury venurf mars describe ellipses about the sun 
all planets do what mercury venus mars do 
therefore all planets describe ellipses about the sun 



characteristics of scientific induction 

planets do what mercury venus mars do but we 
may remark that in this passage aristotle as was 
natural in his line of discussion turns his attention 
entirely to the evidence of the inference and overlooks 
a step which is of far more importance to our know 
ledge namely the invention of the second extreme 
term in the above instance the particular luminaries 
mercury venus mars are one logical extreme the 
general designation planets is the middle term but 
having these before us how do we come to think of 
description of ellipses which is the o slier extreme 
of the syllogism when we have once invented this 
‘ second extreme term’ we may or may not be satis 
fied with the evidence of the sylldism we may or 
may not be convinced that so far as this property 
goes the extremes are coextensive with the middle 
term but the statement of the syllogism is the im 
portant step in science we know how long kepler 
laboured how hard he fought how many deviqes he 
tried before he hit upon this term the elliptical 
motion he rejected as we know many other ‘ second 
extreme terms for examjfle various combinations of 
epipyclical constructions because they did not represent 
with sufficient accuracy the special facts of observa 
tion when he had established his premiss that ‘mars 
does describe an ellipse about the bun he does not 
hesitate to guess at least that in this respect he might 
convert the other premiss and assert that ‘ all the 
planets do what mars does but the main business 
was the inventing and verifying the proposition re 
specting tle ellipse the invention of the conception 
was the great step in the discovery te verification of 
the proposition was the great step in the proof of the 
discovery if logic consists in pointing out the con 
ditions of proof the logic of induction must consist in 
showing what are the conditions of proof in such infer 
ences as this but this subject must be pursued in the 
next chapter i now speak principally of theact of 


 ei otfv dvturrptfei to t rw b jcal uu vtrepreim rb fittrov — alistot ibid 



 construction of science 

invention winch is requisite in every inductive in 
ference 

 although in every inductive inference an act of 
invention is requisite the act soon slips out of notice 
although we bind together facts by superinducing 
upon them a new conception this conception once 
introduced and applied is looked upon as inseparably 
connected with the facts and necessarily implied in 
them having once had the phenomena bound to 
gether in their minds in virtue of the conception men 
can no longei easily restore them back to the detached 
and incoherent condition in which they were before 
they were thus combined the pearls once strung 
they seem to form a chain by their nature induction 
has given them a unity which it is so far from costing 
us an effort to preserve that it requires an effort to 
imagine it dissolved for instance we usually repre 
sent to ourselves the earth as round the earth and 
the pjanets as revolving about the sun and as drawn 
to the sun by a central force we can hardly under 
stand how it could cost the greeks and copernicus 
and newton so much pains and trouble to arrive at a 
view which to us is so familiar these are no longer 
to us conceptions caught hold of and kept hold of by 
a severe struggle they are the simplest modes of con 
ceiving the facts they are really facts we are will 
ing to own our obligation to those discoverers but we 
hardly feel it for in what other manner we ask in 
our thoughts could we represent the facts to our 
selves 

thus we see why it is that this step of which we 
now speak the invention of a new conception iii 
every inductive inference is so generally overlooked 
that it has hardly been noticed by preceding philoso 
phers when once performed by the discoverer it 
takes a fixed and permanent place in the understanding 
of every one it is a thought which once breathed 
forth permeates all men’s minds all fancy they 
nearly or quite knjw it before it oft was thought or 
almost thought though never till now expressed men 
accept it and retain it and know it cannot be taken

from them and look upon it as their own they will not 
and cannot part with it even though they may deem 
it trivial and obvious it isa secret whith once 
uttered cannot be recalled even though it be despised 
by those to v§hom it is imparted as soon as the lead 
ing term of a new theory has been pronouqped and 
understood all the phenomena change their aspect 
there is a standard to which we cannot help referring 
them we cannot fall back into the helpless and 
bewildered state in which we gazed at them when we 
possessed no principle which gave them unity eclipses 
arrive in mysterious confusion the notion of a cycle 
dispels the mystery the planets perform a tangled 
and mazy dance but epicycles reduce the maze to 
order the epicycles themselves run into confusion 
the conception of an ellipse makes all clear and simple 
and thus from stage to stage new elements of intel 
ligible order are introduced but this intelligible order 
is so completely adopted by the human understanding 
as to seem part of its texture men ask whether 
eclipses follow a cycle whether the planets describe 
ellipses and they imagine that so long as they do not 
answei • such questions rashly they take nothing for 
granted they do not recollect how much they assume 
in asking the question — how far the conceptions f 
cycles and of ellipses are beyond the visible surface of 
the celestial phenomena — how many ages elapsed 
how much thought how much observation were 
needed before men’s thoughts were fashioned into the 
words whih they now so familiarly use and thus 
they treat the subject as we have seen aristotle treat 
ing it as if it were a question not of invention but 
of proof not of substance but of form as if the main 
thing were not what we assert but how we assert it 
but for our purpose it is requisite to bear in mind the 
feature which we have thus attempted to mark and 
to recollect that in eery inference by induction there 
is a conception supplied by the mind and superinduced 
upon the facts 

 in collecting scientific truths by induction we 
often find as has already been observed a definition 



 construction of science 

and a proposition established at the same time — in 
troduced together and mutually dependent on each 
other rthe combination of the two constitutes the 
inductive act and we may consider the definition as 
representing the superinduced conception and the 
proposition as exhibiting the colligation of facts 

sect ii — use of hypotheses 

 to discover a conception of the mind which will 
justly represent a train of observed facts is in some 
measure a process of conjecture as i have stated al 
ready and as i tfyen observed the business of conjec 
ture is commonly conducted by calling up before our 
minds several suppositions and selecting that one which 
most agrees with what we know of the observed facts 
hence he who has to discover the laws of nature may 
have to invent many suppositions before he hits upon 
the right one and among the endowments which lead 
to his success we must reckon that fertility of inven 
tion which ministers to hiin such imaginary schemes 
till at last he finds the one which conforms to the true 
order of nature a facility in devising hypotheses 
therefore is so far from being a fault in the intellec 
tual character of a discoverer that it is in truth a 
faculty indispensable to his task it is for his pur 
poses much better that he should be too ready in con 
triving too eager in pursuing systems which promise 
to introduce law and order among a mass of unarranged 
facts than that he should be barren of such inventions 
and hopeless of such success accordingly as we have 
already noticed great discoverers have often invented 
hypotheses which would not answer to all the facts as 
well as those which would and have fancied them 
selves to have discovered laws which a more careful 
examination of the facts overturned 

the tendencies of our speculative nature carrying 


 i here take the liberty of charac the history of science i have em 
terizing inventive minds in general ployed in reference to particular ex 
in the same phraseology which in amples these expressions are what 



characteristics of scientific induction 

us onwards in pursuit of symmetry and rule and thus 
producing all true theories perpetually show their 
vigour by overshooting the mark they obtain some 
thing by aiming at much more they detect tlie order 
and connexion which exist by conceiving imaginary 
relations of ofder and connexion which have no exist 
ence real discoveries are thus mixed with baseless 
assumptions profound sagacity is combined with fan 
ciful conjecture not rarely or in peculiar instances 
but commonly and in most cases probably in all if we 
could read the thoughts of discoverers as we read the 
books of kepler to try wrong guesses is with most 
persons the only way to hit upon right ones the 
character of the true philosopher is not that he never 
conjectures hazardously but that liis conjectures are 
clearly conceived and brought into rigid contact with 
facts he sees and compares distinctly the ideas and 
the things — the relations of liis notions to each other 
and to phenomena under these conditions it is not 
only excusable but necessary for him to snatch at 
every semblance of general rule — to try all promising 
forms of simplicity and symfnetry 

hence advances in knowledge are not commonly 
made without the previous exercise of some boldness 
and license in guessing the discovery of new truths 
requires undoubtedly minds careful and scrupulous in 
examining what is suggested but it requires no less 
such as are quick and fertile in suggesting what is 
invention except the talent of rapidly calling before us 
the many possibilities and selecting the appropriate 
one it is true that when we have rejected all the 
inadmissible suppositions they are often quickly for 
gotten and few think it necessary to dwell on these

 these observations are made on sect 



 construction of science 

every accepted doctrine must have been one chosen 
out of many candidates if many of the guesses of 
philosophers of bygone times now appear fanciful and 
absurd because time and observation have refuted them 
others which were at the time equally gratuitous have 
been confirmed in a manner which make£ them appear 
marvellously sagacious to form hypotheses and then 
to employ much labour and skill in refuting them if 
they do not succeed in establishing them is a part of 
the usual process of inventive minds such a proceed 
ing belongs to the rule of the genius of discovery 
rather than as has often been taught in modern times 
to the exception 

 but if it be an advantage for the discoverer of 
truth that he be ingenious and fertile in inventing 
hypotheses which may connect the phenomena of na 
ture it is indispensably requisite that he be diligent 
and careful in comparing his hypotheses with the facts 
and ready to abandon his invention as soon as it ap 
pears that it does not agree with the course of actual 
occurrences this constant comparison of his own 
conceptions and supposition with observed facts under 
all aspects forms the leading employment of ho dis 
coverer this candid and simple love of truth which 
 makes him willing to suppress the most favourite pro 
duction of his own ingenuity as soon as it appears to 
be at variance with realities constitutes the first cha 
racteristic of his temper he must have neither the 
blindness which cannot nor the obstinacy which will 
not perceive the discrepancy of his fancies and his 
facts he must allow no indolence or partial views 
or selfcomplacency or delight in seeming demonstra 
tion to make him tenacious of the schemes which he 
devises any further than they are confirmed by their 
accordance with nature the framing of hypotheses 
is for the inquirer after truth not the end but the 
beginning of his work each of his systems is in 
vented not ’that he may admire it and follow it into 
all its consistent consequences but that he may make 
it the occasion of a course of active experiment and 
observation and if the results of this process contra

diet his fundamental assumptions however ingenious 
however symmetrical however elegant his system may 
be he rejects it without hesitation he allows no 
natural yearning for the offspring of his own mind to 
draw him asijie from the higher duty of loyalty to his 
sovereign truth to her he not only gives ipg affec 
tions and his wishes but strenuous labour and scrupu 
lous minuteness of attention 

we may refer to what we have said of kepler new 
ton and other eminent philosophers fo illustrations 
of thi§ character in kepler we have remarked the 
courage and perseverance with which he undertook and 
executed the task of computing hi own hypotheses 
and as a still more admirable characteristic that he 
never allowed the labour he had spent upon any con 
jecture to produce any reluctance in abandoning the 
hypothesis as soon as he had evidence of its inac 
curacy and in the history of newton’s discovery 
that the moon is retained in her orbit by the force of 
gravity we have noticed the same moderation in main 
taining the hypothesis aftr it had once occurred to 
the author’s mind the hypothesis required that the 
moon should fall from the tangent of her orbit every 
second through a space of sixteen feet but according 
to his first calculations it appeared that in fact she on 
oil through a space of thirteen feet in that time the 
difference seems small the approximation encouraging 
the theory plausible a man in love with his own fan 
cies would readily have discovered or invented some 
probable cause of the difference but newton acqui 
esced in itas a disproof of his conjecture and ‘laid 
aside at that time any further thbughts of this matter ’ 

 it has often happened that those who have under 
taken to instruct mankind have not possessed this pure 
love of truth and comparative indifference to the main 
tenance of their own inventions men have frequently 
adhered with great tenacity and vehemence to the hy 
potheses which they have once framed and in their

affection for these have been prone to overlook to dis 
tort and to misinterpret facts in this manner hypo 
theses have so often been prejudicial to the genuine 
pursuit of truth that they have fallen into a kind of 
obloquy and have been considered as dangerous temp 
tation and fallacious guides many warnings have 
been uttered against the fabrication of hypotheses by 
those who profess to teach philosophy many disclaimers 
of such a course by those who cultivate science 

thus we shall find bacon frequently discommending 
this habit under the name of ‘ anticipation of the mind 
and newton thinks it necessary to say emphatically 
‘ hypotheses non fingo’ it lias been constantly urged 
that the inductions by which sciences are formed must 
be cautious and rigorous and the various imaginations 
which passed through kepler’s brain and to which he 
has given utterance have been blamed or pitied us 
lamentable instances of an unphilosophical frame of 
mind yet it has appeared in the preceding remarks 
that hypotheses rightly used are among the helps far 
more than the dangers of science — that scientific in 
duction is not a ‘cautious’ or a ‘rigorous’ process in 
the sense of abstaining from such suppositions but in 
not adhering to them till they are confirmed by fact and 
ii carefully seeking from facts confirmation or refuta 
tion kepler’s distinctive character was not that he was 
peculiarly given to the construction of hypotheses but 
that he narrated with extraordinary copiousness and 
candour the course of his thoughts his labours and 
his feelings in th minds of most persons as we have 
said the inadmissible suppositions when rejected are 
soon forgotten n and thus the trace of them vanishes 
from the thoughts and the successful hypothesis alone 
holds its place in our memory but in reality many 
other transient suppositions must have been made by 
all discoverers — hypotheses which are not afterwards 
asserted as true systems but entertained for an in 
stant — ‘tentative hypotheses’ as they have been 
called each of “these hypotheses is followed by its 
corresponding train of observations from which it de 
rives its power of leading to truth the hypothesis is 



characteristics of scientific induction 

like the captain and the observations like the soldiers 
of an army while he appear sto command them and 
in this way to work his own will he does in fact derive 
all his power of conquest from their obedience and be 
comes helpless and useless if they mutiny 

since the discoverer has thus constantly to work his 
way onwards by means of hypotheses false and true 
it is highly important for him to possess talents and 
means for rapidly testing each supposition as it offers 
itself in this as in other parts of the work of disco 
very success has in general been mainly owing to the 
native ingenuity and sagacity of the discoverer’s mind 
yet some hules tending to further this object have 
been delivered by eminent philosophers and some 
others may perhaps be suggested of these we shall 
here notice only some of the most general leaving for 
a future chapter the consideration of some more 
limited and detailed processes by which in certain 
cases the discovery of the laws of nature may be 
materially assisted 


sect iii — tests of hypotheses 

 a maxim which it may be useful to recollect is 
this — that hypotheses may often he of service to science 
when they involve a certain portion of incompleteness 
and even of errour the object of such inventions is to 
bind together facts which without them arc loose and 
detached rtnd if they do this they may lead the way 
to a perception of the true rule by which the pheno 
mena are associated together even if they themselves 
somewhat misstate the matter the imagined arrange 
ment enables us to contemplate as a whole a collection 
of special cases which perplex and overload our minds 
when they are considered in succession and if our 
scheme has so much of truth in it as to conjoin what is 
really connected we may afterwards duly correct or 
limit the •mechanism of this connexion if our hypo 
thesis renders a reason for the agreement of cases 
really similar we may afterwards find this reason to be

 construction of science 

false but we sliall be able to translate it into the lan 
guage of truth 

a conspicuous example of such an hypothesis — one 
which was of the highest value to science though very 
incomplete and as a representation of nature alto 
gether false — is seen in the doctrine of epicycles by 
which the ancient astronomers explained the motions 
of the sun moon and planets this doctrine con 
nected the places and velocities of these bodies at par 
ticular times in a manner which was in its general 
features agreeable to nature yet this doctrine was 
erroneous in its assertion of the circular nature of all 
the celestial motions and in making the heavenly 
bodies revolve round the earth it was however of 
immense value to the progress of astronomical science 
for it enabled men to express and reason upon many 
important truths which they discovered respecting the 
motion of the stars up to the time of kepler indeed 
we can hardly imagine that astronomy could in its 
outset have made so great a progress under any other 
form as it did in consequence of being cultivated in 
this shape of the incomplete and false epicyclical hypo 
thesis 

 we may notice another instance of an exploded 
hypothesis which is generally mentioned only to be 
ridiculed and which undoubtedly is both false in the 
extent of its assertion and unpliilosohical in its 
expression but w t hich still in its day was not with 
out merit i mean the doctrine of natures horrour 
of a vacuum fuga vacui by which the action of 
siphons and pumps and many other phenomena were 
explained till mersenne and pascal taught a truer 
doctrine this hypothesis was of real service for it 
brought together many facts which really belong to 
the same class although they are very different in their 
first aspect a scientific writer of modern times ap 
pears to wonder that men did not at once divine the 
weigh fc of the a it from which the phenomena formerly 
ascribed to the fuga vacui really result i loaded com

pressed by tlie atmosphere’ he says ‘they did not 
recognize its action in vain all nature testified that 
air was elastic and heavy they shut their eyes to her 
testimony the water rose in pumps and flawed in 
siphons at that time as it does at this day they 
could not separate the boards of a pair of bellows of 
which the holes were stopped and they culd not 
bring together the same boards without difficulty if 
they were at first separated infants sucked the milk 
of their mothers air entered rapidly into the lungs 
of animals at every inspiration cuppingglasses pro 
ducedhumouj’s on the skin and in spite of all these 
striking proofs of the weight and elasticity of the air 
the ancient philosophers maintained resolutely that air 
was light and explained all these phenomena by the 
horrour which they said nature had for a vacuum’ 
it is curious that it should not have occurred to the 
author while writing this that if these facts so nu 
merous and various can all be accounted for one 
principle there is a strong presumption that the prin 
ciple is not altogether baseless and in reality is it 
not true that nature does abhor a vacuum and does all 
she can to avoid it no doubt this power is not un 
limited and moreover we can trace it to a mechanical 
cause the pressure of the circumambient air but the 
tendency arising from this pressure which the bodies 
surrouuding a space void of air have to rush into it 
may be expressed in no extravagant or unintelligible 
manner by saying that nature has a repugnance to a 
vacuum 

that imperfect and false hypotheses though they 
may thus explain some phenomena aiql may be useful 
in the progress of science cannot explain all pheno 
mena — and that we are never to rest in our labours 
or acquiesce in our results till we have found some 
view of the subject which is consistent with all the ob 
served facts — will of course be understood we shall 
afterwards have to speak of the other steps of such a 
progress 

 yhus the hypotheses which we accept ought to 
explain phenomena which we have observed but they 



 construction of science 

ought to do more than this our hypotheses ought to 
foretel phenomena which have not yet been observed 
at least all phenomena of the same kind as those which 
the hypothesis was invented to explain for our assent 
to the hypothesis implies that it is held to be true of all 
particular instances that these cases belong to past or 
to future times that they have or have not already 
occurred makes no difference in the applicability of the 
rule to them because the rule prevails it includes all 
cases and will determine them all if we can only cal 
culate its real consequences hence it will predict the 
results of new combinations as well as explain the ap 
pearances which have occurred in old ones and that 
it does this with certainty and correctness is one mode 
in which the hypothesis is to be verified as light and 
useful 

the scientific doctrines which have at various periods 
been established have been verified in this manner 
for example the encyclical theory of the heavens 
was confirmed by its predicting truly eclipses of the 
sup and moon configurations of the planets and other 
celestial phenomena and fey its leading to the con 
struction of tables by which the places of the heavenly 
bodies were given at every moment of time thd truth 
and accuracy of these predictions were a proof that the 
hypothesis was valuable and at least to a great extent 
true although as was afterwards found it involved a 
false representation of the structure of the heavens 
in like manner the discovery of the laws of refrac 
tion enabled mathematicians to predict by calculation 
what would be the efrect of any new form c r combina 
tion of transparent lenses newton’s hypothesis of 
fits of easy transmission and easy reflection in the 
particles of light although not confirmed by other 
kinds of facts involved a true statement of the law of 
the phenomena which it was framed to include and 
served to predict the forms and colours of thin plates 
for a wide range of given cases • the hypothesis that 
light operates by undulations and interferences af 
forded the means of predicting results under a still 
larger extent of conditions in like maimer in the 



characteristics of scientific induction 

progress of chemical knowledge the doctrine of phlo 
giston supplied the means of foreseeing the consequence 
of many combinations of elements even before they 
were tried but the oxygen theory besides affording 
predictions at least equally exact with regard to the 
general results of chemical operations included all the 
facts concerning the relations of weight of the elements 
and their compounds and enabled chemists to foresee 
such facts in untried cases and the theory of electro 
magnetic forces as soon as it was rightly understood 
enablejl those who had mastered it to predict notions 
such as had ifot been before observed which were ac 
cordingly foiled to take place 

men cannot help believing that £he laws laid down 
by discoverers must be in a great measure identical 
with the real laws of nature when the discoverers thus 
determine effects beforehand in the same manner in 
which nature herself determines them when the occa 
sion occurs those who can do this must to a con 
siderable extent have detected nature’s secret — must 
have fixed upon the conditions to which she attend 
and must have seized the rules by which she applies 
them jsuch a coincidence of untried facts with specu 
lative assertions cannot be the work of chance but im 
plies some large portion of truth in the principles on 
which the reasoning is founded to trace order anj 
law in that which has been observed may be considered 
as interpreting what nature has written down for us 
and will commonly prove that we understand her 
alphabet but to predict what hanot been observed 
is to attemjft ourselves to use the legislative phrases of 
nature aud when she responds plainly and precisely 
to that which we thus utter we cannot but suppose 
that we have in a great measure made ourselves masters 
of the meaning and structure of her language the 
prediction of results even of the same kind as those 
which have been observed in new cases is a proof of 
real success in oiir indifetive processes 

 we have here spoken of the prediction of 
facts of the same kind as those from which our rule 
was collected but the evidence in favour of our 



 


construction of science 


induction is of a much higher and more forcible cha 
racter when it enables us to explain and determine 
cases of a kind different from those which were con 
templated in the formation of our hypothesis the 
instances in which this has occurred indeed impress 
us with a conviction that the truth of our hypothesis 
is certain no accident could give rise to such an 
extraordinary coincidence no false supposition could 
after being adjusted to one class of phenomena exactly 
represent a different class where the agreement was 
unforeseen and uncontemplated that rules springing 
from remote and unconnected quarter should thus 
leap to the same point can only arise fim that being 
the point where truth resides 

accordingly the cases in which inductions from 
classes of facts altogether different have thus jumped 
together belong only to the best established theories 
which the history of science contains and as i shall 
have occasion to refer to this peculiar feature in their 
evidence i will take the liberty of describing it by a 
particular phrase and will term it the consilience of 
inductions 

it is exemplified principally in some of the greatest 
discoveries thus it was found by newton that the 
doctrine of the attraction of the sun varying accord 
ing to the inverse square of this distance which ex 
plained kepler’s third law of the proportionality of 
the cubes of the distances to the squares of the periodic 
times of the planets explained also his first and 
second laws of the elliptical motion of each planet 
although no connexion of these laws had been visible 
before again it appeared that the force of universal 
gravitation which had been inferred from the pertur 
bations of the moon and planets by the sun and by 
each other also accounted for the fact apparently 
altogether dissimilar and remote of the precession of 
the equinoxes here was a most striking and sur 
prising coincidence which gave to the theory a stamp 
of truth beyond the power of ingenuity to counterfeit 
in like manner in optics the hypothesis of alternate 
fits of easy transmission and reflection would explain 



characteristics of scientific induction 

the colours of thin plates and indeed was devised and 
adjusted for that very purpose hut it could give no 
account of the phenomena of the fringes of shadows 
but the doctrine of interferences constructed at first 
with reference to phenomena of the nature of the 
fringes explained also the colours of thin plates better 
than the supposition of the fits invented for fchat very 
purpose and we have in physical optics another 
example of the same kind which is quite as striking 
as the explanation of precession by inferences from the 
facts of perturbation the doctrine of undulations 
propagated ih a spheroidal form was contrived at first 
by huyghens with a view to explain the laws of 
double refraction in calcspar and was pursued with 
the same view by fresnel but in thh course of the 
investigation it appeared in a most unexpected and 
wonderful manner that this same doctrine of sphe 
roidal undulations when it was so modified as to 
account for the directions of the two refracted rays 
accounted also for the positions of their planes of 
polarization a phenomenon which taken by itself 
it had perplexed previoife mathematicians even to 
represent 

the theory of universal gravitation and of the 
undulatory theory of light are indeed full of exam 
ples of this consilience of inductions with regard to 
the latter it has been justly asserted by herscliel that 
the history of the undulatory theory was a succession 
of felicities h and it is precisely the unexpected coin 
cidences of results drawn from distant parts of the 
subject which are properly thus described thus the 
laws of the modification of polarization to which 
fresnel was led by his general views accounted for 
the buie respecting the angle at which light is polar 
ized discovered by sir d brewster the concep 
tions of the theory pointed out peculiar modifications 
of the phenomena when newtons rings were produced

tained to take place in fact by arago and airy 
when the beautiful phenomena of dipolarized light 
were discovered by arago and biot young was able 
to declare that they were reducible to the general laws 
of interference which he had already established 
and what was no less striking a confirmation of the 
truth of the theory measures of the same element 
deduced from various classes of facts were found to 
coincide thus the length of a luminiferous undu 
lation calculated by young from the measurement of 
fringes of shadows was found to agree very yearly 
with the previous calculation from the colours of thin 
plates 

no example can be pointed out in the whole his 
tory of science so far as i am aware in which this 
consilience of inductions has given testimony in 
favour of an hypothesis afterwards discovered to be 
false if we take one class of facts only knowing the 
law which they follow we may construct an hypothe 
sis or perhaps several which may represent them 
and as new circumstances are discovered we may often 
adjust the hypothesis so as to correspond to these also 
but when the hypothesis of itself and without adjust 
ment for the purpose gives us the rule and reason of a 
class of facts not contemplated in its construction we 
have a criterion of its reality which has never yet 
been produced in favour of falsehood 

 in the preceding article i have spoken of the 
hypothesis with which we compare our facts as being 
framed all at once eph of its parts being included in 
the original scheme in reality however it bften hap 
pens that the various suppositions which our system 
contains are added upon occasion of different re 
searches thus in the ptolemaic doctrine of the hea 
vens new epicycles and eccentrics were added as new 
inequalities of the motions of the heavenly bodies were 
discovered and in the newtonian doctrine of mate 
rial rays of light the supposition that these rays had

 fits’ was added to explain the colours of thin plates 
and the supposition that they had sides’ was intro 
duced on occasion of the phenomena of polarization 
in like manner other theories have been built up of 
parts devised at different times 

this being the mode in which theories are often 
framed we have to notice a distinction which fa found 
to prevail in the progress of true and false theories 
in the former class all the additional suppositions tend 
to simplicity and harmony the new suppositions re 
solve themselves into the old ones or at least require 
only stane eay modification of the hypothesis first 
assumed the system becomes more coherent as it is 
further extended the elements which we require for 
explaining a new class of facts are already contained 
in our system different members of the theory run 
together and we have thus a constant convergence to 
unity in false theories the contrary is the case the 
new suppositions are something altogether additional 
— not suggested by the original scheme perhaps diffi 
cult to reconcile with it every such addition adds to 
the complexity of the hypothetical system which at 
last becomes unmanageable and is compelled to sur 
render fts place to some simpler explanation 

such a false theory for example was the ancient 
doctrine of eccentrics and epicycles it explained the 
general succession of the places of the sun moon 
and planets it would not have explained the pro 
portion of their magnitudes at different times if these 
could have been accurately observed but this the an 
cient astronomers were unable to df when however 
tycho and other astronomers came to t be able to ob 
serve the planets accurately in all positions it was 
found that no combination of equable circular motions 
would exactly represent all the observations we may 
see in kepler’s works the many new modifications of 
the epicyclical hypothesis which offered themselves to 
him some of which wuld have agreed with the phe 
nomena with a certain degree of accuracy but no£vith 
so great a degree as kepler fortunately for the pro 
gress of science insisted upon obtaining after these 



 construction of science 

epicycles had been thus accumulated they all dis 
appeared and gave way to the simpler conception of an 
elliptical motion in like manner the discovery of new 
inequalities in the moon’s motions encumbered her 
system more and more with new machinery which was 
at last rejected all at once in favour o£ the elliptical 
theory astronomers could not but suppose them 
selves in a wrong path when the prospect grew darker 
and more entangled at every step 

again the cartesian system of vortices might be 
said to explain the primary phenomena of the revolu 
tions of planets about the sun and satellites about 
planets but the elliptical form of the orbits required 
new suppositions ¦ bernoulli ascribed this curve to the 
shape of the planet operating on the stream of the 
vortex in a manner similar to the rudder of a boat 
but then the motions of the aphelia and of the nodes 
— the perturbations — even the action of gravity to 
wards the earth — could not be accounted for without 
new and independent suppositions here was none of 
the simplicity of truth the theory of gravitation 
on the other hand became more simple as the facts to 
be explained became more numerous the attraction 
of the sun accounted for the motions of the jilanets 
the attraction of the planets was the cause of the mo 
tion of the satellites but this being assumed the 
perturbations and the motions of the nodes and aphelia 
only made it requisite to extend the attraction of the 
sun to the satellites and that of the planets to each 
other — the tides the spheroidal form of the earth 
the precession stilt required nothing more than that 
the moon and sun should attract the parts of the earth 
and that these should attract each other — so that 
all the suppositions resolved themselves into the single 
one of the universal gravitation of all matter it is 
difficult to imagine a more convincing manifestation bf 
simplicity and unity 

again to take an example from another science — 
the doctrine of phlogiston brought together many facts 
in a very plausible manner — combustion acidification 
and others — and very naturally prevailed for a while 



characteristics of scientific induction 

but the balance came to be used in chemical opera 
tions and the facts of weight as well as of combination 
were to be accounted for on the phlogistic theory it 
appeared that this could not be done without a new 
supposition £nd that a very strange one — that phlo 
giston was an element not only not heavy jwit ab 
solutely light so that it diminished the weight of the 
compounds into which it entered some chemists for a 
time adopted this extravagant view but the wiser of 
them saw in the necessity of such a supposition to the 
defendb of th theory an evidence that the hypothesis 
of an element phlogiston was erroneous and the 
opposite hypothesis which taught that oxygen was 
subtracted and not phlogiston added was accepted 
because it required no such novel and inadmissible 
assumption 

again we find the same evidence of truth in the 
progress of the undulatory theory of light in the 
course of its application from one class of facts to an 
other thus we explain reflection and refraction by 
undulations when we com to thin plates the requi 
site ‘ fits’ are already involved in our fundamental 
hypothesis for they are the length of an undulation 
the phenomena of diffraction also require such inter 
vals and the intervals thus required agree exactly 
with the others in magnitude so that no new property 
is needed polarization for a moment appears to re 
quire some new hypothesis yet this is hardly the case 
for the direction of our vibrations is hitherto arbitrary 
— we allo polarization to decide it and we suppose 
the undulations to be transverse having done this 
for the sake of polarization we turn to the phenomena 
of double refraction and inquire what new hypothesis 
they require but the answer is that they require 
none the supposition of transverse vibrations which 
we have made in order to explain polarization gives 
us also the law of double refraction truth may give 
rise to such a coincidence falsehood cannot lgain 
the facf£ of dipolarization come info view but they 
hardly require any new assumption for the difference 
of optical elasticity of crystals in different directions

which is already assumed in uniaxal crystals is ex 
tended to biaxal exactly according to the law of sym 
metry • and this being done the laws of the pheno 
mena curious and complex as they are are fully 
explained the phenomena of circular polarization 
by internal reflection instead of requiring a new hypo 
thesis are found to be given by an interpretation of 
an apparently inexplicable result of an old hypothesis 
the circular polarization of quartz and its double 
refraction does indeed appear to require a new assump 
tion but still not one which at all disturbs thb form 
of the theory and in short the whole history of this 
theory is a progress constant and steady often striking 
and startling from one degree of evidence and consist 
ence to another of a higher order 

in the emission theory on the other hand as in 
the theory of solid epicycles we see what we may 
consider as the natural course of things in the career 
of a false theory such a theory may to a certain 
extent explain the phenomena which it was at first 
contrived to meet but evey new class of facts requires 
a new supposition — an addition to the machinery and 
as observation goes on these incoherent appendages 
accumulate till they overwhelm and upset the original 
ramework such lias been the hypothesis of the 
material emission of light in its original form it 
explained reflection and refraction but the colours 
of thin plates added to it the fits of easy transmis 
sion and reflection the phenomena of diffraction 
further invested the emitted particles with complex 
laws of attraction and repulsion polarization gave 
them sides double refraction subjected them to 
peculiar forces emanating from the axes of the crystal 
anally dipolarization loaded them with the complex 
and unconnected contrivance of moveable polarization

mechanism was wanting there is here no unexpected 
success no happy coincidence no convergence of prin

the machine hut its parts do not fit they hold 
together only while he presses them this is not the 
character of truth 

as another example of the application of the maxim 
now under consideration i may perhaps be allowed to 
refer to the judgment which in the history of ther 
motics i have ventured to give respecting £aplace’s 
theory of gases i have stated that we cannot help 
forming an unfavourable judgment of this theory by 
looking for that great characteristic oftrue theory 
namely that the hypotheses which were assumed to 
account for sne class of facts are found to explain 
another class of a different nature thus laplace’s first 
suppositions explain the connexion of compression 
with density the law of boyle and mariotte and 
the connexion of elasticity with heat the law of 
dalton and gay lussac but the theory requires 
other assumptions when we come to latent heat and 
yet these new assumptions produce no effect upon the 
calculations in any application of the theory when 
the hypothesis constructed with reference to the elas 
ticity and temperature is applied to another class of 
fact those of latent heat we have no simplification 
of the hypothesis and therefore no evidence of the 
truth of the theory 

 the last two sections of this chapter direct our 
attention to two circumstances which tend to prove in 
a manner which we may term irresistible the truth of 
the theories which they characterize — the consilience 
of inductions from different and separate classes of 
facts — andtlie progressive simplification of the theory 
as it is extended to new cases these two characters 
are in fact hardly different they are exemplified by 
the same cases for if these inductions collected from 
one class of facts supply an unexpected explanation of 
a new class which is the case first spoken of there 
will be no need for new machinery in the hypothesis 
to apply it to the newlycontemplated facts andihus 
we have a case in which the system does not become 


 hist ind sc b x c iv 



g construction of science 

more complex when its application is extended to a 
wider field which was the character of true theory 
in its second aspect the consiliences of our induc 
tions give rise to a constant convergence of our theory 
towards simplicity and unity 

but moreover both these cases of the extension of 
the theory without difficulty or new suppositions to a 
wider range and to new classes of phenomena may be 
conveniently considered in yet another point of view 
namely as successive steps by which we gradually 
ascend in our speculative views to a higher and jbigher 
point of generality for when the thebry either by 
the concurrence of two indications or by an extension 
without complication has included a new range of 
phenomena we have in fact a new induction of a 
more general kind to which the inductions formerly 
obtained are subordinate as particular cases to a gene 
ral proposition we have in such examples in short 
an iiistance of successive generalization this i a sub 
ject of great importance and deserving of being well 
illustrated it will come under our notice in the next 
chapter ’ 



chapter yi 


of the logic of induction 


aphorism xyii 

the logic of induction consists in stating the facts and 
the inference in such a manner that the evidence of the in 
ference is manifest just as the logic of deduction consists 
in stating the premises and the conclusion in such a manner 
that the evidence of the conclusion is manifest 

aphorism xyiii 

the logic of deduction is exhibited by means of a certain 
formula namely a syllogism f and every tgain of deductive 
reasoning to be demonstrative must be capable of resolution 
into a series of such formulae legitimately constructed in 
like manner the logic of induction may be exhibited by 
means of certain formula and every train of inductive in 
ference to be sound must be capable of resolution into a 
scheme of such formulae legitimately constructed 

aphorism xix 

the inductive act of thought by which several facts are 
colligated into one proposition may be expressed by saying 
the several facts are exactly expressed as one fact if 
and only if we adopt the conceptions and the assertion 
of the proposition 


aphorism xx 

the one •fact thus inductively obtained from several 
facts may be combined with other facts and colligated 
with them by a new act of induction this process may be 
nov orgt 



construction of science 


 

indefinitely repeated and these successive processes are the 
steps of induction or of generalization from the lowest to 
the highest 

aphorism xxi 

the relation of the successive steps of induction may he 
exhibited by means of an inductive table in which the 
several facts are indicated and tied together by a bracket 
and the inductive inference placed on the other side of the 
bracket and this arrangement repeated so as to form a 
genealogical table of each induction from the lowest to the 
highest 

aphorism xxii 

the logic of induction is the criterion of truth inferred 
from facts as the logic of deduction is the criterion of 
truth deduced from necessary principles the inductive 
table enables us to apply such a criterion for we can de 
termine whether each induction is verified and justified by 
the facts which its bracket includes and if each induction 
in particular be sound the highest which merely combines 
them all must necessarily be sound also 

aphorism xxiii 

the distinction of fact and theory is only relative 
events and phenomena considered as particulars which may 
be colligated by induction are facts considered as generali 
ties already obtained by colligation of other facts they are 
theories the same event or phenomenon is a fact or a 
theory according as it is considered as standing on one side 
or the other of the inductive bracket 

 ftihe subject to which the present chapter refers 

a is described by phrases which are at the present 
day ‘ lamiliarly used in speaking of the progress of 
knowledge we hear very frequent mention of as 
cending from particular to general propositions and 
from these to propositions still more general — of 



the logic of induction 


 


truths included in other truths of a higher degree of 
generality — of different stages of generalization — 
and of the highest step of the process of discovery to 
which all others are subordinate and preparatory as 
these expressions so familiar to our ears especially 
since the time of francis bacon denote verysignifi 
eantly processes and relations which are of great im 
portance in the formation of science it is necessary for 
us to give a clear account of them illustrated with 
general exemplifications and this we shall endeavour 
to do 

we have indeed already explained that science con 
sists of propositions which include tlte facts from which 
they were collected and other wider propositions col 
lected in like manner from the former and including 
them thus that the stars the moon the sun rise 
culminate and set are facts included in the proposition 
that the heavens carrying with them all the celestial 
bodies have a diurnal revolution about the axis of the 
earth again the observed monthly motions of the 
moon and the annual motions of the sun are included 
in certaiu propositions concerning the movements of 
those kiminaries with respect to the stars but all 
these propositions are really included in the doctrine 
that the earth revolving on its axis moves round tli 
sun and the moon round the earth these move 
ments again considered as facts are explained and 
included in the statement of the forces which the earth 
exerts upon the moon and the sun upon the earth 
again this doctrine of the forces of these three bodies 
is included in the assertion that all the bodies of the 
solar system and all parts of matter exert forces each 
upon each and we might easily show that all the 
leading facts in astronomy are comprehended in the 
same generalization in like manner with regard to 
any other science so far as its truths have been well 
established and fully developed we might how tjpt it 
consists of a gradation of propositions proceeding from 
the most special facts to the most general theoretical 
assertions we shall exhibit this gradation in some of 
the principal branches of science 


— 



ioo 


construction of science 


 this gradation of truths successively included 

in other truths may be conveniently represented by 
tables resembling the genealogical tables by which the 
derivation of descendants from a common ancestor is 
exhibited except that it is proper in this case to in 
vert thuform of the table and to make it converge to 
unity downwards instead of upwards since it has for 
its purpose to express not the derivation of many from 
one but the collection of one truth from many things 
two or more coordinate facts or propositions may be 
ranged side by side and joined by soma mark bf con 
nexion a bracket as s — v — or v beneath 

which may be placed the more general proposition 
which is collected by induction from the former again 
propositions coordinate with this more general one 
may be placed on a level with it and the combination 
of these and the result of the combination may be 
indicated by brackets in the same manner and so on 
through any number of gradations by this means 
the streams of knowledge from various classes of facts 
will constantly run together into a smaller and smaller 
number of channels like the confluent rivulets of a 
great river coming together from many sources uniting 
their ramifications so as to form larger branches these 
again uniting in a single trunk the genealogical tree 
of each great portion of science thus formed will 
contain all the leading truths of the science arranged 
in their due coordination and subordination such 
tables constructed for the sciences of astronomy and 
of optics will be given at the end of this chapter 

 the union of coordinate propositions into a pro 
position of a higher order which occurs in this tree of 
science wherever two twigs unite in one branch is in 
each case an example of induction the single pro 
position is collected by the process of induction from 
its several members but here we may observe that 
the image of a mere union of the parts at each of these 
points which the figure of a tree or a river presents is 
very inadequate to convey the true state of the case 
for in induction as we have seen besides mere collec 
tion of particulars there is always a new conception a 



the logic of inittjction 


ioi 


principle of connexion and unity supplied by the 
mind and superinduced upon the particulars there 
is not merely a juxtaposition of materials by which 
the new proposition contains all that its component 
parts contained but also a formative act exerted by 
the understanding so that these materials ae con 
tained in a new shape we must remember there 
fore that our inductive tables although they repre 
sent the elements and the order of these inductive 
steps do not fully represent the whole signification of 
the process in each case 

 the principal features of the progress of science 
spoken of in the last chapter are learly exhibited in 
these tables namely the consilience inductions 

and the constant tendency to simplicity observable in 
true theories indeed in all cases in which from pro 
positions of considerable generality propositions of a 
still higher degree are obtained there is a convergence 
of inductions and if in one of the lines which thus 
converge the steps be rapidly and suddenly made in 
order to meet the other lin we may consider that we 
have an example of consilience thus when newton 
had collected from kepler’s laws the central force of 
the sun and from these combined with other facts 
the universal force of all the heavenly bodies btt 
fsuddenly turned round to include in his generalization 
the precession of the equinoxes which he declared to 
arise from the attraction of the sun and moon upon 
the protuberant part of the terrestrial spheroid the 
apparent remoteness of this fact innts nature from the 
other facts with which he thus associated it causes this 
part of his reasoning to strike us as a remarkable ex 
ample of consilience accordingly in the table of 
astronomy we find that the columns which contain 
the facts and theories relative to the sun and placets 
after exhibiting several stages of induction within 
themselves are at leigth suddenly connected with 
a column till theft quite distinct containing the pre 
cession of the equinoxes in like manner in the table 
of optics the columns which contain the facts and 
theories relative to double r ef r action and those which 



 construction of science 

include polarization by crystals each go separately 
through several stages of induction and then these 
two sets of columns are suddenly connected by fres 
nel’s mathematical induction that double refraction and 
polarization arise from the same cause thus exhibit 
ing a remarkable consilience 

 the constant tendency to simplicity in the 
sciences of which the progress is thus represented 
appears from the form of the table itself for the 
single trunk into which all the branches converge 
contains in itself the substance of all the propositions 
by means of which this last generalization was arrived 
at it is true that this ultimate result is sometimes 
not so simple as in the table it appears for instance 
the ultimate generalization of the table exhibiting the 
progress of physical optics — namely that light con 
sists in undulations — must be understood as includ 
ing soine other hypotheses as that the undulations 
are transverse that the ether through which they are 
propagated has its elasticity in crystals and other 
transparent bodies regulated by certain laws and the 
like yet still even acknowledging all the complica 
tion thus implied the table in question evidences 
clearly enough the constant advance towards unity 
•consistency and simplicity which have marked the 
progress of this theory the same is the case in the 
inductive table of astronomy in a still greater 
degree 

 these tables naturally afford the opportunity of 
assigning to each bf the distinct steps of which the 
progress of science consists the name of the dis 
coverer to whom it is due every one of the inductive 
processes which the brackets of our tables mark 
directs our attention to some person by whom the in 
duction was first distinctly made these names i 
have endeavoured to put in their due places in the 
tables and the inductive tree of our knowledge in 
eacli science becomes in this way an exhibition of the 
claims of each discoverer to distinction and as it 
were a genealogical tree of scientific nobility it is 
by no means pretended that such a tree includes the 



the logic of induction 


 


names of all the meritorious labourers in each depart 
ment of science many persons are most usefully 
employed in collecting and verifying truths who do 
not advance to any new truths the labours of a 
number of such are included in each stage of our 
ascent but such tables as we have now lfore us 
will present to us the names of all the most eminent 
discoverers for the main steps of which the progress 
of science consists are transitions from more particu 
lar to more general truths and must therefore be 
rightly given by these tables and those must be the 
greatest names in science to whom the principal events 
of its advance are thus due 

 the tables as we have presented them exhibit 
the course by which we pass from particular to general 
through various gradations and so to the most general 
they display the order of discovery but by reading 
them in an inverted manner beginning at the single 
comprehensive truths with which the tables end and 
tracing these back into the more partial truths and 
these again into special fycts they answer another 
purpose — they exhibit the process of verification of 
discoveries once made for each of our general pro 
positions is true in virtue of the truth of the narrower 
propositions which it involves and we cannot satisfy 
•ourselves of its truth in any other way than by ascer 
taining that these its constituent elements are true 
to assure ourselves that the sun attracts the planets 
with forces varying inversely as the square of the dis 
tance we ipust analyse by geometry the motion of a 
body in an ellipse about the focus so as to see that such 
a motion does imply such a force we must also verify 
those calculations hy which the observed places of each 
planet are stated to be included in an ellipse these cal 
culations involve assumptions respecting the path which 
the earth describes about the sun which assumptions 
must again be verified jby reference to observation and 
thus proceeding from step to step we resolve the most 
general truths into their constituent parts and these 
again into their parts and by testing at each step both 
the reality of the asserted ingredients and the propriety 



 construction of science 

of the conjunction we establish the whole system of 
truths however wide and various it may be 

 it is a very great advantage in such a mode of 
exhibiting scientific truths that it resolves the verifi 
cation of the most complex and comprehensive theories 
into a qumber of small steps of which almost any one 
falls within the reach of common talents and industry 
that if the particulars of any one step be true the 
generalization also is true any person with a mind 
properly disciplined may satisfy himself by a little 
study that each of these particular propositions is 
true may be ascertained by the same kind of atten 
tion when this prpposition is resolved into its consti 
tuent and mare special propositions and thus we 
may proceed till the most general truth is broken up 
into small and manageable portions of these por 
tions each may appear by itself narrow and easy and 
yet they are so woven together by hypothesis and con 
junction that the truth of the parts necessarily assures 
us of the truth of the whole the verification is of 
the same nature as the verification of a large and com 
plex statement of great sums received by a mercantile 
office on various accounts from many quartern the 
statement is separated into certain comprehensive heads 
rnd these into others less extensive and these again 
into smaller collections of separate articles each of® 
which can be inquired into and reported on by separate 
persons and thus at last the mere addition of 
numbers performed by these various persons and the 
summation of the results which they obtayi executed 
by other accountants is a complete and entire security 
that there is no errour in the whole of the process 

 this comparison of the process by which wo 
verify scientific truth to the process of bookkeeping 
in a large commercial establishment may appear to 
some persons not sufficiently dignified for the subject 
but in fact the possibility of giving this formal and 
businesslike aspect to the evidence of science as in 
volved in the process of successive generalization is an 
inestimable advantage for if no one could pronounce 
concerning a wide and profound theory except he who 



the logic of induction 


 


could at once embrace in bis mind the whole range of 
inference extending from the special facts up to the 
most general principles none hut the greatest geniuses 
would be entitled to judge concerning the truth or 
errour of scientific discoveries but in reality we 
seldom need to verify more than one or two steps of 
such discoveries at one time and this may commonly 
be done when the discoveries have been fully esta 
blished and developed by any one who brings to the 
task clear conceptions and steady attention the pro 
gresstof science is gradual the discoveries which are 
successively made are also verified successively we 
have never any very large collections of them on our 
hands at once the doubts and uncertainties of any 
one who has studied science with care and perseverance 
are generally confined to a few points if he can 
satisfy himself upon these he has no misgivings re 
specting the rest of the structure which has indeed 
been repeatedly verified by other persons in like man 
ner the fact that science is capable of being resolved 
into separate processes of verification is that which 
renders it possible to form a great body of scientific 
truth by adding together a vast number of truths of 
which many men at various times and by multiplied 
efforts have satisfied themselves the treasury 
science is constantly rich and abundant because it 
accumulates the wealth which is thus gathered by so 
many and reckoned over by so many more and the 
dignity of knowledge is no more lowered by the mul 
tiplicity o£ the tasks on which her servants are em 
ployed and the narrow field of labour to which some 
confine themselves than the rich merchant is degraded 
by the number of offices which it is necessary for him 
to maintain and the minute articles of which he re 
quires an exact statement from his accountants 

 the analysis of doctrines inductively obtained 
into their constituent facts and the arrangement of 
them in such a form that the conclusiveness of the in 
duction may be distinctly seen ffiay be termed the 
logic of induction by logic has generally been 
meant a system which teaches us so to arrange our 



io 


construction of science 


reasonings that their truth or falsehood shall be evi 
dent in their form in deductive reasonings in which 
the general principles aye assumed and the question is 
concerning their application and combination in parti 
cular cases the device which thus enables us to judge 
whether our reasonings are conclusive is the syllogism 
and this m form along with the rules which belong to it 
does in fact supply us with a criterion of deductive or 
demonstrative reasoning the inductive table such 
as it is presented in the present chapter in like manner 
supplies the means of ascertaining the truth o£ our 
inductive inferences so far as the form in which our 
reasoning may be stated can afford such a criterion of 
course some care is requisite in order to reduce a train 
of demonstration into the form of a series of syllogisms 
and certainly not less thought and attention are re 
quired for resolving all the main doctrines of any great 
department of science into a graduated table of co 
ordinate and subordinate inductions but in each 
case when this task is once executed the evidence or 
want of evidence of our conclusions appears immedi 
ately in a most luminous manner in each step of 
induction our table enumerates the particular faets 
and states the general theoretical truth which includes 
tjjese and which these constitute the special act of 
attention by which we satisfy ourselves that the facts 
are so included — that the general truth is so consti 
tuted — then affords little room for errour with 
moderate attention and clearness of thought 

ii we may find an example of this act of atten 
tion thus required at any one of the steps ol induction 
in our tables for instance at the step in the early 
progress of astronomy at which it was inferred that 
the earth is a globe and that the sphere of the heavens 
relatively performs a diurnal revolution round this 
globe of the earth itow was this established in the be 
lief of the greeks and how is it fixed in our conviction 
as todihe globular form we find that as we travel to 
the north the apparent pole of the heavenly motions 
and the constellations which are near it seem to mount 
higher and as we proceed southwards they descend 



the logic of induction 


 


again if we proceed from two different points consi 
derably to the east and west of each other and travel 
directly northwards from each as from the south of 
spain to the north of scotland and from greece to 
scandinavia these two north and south lines will be 
much nearer to each other in their northern than in 
their southern parts these and similar facti’ as soon 
as they are clearly estimated and connected in the 
mind are seen to be consistent with a convex surface of 
the earth and with no other and this notion is further 
confijgned by observing that the boundary of the earth’s 
shadow upoil the moon is always circular it being 
supposed to be already established that the moon re 
ceives her light from the sun and that lunar eclipses 
are caused by the interposition of the earth as for 
the assertion of the relative diurnal revolution of the 
starry sphere it is merely putting the visible phenomena 
in an exact geometrical form and thus we establish and 
verify the doctrine of the revolution of the sphere of 
the heavens about the globe of the earth by contem 
plating it so as to see that it does really and exactly 
include the particular facts from which it is collected 

we may in like manner illustrate this mode of 
verification by any of the other steps of the same table 
thus if we take the great induction of copernicus the 
heliocentric scheme of the solar system we find it in tle 
table exhibited as including and explaining first the 
diurnal revolution just spoken of second the motions 
of the moon among the fixed stars third the motions 
of the planets with reference to the fixed stars and the 
sun fourth the motion of the sun in the ecliptic 
and the scheme being clearly conceived we see that all 
the particular facts are faithfully represented by it 
and this agreement along with the simplicity of the 
scheme in which respect it is so far superior to any 
other conception of the solar system persuade us that 
it is really the plan of nature 

in exactly the same way if we attend ’to any of the 
several remarkable discoveries of newton which form 
the principal steps in the latter part of the table as 
for instance the proposition that the sun attracts all 



i construction of science 

the planets with a force which varies inversely as the 
square of the distance we find it proved by its includ 
ing thre other propositions previously established — 
first that the sun’s mean force on different planets 
follows the specified variation which is t proved from 
kepler’s third law second that the force by which 
each plariet is acted upon in different parts of its orbit 
tends to the sun which is proved by the equable de 
scription of areas third that this force in different 
parts of the sme orbit is also inversely as the square 
of the distance which is proved from the elliptical 
form of the orbit and the newton iah generaliza 
tion when its consequences are mathematically traced 
is seen to agree with each of these particular proposi 
tions and thus is fully established 

 but when we say that the more general propo 
sition includes the several more particular ones we 
must recollect what has before been said that these 
particulars form the general truth not by being merely 
enumerated and added together but by being seen in a 
new light no mere verbal recitation of the particu 
lars can decide whether the general proposition is true 
a special act of thought is requisite in order to deter 
mine how truly each is included in the supposed in 
duction in this respect the inductive table is not 
like a mere schedule of accounts where the rightness 
of each part of the reckoning is tested by mere addi 
tion of the particulars on the contrary the inductive 
truth is never the mere sum of the facts it is made 
into something more by the introduction of a new 
mental element and the mind in order to be able to 
supply this element must have peculiar endowments 
and discipline thus looking back at the instances 
noticed in the last article how are we to see that a 
convex surface of the earth is necessarily implied by 
the convergence of meridians towards the north or by 
the visible descent of the north pole of the heavens as 
we travel south manifestly the student in order to 
see this must have’ clear conceptions of the relations 
of space either naturally inherent in his mind or 
established there by geometrical cultivation — by study 



the logic of induction io 

ing the properties of circles and spheres when he 
is so prepared he will feel the force of the expressions 
we have used that the facts just mentioned afe seen to 
be consistent with a globular form of the earth but 
without such aptitude he will not see this consistency 
and if this be so the mere assertion of it yi words 
will not avail him in satisfying himself of the truth of 
the proposition 

in like manner in order to perceive the force of the 
copernican induction the student must ifave his mind 
so disciplined by geometrical studies or otherwise that 
he sees clearly how absolute motion and relative motion 
would alike produce apparent motion he must have 
learnt to cast away all prejudices arising •from the seem 
ing fixity of the earth and then he will see that there 
is nothing which stands in the way of the induction 
while there is much which is on its side and in the 
same manner the newtonian induction of the law of 
the sun’s force from the elliptical form of the orbit 
will be evidently satisfactory to him only who has such 
an insight into mechanics as to see that a curvilinear 
path must arise from a constantly deflecting force 
and who is able to follow the steps of geometrical 
reasoning by which from the properties of the ellipse 
newton proves this deflection to be in the proportion 
in which he asserts the force to be and thus in all 
cases the inductive truth must indeed be verified by 
comparing it with the particular facts but then this 
comparison is possible for him only whose mind is 
properly disciplined and preparer in the use of those 
conceptions which in addition to the facts the act of 
induction requires 

 in the tables some indication is given at 
several of the steps of the act which the mind must 
thus perform besides the mere conjunction of facts in 
order to attain to the inductive truth thus in the 
cases of the newtonian inductions just spoken of the 
inferences are stated to be made by mechanics ’ 
and in jhe case of the copernican induction it is said 
that ‘ by the nature of motion the apparent motion is 
the ame whether the heavens or the earth have a 



no 


construction of science 


diurnal motion and the latter is more simple but 
these verbal statements are to be understood as mere 
hints they cannot supersede the necessity of the stu 
dent’s contemplating for himself the mechanical prin 
ciples and the nature of motion thus referred to 

 jn the common or syllogistic logic a certain 
formula of language is used in stating the reasoning 
and is useful in enabling us more readily to apply the 
criterion of form to alleged demonstrations this 
formula is the usual syllogism with its members 
major premiss minor premiss and conclusion it 
may naturally be asked whether in inductive logic 
there is any such formula whether there is any 
standard form of words in which we may most pro 
perly express the inference of a general truth from 
particular facts 

at first it might be supposed that the formula of 
inductive logic need only be of this kind ‘ these 
particulars and all known particulars of the same 
kind are exactly included in the following general 
proposition but a moment’s reflection on what has 
just been said will show us that this is not sufficient 
for the particulars are not merely included in the 
general proposition it is not enough that they apper 
tain to it by enumeration it is for instance no ade 
quate example of induction to say mercury describes 
an elliptical path so does venus so do the earth 
mars jupiter saturn uijanus therefore all the 
planets describe elliptical paths’ this is as we have 
seen the mode of stating the evidence when the propo 
sition is once suggested but the inductive step con 
sists in the suggestion of a conception not before 
apparent when kepler after trying to connect the 
observed places of the planet mars in many other 
ways found at last that the conception of an ellipse 
would include them all he obtained a truth by induc 
tion for this conclusion was not obviously included 
in the phenomena and had not been applied to these 


¦ in the inductive tables they axe marked by an asterisk 



the logic of induction 


ill 


facts previously thus in our formula besides stating 
that the particulars are included in the general propo 
sition we must also imply that the generality is consti 
tuted by a new conception — new at least in its 
application 

hence our inductive formula might be sojnething 
like the following ‘ these particulars and all known 
particulars of the same kind are exactly expressed by 
adopting the conceptions and statement of the follow 
ing proposition’ it is of course requisite that the 
conceptions should be perfectly clear and should pre 
cisely embrace the facts according to the explanation 
we have already given of those conditions 

 it may happen as we have already stated that 
the explication of a conception by which it acquires 
its due distinctness leads to a definition which defi 
nition may be taken as the summary and total result 
of the intellectual efforts to which this distinctness is 
due in such cases the formula of induction may be 
modified according to this condition and we may state 
the inference by saying fter an enumeration and 
analysis of the appropriate facts ‘these facts are 
completely and distinctly expressed by adopting the 
following definition and proposition’ 

this formula has been adopted in stating the in 
luctivc propositions which constitute the basis of the 
science of mechanics in a work intitled the mecha 
nical euclid the fundamental truths of the subject 
are expressed in inductive fairs of assertions con 
sisting eachof a definition and a proposition such as 
the following 

def — a uniform force is that which acting in the 
direction of the body’s motion adds or subtracts equal 
velocities in equal times 

prop — gravity is a uniform force 

again 

def — two motions are compounded when each 
produces its separate effect in a direction parallel to 
itself 

prop — when any force acts upon a body in mo 
tion the motion which the force would produce in the 



 


construction of science 


body at rest is compounded with the previous motion 
of the body 

and mi like manner in other cases 

in these cases the proposition is of course esta 
blished and the definition realized by an enumeration 
of the facts and in the case of inferences made in 
such a form the definition of the conception and the 
assertion of the truth are both requisite and are cor 
relative to one another each of the two steps con 
tains the verification and justification of the other 
the proposition derives its meaning from the defini 
tion the definition derives its reality from the pro 
position if they are separated the definition is arbi 
trary or empty the proposition vague or ambiguous 

 but it must be observed that neither of the 
preceding formulae expresses the full cogency of the 
inductive proof they declare only that the results 
can be clearly explained and rigorously deduced by the 
employment of a certain definition and a certain pro 
position but in order to make the conclusion demon 
strative which in perfect examples of induction it is 
we ought to be able to declare that the results can be 
clearly explained and rigorously declared only by the 
definition and proposition which we adopt and in 
•ideality the conviction of the sound inductive reasoner 
does reach to this point the mathematician asserts 
the laws of motion seeing clearly that they or laws 
equivalent to them afford the only means of clearly 
expressing and deducing the actual facts but this 
conviction that th inductive inference is not only 
consistent with the facts but necessary finds its place 
in the mind gradually as the contemplation of the 
consequences of the proposition and the various rela 
tions of the facts becomes steady and familiar it 
is scarcely possible for the student at once to satisfy 
himself that the inference is thus inevitable and 
when he arrives at this conviction he sees also in 
many cases at least that there may be other ways of 
expressing the substance of the truth established 
besides that special proposition which he has under 
his notice 



the logic op inrfcjction 


 

we may therefore without impropriety renounce 
the undertaking of conveying in our formula this final 
conviction of the necessary truth of our inference we 
may leave it to be thought without insisting upon say 
ing it that in such cases what can be true is true 
but if we wish to express the ultimate significance of 
the inductive act of thought we may take as our 
formula for the colligation of facts by induction 
this — ‘ the several facts are exactly expressed as one 
fact if and only if we adopt the conception and the 
assertion of the inductive inference 

 i have said that the mind must be properly 
disciplined in order that it may see the necessary con 
nexion between the facts and the geneil proposition 
in which they are included and the perception of 
this connexion though treated as one step in our 
inductive inference may imply many steps of demon 
strative proof the connexion is this that the parti 
cular case is included in the general one that is may 
be deduced from it but this deduction may often 
require many links of reasoning thus in the case of 
the inference of the law of the force from the elliptical 
fornf of the orbit by newton the proof that in the 
ellipse the deflection from the tangent is inversely as 
the square of the distance from the focus of the ellipse 
is a ratiocination consisting of several steps and in 
volving several properties of conic sections these pro 
perties being supposed to be previously established by 
a geometrical system of demonstration on the special 
subject of tjie conic sections ih this and similar 
cases the induction involves many steps of deduction 
and in such cases afthough the inductive step the 
invention of the conception is really the most im 
portant yet since when once made it occupies a 
familiar place in men’s minds and since the deductive 
demonstration is of considerable length and requires 
intellectual effort to follow it at every step men often 
admire the deductive part of the proposition the ’geo 
metrical or algebraical demonstration far more than 
that part in which the philosophical merit really resides

 deductive reasoning is virtually a collection of 
syllogisms as has already been stated and in such 
reasoning the general principles the definitions and 
axioms necessarily stand at the beginning of the 
demonstration in an inductive infereuce the defi 
nitionsand principles are the final remit of the reason 
ing the ultimate effect of the proof hence when an 
inductive proposition is to be established by a proof 
involving several steps of demonstrative reasoning the 
enunciation of the proposition will contain explicitly 
or implicitly principles which the demonstration pro 
ceeds upon as axioms but which are really inductive 
inferences thus in order to prove that the force 
which retains a planet in an ellipse varies inversely as 
the square of the distance it is taken for granted that 
the laws of motion are true and that they apply to 
the planets yet the doctrine that this is so as well 
as the law of the force were established only by this and 
the like demonstrations the doctrine which is the 
hypothesis of the deductive reasoning is the inference 
of the inductive process the special facts which are 
the basis of the inductive inference are the conclusion 
of the train of deduction and in this manner the 
deduction establishes the induction the principle 
which we gather from the facts is true because the 
facts can be derived from it by rigorous demonstratior 
induction moves upwards and deduction downwards 
on the same stair 

but still there is a great difference in the character 
of their movements deduction descend steadily and 
methodically step by step induction mounts by a 
leap which is out of the reach s“ method she bounds 
to the top of the stair at once and then it is the busi 
ness of deduction by trying each step in order to 
establish the solidity of her companion’s footing yet 
these must be processes of the same mind the in 
ductive intellect makes an assertion which is subse 
quently justified by demonstration and it shows its 
sagacity its peculiar character by enunciating the 
proposition when as yet the demonstration does not 



the logic of induction 

exist but then it shows that it is sagacity by also 
producing the demonstration 

it has been said that inductive and deductive reason 
ing are contrary in their scheme that in deduction 
we infer particular from general truths while in in 
duction we infer general from particular that deduc 
tion consists of many steps in each of which we apply 
known general propositions in particular cases while 
in induction we have a single step in which we pass 
from many particular truths to one general propo 
sition and this is truly said but though contrary 
in their motions the two are the operation of the same 
mind travelling over the same groiyid deduction is 
a necessary part of induction deduction justifies by 
calculation what induction had happily guessed in 
duction recognizes the ore of truth by its weight 
deduction confirms the recognition by chemical ana 
lysis every step of induction must be confirmed by 
rigorous deductive reasoning followed into such detail 
as the nature and complexity of the relations whether 
of quantity or any other render requisite if not so 
justified by the supposed discoverer it is not in 
duction 

 such tabular arrangements of propositions as 
we have constructed may be considered as the criterion 
f truth for the doctrines which they include they 
are the criterion of inductive truth in the same 
sense in which syllogistic demonstration is the cri 
terion of necessary truth — of the certainty of con 
clusions depending upon evident first principles 
and that such tables are really a criterion of the 
truth of the propositions which they contain will be 
plain by examining their structure for if the con 
nexion which the inductive process assumes be ascer 
tained to be in each case real and true the assertion of 
the general proposition merely collects together ascer 
tained truths and in like manner each of those more 
particular propositions is true because it merely ex 
presses collectively more special facts so that the most 
general teeory is only the assertion of a great body 
of faefs duly classified and subordinated when we 

— 



il construction of science 

assert the truth of thecopernican theory of the motions 
of the solar system or of the newtonian theoiy of the 
forces by which they re caused we merely assert the 
groups of propositions which in the table of astrono 
mical induction are included in these doctrines and 
ultimately we may consider ourselves as merely as 
serting at once so many facts and therefore of course 
expressing an indisputable truth 

 at any one of these steps of induction in the 
table the inductive proposition is a theory with re 
gard to the facts which it includes while it ts to be 
looked upon as a fact with respect to the higher gene 
ralizations in which it is included in any other 
sense as was° formerly shown the opposition of fact 
and theory is untenable and leads to endless per 
plexity and debate is it a fact or a theory that the 
planet mars revolves in an ellipse about the sun 
to kepler employed in endeavouring to combine the 
separate observations by the conception of an ellipse 
it is a theory to newton engaged in inferring the 
law of force from a knowledge of the elliptical motion 
it is a fact there are as we have already seen no 
special attributes of theory and fact which distinguish 
them from one another facts are phenomena appre 
hended by the aid of conceptions and mental acts as 
theories also are we commonly call our observations 
facts when we apply without effort or consciousness 
conceptions perfectly familiar to us while we speak of 
theories when we have previously contemplated the 
facts and the connecting conception separately and 
have made the connexion by a conscious mental act 
the real difference is a difference of relation as the 
same proposition in a demonstration is the premiss of 
one syllogism and the conclusion in another — as the 
same person is a father and a son propositions arc 
facts and theories according as they stand above or 
belpw the inductive brackets of our tables 

 to obvirte mistakes i may remark that the 
terms higher and lower when used of generalizations 
are unavoidably represented by their opposites in our 
inductive tables the highest generalization is that 



the logic of induction 

which includes all others and this stands the lowest 
on our page because reading downwards that is the 
place which we last reach 

there is a distinction of the knowledge acquired by 
scientific induction into two kinds which is so im 
portant that we shall consider it in the succeeding 
chapter 



chapter vii 


of laws of phenomena and of causes 


aphorism xxiv 

inductive truths are of two kinds laws of phenomena 
and theories of causes it is necessary to begin in every 
science with the laws of phenomena but it is impossible that 
we should be satisfied to stop short of a theory of causes in 
physical astronomy physical optics geology and other 
sciences we have instances showing that we can make a great 
advance in inquiries after true theories of causes 

i tn the first attempts at acquiring an exact and 

x connected knowledge of the appearances and ope 
rations which nature presents men went no further 
than to learn what takes place not why it occurs 
they discovered an order which the phenomena fob 
low rules which they obey but they did not come in 
sight of the powers by which these rules are deter 
mined the causes of which this order is the effect 
thus for example they found that many of the celes 
tial motions took place as if the sun and stars were 
carried round by the revolutions of certain celestial 
spheres but what causes kept these spheres in con 
stant motion they were never able to explain in 
like manner in modem times kepler discovered that 
the planets describe ellipses before newton explained 
why they select this particular curve and describe it 
in a particular manner the laws of reflection re 
fraction dispersion and other properties of light have 
long been known the causes of these las are at 
present under discussion and the same migljt be 



of laws of phenomena and of causes 

said of many other sciences the discovery of the 
laws of phenomena is in all cases the first step in 
exact knowledge these laws may often for a long 
period constitute the whole of our science and it is 
always a matter requiring great talents and great ef 
forts to advance to a knowledge of the cause of the 
phenomena 

hence the larger part of our knowledge of nature 
at least of the certain portion of it consists of the 
knowledge of the laws of phenomena in astronomy 
indeed beside knowing the rules which guide the ap 
pearances and resolving them into the real motions 
from which they arise we can refea these motions to 
the forces which produce them in optics we have 
become acquainted with a vast number of laws by 
which varied and beautiful phenomena are governed 
and perhaps we may assume since the evidence of the 
undulatory theory has been so fully developed that 
we know also the causes of the phenomena but in 
a large class of sciences while we have learnt many 
laws of phenomena the causes by which these arc 
produced are still unknown or disputed are we to 
ascribe to the operation of a fluid or fluids and if so 
in what manner the facts of heat magnetism elec 
tricity galvanism what are the forces by which the 
elements of chemical compounds are held together 
what are the forces of a higher order as we cannot 
help believing by which the course of vital action in 
organized bodies is kept up in these and other cases 
we have extensive departments of science but we are 
as yet unable to trace the effects to their causes and 
our science so far as it is positive and certain consists 
entirely of the laws of phenomena 

 in those cases in which we have a division of 
the science which teaches us the doctrine of the causes 
as well as one which states the rules which the effects 
follow i have in the history distinguished the two 
portions of the science by certain terjns i have hus 
spoken oiformal a stronomy and physical astronomy 
the latter phrase has long been commonly employed to 
describe that department of astronomy which deals with 



 


construction of science 


those forces by which the heavenly bodies are guided in 
their motions the former adjective appears well suited 
to describe a collection of rules depending on those ideas 
of space time position number which are as we have 
already said the forms of our apprehension of pheno 
mena f the laws of phenomena may be considered as 
formulas expressing results in terms of those ideas 
in like manner i have spoken of formal optics and 
physical optics the latter division including all 
speculations concerning the machinery by which the 
effects are produced formal acoustics and physical 
acoustics may be distinguished in like manner al 
though these two portions of science have been a good 
deal mixed together by most of those who have treated 
of them formal thermotics the knowledge of the 
laws of the phenomena of heat ought in like manner 
to lead to physical thermotics or the theory of heat 
with reference to the cause by which its effects are 
produced — a branch of science which as yet can hardly 
be said to exist 

 what kinds of muse are we to admit in science 
this is an important and by no means an easy ques 
tion in order to answer it we must consider in fahat 
manner our progress in the knowledge of causes has 
hitherto been made by far the most conspicuous in 
stance of success in such researches is the discovery 
of the causes of the motions of the heavenly bodies 
in this case after the formal laws of the motions — 
their conditions as to space and time — had become 
known men were dnabled to go a step further to re 
duce them to the familiar and general cause of motion 
— mechanical force and to determine the laws which 
this force follows that this was a step in addition to 
the knowledge previously possessed and that it was a 
real and peculiar truth will not be contested and a 
step in any other subject which should be analogous to 
this in astronomy — a discovery of causes and forces 
as certain and clear as the discovery of universal gravi 
tation — would undoubtedly be a vast advance upon 
a body of science consisting only of the laws of phe 
nomena 



of laws of phenomena and of causes 


 but though physical astronomy may well be 
taken as a standard in estimating the value and mag 
nitude of the advance from the knowledge of pheno 
mena to the knowledge of causes the peculiar features 
of the transition from formal to physical science in 
that subject must not be allowed to limit too narrowly 
our views of the nature of this transition in other 
cases we are not for example to consider that the 
step which leads us to the knowledge of causes in any 
province of nature must necessarily consist in the dis 
cover of centers of forces and collections of such cen 
ters by which the effects are produced the discovery 
of the causes of phenomena may ynply the detection 
of a fluid by whose undulations or oilier operations 
the results are occasioned the phenomena of acoustics 
are we know produced in this manner by the air 
and in the cases of light heat magnetism and others 
even if we reject all the theories of such fluids which 
have hitherto been proposed we still cannot deny that 
such theories are intelligible and possible as the dis 
cussions concerning them have shown nor can it be 
doubted that if the assumption of such a fluid in any 
case were as well evidenced as the doctrine of univer 
sal gravitation is it must be considered as a highly 
valuable theory 

 but again not only must we in aiming at the 
formation of a causal section in each science of phe 
nomena consider fluids and their various modes of 
operation admissible as well as centers of mechanical 
force but we must be prepared it be necessary to 
consider the forces or powers to which we refer the 
phenomena under still more general aspects and in 
vested with characters different from mere mechanical 
force for example the forces by which the chemical 
elements of bodies are bound together and from which 
arise both their sensible texture their crystalline form 
and their chemical composition are certainly forces of 
a very different nature from the mere attraction of 
matter according to its mass thepowers of assimila 
tion and reproduction in plants and animals are obvi 
ouslr still more removed from mere mechanism yet 



 


construction of science 


these powers are not on that account les§ real nor a 
less fit and worthy subject of scientific inquiry 

 in f fact these forces — mechanical chemical and 
vital — as we advance from one to the other each bring 
into our consideration new characters and what these 
characters are has appeared in the historical survey 
which we made of the fundamental ideas of the various 
sciences it was then shown that the forces by which 
chemical effects are produced necessarily involve the 
idea of polarity — they are polar forces the particles 
tend together in virtue of opposite properties which in 
the combination neutralize each other hence in at 
tempting to advance to a theory of causes in chemistry 
our task is by no means to invent laws of mechanical 
force and collections of forces by which the effects 
may be produced we know beforehand that no such 
attempt can succeed our aim must be to conceive 
such new kinds of force including polarity among 
their characters as may best render the results in 
telligible 

 thus in advancing to a science of cause in any 
subject the labour and the struggle is not to analyse 
the phenomena according to any preconceived and 
already familiar ideas but to form distinctly new con 
ceptions such as do really carry us to a more intimate 
view of the processes of nature thus in the case of 
astronomy the obstacle which deferred the discovery 
of the true causes from the time of kepler to that of 
newton was the difficulty of taking hold of mechanical 
conceptions and axioms with sufficient clearness and 
steadiness which during the whole of that interval 
mathematicians were learning to do in the question 
of causation which now lies most immediately in the 
path of science that of the causes of electrical and 
chemical phenomena the business of rightly fixing and 
limiting the conception of polarity is the proper object 
of the efforts of discoverers accordingly a large por 
tion of mr faradays recent labours is directed not to 


 eleventh twelfth and thirteenth series of researches phil trans 
 and 



of laws of phenomena and of causes 


the attempt at discovering new laws of phenomena but 
to the task of throwing light upon he conception of 
polarity and of showing how it must be understood so 
that it shall include electrical induction and other phe 
nomena whifii have commonly been ascribed to forces 
acting mechanically at a distance he is by no means 
content nor would it answer the ends of science that 
he should be with stating the results of his experi 
ments he is constantly in every page pointing out 
the interpretation of his experiments and showing how 
the conception of polar forces enters into this inter 
pretation ‘ shall he says® ‘ use every opportunity 
which presents itself of returning to that strong test of 
truth experiment but he adds ‘ i sjiall necessarily 
have occasion to speak theoretically and even hypo 
thetically’ his hypothesis that electrical inductive 
action always takes place by means of a continuous line 
of polarized particles and not by attraction and repul 
sion at a distance if established cannot fail to be a 
great step on our way towards a knowledge of causes 
as well as phenomena in the subjects under his con 
sideration 

i the process of obtaining new conceptions is to 
most minds far more unwelcome than any labour in 
employing old ideas the effort is indeed painful and 
oppressive it is feeling in the dark for an object which 
we cannot find hence it is not surprising that we 
should far more willingly proceed to seek for new causes 
by applying conceptions borrowed from old ones men 
were familiar with solid frames and with whirlpools of 
fluid when they had not learnt to form any clear con 
ception of attraction at a distance hence they at 
first imagined the heavenly motions to be caused by 
crystalline spheres and by vortices at length they 
were taught to conceive central forces and then they 
reduced the solar system to these but having done 
this they fancied that all the rest of the jnachinery of 
nature must be central forces we find htwton 


 art x 



 construction of science 

expressing this conviction and the mathematicians of 
the last century ted upon it very extensively we 
may especially remark laplace’s labours in this field 
having explained by such forces the phenomena of 
capillary attraction he attempted to apply the same 
kind of explanation to the reflection refraction and 
double refraction of light — to the constitution of 
gases — to the operation of heat it was soon seen that 
the explanation of refraction was arbitrary and that 
of double refraction illusory while polarization entirely 
eluded the grasp of this machinery centers of force 
would no longer represent the modes of causation 
which belonged to the phenomena polarization re 
quired some other contrivance such as the undulatory 
theory supplied nto theory of light can be of any 
avail in which the fundamental idea of polarity is not 
clearly exhibited 

 the sciences of magnetism and electricity have 
given rise to theories in which this relation of polarity 
is exhibited by means of two opposite fluids — a 
positive and a negative fluid or a vitreous and a resin 
ous for electricity and a boreal and an austral fluid 
for magnetism the hypothesis of such fluids gives 
results agreeing in a remarkable manner with the 
facts and their measures as coulomb and others have 
shown it may be asked how far we may in such a 
case suppose that we have discovered the true cause of 
the phenomena and whether it is sufficiently proved 
that these fluids really exist the right answer seems 
to be that the hypothesis certainly represents the 
truth so far as regards the polar relation” of the two 
energies and the laws of the attractive and repulsive 
forces of the particles in which these energies reside 
but that we are not entitled to assume that the vehi 
cles of these energies possess other attributes of mate 
rial fluids or that the forces thus ascribed to the 
particles are the primary elementary forces from which 


 multa me movent pret to the principia already quoted in the 
history

the action originates we are the more bound to 
place this cautious limit to our acceptance of the cou 
lombian theory since in electricity faraday has in 
vain endeavoured to bring into view one of the polar 
fluids without the other whereas such a result ought 
to be possible if there were two separable fluids the 
impossibility of this separate exhibition of one fluid 
appears to show that the fluids are real only so far as 
they are polar and faraday’s view above mentioned 
according to which the attractions at a distance are 
resolved into the action of lines of polarized particles 
of air appears still further to show that the concep 
tions hitherto entertained of electrical forces according 
to the coulombian theory do not penetrate to the real 
and intimate nature of the causation belonging to this 
case 

 since it is thus difficult to know when we have 
seized the true cause of the phenomena in any depart 
ment of science it may appear to some persons that 
physical inquirers are imprudent and unphilosophical 
in undertaking this research of causes and that it 
would be safer and wiser to confine ourselves to the 
investigation of the laws of phenomena in which field 
the knowledge which we obtain is definite and certain 
hence there have not been wanting those who have 
• laid it down as a maxim that ‘ science must study only 
the laws of phenomena and never the mode of produc 
tion ’ but it is easy to see that such a maxim would 
confine the breadth and depth of scientific inquiries to 
a most sciyity and miserable lirflit indeed such a 
rule would defeat its own object for the laws of phe 
nomena in many cases cannot be even expressed or 
understood without some hypothesis respecting their 
mode of production how could the phenomena of 
polarization have been conceived or reasoned upon 
except by imagining a polar arrangement of particles 
or transverse vibrations or some equivalent hypothe 
sis the doctrines of fits of easy transmission the doc 
trine of jnoveable polarization and the like even when 


 comte philosophic positive

erroneous as representing the whole of the phenomena 
were still useful ill combining some of them into laws 
and without some such hypotheses the facts could not 
have been followed out the doctrine of a fluid caloric 
may be false but without imagining sucsi a fluid how 
could the movement of heat from one part of a body to 
anotherbe conceived it may be replied that fourier 
laplace poisson who have principally cultivated the 
theory of heat have not conceived it as a fluid but 
have referred conduction to the radiation of the mole 
cules of bodies which they suppose to be separate points 
but this molecular constitution of bodies is itself an 
assumption of the node in which the phenomena are 
produced and the radiation of heat suggests inquiries 
concerning a fluid emanation no less than its conduc 
tion does in like manner the attempts to connect 
the laws of phenomena of heat and of gases have led 
to hypotheses respecting the constitution of gases and 
the combination of their particles with those of caloric 
which hypotheses may be false but are probably the 
best means of discovering the truth 

to debar science from inquiries like these on the 
ground that it is her business to inquire into facts 
and not to speculate about causes is a curious example 
of that barren caution which hopes for truth without 
daring to venture upon the quest of it this temper 
would have stopped with kepler’s discoveries and 
would have refused to go on with newton to inquire 
into the mode in which the phenomena are produced 
it would have stopped with newton’s optical facts 
and would have refused to go on with him and his 
successors to inquire into the mode in which these 
phenomena are produced and as we have abundantly 
shown it would on that very account have failed in 
seeing what the phenomena really are 

in many subjects the attempt to study the laws of 
phenomena independently of any speculations respect 
ing the causes which have produced them is neither 
possible for human intelligence nor for human temper 
men cannot contemplate the phenomena without 
clothing them in terms of some hypothesis and will 



of laws qf phenomena and of causes j j 


not be schooled to suppress the questionings which at 
every moment rise up within them concerning the 
causes of the phenomena who can attend to the 
appearances which come under the notice of the geolo 
gist — strata regularly bedded full of the remains of 
animals such as now live in the depths of the ocean 
raised to the tops of mountains broken contorted 
mixed with rocks such as still flow from the mouths of 
volcanos — who can see phenomena like thae and 
imagine that he best promotes the process of our 
knowledge of the earth’s history by noting down the 
facts and abstaining from all inquiry whether these 
are really proofs of past states of the earth and of sub 
terraneous forces or merely an accidental imitation of 
the effects of such causes in this and similar cases 
to proscribe the inquiry into causes would be to anni 
hilate the science 

finally this caution does not even gain its own 
single end the escape from hypotheses for as we 
have said those who will not seek for new and appro 
priate causes of newlystudied phenomena are almost 
inevitably led to ascribe the facts to modifications of 
causes already familiar they may declare that they 
will not hear of such causes as vital powers elective 
affinities electric or calorific or luminiferous ethers or 
jtiuids but they will not the less on that account 
assume hypotheses equally unauthorized — for instance 
— universal mechanical forces a molecular constitu 
tion of bodies solid hard inert matter — and will 
apply these hypotheses in a manner which is arbitrary 
in itself as well as quite insufficient for its purpose 

ii it appears then to be required both by the 
analogy of the most successful efforts of science in past 
times and by the irrepressible speculative powers of 
the human mind that we should attempt to discover 
both the laws of phenomena and their causes in every 
department of science when prosecuted far enough 
these two great steps of investigation must stxcceed 
each other the laws of phenomena must be known 
before we can speculate concerning causes the causes 
must be inquired into when the phenomena have been 



 


construction of science 


reduced to rule in both these speculations the sup 
positions and conceptions which occur must be con 
stantly tested by reference to observation and experi 
ment in both we must as far as possible devise 
hypotheses which when we thus test hhem display 
those characters of truth of which we have already 
spoken — an agreement with facts such as will stand 
the most patient and rigid inquiry a provision for 
predicting truly the results of untried cases a consi 
lience of inductions from various classes of facts and 
a progressive tendency of the scheme to simplicity and 
unity 

we shall attempt hereafter to give several rules of a 
more precise and detailed kind for the discovery of the 
causes and still more of the laws of phenomena but 
it will be useful in the first place to point out the 
classification of the sciences which results from the 
principles already established in this word and for 
this purpose we must previously decide the question 
whether the practical arts as medicine and engineer 
ing must be included in our list of sciences

aphorism xxv 

art and science differ the object of science is know 
ledge the objects of art are works in art truth is a 
means to an end in science it is the only end hence the 
practical arts are not to be classed among the sciences 

aphorism xxvi 

practical knowledge such as art implies is not know 
ledge such as science includes brute animals have a prac 
tical knowledge of relations of space and force but they have 
no knowledge of geometry or mechanics 

i rtlhe distinction of arts and sciences very mate 
 jl rially affects all classifications of the departments 
of human knowledge it is often maintained ex 
pressly or tacitly that the arts are a part of our 
knowledge in the same sense in which the sciences 
are so and tjiat art is the application of science to the 
purposes of practical life it will be found that these 
views require some correction when we understand 
silence in the exact sense in which we have through ‘ 
out endeavoured to contemplate it and in which alone 
our examination of its nature can instruct us in the 
true foundations of our knowledge 

when we cast our eyes upon the early stages of 
the histories of nations we cannot ail to be struck 
with the consideration that in many countries the 
arts of life already appear at least in some rude form 
or othfer when as yet nothing of science exists a

constriction of science 


practical knowledge of astronomy such as enables them 
to reckon months and years is found among all nations 
except the mere savages a practical knowledge of 
mechanics must have existed in those nations which 
have left us the gigantic monuments of early architec 
ture the pyramids and temples of egypt and nubia 
the cyclopean walls of italy and greece the temples 
of magna graecia and sicily the obelisks and edifices 
of indii the cromlechs and druidical circles of coun 
tries formerly celtic — must have demanded no small 
practical mechanical skill and power yett those 
 modes of reckoning time must have preceded the rise 
of speculative astronomy these structures must have 
been erected jbefore the theory of mechanics was 
known to suppose as some have done a great body 
of science now lost to have existed in the remote 
ages to which these remains belong is not only quite 
gratuitous and contrary to all analogy but is a suppo 
sition which cannot be extended so far as to explain 
all such cases for it is impossible to imagine that 
every art has been preceded by the science which ren 
ders a reason for its processes certainly men formed 
wine from the grape before they possessed a science of 
fermentation the first instructor of every artificer in 
brass and iron can hardly be supposed to have taught 
the chemistry of metals as a science the inventor 
of the square and the compasses had probably no more 
knowledge of demonstrated geometry than have the 
artisans who now use those implements and finally 
the use of speech the employment of the inflections 
and combinations or words must needs be assumed as 
having been prior to any general view of the nature 
and analogy of language even at this moment tfie 
greater part of the arts which exist in the world are 
not accompanied by the sciences on which they theo 
retically depend who shall state to us the general 
chemical truths to which the manufactures of glass 
and porcelain and iron and brass owe their existence

artifices long before science explains the ground of the 
process do not arts at this day exist in a high state

of perfection in countries in which there is no science 
as china and india these countries and many others 
have no theories of mechanics of optics of clfemistry 
of physiology yet they construct and use mechanical 
and optical instruments make chemical combinations 
take advantage of physiological laws it is too evident 
to need further illustration that art may exist without 
science — that the former has usually been anterior to 
the latter and even now commonly advanfssnde 
pendently leaving science to follow as it can 

 we here mean by science that exact general 
speculative knowledge of which we have throughout 
this work been endeavouring to exhibit the nature 
and rules between such science and the practical 
arts of life the points of difference are sufficiently 
manifest the object of science is knowledge the 
object of art are works the latter is satisfied with 
producing its material results to the former the ope 
rations of matter whether natural or artificial are 
interesting only so far as they can be embraced by 
intelligible principles the end of art is the beginning 
of science for when it is seen what is done then 
comes the question why it is done art may have 
fixed general rules stated in w t ords but she has 
these merely as means to an end to science the pro 
positions which she obtains are each in itself a suffi 
cient end of the effort by which it is acquired when 
art has brought forth her product her task is finished 
science is constantly led by one step of her path to 
another eagh proposition which she obtains impels 
her to go onwards to other propositions more general 
more profound more simple art puts elements toge 
ther without caring to know what they are or why 
they coalesce science analyses the compound and at 
every such step strives not only to perform but to 
understand the analysis art advances in proportion 
as she becomes able to bring forth products more 
multiplied more complex more various but scidhce 
straining her eyes to penetrate more and more deeply 
into the nature of things reckons her success in pro 
portioi as she sees in all the phenomena however 



 


construction of science 


multiplied complex and varied the results of one or 
two simple and general laws 

 there are many acts which man as well as 
animals performs by the guidance of nature without 
seeing or seeking the reason why he des so as the 
acts •by which he balances himself in standing or 
moving and those by which he judges of the form and 
position of the objects around him these actions 
have tiwirreason in the principles of geometiy and 
mechanics but of such reasons he who thus acts is 
unaware he works blindly under the impulss of an 
unknown principle which we call instinct when 
man’s speculative nature seeks and finds the reasons 
why he should act thus or thus — why he should 
stretch out his arm to prevent liis falling or assign a 
certain position to an object in consequence of the 
angles under which it is seen — he may perform the 
same actions as before but they are then done by the 
aid of a different faculty which for the sake of dis 
tinction we may call insight instinct is a purely 
active principle it is seen in deeds alone it has no 
power of looking inwards it asks no questions it has 
no tendency to discover reasons or rules it is the 
opposite of insight 

 art ft not identical with instinct on the con 
trary there are broad differences instinct is station 
ary art is progressive instinct is mute it acts 
but gives no rules for acting art can speak she can 
lay down rules but though art is thus separate 
from instinct she is not essentially combined with 
insight she can see what to do but she needs not 
to see why it is done she may lay down buies but it 
is not her business to give beasons when man makes 
that his employment he enters upon the domain of 
science art takes the phenomena and laws of nature 
as she finds them that they are multiplied complex 
capricious incoherent disturbs her not she is con 
tent that the rides of nature’s operations should be 
perfectly arbitrary and unintelligible provided they 
are constant so that she can depend upon their effects 
but science is impatient of all appearance of caprice

inconsistency irregularity in nature she will not 
believe in the existence of such characters she re 
solves one apparent anomaly after another he task is 
not ended till every thing is so plain and simple that 
she is temptecf to believe that she sees that it could by 
no possibility have been otherwise than it is 

 it may be said thaf after all art does really 
involve the knowledge which science deli vers — that 
the artisan who raises large weights pract igfcnow 
the properties of the mechanical powers — that he 
who manufactures chemical compounds is virtually 
acquainted with tlie laws of chemical combination 
to this we reply that it might on the same grounds 
be asserted that he who acts upon the principle that 
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third is 
really acquainted with geometry and that he who 
balances himself on one foot knows the properties of 
the center of gravity but this is an acquaintance 
with geometiy and mechanics which even brute ani 
mals possess it is evident that it is not of such 
knowledge as this that we have here to treat it is 
plain that this mode of possessing principles is alto 
gether different from that contemplation of them on 
which science is founded we neglect the most essen 
tial and manifest differences if we confound our un 
oonscious assumptions with our demonstrative reason 
ings 

 the real state of the case is that the principles 
which art involves science alone evolves the truths 
on which the success of art defends lurk in the 
artist’s mind in an undeveloped state guiding his 
hand stimulating his invention balancing his judg 
ment but not appearing in the form of enunciated 
propositions principles are not to him direct objects 
of meditation they are secret powers of nature to 
which the forms which tenant the world owe their 
constancy their movements their changes their luxu 
riant and varied growth but whicl he can nowhere 
directly contemplate that the creative and directive 
principles which have their lodgment in the artist’s 
mind when unfolded by our speculative powers into

systematic shape become science is true but it is 
precisely this process of development which gives to 
them their character of science in practical art 
principles are unseen guides leading us by invisible 
strings through paths where the end alone is looked 
at it is for science to direct and purge our vision so 
that these airy ties these principles and laws generali 
zations and theories become distinct objects of vision 
many mfy eel the intellectual monitor but it is only 
to her favourite heroes that the goddess of wisdom 
visibly reveals herself 

 thus art in its earlier stages at least is widely 
different from science is independent of it and is ante 
rior to it at later period no doubt art may borrow 
aid from science and the discoveries of the philo 
sopher may be of great value to the manufacturer and 
the artist but even then this application forms no 
essential part of the science the interest which be 
longs to it is not an intellectual interest the aug 
mentation of human power and convenience may impel 
or reward the physical philosopher but the processes 
by which man’s repasts are rendered more delicious 
his journeys more rapid his weapons more terrible 
are not therefore science they may involve princi 
ples which are of the highest interest to science but 
as the advantage is not practically more precious be 
cause it results from a beautiful theory so the theore 
tical principle has no more conspicuous place in science 
because it leads to convenient practical consequences 
the nature of science is purely intellectual y knowledge 
alone — exact general truth — is her object and we 
cannot mix with such materials as matters of the same 
kind the merely empirical maxims of art without 
introducing endless confusion into the subject and 
making it impossible to attain any solid footing in our 
philosophy 

 t i shall therefore not place in our classification 
of the sciences the arts as has generally been done 
nor shall i notice the applications of sciences to art 
as forming any separate portion of each science the 
sciences considered as bodies of general speculative 



of art and science 


 


truths are what we are here concerned with and 
applications of such truths whether useful or useless 
are important to us only as illustrations and examples 
whatever place in human knowledge the practical 
arts may hold they are not sciences and it is only 
by this rigorous separation of the practical fiom the 
theoretical that we can arrive at any solid conclusions 
respecting the nature of truth and the mode of arriv 
ing at it such as it is our object to attain 



chapter ix 

of the classification of sciences 


i mhe classification of sciences has its chief use in 
 pointing out to us the extent of our powers of 
arriving at truth and the analogies which may obtain 
between those certain and lucid portions of knowledge 
with which we are here concerned and those other 
portions of a very different interest and evidence 
which we here purposely abstain to touch upon the 
classification of human knowledge will therefore have 
a more peculiar importance when we can include in it 
the moral political and metaphysical as well as the 
physical portions of our knowledge but such a sur 
vey does not belong to our present undertaking and 
a general view of the connexion and order of the 
branches of sciences which our review has hitherto ini 
eluded will even now possess some interest and may 
serve hereafter as an introduction to a more complete 
scheme of the general body of human knowledge 

 in this as in any other case a sound classifica 
tion must be the result not of any assumed principles 
imperatively applied to the subject but an exami 
nation of the objects to be classified — of an analysis of 
them into the principles in which they agree and differ 
the classification of sciences must result from the 
consideration of their nature and contents accord 
ingly that review of the sciences in which the history of 
the sciences engaged us led to a classification of which 
the main features are indicated in that work the 
classification thu obtained depends neither upon the 
faculties of the mind to which the separate parts of 
our knowledge owe their origin nor upon the objects 
which each science contemplates but upon a more 



classification of •sciences 


 


natural apd fundamental element — namely the ideas 
which each science involves the ideas regulate and 
connect the facts and ate the foundations ofthe rea 
soning in each science and having in another work 
more fully examined these ideas we are now prepared 
to state here the classification to which they lead if 
we have rightly traced each science to the conceptions 
which are really fundamental with regard to it and 
which give rise to the first principles cm it 

depends it is not necessaiy for our purpose that we 
should decide whether these conceptions are absolutely 
ultimate principles of thought or whether on the con 
trary they can be further resolvec into other fundar 
mental ideas we need not now suppose it deter 
mined whether or not number is a mere modification 
of the idea of time and force a mere modification of 
the idea of cause for however this may be our con 
ception of number is the foundation of arithmetic 
and our conception of force is the foundation of me 
chanics it is to be observed also that in our classifi 
cation each science may involve not only the ideas 
or conceptions which are placed opposite to it in the 
list but also all which precede it thus formal astro 
nomy involves not only the conception of motion but 
also those which are the foundation of arithmetic and 
geometry in like manner physical astronomy em 
ploys the sciences of statics and dynamics and thus 
rests on their foundations and they in turn depend 
upon the ideas of space and of time as well as of 
cause 

 we may further observe that this arrangement 
of sciences according to the fundamental ideas which 
they involve points out the transition from those parts 
of human knowledge which have been included in our 
history and philosophy to other regions of speculation 
into which we have not entered we have repeatedly 
found ourselves upon the borders of inquiries of a 
psychological or moral or theological nature thus 
the hjgtpry of physiology led us to the consideration 


 hist ind sc b xvii c v sect 


 construction of science 

of life sensation and volition and at these ideas we 
stopped that we might not transgress the boundaries of 
our subject as then predetermined it is plain that 
the pursuit of such conceptions and their consequences 
would lead us to the sciences if we are allowed to call 
them sciences which contemplate not only animal but 
human principles of action to anthropology and psy 
chology in other ways too the ideas which we have 
exafirfraialthough manifestly the foundations of sci 
ences such as we have here treated of also plainly 
pointed to speculations of a different order thus the 
idea of a final cause is an indispensable guide in 
biology as we haveseen but the conception of design 
as directing thq order of nature once admitted soon 
carries us to higher contemplations again the class 
of pal etiological sciences which we were in the his 
tory led to construct although we there admitted only 
one example of the class namely geology does in 
reality include many vast lines of research as the 
history and causes of the diffusion of plants and ani 
mals the history of languages arts and consequently 
of civilization along with these researches comes 
the question how far these histories point backwards to 
a natural or a supernatural origin and the idea of a 
first cause is thus brought under our donsideration 
finally it is not difficult to see that as the physical • 
sciences have their peculiar governing ideas which 
support and shape them so the moral and political 
sciences also must similarly have their fundamental 
and formative ideas” the source of universal and cer 
tain truths each of their proper kind but to follow 
out the traces of this analogy and to verify the ex 
istence of those fundamental ideas in morals and 
politics is a task quite out of the sphere of the work 
in which we are here engaged 

 we may now place before the reader our classi 
fication of the sciences i have added to the list of 
sciences a few not belonging to our present subject 
that the nature of the transition by which wp are to 
extend our philosophy into a wider and higher region 
may be in some measure perceived 



classification of sciences 

the classification of the sciences is given over leaf 

a few remarks upon it offer themselves 

the pure mathematical sciences can hardly e called 
inductive sciences their principles are not obtained 
by induction from facts but are necessarily assumed 
in reasoning upon the subject matter vrhih those 
sciences involve 

the astronomy of the ancients aimed only at ex 
plaining the motions of the heavenly bodies mmhctr 
nism modern astronomy explains these motions on 
the principles of mechanics 

the term physics when confined to a peculiar 
class of sciences is usually understood to exclude the 
mechanical sciences on the one side and chemistry 
on the other and thus embraces the secondary mecha 
nical and analyticomechanical sciences but the ad 
jective physical applied to any science and opposed 
to formal as in astronomy and optics implies those 
speculations in which we consider not only the laws 
of phenomena but their causes and generally as 
in those cases their mechanical causes 

the term metaphysics is applied to subjects in which 
the facts examined are emotions thoughts and mental 
conditions subjects not included in our present survey

of methods employed in the formation 
of science 


chapter i 
introductiqn 


aphorism xxvii 

the methods hy which the construction of science is pro 
moted are methods of observation methods of obtaining 
clear ideas and methods of induction 

i n the preceding book we pointed out certain 
general characters of scientific knowledge which 
may often serve to distinguish it from ©pinions of a 
looser or vaguer kind in the course of thje progress 
of knowledge from the earliest to tl present time men 
have been led to a perception more or less clear of 
these characteristics various philosophers from plate 
and aristotle in the ancient world to richard de saint 
victor and roger bacon in the middle ages galileo 
and gilbert francis bacon and isaac newton in modem 
times were led to offer precepts and maxims as fitted 
to guide us to a real and fundamental knowledge of 
nature it may on another occasion be dur business 
to estimate the value of these precepts and maxims 
and other contributions of the same kind to the phi 
losophy of science might be noticed and some which 



i 


formation of science 


contain still more valuable suggestions and indicate a 
more practical acquaintance with the subject among 
these i must especially distinguish sir john herschel’s 
discourse on the study of natural philosophy but my 
object at present is not to relate the history but to pre 
sent the really valuable results of preceding labours and 
i shall endeavour to collect both from them and from 
my own researches and reflections such views and 
such rules as seem best adapted to assist us in the 
discovery and recognition of scientific truth or at 
least such as may enable us to understand the pro 
cess by which this truth is obtained i would present 
to the reader the philosophy and if possible the art 
of discovery 

 but in truth we must acknowledge before we 
proceed with this subject that speaking with strict 
ness an art of discovery is not possible— that we can 
give no buies for the pursuit of truth which shall be 
universally and peremptorily applicable — and that the 
helps which we can offer to the inquirer in such cases 
are limited and precarious still we trust it will be 
found that aids may be pointed out which are neither 
worthless nor uninsfcructive the mere classification 
of examples of successful inquiry to which our rules 
give occasion is full of interest for the philosophical 
speculator and if our maxims direct the discoyerej’ 
to no operations which might not have occurred to 
his mind of themselves they may still concentrate our 
attention on that which is most important and cha 
racteristic in these operations and may direct us to 
the best mode of insimng their success i shall 
therefore attempt to resolve the process of discovery 
into its parts and to give an account as distinct as 
may be of buies and methods which belong to each 
portion of the process 

 in book ii we considered the three main 
parts of the process by which science is constructed 
namely the decomposition and observation of com 
plex facts the explication of our ideal concep 
tions and the colligation of elementary f acts by 
means of those conceptions the first and last of 



introduction 


 


these three steps are capable of receiving additional 
accuracy by peculiar processes they may further the 
advance of science in a more effectual manner when 
directed by special technical methods of which in the 
present book e must give a brief view in this more 
technical form the observation of facts involves the 
measurement of phenomena and the colligation of 
facts includes all arts and rules by which the process 
of induction can be assisted hence we shall have 
here to consider methods of observation and methods 
of induction t using these phrases in the widest sense 
the second of the three steps above mentioned the 
explication of our conceptions does not admit of be 
ing much assisted by methods although something may 
be done by education and discussion 

 the methods of induction of which tve have to 
speak apply only to the first step in our ascent from 
phenomena to laws of nature — the discovery of laws 
of phenomena a higher and ulterior step remains 
behind and follows in natural order the discovery of 
laws of phenomena namely the discovery of causes 
and this must be stated as a distinct and essential pro 
cess in a complete view of the course of science again 
when we have thus ascended to the causes of pheno 
mena and of their laws we can often reason down 
wards from the cause so discovered and we are thus 
led to suggestions of new phenomena or to new expla 
nations of phenomena already known such proceed 
ings may be termed applications of our discoveries 
including in the phrase verifications of our doctrines 
by such an application of them to observed facts 
hence we have the following series of processes con 
cerned in the formation of science 

s i decomposition of facts 

 measurement of phenomena 

f explication of conceptions 

 induction of laws of phenomena 

 induction of causes 

 application of inductivh discoveries 

 of these six processes the methods by which 
the sdcond and fourth may be assisted are here our 



 formation of science 

peculiar object of attention the treatment of these 
subjects in the present work must necessarily be scanty 
and imperfect although we may perhaps be able to add 
something to what has hitherto been systematically 
taught on these heads methods of observation and 
of induction might of themselves form an abundant 
subject for a treatise and hereafter probably will do 
so in the hands of future writers a few remarks 
offered as contributions to this subject may serve to 
show how extensive it is and how much more ready 
it now is than it ever before was for a systematic dis 
cussion 

of the above steps of the formation of science the 
first the decomposition of facts has already been 
sufficiently explained in the hist book for if we 
pursue it into further detail and exactitude we find 
that we gradually trench upon some of the succeed 
ing parts i therefore proceed to treat of the second 
•step the measurement of phenomena — of methods 
by which this work in its widest sense is executed 
and these i shall term methods of observation 



chapter ii 


of methods of observation 


aphorism xxviii 

the methods of observation of quantity in general are 
numeration which is precise by the naiure of number the 
measurement of space and of time whicit are easily made 
precise the conversion cf space and time by which each 
aids the measurement of the other the method of repe 
tition the method of coincidences or interferences the 
measurement of weight is made precise by the method of 
doubleweighing secondary qualities are measured by 
means of scaleb of degrees but in order to apply these 
scales the student requires the education of the senses 
the education of the senses is forwarded by the practical 
study of descriptive natural history chemical manipu 
lation and astronomical observation 

i i shall speak in this chapter of methods 
x of exact and systematic observation by which 
such facts are collected as form the materials of precise 
scientific propositions these methods are very vari 
ous according to the nature of the subject inquired 
into and other circumstances but a great portion of 
them agree in being processes of measurement these 
i shall peculiarly consider and in the first place those 
referring to number space and time which are at 
the same time objects and instrument of measure 
ment 

 but though we have to explain how observa 
tions gnav be made as perfect as possible we must not 
forget that in most cases complete perfection is unat 
tainable observations are never perfect for we 

nov ora 



 formation of science 

observe phenomena by our senses and measure their 
relations in time and space but our senses and our 
measures are all from various causes inaccurate if 
we have to observe the exact place of the moon among 
the stars how much of instrumental apparatus is 
necessary this apparatus has been improved by 
many successive generations of astronomers yet it is 
still far from being perfect and the senses of man 
as well as his implements are limited in their exact 
ness two different observers do not obtain precisely 
the same measures of the time and place of a pheno 
menon as for instance of the moment at which the 
moon occults a stqr and the point of her limb at which 
the occultatioi takes place here then is a source of 
inaccuracy and errour even in astronomy where the 
means of exact observation are incomparably more 
complete than they are in any other department of 
human research in other cases the task of obtaining 
accurate measures is far more difficult if we have 
to observe the tides of the ocean when rippled with 
waves we can see the average level of the water first 
rise and then fall but how hard is it to select the exact 
moment when it is at its greatest h eight or the exact 
highest point which it reaches it is very easy in such 
a case to err by many minutes in time and by several 
inches in space 

still in many cases good methods can remove very 
much of this inaccuracy and to these we now proceed 

 i number — number is the first step of mea 
surement since it measures itself and does not like 
space and time require an arbitrary standard hence 
the first exact observations and the first advances of 
rigorous knowledge appear to have been made by means 
of number as for example — the number of days in a 
month and in a year — the cycles according to which 
eclipses occur — the number of days in the revolutions 
of the planets and the like all these discoveries as 
we have seen in the history of astronomy go back to 
the earliest perios of the science anterior to arr dis 
tinct tradition and these discoveries presuppose a series 
probably a very long series of observations made prin 



methods of observation 


 


cipally by means of number nations so yude as to 
have no other means of exact measurement have still 
systems of numeration by which they can reckon to a 
considerable extent y ery often such nations have very 
complex systems which are capable of expressing num 
bers of great magnitude number supplies the means 
of measuring other quantities by the assumption of a 
unit of measure of the appropriate kind but where 
nature supplies the unit number is applicable directly 
and immediately number is an important element in 
the classificatory as well as in the mathematical sci 
ences the history of those sciences shows how the 
formation of botanical systems was elfcted by the adop 
tion of number as a leading element by csesalpinus 
and how afterwards the reform of linnaeus in classifi 
cation depended in a great degree on his finding in the 
pistils and stamens a better numerical basis than those 
before employed in like manner the number of rays 
in the membrane of the gills and the number of rays 
in the fins of fisli were found to be important elements 
in ichthyological classification by artedi and linnaeus 
there are innumerable instances in all parts of natural 
history of the importance of the observation of num 
ber and in this observation no instrument scale or 
standard is needed or can be applied except the 
scsle f natural numbers expressed either in words or 
in figures can be considered as an instrument 

 il measurement of space — of quantities ad 
mitting of continuous increase and decrease for num 
ber is discontinuous space is the most simple in its 
mode of measurement and requires most frequently to 
be measured the obvious mode of measuring space is 
by the repeated application of a material measure as 
when we take a footrule and measure the length of a 
room and in this case the footrule is the unit of 
space and the length of the room is expressed by the 
number of such units which it contains or as it hmy 
not contain an exact number by avnumber with a 
fraction but besides this measurement of linear space 


 hist hid sc b xvi c vii

i formation of science 

there is another kind of space which for purposes of 
science it is still more important to measure namely 
angular space the visible heavens being considered 
as a sphere the portions and paths of the heavenly 
bodies are determined by drawing circles on the surface 
of this sphere and are expressed by means of the parts 
of these circles thus intercepted by such measures the 
doctrines of astronomy were obtained in the very begin 
ning of the science the arcs of circles thus measured 
are not like linear spaces reckoned by means of an 
arbitrary unit for there is a natural unit the total 
circumference to which all arcs may be referred for 
the sake of convenience the whole circumference is 
divided into parts or degrees and by means of 
these degrees and their parts all arcs are expressed 
the arcs are the measures of the angles at the center 
and the degrees may be considered indifferently as 
measuring the one or the other of these quantities 

 in the history of astronomy i have described 
the method of observation of celestial angles employed 
by the greeks they determined the lines in which 
the heavenly bodies were seen by means either of 
shadows or of sights and measured the angles be 
tween such lines by arcs or rules properly applied to 
them the armill astrolabe dioptra and paral 
lactic instrument of the ancients were some of the 
instruments thus constructed tycho brahe greatly 
improved the methods of astronomical observation by 
giving steadiness to the frame of his instruments 
which were large quadrants and accuracy to the 
divisions of the limb but the application of the tele 
scope to the astronomical quadrant and the fixation of 
the center of the field by a cross of fine wires placed in 
the focus was an immense improvement of the instru 
ment since it substituted a precise visual ray pointing 
to the star instead of the coarse coincidence of sights 
the accuracy of observation was still further increased

methods of observation 

by applying to the telescope a micrometer which might 
subdivide the smaller divisions of the arc 

 by this means the precision of astronomical ob 
servation was made so great that very minute angular 
spaces could be measured and it then became a ques 
tion whether discrepancies which appeared at first as 
defects in the theory might not arise sometimes from 
a bending or shaking of the instrument and from the 
degrees marked on the limb being really somewhat 
unequal instead of being rigorously equal accord 
ingly the framing and balancing of the instrument so 
as to avoid all possible tremor or flexure and the exact 
division of an arc into equal parts became great objects 
of those who wished to improve astumomical observa 
tions the observer no longer gazed at the stars from 
a lofty tower but placed his telescope on the solid 
ground and braced and balanced it with various con 
trivances instead of a quadrant an entire circle was 
introduced by ramsden and various processes were 
invented for the dividing of instruments among 
these we may notice tr ought oils method of dividing 
in which the visual ray of a microscope was substituted 
for the points of a pair of compasses and by stepping 
round the circle the partial arcs were made to bear 
their exact relation to the whole circumference 

 astronomy is not the only science which de 
fends on the measurement of angles crystallography 
also requires exact measures of this kind and the 
goniometer especially that devised by wollaston sup 
plies the means of obtaining suqji measures the 
science of optics also in many cases requires the mea 
surement of angles 

 in the measurement of linear space there is no 
natural standard which offers itself most of the com 
mon measures appear to be taken from some part of 
the human body as a foot a cubit a fathom but such 
measures cannot possess any precision and are altered 
by convention thus there were in ancient times many 
kinds of cubits and in modern europe there are a 
great niimber of different standards of the foot as the 
rhenish foot the paris foot the english foot it is

very desirable that if possible some permanent stand 
ard founded in nature should be adopted for the con 
ventional measures are lost in the course of ages and 
thus dimensions expressed by means of them become 
unintelligible two different natural standards have 
been employed in modern times the french have 
referred their measures of length to the total circum 
ference of a meridian of the earth a quadrant of this 
meridian consists of ten million units or metres the 
english have fixed their linear measure by reference to 
the length of a pendulum which employs an exact 
second of time in its small oscillation both these 
methods occasion considerable difficulties in carrying 
them into effect and are to be considered mainly as 
means of recovering the standard if it should ever be 
lost for common purposes some material standard is 
adopted as authority for the time for example the 
standard which in england possessed legal authority 
up to the year was preserved in the house of 
parliament and was lost in the conflagration which 
destroyed that edifice the standard of length now 
generally referred to by men of science in england is 
that which is in the possession of the astronomical 
society of london 

 a standard of length being established the 
artifices for applying it and for subdividing it in the 
most accurate manner are nearly the same as in tlie 
case of measures of arcs as for instance the employ 
ment of the visual rays of microscopes instead of the 
legs of compasses and the edges of rules the use of 
micrometers for minute measurements and the like 
many different modes of avoiding errour in such mea 
surements have been devised by various observers 
according to the nature of the cases with which they 
had to deal 

 iii measurement of time — the methods of 
measuring time are not so obvious as the methods of 


 on the precautions employed in astronomy in the cabinet cyclopee 
astronomical instruments for the dia arts — no 
measure of space see sir j herschel’s 



methods of observation 

measuring space for we cannot apply one portion of 
time to another so as to test their equality we are 
obliged to begin by assuming some change as the mea 
sure of time thus the motion of the sun in the sky 
or the length and position of the shadows of objects 
were the first modes of measuring the parts of the day 
but what assurance had men or what assurance could 
they have that the motion of the sun or of the shadow 
was uniform they could have no such assurance 
till they had adopted some measure of smaller times 
which smaller times making up larger times by repe 
tition they took as the standard of uniformity — for 
example an liourglass or a clepsydra which answered 
the same purpose among the ancients there is no 
apparent reason why the successive periods measured 
by the emptying of the hourglass should be unequal 
they are implicitly accepted as equal and by reference 
to these the uniformity of the sun’s motion may be 
verified but the great improvement in the measure 
ment of time was the use of a pendulum for the pur 
pose by galileo and the application of this device to 
clocks by huyghens in for the successive oscil 
lations of a pendulum are rigorously equal and a clock 
is only a train of machinery employed for the purpose 
of counting these oscillations by means of this inven 
tion the measure of time in astronomical observations 
became as accurate as the measure of space 

 what is the natural unit of time it was as 
sumed from the first by the greek astronomers that 
the sidereal days measured by thi revolution of a star 
from any meridian to the same meridian again are 
exactly equal and all improvements in the measure of 
time tended to confirm this assumption the sidereal 
day is therefore the natural standard of time but the 
solar day determined by the diurnal revolution of the 
sun although not rigorously invariable as the sidereal 
day is undergoes scarcely any perceptible variation 
and since the course of daily occurrences is regulated 
by the sun it is far more convenient to seek the basis 
of our unit of time in his motions accordingly the 
solar day the mean solar day is divided into hours 



 formation of science 

and these into minutes and seconds and this is our 
scale of time of such time the sidereal day has 
hours minutes seconds and it is plain that 
by such a statement the length of the hour is fixed 
with reference to a sidereal day the standard of 
time and the standard of space in like manner equally 
answers its purpose whether or not it coincides with 
any whole number of units 

 since the sidereal day is thus the standard of 
our measures of time it becomes desirable to refer to 
it constantly and exactly the instruments by which 
time is measured in order that we may secure our 
selves against errour for this purpose in astronomical 
observatories observations are constantly made of the 
transit of stars across the meridian the transit in 
strument with which this is done being adjusted with 
all imaginable regard to accuracy 

 when exact measures of time are required in 
other than astronomical observations the same instru 
ments are still used namely clocks and chronometers 
in chronometers the regulating part is an oscillating 
body not as in clocks a pendulum oscillating by the 
force of gravity but a wheel swinging to and fro on 
its center in consequence of the vibrations of a slen 
der coil of elastic wire to divide time into still 
smaller portions than these vibrations other artificer 
are used some of which will be mentioned under the 
next head 

 iv conversion of space and time — space 
and time agree in being extended quantities which are 
made up and measured by the repetition of homoge 
neous parts if a body move uniformly whether in 
the way of revolving or otherwise the space which any 
point describes is proportional to the time of its 
motion and the space and the time may each be 
taken as a measure of the other hence in such cases 
by taking space instead of time or time instead of 


 on the precautions employed in see herschel’s astronomy 
the measure of time by astronomers — 



methods of observation 


 


space we may often obtain more convenient and pre 
cise measures than we can by measuring directly the 
element with which we are concerned 

the most prominent example of such a conversion 
is the measurement of the right ascension of stars 
that is their angular distance from a standard meri 
dian on the celestial sphere by means of the time 
employed in their coming to the meridian of the place 
of observation since as we have already stated the 
visible celestial sphere carrying the fixed stars re 
volves with perfect uniformity about the pole if we 
observe the stars as they come in succession to a fixed 
circle passing through the poles th intervals of time 
between these observations will be proportional to the 
angles which the meridian circles passing through these 
stars make at the poles where they meet and hence 
if we have the means of measuring time with great 
accuracy we can by watching the times of the transits 
of successive stars across some visible mark in our own 
meridian determine the angular distances of the meri 
dian circles of all the stars from one another 

accordingly now that the pendulum clock affords 
astronomers the means of determining time exactly a 
measurement of the right ascensions of heavenly 
bodies by means of a clock and a transit instrument 
in a part of the regular business of an observatory if 
the sidereal clock be so adjusted that it marks the 
beginning of its scale of time when the first point of 
right ascension is upon the visible meridian of our 
observatory the point of the scale at which the clock 
points when any other star is in our meridian will 
truly represent the right ascension of the star 

thus as the motion of the stars is our measure of 
time we employ time conversely as our measure of 
the places of the stars the celestial machine and our 
terrestrial machines correspond to each other in their 
movements and the star steals silently and steadily 


• a meridian is a circle passing dian of anyplace on tlic earth is that 
through he poles about which the meridian which is exactly over the 
celestial sphere revolves the meri place 



 


formation of science 


across our meridian line just as the pointer of the 
clock steals past the mark of the hour w e may judge 
of the scale of this motion by considering that the full 
moon employs about two minutes of time in sailing 
across any fixed line seen against the sky transverse 
to her path and all the celestial bodies carried along 
by the revolving sphere travel at the same rate 

 in this case up to a certain degree we render 
our measures of astronomical angles more exact and 
convenient by substituting time for space but when 
in the very same kind of observation we wish to pro 
ceed to a greater degree of accuracy we find that it 
is best done by substituting sjmce for time in observ 
ing the transit of a star across the meridian if we 
have the clock within hearing we can count the beats 
of the pendulum by the noise which they make and 
tell exactly at which second of time the passage of the 
star across the visible thread takes place and thus we 
measure bight ascension by means of time but our 
perception of time does not allow us to divide a second 
into ten parts and to pronounce whether the transit 
takes place threetenths sixtenths or seventenths of 
a second after the preceding beat of the clock this 
however can be done by the usual mode of observing 
the transit of a star the observer listening to the 
beat of his clock fastens his attention upon the star at 
each beat and especially at the one immediately before 
and the one immediately after the passage of the 
thread and by this means he has these two positions 
and the position cff the thread so far present to his 
intuition at once that he can judge in what proportion 
the thread is nearer to one position than the other and 
can thus divide the intervening second in its due pro 
portion thus if he observe that at the beginning of 
the second the star is on one side of the thread and at 
the end of the second on the other side and that the 
two distances from the thread are as two to three he 
knows that the transit took place at twofifths or four 
tenths of a second after the former beat in this 
way a second of time in astronomical observations 
may by a skilful observer be divided into ten equal 



methods of observation 

parts although when time is observed as time a tenth 
of a second appears almost to escape our senses from 
the above explanation it will be seen that the reason 
why the subdivision is possible in the way thus de 
scribed is this — that the moment of time thus to be 
divided is so small that the eye and the mind can 
retain to the end of this moment the impression of 
position which it received at the beginning though 
the two positions of the star and the intermediate 
thread are seen successively they can be contemplated 
by the mind as if they were seen simultaneously find 
thus it is precisely the smallness of this portion of 
time which enables us to subdivide it by means of 
space 

 there is another case of somewhat a different 
kind in which time is employed in measuring space 
namely when space or the standard of space is de 
fined by the length of a pendulum oscillating in a given 
time we might in this way define any space by the 
time which a pendulum of such a length would take 
in oscillating and thus we might speak as was ob 
served by those who suggested this device of five 
minutes of cloth or a rope half an hour long we 
may observe however that in this case the space is 
not proportional to the time and we may add that 
plough we thus appear to avoid the arbitrary stand 
ard of space for as we have seen the standard of 
measures of time is a natural one we do not do so in 
fact for we assume the invariableness of gravity 
which really varies though very slightly from place 
to place 

 y the method of repetition in measure 
ment — many cases we can give great additional 
accuracy to our measurements by repeatedly adding 
to itself the quantity which we wish to measure thus 
if we wished to ascertain the exact breadth of a thread 
it might not be easy to determine whether it was one 
ninetieth or oneninetyfifth or onehundredth part of 
an inch but if we find that ninetysix such threads 
placed side by side occupy exactly an inch we have 
the precise measure of the breadth of the thread in 



 formation of science 

 

the same manner if two clocks are going nearly at the 
same rate yre may not be able to distinguish the ex 
cess of an oscillation of one of thfe pendulums over an 
oscillation of the other but when the two clocks have 
gone for an hour one of them may hstve gained ten 
seconds upon the other thus showing that the propor 
tion of their times of oscillation is to 

in the latter of these instances we have the princi 
ple of repetition truly exemplified because as has been 
justly observed by sir j herschel there is then ‘a 
juxtaposition of units without errour’ — ‘ one vibration 
commences exactly where the last terminates no part 
of time being lost or gained in the addition of the 
units so counted’ in space this juxtaposition of units 
without errour cannot be rigorously accomplished 
since the units must be added together by material 
contact as in the above case of the threads or in 
some equivalent manner yet the principle of repeti 
tion has been applied to angular measurement with 
considerable success in borda’s repeating circle in 
this instrument the angle between two objects which 
we have to observe is repeated along the graduated 
limb of the circle by turning the telescope from one 
object to the other alternately fastened to the circle 
by its clamp and loose from it by unclamping in 
this manner the errours of graduation may theoreti 
cally be entirely got rid of for if an angle repeated 
nine times be found to go twice round the circle it 
must be exactly eighty degrees and where the repeti 
tion does not give an exact number of circumferences 
it may still be made to subdivide the errour to any 
required extent 

 connected with the principle of repetition is 
the method of coincidences or interferences if we have 
two scales on one of which an inch is divided into 
and on the other into equal parts and if these 
scales bein placed side by side it appear that the 
beginning of the latter scale is between the nd and 
rd division of tlfe former it may not be apparent 


 disc nat phil art 



methods of observation 


 


what fraction added to determines the place of begin 
ning of the second scale as measured on the first but 
if it appear also that the rd division of the second 
scale coincides with a certain division of the first the 
th it is certain that and threetenths is the exact 
place of the beginning of the second scale measured 
on the first scale the rd division of the scale 
will coincide or interfere with a division of the 
scale when the beginning or zero of the divisions 
is threetenths of a division beyond the preceding line 
of the scale as will be plain on a little considera 
tion and if we have two scales of equal units in 
which each unit is divided into nearly but not quite 
the same number of equal parts as and and 
 and and one sliding on the other it will 
always happen that some one or other of the division 
lines will coincide or very nearly coincide and thus 
the exact position of the beginning of one unit mea 
sured on the other scale is determined a sliding 
scale thus divided for the purpose of subdividing the 
units of that on which it slides is called a vernier 
from the name of its inventor 

 the same principle of coincidence or interfer 
ence is applied to the exact measurement of the length 
of time occupied in the oscillation of a pendulum if 
a detached pendulum of such a length as to swing in 
little less than a second be placed before the seconds’ 
pendulum of a clock and if the two pendulums begin 
to move together the former will gain upon the latter 
and in a little while their moticftis will be quite dis 
cordant but if we go on watching we shall find 
them after a time to agree again exactly namely 
when the detached pendulum has gained one complete 
oscillation back and forwards upon the clock pendu 
lum and again coincides with it in its motion if this 
happen after minutes we know that the times of 
oscillation of the two pendulums are in he proportion 
of to and therefore thq detached pendulum 
oscillates in j of a second the accuracy which can 
be obtained in the measure of an oscillation by this 
means is great for the clock can be compared by 



 formation of science 

observing transits of the stars or otherwise with 
the natural standard of time the sidereal day and 
the moment of coincidence of the two pendulums 
may by proper arrangements be very exactly deter 
mined 

we have hitherto spoken of methods of measuring 
time and space but other elements also may be very 
precisely measured by various means 

 vi measurement of weight — weight like 
space and time is a quantity made up by addition of 
parts and may be measured by similar methods the 
principle of repetition is applicable to the measurement 
of weight for if two bodies be simultaneously put in 
the same pan of a balance and if they balance pieces in 
the other pan their weights are exactly added 

there may be difficulties of practical workmanship 
in carrying into effect the mathematical conditions of 
a perfect balance for example in securing an exact 
equality of the effective arms of the beam in all posi 
tions these difficulties are evaded by the method of 
double weighing according to which the standard 
weights and the body which is to be weighed are suc 
cessively put in the same pan and made to balance by 
a third body in the opposite scale by this means the 
different lengths of the arms of the beam and other 
imperfections of the balance become of no con sc 
quence b 

 there is no natural standard of weight the 
conventional weight taken as the standard is the 
weight of a given bulk of some known substance for 
instance a cubic foot of water but in order that this 
may be definite the water must not contain any por 
tion of heterogeneous substance hence it is required 
that the water be distilled water 

 vii measurement of secondary qualities — 
we have already seen that secondary qualities are 
estimated by means of conventional scales which refer 


 for other methods of measuring weights accurately see faraday’ cl ini 
cal manipulation p 

 b iii c ii of the measure of secondary qualities 



methods of observation 

them to space number or some other definite ex 
pression thus the thermometer measures heat the 
musical scale with or without the aid of number ex 
presses the pitch of a note and we may have an exact 
and complete scale of colours pure and impure we 
may remark however that with regard to sound and 
colour the estimates of the ear and the eye are not 
superseded but only assisted for if we determine 
what a note is by comparing it with an instrument 
known to be in tune we still leave the ear to decide 
when the note is in unison with one of the notes of the 
instrument and when we compare a colour with our 
chromatometer we judge by the ere which division 
of the cliromatometer it matches colour and sound 
have their natural scales which the eye and ear 
habitually apply what science’ requires is that those 
scales should be systematized we have seen that 
several conditions are requisite in such scales of qua 
lities the observer s skill and ingenuity are mainly 
shown in devising such scales and methods of applying 
them 

 the method of coincidences is employed in 
harmonics for if two notes are nearly but not quite 
in unison the coincidences of the vibrations produce 
an audible undulation in the note which is called the 
howlj and the exactness of the unison is known by 
this howl vanishing 

 viii manipulation— the process of ap 
plying practically methods of experiment and observa 
tion is termed manipulation and the value of obser 
vations depends much upon the proficiency of the 
observer in this art this skill appears as we have 
said not only in devising means and modes in measur 
ing results but also in inventing and executing ar 
rangements by which elements are subjected to such 
conditions as the investigation requires in finding and 
using some material combination by which nature shall 
be asked the question which we have in our ininds 
to do this in any subject may be considered as a pecu 
liar but especially in chemistry where ‘many 
experiments and even whole trains of research are 



l formation of science 

 

essentially dependent for success on mere manipu 
lation ’ the changes which the chemist hks to study 
— compositions decompositions and mutual actions 
affecting the internal structure rather than the ex 
ternal form and motion of bodies — arh not familiarly 
recognized by common observers as those actions are 
which operate upon the total mass of a body and 
hence it is only when the chemist has become to a 
certain degree familiar with his science that he has 
the power of observing he must learn to interpret 
the effects of mixture heat and other chemical agen 
cies so as to see in them those facts which chemistry 
makes the basis of her doctrines and in learning to 
interpret this language he must also learn to call it 
forth — to place bodies under the requisite conditions 
by the apparatus of his own laboratory and the opera 
tions of his own fingers to do this with readiness 
and precision is as we have said an art both of the 
mind and of the hand in no small degree recondite 
and difficult a person may be well acquainted with 
all the doctrines of chemistry and may yet fail in the 
simplest experiment how many precautions and ob 
servances what resource and invention what delicacy 
and vigilance are requisite in chemical manipulation 
may be seen by reference to dr faraday’s work on 
that subject c 

 the same qualities in the observer are requi 
site in some other departments of science for example 
in the researches of optics for in these after the first 
broad facts have been noticed the remaining features 
of the phenomena are both very complex and very 
minute and require both ingenuity in the invention 
of experiments and a keen scrutiny of their results 
we have instances of the application of these qualities 
in most of the optical experimenters of recent times 
and certainly in no one more than sir david brewster 
omitting here all notice of his succeeding labours his 
treatise on new philosophical instruments published 
in is an excellent model of the kind of resource 


faraday’s chemical manipulation p 



methods of observation ll 

and skill of which we now speak i may mention as 
an example of this skill his modesof determining the 
refractive power of an irregular fragment of any trans 
parent substance at first this might appear an im 
possible problem for it would seem that a regular and 
smooth surface are requisite in order that we may 
have any measurable refraction but sir david brew 
ster overcame the difficulty by immersing the fragment 
in a combination of fluids so mixed that they had the 
same refractive power as the specimen the question 
when they had this power was answered by noticing 
when the fragment became so transparent that its sur 
face could hardly be seen for this happened when the 
refractive power within and without the fragment being 
the same there was no refraction at the surface and this 
condition being obtain ed the refractive power of the fluid 
and therefore of the fragment was easily ascertained 

 ix the education of the senses — colour 

and musical tone are as we have seen determined by 
means of the senses whether or not systematical scales 
are used in expressing the observed fact systematical 
scales of sensible qualities however not only give pre 
cision to the record but to the observation but for 
this purpose such an education of the senses is requi 
site as may enable us to apply the scale immediately 
the memory must retain the sensation or perception 
to which the technical term or degree of the scale 
refers thus with regard to colour as we have said 
already when we find such terms as tinwhite or 
pinchbeckbrown the metallic colouf so denoted ought 
to occur at once to our recollection without delay or 
search the observer’s senses therefore must be edu 
cated at first by an actual exhibition of the standard 
and afterwards by a familiar use of it to understand 
readily and clearly each phrase and degree of the scales 
which in his observations he has to apply this is not 
only the best but in many cases the only way in which 
the observation can be expressed thus gtassy lustre 
fatty hi§tre adamantine lustre denote certain kinds of 


n b viii c hi terminology 


nov orq

 formation of science 

shining in minerals which appearances we should 
endeavour in vain to describe by periphrasis and 
which the terms if considered as terms in common 
language would by no means clearly discriminate for 
who in common language would say that coal has a 
fatty bistre but these terms in their conventional 
sense are perfectly definite and when the eye is once 
familiarized with this application of them are easily 
and clearly intelligible 

 the education of the senses which is thus 
requisite in order to understand well the terminology 
of any science must be acquired by an inspection of 
the objects which the science deals with and is per 
haps best promoted by the practical study of natural 
history in the different departments of natural 
history the descriptions of species are given by means 
of an extensive technical terminology and that educa 
tion of which we now speak ought to produce the effect 
of making the observer as familiar with each of the terms 
of this terminology as we are with the words of our 
common language the technical terms have a much 
more precise meaning than other terms since they are 
defined by express convention and not learnt by com 
mon usage merely yet though they are thus defined 
not tlie definition but the perception itself is that 
which the term suggests to the proficient 

in order to use the terminology to any good pur 
pose the student must possess it not as a dictionary 
but as a language the terminology of his sciences 
must be the natural historian’s most familiar tongue 
he must learn to think in such language and when 
this is achieved the terminology as have elsewhere 
said though to an uneducated eye cumbrous and 
pedantical is felt to be a useful implement not an op 
pressive burden the impatient schoolboy looks upon 
his grammar and vocabulary as irksome and burden 
some but the accomplished student who has learnt 
the language by means of them knows that they have 
given him the means of expressing what he thinks and 


 hist ind sc b xvi c iv sect 



methods of observation 

even of thinking more precisely and as the study of 
language thus gives precision to the thoughts the study 
of natural history and especially of the descriptive 
part of it gives precision to the senses 

the education of the senses is also greatly pro 
moted by the practical pursuit of any science of ex 
periment and observation as chemistry or astronomy 
the methods of manipulating of which we have just 
spoken in chemistry and the methods of measuring 
extremely minute portions of space and time which are 
employed in astronomy and which are described in 
the former part of this chapter are among the best 
modes of educating the senses for purposes of scientific 
observation 

 by the various methods of precise observation 
which we have thus very briefly descitbed facts are 
collected of an exact and definite kind they are then 
bound together in general laws by the aid of general 
ideas and of such methods as we have now to consider 
it is true that the ideas which enable us to combine 
facts into general propositions do commonly operate in 
our minds while we are still engaged in the office of 
observing ideas of one kind or other are requisite to 
connect our phenomena into facts and to give mean 
ing to the terms of our descriptions and it frequently 
happens that long before we have collected all the 
facts which induction requires the mind catches the 
suggestion which some of these ideas offer and leaps 
forwards to a conjectural law while the labour of obser 
vation is yet unfinished but though this actually 
occurs it is easy to see that the process of combining 
and generalizing facts is in the order of nature pos 
terior to and distinct from the process of observing 
facts not only is this so but there is an intermediate 
step which though inseparable from all successful 
generalization may be distinguished from it in our 
survey and may in some degree be assisted by pecu 
liar methods to the consideration of such methods 
we nojy proceed 



chapter iii 


of methods of acquiring clear scientific ideas 
and first of intellectual education 


l apihjrism xxix 

the method by which the acquisition of clear scientific 
ideas is promoted are mainly two intellectual education 
and discussion of ideas 

aphorism xxx 

the idea of space becomes more clear by studying geo 
metry the idea of force by studying mechanics the ideas 
of likeness of kind of subordination of classes by study ing 
natural history 


aphorism xxxi 

elementary mechanics should now form a part of intel 
lectual education in order that the student may understand 
the theory of universal gravitation for an intellectual 
education should cultivate such ideas as enable the student to 
understand the most complete and admirable portions of the 
knowledge which the human race has attained to 

aphorism xxxii 

natural history ought to form a part of intellectual edu 
cation in order to correct certain prejudices which arise from 
cultivating the intellect by means of mathematics alone and 
in order to lead the student to see that the division of things 
into kinds and the attribution and use of names are pro 
cesses susceptible of great precision 



intellectual education 

t he ways in which men become masters of those 
clear and yet comprehensive conceptions which 
the formation and reception of science require are 
mainly two which although we cannot reduce them 
to any exact scheme we may still in a loose use of 
the term call methods of acquiring clear ideas these 
two ways are education and discussion 

 i idea of space — it is easily seen that edu 
cation may do at least something to render our ideas 
distinct and precise to learn geometry in youth 
tends manifestly to render our idea of space clear and 
exact by such an education all the relations and all 
the consequences of this idea come to be readily and 
steadily apprehended and thus it becoipes easy for us 
to understand portions of science which otherwise we 
should by no means be able to comprehend the con 
ception of similar triangles was to be mastered before 
the disciples of thales could f sce the validity of his 
method of determining the height of lofty objects by 
the length of their shadows the conception of the 
sphere with its circles had to become familiar before 
the annual motion of the sun and its influence upon 
the lengths of days could be rightly traced the pro 
perties of circles combined with the pure doctrine of 
motion were required as an introduction to the theory 
of epicycles the properties of’ conic sections were 
needed as a preparation for the discoveries of kepler 
and not only was it necessary that men should possess 
a knowledge of certain figures and their properties but 
it was equally necessary that the should have the 
habit of reasonmg with perfect steadiness precision 
and conclusiveness concerning the relations of space 
no small discipline of the mind is requisite in most 
cases to accustom it to go with complete insight and 
security through the demonstrations respecting inter 
secting planes and lines dihedral and trihedral angles 
which occur in solid geometry yet how absolutely 
necessary is a perfect mastery of sqch reasonings to

same faculty to the student of crystallography with 
out mathematical habits of conception and of thinking 
these portions of science are perfectly inaccessible but 
the early study of plane and solid geometry gives to 
all tolerably gifted persons the habits which are thus 
needed the discipline of following the reasonings of 
didactic works on this subject till we are quite familiar 
with them and of devising for ourselves reasonings of 
the same kind as for instance the solutions of pro 
blems proposed soon gives the mind the power of dis 
coursing with perfect facility concerning the most 
complex and multiplied relations of space and enables 
us to refer to the properties of all plane and solid 
figures as surely as to the visible forms of objects 
thus we have here a signal instance of the efficacy of 
education in giving to our conceptions that clearness 
which the formation and existence of science indispen 
sably require 

 it is not my intention here to enter into the 
details of the form which should be given to education 
in order that it may answer the purposes now contem 
plated but i may make a remark which the above 
examples naturally suggest that in a mathematical 
education considered as a preparation for furthering 
or understanding physical science geometry is to bn 
cultivated far ratherhan algebra — the properties of 
space are to be studied and reasoned upon as they are 
in themselves not as they are replaced and disguised 
by symbolical representations it is true that when 
the student is become quite familiar with elementary 
geometry he may often enable himself to deal in a 
more rapid and comprehensive manner with the rela 
tions of space by using the language of symbols and 
the principles of symbolical calculation but this is an 
ulterior step which may be added to but can never be 
substituted for the direct cultivation of geometry 
the method of symbolical reasoning employed upon 
subjects of geometry and mechanics has certainly 
achieved some remarkable triumphs in the treatment 
of the theory of the universe these successful appli 



intellectual education 

cations of symbols in tbe highest problems of physical 
astronom appear to have made some teachers of mathe 
matics imagine that it is best to begin the pupil’s course 
with such symbolical generalities but this mode of 
proceeding will be so far from giving the student clear 
ideas of mathematical relations that it will involve 
him in utter confusion and probably prevent his ever 
obtaining a firm footing in geometry to commence 
mathematics in such a way would be much as if we 
should begin the study of a language by reading the 
highest strains of its lyrical poetry 

 ii idea of number i — the study of mathe 
matics as i need hardly observe developes and renders 
exact our conceptions of the relations of number as 
well as of space and although as we have already 
noticed even in their original form the conceptions of 
number are for the most part very distinct they may 
be still further improved by such discipline in com 
plex cases a methodical cultivation of the mind in such 
subjects is needed for instance questions concerning 
cycles and intercalations and epacts and the like 
require very great steadiness of arithmetical apprehen 
sion in ouder that the reasoner may deal with them 
rightly in the same manner a mastery of problems 
belonging to the science of pure motion or as i have 
termed it mechanism requires either great natural 
aptitude in the student or a mind properly disci 
plined by suitable branches of mathematical study 

 arithmetic and geometry have long been standard 
portions of the education of cultured persons through 
out the civilized world and hence all such persons have 
been able to accept and comprehend those portions of 
science which depend upon the idea of space for in 
stance the doctrine of the globular form of the earth 
with its consequences such as the measures of latitude 
and longitude — the heliocentric system of the universe 
in modern or the geocentric in ancient times — the 
explanation of the rainbow and the like in nations 
whgre l there is no such education these portions of 
science cannot exist as a part of the general stock of 
the knowledge of society however intelligently they

may be pursued by single philosophers dispersed here 
and there in the commnity 

 iii idea of force — as the idea of space is 
brought out in its full evidence by the study of geo 
metry so the idea of force is called up and developed 
by the study of the science of mechanics it has 
already been shown in our scrutiny of the ideas of the 
mechanical sciences that force the cause of motion 
or of equilibrium involves an independent fundamental 
idea and is quite incapable of being resolved into any 
mere modification of our conceptions of space time 
and motion and in order that the student may pos 
sess this idea in a precise and manifest shape he must 
pursue the science of mechanics in the mode which 
this view of its nature demands — that is he must 
study it as an independent science resting on solid 
elementary principles of its own and not built upon 
some other unmechanical science as its substructure 
he must trace the truths of mechanics from their own 
axioms and definitions these axioms and definitions 
being considered as merely means of bringing into 
play the idea on which the science depends the con 
ceptions of fotce and matter of action and inaction of 
momentum and inertia with the reasonings in which 
they are involved cannot be evaded by any substitu 
tion of lines or symbols for the conceptions any at 
tempts at such substitution would render the study of 
mechanics useless as a preparation of the mind for 
physical science and would indeed except counter 
acted by great natural clearness of thought on such 
subjects fill the mind with confused and vague notions 
quite unavailing for any purposes of sound reasoning 
but on the other hand the study of mechanics in its 
genuine form as a branch of education is fitted to give 
a most useful and valuable precision of thought on 
such subjects and is the more to be recommended 
since in the general habits of most men’s minds the 
mechanical exceptions are tainted with far greater ob 
scurity and perplexity than belongs to the conceptions 
of number space and motion 

 as habitually distinct conceptions of space and 



intellectual education 

motion were requisite for the reception of the doctrines 
of formal astronomy the ptolemaic and copernican 
system so a clear and steady conception of force is in 
dispensably necessary for understanding the newtonian 
system of physical astronomy it may be objected 
that the study of mechanics as a science has not 
commonly formed part of a liberal education in euro 
and yet that educated persons have commonly accepted 
the newtonian system put to this we reply that al 
though most persons of good intellectual culture have 
professed to assent to the newtonian system of the uni 
verse yet they have in fact entertained it in so vague 
and perplexed a manner s to show very clearly that a 
better mental preparation than the usual one is neces 
sary in order that such persons may really understand 
the doctrine of universal attraction i have elsewhere 
spoken of the prevalent indistinctness of mechanical 
conceptions and need not here dwell upon the indi 
cations constantly occurring in conversation and in 
literature of the utter inaccuracy of thought on such 
subjects which may often be detected for instancy in 
the mode in which many men speak of centrifugal and 
centripetal forces — of projectile and central forces— 
of the effect of the moon upon the waters of the ocean 
and the like the incoherence of ideas which we 
frequently witness on such points shows us clearly 
that in the minds of a great number of men well 
educated according to the present standard the accept • 
ance of the doctrine of universal gravitation is a result 
of traditional prejudice not of national conviction 
and those who are newtonians on such grounds are 
not at all more intellectually advanced by being new 
tonians in the nineteenth century than they would 
have been by being ptolemaics in the fifteenth 

 it is undoubtedly in the highest degree desirable 
that all great advances in science should become the 
common property of all cultivated men and this can 
only be done by introducing into the course of aliberal 
edqpatjon such studies as unfold and fix in men’s minds

the fundamental ideas upon which the newdiscovered 
truths rest the progress made by the ancients in 
geography astronomy and other sciences led them to 
assign wisely and well a place to arithmetic and geo 
metry among the steps of an ingenuous education the 
discoveries of modem times have rendered these steps 
sftll more indispensable for we cannot consider a man 
as cultivated up to the standard of his times if he is 
not only ignorant of but incapable of comprehending 
the greatest achievements of the human intellect and 
as innumerable discoveries of all ages have thus secured 
to geometry her place as a part of good education so 
the great discoveries of newton make it proper to in 
troduce elementary mechanics as a part of the same 
course if the education deserve to be called good 
the pupil will not remain ignorant of those discoveries 
the most remarkable extensions of the field of human 
knowledge which have ever occurred yet he cannot 
by possibility comprehend them except his mind be 
previously disciplined by mechanical studies the pe 
riod appears now to be arrived when we may venture 
or rather when we are bound to endeavour to include 
a new class of fundamental ideas in the elementary 
discipline of the human intellect this is indispensa 
ble if we wish to educe the powers which we know 
that it possesses and to enrich it with the wealth which 
lies within its reach 

 by the view which is thus presented to us of the 
nature and objects of intellectual education we are led 
to consider the miitd of man as undergoing a progress 
from age to age by the discoveries which are made 
and by the clearness and evidence which after a time 
not suddenly nor soon the truths thus discovered ac 
quire one portion of knowledge after another becomes 
elementary and if we would really secure this pro 
gress and make men share in it these new portions 
must be treated as elementary in the constitution of a

liberal education even in the rudest forms of intelli 
gence ma is immeasurably elevated above the unpro 
gressive brute for the idea of number is so far deve 
loped that he can count his flock or his arrows but 
when number is contemplated in a speculative form he 
has made a vast additional progress when he steadily 
apprehends the relations of space he has again ad 
vanced when in thought he carries these relations into 
the vault of the sky into the expanse of the universe 
he reaches a higher intellectual position and when 
he carries into these wide regions not only the rela 
tions of space and time but of cause and effect of 
force and reaction he has again made an intellectual 
advance which wide as it is at first is accessible to 
all and with which all should acquaint themselves if 
they really desire to prosecute with energy the ascend 
ing path of truth and knowledge which lies before 
them this should be an object of exertion to all in 
genuous and hopeful minds for that exertion is 
necessary — that after all possible facilities have been 
afforded i is still a matter of toil and struggle to 
appropriate to ourselves the acquisitions of great dis 
coverers is not to be denied elementary mechanics 
like elementary geometry is a study accessible to all 
but like that too or perhaps more than that it is a 
study which requires effort and contention of mind — a 
forced steadiness of thought it is long since one com 
plained of this labour in geometry and was answered ‘ 
that in that region there is no royal road the same 
is true of mechanics and must be true of all branches 
of solid education but we should express the truth 
more appropriately in our days by saying that there is 
no popular road to these sciences in the mind as 
in the body strenuous exercise alone can give strength 
and activity the art of exact thought can be acquired 
only by the labour of close thinking

arrived at a point of human progress in which a liberal

sides arithmetic elementary geometry and mechanics 



 


formation of science 


the question then occurs to us whether there are any 
other fundamental ideas among those belonging to 
other sciences which ought also to be made part of 
such an education — whether for example we should 
strive to develope in the minds of all cultured men 
the ideas of polarity mechanical and chemical of which 
we spoke in a former part of this work 

the views to which we have been conducted by the 
previous inquiry lead us to reply that it would not be 
well at present to make chemical polarities at any 
rate a subject of ’ elementary instruction for even 
the most profound and acute philosophers who have 
speculated upon this subject — they who are leading 
the van in the march of discovery — do not seem yet 
to have reduced their thoughts on this subject to a 
consistency or to have taken hold of this idea of po 
larity in a manner quite satisfactory to their own 
minds this part of the subject is therefore by no 
means ready to be introduced into a course of general 
elementary education for with a view to such a pur 
pose nothing less than the most thorough luminous 
and transparent condition of the idea will suffice its 
whole efficacy as a means and object of disciplinal 
study depends upon there being no obscurity per 
plexity or indefiniteness with regard to it beyond that 
transient deficiency which at first exists in the len 
er’s mind and is to be removed by his studies the 
idea of chemical polarity is not yet in this condition 
and therefore is not yet fit for a place in education 
yet since this idea f polarity is the most general idea 
which enters into chemistry and appears to be that 
which includes almost all the others it would be un 
philosophical and inconsistent with all sound views of 
science to introduce into education some chemical 
conceptions and to omit those which depend upon this 
idea indeed such a partial adoption of the science 
could hardly take place without not only omitting but 
misrepresenting a reat part of our chemical know 
ledge the conclusion to which we are necessarily 
led therefore is this — that at present chemistry can 



intellectual education 

not with any advantage form a portion of the general 
intellectual education 

 y naturalhistory ideas — but there re 

mains still another class of ideas with regard to 
which we may very properly ask whether they may 
not advantageously form a portion of a liberal educa 
tion i mean the ideas of definite resemblance and 
difference and of one set of resemblances subordinate 
to another which form the bases of the classificatory 
sciences these ideas are developed by the study of 
the various branches of natural history as botany 
and zoology and beyond all doubt those pursuits if 
assiduously followed very materially affect the mental 
habits there is this obvious advantage to be looked 
for from the study of natural history considered as 
a means of intellectual discipline — that it gives us in 
a precise and scientific form examples of the classing 
and naming of objects which operations the use of 
common language leads us constantly to perform in a 
loose and inexact • way in the usual habits of our 
minds and tongues things are distinguished or brought 
together and names are applied in a manner very in 
definite vacillating and seemingly capricious and we 
may naturally be led to doubt whether such defects 
can be avoided — whether exact distinctions of things 
and rigorous use of words be possible now upon this 
point we may receive the instruction of natural his 
tory which proves to us by the actual performance of 
the task that a precise classification and nomenclature 
are attainable at least for a mass f objects all of the 
same kind further we also learn from this study 
that there may exist not only an exact distinction of 
kinds of things but a series of distinctions one set 
subordinate to another and the more general including 


 do not here op to prove that fore cannot even understand the

which the memory only retains the pressed of no value whatever to 

verbal repression of results while the intellect but rather is highly 

the mind does not apprehend the hurtful to the habits of thinking and 

principles of the subjeot and there reasoning 



 formation of science 

the more special so as to form a system of classifica 
tion all these are valuable lessons if bythe study 
of natural history we evolve in a clear and well de 
fined form the conceptions of genus species and of 
higher and lower steps of classification f we communi 
cate precision clearness and method to the intellect 
through a great range of its operations 

 it must be observed that in order to attain the 
disciplinal benefit which the study of natural history 
is fitted to bestow we must teach the natural not the 
artificial classifications or at least the natural as well 
as the artificial for it is important for the student to 
perceive that there are classifications not merely arbi 
trary founded upon some assumed character but na 
tural recognized by some discovered character he ought 
to see that our classes being collected according to one 
mark are confirmed by many marks not originally stated 
in our scheme and are thus found to be grouped 
together not by a single resemblance but by a mass of 
resemblances indicating a natural affinity that ob 
jects may be collected into such groups is a highly im 
portant lesson which natural history alone pursued 
as the science of natural classes can teach 

 natural history has not unfrequently been 
made a portion of education and has in some degree 
produced such effects as we have pointed out it 
would appear however that its lessons have for the 
most part been very imperfectly learnt or understood 
by persons of ordinary education and that there are 
perverse intellectuasl habits very commonly prevalent 
in the cultivated classes which ought ere now to have 
been corrected by the general teaching of natural 
history we may detect among speculative men 
many prejudices respecting the nature and rules of 
reasoning which arise from pure mathematics having 
been so long and so universally the instrument of in 
tellectual cultivation pure mathematics reasons from 
definitibns whatever term is introduced into her 
pages as a circle oia square its definition comes along 
with it and this definition is supposed to supply all 
that the reasoner needs to know respecting the term 



intellectual education 


 


if there be any doubt concerning the validity of the 
conclusion the doubt is resolved by recurring to the 
definitions hence it has come to pass that in other 
subjects also men seek for and demand definitions as 
the most secure foundation of reasoning the defini 
tion and the term defined are conceived to be so far 
identical that in all cases the one may be substituted 
•for tjie other and such a substitution is held to be 
the best mode of detecting fallacies 

 jt has already been shown that even geometry 
is not founded upon definitions alone and we shall 
not here again analyse the fallacy ef this belief in the 
supreme value of definitions but we may remark 
that the study of natural history appears to be the 
proper remedy for this erroneous habit ot thought for 
in every department of natural history the object of 
our study is kinds of things not one of which kinds 
can be rigorously defined yet all of them are suffi 
ciently definite in these cases we may indeed give a 
specific description of one of the kinds and may call it 
a definition but it is clear that such a definition does 
not contain the essence of the tiling we say that the 
bose tribe are ‘ polypetalous dicotyledons with lateral 
styles superior simple ovaria regular perigynous sta 
mens exalbuminous definite seeds and alternate stipu 
late leaves but no one would say that this was our 
essential conception of a rose to be substituted for it 
in all cases of doubt or obscurity by way of making 
our reasonings perfectly clear not only so but as 
we • have already seen the definitkm does not even 
apply to all the tribe for the stipulse are absent in 
lowea the albumen is present in neillia the fruit of 
spiraea sorbifolia is capsular if then we can possess 
any certain knowledge in natural history which no 
cultivator of the subject will doubt it is evident that 
our knowledge cannot depend on the possibility of lay 
ing down exact definitions and reasoning from them 

 but it may be asked if we cannot define a 


 lindley’s nat syst bot p 

 hist sc ideas b viii c ii sect 



 formation of science 

word or a class of things which a word denotes how 
can we distinguish what it does mean from what it 
does not mean how can we say that it signifies one 
thing rather than another except we declare what is 
its signification 

the answer to this question involves the general 
principle of a natural method of plassification which 
has already been stated and need not here be again 
dwelt on it has been shown that names of kinds of 
things genera associate them according to total re 
semblances not partial characters the principle 
which connects a group of objects in natural history is 
not a definition but a type thus we take as the type 
of the rose family it may be the common wild rose 
all species which resemble this flower more than they 
resemble any other group of species are also roses and 
form one genus all genera which resemble roses 
more than they resemble any other group of genera 
are of the same family and thus the rose family 
is collected about some one species which is the type 
or central point of the group 

in such an arrangement it may readily be conceived 
that though the nucleus of each group may cohere 
firmly together the outskirts of contiguous groups 
may approach and may even be intermingled so that 
some species may doubtfully adhere to one group or 
another yet this uncertainty does not at all affect 
the truths which we find ourselves enabled to assert 
with regard to the general mass of each group and 
thus we are taughu that there may be very important 
differences between two groups of objects although we 
are unable to tell where the one group ends and where 
the other begins and that there may be propositions 
of indisputable truth in which it is impossible to give 
unexceptionable definitions of the terms employed 

 these lessons are of the highest value with 
regard to all employments of the human mind for the 
mode in which words in common use acquire their 
meaning approaches far more nearly to the method of 


 hist sc ideas b viil c ii sect 



intellectual education 


 


type than to the method of definition the terms 
which bettmg to our practical concerns or to our spon 
taneous and unscientific speculations are rarely capable 
of exact definition they have been devised in order 
to express assertions often very important yet very 
vaguely conceived and the signification of the word is 
extended as far as the assertion conveyed by it can be 
 extended by apparent connexion or by analogy and 
thus in all the attempts of man to grasp at knowledge 
we have an exemplification of that which we have 
stated as the rule of induction that definition and 
proposition are mutually dependent each adjusted so 
as to give value and meaning to th other and this is 
so even when both the elements of trufh are defective 
in precision the definition being replaced by an in 
complete description or a loose reference to a type 
and the proposition being in a corresponding degree 
insecure 

 thus the study of natural history as a cor 
rective of the belief tha definitions are essential to 
substantial truth might be of great use and the ad 
vantage which might thus be obtained is such as well 
entitles this study to a place in a liberal education 
we may further observe that in order that natural 
history may produce such an effect it must be studied 
by inspection of the objects themselves and not by the 
reading of books only its lesson is that we must in 
all cases of doubt or obscurity refer not to words or 
definitions but to things the book of nature is its 
dictionary it is there that the natural historian looks 
to find the meaning of the words which he uses so 


 it is a curious example of the 
influence of the belief in definitions 
that elementary books have been 
written in which natural history is 
taught in the way of question and 
answer and consequently by means of 
word alojte in such a scheme of 
course all objects are defined and we 
may easily anticipate the value of 
nov qpg 


the knowledge thus conveyed thus 
‘iron is a wellknown hard metal of 
a darkish gray colour and very elas 
tic’ ‘copper is an orangecoloured 
metal more sonorous than cay other 
and the nysfc elastic of any except 
iron’ this is to pervert the meaning 
of education and to make it a busi 
ness of mere words 


 



i formation ov science 

long as a plant in its most essential parts is more like 
a rose than any thing else it is a rose he fenows no 
other definition 

 vi wellestablished ideajs alone to be used — 
we may assert in general what we have elsewhere as 
above stated specially with reference to the fundamental 
principles of chemistry — no ideas are suited to become 
the elements of elementary education till they have not 
only become perfectly distinct and fixed in the minds 
of the leading cultivators of the science to which they 
belong but till they have been so for some considerable 
period the entire clearness and steadiness of view 
which is essential tp sound science must have time to 
extend itself to t a wide circle of disciples the views 
and principles which are detected by the most profound 
and acute philosophers are soon appropriated by all the 
most intelligent and active minds of their own and of 
the following generations and when this has taken 
place and not till then it is right by a proper con 
stitution of our liberal education to extend a general 
knowledge of such principles to all cultivated persons 
and it follows from this view of the matter that we 
are by no means to be in haste to adopt into our 
course of education all new discoveries as soon as they 
are made they require some time in order to settle 
into their proper place and position in men’s minds 
and to show themselves under their true aspects and 
till this is done we confuse and disturb rather than 
enlighten and unfold the ideas of learners by intro 
ducing the discoveries into our elementary instruction 
hence it was perhaps reasonable that a century should 
elapse from the time of galileo before the rigorous 
teaching of mechanics became a general element of in 
tellectual training and the doctrine of universal gra 
vitation was hardly ripe for such an employment till 
the end of the last century we must not direct the 
unforiped youthful mind to launch its little bark upon 
the waters of speculation till all the agitation of dis 
covery with its consequent fluctuation and contro 
versy has well subsided 

 but it may be asked how is it that time ope

rates to give distinctness and evidence to scientific 
ideas n what way does it happen that views and 
principles obscure and wavering at first after a while 
become luminous and steady can we point out any 
process any intermediate steps by which this result is 
produced if we can this process must be an impor 
tant portion of the subject now under our consideration 

to this we reply that the transition from the hesi 
tation and contradiction with which true ideas are first 
received to the general assent and clear apprehension 
which they afterwards obtain takes place through 
the circulation of various arguments for and against 
them and various modes of presenting and testing 
them all which we may include under the term dis 
cussion which we have already mentioned as the 
second of the two ways by which scientific views are 
developed into full maturity

chapter iv 


of methods of acquiring clear scientific ideas 
continued — of the discussion of ideas 


aphorism xxxiii 

the conceptions involved in scientific truths have attained 
the requisite degree of clearness by means of the discussions 
respecting ideas which have taken place among discoverers 
and their followers such discussions are very far from 
being unprofitable to science they are metaphysical and 
must be so the difference between discoverers and barren 
reasoners is that the former employ good and the latter bad 
metaphysics 

i tt is easily seen that in every part of science the 

x establishment of a new set of ideas has been ac 
companied with much of doubt and dissent and by 
means of discussions so occasioned the new conoep 
tions and the opinions which involve them have gra 
dually become definite and clear the authors and 
asserters of the ne opinions in order to make them 
defensible have been compelled to make them consist 
ent in order to recommend them to others they have 
been obliged to make them more entirely intelligible 
to themselves and thus the terms which formed the 
main points of the controversy although applied in a 
loose and vacillating manner at first have in the end 
become perfectly definite and exact the opinions dis 
cussed c have been in their main features the same 
throughout the debate but they have at first been 
dimly and at last clearly apprehended like the objects 
of a landscape at which we look through a telescope 
ill adjusted till by sliding the tube backwards and 



discussion of ideas ll 

forwards we at last bring it into focus and perceive 
every feature of the prospect sharp and bright 

 we have in the last book fully exempli 
fied this gradual progress of conceptions from obscu 
rity to clearness by means of discussion we have 
seen too that this mode of treating the subject has 
never been successful except when it has been asso 
ciated with an appeal to facts as well as to reasonings 
a combination of experiment with argument of ob 
servation with demonstration has always been found 
requisite in order that men should arrive at those dis 
tinct conceptions which give them substantial truths 
the arguments used led to the rejection of undefined 
ambiguous selfcontradictory notion but the refer 
ence to facts led to the selection or at least to the re 
tention of the conceptions which were both true and 
usefill the two correlative processes definition and 
true assertion the formation of clear ideas and the in 
duction of laws went on together 

thus those discussions by which scientific concep 
tions are rendered ultimately quite distinct and fixed 
include both reasonings from principles and illustra 
tions from facts at present we turn our attention 
more peculiarly to the former part of the process ac 
cording to the distinction already drawn between the 
 explication of conceptions and the colligation of facts 
the discussions of which we here speak are the me 
thod if they may be called a method by which the 
explication of conceptions is carried to the requisite 
point among philosophers 

 in the history of the fundamental ideas of the 
sciences which forms the prelude to this work and 
in the history of the inductive sciences i have in 
several instances traced the steps by which histori 
cally speaking these ideas have obtained their ulti 
mate and permanent place in the minds of speculative 
men i have thus exemplified the reasonings apd con 
troversies which constitute such discussion as we now 
sppak of i have stated at considerable length the

various attempts failures and advances by which the 
ideas which enter into the science of mechanics were 
evolved into their present evidence in like manner 
we have seen the conception of refracted rays of light 
obscure and confused in seneca growing clearer in 
roger bacon more definite in descartes perfectly dis 
tinct in newton the polarity of light at first con 
templated with some perplexity became very distinct 
to malus young and fresnel yet the phenomena of 
circular polarization and still more the circular pola 
rization of fluids leave us even at present some dif 
ficulty in fully mastering this conception the related 
polarities of electricity and magnetism are not yet 
fully comprehended even by our greatest philosophers 
one of mr faraday’s late papers the fourteenth se 
ries of his researches is employed in an experimental 
discussion of this subject which leads to no satisfactory 
result the controversy between mm biot and am 
pere on the nature of the elementary forces in elec 
trodynamic action is another evidence that the discus 
sion of this subject has not yet reached its termination 
with regard to chemical polarity i have already stated 
that this idea is as yet very far from being brought to 
an ultimate condition of definiteness and the subject 
of chemical forces for that whole subject must be in 
cluded in this idea of polarity which has already t oc 
casioned much perplexity and controversy may easily 
occasion much more before it is settled to the satis 
faction of the philosophical world the ideas of the 
classiflcatory sciences also have of late been undergoing 
much and very instructive discussion in the contro 
versies respecting the relations and offices of the na 
tural and artificial methods and with regard to phy 
siological ideas it would hardly be too much to say 
that the whole history of physiology up to the present 
time has consisted of the discussion of the fundamental 
ideas of the science such as yital forces nutrition 
reproduction andthe like we had before us at 
some length in the history of scientific ideas a review 


 hist ind sc b xiii c 



discussion of ideas 


 

of the opposite opinions which have been advanced 
on this subject and we attempted in some degree to 
estimate the direction in which these ideas are perma 
nently settling but without attaching any importance 
to this attempt the account there given may at least 
serve to show how important a share in the past pro 

f ress of this subject the discussion of its fundamental 
deas has hitherto had 

 there is one reflexion which is very pointedly 
suggested by what has been said the manner in 
which our scientific ideas acquire their distinct and 
ultimate form being such as has been described — 
always involving much abstract reasoning and analysis 
of our conceptions often much opposite argumentation 
and debate — how unphilosophical is it to speak of 
abstraction and analysis of dispute and controversy as 
frivolous and unprofitable processes by which true 
science can never be benefitted and how erroneous 
to put such employments in antithesis with the study 
of facts 

yet some writers are accustomed to talk with con 
tempt of all past controversies and to wonder at the 
blindness of those who did not at first take the view 
which was established at last such persons forget 
that it was precisely the controversy which established 
 airong speculative men that final doctrine which they 
themselves have quietly accepted it is true they 
have had no difficulty in thoroughly adopting the’ 
truth but that has occurred because all dissentient 
doctrines have been suppressed and forgotten and be 
cause systems and books and language itself have 
been accommodated peculiarly to the expression of 
the accepted truth to despise those who have by 
their mental struggles and conflicts brought the sub 
ject into a condition in which err our is almost out of 
our reach is to be ungrateful exactly in proportion to 
the amount of the benefit received it is as if a child 
when its teacher had with many trials and much 
trouble prepared a telescope so that the vision through 
it was distinct should wonder at his stupidity in push 
ing the tube of the eyeglass out and in so often 



 formation of science 

g again some persons condemn all that we have 
here spoken of as the discussion of ideas terming it 
metaphysical and in this spirit one writer has 
spoken of the ‘ metaphysical period’ of each science 
as preceding the period of ‘ positive knowledge but 
as we have seen that process which is here termed 
c metaphysical’ — the analysis of our conceptions anjd 
the exposure of their inconsistencies — accompanied 
with the study of facts — has always gone on most 
actively in the most prosperous periods of each science 
there is in galileo kepler gassendi and the other 
fathers of mechanical philosophy as much of meta 
physics as in their adversaries the main difference 
is that the metaphysics is of a better kind it is more 
conformable to metaphysical truth and the same is 
the case in other sciences nor can it be otherwise 
for all truth before it can be consistent with acts 
must be consistent with itself and although this rule 
is of undeniable authority its application is often far 
from easy the perplexities and ambiguities which 
arise from our having the same idea presented to us 
under different aspects are often difficult to disen 
tangle and no common acuteness and steadiness of 
thought must be expended on the task it would be 
easy to adduce from the works of all great discoverers 
passages more profoundly metaphysical than any which 
are to be found in the pages of barren a priori reasoners 

 as we have said these metaphysical discussions 
are not to be put in opposition to the study of facts 
but are to be stimulated nourished and directed by a 
constant recourse to experiment and observation the 
cultivation of ideas is to be conducted as having for 
its object the connexion of facts never to be pursued 
as a mere exercise of the subtil ty of the mind striving 
to build up a world of its own and neglecting that 
which exists about us for although man may in this 
way please himself and admire the creations of his 
own brain he can never by this course hit upon the

the methods by which the former of these two pro 
cesses is to be promoted we have now to explain the 
methods which science employs in order most success 
fully to execute the latter but he colligation of 
facts as already stated may offer to two steps of 
a very different kind — the laws of phenomena and 
their causes we shall first describe some of the 
methods employed in obtaining truths of the former of 
these two kinds 



chapter v 


analysis of the process of induction 


aphorism xxxiv 

the process of induction may be resolved into three steps 
the selection of the idea the construction of the concep 
tion and the determination of the magnitudes 

aphorism xxxy 

these three steps correspond to the determination of the 
independent variable the formula and the coefficients 
in mathematical investigations or to the argument the 
law and the numerical data in a table of an astrono 
mical or other inequality 

aphorism xxxyi 

the selection of the idea depends mainly upon inventive 
sagacity which operates by suggesting and trying various 
hypotheses some inquirers try erroneous hypotheses and 
thus exhausting the forms of errour form the prelude to 
discovery 

aphorism xxxvii 

the following rules may be given in order to the selection 
of the idea for purposes of induction — the idea and the 
facts must be homogeneous and the rule must be tested 
by the facts 

sect i — the three steps of induction 

i vxthen facts have been decomposed and phe 
 f noinena measured the philosopher endea 
vours to combine them into general laws by the aid of 



analysis of the process of induction 

ideas and conceptions these being illustrated and re 
gulated by fuch means as we have spoken of in the last 
two chapters in this task of gathering laws of nature 
from observed facts as we have already said the na 
tural sagacity of gifted minds is the power by which 
the greater part of the successful results have been 
obtained and this power will probably always be more 
efficacious than any method can be still there are 
certain methods of procedure which may in such in 
vestigations give us no inconsiderable aid and these i 
shall endeavour to expound 

 for this purpose i remark that the colligation 
of ascertained facts into general propositions may be 
considered as containing three steps which i shall 
term the selection of the idea the construction of the 
conception and the determination of the magnitudes 
it will be recollected that by the word idea or funda 
mental idea used in a peculiar sense i mean certain 
wide and general fields of intelligible relation such as 
space number cause likeness while by conception 
i denote more special modifications of these ideas as a 
circle a square number a uniform force a like form of 
flower now in order to establish any law by reference 
to facts we must select the true idea and the true 
conception for example when hipparchus found 
tfyat the distance of the bright star spica yirginis from 
the equinoxial point had increased by two degrees in 
about two hundred years and desired to reduce this 
change to a law he had first to assign if possible’ the 
idea on which it depended — whethdfc it was regulated 
for instance by space or by time whether it was de 
termined by the positions of other stars at each mo 
ment or went on progressively with the lapse of ages 
and when there was found reason to select time as the 
regulative idea of this change it was then to be deter 
mined how the change went on with the time — 
whether uniformly or in some other manner thbw 
ception or the rule of the progression was £ be 


 b il c vi 

 hist ind sc b iii c iv sect 



 formation of science 

rightly constructed finally it being ascertained that 
the change did go on uniformly the question then 
occurred what was its amount — whether exactly a 
degree in a century or more or less and how much 
and thus the determination of the magnitude com 
pleted the discovery of the law of phenomena respect 
ing this star 

 steps similar to these three may be discerned 
in all other discoveries of laws of nature thus in 
investigating the laws of the motions of the sun moon 
or planets we find that these motions may be resolved 
besides a uniform motion into a series of partial mo 
tions or inequalities and for each of these inequalities 
we have to learn upon what it directly depends whe 
ther upon the progress of time only or upon some con 
figuration of the heavenly bodies in space then we have 
to ascertain its law and finally we have to determine 
what is its amount in the case of such inequalities 
the fundamental element on which the inequality de 
pends is called by mathematicians the argument and 
when the inequality has been fully reduced to known 
rules and expressed in the form of a table the argu 
ment is the fundamental series of numbers which 
stands in the margin of the table and by means of 
which we refer to the other numbers which express 
the inequality thus in order to obtain from a solar 
table the inequality of the sun’s annual motion the 
argument is the number which expresses the day of 
the year the inequalities for each day being in the 
table ranged in a line corresponding to the days 
moreover the argument of an inequality being as 
sumed to be known we must in order to calculate the 
table that is in order to exhibit the law of nature 
know also the law of the inequality and its amount 
and the investigation of these three things the argu 
ment the law and the a mount of the inequality 
repiplents the three steps above described the selec 
tion of the idea the construction of the conception 
and the determination of the magnitude 

 in a great body of cases matheijiatical language 
and calculation are used to express the connexion be 



analysis of he process of induction 

tween the general law and the special facts and when 
this is don the three steps above described may be 
spoken of as the selection of the independent variable 
the cpnstruction of the formula and the determina 
tion of the coefficients it may be worth our while to 
attend to an exemplification of this suppose then 
that in such observations as we have just spoken of 
ftamely the shifting of a star from its place in the 
heavens by an unknown law astronomers had at the 
end of three successive years found that the star had 
removed by by and by minutes from its ori 
ginal place suppose it to be ascertained also by 
methods of which we shall hereafter treat that this 
change depends upon the time we must then take the 
time which we may denote by the symbol t for the 
independent variable but though the star changes 
its place with the time the change is not proportional 
to the time for its motion which is only minutes in 
the first year is minutes in the second year and 
ill the third but it is not difficult for a person a little 
versed in mathematics to perceive that the series 
 may be obtained by means of two terms one of 
which is proportional to the time and the other to the 
square of the time that is it is expressed by the for 
mula at bit the question then occurs what are the 
vluqs of the coefficients a and b and a little examina 
tion of the case shows us that a must be and b 
so that the formula is t tt indeed if we add to 
gether the series which expresses a change 
proportional to the time and which is propor 
tional to the square of the time we obtain the series 
 which is the series of numbers given by obser 
vation and thus the three steps which give us the 
idea the conception and the magnitudes or the 
argument the law and the amount of the change 
give us the independent variable the formula and 
the coefficients respectively 

we now proceed to offer some suggestions of methods 
by which each of these steps may be in some degree 
promoted

i 


sect ii — of the selection of the fundamental idea 

 when we turn ur thoughts upon any assem 
blage of facts with a view of collecting from them 
some connexion or law the most important step and 
at the same time that in which rules can least aid us is 
the selection of the idea by which they are to be 
collected so long as this idea has not been detected 
all seems to be hopeless confusion or insulated facts 
when the connecting idea has been caught sight of we 
constantly regard the facts with reference to their 
connexion and wonder that it should be possible for 
any one to consider them in any other point of view 

thus the different seasons and the various aspects 
of the heavenly bodies might at first appear to be 
direct manifestations from some superior power which 
man could not even understand but it was soon found 
that the ideas of time and space of motion and recur 
rence would give coherency to many of the pheno 
mena yet this took place by successive steps eclipses 
for a long period seemed to follow no law and being 
very remarkable events continued to be deemed the 
indications of a supernatural will after the common 
motions of the heavens were seen to be governed by 
relations of time and space at length however the 
chaldeans discovered that after a period of eighteen 
years similar sets of eclipses recur and thus selecting 
the idea of time simply as that to which these events 
were to be referred they were able to reduce them to 
rule and from that time eclipses were recognized as 
parts of a regular order of things we may in the 
same manner consider any other course of events and 
may enquire by what idea they are bound together 
for example if we take the weather years peculiarly 
wet or dry hot and cold productive and unproductive 
follow each other in a manner which at first sight at 
least seems utterly lawless and irregular now can we 
in any way discover some rule and order in these 
occurrences is there for example in these ’ events 
as in eclipses a certain cycle of years after which like 



analysis of the process of induction i 

seasons come round again or does the weather depend 
upon the fojce of some extraneous body — for instance 
the moon— and follow in some way her aspects or 
would the most proper way of investigating this subject 
be to consider the effect of the moisture and heat of 
various tracts of the earths surface upon the ambient 
air it is at our choice to try these and other modes 
f obtaining a science of the weather that is we may 
refer the phenomena to the idea of time introducing 
the conception of a cycle — or to the idea of external 
force by the conception of the moon’s action — or to the 
idea of mutual action introducing the conceptions of 
thermotical and atmological agencies operating between 
different regions of earth water and sir 

 it may be asked how are we to decide in such 
alternatives how are we to select the one right idea 
out of several conceivable ones to which we can only 
reply that this must be done by trying which will suc 
ceed if there really exist a cycle of the weather as 
well as of eclipses this must be established by comparing 
the asserted cycle with a good register of the seasons 
of sufficient extent or if the moon really influence 
the meteorological conditions of the air the asserted 
influence must be compared with the observed facts 
and so accepted or rejected when hipparchus had 
observed the increase of longitude of the stars the idea 
of a motion of the celestial sphere suggested itself as 
the explanation of the change but this thought was 
verified only by observing several star it was con 
ceivable that each star should have an independent 
motion governed by time only or by other circum 
stances instead of being regulated by its place in the 
sphere and this possibility could be rejected by trial 
alone in like manner the original opinion of the 
composition of bodies supposed the compounds to derive 
their properties from the elements according to the law 
of likeness but this opinion was overturned by a 
thousand facts and thus the really applicable ’idea 
of chemical composition was introduced in modern 
times in what has already been said on the histoiy 
of ideas we have seen how each science was in a state 



 


formation of science 


of confusion and darkness till the right idea was in 
troduced j 

 no general method of evolving such ideas can be 
given such events appear to result from a peculiar 
sagacity and felicity of mind — never ‘without labour 
never without preparation et with no constant de 
pendence upon preparation or upon labour or even 
entirely upon personal endowments newton explained 
the colours which refraction produces by referring 
each colour to a peculiar angle of refraction thus intro 
ducing the right idea but when the same philosopher 
tried to explain the colours produced by diffraction he 
erred by attempting to apply the same idea the course 
of a single ray instead of applying the truer idea of 
the interference of two rays newton gave a wrong 
rule for the double refraction of iceland spar by 
making the refraction depend on the edges oi the rhom 
bohedron huyghens more happy introduced the 
idea of the axis of symmetry of the solid and thus was 
able to give the true law of the phenomena 

 although the selected idea is proved to be the 
right one only when the true law of nature is esta 
blished by means of it yet it often happens that there 
prevails a settled conviction respecting the relation 
which must afford the key to the phenomena before 
the selection has been confirmed by the laws to which 
it leads even before the empirical laws of the tides 
were made’ out it was not doubtful dihat these laws 
depended upon ‘die places and motions of the sun and 
moon we know that the crystalline form of a body 
must depend upon its chemical composition though 
we are as yet unable to assign the law of this de 
pendence 

indeed in most cases of great discoveries the right 
idea to which the facts were to be referred was se 
lected by many philosophers before the decisive demon 
stration that it was the right idea was given by the 
discoverer thus newton showed that the motions of 
the planets might be explained by means of a central 
force in the sun but though he established he did not 
first select the idea involved in the conception of a 



analysis of the process of induction i 

central force the idea had already been sufficiently 
pointed cit dimly by kepler more clearly by borelli 
huyghens wren and hooke indeed this anticipa 
tion of the trap idea is alway a principal part of that 
which in the history of the sciences we have termed 
the prelude of a discovery the two steps of propos 
ing a philosophical problem and of solving it are as 
we have elsewhere said both important and are often 
performed by different persons the former step is in 
fact the selection of the idea in explaining any 
change we have to discover first the argument and 
then the law of the change the selection of the 
aigument is the step of which we jiere speak and is 
that in which inventiveness of mind ind justness of 
thought are mainly shown 

 although as we have sid we can give few pre 
cise directions for this cardinal process the selection of 
the idea in speculating on phenomena yet there is 
one rule which may have its use it is this — the idea 
and the facts must be homogeneous the elementary 
conceptions into which the facts have been decom 
posed must be of the same nature as the idea by 
which we attempt to collect them into laws thus if 
facts have been observed and measured by reference to 
space they must be bound together by the idea of 
space if we would obtain a knowledge pf mechanical 
forces in the solar system we must observe mechanical 
phenomena kepler erred against this rule in his 
attempts at obtaining physical laws of the system for 
the facts which he took were the‘ velocities not the 
changes of velocity which are really the mechanical 
facts again there has been a transgression of this 
rule committed by all chemical philosophers who have 
attempted to assign the relative position of the ele 
mentary particles of bodies in their component mole 
cules for their purpose has been to discover the 
relations of the particles in space and yet thy have 
neglected the only facts in the constitution of bodies 
wlch have a reference to space — namely crystalline 
form and optical properties no progress can be made 
in the theory of the elementary structure of bodies 
nov opfi 



formation of science 


 

without making these classes of facts the main basis of 
our speculations 

 the only other rule which i have to offer on 
this subject is that whih i have already given — the 
idea must be tested by the facts it must be tried by 
applying to the facts the conceptions which are derived 
from the idea and not accepted till some of these suc 
ceed in giving the law of the phenomena the justice 
of the suggestion cannot be known otherwise than by 
making the trial if we can discover a true law by 
employing any conceptions the idea from which these 
conceptions are derived is the right one nor can there 
be any proof of its rightness so complete and satisfac 
tory as that wp are by it led to a solid and permanent 
truth 

this however can jiardly be termed a rule for 
when we would know to conjecture and to try the 
truth of our conjecture by a comparison with the facts 
is the natural and obvious dictate of common sense 

supposing the idea which we adopt or which we 
would try to be now fixed upon we still have before 
us the range of many conceptions derived from it 
many formulae may be devised depending on the same 
independent yariable and we must v consider how 
our selection among these is to be made

general rules for the construction of the 
concetti on 


aphorism xxxviii 

the construction of ike conception very tflen includes in 
a great measure the determination of the magnitudes 

aphorism xxxix 

when a series of progressive numbers is given as the 
result of observation it may generally be reduced to law by 
combinations of arithmetical and geometrical progressions 

aphorism xl 

a true formula for a progressive series of numbers cannot 
commonly be obtained from a narrow range of observations 

apnorism xli 

recurrent series of numbers must in most cases be ex 
pressed by circular formulae 

aphorism xlii 

the true construction of the conception is frequently sug 
gested by some hypothesis and in these cases the hypothesis 
may be useful though containing superfluous parts 

i tn speaking of the discovery of law of nature 

x those which depend upon quantity as number 
space and the like are most prominent and most easily 
conceived and therefore in speaking of such researches 
we shall often use language which applies peculiarly to 

— 



 formation of science 

the cases in which quantities numerically measurable 
are concerned leaving it for a subsequent trsk to ex 
tend our principles to ideas of other kinds 

hence we may at present consider the construction 
of a conception which shall include and connect the 
facts as being the construction of a mathematical for 
mula coinciding with the numerical expression of the 
facts and we have to consider how this process can be 
facilitated it being supposed that we have already be 
fore us the numerical measures given by observation 

 we may remark however that the construction 
of the right formula for any such case and the deter 
mination of the coefficients of such formula which we 
have spoken of as two separate steps are in practice 
almost necessarily simultaneous for the neaft coinci 
dence of the results o£ the theoretical rule with the 
observed facts confirms at the same time the formula 
and its coefficients in this case also the mode of 
arriving at truth is to try various hypotheses — to 
modify the hypotheses so as to approximate to the 
facts and to multiply the facts so as to test the hy 
potheses 

the independent variable and the formula which 
we would try being once selected mathematicians have 
devised certain special and technical processes by which 
the value of the coefficients may be determined these 
we shall treat of in the next chapter but in the mean 
time we may noty in a more general manner the mode 
in which in physical researches the proper formula 
may be obtained 

 a person somewhat versed in mathematics hav 
ing before him a series of numbers will generally be 
able to devise a formula which approaches near to 
those numbers if for instance the series is con 
stantly progressive he will be able to see whether it 
more nearly resembles an arithmetical or a geometrical 
progression for example mm dulong and petit in 
their investigation of the law of cooling of bodies 
obtained the following series of measures a thermo 
meter made hot was placed in an enclosure of which 
the temperature was degrees and the rapidity of 



construction of the conception ± 

cooling of the thermometer was noted for many tern 
peratures it was found that 
for the temperature the rapidity of cooling was ‘

and so on now this series of numbers manifestly in 
creases with greater rapidity as we proceed from the 
lower to the higher parts of the scale the numbers 
do not however form a geometrical series as we may 
easily ascertain but if we were to take the differences 
of the successive terms we should find them to be — 
i roi c 
and these numbers are very nearly the terms of a geo 
metric series for if we divide each term by the suc 
ceeding one we find these numbers

in which there does not appear to be any constant ten 
dency to diminish or increase and we shall find that 
a geometrical series in which the ratio is maybe 
made to approach very near to this series the devi 
ations from it being only such as may be accounted for 
by conceiving them as err ours of observation in this 
manner a certain formula is obtained giving results

which very nearly coincide with the observed facts as 
may be seen in the margin 

the physical law expressed by the formula just 
spoken of is this — that when a body is cooling in an 
empty inclosure which is kept at a constant tempera 
ture the quickness of the cooling for excesses of tem 
perature in arithmetical progression increases as the 
terms of a geometrical progression diminished by a 
constant number 

 in the actual investigation of dulong and petit 
however the formula was not obtained in precisely the 
manner just described for the quickness of cooling 
depends upon two elements the temperature of the hot 
body and the temperature of the inclosure not merely 
upon the excess of one of these over the other and 
it was found most convenient first to make such expe 
riments as should exhibit the dependence of the velo 
city of cooling upon the temperature of the enclosure 
which dependence is contained in the following law — 
the quickness of cooling of a thermometer in vacuo 
for a constant excess of temperature increases in geo 
metric progression when the temperature of the inclo 
sure increases in arithmetic progression from this 
law the preceding one follows by necessary conse 
quence 

this example may serve to show the nature of th 
artifices which may be used for the construction of 
formulae when we have a constantly progressive series 
of numbers to represent w e must not only endeavour 
by trial to contrive a formula which will answer the 
conditions but we must vary our experiments so as to 
determine first one factor or portion of the formula 
and then the other and we must use the most pro 


 for if be the temperature of 

the inclosure and t the excess of 

temperature of the hot body it ap 

pears by this law that thet radiation 

of heat is as ae and hence the quick 

ness of cooling which is as the excess 

of radiation is as a a that is 


as aeai which agrees with the 
formula given in the last note 

the whole of this series of re 
searches of dulong and petit is full of 
the most beautiful and instructive 
artifices for the construction of the 
proper formulae in physical research 



construction of the conception 

bable hypothesis as means of suggestion for our for 
mules 

 in a progressive series of numbers unless the 
formula which we adopt be really that which expresses 
the law of natkre the deviations of the formula from 
the facts will generally become enormous when the 
experiments are extended into new parts of the scale 
true formulae for a progressive series of results can 
hardly ever be obtained from a very limited range of 
experiments just as the attempt to guess the general 
course of a road or a river by knowing two or three 
points of it in the neighbourhood of one another would 
generally fail in the investigation respecting the 
laws of the cooling of bodies just noticed one great 
advantage of the course pursued by the experimenters 
was that their experiments included so great a range 
of temperatures the attempts to assign the law of 
elasticity of steam deduced from experiments made 
with moderate temperatures were found to be enor 
mously wrong when very high temperatures were 
made the subject of experiment it is easy to see that 
this must be so an arithmetical and a geometrical 
series may nearly coincide for a few terms moderately 
near each other but if we take remote corresponding 
terms in the two series one of these will be very many 
times the other and hence from a narrow range of 
experiments we may infer one of these series when we 
ought to infgr the other and thus obtain a law which 
is widely erroneous 

 in astronomy the serieses of observations which 
we have to study are for the most part not progressive 
but recurrent the numbers observed do not go on 
constantly increasing but after increasing up to a cer 
tain amount they diminish then after a certain space 
increase again and so on changing constantly through 
certain cycles in cases in which the observed numbers 
are of this kind the formula which expresses them 
must be a circular function of some sort or other in 
volving for instance sines tangeilts and other forms 
of ‘calculation which have recurring values when the 
angle on which they depend goes on constantly

increasing the main business of formal astronomy con 
sists in resolving the celestial phenomena into a series 
of terms of this land in detecting their arguments and 
in determining their coefficients 

j in constructing the formulae by which laws of 
nature are expressed although the first object is to 
assign the law of the phenomena philosophers have 
in almost all cases not proceeded in a purely empirical 
manner to connect the observed numbers by some ex 
pression of calculation but have been guided in the 
selection of their formula by some hypothesis respect 
ing the mode of connexion of the facts thus the for 
mula of dulong and petit above given was suggested 
by the theory of exchanges the first attempts at the 
resolution of the heavenly motions into circular func 
tions were clothed in the hypothesis of epicycles and 
this was almost inevitable i we must confess’ says 
copernicus ‘that the celestial motions are circular

an epicyclical combination to a simple ellipse the same

special methods of induction applicable to 
quantity 


aphorism xliii 

there are special methods of induction applicable to 
quantity of which the principal are the methbd of curves 
the method of means tty method of least squares and 
the method of residues 

aphorism xliv 

the method of curves consists in drawing a curve of 
which the observed quantities are the ordinates the quantity 
on which the change of these quantities depends being the 
abscissa the efficacy of this method depends upon the 
faculty which the eye possesses of readily detecting regu 
larity and irregularity in forms the method may be used 
to detect the laws which the observed quantities follow and 
also when the observations are inexact it may be used to cor 
rect these observations so as to obtain data more true than the 
observed facts themselves 

aphorism xlv 

the method of means gets rid of irregularities by taking 
the arithmetical mean of a great number of observed quanti 
ties its efficacy depends upon this that in cases in which 
observed quantities are affected by other inequalities besides 
that of which we wish to determine the law the excesses above 
and defects below thz quantities which the law in question 
would produce will in a collection of many observations 
balance each other 



special methods of induction 
aphorism xlyi 

tho method of least squares is a method of means in 
which the mean ts taken according to the condition that the 
sum of the squares of the errours of observation shall be the 
lecsst possible which the law of the facts allows it appears 
by the doctrine of chances that this is the most probable 
jnean 


aphorism xlyii 

the method of residues consists in subtracting from 
the quantities given by observation the quantity given by any 
law already discovered and then examining the remainder 
or residue order to discover the leading law which it 
follows when this second law has been discovered the 
quantity given by it may be subtracted from the first residue 
thus giving a second residue which may be examined in 
the same manner and so on the efficacy of this method 
depends principally upon the circumstance of the laws of 
variation being successively smaller and smaller in amount 
or at least in their mean effect so that the ulterior undis 
covered laws do not prevent the law in question from being 
prominent in the observations 

aphorism xlyiil 

the method of means and the method of least squares 
cannot be applied without our knowing vhe arguments of 
the inequalities which we seek the method of curves and 
the method of residues when the arguments of the principal 
inequalities are known often make it easy to find the others 

i n cases where the phenomena admit of numerical 
measurement and expression certain mathemati 
cal methods may be employed to facilitate and give 
accuracy to the determination of the formula by which 
the observations are connected into laws among the 
mo usual and important of these methods are the 
following —

sect i — the method of curves 

 the method of curves proceeds upon this basis 
that when one quantity undergoes a series of changes 
depending on the progress of another quantity as for 
instance the deviation of the moon from her equable 
place depends upon the progress of time this depend 
ence may be expressed by means of a curve in the 
language of mathematicians the variable quantity 
whose changes we would consider is made the ordi 
nate of the curve and the quantity on which the 
changes depend is made the abscissa in this manner 
the curve will exhibit in its form a series oft undula 
tions rising and falling so as to correspond with the 
alternate increase and diminution of the quantity re 
presented at intervals of space which correspond to 
the intervals of time or other quantity by which the 
changes are regulated thus to take another example 
if we set up at equal intervals a series of ordinates re 
presenting the height of all the successive high waters 
brought by the tides at a given place for a year the 
curve which connects the summits of all these ordi 
nates will exhibit a series of undulations ascending 
and descending once in about each fortnight since in 
that interval we have in succession the high spring 
tides and the low neap tides the curve thus drawn 
offers to the eye a picture of the order and magnitude 
of the changes to which the quantity under contem 
plation the height of high water is subject 

 how the peculiar facility and efficacy of the 
method of curves depends upon this circumstance — 
that order and regularity are more readily and clearly 
recognized when thus exhibited to the eye in a picture 
than they are wheh presented to the mind in any other 
manner to detect the relations of humber consi 
dered directly as humber is not easy and we might 



special methods op induction 


contemplate for a long time a table of recorded num 
bers withcjat perceiving the oraer of their increase and 
diminution even if the law were moderately simple 
as any one may satisfy himself by looking at a tide 
table but if these numbers are expressed by the 
magnitude of lines and if these lines are arranged in 
regular order the eye readily discovers the rule of 
their changes it follows the curve which runs along 
their extremities and takes note of the order in which 
its convexities and concavities succeed each other if 
any order be readily discoverable the separate ob 
servations are in this manner compared and generalized 
and reduced to rule by the eye aloye and the eye 
so employed detects relations of order jmd succession 
with a peculiar celerity and evidence if for example 
we thus arrange as ordinates tl prices of com in each 
year for a series of years we shall see the order rapi 
dity an amount of the increase and decrease of price 
far more clearly than in any other manner and if 
there were any recurrence of increase and decrease at 
stated intervals of years we should in this manner 
perceive it the eye constantly active and busy and 
employed in making into shapes the hints and traces 
of form which it contemplates runs along the curve 
thus offered to it and as it travels backwards and 
forwards is ever on the watch to detect some resem 
blance or contrast between one part and another and 
these resemblances and contrasts whep discovered are 
the images of laws of phenomena which are made 
manifest at once by this artifice although the mind 
could not easily catch the indications of their exist 
ence if they were not thus reflected to her in the clear 
mirror of space 

thus when we have a series of good observations 
and know the argument upon which their change of 
magnitude depends the method of curves enables us to 
ascertain almost at a glance the law of the change and 
by further attention may be made tg give us a formula 
witji great accuracy the method enables us to perceive 
among our observations an order which without the 
method is concealed in obscurity and perplexity 



 formation of science 

 but the method of curves not only enables us 
to obtain laws of nature from good observations but 
also in a great degree from observations which are 
very imperfect for the imperfection of observations 
may in part be corrected by this consideration — that 
though they may appear irregular the correct facts 
which they imperfectly represent are really regular 
and the method of curves enables us to remedy this 
apparent irregularity at least in part for when ob 
servations thus imperfect are laid down as ordinates 
and their extremities connected by a line we obtain 
not a smooth and flowing curve such as we should 
have if the observations contained only the rigorous 
results of regular laws but a broken and irregular 
line full of sudden and capricious twistings and bear 
ing on its face marks pf irregularities dependent not 
upon law but upon chance yet these irregular and 
abrupt deviations in the curve are in most cases but 
small in extent when compared with those bendings 
which denote the effects of regular law and this 
circumstance is one of the great grounds of advantage 
in the method of curves for when the observations 
thus laid down present to the eye such a broken and 
irregular line we can still see often with great ease 
and certainty what twistings of the line are probably 
due to the irregular errours of observation andean 
at once reject these by drawing a more regular curve 
cutting off all such small and irregular sinuosities 
leaving some to the right and some to the left and 
then proceeding as if this regular curve and not the 
irregular one expressed the observations in this 
manner we suppose the errours of observation to 
balance each other some of our corrected measures 
being too great and others too small but with no great 
preponderance either way we draw our main regular 
curve not through the points given by our observa 
tions but among them drawing it as has been said 
by one of the philosophers who first systematically 
used this method ‘ with a bold but careful hand’ 


 sir j herschel ast soc trans vol v p u 



special methods of induction 


the regular curve which we thus obtain thus freed 
from the casual errours of observation is that in which 
we endeaur to discover the laws of change and suc 
cession 

 by this method thus getting rid at once in a 
great measure of errours of observation we obtain 
data which are more true than the individual facts 
themselves the philosopher’s business is to compare 
his hypotheses with facts as we have often said but 
if we make the comparison with separate special facts 
we are liable to be perplexed or misled to an unknown 
amount by the errours of observation which may 
cause the hypothetical and the observed result to agree 
or to disagree when otherwise they wold not do so 
if however we thus take the whole mass of the facts 
and remove the errours of actual observation by 
making the curve which expresses the supposed obser 
vation regular and smooth we have the separate facts 
corrected by their general tendency we are put in 
possession as we have said of something more true 
than any fact by itself is 

one of the most admirable examples of the use of 
this method of curves is found in sir j ohn herschel’s 
investigation of the orbits of double stars the author 
there shows how far inferior the direct observations of 
tb angle of position are to the observations corrected 
by a curve in the manner above stated ‘ this curve 
once drawn he says must represent it is evident 
the law of variation of the angle of position with the 
time not only for instants intermediate between the 
dates of observations but even at the moments of 
observation themselves much better than the indivi 
dual raw observations can possibly on an average do 
it is only requisite to try a case or two to be satisfied 
that by substituting the curve for the points we have 
made a nearer approach to nature and in a great 
measure eliminated errours of observation’ ‘ fol 
lowing the graphical process he adds ‘we have a 
conviction almost approaching to moral certainty that 



 formation of science 

we cannot be greatly misled’ again having thus 
corrected the raw observations he makes nother use 
of the graphical method by trying whether an ellipse 
can be drawn ‘ if not through at last among the 
points so as to approach tolerably near them all and 
thus approaching to the orbit which is the subject of 
investigation’ 

 the obstacles which principally impede the ap 
plication of the method of curves are i our ignorance 
of the argument of the changes and ii the complica 
tion of several laws with one another 

i if we do not know on what quantity those 
changes depend which we are studying we may fail 
entirely in defecting the law of the changes although 
we throw the observations into curves for the true 
argument of the chaqge should in fact be made the 
abscissa of the curve if we were to express by a 
series of ordinates the hour of high water eta succes 
sive days we should not obtain or should obtam very 
imperfectly the law which these times folloipsror the 
real argument of this change is not the solar hour but 
the hour at which the moon passes the meridian but 
if we are supposed to be aware that this is the argu 
ment which theory suggests and trial instantly con 
firms we then do immediately obtain the primary 
buies of the time of high water by throwing a series 
of observations into a curve with the hour of the 
moon’s transit for the abscissa 

in like manner when we have obtained the first 
great or semimensual inequality of the tides if we 
endeavour to discover the laws of other inequalities by 
means of curves we must take from theory the sug 
gestion that the arguments of such inequalities will 
probably be the parallax and the declination of the 
moon this suggestion again is confirmed by trial 
but if we were supposed to be entirely ignorant of the 
dependence of the changes of the tide on the distance 
and declination of the moon the curves would exhibit 
unintelligible and seemingly capricious changes t for 
by the effect of the inequality arising from tjie paral 
lax the convexities of the curves which belong to ’the 



special methods of induction q 

• 

spring tides are in some years made alternately greater 
and less all the year through while in other years 
they are aade all nfearly equal this difference does 
not betray its origin till we refer it to the parallax 
and the same difficulty in proceeding would arise if we 
were ignorant that the moon’s declination is one of the 
arguments of tidal changes 

in like manner if we try to reduce to law any me 
teorological changes those of the height of the baro 
meter for instance we find that we can make little 
progress in the investigation precisely because we do 
not know the argument on which these changes de 
pend that there is a certain regular diurnal change 
of small amount we know but when e have abstracted 
this inequality of which the argument is the time of 
day we find far greater changes left behind from day 
to day and from hour to hour and we express these 
in curves but we cannot reduce them to buie because 
we cannot discover on what numerical quantity they 
depend assiduous study of barometrical observa 

tions throws into curves may perhaps hereafter point 
out to us what are the relations of time and space by 
which these variations are determined but in the 
mean time this subject exemplifies to us our remark 
that the method of curves is of comparatively small 
use so long as we are in ignorance of the real argu 
ments of the inequalities 

 ii in the next place i remark that a diffi 

culty is thrown in the way of the metlfbd of curves by 
the combinatioi of several laws one with another it 
will readily be seen that such a cause will produce a 
complexity in the curves which exhibit the succession 
of facts if for example we take the case of the tides 
the height of high water increases and diminishes with 
the approach of the sun to and its becess from the 
syzygies of the moon again this height increases 
and diminishes as the moon’s parallax increases and 
diminishes and again the height diminishes when 
the declination increases and vice virsa and all these 
arguments of change the distance from syzygy the 
parallax the declination complete their circuit and 
nov org 



 


formation of science 


return into themselves in different periods hence 
the curve which represents the height of high water 
has not any periodical interval in which it completes 
its changes and commences a new cycle the sinuosity 
which would arise from each inequality separately 
considered interferes with disguises and conceals the 
others and when we first cast our eyes on the curve 
of observation it is very far from offering any obvious f 
regularity in its form and it is to be observed that 
we have not yet enumerated all the elements of this 
complexity for there are changes of the tide depend 
ing upon the parallax and declination of the sun as 
well as of the moon again besides these changes of 
which the arguments are obvious there are others as 
those depending upon the barometer and the wind 
which follow no known regular law and which con 
stantly affect and disturb the results produced by other 
laws 

in the tides and in like manner in the motions of 
the moon we have very eminent examples of the way 
in which the discovery of laws may be rendered diffi 
cult by the number of laws which operate to affect the 
same quantity in such cases the inequalities are 
generally picked out in succession nearly in the order 
of their magnitudes in this way there were succes 
sively collected from the study of the moon’s motions 
by a series of astronomers those inequalities which we 
term the equation of the center the erection the 
variation and the annual equation these inequa 
lities were not in fact obtained by the application of 
the method of curves but the method of curves 
might have been applied to such a case with great ad 
vantage the method lias been applied with great 
industry and with remarkable success to the investiga 
tion of the laws of the tides and by the use of it 
a series of inequalities both of the times and of the 
heights of high water has been detected which explain 
all the main features of the observed facts 



special methods of induction 


ject ii — the method of means 

 the method of curves as we have endeavoured 
to explain above frees us from the casual and extra 
neous irregularities which arise from the imperfection 
of observation and thus lays bare the results of the 

 laws which really operate and enables us to proceed in 
search of those laws but the method of curves is 
not the only one which effects such a purpose the 
errours arising from detached observations may be got 
rid of and the additional accuracy which multiplied 
observations give may be obtained by operations upon 
the observed numbers without expressing them by 
spaces the process of curves assumes tftat the errours 
of observation balance each other — that the accidental 
excesses and defects are nearly £qual in amount — that 
the true quantities which would have been observed 
if all accidental causes of irregularity were removed 
are obtained exactly or nearly by selecting quantities 
upon the whole equally distant from the extremes of 
great and small which our imperfect observations offer 
to us but when among a number of unequal quan 
tities we take a quantity equally distant from the 
greater and the smaller this quantity is termed the 
mean of the unequal quantities hence the correction 
of odr observations by the method of curves consists in 
taking the mean of the observations 

 now without employing curves we may proceed 
arithmetically to take the mean of all the observed 
numbers of each class’ thus if we wished to know 
the height of the spring tide at a given place and if 
we found that four different spring tides were mea 
sured as being of the height of ten thirteen eleven 
and fourteen feet we should conclude that the true 
height of the tide was the mean of these numbers — 
namely twelve feet and we should suppose that the 
deviation from this height in the individual cases 
arose from the accidents of weather the imperfections 
of observation or the operation of other laws besides 
tb alternation of spring and neap tides 


— 



 


formation of science 


this process of finding the mean of an assemblage of 
observed numbers is much practised in discovering 
and still more in confirming and correcting laws of 
phenomena we shall notice a few of its peculiarities 

 the method of means requires a knowledge of 
the argument of the changes which we would study 
for the numbers must be arranged in certain classes 
before we find the mean of each class and the prin 
ciple on which this arrangement depends is the argu 
ment this knowledge of the argument is more in 
dispensably necessary in the method of means than in 
the method of curves for when curves are drawn the 
eye often spontaneously detects the law of recurrence in 
their sinuositjes but when we have collections of 
numbers we must divide them into classes by a selec 
tion of our own tims in order to discover the law 
which the heights of the tide follow in the progress 
from spring to neap we arrange the observed tides 
according to the day of the moons age and we then 
take the mean of all those which thus happen at the 
same period of the moon’s revolution in this manner 
we obtain the law which we seek and the process is 
very nearly the same in all other applications of this 
method of means in all cases we begin by assuming 
the classes of measures which we wish to compare the 
law which we could confirm or correct the formula 
of which we would determine the coefficients 

 the argument being thus assumed the method 
of meanft is very efficacious in ridding our inquiry of 
errours and irregularities which would impede and per 
plex it irregularities which are altogether accidental 
or at least accidental with reference to some law which 
we have under consideration compensate each other in 
a very remarkable way when we take the means of 
many observations if we have before us a collection 
of observed tides some of them may be elevated some 
depressed by the wind some noted too high and some 
too low by the observer some augmented and some 
diminished by uncontemplated changes in the moon’s 
distance or motion but in the course of a year or wo 
at the longest all these causes of irregularity balance 



special methods of induction 


each other and the law of succession which runs 
through tjie observations comes out as precisely as if 
those disturbing influences did not exist in any par 
ticular case thore appears to be no possible reason why 
the deviation should be in one way or of one moderate 
amount rather than another but taking the mass of 
observations together the deviations in opposite ways 
will be of equal amount with a degree of exactness 
very striking this is found to be the case in all in 
quiries where we have to deal with observed numbers 
upon a large scale in the progress of the population 
of a country for instance what can appear more incon 
stant in detail than the causes which produce births 
and deaths yet in each country and even in each 
province of a country the proportions of the whole 
numbers of births and deaths remain nearly constant 
what can be more seemingly beyond the reach of rule 
than the occasions which produce letters that cannot 
and their destination yet it appears that the number 
of ‘ dead letters’ is nearly the same from year to year 
and the same is the result when the deviations arise 
not from mere accident but from laws perfectly regu 
lar though not contemplated in our investigation 
thus the effects of the moon’s parallax upon the tides 
sometimes operating one way and sometimes another 
according to certain rules are quite eliminated by 
taking the means of a long scries of observations the 
excesses and defects neutralizing cacli mother o far as 
concerns the effect upon any law of the tides which we 
would investigate 

ii in order to obtain very great accuracy very 
large masses of observations are often employed by 
philosophers and the accuracy of the result increases 
with the multitude of observations the immense col 
lections of astronomical observations which have in 
this manner been employed in order to form and cor 
rect the tables of the celestial motions are perhaps 
the most signal instances of the attempts to obtain 

 provided the argument of the law dcnce wifh the argument of the law 
which we neglect have no coinci which we would determine 



 formation of science 

accuracy by this accumulation of observations delam 
bre’s tables of the sun are founded upon nearly 
observations burg’s tables of the moon upon above 
 

but there are other instances hardly less remark 
able mr lubbock’s first investigations of the laws of 
the tides of london included above observa 
tions extending through nineteen years it being con 
sidered that this large number was necessary to remove 
the effects of accidental causes and the attempts 
to discover the laws of change in the barometer have 
led to the performance of labours of equal amount 
laplace and bouvard examined this question by means 
of observation made at the observatory of paris four 
times every day for eight years 

 we may remark one striking evidence of the 
accuracy thus obtained by employing large masses of 
observations in this way we may often detect inequa 
lities much smaller than the errours by which they are 
encumbered and concealed thus the diurnal oscilla 
tions of the barometer were discovered by the com 
parison of observations of many days classified accord 
ing to the hours of the day and the result was a clear 
and incontestable proof of the existence of such oscilla 
tions although the differences which these oscillations 
produce at different hours of the day are far smaller 
than the casual changes hitherto reduced to no law 
which gg on from hour to hour and from day to day 
the effect of law operating incessantly and steadily 
makes itself more and more felt as we give it a longer 
range while the effect of accident followed out in the

 this period of nineteen years 
was also selected for a reason which 
is alluded to in a former note it 
was thought that this period se 
cured the inquirer from ‘the errours

same manner is to annihilate itself and to disappear 
altogether from the result 


sect hi — the method of least squares 

 the method of least squares is in fact a 
method of means but with some peculiar characters 
its object is to determine the best mean of a number 
of observed quantities or the most probable law 
derived from a number of observations of which some 
or all are allowed to be more or less imperfect and 
the method proceeds upon this supposition — that all 
errours are not equally probable but that small 
errours are more probable than latge ones by rea 
soning mathematically upon this ground we find that 
the best result is obtained since we cannot obtain a 
result in which the errours vaftish by making not the 
errours themselves but the sum of their squares of 
the smallest possible amount 

 an example may illustrate this let a quan 
tity which is known to increase uniformly as the dis 
tance of a star from the meridian at successive in 
stants be measured at equal intervals of time and be 
found to be successively it is plain upon 
the face of these observations that they are erroneous 
for they ought to form an arithmetical progression but 
fh£y deviate widely from such a progression but the 
question then occurs what arithmetical progression do 
they most probably represent for • we m§ty assume 
several arithmetical progressions which more or less 
approach the observed series as for instance these 
three now in order 
to see the claims of each of these to the truth we may 
tabulate them thus

this method in more extensive and complex cases 
is a great aid to the calculator in his inferences from 
facts and removes much that is arbitrary in the method 
of means 

sect tv the method of residues 

t by either of the preceding methods we obtain 
from observed facts such laws as readily offer them 
selves and by the laws thus discovered the most pro 
minent changes of the observed quantities are accounted 
for but in many cases we have as we have noticed 
already several laws off nature operating at the same 
time and combining their influences to modify those 
quantities which are the subjects of observation in 
these cases we may by successive applications of the 
methods already pointed out detect such laws one 
after another but this successive process though only 
a repetition of what we have already described offers 
some peculiar features which make it convenient to 
consider it in a separate section as the method of 
residues 

 when we have in a series of changes of 
a variable quantity discovered one law which the 
changes follow detected its argument and determined 
its magnitude so as to explain most clearly the course 
of observed facts we may still find that the observed 
changes are not fully accounted for when we com 
pare the results of our law with the observations 
there may be a difference or as we may term it a 
residue still unexplained but this residue being 
thus detached from the rest may be examined and 
scrutinized in the same manner as the whole observed 
quantify was treated at first and we may in this way 
detect in it also a lhw of change if we can do this 
we must accommodate this new found law as rfearly 
as possible to the residue to which it belongs and 



special methods of induction 


this being done the difference of our buie and of the 
besidue itself forms a second residue this second 
besidue re may again bring under our consideration 
and may perhaps in it also discover some law of change 
by which its alterations may be in some measure ac 
counted for if this can be done so as to account for 
a large portion of this besidue the remaining unex 
plained part forms a third residue and so on 

 this course has really been followed in various 
inquiries especially in those of astronomy and tido 
logy the equation of the center for the moon was 
obtained out of the residue of the longitude which 
remained when the mean anomaly was taken away 
this equation being applied and disposed of the second 
residue thus obtained gave to ptolemy the erection 
the third residue left by the equation of the center 
and the evection supplied to tycho the variation 
and the annual equation and the besidue remain 
ing from these has been exhausted by other equations 
of various arguments suggested by theory on by obser 
vation in this case the successive generations of 
astronomers have gone on each in its turn executing 
some step in this method of residues in the exami 
nation of the tides on the other hand this method 
has been applied systematically and at once the 
observations readily gave the semimensual inequality 
the residue of this supplied the corrections due to the 
moon’s parallax and declination and when these 
were determined the remaining residue was explored 
for the law of the solar correction 

 in a certain degree the method of residues and 
the method of means are opposite to each other for 
the method of residues extricates laws from their 
combination bringing them into view in succession 
while the method of means discovers each law not by 
bringing the others into view but by destroying their 
effect through an accumulation of observations by 
the method of residues we should first ‘extract the 
law of the parallax correction of tlie tides and then 
from fhe besidue left by this obtain the declination 
correction but we might at once employ the method 



 


formation of science 


of means and put together all the cases in which the 
declination was the same not allowing for the paral 
lax in each case but taking for granted that the 
parallaxes belonging to the same declination would 
neutralize each other as many falling above as below 
the mean parallax in cases like this where the 
method of means is not impeded by a partial coinci 
dence of the arguments of different unknown inequa 
lities it may be employed with almost as much success 
as the method of residues but still when the argu 
ments of the laws are clearly known as in this in 
stance the method of residues is more clear and 
direct and is the rather to be recommended 

 if for example we wish to learn whether the 
height of the barometer exerts any sensible influence 
on the height of the sea’s surface it would appear 
that the most satisfactoiy mode of proceeding must be 
to subtract in the first place what we know to be the 
effects of the moon’s age parallax and declination 
and other ascertained causes of change and to search 
in the unexplained residue for the effects of barome 
trical pressure the contrary course has however 
been adopted and the effect of the barometer on the 
ocean has been investigated by the direct application 
of the method of means classing the observed heights 
of the water according to the corresponding heights of 
the barometer without any previous reduction in 
this manner the suspicion that the tide of the sea is 
affected by the pressure of the atmosphere has been 
confirmed this investigation must be looked upon 
as a remarkable instance of the efficacy of the method 
of means since the amount of the barometrical effect 
is much smaller than the other changes from among 
which it was by this process extricated but an appli 
cation of the method of residues would still be desi 
rable on a subject of such extent and difficulty 

 r sir john herschel in his discourse on the 
study of natural philosophy articles — has 
pointed out the mode of making discoveries by study 
ing residual phenomena and has given several illus 
trations of the process in some of these he has also

• sect i — the law of continuity 

i rtlhe law of continuity is applicable to quantity 
x primarily and therefore might be associated 
with the methods treated of in the last chapter but 
 inasmuch as its inferences are made by a transition from 
one degree to another among contiguous cases it will 
be found to belong more properly to the methods of 
induction of which we have now to speak 

the law of continuity consists in this proposition 
— that a quantity cannot pass from one amount to 
another by any change of conditions without passing 
through all intermediate degrees of magnitude accord 
ing to the intermediate conditions and this law may 
often be employed to correcf inaccurate inductions 
and to reject distinctions which have no real founda 
tion in nature for example the aristotelians made 
a distinction between motions according to nature as 
that of a body falling vertically downwards and mo 
tions contrary to nature as that of a body moving 
along a horizontal plane the former they held became 
naturally quicker and quicker the latter naturally 
slower and slower but to this it might be replied 
that a horizontal line may pass by gradual motion 
through various inclined positions to a vertical posi 
tion and thus the retarded motion may pass into the 
accelerated and hence there must be some inclined 
plane on which the motion downwards is naturally 
uniform which is false and therefore the distinction 
of such kinds of motion is unfounded again the 
proof of the first law of motion depends upon the 
law of continuity for since by diminishing the re 
sistance to a body moving n a horizontal plane we 
diminish the retardation and this without limit the 
law of continuity will bring us at the same time to 
the case of no resistance and to the case oflio re 
tardation 

the law of continuity is asserted by galileo 
in a particular application and the assertion which it 



 


formation of science 


suggests is by him referred to plato — namely that a 
moveable body cannot pass from rest to a determinate 
degree of velocity without passing through all smaller 
degrees of velocity this law however was first as 
serted in a more general and abstract form by leib 
nitz and was employed by him to show that the laws 
of motion propounded by descartes must be false the 
third cartesian law of motion was this that when 
one moving body meets another if the first body have 
a less momentum than the second it will be reflected 
with its whole motion but if the first have a greater 
momentum than the second it will lose a part of its 
motion which it will transfer to the second now 
each of these cases leads by the law of continuity to 
the case in which the two bodies have equal momen 
tums but in this case by the first part of the law the 
body would retain all its motion and by the second 
part of the law it would lose a portion of it hence the 
cartesian law is false 

 i shall take another example of the application 
of this law from professor playfair’s dissertation on 
the history of mathematical and physical science 
‘the academy of sciences at paris having in 
proposed as a prize question the investigation of the 
laws of the communication of motion john bernoulli 
presented an essay on the subject very ingenious and 
profound in which however he denied the existence 
of hard bodies because in the collision of such bodies 
a finite change of motion must take place in an instant 
an event which on the principle just explained he 
maintained to be impossible’ and this reasoning 
was justifiable for we can form a continuous transi 
tion from cases in which the impact manifestly occu 
pies a finite time as when we strike a large soft 
body to cases in which it is apparently instantaneous 
maclaurin and others are disposed in order to avoid 
the conclusion of bernoulli to reject the law of con

tinuity this however would not only be as playfair 
says to deprive ourselves of an auxiliary commonly 
useful thoiigh sometimes deceptive but what is much 
worse to acquiesce in false propositions from the want 
of clear and patient thinking for the law of con 
tinuity when rightly interpreted is never violated in 
actual fact there are not really any such bodies as 
liave been termed perfectly hard and if we approach 
towards such cases we must learn the laws of motion 
which rule them by attending to the law of con 
tinuity not by rejecting it 

 newton used the law of continuity to suggest 
but not to prove the doctrine of universal gravitation 
let he said a terrestrial body be carried as high as 
the moon will it not still fall to tlie derth and does 
not the moon fall by the same force again if any 
one says that iftere is a material ether which does not 
gravitate this kind of matter by condensation may 
be gradually transmuted to the density of the most 
intensely gravitating bodies and these gravitating 
bodies by taking the internal texture of the condensed 
ether may cease to gravitate and thus the weight of 
bodies depends not on their quantity of matter but 
on their texture which doctrine newton conceived he 
had disproved by experiment 

 the evidence of the law of continuity resides 
in t’ne universality of those ideas which enter into 
our apprehension of laws of nature when of two 
quantities one depends upon the other the law of 
continuity necessarily governs this dependence every 
philosopher lias the power of applying this law in pro 
portion as he has the faculty of apprehending the ideas 
which he employs in his induction with the same 
clearness and steadiness which belong to the funda 
mental ideas of quantity space and number to those 
who possess this faculty the law is a ttule of very wide 
and decisive application its use as has appeared in the 
above examples is seen rather in the disproof of eprone 
ous views and in the correction of lalse propositions

than in the invention of new truths it is a test of 
truth rather than an instrument of discovery 

methods however approaching very ner to the 
law of continuity may be employed as positive means 
of obtaining new truths and these i shall now de 
scribe 

sect ii — the method of gradation 

 to gather together the cases which resemble 
each other and to separate those which are essentially 
distinct has often been described as the main business 
of science and may in a certain loose and vague 
manner of speaking pass for a description of some of 
the leading procedures in the acquirement of know 
ledge the selection of instances which agree and of 
instances which differ in some prominent point or 
property are important steps in th formation of 
science but when classes of things and properties 
have been established in virtue of such comparisons it 
may still be doubtful whether these classes are sepa 
rated by distinctions of opposites or by differences of 
degree and to settle such questions the method of 
gradation is employed which consists in taking inter 
mediate stages of the properties in question so as to 
ascertain by experiment whether in the transition 
from one class to another we have to leap over a 
manifest gap or to follow a continuous road 

 thus for instance one of the early divisions 
established by electrical philosophers was that of elec 
tries and conductors but this division dr faraday 
has overturned as an essential opposition he takes a 
gradation which carries him from conductors to non 
conductors sulphur or lac he says are held to be 
nonconductors but are not rigorously so spermaceti 
is a bad conductor ice or water better than sperma 
ceti metals so much better that they are put in a 
different class but even in metals the transit of the 
electricity is not instantaneous we have in them proof 
of a retardation df the electric current ‘and what 


 researches th series art 




methods of induction 


 

reason” mr faraday asks w wliy this retardation 
should not be of the same kind as that in spermaceti 
or in lac at sulphur but as in them retardation is 
insulation and insulation is induction why should 
we refuse the same relation to the same exhibitions of 
force in the metals” 

the process employed by the same sagacious philo 
sopher to show the identity of voltaic and franklinic 
electricity is another example of the same kind ma 
chine franklinic electricity was made to exhibit the 
same phenomena as voltaic electricity by causing the 
discharge to pass through a bad conductor into a very 
extensive discharging train and thus it was clearly 
shown that franklinic electricity nbt so conducted 
differs from the other kinds only in being in a state 
of successive tion and explosion instead of a state 
of continued ctsrent 

again to show that the decomposition of bodies in 
the voltaic circuit was not due to the attraction of the 
poles mr faraday devised a beautiful series of expe 
riments in which these supposed poles were made to 
assume all possible electrical conditions — in some cases 
the decomposition took place against air which accord 
ing to common language is not a conductor nor is de 
composed — in others against the metallic poles which 
are excellent conductors but un decomposable — and so 
on and hence he infers that the decomposition cannot 
justly be considered as due to the attraction or at 
tractive powers of the poles 

 the reader of the novum organon may perhaps 
in looking at such examples of the buie be reminded 
of some of bacon’s classes of instances as his in 
stantice absentice in •proximo and his instantice mi 
grantes but we may remark that instances classed 
and treated as bacon recommends in those parts of 
his work could hardly lead to scientific truth his 


 these words refer to another proposition also established by the method

processes are vitiated by his proposing to himself the 
form or cause of the property before him as the object 
of his inquiry instead of being content towobtain in 
the first place the f law of phenomena thus his ex 
ample of a migrating instance is thus given “ let 
the nature inquired into be that of whiteness an in 
stance migrating to the production of this property is 
glass first whole and then pulverized or plain water 
and water agitated into a foam for glass and water 
are transparent and not white but glass powder and 
foam are white and not transparent hence we must 
inquire what has happened to the glass or water in 
that migration for it is plain that the form of 
whiteness is conveyed and induced by the crushing 
of the glass and shaking of the water” no real 
knowledge has resulted from this line“ reasoning — 
from taking the natures and forms w things and of 
their qualities for the primaiy subject of our re 
searches 

 we may easily give examples from other sub 
jects in which the method of gradation has been used 
to establish or to endeavour to establish very exten 
sive propositions thus laplace’s nebular hypothe 
sis — that systems like our solar system are formed by 
gradual condensation from diffused masses such as the 
nebulae among the stars — is founded by him upon an 
application of this method of gradation we see he 
conceives among these nebulae instances of all degrees 
of condensation from the most loosely diffused fluid 
to that separation and solidification of parts by which 
suns and satellites and planets are formed and thus 
we have before us instances of systems in all their 
stages as in a forest we see trees in every period of 
growth how far the examples in this case satisfy the 
demands of the method of gradation it remains for 
astronomers and philosophers to examine 

again this method was used with great success by 
mactulloch and others to refute the opinion put in 
currency by the w ernerian school of geologists that 


 nov org lib ii aph 


methods of induction 


 


the rocks called trap rocks must be classed with those 
to which a sedimentary origin is ascribed for it was 
shown that a gradual transition might be traced from 
those examples in which trap rocks most resembled 
stratified rocks to the lavas which have been recently 
ejected from volcanoes and that it was impossible to 
assign a different origin to one portion and to the 
•other of this kind of mineral masses and as the 
volcanic rocks were certainly not sedimentary it fol 
lowed that the trap rocks were not of that nature 

again we have an attempt of a still larger kind 
made by sir c lyell to apply this method of gradation 
so as to disprove all distinction between the causes by 
which geological phenomena have befen produced and 
the causes which are now acting at the earth’s surface 
he has collected a very remarkable series of changes 
which have fallen place and are still taking place by 
the action of water volcanoes earthquakes and other 
terrestrial operations and he conceives he has shown 
in these a gradation which leads with no wide chasm 
or violent leap to the state of things of which geologi 
cal researches have supplied the evidence 

 o of the value of this method in geological specu 
lations no doubt can be entertained yet it must still 
require a grave and profound consideration in so vast 
ai application of the method as that attempted by 
sir lyell to determine what extent we may allow to 
the steps of our gradation and to decide how far the 
changes which have taken place in distant parts of the 
series may exceed those of which we have historical 
knowledge without ceasing to be of the same kind 
those who dwelling in a city see from time to time 
one house built and another pulled down may say that 
such existing causes operating through past time suffi 
ciently explain the existing condition of the city yet 
we arrive at important political and historical truths 
by considering the origin of a city as an event of a dif 
ferent order from those daily changes ’the causes 
which are now working to produce geological results 
may be supposed to have been at some former epoch 
so tar exaggerated in their operation that the changes 

 — 



 


formation of science 


should be paroxysms not degrees — that they should 
violate not continue the gradual series and we 
have no kind of evidence whether the duration of our 
historical times is sufficient to give usj a just measure 
of the limits of such degrees — whether the terms 
which we have under our notice enable us to ascertain 
the average rate of progression 

 the result of such considerations seems to be 
this — that we may apply the method of gradation in 
the investigation of geological causes provided we 
leave the limits of the gradation undefined but 
then this is equivalent to the admission of the opposite 
hypothesis for a continuity of which the successive 
intervals are not limited is not distinguishable from 
discontinuity the geological sects of recent times 
have been distinguished as uniformitcyrians and cata 
strophists the methodbf gradation seems to prove the 
doctrine of the uniformitarians but then at the same 
time that it does this it breaks down the distinction 
between them and the catastrophists 

there are other exemplifications of the use of grada 
tions in science which well deserve notice but some 
of them are of a kind somewhat different and may be 
considered under a separate head 

sect iii the method of natural classification 

 the method of natural classification consists as 
we have seen in grouping together objects not accord 
ing to any selected properties but according to their 
most important resemblances and in combining such 
grouping with the assignation of certain marks of the 
classes thus formed the examples of the successful 
application of this method are to be found in the 
classificatory sciences through their whole extent as 
for example in framing the genera of plants and ani 
mals the same method however may often be ex 
tended to other sciences thus the classification of 
crystalline forms according to their degree of sym 
metry which is really an important distinction as in 
troduced by mohs and weiss was a great improvement 



methods of induction 


 

upon haiiy’s arbitrary division according to certain 
assumed primary forms sir david brewster was led 
to the safhe distinction of crystals by the study of 
their optical properties and the scientific value of the 
classification was thus strongly exhibited mr how 
ard classification of clouds appears to be founded in 
their real nature since it enables him to express the 
daws of their changes a successions as we have 
elsewhere said the criterron of a true classification is 
that it makes general propositions possible one of 
the most prominent examples of the beneficial influ 
ence of a right classification is to be seen in the 
impulse given to geology by the distinction of strata 
according to the organic fossils which they contain 
which ever since its general adoption has been a lead 
ing principle in the speculation of geologists 

 the mode in which in this and in other cases 
the method of natural classification directs the re 
searches of the philosopher is this — his arrangement 
being adopted at least as an instrument of inquiry and 
trial he follows the course of the different members of 
the classification according to the guidance which na 
ture herself offers not prescribing beforehand the 
marks of each part but distributing the facts accord 
ing to the total resemblances or according to those 
resemblances which i finds to be most important 
thus in tracing the course of a series of strata from 
place to place we identify each stratum not by any 
single character but by all taken together — texture 
colour fossils position and any other circumstances 
which offer themselves and if by this means we 
come to ambiguous cases where different indications 
appear to point different ways we decide so as best to 
preserve undamaged those general relations and truths 
which constitute the value of our system thus 
although we consider the organic fossils in each stra 
tum as its most important characteristic we are not 
prevented by the disappearance of some fossils or the 
addition of others or by the total absence of fossils 


w hist ind sc b xviil c ii sect

from identifying trata in distant countries if the posi 
tion and other circumstances authorize us to do so 
and by this method of classification the cfoctrine of 
geological equivalents has been applied to a great 
part of europe 

 we may further observe that the same method 
of natural classification whidithus enables us to iden 
tify strata in remote situatmm notwithstanding thnif 
there may he great differences in their material and 
contents also forbids us to assume the identity of the 
series of rocks which occur in different countries when 
this identity has not been verified by such a continu 
ous exploration f the component members of the 
series it wuld be in the highest degree unphiloso 
phical to apply the special names of the english or 
german strata to the jocks of india or america or 
even of southern europe till it lias appeared that in 
those countries the geological series of northern europe 
really exists in each separate country the divisions 
of the formations which compose the crust of the 
earth must be made out by applying the method of 
natural arrangement to that particular case and not 
by arbitrarily extending to it the nomenclature belong 
ing to another case it is only by such precautions 
that we can ever succeed in obtaining geological propo 
sitions at the same time true and comprehensive or 
can obtain any sound general views respecting the 
physical history of the earth 

 the method of natural classification which 
we thus recommend falls in with those mental habits 
which we formerly described as resulting from the 
study of natural history the method as then termed 
the method of type and was put in opposition to the 
method of definition 

the method of natural classification is directly 
opposed to the process in which we assume and apply 
arbitrary definitions for in the former method we 
find our classes in nature and do not make them by 
marks of our own imposition nor can any advantage

to the progress of knowledge be procured by laying 
down our characters when our arrangements are as yet 
quite loosl and unformed nothing was gained by 
the attempts tq define metals by their weight their 
hardness their ductility their colour for to all these 
marks as fast as they were proposed exceptions were 
found among bodies which still could not be ex 
cluded from the list of metals it was only when 
elementary substances were divided into natural 
classes of which classes metals were one that a true 
view of their distinctive characters was obtained defi 
nitions in the outset of our examination of nature are 
almost always not only useless but prejudicial 

 when we obtain a law of nature by induction 
from phenomena it commonly happens as we have 
already soon that we introduce at the same time a 
proposition and a definition in this case the two 
are correlative each giving a real value to the other 
in such caseg also the definition as well as the pro 
position may become the basis of rigorous reasoning 
and may lead to a series of deductive truths we have 
examples of such definitions and propositions in the 
laws of motion and in many other cases 

 when we have established natural classes of 
objects we seek for characters of our classes and 
these characters may to a certain extent be called the 
definitions of our classes this is to be understood 
however only in a limited sense for these definitions 
are not absolute and permanent tfiey are liable to 
be modified and superseded if we find a case which 
manifestly belongs to our natural class though vio 
lating our definition we do not shut out the case but 
alter our definition thus when we have made it 
part of our definition of the rose family that they 
have alternate stipulate leaves we do not therefore 
exclude from the family the genus lowcea which has 
no stipulce in natural classifications our defini 
tions are to be considered as temporary and provi 
sional only when sir c lyell established the distinc 
tions of the tertiary strata which he termed eocene 
miocene and pliocene he took s numerical criterion 



 formation of science 

the proportion of recent species of shells contained in 
those strata as the basis of his division but now 
that those kinds of strata have become by their appli 
cation to a great variety of cases a series of natural 
classes we must in our researches keep in view the 
natural connexion of the formations themselves in dif 
ferent places and must by no means allow ourselves 
to be governed by the numerical proportions which 
were originally contemplated or even by any amended 
numerical criterion equally arbitrary for however 
amended definitions in natural history are never im 
mortal the etymologies of pliocene and miocene 
may hereafter come to have merely an historical inte 
rest and such a state of things will be no more incon 
venient provided the natural connexions of each class 
are retained than it is to call a rock oolite or por 
phyry when it has no roelike structure and no fiery 
spots 

the methods of induction which are treated of in 
this and the preceding chapter and which are specially 
applicable to causes governed by relations of quantity 
or of resemblance commonly lead us to laws of phe 
nomena only inductions founded upon other ideas 
those of substance and cause for example appear to 
conduct us somewhat further into a knowledge of the 
essential nature and real connexions of things bnt 
before we speak of these we shall say a few words 
respecting the way in which inductive propositions 
once obtained may be verified and carried into effect 
by their application

of the application of inductive truths

when the theory of any subject is established the obser 
vations and experiments which are made in applying the 
science to use and to instruction supply a perpetual verifi

accurate supply also corrections of the constants involved 
in the theory and sometimes by the method of residues

recently several new arts have been invented which may 
be regarded as notable verifications of the anticipations of 
material benefits to be derived to man from the progress of 
science 

i ty the application of inductive truths we here 

jd mean according to the arrangement given in 
chap i of this book those steps which in the natural 
order of science follow the discovery of each truth 
these steps are the verification of the discovery by ad 
ditional experiments and reasonings and its extension 
to new cases not contemplated by the original dis 
coverer these processes occupy that period which 
in the history of each great discovery we have termed 
the sequel of the epoch as the collection of facts and 
the elucidation of conceptions form its prelude 

 it is not necessary to dweli at length on the 
processes of the verification of discoveries when the 
law of nature is once stated it is far easier to devise 
and execute experiments which prove it than it was 
to discern the evidence before the truth becomes 
one of the standard doctrines of the science to which it 
belongs and is verified by all who study or who teach 
the science experimentally the leading doctrines of 
chemistry are constantly exemplified by each chemist 
in his laboratory and an amount of verification is 
thus obtained of which books give no adequate concep 
tion in astronomy we have a still stronger example 
of the process of verifying discoveries ever since the 
science assumed a systematic form there have been 
observatories in which the consequences of the theory 
were habitually compared with the results of observa 
tion and to facilitate this comparison tables of 
great extent have been calculated with immense la 
bour from each theoiy showing the place which the 



application inductive truths 

theory assigned to the heavenly bodies at successive 
times and thus as it were challenging nature to 
deny the •truth of the discovery in this way as i 
have elsewhere stated the continued prevalence of an 
eitour in the systematic parts of astronomy is impos 
sible an errour if it arise makes its way into the 
tables into the ephemeris into the observer’s nightly 
list or his sheet of reductions the evidence of sense 
flies in its face in a thousand observatories the dis 
crepancy is traced to its source and soon disappears 
for ever 

 in these last expressions we suppose the theory 
not only to be tested but also to be corrected when it 
is found to be imperfect and this also is part of the 
business of the observing astronomer from his accu 
mulated observations he deduces more exact values than 
had previously been obtained of the constants or co 
efficients of these inequalities of which the argument is 
already known this he is enabled to do by the methods 
explained in the fifth chapter of this book the method 
of means and especially the method of least squares 
in other cases he finds by the method of residues 
some new inequality for if no change of the coeffi 
cients will bring the tables and the observation to a 
coincidence he knows that a new term is wanting in 
bis formula he obtains as far as he can the law of 
this unknown term and when its existence and its 
law have been fully established there remains the 
task of tracing it to its cause 

 the condition of the science of astronomy with 
regard to its security and prospect of progress is one of 
singular felicity it is a question well worth our con 
sideration as regarding the interests of science whe 
ther in other branches of knowledge also a continued 
and connected system of observation and calculation 
imitating the system employed by astronomers might 
not be adopted wt the discussion of this question 
would involve us in a digression too wide for the pre 
sent occasion

 there is another mode of application of true 
theories after their discovery of which we must also 
speak i mean the process of showing that facts not 
included in the original induction and apparently of a 
different kind are explained by reasonings founded 
upon the theory — extensions of the theory as we may 
call them the history of physical astronomy is full 
of such events thus after bradley and wargentin 
had observed a certain cycle among the perturbations 
of j upiter’s satellites laplace explained this cycle by 
the doctrine of universal gravitation the long ine 
quality of jupiter and saturn the diminution of the 
obliquity of the ecliptic the acceleration of the moon’s 
mean motion were in like manner accounted for by 
laplace the coincidence of the nodes of the moon’s 
equator with those of her orbit was proved to result 
from mechanical principles by lagrange the motions 
of the recentlydiscovered planets and of comets shown 
by various mathematicians to be in exact accordance 
with the theory are y erificatjpns and extensions still 
more obvious 

 in many of the cases just noticed the consistency 
between the theory and the consequences thus proved 
to result from it is so far from being evident that the 
most consummate command of all the powers and aids 
of mathematical reasoning is needed to enable the phi 
losopher to arrive at the result in consequence of 
this circumstance the labours just referred to of la 
place lagrange and others have been the object of 
very great and very just admiration moreover the 
necessary connexion of new facts at first deemed inex 
plicable with principles already known to be true — 
a connexion utterly invisible at the outset and yet at 
last established with the certainty of demonstration — 
strikes us with the delight of a new discovery and at 
first sight appears no less admirable than an original 
induction accordingly men some ales appear tempted 
to consider laplace and other great mathematicians as 
persons of a kindred genius to newton we must not

application of inductive truths 

forget however that there is a great and essential dif 
ference between inductive and deductive processes of 
the mindt the discovery of a new theory which is 
true is a step widely distinct from any mere develop 
ment of the consequences of a theory already invented 
and established 

 in the other sciences also which have been 
framed by a study of natural phenomena we may find 
examples of the explanation of new phenomena by 
applying the principles of the science when once 
established thus when the laws of the reflection 
and refraction of light had been established a new 
and poignant exemplification of them was found in 
the explanation of the rainbow by llie reflection and 
refraction of light in the spherical drops of a shower 
and again another no less striking when the inter 
secting luminous circles and mock suns which are 
seen in cold seasons were completely explained by the 
hexagonal crystals of ice which float in the upper 
regions of the atmosphere the darkness of the space 
between the primary and secondary rainbow is another 
appearance which optical theory completely explains 
and when we further include in our optical theory 
the doctrine of interferences we find the explanation 
of other phenomena for instance the supernumerary 
ljainbows which accompany the primary rainbow on 
its inner side and the small halos which often sur 
round the sun and moon and when we come to 
optical experiments we find many instances in which 
the doctrine of interferences and of undulations have 
been applied to explain the phenomena by calculations 
almost as complex as those which we have mentioned 
in speaking of astronomy with results as little fore 
seen at first and as entirely satisfactory in the end 
such are scliwerdt’s explanation of the diffracted 
images of a triangular aperture by the doctrine of 
interferences and the explanation qf the coloured 
lemniscates seen by polarized light in biaxal crystals 
given by young and by hersche and still more 
marked is another case in which the curves are unsym 
mstrical namely the curves scenby passing polarized

liglit through plates of quartz which agree in a won 
derful manner with the calculations of air y to these 
we may add the curious phenomena and equally 
curious mathematical explanation of conical refrac 
tion as brought to view by professor lloyd and sir 
w hamilton indeed the whole history both of 
physical optics and of physical astronomy is a series 
of felicities of this kind as we have elsewhere observed 
such applications of theory and unforeseen explana 
tions of new facts by complicated trains of reasoning 
necessarily flowing from the theory are strong proofs 
of the truth of the theory while it is in the course of 
being established but we are here rather speaking of 
them as applications of the theory after it has been 
established 

those who thus apply principles already discovered 
arc not to be ranked in their intellectual achievements 
with those who discover new principles but still 
when such applications are masked by the complex 
relations of space and number it is impossible not to 
regard with admiration the clearness and activity of 
intellect which thus discerns in a remote region the 
rays of a central truth already unveiled by some great 
discoverer 

 as examples in other fields of the application 
of a scientific discovery to the explanation of natural 
phenomena we may take the identification of light 
ning with electricity by franklin and the explanation 
of dew ly wells for wells’s inquiry into the 
cause of dew though it has sometimes been praised 
as an original discovery was in fact only resolving 
the phenomenon into principles already discovered 
the atmologists of the last century were aware” that 
the vapour which exists in air in an invisible state 
maybe condensed into water by cold and they had 
noticed that there is always a certain temperature 
lower than that of the atmosphere to which if we 
depress bodies water forms upon them in fine drops 
this temperature is the limit of that which is neces 


 hist’ind sc b x c iii sect 



application of inductive truths 

sary to constitute vapour and is lienee called the con 
stituent temperature but these principles were not 
generally familiar in england till dr wells introduced 
them into his essay on dew published in having 
indeed been ill a great measure led to them by his 
own experiments and reasonings his explanation of 
dew — that it arises from the coldness of the bodies 
on which it settles — was established with great inge 
nuity and is a very elegant confirmation of the theory 
of constituent temperature 

 as other examples of such explanations of new 
phenomena by a theory we may point out ampere’s 
theory that magnetism is transverse voltaic currents 
applied to explain the rotation of a voltaic wire round 
a magnet and of a magnet round a voltaic wire and 
again in the same subject when it had been proved 
that electricity might be converted into magnetism it 
seemed certain that magnetism might be converted 
into electricity and accordingly faraday found under 
what conditions this may be done though indeed 
here the theory rather suggested the experiment than 
explained it when it had been independently observed 
the production of an electric spark by a magnet was 
a very striking exemplification of the theory of the 
identity of these different polar agencies 

 i chemistry such applications of the princi 
ples of the science are very fretjueut for it is the 
chemist’s business to account for the innumerable 
changes which take place in material substances by 
the effects of mixture licat and the like as a marked 
instance of such an application of the science we 
may take the explanation of the explosive force of 
gunpowder from the conversion of its materials 
into gases in mineralogy also we have to apply the 


the explanation is that the force times the hulk of the powder used 
is due to the sudden development hut from the intense heat developed 
of a large volume of nitrogen and at the moment of the explosion the 
carbonic acid gases which at the dilatatioif amounts to at least 
ordinary temperature of the air would times the volume of the gunpowder 
occupy a space equal to about employed 



 formation of science 

principles of chemistry to the analysis of bodies and 
i may mention as a case which at the time excited 
much notice the analysis of a mineral called heavy 
spar it was found that different specimens of this 
mineral differed in their crystalline angles about three 
degrees and a half a difference which was at variance 
with the mineralogical discovery then recently made 
of the constancy of the angle of the same substance 
yauquelin solved this difficulty by discovering that 
the crystals with the different angles were really 
minerals chemically different the one kind being sul 
phate of barytes and the other sulphate of strontian 

 in this way a scientific theory when once esta 
blished is perpetually finding new applications in the 
phenomena of nature and those who make such 
applications though as we have said they care not to 
be ranked with the gieat discoverers who establish 
theories new and true often receive a more prompt 
and general applause than great discoverers do be 
cause they have not to struggle with the perplexity 
and aversencss which often encounter the promulga 
tion of new truths 

 along with the verification and extension of 
scientific truths we are naturally led to consider the 
useful application of them the example of all the 
best writers who have previously treated of the philo 
sophy of sciences from bacon to herschcl draws our 
attention to those instances of the application of scien 
tific truths which are subservient to the uses of 
practical life to the support the safety the pleasure 
of man it is well known in how large a degree 
the furtherance of these objects constituted the merit 
of the novum organon in the eyes of its author 
and the enthusiasm with which men regard these 
visible and tangible manifestations of the power and 
advantage which knowledge may bring has gone on 
increasing up to our own day and undoubtedly such 
applications of the discoveries of science to promote 
the preservation comfort power and dignity of man 
must always be objects of great philosophical as wdl 
as practical interest yet we may observe that those 



application of inductive truths i 

practical inventions which are of most importance in 
the arts have not commonly in the past ages of the 
world been the results of theoretical knowledge nor 
have they tended very greatly to the promotion of such 
knowledge the use of bread and of wine has existed 
from the first beginning of man’s social history yet men 
have not had — wc may question whether they yet have 
 — a satisfactory theory of the constitution and fabrica 
tion of bread and of wine from a very early period 
there have been workers in metal yet who could tell 
upon what principles depended the purifying of gold 
and silver by the fire or the difference between iron 
and steel in some cases as in the story of the brass 
produced by the corinthian conflagration some parti 
cular step in art is ascribed to a special accident but 
hardly ever to tlio thoughtful activity of a scientific 
speculator the dyeing of cloths the fabrication and 
colouring of earthenware and glass vessels was carried 
to a very high degree of completeness yet who had 
any sound theoretical knowledge respecting these pro 
cesses are not all these arts still practised with 
a degree of skill which we can hardly or not at all 
surpass by nations which have properly speaking 
science i till lately at least if even now the case 
be different the operations by which map’s comforts 
luxuries and instruments were produced were either 
mcr£ practical processes which the artist practises but 
which the scientist cannot account for or as in astro 
nomy and optics they depended upon •a small portion 
only of the theoretical sciences and did not tend to 
illustrate or lead to any larger truths bacon men 
tions as recent discoveries which gave him courage 
and hope with regard to the future progress of human 
knowledge the invention of gunpowder glass and 
printing the introduction of silk and the discovery of 
america yet which of these can he said to have been 
the results of a theoretical enlargement of human 
knowledge except perhaps the discovery of the new 
world which was in some degree tlifc result of colum 
bus oonviction of the globular form of the earth 
thi however was not a recent but a very ancient 
nov oru g 



 formation of science 

doctrine of all sound astronomers and which of these 
discoveries has been the cause of a great enlargement 
of our theoretical knowledge — except any one claims 
such a merit for the discovery of printing in which 
sense the result is brought about in a very indirect 
manner in the same way in which the progress of 
freedom and of religion may be ascribed as conse 
quences to the same discovery however great or 
striking then such discoveries have been they have 
not generally speaking produced any marked advance 
of the inductive sciences in the sense in which we 
here speak of them they have increased man’s 
power it may be that is his power of adding to his 
comforts and communicating with his fellowmen 
but they have not necessarily or generally increased 
his theoretical knowledge and therefore with what 
ever admiration we may look upon such discoveries as 
these we are not to admire them as steps in inductive 
science 

and on the other hand we are not to ask of in 
ductive science as a necessary result of her progress 
such additions as these to man’s means of enjoyment 
and action it is said with a feeling of triumph that 
knowledge is power but in whatever sense this may 
truly be said we value knowledge not because it is 
power but because it is knowledge and we estimate 
wrongly both the nature and the dignity of that kind 
of science with which we are here concerned if we 
expect that evbry new advance in theory will forth 
with have a market value — that science will mark 
the birth of a new truth with some new birthday 
present such as a softer stuff to wrap our limbs a 
brighter vessel to grace oar table a new mode of com 
munication with our friends and the world a new in 
strument for the destruction of our enemies or a new 
region which may be the source of wealth and interest 

 yet though as we have said many of the most 
renfarkable processes which we reckon as the triumphs 
of art did not result from a previous progress of sci 
ence we have at many points of the history of science 
applications of new view t s to enable man to do as veil 



application of inductive truths 

as to see when archimedes had obtained clear views 
of the theory of machines he forthwith expressed them 
in his bold practical boast ‘ give me whereon to stand 
and i will move the earth’ and his machines with 
which he is said to have handled the roman ships 
like toys and his burning mirrors with which he is 
reported to have set them on fire are at least possible 
plications of theoretical principles when he saw 
the waters rising in the bath as his body descended 
and rushed out crying have found the way’ what 
he had found was the solution of the practical ques 
tion of the quantity of silver mixed with the gold of 
hiero’s crown but the mechanical indentions of hero 
of alexandria which moved by the forc of air or of 
steam probably involved no exact theoretical notions 
of the properties of air or of steajn he devised a toy 
which revolved by the action of steam but by the force 
of steam exerted in issuing from an orifice not by its 
pressure or condensation and the romans had no arts 
derived from science in addition to those which they 
inherited from the greeks they built aqueducts not 
indeed through ignorance of the principles of hydrosta 
tics as has sometimes been said for we who know our 
hydrostatics build aqueducts still but their practice 
exemplified only archimedean hydrostatics their 
clepsydras or waterclocks were adjusted by trial only 
they used arches and vaults more copiously than the 
greeks had done but the principle of the arch appears 
by the most recent researches to have been known to 
the greeks domes and groined arches such as we have 
in the pantheon and in the baths of oaracalla per 
haps they invented certainly they practised them 
a noble scale yet this was rather practical skill 
than theoretical knowledge and it was pursued by 
their successors in the middle ages in the same man 
ner as practical skill rather than theoretical know 
ledge thus were produced flying buttresses intersect 
ing pointed vaults and the other wonders of medkeval 
architecture the engineers of the fifteenth century 
as lonaydo da vinci began to convert their practical 
into theoretical knowledge of mechanics but still

clocks and watches flying machines and printing 
presses involved no new mechanical principle 

 but from this time the advances in science 
generally produced as their result new inventions of 
a practical kind thus the doctrine of the weight of 
air led to such inventions as the barometer used as 
a weatherglass the airpump with its train of curi 
ous experiments the divingbell the balloon the 
telescope was perhaps in some degree a discovery due 
to accident but its principles had been taught by 
koger bacon and still more clearly by descartes 
newton invented a steady thermometer by attending 
to steady laws of nature and in the case of the im 
provements of the steam engine made by watt we 
have an admirable example how superior the method 
of improving art by science is to the blind gropings 
of mere practical habit 

of this truth the history of most of the useful arts 
in our time offers abundant proofs and illustrations 
all improvements and applications of the forces and 
agencies which man employs for his purposes are now 
commonly made not by blind trial but with the 
clearest theoretical as well as practical insight which 
he can obtain into the properties of the agents which 
ho employs in this way he lias constructed using 
theory and calculation at every step of his construc 
tion steam engines steam boats screwpropellers 
locomotive engines railroads and bridges and struc 
tures of all kinds lightningconductors have been 
improved and applied to the preservation of buildings 
and especially of ships with admirable effect by sir 
wm snow harris an experimenter who has studied 
with great care the theory of electricity the mea 
surement of the quantity of oxygen that is of vital 
 lower in air has been taught by cavendish and by 
dr lire a skilful chemist of our time methods for

battery in order to protect ships’ bottoms from corro

those who ere about to dig for coal where it could 
have no geological place advice which has saved them 
from ruinous expence sir roderick murchison from 
geological evidence declared the likelihood of gold be 
ing found abundantly in australia many years before 
tiie diggings began 

even the subtle properties of light as shewn in the 
recent discoveries of its interference and polarization 
have been applied to useful purposes young invented 
an eriometer an instrument which should measure the 
fineness of the threads of wool by the coloured fringes 
which they produce and substances whjch it is im 
portant to distinguish in the manufacture of sugar 
are discriminated bv their effect jn rotating the plane 
of polarization of light one substance has been termed 
dextrin from its impressing a rightliandod rotation 
on the plane of polarization 

and in a great number of arts and manufactures 
the necessity of a knowledge of theory to the right 
conduct of practice is familiarly acknowledged and 
assumed in the testing and smelting of metals in the 
fabrication of soap of candles of sugar in the dyeing 
and printing of woollen linen cotton and silken stuffs 
thcjuaster manufacturer has always the scientific che 
mist at his elbow — either a ‘consulting chemist’ to 
whom he may apply on a special occasion for such is 
now a regular profession or a chemist who day by 
day superintends controls and improves the processes 
which his workmen daily carry on in these cases 
though art long preceded science science now guides 
governs and advances art 

 other arts and manufactures which have arisen 
in modem times have been new creations produced by 
science and requiring a complete acquaintance with 
scientific processes to conduct them effectually and 
securely such are the photographic arts now so 
various in their form beginning with those which 
from their authors are called daguerrotype and tal 
botype such are the arts of electrotype modelling

and electrotype plating such are the arts of pre 
paring fulminating substances guncotton fulminate 
of silver and of mercury and the application of those 
arts to use in the fabrication of percussioncaps for 
guns such is the art of electric telegraphy from its 
first beginning to its last great attempt the electric 
cord which connects england and america such is 
the art of imitating by the chemistry of the laboratory 
the vegetable chemistry of nature and thus producing 
the flavour of the pear the apple the pineapple the 
melon the quince such is the art of producing in 
man a temporary insensibility to pain which was 
effected first through the means of sulphuric ether by 
dr jackson of america and afterwards through the 
use of chloroform by dr simpson of edinburgh in 
these cases and mapy others science has endowed 
man with new arts and though even in these arts 
which are thus the last results of science there is 
much which science cannot fully understand and ex 
plain still such cases cannot but be looked upon s 
notable verifications of the anticipations of those who 
in former times expected from the progress of science 
a harvest of material advantages to man 

we must now conclude our task by a few words on 
the subject of inductions involving ideas ulterior to 
those already considered

of the induction of causes 


aphorism lx 

in the induction of causes the principal maxim is that 
we must he careful to possess and to hpply with perfect 
clearness the fundamental idea on which the induction 
depends 

aphorism lxi 

the induction of substance of force of polarity go 
beyond mere laws of phenomena and may be considered as 
the induction of causes 

aphorism lxii 

the cause of certain phenomena being inferred we are 
led to inquire into the cause of this cause which inquiry 
must be conducted in the same manner as the previous one 
and thus we have the induction of ulterior causes 

aphorism lxiii 

in contemplating the series of causes which are themselves 
the effects of other causes we are necessarily led to assume a 
supreme cause in the order of causation as we assume a 
first cause in order of succession 

i yxe formerly stated the objects of the researches 
v of science to be laws of phenomena and 
causes and showed the propriety and the necessity of 
not resting in the former object ut extending our

 formation of science 

inquiries to the latter also inductions in which phe 
nomena are connected by relations of space time 
number and resemblance belong to the forineilass 
and of the methods applicable to such inductions we 
have treated already in proceeding to inductions 
governed by any ulterior ideas we can no longer lay 
down any special methods by which our procedure 
may be directed a few general remarks are all that 
we shall offer 

the principal maxim in such cases of induction is 
the obvious one — that we must be careful to possess 
and to apply with perfect clearness and precision the 
fundamental idti on which the induction depends 

we may illustrate this in a few cases 

 induction of substance — the idea of substance “ 
involves this axiom thgt the weight of the whole com 
pound must be equal to the weights of the separate 
elements whatever changes the composition or separa 
tion of the elements may have occasioned the appli 
cation of this maxim we may term the method of the 
balance we have seen elsewhere how the memor 
able revolution in chemistry the overthrow of phlo 
giston and the establishment of the oxygen theory 
was produced by the application of this method we 
have seen too that the same idea leads us to this 
maxim — that imponderable fluids are not to be 
admitted as chemical elements of bodies 

whether those which have been termed imponder 
able fluids — the supposed fluids which produce the 
phenomena of light heat electricity galvanism 
magnetism — really exist or no is a question not 
merely of the laws but of the causes of phenomena 
it is as has already been shown a question which we 
cannot help discussing but which is at present involved 
in great obscurity nor does it appear at all likely that 
we shall obtain a true view of the cause of light 
heat and electricity till we have discovered precise 
and general laws connecting optical tliermotical and

electrical phenomena with those chemical doctrines to 
which the idea of substance is necessarily applied 

 imuction of force — the inference of mecha 
nical forces figom phenomena has been so abundantly 
practised that it is perfectly familiar among scientific 
inquirers from the time of newton it has been the 
most common aim of mathematicians and a persua 
sion has grown up among them that mechanical forces 
— attraction and repulsion — are the only modes of 
action of the particles of bodies which we shall ulti 
mately have to consider i have attempted to show 
that this mode of conception is inadequate to the pur 
poses of sound philosophy • — that the particles of 
crystals and the elements of chemical compounds 
must be supposed to be combined in some other way 
than by mere mechanical attraction and repulsion 
dr faraday has gone further m shaking the usual con 
ceptions of the force exerted in wellknown cases 
among the most noted and conspicuous instances of 
attraction and repulsion exerted at a distance were 
those which take place between electrized bodies but 
the eminent electrician just mentioned has endeavoured 
to establish by experiments of which it is very diffi 
cult to elude the weight that the action in these cases 
docs not take place at a distance but is the result of 
 chain of intermediate particles connected at every 
point by forces of another kind 

 induction of polarity — the forces to which 
dr faraday ascribes the action ill these cases are 
polar forces we have already endeavoured to ex 
plain the idea of polar forces which implies” that at 
every point forces exactly equal act in opposite direc 
tions and thus in the greater part of their course 
neutralize and conceal each other while at the extre 
mities of the line being by some cause liberated they 
are manifested still equal and opposite and the cri 
terion by which this polar character of forces is re 
cognized is implied in the reasoning of faracfcay on 
the question of one or two electiicities of which we 


 researches th series b v c i 



 formation of science 

formerly spoke the maxim is this — that in the 
action of polar forces along with every manifestation 
of force or property there exists a corresponding and 
simultaneous manifestation of an equl and opposite 
force or property 

 as it was the habit of the last age to reduce all 
action to mechanical forces the present race of physical 
speculators appears inclined to reduce all forces to 
polar forces mosotti has endeavoured to show that the 
positive and negative electricities pervade all bodies 
and that gravity is only an apparent excess of one of 
the kinds over the other as we have seen faraday 
has given strong experimental grounds for believing 
that the supposed remote actions of electrized bodies 
are really the effects of polar forces among contiguous 
particles if this doctrine were established with re 
gard to all electrical magnetical and chemical forces 
we might ask whether while all other forces are 
polar gravity really affords a single exception to the 
universal rule is not the universe pervaded by an 
omnipresent antagonism a fundamental conjunction of 
contraries everywhere opposite nowhere independent 
we are as yet far from the position in which induc 
tive science can enable us to answer such inquiries 

 induction of ulterior causes — tlitf first induc 
tion of a cause does not close the business of scientific 
inquiry behind proximate causes there are ulterior 
causes perhaps a succession of such gravity is the 
cause of the motions of the planets but what is the 
cause of gravity this is a question which has occu 
pied men’s minds from the time of newton to the pre 
sent day earthquakes and volcanoes are the causes 
of many geological phenomena but what is the cause 
of those subterraneous operations this inquiry after 
ulterior causes is an inevitable result from the intellec 
tual constitution of man he discovers mechanical 
causes but he cannot rest in them he must needs 
ask whence it is that matter has its universal power of 
attracting matter he discovers polar forces but even 


book v c i 



of the induction of causes i 

if these be universal he still desires a further insight 
into the cause of this polarity he sees in organic 
structures convincing marks of adaptation to an end 
whence he asks is this adaptation he traces in the 
history of the earth a chain of causes and effects ope 
rating through time but what he inquires is the 
power which holds the end of this chain 

thus we are referred back from step to step in the 
order of causation in the same manner as in the palse 
tiological sciences we were referred back in the order 
of time we make discovery after discovery in the 
various regions of science each it may be satisfactory 
and in itself complete but none final something 
always remains undone the last question answered 
the answer suggests still another question the strain 
of music from the lyre of science flows on rich and 
sweet full and harmonious ttut never reaches a close 
no cadence is heard with which the intellectual ear can 
feel satisfied 

of the supreme cause — in the utterance of science 
no cadence is heard with which the human mind can 
feel satisfied yet we cannot but go on listening for 
and expecting a satisfactory close the notion of a 
cadence appears to be essential to our relish of the 
music the idea of some closing strain seems to lurk 
among our own thoughts waiting to be articulated in 
the notes which flow from the knowledge of external 
nature the idea of something ultimate in our philo 
sophical researches something in which the mind can 
acquiesce and which will leave us no further questions 
to ask of whence and why and by what power seems 
as if it belonged to us — as if we could not have it 
withheld from us by any imperfection or incomplete 
ness in the actual performances of science what is 
the meaning of this conviction what is the reality 
thus anticipated whither does the developement of 
this idea conduct us 

we have already seen that a difficulty of the same 
kind which arises in the contemplation of causes and 
effects considered as forming an historical series drives 
fls to the assumption of a first cause as an axiom 



 formation of science 

to which our idea of causation in time necessarily 
leads and as we were thus guided to a first cause 
in order of succession the same kind of necessity 
directs us to a supreme cause in order of causation 

on this most weighty subject it is difficult to speak 
fitly and the present is not the proper occasion even 
for most of that which may be said but there are 
one or two remarks which flow from the general train 
of the contemplations we have been engaged in and 
with which this work must conclude 

we have seen how different arc the kinds of cause 
to which we are led by scientific researches mecha 
nical forces are insufficient without chemical affini 
ties chemical agencies fail us and we are compelled 
to have recourse to vital powers vital powers can 
not be merely physical and we must believe in some 
thing hyperpliysical something of the nature of a soul 
not only do biological inquiries lead us to assume an 
animal soul but they drive us much further they 
bring before us perception and will evoked by per 
ception still more these inquiries disclose to us ideas 
as the necessary forms of perception in the actions 
of which we ourselves arc conscious we are aware 
we cannot help being aware of our ideas and our 
volitions as belonging to us and thus we pass from 
things to ymrsous we have the idea of personality 
awakened and the idea of design and purpose of 
which we are conscious in our own minds we find 
reflected back to ue with a distinctness which we can 
not overlook in all the arrangements which constitute 
the frame of organized beings 

we cannot but reflect how widely diverse are the 
kinds of principles thus set before us — by what vast 
strides we mount from the lower to the higher as we 
proceed through that series of causes which the range 
of the sciences thus brings under our notice yet 
we know how narrow is the range of these sciences 
when compared with the whole extent of human know 
ledge we cannot doubt that on many other subjects 
besides those included in physical speculation riiandias 
made out solid and satisfactory trains of connexion— 



op the induction of causes 


has discovered clear and indisputable evidence of caus 
ation it is manifest therefore that if we are to 
attempt to ascend to the supreme cause — if we are 
to try to frame an idea of the cause of all these sub 
ordinate causes — we must conceive it as more dif 
ferent from any of them than the most diverse are 
from each other — more elevated above the highest 
than the highest is above the lowest 

but further — though the supreme cituse must thus 
be inconceivably different from all subordinate causes 
and immeasurably elevated above them all it must 
still include in itself all that is essential to each of 
them by virtue of that very circumstance that it is 
the cause of their causality time and space — in 
finilfe time and infinite space — must be among its 
attributes for we cannot but conceive infinite time 
and space as attributes of tiie infinite cause of the 
universe force and matter must depend upon it 
for their efficacy for we cannot conceive the activity 
of force or the resistance of matter to be independent 
powers but these are its lowef attributes the vital 
powers the animal soul which are the causes of the 
actions oliving things are only the effects of the 
supreme cause of life and this cause even in the 
lowest forms of organized bodies and still more in 
those which stand higher in the scale involves a 
reference to ends and purposes in short to manifest 
final causes since this is so and since even when 
we contemplate ourselves in a vier studiously nar 
rowed we still find that we have ideas and will and 
personality it would render our philosophy utterly 
incoherent and inconsistent with itself to suppose that 
personality and ideas and will and purpose do not 
belong to the supreme cause from which we derive 
all that we have and all that we are 

but we may go a step further — though in our 
present field of speculation we confine ourselves to 
knowledge founded on the facts which the external 
world presents to us we cannot ffirget in speaking of 
such a ftieme as that to which we have thus been led 
that these are but a small and the least significant 



 


formation of science 


portion of the facts which bear upon it we cannot 
fail to recollect that there are facts belonging to the 
world within us which more readily and strongly 
direct our thoughts to the supreme cause of all 
things we can plainly discern that we have ideas 
elevated above the region of mechanical causation of 
animal existence even of mere choice and will which 
still have a clear and definite significance a permanent 
and indestructible validity we perceive as a fact 
that we have a conscience judging of right and 
w rong that we have ideas of moral good and evil 
that wc arc compelled to conceive the organization 
of the moral world as well as of the vital frame to 
be directed to an end and governed by a purpose 
and since the supreme cause is the cause of iese 
facts the origin of these ideas we cannot refuse to 
recognize him as not only the maker but the gover 
nor of the world as not only a creative but a pro 
vidential power as not only a universal father but 
an ultimate judge 

we have already passed beyond the boundary of 
those speculations which we proposed to ourselves as 
the basis of our conclusions yet we maye allowed 
to add one other reflection if we find in ourselves 
ideas of good and evil manifestly bestowed upon us 
to be the guides of our conduct which guides we yet 
find it impossible consistently to obey — if we find our 
selves directed even by our natural light to aim at a 
perfection of our fhoral nature from which we are con 
stantly deviating through weakness and perverseness 
if when we thus lapse and err we can find in the 
region of human philosophy no power which can efface 
our aberrations or reconcile our actual with our ideal 
being or give us any steady hope and trust with re 
gard to our actions after we have thus discovered their 
incongruity with their genuine standard — if we dis 
cern that this is our condition how can we fail to see 
that it is in the highest degree consistent with all the 
indications supplied by such a philosophy as that of 
which we have been attempting to lay the foundations 
that the supreme caue through whom man exists as 



of the induction of causes 

a moral being of vast capacities and infinite hopes 
should have himself provided a teaching for our igno 
rance a propitiation for our sin a support for our 
weakness a purification and sanctification of our 
nature 

and thus in concluding our lonf survey of the 
grounds and structure of science and of the lessons 
which the study of it teaches us we find ourselves 
brought to a point of view in which we can cordially 
sympathize and more than sympathize with all the 
loftiest expressions of admiration and reverence and 
hope and trust which have been uttered by those who 
in former times have spoken of the elevated thoughts 
to which the contemplation of the nture and progress 
of human knowledge gives rise we cafi not only hold 
with galen and harvey and all the great physio 
logists that the organs of anitnals give evidence of a 
purpose — not only assert with cuvier that this con 
viction of a purpose can alone enable us to understand 
every part of every living thing — not only say with 
newton that ‘every true step made in philosophy 
brings us nearer to the first cause and is on that 
account highly to be valued — and that ‘ the business 
of natural philosophy is to deduce causes from effects 
till we come to the very first cause which certainly is 
not mechanical’ — but we can go much further and 
declare still with newton that £ this beautiful system 
could have its origin no other way than by the pur 
pose and command of an intelligent and powerful being 
who governs all things not as the soul of the world 
but as the lord of the universe who is not oidy god 
but lord and governor’ 

when we have advanced so far there yet remains 
one step we may recollect the prayer of one the 
master in this school of the philosophy of science 
‘this also we humbly and earnestly beg — that hu 
man things may not prejudice such as arc divine — 
neither that from the unlocking of the gates of seilae and 
the kindling of a greater natural light anything may 
arise af incredulity or intellectual night towards divine 
masteries but rather that by our minds thoroughly 



formation of science 


 

purged and cleansed from fancy and vanity and yet 
subject and perfectly given up to the divine oracles 
there may be given unto faith the things that are 
faith’s’ when we are thus prepared for a higher 
teaching we may be ready to listen to a greater than 
bacon when ht says to those who have sought their 
god in the material universe ‘whom ye ignorantly 
worship him declare t unto you’ and when we re 
collect how utterly inadequate all human language has 
been shown to be to express the nature of that su 
preme cause of the natural and rational and moral 
and spiritual world to which our philosophy points 
with trembling finger and shaded eyes we may receive 
with the less wohder but with the more reverence 
the declaration which has been vouchsafed to us

introduction 

i t lias been shown in the history of the sciences 
and lias further appeared in the course of the 
history of ideas that almost every step in the pro 
gress of science is marked by the formation or appro 
priation of a technical term common language has 
in most cases a certain degree of looseness and ambi 
guity as common knowledge has usually something of 
vagueness and indistinctness in common cases too 
knowledge usually docs not occupy the intellect alone 
but more or less interests some affection or puts in 
action the fancy and common language accommo 
dating itself to the office of expressing such know 
ledge contains in every sentence a tinge of emotion 
or of imagination but when our knowledge becomes 
perfectly exact and purely intellectual we require a 
language which shall so be exact and intellectual — 
which shall exclude alike vagueness and fancy imper 
fection and superfluity — in which each term shall 
convey a meaning steadily fixed and rigorously limited 
such a language that of science becomes • through the 
use of technical terms and we must now endeavour 
to lay down some maxims and suggestions by atten 
tion f to which technical terms may be better fitted to 
answer their purpose in order to tlo this we shall in 
nov oita 



 aphorisms concerning 

the first place take a rapid survey of the manner in 
which technical terms have been employed from the 
earliest periods of scientific history 

the progress of the use of technical scientific lan 
guage offers to our notice two different and successive 
periods in the first of which technical terms were 
formed casually as convenience in each case prompted 
while in the second period technical language was coni 
structed intentionally with set purpose with a regard 
to its connexion and with a view of constructing a 
system though the casual and the systematic formal 
tion of technical terms cannot be separated by any 
precise date of time for at all periods some terms in 
some sciences have been framed unsystematically we 
may as a general description call the former the an 
cient and the latter the modern period in illustrating 
the two following aphorisms i will give examples of 
the course followed in each of these periods 


aphorism i 

in the ancient period of sciences technical terms were 
formed in three different ways — by appropriating common 
words and fixing their meaning — by constructing terms 
containing a description — by constructing terms containing 
reference to a theory 

the earliest sciences offer the earliest examples of 
technical terms these are geometry arithmetic and 
astronomy to which we have soon after to add har 
monics mechanics and optics i these sciences we 
may notice the abovemen tipned •three different modes 
in which technical terms were formed 

i the simplest and first mode of acquiring techni 
cal terms is to take words current in common usage 
and by rigorously defining or otherwise fixing their 
meaning to fit them for the expression of scientific 
truths in this manner almost all the fundamental 
technical terms of geometry were formed a sphere 
a cone a cylinder had among the greeks at farst 



the language of science 


 

meanings less precise than those which geometers gave 
to these words and besides the mere designation of 
fdhn implied some use or application a sphere 
crfalpa was a handball used in games a cone kwvos 
was a boy’s spinningtop or the crest of a helmet a 
cylinder kvlvpos was a roller a cube kvos was a 
die till these words were adopted by the geometefs 
£nd made to signify among them pure modilications of 
space so an angle ywvta was only a corner a point 
oxciov was a signal a line ypapprj was a mark a 
straight line evoda was marked by an adjective which 
at first meant only direct a plane hrnvov is the 
neuter form of an adjective which hy its derivation 
means on the ground and hence flat jtn all these 
cases the word adopted as a term of science has its 
sense rigorously fixed and whee the common use of 
the term is in any degree vague its meaning may be 
modified at the same time that it is thus limited 
thus a rhombus poxo by its derivation might mean 
any figure which is twisted out of a regular form but 
it is confined by geometers to that figure which has 
four equal sides its angles being oblique in like 
manner a trapezium rpatriov originally signifies a 
table and thus might denote any form but as the ta 
bles of the greeks had one side shorter than the oppo 
site cue such a figure was at first called a trapezium 
afterwards the term was made to signify any figure 
with four unequal sides a name being more needful in 
geometry for this kind of figure than for the original 
form 

this class of technical terms namely words adopted 
from common language but rendered precise and de 
terminate for purposes of science may also be exem 
plified in other sciences thus as was observed in the 
early portion of the history of astronomy a day a 
month a year described at first portions of time marked 
by familiar changes but afterwards portions determined 
by rigorous mathematical definitions the conception 
of the heavens as a revolving sphere is so obvioudj

aphorisms concerning 


that we may consider the terms which involve this 
conception as parts of common language as the pole 
x the arctic circle which includes th e stars tliht 
never set® the horizon pt£wv a boundary applied 
technically to the circle bounding the visible earth 
and sky the turnings of the sun rpoiral vjexioio 
which are mentioned by hesiod gave occasion to the 
term tropics the circles at which the sun in his annuli 
motion turns back from his northward or southward 
advance the zones of the earth the torrid tempe 
rate and frigid the gnomon of a dial the limb or 
border of the moon or of a circular instrument are 
terms of the same class an eclipse ocatuas is origi 
nally a deficiency or disappearance and joined with 
the name of the luminary an eclipse of the sun or of 
the moon described the phenomenon but when the 
term became technical it sufficed without addition to 
designate the phenomenon 

in mechanics the greeks gave a scientific precision 
to very few words we may mention weights apea 
the arms of a lever pea its fulcrum ifmopioxiov 
and the verb to balance lropporclv other terms 
which they used as momentum poirrj and force svvapus 
did not acquire a distinct and definite meaning till the 
time of galileo or later we may observe that all 
abstract terms though in their scientific application 
expressing mere conceptions were probably at first 
derived from somc word describing external objects 
thus the latin word for force vis seems to be con 
nected with a greek word u or fm which often has 
nearly the same meaning but originally as it would 
seem signified a sinew or muscle the obvious seat of 
animal strength 

in later times the limitation imposed upon a word 
by its appropriation to scientific purposes is often 
more marked than in the cases above described thus 
thq variation is made to mean in astronomy the se 
cond inequality gf the moon’s motion in magnetism 
flie variation signifies the angular deviation of the

the variation of a quantity is the formula which ex 
presses th result of any small change of the most 
general kind in like manner parallax irapawai 
denotes a change in general hut is used by astronomers 
to signify the change produced by the spectator’s being 
removed from the center of the earth his theoretical 
place to the surface a llcali at first denoted the ashes 
of a particular plant but afterwards all bodies having 
a certain class of chemical properties and in like 
manner acid the class opposed to alkali was modified 
in signification by chemists so as to refer no longer to 
the taste 

words thus borrowed from common language and 
converted by scientific writers into technical terms 
have some advantages and some disadvantages they 
possess this great convenience hat they are under 
stood after a very short explanation and retained in 
the memory without effort on the other hand they 
lead to some inconvenience for since they have a 
meaning in common language a careless reader is 
prone to disregard the technical limitation of this 
meaning and to attempt to collect their import in sci 
entific books in the same vague and conjectural man 
ner in which he collects the purpose of words in com 
mon cadis hence the language of science when thus 
resliiibling common language is liable to be employed 
with an absence of that scientific precision which alone 
gives it value popular writers and talkers when they 
speak of force momentum action and reaction and 
the like often afford examples of the inaccuracy thus 
arising from the scientific appropriation of common 
terms 

ii another class of technical teitns which we 
find occurring as soon as speculative science assumes a 
distinct shape consists of those which are intentionally 
constructed by speculators and which contain some 
description or indication distinctive of the conception 
to which they are applied such ara a parallelogram 
trapaxkrjxypaiapov which denotes a plane figure 
bounded by two pairs of parallel lins a parallelepiped 



 


aphorisms concerning 


trapawrjxotrltresov which signifies a solid figure 
bounded by three pairs of parallel planes a triangle 
rprywvos trigon and a quadrangle retpor wo tetra 
gon were perhaps words invented independently of 
the mathematicians but such words extended to other 
cases pentagon decagon hecccedecagon polygon are 
inventions of scientific men such also are tetrahe 
dron hexahedron dodecahedron tesseracontaoctohedron 
polyhedron and the like these words being con 
structed by speculative writers explain themselves or 
at least require only some conventional limitation 
easily adopted thus parallelogram might mean a 
figure bounded by any number of sets of parallel lines 
but it is conventionally restricted to a figure o i four 
sides so a great circle in a sphere means one which 
passes through the center of the sphere and a small 
circle is any other so in trigonometry we have the 
 hypotenuse vrot€vovcra or subtending line to desig 
nate the line subtending an angle and especially a 
right angle in this branch of mathematics we have 
many invented technical terms as complement supple 
ment cosine cotangent a spherical angle the pole of a 
circle or of a sphere the word sine itself appears to 
belong to the class of terms already described as sci 
entific appropriations of common terms although its 
origin is somewhat obscure 

mathematicians were naturally led to construct 
these and many other terms by the progress of their 
speculations in like manner when astronomy took 
the form of a speculative science words were invented 
to denote distinctly the conceptions thus introduced 
thus the sun’s annual path among the stars in which 
not only solar but also all lunar eclipses occur was 
termed the ecliptic the circle which the sun describes 
in his diurnal motion when the days and nights are 
equal the greeks called the equidiurnal lorjpepivos 
the latin astronomers the equinoctial and the corre 
sponding circle on the earth was the equator the 
ecliptic intersected the equinoctial in the equinoctial 
points the solstices in greek tpoirai were the times 
when the sun arrested his motion north wards or south 



the language of science 

wards and the solstitial points fra tpomka crxeia 
were the places in the ecliptic where he then was 
the name of meridians was given to circles passing 
through the poles of the equator the solstitial colure 
icoxovpos curtailed was one of these circles which 
passes through the solstitial points and is intercepted 
by the horizon 

we have borrowed from the arabians various astro 
nomical terms as zenith nadir azimuth almachntar 
and these words which among the arabians probably 
belonged to the first class of appropriated scientific 
terms are for us examples of the second class invented 
scientific terms although they differ from most that 
we have mentioned in not containing an etymology 
corresponding to their meaning in any ‘language with 
which european cultivators of science are generally 
familiar indeed the distinction of our two classes 
though convenient is in a great measure casual thus 
most of the words we formerly mentioned as parallax 
horizon eclipse though appropriated technical terms 
among the greeks are to us invented technical terms 

in the construction of such terms as we are now con 
sidering those languages have a great advantage which 
possess a power of forming words by composition this 
was eminently the case with the greek language and 
hence most of the ancient terms of science in that lan 
guage when their origin is once explained are clearly 
understood and easily retained of modern european 
languages the german possesses the greatest facility of 
composition and hence scientific authors in that lan 
guage are able to invent terms which it is impossible 
to imitate in the other languages of europe thus 
weiss distinguishes his various systems of crystals as 
zweiundzweigliedrig einundzweigliedrig dreyund 
dreygliedrig doc twoandtwomembered oneand 
twomembered c and hessel also a writer on 
crystallography speaks of doublyonemembered edges 
fourandthree spaced rays and the like 

how far the composition of weirds in such cases 
may be practised in the english language and the 
gefieral question what are the byst rules and artifices 



 aphorisms concerning 

in such cases i shall afterwards consider in the 
mean time i may observe that this list of invented 
technical terms might easily be much enlarged thus 
in harmonics we have the various intervals as a fourth 
a fifth an octave diatessaron diapente diapason a 
comma which is the difference of a major and minor 
tone we have the various moods or keys and the 
notes of various lengths as minims breves semibreves 
quavers in chemistry gas was at first a technical 
term invented by van helmont though it has now 
been almost adopted into common language i omit 
many words which will perhaps suggest themselves to 
the reader because they belong rather to the next 
class which i now proceed to notice 

iii the third class of technical terms consists of 
such as are constructed by men of science and involve 
some theoretical idea in the meaning which their deri 
vation implies they do not merely describe like the 
class last spoken of but describe with reference to 
some doctrine or hypothesis which is accepted as a 
portion of science thus latitude and longitude ac 
cording to their origin signify breadth and length 
they are used however to denote measures of the dis 
tance of a place on the earth’s surface from the equator 
and from the first meridian of which distances one 
cannot be called length more properly than the other 
but this appropriation of these words may be explained 
by recollecting that the earth as known to the ancient 
geographers wa much further extended from east to 
west than from north to south the precession of the 
equinoxes is a term which implies that the stars are 
fixed while the point which is the origin of the mea 
sure of celestial longitude moves backward the bight 
ascension of a star is a measure of its position corre 
sponding to terrestrial longitude this quantity is iden 
tical with the angular ascent of the equinoctial point 
when the star is in the horizon in a right sphere that 
is a sphere which supposes the spectator to be at the 
equator the oblique ascension a term now little 
used is derived in like manner from an oblique sphere 
the motion of a planet is direct or retrograde in cin 



the language of science 


sequentia signa or in antecedentia in reference to a 
certain assumed standard direction for celestial motions 
namely tjie direction opposite to that of the sun’s daily 
motion and agreeing with his annual motion among 
the stars or faith what is much more evident the 
moon’s monthly motion the equation of time is the 
quantity which must be added to or subtracted from 
the time marked by the sun in order to reduce it to a 
theoretical condition of equable progress al like 
manner the equation of the center of the sun or of the 
moon is the angle which must be added to or sub 
tracted from the actual advance of the luminary in 
the heavens in order to make its motion equable 
besides the equation of the center c £ the moon which 
represents the first and greatest of her deviations from 
equable motion there are many other equations by 
the application of which her motion is brought nearer 
and nearer to perfect uniformity the second of these 
equations is called the erection the third the variation 
the fourth the annual equation the motion of the 
sun as affected by its inequalities is called his anomaly 
which term denotes inequalit in the history of 
astronomy we find that the inequable motions of the 
sun moon and planets were in a great measure re 
duced to rule and system by the greeks by the aid of 
an hypothesis of circles revolving and carrying in 
tfieir motion other circles which also revolved this 
hypothesis introduced many technical terms as de 
ferent epicycle eccentric in like planner the theo 
ries which have more recently taken the place of the 
theory of epicycles have introduced other technical 
terms as the elliptical orbit the radius vector and the 
equable description of areas by this radius which phrases 
express the true laws of the planetary motions 

there is no subject on which theoretical views have 
been so long and so extensively prevalent as astronomy 
and therefore no other science in which there are so 
many technical terms of the kind we are now consider 
ing but in other subjects also so t far as theories have 
been established they have been accompanied by the 
iiftroduction or fixation of technical terms thus as

we have seen in the examination of thefoundations of 
mechanics the terms force and inertia derive their 
precise meaning from a recognition of the fyst law of 
motion accelerating force and composition of motion 
involve the second law moving force momentum action 
and reaction are expressions which imply the third law 
the term vis viva was introduced to express a general 
property of moving bodies and other terms have been 
intro aced for like purposes as impetus by smeaton 
and work done by other engineers in the recent 
writings of several french engineers the term travail 
is much employed to express the work done and the

labouring force tlie proposition which was termed 
the hydrostatic paradox had this name in reference to 
its violating a supposed law of the action of forces 
the verb to gravitate and the abstract term gravita 
tion sealed the establishment of newton’s theory of 
the solar system 

in some of the sciences opinions either false or 
disguised in very fantastical imagery have prevailed 
and the terms which have been introduced during the 
reign of such opinions bear the impress of the time 
thus in the days of alchemy the substances with 
which the operator dealt were personified and a metal 
when exhibited pure and free from all admixture was 
considered as a little king and was hence called a 
regulus a term not yet quite obsolete in like man 
ner a substance from which nothing more of any value 
could be extracted was dead and was called a capu 
mortuum quick silver that is live silver argentum 
vivum was killed by certain admixtures and was re 
vived when restored to its pure state 

• we find a great number of medical terms which 
bear the mark of opinions formerly prevalent among 
physicians and though these opinions hardly form a 
part of the progress of science and were not presented 
in oui history we may notice some of these terms as 
examples of the mqde in which words involve in their 
derivation obsolete opinions such words as hysterics 
hypochondriac melancholy cholera colic quinsey sqixi

ancient anatomists as duodenum a certain portion of 
the intestines which they estimated as twelve inches 
long we might add other allusions as the tendon of 
achilles 

astrology also supplied a number of words founded 
upon fanciful opinions but thig study having been 
expelled from the list of sciences such words now sur 
vive only so far as they have found a place in common 
language thus men were termed mercurial myrtial 
jovial or saturnine accordingly as their characters 
were supposed to be determined by theunfluenee of the

expressions such as disastrous illstarred exorbitant 
ibrd of the ascendant and lienge ascendancy influence 



 


aphorisms concerning 


a sphere of action flnd the like may serve to show 
how extensively astrological opinions have affected 
language though the doctrine is no longer a recognized 
science 

the preceding examples will make it manifest that 
opinions even of a recondite and complex kind are 
often implied in the derivation of words and thus will 
show how scientific terms framed by the cultivators 
of scierfce may involve received hypotheses and theo 
ries when terms are thus constructed they serve 
not only to convey with ease but to preserve steadily 
and to diffuse widely the opinions which they tipis 
assume moreover they enable the speculator to em 
ploy these complex conceptions the creations of sci 
ence and the results of much labour and thought as 
readily and familiarly as if they were convictions bor 
rowed at once from the senses they are thus power 
ful instruments in enabling jriiilosophers to ascend 
from one stej of induction and generalization to an 
other and hereby contribute powerfully to the ad 
vance of knowledge and truth 

it should be noticed before we proceed that the 
names of natural objects when they come to be con 
sidered as the objects of a science are selected accord 
ing to the processes already enumerated for the 
most part the natural historian adopts the common 
names of animals plants minerals gems and the like’ 
and only endeavours to secure their steady and consis 
tent application put many of these names imply some 
peculiar often fanciful belief respecting the object 

various plants derive their names from their sup 
posed virtues as herniaria rupturewort or from le 
gends as herba sancti johannis t johns wort the 
same is the case with minerals thus the toaz was 
asserted to come from an island so shrouded in mists 
that navigators could only conjecture roirdtiv where 
it was in these latter cases however the legend is 
often not the true origin of the name but is suggested 
by it 

the privilege of constructing names where they are 
wanted belongs to natural historians no less than tb 



the language op science 


 

the cultivators of physical science yet in the ancient 
world writers of the former class appear rarely to 
have exercised this privilege even when they felt the 
imperfections pf the current language thus aristotle 
repeatedly mentions classes of animals which have no 
name as coordinate with classes that have names 
but he hardly ventures to propose names which may 
supply these defects the vast importance of nomen 
clature in natural history was not recognized till the 
modern period 

we have however hitherto considered only the ‘ 
formation or appropriation of single terms in science 
except so far as several terms may in some instances 
be connected by reference to a common theory but 
when the valuo of technical terms began to be fully 
appreciated philosophers proceeded to introduce them 
into their sciences more copiously and in a more syste 
matic manner in this way the modern history of 
technical language lias some features of a different 
aspect from the ancient and must give rise to a sepa 
rate aphorism 

aphorism ii 

in the modern period of science besides the three pro 
cesses anciently employed in the formation of technical 
•tennis there have been introduced systematic nomenclature 
systematic terminology and the systematic modification of 
terms to express theoretical relations 

writers upon science have gone on up to modern 
times forming such technical terms as they had occa 
sion for by the three processes above described — 

 in his history of animals b i which lias since been adopted by na 
c vi he says that the great classes turalists 

of animals are quadrupeds birds on the subject of terminology 
fishes whales cetaceans oysters and nomenclature see also aplio

by a name malacostraca softslielled of itrminology and nomenclature 



 aphorisms concerning 

namely appropriating and limiting words in common 
use — constructing for themselves words descriptive of 
the conception which they wished to con r ey — or 
framing terms which by their signification imply the 
adoption of a theory thus among the terms intro 
duced by the study of the connexion between magnet 
ism and electricity the word pole is an example of the 
first kind the name of the subject electromagnetism 
of the second and the term current involving an hy 
pothesis of the motion of a fluid is an instance of the 
third class in chemistry the term salt was adopted 
from common language and its meaning extended to 
denote any compound of a certain kind the term neu 
tral salt implied the notion of a balanced opposition in 
the two elements of the compound and such words as 
subacid and super acid invented on purpose were in 
troduced to indicate the cases in which this balance 
was not attained again when the phlogistic theory 
of chemistry was established the term phlogiston was 
introduced to express the theory and from this such 
terms as phlogisticated and dephlogisticated were de 
rived exclusively words of science but in such in 
stances as have just been given we approach towards 
a systematic modification of terms jvhich is a peculiar 
process of modem times of this modern chemistry 
forms a prominent example which we shall soon con 
sider but we shall first notice the other processes men 
tioned in the aphorism 

i in ancient times no attempt was made to invent 
or select a nomenclature of the objects of natural 
history which should be precise and permanent the 
omission of this step by the ancient naturalists gave 
rise to enormous difficulty and loss of time when the 
sciences resumed their activity we have seen in the 
history of the sciences of classification and of botany 
in especial that the early cultivators of that study in 
modern times endeavoured to identify all the plants 
described by greek and iioman writers with those 
which grow in the north of europe and were involved 


 hist xnd sc b xvl c ii

i 


in endless confusion by the multiplication of names 
of plants at the same time superfluous and ambiguous 
the synwymies which botanists bauhin and others 
found it necessary to publish were the evidences of 
these inconveniences in consequence of the defective 
ness of the ancient botanical nomenclature we are 
even yet uncertain with respect to the identification of 
 some of the most common trees mentioned by classical 
writers the ignorance of botanists respecting the 
importance of nomenclature operated in another man 
ner to impede the progress of science as a good no 
menclature presupposes a good system of classification 
so on the other hand a system of classification cannot 
become permanent without a corresponding nomencla 
ture csesalpinus in the sixteenth cenfury published 
an excellent system of arrangement for plants but 
this not being connected with any system of names 
was never extensively accepted and soon fell into ob 
livion the business of framing a scientific botanical 
classification was in this way delayed for about a cen 
tury in the same manner willoughby’s classification 
of fishes though as cuvier says far better than any 
which preceded it was never extensively adopted in 
consequence of having no nomenclature connected 
with it 

 ii probably one main cause which so long retarded 
the work of fixing at the same time the arrangement 
and the names of plants was the great number of mi 
nute and diversified particulars in th£ structure of each 
plant which such a process implied the stalks leaves 
flowers and fruits of vegetables with their append 
ages may vary in so many ways that common lan 
guage is quite insufficient to express clearly and pre 
cisely their resemblances and differences hence 
botany required not only a fixed system of names of 
plants but also an artificial system of phrases fitted to 
describe their parts not only a nomenclature but also

a terminology the terminology was in fact an in 
strument indispensably requisite in giving “fixity to the 
nomenclature the recognition of the kinds of plants 
must depend upon the exact comparison of their re 
semblances and differences and to become a part of 
permanent science this comparison must be recorded 
in words 

the formation of an exact descriptive language for 
botany was thus the first step in that systematic con 
struction of the technical language of science which is 
one of the main features in the intellectual history of 
modern times the ancient botanists as de candolle 
says did not make any attempt to select terms of 
which the sense was rigorously determined and each 
of them employed in his descriptions the words meta 
phors or periphrases wfyicli his own genius suggested 
in the history of botany i have noticed some of the 
persons who contributed to this improvement chi 
sms’ it is there stated ‘first taught botanists to de 
scribe well he introduced exactitude precision neat 
ness elegance method he says nothing superfluous 
he omits nothing necessary’ this task was further 
carried on by jung and hay in these authors we 
see the importance which began to be attached to the 
exact definition of descriptive terms for example bay 
quotes jung’s definition of caulis a stalk 

the improvement of descriptive language and the 
formation of schemes of classification of plants went 
on gradually for ome time and was much advanced 
by tournefort but at last linnaeus embodied and 
followed out the convictions which had gradually been 
accumulating in the breasts of botanists and by re 
modelling throughout both the terminology and the 
nomenclature of botany produced one of the greatest 
reforms which ever took place in any science he 
thus supplied a conspicuous example of such a reform 
and a most admirable model of a language from which

other sciences may gather great instruction i shall 
not here give any account of the terms and words in 
troduced by linnaeus they have been exemplified in 
the history of science and the principles which they 
involve i shall consider separately hereafter i vyill 
only remin the reader that the great simplification in 
nomenclature which was the result of his labours con 
sisted in designating each kind of plant by a binary 
term consisting of the name of the genus combined 
with that of the species an artifice seemingly obvious 
but more convenient in its results than could possibly 
have been anticipated 

 since linnaeus the progress of botanical anatomy 
and of descriptive botany have led to t£e rejection of 
several inexact expressions and to the adoption of 
several new terms especially in describing the struc 
ture of the fruit and the parts of cryptogamous plants 
hedwig medikus necker desvaux mirbel and es 
pecially gsertner link and itichard have proposed 
several useful innovations in these as in other parts 
of the subject but the general mass of the words 
now current consists still and will probably continue 
to consist of the terms established by the swedish 
botanist 

when it was seen that botany derived so great ad 
vantages from a systematic improvement of its lan 
guage it was natural that other sciences and especially 
classificatory sciences should endeavour to follow its 
example this attempt was made in mineralogy by 
werner and afterwards further pursued by mohs 
werner’s innovations in the descriptive language of 
mineralogy were the result of great acuteness an inti 
mate acquaintance with minerals and a most methodi 
cal spirit and were in most respects great improve 
ments upon previous practices yet the introduction 
of them into mineralogy was far from regenerating 
that science as botany had been regenerated by the 
limuean reform it would seem that the perpetual

scrupulous attention to most minute differences as of 
lustre colour fracture the greater part of which are 
not really important fetters the mind rather than 
disciplines it or arms it for generalization cuvier has 
remarked that werner after his first essay on the 
characters of minerals wrote little as if jie had been 
afraid of using the system which he had created and 
desirous of escaping from the chains which he had 
imposed upon others and he justly adds that werner 
dwelt least in his descriptions upon that which is 
really the most important feature of all the crystalline 
structure this which is truly a definite character 
like those of botany does when it can be clearly dis 
cerned determine the place of the mineral in a system 
this therefore is the character which of all others 
ought to be most carefully expressed by an appropriate 
language this task hardly begun by werner has 
since been fully executed by others especially by rom 
de l’lsle haiiy and mohs all the forms of crystals 
can be described in the most precise manner by the 
aid of the labours of these writers and their successors 
but there is one circumstance well worthy our notice 
in these descriptions it is found that the language 
in which they can best be conveyed is not that of 
words but of symbols the relations of space which 
are involved in the forms of crystalline bodies though 
perfectly definite are so complex and numerous that 
they cannot be expressed except in the language of 
mathematics and thus we have an extensive and 
recondite branch of mathematical science which is in 
fact only a part of the terminology of the minera 
logist 

the terminology of mineralogy being thus reformed 
an attempt was made to improve its nomenclature also 
by following the example of botany professor mohs 
was the proposer of this innovation the names framed 
by him were however not composed of two but of 
three elements designating respectively the species 
the genus and tfie order thus he has such species as

rhombohedral lime ilaloide octahedral fluor ilaloide 
prismatic hal baryte these names have not been 
generally adopted nor is it likely that any names 
constructed on such a scheme will find acceptance 
among mineralogists till the higher divisions of the 
system are found to have some definite character we 
see no real mineralogical significance in mohs’s genera 
find orders and hence we do not expect them to retain 
a permanent place in the science 

the only systematic names which have hitherto 
been generally admitted in mineralogy are those ex 
pressing the chemical constitution of the substance 
and these belong to a systdbi of technical terms dif 
ferent from any we have yet spoken of namely to 
terms formed by systematic modification 

iii the language of chemistry was already as we 
have seen tending to assume a systematic character 
even under the reign of the phlogiston theory but 
when oxygen succeeded to the throne it very fortu 
nately happened that its supporters had the courage 
and the foresight to undertake a completely new and 
systematic recoinage of the terms belonging to the sci 
ence the new nomenclature was constructed upon a 
principle hitherto hardly applied in science but emi 
nently commodious and fertile namely the principle 
of indicating a modification of relations of elements 
by a change in the termination of the word thus 
the new chemical school spoke of sul picric and sulph 
urous acids of sulphates and sulphites of bases and 
of sulphwrete of metals and in like manner of phos 
horic and phosphorous acids of phosphates phosphites 
phos phurets in this manner a nomenclature was pro 
duced in which the very name of a substance indicated 
at once its constitution and place in the system 

the introduction of this chemical language can never 
cease to be considered one of the most important steps 
ever made in the improvement of technical terms §nd 
as a signal instance of the advantage which may re 
sult from artifices apparently trivial if employed in a 
manner conformable to the laws of phenomena and 
systematically pursued it was however proved that

perfectly erroneous notion of the proportions of the 
elements they are called the protoxide the black 
oxide and the peroxide we are here thrown back 
upon terms quite unconnected with the system 

other defects in the nomenclature arose from errours 
in the theory as for example the names of the muri 
atic oxy muriatic and hyperoxymuriatic acids which 
after the establishment of the new theory of chlorine 
were changed to hydrochloric acid chlorine and chloric 
acid 

thus the chemical system of nomenclature founded 
upon the oxygen theory while it shows how much may 
be effected by a good and consistent scheme of terms 
framed according to the real relations of objects proves 
also that such a scheme can hardly be permanent in 
its original form bat will almost inevitably become 
imperfect and anomalous in consequence of the accu 
mulation of new facts and the introduction of new 
generalizations still we may venture to say that 
such a scheme does not on this account become worth 
less tor it not only answers its purpose in the stage of 
scientific progress to which it belongs — so far as it is 
not erroneous or merely conventional but really sys 
tematic and significant of truth its terms qin be trans 
lated at once into the language of any higher generali 
zation which is afterwards arrived at if terms express

relations really ascertained to be tfme they can never 
lose their value by any change of the received theory 
they are jike coins of pure metal which even when 
carried into a country which does not recognize the 
sovereign whose impress they bear are still gladly re 
ceived and may by the addition of an explanatory 
mark continue part of the common currency of the 
country 

these two great instances of the reform of scientific 
language in botany and in chemistry are much the 
most important and instructive events of this kind 
which the history of science offers it is not necessary 
to pursue our historical survey further our remain 
ing aphorisms respecting the language of science 
will be collected and illustrated indiscriminately from 
the precepts and the examples of preceding philoso 
phers of all periods 

we may however remark that aphorisms iii iv 
v vi vii respect peculiarly the formation of 
technical terms by the appropriation of common 
words while the remaining ones apply to the forma 
tion of new terms 

it does not appear possible to lay down a system of 
rules which may determine and regulate the construc 
tion of all technical terms on all the occasions on 
which the progress of science makes them necessary or 
convenient but if we can collect a few maxims such 
as have already offered themselves to the minds of phi 
losophers or such as may be justified by the instances 
by which we shall illustrate them these maxim may 
avail to guide us in doubtful cases and to prevent our 
aiming at advantages which are unattainable or being 
disturbed by seeming imperfections which are really 
no evils i shall therefore state such maxims of this 
kind as seem most sound and useful

aphorisms concerning 


aphorism iii 

in framing scientific terms the appropriafion of old 
words is preferable to the invention of nefl ones 

this maxim is stated by bacon in his usual striking 
manner after mentioning metaphysic as one of the 
divisions of natural philosophy lie adds ‘ wherein 
i desire it may be conceived that i use the word meta 
hysic in a different sense from that that is received 
and in like manner i doubt not but it will easily 
appear to men of judgment that in this and other par 
ticulars wheresoever my conception and notion may 
differ from the ancient yet i am studious to keep the 
ancient terms for hoping well to deliver myself from 
mistaking by the orde and perspicuous expressing of 
that i do propound i am otherwise zealous and affec 
tionate to recede as little from antiquity either in 
terms or opinions as may stand with truth and the 
proficience of knowledge to mo that do desire 
as much as lieth in my pen to ground a sociable inter 
course between antiquity and proficience it seemetli 
best to keep a way with antiquity usque ad aras and 
therefore to retain the ancient terms though i some 
times alter the uses and definitions according to the 
moderate proceeding in civil governments whenqj 
though there be some alteration yet that holdeth 
whidh tacitus wisely noteth eadem magistratuum 
vocahyfia 

we have had before us a sufficient number of ex 
amples of scientific terms thus framed for they formed 
the first of three classes which we described in the 
first aphorism and we may again remark that 
science when she thus adopts terms which are in com 
mon use always limits and fixes their meaning in 
a technical manner we may also repeat here the 
warning already given respecting terms of this kind 
that chey are peculiarly liable to mislead readers who 


 hi augm lib iii c iv 



the language of science 

do not take care to understand thefn in their technical 
instead of their common signification force momen 
tum inertia impetus vis viva are terms which are 
very useful if we rigorously bear in mind the import 
which belongs to each of them in the best treatises on 
mechanics but if the reader content himself with 
conjecturing their meaning from the context his 
knowledge will be confused and worthless 

in the application of this third aphorism other 
rules are to be attended to which i add 


aphotusm iy 

when common words are appropriated atechnical terms 
their meaning and relations in common use should be retained 
as far as can conveniently be don 

i wtll state an example in which this rule seems to 
be applicable mr davies gilbert has recently pro 
posed the term efficiency to designate the work which 
a machine according to the force exerted upon it is 
capable of doing the work being measured by the 
weight raised and the space through which it is raised 
jointly the usual term employed among engineers 
for the work which a machine actually does measured 
itf the way just stated is duty but as there appears 
to be a little incongruity in calling that work efficiency 
which the machine ought to do when we call that 
work duty which it really does i liave proposed to 
term these two quantities theoretical efficiency and 
practical efficiency or theoretical duty and practical 
duty 

since common words are often vague in their mean 
ing add as a necessary accompaniment to the third 
aphorism the following — 


 phil trans p retical dsy this term lias been 

 the term travail is used by french rendered in english by labouring 
engineers to express efficiency or theo force • 



 o 


aphorisms concerning 


aphorism v 

when common words are appropriated as technical terms 
their meaning may he modified and must bq rigorously fixed 

this is stated by bacon in the above extract ‘ to 
retain the ancient terms though i sometimes alter the 
uses and definitions the scientific use of the term is 
in all cases much more precise than the common use 
the loose notions of velocity and force for instance 
which are sufficient for the usual purposes of language 
require to be fixed by exact measures when these are 
made terms in the science of mechanics 

this scientific fixation of the meaning of words is to 
be looked upoii as a matter of convention although it 
is in reality often an inevitable result of the progress 
of science momentum is conventionally defined to be 
the product of the numbers expressing the weight and 
the velocity but then it could be of no use in ex 
pressing the laws of motion if it were defined otherwise 

hence it is no valid objection to a scientific term 
that the word in common language does not mean 
exactly the same as in its common use it is no 
sufficient reason against the use of the term acid for a 
class of bodies that all the substances belonging to 
this class are not sour we have seen that a trape 
zium is used in geometry for any foursided figtirfe 
though originally it meant a figure with two opposite 
sides parallel and the two others equal a certain 
stratum which lies below the chalk is termed by 
english geologists the green sand it has sometimes 
been objected to this denomination that the stratum 
has very frequently no tinge of green and that it is 
often composed of lime with little or no sand yet 
the term is a good technical term in spite of these 
apparent improprieties so long as it is carefully ap 
plied to that stratum which is geologically equivalent 
to thfv greenish sandy bed to which the appellation was 
originally applied 

when it appeared that geometry would have to be 
employed as much at least about the heavens as the 
earth plato exclaimed against the folly of calling the 



the language op science 


l 


science by such a name since the word signifies 
‘earthmeasuring’ yet the word geometry has retained 
its place nd answered its purpose perfectly well up to 
the present day 

but though the meaning of the term may be modi 
fied or extided it must be rigorously fixed when it is 
appropriated to science this process is most abun 
dantly exemplified by the terminology of natural his 
tory and especially of botany in which each term has 
a most precise meaning assigned to it thus linnaeus 
established exact distinctions between fasciculus capi 
tulum racemus thyrsus paniculus spica amentum 
corymbus umbella cyma verticillus or in the lan 
guage of english botanists a tuft a head a cluster a 
bunch a panicle a spike a catkin a corymb an umbel 
a cyme a whorl and it has since been laid down as 
a rule that each organ ought to have a separate and 
appropriate name so that the term leaf for instance 
shall never be applied to a leaflet a bractea or a sepal 
of the calyx 

botanists have not been content with fixing the 
meaning of their terms by verbal definition but have 
also illustrated them by figures which address the eye 
of these as excellent modem examples may be men 
tioned those which occur in the works of mirbel and 
lindley 

aphorism yi 

when common words are appropriated as technical terms 
this must be done so that they are not ambiguous in their 
application 

an example will explain this maxim the condi 
tions of a body as a solid a liquid and an air have 
been distinguished as different forms of the body but 
the word form as applied to bodies has other mean 
ings so that if we were to inquire in what form 
water exists in a snowcloud it might be doubted 
whether the forms of crystallization were meant or 

 de candolle theor el elmens de botaniquc 

 elements of botany 



 


aphorisms concerning 


the different forms oi ice water and vapour hence 
i have proposed to reject the term form in such cases 
and to speak of the different consistence of jy body in 
these conditions the term consistence is usually ap 
plied to conditions between solid and fluid and may 
without effort be extended to those limiting conditions 
and though it may appear more harsh toxtend the 
term consistence to the state of air it may be justified 
by what has been said in speaking of aphorism v 

i may notice another example of the necessity of 
avoiding ambiguous words a philosopher who makes 
method his study would naturally be termed a method 
ist but unluckily this word is already appropriated 
to a religious sect and hence we could hardly venture 
to speak of caealpinus ray morison rivintis tour 
nefort linnaeus and their successors as botanical me 
thodhts again by thife maxim we are almost debar 
red from using the term physician for a cultivator of 
the science of physics because it already signifies a 
practiser of physic we might perhaps still use phy 
sician as the equivalent of the french physicien in 
virtue of aphorism y but probably it would be bet 
ter to form a new word thus we may say that while 
the naturalist employs principally the ideas of resem 
blance and life the physicist proceeds upon the ideas 
of force matter and the properties of matter 

whatever may be thought of this proposal the 
maxim which it implies is frequently useful it is 
this 


aphorism yii 

it is better to form new words as technical terms than to 
employ old ones in which the last three aphorisms cannot be 
complied with 

the principal inconvenience attending the employ 
ment of new words constructed expressly for the use 
of science is the difficulty of effectually introducing 
them readers will not readily take the trouble to 
learn the meaning of a word in which the njempry js 


 hist ind sc b x c ii sect 



the language of science 

not assisted by some obvious suggestion connected with 
the common use of language when this difficulty is 
overcome the new word is better than one merely ap 
propriated since it is more secure from vagueness and 
confusion and in cases where the inconveniences 
belonging to a scientific use of common words become 
great and inevitable a new word must be framed and 
introduced 

the maxims which belong to the construction of 
such words will be stated hereafter but i may notice 
an instance or two tending to show the necessity of 
the maxim now before us 

the word force has been appropriated in the science 
of mechanics in two senses as indicating the cause of 
motion and again as expressing certain measures of 
the effects of this cause in the phrases accelerating 
force and moving force heilce we might have occa 
sion to speak of the accelerating or moving force of a 
certain force for instance if we were to say that the 
force which governs the motions of tlio planets resides 
in the sun and that the accelerating force othis force 
varies only with the distance but its moving force 
varies as the product of the mass of the sun and the 
planet this is a harsh and incongruous mode of ex 
pression and might have been avoided if instead of 
accelerating force and moving force single abstract 
fterms had been introduced by newton if for in 
stance he had said that the velocity generated in a 
second measures the accelerativity o£ the force which 
produces it and the momentum produced in a second 
measures the motivity of the force 

the science which treats of heat has hitherto had no 
special designation treatises upon it have generally 
been termed treatises on heat but this practice of 
employing the same term to denote the property and 
the science which treats of it is awkward and often 
ambiguous and it is further attended with this in 
convenience that we have no adjective derived from 
the name of the science as we have in other cases 
when wo speak of acoustical experiments and optical 
tljories this inconvenience lu led various persons 
to suggest names for the science of heat m comte 



 aphorisms concerning 

terms it thermolog y in the history of the sciences 
i have named it thermotics which appears to me to 
agree better with the analogy of the names of other 
corresponding sciences acoustics and optics 

electricity is in the ame condition as heat having 
only one word to express the property and the science 
m le comte proposes electrology for the same reason 
as bfore i should conceive electrics more agreeable to 
analogy the coincidence of the word with the plural 
of electric would not give rise to ambiguity for elec 
trics taken as the name of a science would be singular 
like optics and mechanics but a term offers itself to 
express common or machine electrics which appears 
worthy of admission though involving a theoretical 
view the received doctrine of the difference between 
voltaic and common electricity is that in the former 
case the fluid must bectnsidered as in motion in the 
latter as at rest the science which treats of the for 
mer class of subjects is cominonfy termed electrody 
namics which obviously suggests the name electro 
statics for the latter 

the subject of the tides is in like manner destitute 
of any name which designates the science concerned 
about it have ventured to employ tlie term tido 
logy having been much engaged in tidological re 
searches 

many persons possess a peculiarity o£ vision which 
disables them from distinguishing ’certain colours on 
examining many sucli cases we find that in all such 
persons the peculiarities are the same all of them 
confounding scarlet with green and pink with blue 
hence they form a class which for the convenience of 
physiologists and others ought to have a fixed desig 
nation instead of calling them as has usually been 
done i persons having a peculiarity of vision we might 
take a greek term implying this meaning and term 
them idiopts 

but my business at present is not to speak of the 
selection of new terms when they are introduced but 
to illustrate the maxim that the necessity for®thecr in 
troduction often arisen the construction of new terfiis 
will be treated of subsequently 



the language oe science 

aphorism viii 

terms m us t be constructed and appropriated so as to be 
fitted to enunciate simply and clearly true general pro 
positions 

tms aphorism may be considered as the fundamen 
tal principle and supreme rule of all scientific termi 
nology it is asserted by cuvier speaking of a par 
ticular case thus he says of gmelin that by placing 
the larnantin in the genus of morses and the siren in 
the genus of eels he had rendered every general pro 
position respecting the organization of those genera 
impossible 

the maxim is true of words appropriated as well 
as invented and applies equally to the mathematical 
chemical and classificatory sciences with regard to 
most of these and especially the two former classes it 
has been abundantly exemplified already in what has 
previously been said and in the history of the sciences 
for we have there had to notice many technical terms 
with the occasions of their introduction and all these 
occasions have involved the intention of expressing in 
a convenient manner pme truth or supposed truth 
the terms of astronomy were adopted for the purpose 
of stating and reasoning upon the relations of the ce 
lestial motions according to the doctrine of the sphere 
and the other laws which were discovered by astrono 
mers the few technical terms which belong to me 
chanics force velocity momentum inertia c were 
employed from the first with a view to the expression 
of the laws f motion and of rest and were in the 
end limited so as truly and simply to express those 
laws when they were fully ascertained in chemistry 
the term phlogiston was useful as has been shown in 
the history in classing together processes which really 
are of the same nature and the nomenclature of the 
oxygen theory was still preferable because it enabled 
the chemist to express a still greater number of gene 
ral ittutils 


 idgne animal introd viii

to the connexion here asserted of theory and no 
menclature we have the testimony of the author of 
the oxygen theory in the preface to his chemistry 
lavoisier says — ‘thus while i thought myself em 
ployed only in forming a nomenclature and while i 
proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the 
chemical language my work transformed itself by de 
grees without my being able to prevent it into a 
treatise on the elements of chemistry’ and he then 
proceeds to show how this happened 

it is however mainly through the progress of na 
tural history in modern times that philosophers have 
been led to see tle importance and necessity of new 
terms in expressing new truths thus harvey in the 
preface to his work on generation says — ‘ be not 
offended if in setting opt the history of the egg i 
make use of a new method and sometimes of unusual 
terms for as they which find out a new plantation 
and new shores call them by names of their own coin 
ing which posterity afterwards accepts and receives 
so those that find out new secrets have good title to 
tlieir compellation and here metkinks i hear galen 
advising if we consent in the things contend not 
about the words’ 

the nomenclature which answers the purposes of 
natural history is a systematic nomenclature apef 
will be further considered under the next aphorism 
but we may remark that the aphorism now before 
us governs the use of words not in science only but 
in common language also are we to apply the name 
jlsh to animals of the whale kind the answer is de 
termined by our present rule we are to do so or not 
accordingly as we can best express true propositions 
if we are speaking of the internal structure and phy 
siology of the animal we must not call them fish for 
in these respects they deviate widely from fishes they 
have warm blood and produce and suckle their young 
as land quadrupeds do but this would not prevent 
our speaking of the iuhalefishery and calling such ani 
mals fish on all occasions connected with this employ 
ment for the relation thus arising depend upon the 
animal’s living in the water and being caught in a 



the language of science j 

manner similar to other fishes a plea that human 
laws which mention fish do not apply to whales would 
be rejected at once by an intelligent judge 

a bituminiferous deposit which occurs amongst the 
coal measures in the neighbourhood of edinburgh was 
used as coal and called ‘ boghead cannel coal’ but 
a lawsuit arose upon the question whether this which 
 geologically was not the coal should be regarded in 
law as coal the opinions of chemists and geologists 
as well as of lawyers were discrepant and a direct 
decision of the case was evaded 


aphorism ix 

• 

in the classijicatory sciences a systematic nomencla 
ture is necessary and the system and the nomenclature are 
each essential to the utility of the other 

the inconveniences arising from the want of a good 
nomenclature were long felt in botany and are still 
felt in mineralogy the attempts to remedy them by 
synonymies are very ineffective for such comparisons of 
synonyms do not supply a systematic nomenclature 
and such a one alone can enable us to state general 
truths respecting the objects of which the classificatory 
sciences treat the system and the names ought to 
be introduced together for the former is a collec 
tion of asserted analogies and resemblances for which 
the latter provide simple and permanent expressions 
hence it has repeatedly occurred in the progress of 
natural history that good systems did not take root 
or produce any lasting effect among naturalists because 
they were not accompanied by a corresponding no 
menclature in this way as we have already noticed 
the excellent botanical system of csesalpinus was 
without immediate effect upon the science the work 
of willughby as cuvier says forms an epoch and 


 miller’s chemistry iii 


 hist dcs pissons prcf 



 aphorisms concerning 

a happy epoch in ichthyology yet because willughby 
had no nomenclature of his own and no fixed names 
for his genera his immediate influence was pot great 
again in speaking of schlotheim’s work containing 
representations of fossil vegetables m adolphe bron 
gniart observes that the figures and descriptions are 
so good that if the author had established a nomen 
clature for the objects he describes his work would 
have become the basis of all succeeding labours on 
the subject 

as additional examples of cases in which the im 
provement of classification in recent times has led 
philosophers to propose new names i may mention 
the term pcecilitel proposed by mr conybeare to de 
signate the group of strata which lies below the oolites 
and lias including the new red or variegated sand 
stone with the keuper dbove and the magnesian lime 
stone below it again the transition districts of our 
island have recently been reduced to system by pro 
fessor sedgwick and mr murchison and this step has 
been marked by the terms cambrian system and 
silurian system applied to the two great groups of 
formations which they have respectively examined 
and by several other names of the subordinate mem 
bers of these formations 

thus system and nomenclature are each essential 
to the other without nomenclature the system is 
not permanently incorporated into the general body of 
knowledge and made an instrumept of future progress 
without system the names cannot express general 
truths and contain no reason why they should be em 
ployed in preference to any other names 

this has been generally acknowledged by the most 
philosophical naturalists of modern times thus lin 
naeus begins that part of his botanical philosophy in 
which names are treated of by stating that the founda 
tion of botany is twofold disposition and denomina 
tion and he adds this latin line 

nomina si fiescis perit et cognitio rerum 


 prodrom veg foss p 



the language of science 

and cuvier in the preface to his animal kingdom 
explains in a very striking manner how the attempt 
to connect zoology with anatomy led him at the same 
time to reform the classifications and to correct the 
 nomenclature of preceding zoologists 

i have stated that in mineralogy we are still desti 
tute of a good nomenclature generally current from 
•what has now been said it will be seen that it may 
be very far from easy to supply this defect since wo 
have as yet no generally received system of mineralo 
gical classification till we know what are really 
different species of minerals and in what larger 
groups these species can be arrange so as to have 
common properties we shall never obtaiij a permanent 
mineralogical nomenclature thus leucocyclite and 
tesselite are minerals previously confounded with 
apophyllite which sir john herschel and sir david 
brewster distinguished by those names in consequence 
of certain optical properties which they exhibit but 
are these properties definite distinctions and are 
there any external differences corresponding to them 
if not can we consider them as separate species and 
if not separate species ought they to have separate 
names in like manner we might ask if augite and 
hornblende are really the same species as gustavus 
ito§e has maintained if dialing c and hyper athene are 
not definitely distinguished which has been asserted 
by kobell till such questions are settled we can 
not have a fixed nomenclature in mineralogy what 
appears the best course to follow in the present state 
of the science i shall consider when we come to speak 
of the form of technical terms 

i may however notice here that the main forms 
of systematic nomenclature are two — terms which 
are produced by combining words of higher and lower 
generality as the binary names consisting of the name 
of the genus and the species generally praployed by 
natural historians since the time of linnams — and 
terms in which some relation of things is indicated by 
a change in the form of the word for example an 
alteration of its termination of whifch kind of nomen 
nov obg

aphorism x 

new terms and changes of terms which are not needed in 
order to express truth are to be avoided 

as the seventh aphorism asserted that novelties 
in language may be and ought to be introduced when 
they aid the enunciation of truths w now declare 
that they are not admissible in any other case new 
terms and new systems of terms are not to be intro 
duced for example in virtue of their own neatness or 
symmetry or other merits if there is no occasion for 
their use 

i may mention asn old example of a superfluous 
attempt of this kind an occurrence in the history of 
astronomy in john bayer and julius schiller 
devised a ccelum christianum in which the common 
names of the planets c were replaced by those of 
adam moses and the patriarchs the twelve signs 
became the twelve apostles and the constellations 
became sacred places and things peireskius who had 
to pronounce upon the value of this proposal praised 
the piety of the inventors but did not approve he 
said the design of perverting and confounding what 
ever of celestial information from the period of the 
earliest memory is found in books 

nor are slight anomalies in the existing language of 
science sufficient ground for a change if they do not 
seriously interfere with the expression of our know 
ledge thus linnaeus says that a fair generic name 
is not to be exchanged for another though apter one 
and if wo separate an old genus into several we 
must try to find names for them among the synonyms 
which describe the old genus this maxim excludes 
the restoration of ancient names long disused no less 
than the needless invention of new ones linnaeus

lays down this rule and adds that the botanists of 
the sixteenth century well nigh ruined botany by their 
anxiety tc recover the ancient names of plants in 
like manner cuvier laments it as a misfortune that 
he has had to introduce many new names and declares 
earnestly that he has taken great pains to preserve 
those of his predecessors 

• the great bulk which the synonymy of botany and 
of mineralogy have attained shows us that this maxim 
has not been universally attended to in these cases 
however the multiplication of different names for the 
same kind of object has arisen in general from ignor 
ance of the identity of it under different circumstances 
or from the want of a system which might assign to 
it its proper place but there are other instances in 
which the multiplication of names has arisen not from 
defect but from excess of the spirit of system the 
love which speculative men bear towards symmetry 
and completeness is constantly at work to make them 
create systems of classification more regular and more 
perfect than can be verified by the facts and as good 
systems are closely connected with a good nomencla 
ture systems thus erroneous and superfluous lead to 
a nomenclature which is prejudicial to science for 
although such a nomenclature is finally expelled when 
it is found not to aid us in expressing the true laws 
of nature it may obtain some temporary sway during 
which and even afterwards it may be a source of 
much confusion • 

we have a conspicuous example of such a result in 
the geological nomenclature of werner and his school 
thus it was assumed in werner’s system that his 
first second and third flotz limestone his old and 
new red sandstone were universal formations and 
geologists looked upon it as their business to detect 
these strata in other countries names were thus 
assigned to the rocks of various parts of europe which 
created immense perplexity before they were agin 
ejected the geological terms which now prevail for

instance those of smith are for the most part not 
systematic but are borrowed from accidents as locali

on a change of system on the other hand we do not 
find sufficient reason to accept the system of names of

to the geology of england and wales according t 
which the carboniferous rocks are the medial order 
— having above them the super medial order new red 
sand oolites and chalk and above these the supe

below the submedial order the transition rocks

does not appear that they arc useful in enunciating 
geological truths wo may it would seem pronounce 
the same judgment respecting the system of geological 
names proposed by m alexander brongniart in his

he divides these strata into nine classes which he 
terms terrains alluvions lysiens pyrogenes clys 
miens yzemiens ilemilysiens agalysiens plutoniques

vided thus the terrains yzemiens are thalassiques 
pelagiqnes and abyssiques and the abyssiques are 
subdivided into lias keuper conchiliens poeciliens 
peneens rudimentaires entritiques ifouillers carbo 
nifers and greh rouge ancien scarcely any amount 
of new truths would induce geologists to burthen 
themselves at once with this enormous system of new 
names but in fact it is evident that any portion of 
truth which any author can have brought to light 
may be conveyed by means of a much simpler appara 
tus such a nomenclature carries its condemnation 
on its own face 

nearly the same may be said of the systematic no 
menclature proposed for mineralogy by professor mohs 
even if all his oenera be really natural groups a doc 
trine which we can have no confidence in till they are 
confirmed by the evidence of chemistry there is no 



the language of science 

necessity to make so great a cliange in the received 
names of minerals his proceeding in this respect so 
different frjpm the temperance of linnams and cuvier 
has probably ensured a speedy oblivion to this part of 
his system in crystallography on the other hand in 
which mohs’s improvements have been very valuable 
there are several terms introduced by him as rhombo 
itedron scalenohedron hemihedral systems of crystalli 
zation which will probably be a permanent portion of 
the language of science 

i may remark in general that the only persons who 
succeed in making great alterations in the language of 
science are not those who make nairns arbitrarily and 
as an exercise of ingenuity but those wljo have much 
new knowledge to communicate so that the vehicle is 
commended to general reception by the value of what 
it contains it is only eminent discoverers to whom 
the authority is conceded of introducing a new system 
of names just as it is only the highest authority in the 
state which has the power ot putting a new coinage in 
circulation 

i will here quote some judicious remarks of mi 
howard which fall partly under this aphorism and 
partly under some which follow he had proposed as 
names for the kinds of clouds the following cirrus 
cirjrocumulus cirrostratus cumulostratus cumulus 
nimbus stratus in an abridgment of his views given 
in the supplement to the encydojwedia britannica en 
glish names were proposed as the equivalents of these 
curlcloud sondercloud wanecloud twaincloud stack 
encloud raincloud fallcloud upon these mr how 
ard observes ‘ mention these in order to have the 
opportunity of saying that i do not adopt them the 
names for the clouds which i deduced from the latin 
are but seven in number and very easy to remember 
they were intended as arbitrary terms for the structure 
of clouds and the meaning of them was carefully fixed 
by a definition the observer having once made him 
self master of this was able to apjfly the term with 
correctness after a little experience to the subject 
under all its varieties of form coloifr or position the

new names if meant to be another set of arbitrary 
terms are superfluous if intended to convey in them 
selves an explanation in english they fail °n thi by 
applying to some part or circumstance only of the defi 
nition the whole of which must be kept in view to 
study the subject with success to take for an ex 
ample the first of the modifications the term cirrus 
very readily takes an abstract meaning equally applb 
cable to the rectilinear as to the flexuous forms of the 
subject but the name of curlcloud will not without 
some violence to its obvious sense acquire this more 
extensive one and will therefore be apt to mislead the 
reader rather than further his progress others of 
these names are as devoid of a meaning obvious to the 
english reader as the latin terms themselves but 
the principal objection to english or any other local 
terms remains to be stated they take away from 
the nomenclature its general advantage of constitut 
ing as far as it goes an universal language by means 
of which the intelligent of eveiy country may convey 
to each other their ideas without the necessity of 
translation’ 

i here adduce these as examples of the arguments 
against changing an established nomenclature as 
grounds of selecting a new one they may be taken 
into account hereafter 


aphorism xi 

terms which imply theoretical views are admissible as 
far as the theory is proved 

it is not unfrequently stated that the circumstances 
from which the names employed in science borrow their 
meaning ought to be facts and not theories but such 
a recommendation implies a belief that facts are rigor 
ously distinguished from theories and directly opposed 
to them which belief we have repeatedly seen is un 
founded when theories are firmly established they 
become facts and names founded on such theoretical 
views are unexceptionable if we speak of the minor 



the language oe science 


 

axis of jupiter’s orbit or of his density or of the angle 
of refraction or the length of an undulation of red 
liglgb we assume certain theories but inasmuch as the 
theories are no’sy the inevitable interpretation of ascer 
tained facts we can have no better terms to designate 
the conceptions thus referred to and hence the rule 
which wo must follow is not that our terms must 
•involve no theory but that they imply the theory only 
in that sense in which it is the interpretation of the 
facts 

for example the term polarization of light was ob 
jected to as involving a theory perhaps the term 
was at first suggested by conceiving light to consist of 
particles having poles turned in a particular manner 
but among intelligent speculators the notion of polar 
ization soon reduced itself to the simple conception of 
opposite properties in opposite positions which is a bare 
statement of the fact and the term being understood 
to have this meaning is a perfectly good term and 
indeed the best which we can imagine for designating 
what is intended 

i need hardly add the caution that names involving 
theoretical views not in accordance with facts are to be 
rejected the following instances exemplify both the 
positive and the negative application of this maxim 

 the distinction of primary and secondary rocks in 
geology was founded upon a theory namely that those 
which do not contain any organic remains were first 
deposited and afterwards those whifch contain plants 
and animals but this theory was insecure from the 
first the difficulty of making the separation which 
it implied led to the introduction of a class of transition 
rocks and the recent researches of geologists lead 
them to the conclusion that those rocks which are 
termed primary may be the newest not the oldest 
productions of nature 

in order to avoid this incongruity other terms have 
been proposed as substitutes for these’ sir c lyell 
remarks that granite gneiss and the like form a class

which should be designated by a common name which 
name should not be of chronological import he pro 
poses hypogene signifying ‘ n etherformed r and jius 
he adopts the theory that they have not assumed their 
present form and structure at the surface but deter 
mines nothing of the period when they were produced 

these hypogene rocks again he divides into unstra 
tified or platonic and altered stratified or metamorpliic 
the latter term implying the hypothesis that the strati 
fied rocks to which it is applied have been altered by 
the effect of fire or otherwise since they were deposited 
that fossiliferous strata in some cases at least have 
undergone such a change is demonstrable from facts 

the modern nomenclature of chemistry implies the 
oxygen theory of chemistry hence it has sometimes 
been objected to thus davy in sjeaking of the 
lavoisierian nomenclature makes the following re 
marks which however plausible they may sound will 
be found to be utterly erroneous ‘ simplicity and preci 
sion ought to be the characteristics of a scientific nomen 
clature words should signify things or the analogies of 
things and not opinions a substance in one age sup 
posed to be simple in another is proved to be compound 
and vice versd a theoretical nomenclature is liable 
to continual alterations oxygenated muriatic acid is 
as improper a term as dephlogisticated marine acid 
every school believes itself to be in the right and if 
every school assumes to itself the liberty of altering 
the names of chemical substances in consequence of 
new ideas of their composition there can be no perma 
nency in the language of the science it must always 
be confused and uncertain bodies which are similar 
to each other should always be classed together and 
there is a presumption that their composition is ana 
logous metals earths alkalis are appropriate names 
for the bodies they represent and independent of all 
speculation whereas oxides sulphurets and muriates 
are telms founded upon opinions of the composition of 
bodies some of wlmh have been already found erroneous 


fl elcm geol p

the language of science 


 


the least dangerois mode of giving a systematic form 
to a language seems to be to signify the analogies of 
substances by some common sign affixed to the begin 
ning or lie termination of the word thus as the 
metals have been distinguished by a termination in 
um as aurum so their calciform or oxidated state 
might have been denoted by a termination in a as 
aura and no progress however great in the science 
could render it necessary that such a mode of appella 
tion should be changed’ 

these remarks are founded upon distinctions which 
have no real existence we cannot separate things 
from their properties nor can we consider their pro 
perties and analogies in any other way than by having 
opinions about them by contrasting analogies with 
opinions it might appear as if the author maintained 
that there were certain analogies about which there 
was no room for erroneous opinions yet the analo 
gies of chemical compounds are in fact those points 
which have been most the subject of difference of opi 
nion and on which the revolutions of theories have 
most changed men’s views as an example of analo 
gies which are still recognized under alterations of 
theory the writer gives the relation of a metal to its 
oxide or calciform state but this analogy of metallic 
oxides as bed copper or iron ore to calx or burnt 
liitie is very far from being selfevident — so far in 
deed that the recognition of the analogy was a great 
step in chemical theory the term which he quotes 
oxygenated muriatic acid and the same may be said of 
dephlogisticated marine acid if improper are so not 
because they involve theory but because they involve 
false theory — not because those who framed them did 
not endeavour to express analogies but because they 
expressed analogies about which they were mistaken 
unconnected names as metals earths alkalis are good 
as the basis of a systematic nomenclature but they 
are not substitutes for such a nomenclature a sys 
tematic nomenclature is an instrument of great utility 
and power as the modern history of chemistry has 
shown it would be highly un philosophical to reject 



 aphorisms concerning 

the use of such an instrument because in the course 
of the revolutions of science we may have to modify 
or even to remodel it altogether its utility is not by 
that means destroyed it has retained transmitted 
and enabled us to reason upon the doctrines of ths 
earlier theory so far as they are true and when this 
theory is absorbed into a more comprehensive one for 
this and not its refutation is the end of a theory so 
far as it is true the nomenclature is easily translated 
into that which the new theory introduces we have 
seen in the history of astronomy how valuable the 
theory of epicycles was in its time the nomenclature 
of the relations of a planet’s orbit which that theory 
introduced was one of keplers resources in discover 
ing the elliptical theory and though now superseded 
is still readily intelligible to astronomers 

this is not the place fco discuss the reasons for the 
form of scientific terms otherwise we might ask in 
reference to the objections to the lavoisierian nomen 
clature if such forms as aurum and aura are good to 
represent the absence or presence of oxygen why such 
forms as sulphite and sulphate are not equally good to 
represent the presence of what we may call a smaller 
or larger dose of oxygen so long as the oxygen theory 
is admitted in its present form and to indicate still 
the difference of the same substances if under any 
change of theory it should come to be interpreted in a 
new manner 

but i do not now dwell upon such arguments my 
object in this place being to show that terms involving 
theory are not only allowable if understood so far as 
the theory is proved but of great value and indeed of 
indispensable use in science the objection to them is 
inconsistent with the objects of science if after all 
that has been done in chemistry or any other science 
we have arrived at no solid knowledge no permanent 
truth — if all that we believe now may be proved to 
be false tomorrow — then indeed our opinions and 
theories are corruptible elements on which it would 
be unwise to rest any thing important and which we 
might wish to exclude even from our names but if 



the language of science 

our knowledge has no more secuty than this we can 
find no reason why we should wish at all to have names 
of things since the names are needed mainly that we 
may reason upon and increase our knowledge such as 
it is if we are condemned to endless alternations of 
varying opinions then no doubt our theoretical terms 
may be a source of confusion but then where would 
be the advantage of their being otherwise what would 
be the value of words which should express in a more 
precise manner opinions equally fleeting it will per 
haps be said our terms must express facts not theo 
ries but of this distinction so applied we have repeat 
edly shown the futility theories firmly established 
are facts is it not a fact that the rusting of iron 
arises from the metal combining with the cscygen of 
the atmosphere is it not a fact that a combination 
of oxygen and hydrogen produces water that our 
terms should express such facts is precisely what we 
are here inculcating 

our examination of the history of science has led us 
to a view very different from that which represents it 
as consisting in the succession of hostile opinions it 
is on the contrary a progress in which each step is 
recognized and employed in the succeeding one every 
theory so far as it is true and all that have prevailed 
extensively and long contain a large portion of truth 
is token up into the theory which succeeds and seems 
to expel it all the narrower inductions of the first 
are included in the more comprehensive generalizations 
of the second and this is performed mainly by means 
of such terms as we are now considering — terms in 
volving the previous theory it is by means of such 
terms that the truths at first ascertained become so 
familiar and manageable that they can be employed as 
elementary facts in the formation of higher inductions 

these principles must be applied also though with 
great caution and in a temperate manner even to de 
scriptive language thus the mode of describing the 
forms of crystals adopted by w eroer and rome de l’lsle 
was to ’consider an original orm from which other 
lorms are derived by truncations of the edges and the 



 


aphorisms concerning 


angles haiiy’s metllod of describing tlie same forms 
was to consider them as built up of rows of small 
solids the angles being determined by the decrements 
of these rows both these methods of description in 
volve hypothetical views and the last was intended to 
rest on a true physical theory of the constitution of 
crystals both hypotheses are doubtful or false yet 
both these methods are good as modes of description 
nor is haiiy’s terminology vitiated if we suppose as 
in fact we must suppose in many instances that crys 
talline bodies are not really made up of such small 
solids the mode of describing an octahedron of fiuor 
spar as derived from the cube by decrements of one 
row on all the edges would still be proper and useful 
as a description whatever judgment we should form of 
the material structure of the body but then we must 
consider the solids wliicliare thus introduced into the 
description as merely hypothetical geometrical forms 
serving to determine the angles of the faces it is in 
this way alone that haiiy’s nomenclature can now be 
retained 

in like manner we may admit theoretical views into 
the descriptive phraseology of other parts of natural 
history and the theoretical terms will replace the 
obvious images in proportion as the theory is gene 
rally accepted and familiarly applied for example in 
speaking of the honeysuckle we may say that tlie 
upper leaves are perfoliate meaning that a single 
round leaf is perforated by the stalk or threaded upon 
it here is an image which sufficiently conveys the 
notion of the form but it is now generally recognized 
that this apparent single leaf is in fact two opposite 
leaves joined together at their bases if this were doubt 
ed it may be proved by comparing the upper leaves 
with the lower which are really separate and opposite 
hence the term connate is applied to these conjoined 
opposite leaves implying that they grow together or 
they are called connatoperfoliate again formerly 
the corolla was called monopetalous or polypetalous as 
it consisted of one part or of several but it is novf 
agreed among botanists that those corollas which ap 



tiie language oe science 


 


pear to consist of single part jfre in fact composed 
of several soldered together hence the term gamope 
talous isnow employed by de candolle and his follow 
ers instead of monopetalons 

in this way the language of natural history not 
only expresses but inevitably implies general laws of 
nature and words are thus fitted to aid the progress 
of knowledge in this as in other provinces of science 

aphorism xii 

if terms are systematically goody they are not to be re 

jected because they are etymologically inaccurate 

 

terms belonging to a system are defined not by the 
meaning of their radical words but by their place in 
the system that they should be appropriate in their 
signification aids the processes of introducing and re 
membering them and should therefore be carefully 
attended to by those who invent and establish them 
but this once done no objections founded upon their 
etymological import are of any material weight we 
find no inconvenience in the circumstance that geome 
try means the measuring of the earth that the name 
porphyry is applied to many rocks which have no fiery 
spots as the word implies and oolite to strata which 
•hive no roelike structure i like manner if the term 
paicilite were already generally received as the name 
of a certain group of strata it would be no valid 
ground for quarrelling with it that this group was not 
always variegated in colour or that other groups were 
equally variegated although undoubtedly in intro 
ducing such a term care should be taken to make it 
as distinctive as possible it often happens as wc have 
seen that by the natural progress of changes in lan 
guage a word is steadily confirmed in a sense quite 
different from its etymological import but though

aphorisms concerning 


we may accept such instances we must not wantonly 
attempt to imitate them i say not wantonly for if 
the progress of scientific identification compel us to 
follow any class of objects into circumstances where 
the derivation of the term is inapplicable we may still 
consider the term as an unmeaning sound or rather 
an historical symbol expressing a certain member of 
our system thus if in following the course of the 
mountain or carboniferous limestone we find that in 
ireland it does not form mountains nor contain coal 
we should act unwisely in breaking down the nomen 
clature in which our systematic relations are already 
expressed in order to gain in a particular case a pro 
priety of language which has no scientific value 

all attempts to act upon the maxim opposite to 
this and to make our scientific names properly de 
scriptive of the objects hhve failed and must fail for 
the marks which really distinguish the natural classes 
of objects are by no means obvious the discovery of 
them is one of the most important steps in science 
and when they are discovered they are constantly 
liable to exceptions because they do not contain the 
essential differences of the classes the natural order 
umbellatce in order to be a natural order must con 
tain some plants which have not umbels as eryngium 
‘in such cases’ said linnseus ‘it is of small import 
what you call the order if you take a proper series 
of plants and give it some name which is clearly un 
derstood to apply to the plants you have associated’ 
‘i have’ he adds ‘followed the rule of borrowing the 
name a fortiori from the principal feature’ 

the distinction of crystals into systems according to 
the degree of symmetry which obtains in them has 
been explained elsewhere two of these systems of 
which the relation as to symmetry might be expressed 
by saying that one is square •pyramidal and the other 
oblong pyramidal or the first square prismatic and the 
second oblong prismatic are termed by mohs the first 
pyramidal and the second prismatic and it may

be doubted whether it is wortli tliile to invent other 
terms though these are thus defective in characteristic 
significance as an example of a needless rejection of 
old terrhl in virtue of a supposed impropriety in their 
meaning i may mention the attempt made in the last 
edition of haiiy’s mineralogy to substitute autopside 
and heteropside for metallic and unmetallic it was 
supposed to be proved that all bodies have a metal for 
their basis and hence it was wished to avoid the term 
unmetallic but the words metallic and unmetallic 
may mean that minerals seem metallic and unmetallic 
just as well as if they contained the element opside to 
imply this seeming the old names express all that 
the new express and with more simplicity and there 
fore should nut be disturbed 

the maxim on which we are now insisting that we 
are not to be too scrupulous about the etymology of 
scientific terms may at first sight appear to be at 
variance with our fourth aphorism that words used 
technically are to retain their common meaning as far 
as possible but it must be recollected that in the 
fourth aphorism we spoke of common words appro 
priated as technical terms we here speak of words 
constructed for scientific purposes and although it is 
perhaps impossible to draw a broad line between these 
two classes of terms still the rule of propriety may be 
thted thus in technical terms deviations from the 
usual meaning of words are bad in proportion as the 
words are more familiar in our owi language thus 
we may apply the term cirrus to a cloud composed of 
filaments even if these filaments are straight but to 
call such a cloud a curl cloud would be much more 
harsh 

since the names of tilings and of classes of things 
when constructed so as to involve a description are 
constantly liable to become bad the natural classes 
shifting away from the descriptive marks thus prema 
turely and casually adopted i venture to lay down 
the following maxim 



 aphorisms concerning 

aphorism xiii 

the fundamental terms of a system of nomenclature mtiy 
he conveniently borrowed from casual or arbitrary circum 
stances 

for instance the names of plants of minerals and 
of geological strata may be taken from the places 
where they occur conspicuously or in a distinct form 
as parietaria parnassia chalcedony arragonite si 
lurian system purbeck limestone these names may 
be considered as at first supplying standards of refer 
ence for in order to ascertain whether any rock be 
purbeck limestone we might compare it with the 
rocks in the i she of purbeck but this reference to a 
local standard is of authority only till the place of the 
object in the system and’ its distinctive marks are as 
certained it would not vitiate the above names if it 
were found that the parnassia does not grow on par 
nassus that chalcedony is not found in chalcedon or 
even that arragonite no longer occurs in arragon for 
it is now firmly established as a mineral species even 
in geology such a reference is arbitrary and may be 
superseded or at least modified by a more systematic 
determination a lpine limestone is no longer accepted 
as a satisfactory designation of a rock now that we 
know the limestone of the alps to be of various ages 

again names of persons either casually connected 
with the object or arbitrarily applied to it may be 
employed as designations this has been done most 
copiously in botany as for example nicotiana dahlia 
fuchsia j ungerjnannia lonicera and limneus has 
laid down rules for restricting this mode of perpetu 
ating the memory of men in the names of plants 
those generic names he says which have been con 
structed to preserve the memory of persons who have 
deserved well of botany are to be religiously retained 
this ho adds is the sole and supreme reward of the 
botanist’s labours and must be carefully guarded and

scrupulously bestowed as an endburagement and an 
honour still more arbitrary are the terms borrowed 
from thejiames of the gods and goddesses heroes and 
heroines of antiquity to designate new genera in those 
departments natural history in which so many have 
been discovered in recent times as to wery out all at 
tempts at descriptive nomenclature cuvier has coun 
tenanced this method have had to frame many 
new names of genera and subgenera he says ‘for 
the subgenera which i have established were so nu 
merous and various that the memory is not satisfied 
with numerical indications these i have chosen 
either so as to indicate some character or among the 
usual denominations which i have latinized or finally 
after the example of linnseus among the mmes of 
mythology which are in general agreeable to the ear 
and which are far from being exhausted’ 

this mode of framing names from the names of per 
sons to whom it was intended to do honour has been 
employed also in the mathematical tmd chemical sci 
ences but such names have rarely obtained any per 
manence except when they recorded an inventor or 
discoverer some of the constellations indeed have 
retained such appellations as berenices hair and the 
new star which shone out in the time of caesar would 
probably have retained the name given to it of the 
julian star if it had not disappeared again soon after 
in the map of the moon almost all the parts have 
had such names imposed upon them by those who 
have constructed such maps and these names have 
very properly been retained but the names of new 
planets and satellites thus suggested have not been 
generally accepted as the medicean stars the name 
employed by galileo for the satellites of j upiter the 
georgium sidus the appellation proposed by herschel 
for uranus when first discovered ceres ferdinandea

to be periodical have very properly had assigned to 
them the name of the person who established this 
point and of these we have thus halleys ended s 
comet and bielas or gambarts comet 

in the case of discoveries in science or inventions of 
apparatus the name of the inventor is very properly 
employed as the designation thus we have the tor

aphorism xiy 

the binary method of nomenclature names by genus 
and species is the most convenient hitherto employed in 
classification 

the number of species iii every province of natural 
history is so vast that we cannot distinguish them 
and record the distinctions without some artifice the 
known species of plants for instance were in the 
time of linnaeus and are now probably it 
would be useless to endeavour to frame and employ 
separate names for each of these species 

the division of the objects into a subordinated sys 
tem of classification enables us to introduce a nomen 
clature which does not require this normous number 
of names the artifice employed is to name a specimen 
by means of two or it might be more steps of the suc 
cessive division thus in botany each of the genera 
has its name and the species are marked by the addi 
tion of some epithet to the name of the genus in this 
manner about generic names with a moderate 
number of specific names were found by linnaeus 
sufficient to designate with precision all the species of 
vegetables known at his time and this binary me 
thod of nomenclature has been fcfund so convenient 
tipt it has been universally adopted in every other de 
partment of the natural historf of organized beings 



aphorisms concerning 


 

many other modes of nomenclature have been tried 
hut no other has at all taken root linnseus himself 
appears at first to have intended marking eaqh species 
by the generic name accompanied by characteristic 
descriptive phrase and to have proposed the employ 
ment of a trivial specific name as he termed it only 
as a method of occasional convenience the use of 
these trivial names however has become universal as 
we have said and is by many persons considered the 
greatest improvement introduced at the linnsean re 
form 


aphorism xy 

the maxims qf linnceus concerning the names to be used 
in botany philosophia botanica nomina sections 
to are good examples of aphorisms on this subject 

both linnaeus and other writers as adanson have 
given many maxims with a view of regulating the 
selection of generic and specific names the maxims 
of linnaeus were intended as much as possible to ex 
clude barbarism and confusion and have upon the 
whole been generally adopted • 

these canons and the sagacious modesty of great 
botanists like bobert brown in conforming to them 
have kept the majority of good botanists within salu 
tary limits though many of these canons were ob 
jected to by the contemporaries of linnaeus adanson 
and others as capricious and unnecessary restrictions 

many of the names introduced by linnaeus certainly 
appear fanciful enough thus he gives the name bau 
hinia to a plant which has leaves in pairs because the 
bauhins were a pair of brothers banisteria is the 
name of a climbing plant in honour of banister who 
travelled among mountains but such names once 
established by adequate authority lose all their incon 
venience and easily become permanent and hence the 
reasonableness of one of the linnsean rules — 

that as such a perpetuation of the names of persons

the language of science 

by the names of plants is the onl honour that botan 
ists have to bestow it ought to be used with care and 
caution nd religiously respected 

rd ed jt may serve to show how sensitive bo 
tanists are to the allusions contained in such names 
that it has been charged against linnaeus as a proof 
of malignity towards buffon that he changed the name 
of the genus buffonia established by sauvages into 
bwfonia which suggested a derivation from bufo a 
toad it appears to be proved that the spelling was not 
linnaeus’s doing 

another linnoean maxim is art that the gene 
ric name must be fixed before we attempt to form a 
specific name the latter withoutthe former is like 
the clapper without the bell’ 

the name of the genus being fixed the species may 
be marked art by adding to it ‘a single word 
taken at will from any quarter’ that is it need not 
involve a description or any essential property of the 
plant but may be a casual or arbitrary appellation 
thus the various species of hwracium are hieradum 
alpinum ii ilalleri h pilosella ii dubium h 
murorum fcc where we see how different may be the 
kind of origin of the words 

attempts have been made at various times to form 
„ the names of species from those of genera in some more 
symmetrical manner but these have not been suc 
cessful nor are they likely to be so and we shall venture 
to propound an axiom in condemnation of such names 

aphorism xvi 

numerical names in classification are bad and the same 
may be said of other names of kinds depending upon any 
fixed series of notes of order 

with regard to numerical names of kinds of species 
for instance the objections are of this nature besides 
that such names offer nothing for the imagination to 
take hold of new discoveries vill probably alter the 


 hooker fi sol 




aphorisms concerning 


 

numeration and male the names erroneous thus if 
we call the species of a genus a new species 
intermediate between and and fcc cannot be 
put in its place without damaging the lyimbers 

the geological term trias lately introduced to de 
signate the group consisting of the three members 
bunter sandstein muschelkalk and keuper becomes 
improper if as some geologists hold two of these mem 
bers cannot be separated 

objections resembling those which apply to numeri 
cal designations of species apply to other cases of fixed 
series for instance when it has been proposed to mark 
the species by altering the termination of the genus 
thus adanson demoting a genus by the name forma 
 lychnidea conceived he might mark five of its species 
by altering the last syllable forma fonnae fonnai 
fonnao fonnau then f others by fonnaba fonna 
ka and so on this would be liable to the same evils 
which have been noticed as belonging to the numerical 
method 


aphorism xyii 

in any classificatory science names including more than 
two steps of the classification may be employed if it be found 
convenient 

linnjsus in his canons for botanical nomenclature 
art says that the names of the class and the 
order are to be mute while the names of the genus 
and species are sonorous and accordingly the names

 in like manner the names assigned 

by mr rickman to the successive 

styles of gothic architecture in eng

by numerical designations first 
pointed second pointed third point

distinctly establishes classes has the 
right of naming them and that mr 
rickman’s names are really appro 


priate and significant— these new 
names would confound all meaning 
of language we should not be able 
to divide early english or deco 
rated or perpendicular into sub 
styles for who could talk of first 
second pointed and second second 
pointed and what should we call 
that pointed style— the transition 
from the norman— which precedes 
the first pointed

of plants and the same is true of animals have in com 
mon practice been binary only consisting of a generic 
and a specific name the class and the order have not 
been admitted to form part of the appellation of the 
species indeed it is easy to see that a name which 
must be identical in so many instances as that of an 
order would be would be felt as superfluous and bur 
thensome accordingly linn reus makes it one of his 
maxims that the name of the class and order must not 
be expressed but understood and hence he says boyen 
who took lilium for the name of a class rightly re 
jected this word as a generic name and substituted 
liriurn with the greek termination 

yet we must not too peremptorily assume such 
maxims as these to be universal for all clasificatory 
sciences it is very possible that it may be found ad 
visable to use three terms tlm of order genus and 
species in designating minerals as is done in mohs’s 
nomenclature for example ehombohedral calc halo 
ide t paratomous hal baryte 

it is possible also that it may be found useful in the 
same science mineralogy to mark some of the steps of 
classification by the termination thus it has been pro 
posed to confine the termination ite to the order fili 
cides of jstaumann as apopliylkte stilbifo leu cite fee 
and to use names of different form in other orders as 
vale spar for brennerite pyramidal titanium oxide 
for octahedrite some such method appears to be the 
most likely to give us a tolerable mineralogical nomen 
clature 


aphorism xyiii 

in forming a terminology words may be invented when 
necessary but they cannot be conveniently borrowed from 
casual or arbitrary circumstances

aphorisms concerning 


of names of the objects themselvas the names as 
was stated in the last maxim may be arbitrary but 
the descriptive terms must be borrowed from f words of 
suitable meaning in the modern or the classical lan 
guages thus the whole terminology which linnaeus 
introduced into botany is founded upon the received 
use of latin words although he defined their meaning 
so as to make it precise when it was not so according 
to aphorism v but many of the terms were invent 
ed by him and other botanists as perianth nectary 
pericarp so many indeed as to form along with the 
others a considerable language many of the terms 
which are now become familiar were originally in 
vented by writers on botany thus the word petal 
for one r division of the corolla was introduced by 
fabius columna the term sepal was devised by 
neckar to express each of the divisions of the calyx 
and up to the most recent times new denominations 
of parts and conditions of parts have been devised by 
botanists when they found them necessary in order to 
mark important differences or resemblances thus the 
general receptacle of the flower as it is termed by 
linnaeus or torus by salisbury is continued into 
organs which carry the stamina and pistil or the pistil 
alone or the whole flower this organ has hence been 
termed gonophorc carpophore and anthophore in 
these cases 

in like manner when cuvier had ascertained that 
the lower jaws of saurians consisted always of six 
pieces having definite relations of form and position 
he gave names to them and termed them respectively 
the dental the angular the coronoid the articular 
the complementary and the opercular bones 

in all these cases the descriptive terms thus intro 
duced have been significant in their derivation an 
attempt to circulate a perfectly arbitrary word as a 
means of description would probably be unsuccessful 
we have indeed some examples approaching to arbi 
trary designations iit the wernerian names of colours

which are a part f the terminolbgy of natural his 
tory many of these names are borrowed from natural 
resemblances as auricula purple apple green straw 
yellow but thp names of others are taken from casual 
occurrences mostly however such as were already 
recognized in common language as prussian blue 
dutch orange kings yellow 

the extension of arbitrary names in scientific termi 
nology is by no means to be encouraged i may men 
tion a case in which it was very properly avoided 
when mr faraday’s researches on voltaic electricity 
had led him to perceive the great impropriety of the 
term poles as applied to the apparatus since the pro 
cesses have not reference to any opposed points but to 
two opposite directions of a path lie very suitably 
wished to substitute for the phrases positive pole and 
negative pole two words enfting in ode from a 
way a person who did not see the value of our pre 
sent maxim that descriptive terms should be descrip 
tive in their origin might have pfoposed words per 
fectly arbitrary as alphode and betode or if he 
wished to pay a tribute of respect to the discoverers 
in this department of science galvanode and voltaode 
but such words would very justly have been rejected 
by mr faraday and would hardly have obtained any 
r general currency among men of science zincode and 
platinode terms derived from the metal which in one 
modification of the apparatus forms what was pre 
viously termed the pole are to be • avoided because in 
their origin too much is casual and they are not a 
good basis for derivative terms the pole at which 
the zinc is is the anode or cathode according as it is 
associated with different metals either the zincode 
must sometimes mean the pole at which the zinc is 
and at other times that at which the zinc is not or 
else we must have as many names for poles as there 
are metals anode and cathode the terms which mr 
faraday adopted were free from these objections for 
they rfer to a natural standard ©f the direction of the 
voltaic current in a manner which though perhaps 
not obvious at first sight is easily understood and

retained auoq and cwiodc the rising and the setting

west in that voltaic current to which we mmt ascribe 
terrestrial magnetism and with these words it was 
easy to connect anion and cattiion to designate the 
opposite elements which are separated and liberated at 
the two electrodes 


aphorism xix 

the meaning of technical terms must he fixed hy con 
vention not by casual reference to the ordinary meaning of 
words 

in fixing the ’meaning of the technical terms which 
form the terminology of any science at least of the 
descriptive terms we necessarily fix at the same time 
the perceptions and notions which the terms are to 
convey to a hearer what do we mean by applegreen or 
french grey t if might perhaps be supposed that in 
the first example the term apple referring to so fami 
liar an object sufficiently suggests the colour intended 
but it may easily be seen that this is not true for 
apples are of many different hues of green and it is 
only by a conventional selection that we can appro 
priate the term to one special shade when this appro 
priation is once made the term refers to the sensation 
and not to the parts of this term for these enter into 
the compound merely as a help to the memory whether 
the suggestion be a natural connexion as in ‘ apple 
green’ or a casual one as in c french grey in order 
to derive due advantage from technical terms of this 
land they must be associated immediately with the per 
ception to which they belong and not connected with 
it through the vague usages of common language the 
memory must retain the sensation and the technical 
word must be understood as directly as the most fami 
liar word and more distinctly when we find such 
terms as tinwhite br pinchbeckbrown the metallic 
colour so denoted ought to start up in our memory 
without delay or search 



the language op science 

this which it is most important to recollect with 
respect to the simpler properties of bodies as colour 
and form is no less true with respect to more compound 
notions in alj cases the term is fixed to a peculiar 
meaning by convention and the student in order to 
use the word must be completely familiar with the con 
vention so that he has no need to frame conjectures 
from the word itself such conjectures would always 
he insecure and often erroneous thus the term papi 
lionaceous applied to a flower is employed to indicate 
not only a resemblance to a butterfly but a resemblance 
arising from five petals of a certain peculiar shape and 
arrangement and even if the resemblance to a butter 
fly were much stronger than it is in sfuch cases yet if it 
were produced in a different way as for example by 
one petal or two only instead of a ‘standard’ two 
‘wings’ and a ‘keel’ consisting of two parts more or 
less united into one we should no longer be justified in 
speaking of it as a ‘papilionaceous’ flower 

the formation of an exact and extensive descriptive 
language for botany has been executed with a degree of 
skill and felicity which before it was attained could 
hardly have been dreamt of as attainable every pait 
of a plant has been named and the form of every part 
even the most minute has had a large assemblage of de 
scriptive terms appropriated to it by means of which 
the botanist can convey and receive knowledge of form 
and structure as exactly as if each minute part were 
presented to him vastly magnified this acquisition 
was part of the linnsean llcform of which we have 
spoken in the history ‘ tournefort’ says de candolle 

‘ appears to have been the first who really perceived the 
utility of fixing the sense of terms in such a way as al 
ways to employ the same word in the same sense and 
always to express the same idea by the same word but 
it was linnaeus who really created and fixed this bota 
nical language and this is his fairest claim to glory for 
by this fixation of language he has shed clearness and 
precision over all parts of the scieace’

 aphorisms concerning 

it is not necessary here to give ny detailed account 
of the terms of botany the fundamental ones have 
been gradually introduced as the parts of piants were 
more carefully and minutely examined thus the 
flower was successively distinguished into the calyx the 
corolla the stamens and the pistils the sections of 
the corolla were termed petals by columna those of 
the calyx were called sepals by neckar sometimes ’ 
terms of greater generality were devised as perianth 
to include the calyx and corolla whether one or both of 
these were present pericarp for the part inclosing the 
grain of whatever kind it be fruit nut pod c and 
it may easily be imagined that descriptive terms may 
by definition and combination become very numerous 
and distinct thus leaves may be called pinnatifid pin 
nati partite pinnatisect pinnatilobate palmatifid pal 
mati partite c and each of these words designates 
different combinations of the modes and extent of the 
divisions of the leaf with the divisions of its outline in 
some cases arbitrary numerical relations are introduced 
into the definition thus a leaf is called bilobate when 
it is divided into two parts by a notch but if the notch 
go to the middle of its length it is bifid if it go near 
the base of the leaf it is bipartite if to the base it is 
bisect thus too a pod of a cruciferous plant is a silica f 
if it be four times as long as it is broad but if it be 
shorter than this it is a silicula such terms being 
established the form of the very complex leaf or frond 
of a fern is exactly conveyed for example by the fol 
lowing phrase ‘ fronds rigid pinnate pin me recurved 
subunilateral pinnatifid the segments linear undivided 
or bifid spinulososerratev 

other characters as well as form are conveyed with 
the like precision colour by means of a classified scale 
of colours as we have seen in speaking of the measures

of secondary qualifies to” wliih however we must 
add that the naturalist employs arbitrary names such 
as we have already quoted and not mere numerical 
exponent to indicate a certain number of selected 
colours this was done with most precision by werner 
and his scale of colours is still the most usual standard 
of naturalists werner also introduced a more exact 
terminology with regard to other characters which are 
important in mineralogy as lustre hardness but 
mohs improved upon this step by giving a numerical 
scale of hardness in which talc is gypsum calc spar 
 and so on as we have already explained in the his 
tory of mineralogy some properties as specific gra 
vity by their definition give at nce a numerical 
measure and others as crystalline form require a 
very considerable array of mathematical calculation 
and reasoning to point out tlteir relations and grada 
tions in all cases the features of likeness in the ob 
jects must be rightly apprehended in order to their 
being expressed by a distinct terminology thus no 
terms could describe crystals for any purpose of natural 
history till it was discovered that in a class of minerals 
the proportion of the faces might vary while the angle 
remained the same nor could crystals be described so 
as to distinguish species till it was found that the de 
rived and primitive forms are connected by very simple 
relations of space and number the discovery of the 
mode in which characters must be apprehended so that 
they may be considered as fixed foy a class is an im 
portant step in the progress of each branch of natural 
history and hence we have had in the history of 
mineralogy and botany to distinguish as important 
and eminent persons those who made such discoveries 
borne de lisle and haiiy cesalpinus and gesner 

by the continued progress of that knowledge of mi 
nerals plants and other natural objects in which such 
persons made the most distinct and marked steps but 
which has been constantly advancing in a more gradual 
and imperceptible manner the mpst important and es 
sential features of similarity and dissimilarity in such 
sbjects have been selected arranged and fitted with 



 aphorisms concerning 

names and we havo tlms in such departments systems 
of terminology which fix our attention upon the resem 
blances which it is proper to consider and enable us to 
convey them in words 

the following aphorisms respect the form of tech 
nical terms 

by the form of terms i mean their philological 
conditions as for example from what languages they 
may be borrowed by what modes of inflexion they 
must be compounded how their derivatives are to be 
formed and the like in this as in other parts of the 
subject i shall not lay down a system of rules but 
shall propose a few maxims 

ariiomsm xx 

the two main conditioiis o f the form of technical terms 
arc that they must he generally intelligible and susceptible 
of such grammatical relations as their scientific use requires 

these conditions may at first appear somewhat 
vague but it will be found that they are as definite as 
we could make them without injuriously restricting 
ourselves it will appear moreover that they have 
an important bearing upon most of the questions re 
specting the form of the words which come before us • 
and that if we can succeed in any case in reconciling 
the two conditions we obtain terms which are practi 
cally good whatever objections may be urged against 
them from other considerations 

i the former condition for instance bears upon 
the question whether scientific terms are to be taken 
from the learned languages greek and latin or from 
our own and the latter condition very materially 
affects the same question since in english we have 
scarcely any power of inflecting our words and there 
fore must have recourse to greek or latin in order to 
obtain terms which admit of grammatical modification 
if we were content ith the term heat to express the 
science of heat still it would be a bad technical tel’m 
for we cannot derive fr om it an adjective like thermo 



the language of science 

tical if bed or layer were an €pily good term with 
stratum we must still retain the latter in order that 
we may use the derivative stratification for which the 
english words cannot produce an equivalent substi 
tute we may retain the words lime and flint but 
their adjectives for scientific purposes are not limy 
and flinty but calcareous and siliceous and hence we 
are able to form a compound as calcareosiliceous 
which we could not do with indigenous words we 
might fix the phrases bent bach and broken to mean of 
optical rays that they are reflected and refracted but 
then we should have no means of speaking of the 
angles of reflection and refraction of the refractive 
indices and the like 

in like manner so long as anatomist described cer 
tain parts of a vertebra as vertebral laminae or verte 
bral plates they had no adjective whereby to signify 
the properties of these parts the term neur apophysis 
given to them by mr owen supplies the correspond 
ing expression neurapophysial so again the term 
rasisphenoid employed by the same anatomist is 
better than basilar or basial process of the sphenoid 
because it gives us the adjective basisphenoidal and 
the like remark applies to other changes recently 
proposed in the names of portions of the skeleton 

thus one of the advantages of going to the greek 
and latin languages for the origin of our scientific 
terms is that ift this way we obtain words which 
admit of the formation of adjectives and abstract 
terms and of composition and of other inflexions an 
other advantage of such an origin is that such terms 
if well selected are readily understood over the whole 
lettered world for this reason the descriptive lan 
guage of science of botany for instance has been for 
the most part taken from the latin many of the 
tbrms of the mathematical and chemical sciences have 
been derived from the greek and when occasion 
occurs to construct a new term it is generally to that 
language that recourse is had the advantage of such 
ternts is as has already been intimated that they con 
stitute an universal language by means of which 



 aphorisms concerning 

cultivated persons m every country may convey to 
each other their ideas without the need of translation 

on the other hand the advantage of indigenous 
terms is that so far as the language extends they are 
intelligible much more clearly and vividly than those 
borrowed from any other source as well as more easily 
manageable in the construction of sentences in the 
descriptive language of botany for example in an 
english work the terms drooping nodding onesided 
homing straggling appear better than cernuous nu 
tant secund volubile divaricate for though the 
latter terms may by habit become as intelligible as the 
former they cannot become more so to any readers 
and to most english readers they will give a far less 
distinct impression 

 since the advantage of indigenous over learned 
terms or the contrary depends upon the balance of 
the capacity of inflexion and composition on the one 
hand against a ready and clear significance on the 
other it is evident that the employment of scientific 
terms of the one class or of the other may very pro 
perly be extremely different in different languages 
the german possesses in a very eminent degree that 
power of composition and derivation which in english 
can hardly be exercised at all in a formal manner 
hence german scientific writers use native terms to 
a far greater extent than do our own authors the 
descriptive terminology of botany and even the sys 
tematic nomenclature of chemistry are represented 
by the germans by means of german roots and in 
flexions thus the description of potentilla anserina 
in english botanists is that it has leaves interruptedly 
pinnate serrate silky stem creeping stalks axillar 
oneflowered here we have words of saxon and 
latin origin mingled pretty equally but the german 
description is entirely teutonic die blume in ached 
die blatter unterbrochen gefiedert die bldttchen scharf 
gesagt die stamms kriechend die bluthenstiele einblu 
mig we could imitate this in our own language by 
saying brokenlyfeathered sharpsawed by usirfg threed 
for ternate as the germans employ gedreit by saying 



the language of science 


 


fingeredfeathered for digitatofairtnate and the like 
but the habit which we have in common as well as 
scientific language of borrowing words from the latin 
for new cases would make such usages seem very 
harsh and pedantic 

we may add that in consequence of these different 
practices in the two languages it is a common habit 
of the german reader to impose a scientific definite 
ness upon a common word such as our fifth aphorism 
requires whereas the english reader expects rather 
that a word which is to have a technical sense shall be 
derived from the learned languages die kelch and 
die blame the cup and the flower easily assume the 
technical meaning of calyx and crolla die griffel 
the pencil becomes the pistil and a name is easily 
found for the pollen the anthers and the stamens by 
calling them the dust the dhstcases and the dust 
threads der jstaub die staubbeutel or staubfacher 
and die titaubfaden this was formerly done in 
english to a greater extent than is nbw possible with 
out confusion and pedantry thus in grew’s book on 
the anatomy of plants the calyx is called the impale 
ment and the sepals the impalers the petals are called 
the leaves of the flower the stamens with their anthers 
are the seminiform attire but the english language 
as to such matters is now less flexible than it was 
partly in consequence of its having adopted the lin 
lisean terminology almost entire without any endea 
vour to naturalize it any attempt at idiomatic de 
scription would interfere with the scientific language 
now generally received in this country in germany 
on the other hand those who first wrote upon science 
in their own language imitated the latin words which 
they found in foreign writers instead of transferring 
new roots into their own language thus the nume 
rator and denominator of a fraction they call the 
namer and the counter nenner and zahler this 
course they pursued even where the expression was 
erroneous thus that portion of the intestines which 
ancient anatomists called duodenum because they 
faely estimated its length at twelve inches the ger 
nov okg 



 aphorisms concerning 

mans also term zwil l finger darm twelveinchgut 
though this intestine in a whale is twenty feet long 
and in a frog not above twenty lines as another 
example of this process in german we may take the 
word muttersaclcbauchblatte the uterine peritonaeum 

it is a remarkable evidence of this formative power 
of the german language that it should have been 
able to produce an imitation of the systematic chemi 
cal nomenclature of the french school so comjdlete 
that it is used in germany as familiarly as the origi 
nal system is in france and england thus oxygen 
and hydrogen are sauer staff and wafferstoff azote is 
stickstoff suffocating matter sulphuric and sulphu 
rous acid are sdhwefelsdure and schwefelichtesdure 
the sulphate foul sulphite of baryta and sulphuret 
of baryum are schwefelsdure baryterde schweelichte 
sdure baryterde and sihwef elbar yum carbonate of 
iron is kohlensdures eisenoxydul and we may ob 
serve that in such cases the german name is much 
more agreeable tb analogy than the english one for 
the protoxide of iron eisenoxydul and not the 
iron itself is the base of the salt a nd the german 
language has not only thus imitated the established 
nomenclature of chemistry but has shown itself capa 
ble of supplying new forms to meet the demands 
which the progress of theory occasions thus the 
hydracids are wasserstoffsduren and of these flic 
hydriodic acid is lodwasserstoffsduw and so of the 
rest in like manner the translator of berzelius has 
found german names for the stilphosalts of that 
chemist thus he has wasser staff schioefliges scliewef el 
lithium which would be if we vero to adopt his 
theoretical view hydro sulplmret of sulphuret of 
lithium and a like nomenclature for all other similar 
cases 

 in english we have no power of imitating this 
process and must take our technical phrases from 
some more flexible language and generally from the 
latin or greek we arc indeed so much accustomed 
to do this that except a word has its origin in one f 
these languages it hardly seems to us a technical 



the language of science 

term and thus by employing nigenous terms even 
descriptive ones we may perhaps lose in precision 
more thogi we gain in the vividness of the impression 
perhaps it may be better to say cuneate lunate has 
tate sagittate reniform than wedgesharped crescent 
shaped halbertheaded arrowheaded kidneyshaped 
ringent and personate are better than any english 
words which we could substitute for them labiate is 
more precise than lipped would readily become ur 
ceolate trochlear are more compact than pitchershaped 
pulleyshaped and infundibuliform hypocrateriform 
though long words are not more inconvenient than 
funnelshaped and salvershaped in the same way it 
is better to speak with lr pricharcl of repent and 
progressive animals than of creeping and progressive 
the two latin terms make a better pair of correlatives 

 but wherever we may draw the line between 
the proper use of english and latin terms in descrip 
tive phraseology we shall find it advisable to borrow 
almost all other technical terms from the learned lan 
guages we have seen this in considering the new 
terms introduced into various sciences in virtue of our 
ninth maxim we may add as further examples 
the names of the various animals of which a know 
ledge has been acquired from the remains of them 
which exist in various strata and which have been 
reconstructed by cuvier and his successors such are 
the palftotherium the anoplotlierium the megathe 
rium the dinotherium the ghirothrium the megal 
ichthys the mastodon the ichthyosaurus the plesio 
saurus the pterodactylus to these others are every 
year added as for instance very recently the 
toxodon zeuglodon and phascolotherium of mr owen 
and the thylacotherium of m valenciennes still 
more recently the terms glyptodon mylodon zhcyno 
don paloplotherium phynchosaurus have been added 
by mr owen to designate fossil animals newly deter

 aphorisms concerning 

the names of specie as well as of genera are thus 
formed from the greek as the plesiosaurus dolieho 
deirus longnecked ichthyosaurus platyodop broad 
toothed the irish elk termed cervus megaceros 
largehorned but the descriptive specific names are 
also taken from the latin as plesiosaurus brevirostris 
longirostris crassirostris besides which there are 
arbitrary specific names which we do not here con

these names being all constructed at a period when 
naturalists were familiar with an artificial system the 
standard language of which is latin have not been 
taken from modern language but the names of living 
animals and even of their classes long ago formed in 
the comlnon language of men have been in part adopted 
in the systems of naturalists agreeably to aphorism 
third hence the language of systems in natural 
history is mixed of ancient and modern languages 
thus cuvier’s divisions of the veftebrated animals are 
mammi feres latin oiseaux reptiles poissons bi 
vnanes quadrumanes carnassieres rongeurs pachy 
dernics greek ruminans latin ce taces latin in 
the subordinate divisions the distribution being more 
novel the names are less idiomatic thus the kinds of 
beptiles are cheloniens sauriens ophidiens batra 
ciensf all which are of greek origin in like maimer 
fish are divided into ghondropterygiens malacoptery 
giens acanthopterygiens the unvertebrated animals 
are mollusques afoimaux articules and animaux ray 
onnes and the mollnsques are divided into six classes 
chiefly according to the position or form of their foot 
namely cephalopodes pteropodes g aster opodes ace 
phales brachiopodes cirrkopodes 

in transferring these terms into english when the 
term is new in french as well as english we have 
little difficulty for wo may take nearly the same 
liberties in english which are taken in french and 
hence we may say rnammifers rather mammals ceta 
ceans or cetaces baftucians rather batrachians using 
the words as substantives but in other cases vte 
must go back to the latin thus we say radiate aii

mr kirby has proposed radiary radiaries for

 when new mineral species have been established 
in recent times they have generally had arbitrary 
names assigned to them derived from some person or 
places in some instances however descriptive names 
have been selected and then these have been generally 
taken from the greek as augite stilbite diaspore 
dichroite jjiopiase several of these greek names 
imposed by haiiy refer to some circumstances often 
fancifully selected in his view of the crystallization of 
the substance as epidote reridote eleonast similar 
terms of greek origin have been introduced by others 
as orthite anorthite reriklin greek names founded 
on casual circumstances are “less to be commended 
berzelius has termed a mineral eschynite from a fo 
x vv v shame because it is he conceives a shame for 
chemists not to have separated its elements more dis 
tinctly than they did at first 

 in botany the old names of genera of greek ori 
gin are very numerous and many of them are descrip 
tive as glyeyrhiza yxvkvs and sweet root liquor 
ice rhododendron rosetree hcematoxylon bloody 
wood chrysocoma golden hair alopecurus foxtail 
and many more in like manner there are names 
which derive a descriptive significance from the latin 
either adjectives as impatiens ghriosa sagittaria 
or substantives irregularly formed as tussilago a 
tussis domatione urtica ab urendo tactu salsola 
a salsedine but these though good names when they 
ar established by tradition are hardly to be imitated 
in naming new plants in most instances when this 
is to be done arbitrary or local names have been 
selected as strelitzia 

 in chemistry new substances have of late had 
names assigned them from greek roots as ioditie from 
its violet colour chlorine from its green colour in 
likemafiner fluorine has by the french chemists been 
called fhthor from its destructive properties so the 



 aphorisms concerning 

new metals chrome jthodium jricum osmium had 
names of greek derivation descriptive of their proper 
ties some such terms however were borrowed from 
localities as strontia yttria the names of new earths 
others have a mixed origin as pyrogallic pyroacetic 
and pyroligneous spirit in some cases the derivation 
has been extravagantly capricious thus in the pro 
cess for making pyrogallic acid a certain substance is 
left behind from which m braconnot extracted an 
acid which he called ellagic a cid framing the root of 
the name by reading the word galle backwards 

the new laws which the study of electrochemistry 
brought into view required a new terminology to ex 
press their conditions and in this case as we have 
observed in speaking of the twelfth maxim arbitrary 
words are less suitable mr faraday very properly 
borrowed from the grefik his terms electrolyte elec 
trde anode cathode anton gatliion dielectric in 
the mechanicochomical and mechanical sciences how 
ever new terms are less copiously required than in the 
sciences of classification and when they are needed 
they are generally determined by analogy from existing 
terms thermoelectricity and electrodynamics were 
terms which very naturally offered themselves no 
bili’s thermomultiplier snow harris’s unitjar were 
almost equally obvious names in such cases it is 
generally possible to construct terms both compendious 
and descriptive without introducing any new radical 
words 

 the subject of crystallography has inevitably 
given rise to many new terms since it brings under 
our notice a great number of new relations of a very 
definite but very complex form haiiy attempted 
to find names for all the leading varieties of crystals 
and for this purpose introduced a great number of 
new terms founded on various analogies and allusions 
thus the forms of calcspar are termed by him primi 
tive equiaxe inverse metastatique contrastante imi 
table birhomboidale prismatique apophane unitemaire y 
bisunitaire dodecaedre contractee dilutee semuodeci 
male bisalterne binournaire and many others the

want of uniformity in tli orifjinand scheme of these 
denominations would be no valid objection tc them if 
any general truth could be expressed by means of 
them rut the fact is that there is no definite dis 
tinction of these forms they pass into each other 
 by insensible gradations and the optical and physical 
properties which they possess are common to all of 
them and as a mere enunciation of laws of form 
this terminology is insufficient thus it does not at 
all convey the relation between the bisalterne and the 
binoternaire the former being a combination of the 
metastatique with the prismatique the latter of the 
metastatique with the coitrastante again the contra 
stante the mixte the cuboide the •contractee the di 
lutee all contain faces generated by a ommoi law the 
index being respectively altered so as to be in these 
cases § f„ £ and thi which is the most im 
portant geometrical relation of these forms no at 
all recorded or indicated by the nomenclature the 
fact is that it is probably impossible the subject of 
crystallography having become so complex as it now is 
to devise a system of names which shall express the 
relations of form numerical symbols such as those 
of weiss or naumann or professor miller are the 
proper ways of expressing these relations and are the 
only good crystallographic terminology for cases in 
detail 

the icrms usfed in expressing crystallographic laws 
have been for the most part taken from the greek by 
all writers except some of the germans these we 
have already stated have constructed terms in their 
own language as zweiundein gliedrig and the like 

•in optics we have some new terms connected with 
crystalline laws as uniaxal and biaxal crystals optical 
axes which offered themselves without any effort on 
the part of the discoverers in the whole history of 
the undulatory theory very few innovations in lan 
guage were found necessary except to fix the sense of 
a few phrases as planepolarized jight in opposition to 
• cireulahypolarized and the like 

• this is still more the case in mechanics astronomy 



 aphorfems concerning 

and pure mathematics in these sciences several of 
the priipary stages of generalization being already 
passed over when any new steps are made we have 
before us some analogy by which we may frame our 
new terms thus when the plane of maximum areas 
was discovered it had not some new arbitrary denomi 
nation assigned it but the name which obviously de 
scribed it was fixed as a technical name 

the result of this survey of the scientific terms of 
recent formation seems to be this — that indigenous 
terms may be employed in the descriptions of facts 
and phenomena as they at first present themselves 
and in the first induction from these but that when 
we come to generalize and theorize terms borrowed 
from tlip learned languages are more readily fixed and 
made definite and are also more easily connected with 
derivatives our native terms are more impressive 
an athirst more intelligible but they may wander 
from their scientific meaning and are capable of little 
inflexion wordy of classical origin are precise to the 
careful student and capable of expressing by their 
inflexions the relations of general ideas but they are 
unintelligible even to the learned man without ex 
press definition and convey instruction only through 
an artificial and rare habit of thought 

since in the balance between words of domestic and 
of foreign origin so much depends upon the possibility 
of inflexion and derivation i shall consider a little 
more closely what are the limits and considerations 
which we have to take into account in reference to 
that subject 


afhorism xxi 

in the composition and inflexion of technical terms phi 
lological analogies are to he preserved if possible but modi 
fied according to scientific convenience 

in the language employed or proposed by writers 
upon subjects of science many combinations and forms 
of derivation occur which would be rejected aid con 
demned by those who are careful of the purity and 



the language otf science 


 


correctness of language sue anomalies are to be 
avoided as much as possible but it is impcjssible to 
escape them altogether if we are to have a scientific 
language which has any chance of being received into 
general use it is better to admit compounds which 
are not philologically correct than to invent many 
new words all strange to the readers for whom they 
are intended and in writing on science in our own 
language it is not possible to avoid making additions 
to the vocabulary of common life since science re 
quires exact names for many things which common 
language has not named and although these new 
names should as much as possible be constructed in 
conformity with the analogies of fflie language such 
extensions of analogy can hardly souifd to the gram 
marian’s ear otherwise than as solecisms but as our 
maxim indicates the analogy of science is of more 
weight with us than the analogy of language andal 
tliough anomalies in our phraseology should be avoided 
as much as possible innovations must be permitted 
wherever a scientific language easy to acquire and 
convenient to use is unattainable without them 

i shall proceed to mention some of the transgres 
sions of strict philological rules and some of the 
extensions of grammatical forms which the above 
conditions appear to render necessary 

 the combination of different languages in the 
derivation of wol’ds though to be avoided in genera 
is in some cases admissible 

such words are condemned by quintilian and other 
grammarians under the name of hybrids or things of a 
mixed race as bidinium from bis and kxcvtj epitogium 
ftofti evt and toga nor are such terms to be un 
necessarily introduced in science whenever a homo 
geneous word can be formed and adopted with the 
same ease and convenience as a hybrid it is to be pre 
ferred hence we must have ichthyology not piscology 
entomology not insectology insectivorous not insect 
ophagous in like manner it woild be better to say 
hnomlu than monoculus though the latter has the 
sanction of linnaeus who was a jurist in such matters 



 


aphorisms concerning 


dr turner in his chei iistry speaks of •protoxides and 
binoxide which combination violates the rule for 
making the materials of our terms as homogeneous as 
possible protoxide and deutoxide would be preferable 
both on this and on other accounts 

yet this rule admits of exceptions mineralogy 
with its greek termination has for its root minera a 
medieval latin word of teutonic origin and is prefer 
able to oryctology terminology appears to be better 
than glossology which according to its derivation 
would be rather the science of language in general 
than of technical terms and horology from ops a 
term would not be immediately intelligible even to 
greek scholars and is already employed to indicate 
the science whijh treats of horologes or timepieces 

indeed the english reader is become quite familiar 
with the termination ology the names of a large num 
ber of branches of science and learning having that 
form this termination is at present rather appre 
hended as a formative affix in our own language indi 
cating a science than as an element borrowed from 
foreign language hence when it is difficult or im 
possible to find a greek term which clearly designates 
the subject of a science it is allowable to employ some 
other as in tidology the doctrine of the tides 

the same remark applies to some other greek ele 
ments of scientific words they are so familiar to us 
that in composition they are almost used as part of 
our own language this naturalization has taken 
place very decidedly in the element arch dpxos a 
leader as we see in archbishop archduke it is ef 
fected in a great degree for the preposition anti thus 
we speak of antislavery societies antireformers anti 
bilious or antiacid medicines without being conscious 
of any anomaly the same is the case with the latin 
preposition prce or pre as appears from such words as 
preengage prearrange prejudge prepaid and in 
some measure with pro for in colloquial language we 
speak of procatholics and anticatholics also the 
preposition ante is similarly usecl as antenicenb fathers 
the preposition co abbreviated from con and imply

ing things to be simultaifeous lor® connected is firmly 
established as part of the language as we see ifi coexist 
coheir coordinate hence i have called those lines co 
tidal lidfes which pass through places where the high 
water of the tide occurs simultaneously 

 as in the course of the mixture by which our 
language has been formed we have thus lost all habi 
tual consciousness of the difference of its ingredients 
greek latin normanfrench and anglosaxon we 
have also ceased to confine to each ingredient the mode 
of grammatical inflexion which originally belonged to 
it • thus the termination ive belongs peculiarly to 
latin adjectives yet we say sportive talkative in 
like manner able is added to wods which are not 
latin as eatable drinkable pitiable •enviably also 
the termination al and ical are used with various roots 
as loyal royal farcical wfamsical hence we may 
make the adjective tidal from tide this ending al 
is also added to abstract terms in ion as occasional 
provisional intentional national hence we may if 
necessary use such words as educational termina 
tional the ending ic appears to be suited to proper 
names as pindaric socratic platonic hence it may 
be used when scientific words are derived from proper 
names as voltaic or galvanic electricity to which i 
have proposed to add franklinic 

•• in adopting scientific adjectives from the latin we 
have nqt much room for hesitation for in such cases 
the habits of derivation from that language into our 
own are very constant ivus becomes ive as decursive 
inus becomes ine as in ferine atus becomes ate as 
hastate and us often becomes ous as rufous aris be 
comes ary as axillary ens becomes ent as ringent 
and in adopting into our language as scientific terms 
words which in another language the french for in 
stance have a latin origin familiar to us we cannot 
do better than form them as if they were derived 
directly from the latin hence the french adjectives 
cetace crustace testace may became either cetaceous 
vruetacbous testaceous according to the analogy of 
farinaceous predaceous or elp cetacean crustacean 



 


aphorisms concerning 


testacean imitating iht form of patrician since as 
i shall sgon have to notioe we require substantives as 
well as adjectives from these words we must at least 
for that use take the forms last suggested 

in pursuance of the same remark rongeur becomes 
rodent and edente would become edentate but that 
thisword is rejected on another account the adjec 
tives bimane and quadrumane are bimanous and quad 
yumanous 

 there is not much difficulty in thus forming 
adjectives but the purposes of natural history re 
quire that we should have substantives corresponding 
to these adjectives and these cannot be obtained with 
out some extensictn of the analogies of our language 
we cannot in general use adjectives or participles as 
singular substantives the happy or the doomed would 
according to good english usage signify those who are 
happy and those who are doomed in the plural hence 
we could not speak of a particular scaled animal as the 
squamate and still less could we call any such animal 
a squamate or speak of squa nates in the plural some 
of the forms of our adjectives however do admit of 
this substantive use thus we talk of europeans ple 
beians republicans of divines and masculine of the 
ultramontanes of mordants and brilliants of abster 
gents and emollients of mercenaries and tributaries 
of animals manuals and officials of dissuasives an’u 
motives we cannot generally use in this way adjectives 
in ous nor in ate though reprobates is an exception 
nor english participles nor adjectives in which there 
is no termination imitating the latin as happy good 
hence if we have for purposes of science to convert 
adjectives into substantives we ought to follow the 
form of examples like these in which it has already 
appeared in fact that such usage though an innova 
tion at first may ultimately become a received part of 
the language 

by attention to this rule we may judge what ex 
pressions to select jn cases where substantives are 
needed i will take as an example the division of 
the mammalian animals into orders these orders

according to cuvijr are bimaaesf quadrumanes car 
nassiers rongeurs edentes ruminans pactydermes 
cetaces and of these bimanes quadrumanes ro 
dents ruminants pachyderms are admissible as en 
glish substantives on the grounds just stated cetaceous 
could not be used substantively but cetacean in such 
a usage is sufficiently countenanced by such cases as 
we have mentioned •patrician c hence we adopt 
this form we have no english word equivalent to 
the french camassiers the english translator of 
cuvier has not provided english words for his tech 
nical terms but has formed a latin word carnaria 
to represent the french terms from this we might 
readily form carnaries but it appears much better to 
take the linnscan name ferce as our iot from which 
we may take ferine substantive as well as adjective 
and hence we call this order ferines the word for 
which it is most difficult to provide a proper represen 
tation is edente edentata for as we have said it 
would be very harsh to speak of fche order as the 
edentates and if we were to abbreviate the word 
into edent we should suggest a false analogy with 
rodent for as rodent is quod rodit that which gnaws 
edent would be quod edit that which eats and even 
if we were to take edent as a substantive we could 
hardly use it as an adjective we should still have to 
say for example the edentate form of head for these 
reasons it appeals best to alter the form of the word 
and to call the order the edentls which is quite 
allowable both as adjective and substantive 

an objection might be made to this term both in 
its latin french and english form namely that the 
natural group to which it is applied includes many 
species both existing and extinct well provided with 
teeth thus the armadillo is remarkable for the num 
ber of its teeth the megatherium for their complex 
structure but the analogy of scientific language 
readily permits us to fix upon the word edntata a 
special meaning implying the absence of one parti 
cular kind of teeth namely incisive teeth linnseus 
sailed the equivalent order bruta we could not 



 


aphorisms concerning 


apply in this case thb term ’brutes i for common lan 
guage hafi already attached to the word a wider mean 
ing too fixedly for scientific use to trifle with jt 

there are several other words in ate about which 
there is the same difficulty in providing substantive 
forms are we to speak of vertebrates or would it 
not be better in agreement with what has been said 
above to call these vertebrals and the opposite class 
invertebrals 

there are similar difficulties with regard to the 
names of subordinate portions of zoological classifica 
tion thus the eerincs are divided by cuvier into 
cheiropteres insectivores carnivores and these latter 
into plantigrades digitigrades amphibies marsupi 
aux there is hot any great harshness in naturalizing 
these substantives as chiropters insectivores carni 
vores plantigrades digitigrades amphibians and 
marsupials these words carnivores and insectivores 
are better because of more familiar origin than greek 
terms otherwise we might if necessary speak of 
zoophagans and entomophagans 

it is only with certain familiar adjectival termina 
tions as ous and ate that there is a difficulty in using 
the word as substantive when this can be avoided 
we readily accept the new word as pachyderms and 
in like manner mollnsks 

if we examine the names of the orders of birds we 
find that they are in latin predator es or acwipitres 
passeres jscansoret rasores or gallince gr ablator es 
palmipedes and anseres cuvier’s orders are oiseaux 
de prole passercaux grimpeurs gallinaces echas 
siers palmipedes these may be englished conveni 
ently as predators passerines scansors gallinaceims 
rather than rasors grallators palndpedans or 
rather palmipeds like ripeds ecansors grallators 
and rasors are better as technical terms than climb 
ers waders and er ateliers we might venture to 
angliciztf the terminations of the names which cuvier 
gives to the divisions of these orders thus the pre 
dators are the jhurnals and the nocturnals ‘the 
passerines are the dmtirostres the fissirostrcs the

conirostres the tepuirostfes aid he syndactyls the 
word lustre showing that the former termination is 
allowable the scansors are not subdivided nor are 
the galtinaceans the grallators are pressirostres 
cultrirostres macrodactyls the palmipeds are the 
plungers the longipens the totipalmes and the 
lamellirostres 

the next class of vertebral s is the reptiles and 
these are either chelonians saurians ophidians or 
batrachians cuvier writes batraciens but we prefer 
the spelling to which the greek word directs us 

the last or lowest class is the fishes in which pro 
vince cuvier has himself been the great systematist 
and has therefore had to devise many new terms 
many of these are of greek or latin origin and can 
be anglicized by the analogies already pointed out as 
chondropterygians malacoplkrygians lophobranchs 
plectognaths gymnodonts scleroderms discoholes and 
apodes may be english as well as french there are 
other cases in which the author has formed the names 
of families either by forming a word in ides from the 
name of a genus as gadoides gobioides or by galliciz 
ing the latin name of the genus as halmones from 
salmo clupcs from clupea fsoces from fsox gyprius 
from gyprinus in these cases agassiz’s favourite form 
of names for families of fishes has led english writers 
m use the words gadoids gobioids salnwnoids clu 
pcoids lucioids for fsoces gyprinoids c there is 
a taint of hybridism in this termination but it is at 
tended with this advantage that it has begun to be 
characteristic of the nomenclature of family groups in 
the class pisces one of the orders of fishes coordi 
nate with the chondropterygians and the lopho 
branchs is termed osseux by cuvier it appears 
hardly worth while to invent a substantive word for 
this when bony fishes is so simple a phrase and may 
readily be understood as a technical name of a system 
atic order 

the mollusks are the next glass and these are 
divided into ceplialopod g aster op ods and the like 
the gasteropods are nndibranclm inferobranchs tecti 



aphorisms concerning 


 

branchs pectinibrant is r s cutihranchs and cyclobranchs 
in framing most of these terms cuvier has made hy 
brids by a combination of a latin word with branchice 
which is the greek name for the gills of a fish and has 
thus avoided loading the memory with words of an 
origin not obvious to most naturalists as terms derived 
from the greek would have been another division 
of the gasteropods is pulmones which we must make 
pulmonians in like manner the subdivisions of the 
pectinibranchs are the trochoidans and buccinoidans 
 trochdides buccinoides the acepliales another order 
of mollusks may be aceplials in english 

after these comes the third grand division articu 
lated animals and these are annelidam crustaceans 
arachniffans ard insects i shall not dwell upon the 
names of these as the form of english words which is 
to be selected must be • sufficiently obvious from the 
preceding examples 

finally we have the fourth grand division of animals 
the ray mines or diadiata which for reasons already 
given we may call radials or radiaries these are 
echinoderms intestinals or rather entozoans aca 
lephes and polyps the polyps which are composite 
animals in which many gelatinous individuals are con 
nected so as to have a common life have in many cases 
a more solid framework belonging to the common part 
of the animal this framework of which coral isa 
special example is termed in french polypipr the 
word has been anglicized by the word polypary after 
the analogy of aviary and apiary thus polyps are 
either polyps with polyparies or naked polyps 

any common kind of polyps has usually in the 
english language been called polypus the greek ter 
mination being retained this termination in us 
however whether latin or greek is to be excluded 
from the english as much as possible on account of 
the embarrassment which it occasions in the formation 
of the plural for if we say polypi the word ceases to 
be english while polypuses is harsh and there is the 
additional inconvenience thgifc both these forms would 
indicate the plural of individuals rather than of classed 



the language oe science 


 


if we were to say f the cirallihesf are a family of the 
polypuses with polyparies ’ it would not at once occur 
to the rjjider that the last three words formed a tech 
nical phrase 

this termination us which must thus be exclude 
from the names of families may be admitted in the 
designation of genera of animals as nautilus echinus 
hippopotamus and of plants as crocus asparagus 
narcissus acanthus ranunculus fungus the same 
form occurs in other technical words as fucus mucus 
oesophagus hydrocephalus callus calculus uterus 
foetus radius focus apparatus it is however 
advisable to retain this form only in cases where it is 
already firmly established in the language for a more 
genuine english form is preferable hence we say 
with mr lyell ichthyosaur plesiosaur pterodactyl in 
like manner mr owen anglicizes the termination erium 
and speaks of the anoplothere and paleotheres 

since the wants of science thus demand adjectives 
which can be used also as substantive names of classes 
this consideration may sometimes serve to determine 
our selection of new terms thus mr ly ell’s names 
for the subdivisions of the tertiary strata miocene plio 
cene can be used as substantives but if such words as 
mioneous plioneous had suggested themselves they 
must have been rejected though of equivalent significa 
tion as not fulfilling this condition 

 a abstract substantives can easily be formed 

from adjectives from electric we have electricity from 
galvanic galvanism from organic organization velo 
city levity gravity arc borrowed from latin adjectives 
caloric is familiarly used for the matter of heat though 
theform of the word is not supported by any obvious 
analogy 

b it is intolerable to have words regularly 
formed in opposition to the analogy which their mean 
ing offers as when bodies are said to have conduct 
ivity or conduc ability with regard to heat the bodies 
are conductive and their £ropertyis conductive 

c the terminations ize rather than ise ism and 
ist are applied to words of all origins thus we have to 
nov oiiq 



 aphorisms concerning 

pulverize to colonize ” witticism heathenism journal 
istj tobacconist hence we may make such words when 
they are wanted as we cannot use physician for a 
cultivator of physics i have called him a physicist 

need very much a name to describe a cultivator of 
science in general i should incline to call him a 
scientist thus we might say that as an artist is a 
musician painter or poet a scientist is a mathema 
tician physicist or naturalist 

d connected with verbs in ize we have abstract 
nouns in ization as polarization crystallization these 
it appears proper to spell in english with z rather than 
s governing our practice by the greek verbal termi 
nation t£o which we imitate but we must observe 
that verbs and “substantives in yse analyse belong 
to a different analogy giving an abstract noun in ysis 
and an adjective ytic or ytical analysis analytic 
analytical hence electrolyse is more proper than 
electrolyze 

e the namfes of many sciences end in ics after 
the analogy of mathematics metaphysics as optics 
mechanics but these in most other languages as in 
our own formerly have the singular form optice v op 
tique optik opticlc and though we now write optics 
we make such words of the singular number ‘ new 
ton’s opticks is an example’ as however this con 
nexion in new words is startling as when we say 
‘thermoelectrics is now much cultivated’ it r appears 
better to employ tile singular form after the analogy 
of loyic and rhetoric when we have words to con 
struct hence we maj call the science of languages 
linguistic as it is called by the best german writers 
for instance william yon humboldt 

 in the derivation of english from latin or greek 
words the changes of letters are to be governed by the 
rules which have generally prevailed in such cases 
the greek and at the latin oe and ae are all con 
verted into a simple e as in economy geodesy penal 
cesar hence according to common usage we should 
write phenomena not phenomena paleontology not 
palaeontology miocenef not mioceene pekilite not pee

kilite but in orcfer to keep more clearly in iew the 
origin of our terms it may be allowable to deviate from 
these ruhis of change especially so long as the words 
are new and unfamiliar dr buekland speaks of the 
poikilitic not pecilitic group of strata palaeontology 
is the spelling commonly adopted and in imitation of 
this i have written palcetiology the diphthong ct was 
by the latins changed into as in aristides and 
hence this has been the usual form in english some 
recent authors indeed mr mitford for instance write 
aristeides but the former appears to be the more 
legitimate hence we write miocene pliocene not 
meiocene pleiocene the greek v becomes y and ov 
becomes u in english as in latin as crystal • cohere 
the consonants k and become c and ch accord 
ing to common usage hcice we write crystal

cuyolite as however the letter c before e and i 
differs from k which is the sound we assign to the 
greek k it may be allowable to use h in order to avoid 
this confusion thus as we have seen poiilite has 
been used as well as pecilite even in common lan 
guage some authors write sceptic which appears to be 
better than sceptic with our pronunciation and is pre 
ferred by dr johnson for the same reason namely 
to fi void confusion in the pronunciation and also in 
order to keep in view the connexion with cathode the 
elements of an electrolyte which go jo the anode and 
cathode respectively may be termed the anion and 
catdon although the greek would suggest cation

 the example of chemistry has shown that we 
have in the terminations of words a resource of which 
great use may be made in indicating the relations of 
certain classes of objects as sulphured and sulphuric 
acids sulphates sulphites and sulpliwete since the 
introduction of the artifice by the lavoisierian school 
it has been extended to some new cgses the chlorine 
fiorne • bromme iodide had their names put into 
tlufrt shape in consequence of their supposed analogy 
and for the same reason have been termed chlore

to term the basis of boracic acid bor on and those who 
conceive that the basis of silica has an analogy with

another kind it would be desirable if the change were 
not too startling ito term it seim as it is in german 
pliosphpms in hke manner might be phosplmr which 
would indicate its analogy with sulphur 

the resource which terminations offer has been ap 
plied in other cases the names of many species of 
minerals end in lite or tie as stauroto augite 
hence adolphe jbrongniart j n order to form a name 
for a genus of fossil plants has given this termination 
to the name of the recent genus which they nearly 
resemble as zam ites from zamia lvcopodites from 
lycopodium 

names of different genera which differ in termina 
tion only are properly condemned by linnaeus as 
alsine alsinoides alsinella alsinastrum for there 
is no definite relation marked by those terminations 
linnaeus gives to t such genera distinct names alsine 
bvfonia sagina elatine 

terminations are well adapted to express definite 
systematic relations such as those of chemistry but 
they must be employed with a due regard to alhthe 
bearings of the system davy proposed to denote the 
combinations of other substances with chlorine by 
peculiar terminations using ane for the smallest pro 
portion of chlorine and anea for the larger as cup 
r ane cupraea in this nomenclature common salt 
would be sodane d chloride of nitrogen would be 
azotane this suggestion never found favour it was

objected that it yas corftraryt tj the linnrean pre 
cept that a specific name must not be united to a 
generic termination but this was not putting the 
matter exactly on its right ground for the rules of 
nomenclature of natural history do not apply to 
chemistry and the linnaean rule might with equal 
propriety have been adduced as a condemnation of 
such terms as sulphurous sulphuric but davy’s 
terms were bad for it does not appear that chlorine 
enters as oxygen does into so large a portion of 
chemical compounds that its relations afford a key to 
their nature and may properly be made an element 
in their names 

this resource of terminations has been abused 
wherever it has been used wantonly oi without a defi 
nite significance in the variety this is the case in

exitezc and many others in addition to other objec

variety is a material defect for to make this variety 
depend caprice alone as in those cases it does is to 
throw away a resource of which chemical nomenclature 
may teach us the value 

aphorism xxii 

when alterations in technical terms become necessary it 
is desirable that the new term should contain in its form 
some memorial of the old one 

we have excellent examples of the advantageous 
use of this maxim in linmeus’s reform of botanical 
nomenclature his innovations were very extensive 
but they were still moderated as much as possible and 
connected in many ways with the pames of plants then 
hi ue he has himself given several rules of nomen 
clature which tend to establish this connexion of the 



 


aphorisms concerning 


olgl and new in a reform ‘ thus t lie says ‘ generic 
names vyhicli are current and are not accompanied 
with harm to botany should be tolerated ’ ‘a 
passable generic name is not to be changed for another 
though more apt ’ ‘ new generic names are not to 
te framed so long as passable synonyms are at hand ’ 
 a generic name of one genus except it be super 
fluous is not to be transferred to another genus though 
it suit the other better ’ ‘if a received genus re 
quires to be divided into several the name which 
before included the whole shall be applied to the most 
common and familiar kind ’ and though he rejects 
all generic names which have not a greek or latin 
root he is willing to make an exception in favour of 
those which from their form might be supposed to 
have such a root though they are really borrowed from 
other languages as theh which is the greek for god 
dess c effect which might seem to come from a greek 
word denoting silence kudos cheiranthus which ap 
pears to mean lmndflower but is really derived from 
the arabic keiri and many others 

as we have already said the attempt at a reforma 
tion of the nomenclature of mineralogy made by pro 
fessor mohs will probably not produce any permanent 
effect on this account amongst others that it has not 
been conducted in this temperate mode the innova 
tions bear too large a proportion to the whole of the 
names and contain too little to remind up of the 
known appellations yet in some respects professor 
mohs has acted upon this maxim thus he has cajled 
one of his classes spar because felspar belongs to it 
i shall venture to offer a few suggestions on this sub 
ject of mineralogical nomenclature 

it has already been remarked that the confusion 
and complexity which prevail in this subject render a 
reform very desirable but it will be seen from the 
reasons assigned under the ninth aphorism that no 
permanent system of names can be looked for till a

sound system of classification bfc dfetablished the best 
mineralogical systems recently published however ap 
pear to converge to a common point and certain 
classes have been formed which have both a natural 
historical and a chemical significance these classes 
according to naumann whose arrangement appears 
the best are hydrotes haloids silicides oxides of 
metals metals sulphurides pyrites glances and 
blendes and anthracides now we find — that the 
hydrolytes are all compounds such as are commonly 
termed salts — that the haloids are many of them 
already called spars as calc spar heavy spar iron 
spar zinc spar — that the silicides the most nume 
rous and difficult class are denoted for the most part 
by single words many of which end hi ite— that the 
other classes or subclasses oxides pyrites glances 
and blendes have commonl been so termed as red 
iron oxide iron pyrites zinc blende — vrtiile pure 
metals have usually had the adjective native prefixed 
as native gold native copper these obvious fea 
tures of the current names appear to afford us a basis 
for a systematic nomenclature the salts and spars 
might all have the word salt or spar included in their 
name as natron salt glauber salt rock salt calc 
spar bitter spar carbonate of lime and magnesia 
fluor spar phosphor spar phosphate of lime 
heavy spar celestine spar sulphate of strontian 
chwmic lead spar chromate of lead the silicides 
might all have the name constructed so as to be a

natrolite mesotype sommite nepheline pistacite 
epidote from this rule might be excepted the gems 
as topaz emerald corundum which might retain

tungstic iron oxide usually called tungstate of iron 
arsenical iron pyrites mispickel tetrahedral cop

ally if tye were to select among tlie synonyms as is 
proposed above in the case of glauber salt bitter spar 
sommite pistacite natrolite hence it might be 
adopted withfiit serious inconvenience it would make 
the name convey information respecting the place of 
the mineral in the system and imposing this con 
dition would limit the extreme caprice both as to 
origin and form which has hitherto been indulged in 
imposing mineralogical names 

the principle of a mineralogical nomenclature de 
termined by the place of the species in the system lias 
been recognized by mr beudant as well as mr mohs 
the former writer has proposed that we should say 
carbonate cauaire carbonate witherite sulphate 
couperose silicate stilbite silicate chabasie and so on 
but these are names in which tlie part added for the 
sake of uhe system is not incorporated with the com 
mon name and would hardly make its way into com 
mon use 

we have already noticed mr mohs’s designations 
for two of the systems of crystallization the pyra 
midal and the prismatic as not characteristic if it 
were thought advisable to reform such a defect this 
might be done by calling them the square pyramidal 
and the oblong prismatic which terms while they ex 
pressed the real distinction of the systems would te 
intelligible at once to those acquainted with the mohs 
ian terminology ° 

i will mention another suggestion respecting the 
introduction of an improvement in scientific language 
the term depolarization was introduced because it 
was believed that the effect of certain crystals when 
polarized light was incident upon them in certain posi 
tions was to destroy the peculiarity which polarization 
had produced but it is now well known that the 
effect of the second crystal in general is to divide the 
polarized ray of light into two rays polarized in dif 
ferent planes stih this effect is often spoken of as 
depolarization no better term having been yet devised 
i have proposed and used the term dipolarization 



the language qf science 

which well expresses whet tae place and so nearly 
resembles the elcter word that it must sound fanflliar 
to those already acquainted with writings on this 
subject 

i may mention one term in another department of 
literature which it appeal’s desirable to reform in the 
same manner tjje theory of the fine arts or the 
philosophy which speculates concerning what is beau 
tiful in painting sculpture or architecture and other 
arts often requires to be spoken of in a single word 
baumgarten and other german writers have termed 
this province of speculation esthetics alaodvccroal to 
perceive being a word which appeared to them fit to 
designate the perception of beautyin particular since 
however esthetics would naturally denote the doctrine 
of perception in general since this doctrine requires 
a name since the term aesthetics has actually been 
applied to it by other german writers as kant and 
since the essential point in the philosophy now spoken 
of is that it attends to beauty— it appears desirable 
to change this name in pursuance of the maxim now 
before us i should propose the term callcesthetics or 
rather in agreement with what was said in page 
callwstjtetic the science of the perception of beauty

i botany 

the nomenclature of botany as rescued from confu 
sion by linnaeus has in modern times been in some 
danger of relapsing into disorder or becoming intoler 
ably extensive in consequence of the multiplication of 
genera by the separation of one old genus into several 
new ones find thejike subdivisions of the higher groups 
as subclasses and classes this inconvenience and the 
origin of it have been so ’ ell pointed out by mr g 
ben t ham that i shall venture to adopt his judgment 
as an aphorism and give his reasons for it 

aphorism xxiii 

it is of the greatest importance that the groups which 
give their substantive names to every included species should 
remain large 

it will be recollected that according to the linnaean 
nomenclature the genus is marked by a substantive as 
rosa and the species designated by an adjective added 
to this substantive us rosa a ipina while the natu 
ral orders are described by adjectives taken substan 
tively as llosacece but this rule though it has been 
universally assented to in theory has often been devi 
ated from in practice the number of known species 
having much increased and the language of linnaeus 
and the principles of jussieu having much augmented 
the facilities for the study of affinities botanists have 
become aware that the species of a genus and the genera 
of an order can be collected into intermediate groups 


i linncean society proceedings vol ii p june 




further illustrations etc 


 


as natural and as well defined athe genera and orders 
themselves and frames are required for these subordi 
nate groups as much as for the genera and orders 

no two courses have been followed in providing 
names for these subordinate groups 

 the original genera considering the case of genera 
in the first place have been preserved if well founded 
and the lower groups have been called subgenera sec 
tions subsections divisions c and the original names 
of the genera have been maintained for the purpose of 
nomenclature in order to retain a convenient and stable 
language but when these subordinate groups are so 
well defined and so natural that except for the conve 
nience of language they might bq made good genera 
there are given also to these subordinate groups sub 
stantive or substantivelytaken adjective n aides when 
these subordinate groups arfc less defined or less natural 
either no names at all are given and they are distin 
guished by figures or signs such as or § § 
c or there are given them mere adjective names 

or to regard these intermecfiate groups between 
species and the original genera as so many independent 
genera and to give them substantive names to be used 
in ordinary botanical nomenclature 

now the second course is that which has produced 
the intolerable multiplication of genera in modern 
times and the first course is the only one which can 
save botanical nomenclature from replunging into the 
chaos in which linn am s found it it was strongly ad 
vocated by the elder de candolle although in the 
latter years of his life seeing how general was the dis 
position to convert his subgenera and sections into 
genera he himself more or less gave in to the general 
practice the same principle was adopted by end 
lichen but he again was disposed to go far in giving 
substantive names to purely technical or illdefined 
subsections of genera 

the multiplication of genera has been much too 
common botanists have a natural pride in establish 
ing new genera or orders aifd besides this it is felt 
how useful it is in the study of affinities to define and 



 further illustrations concerning 

name all natural groups in every grade however nume 
rous they may be and m the immeilse variety of lan 
guage it i£ found easy to coin names indefinitely 

but the arguments on the other side mudfi pre 
ponderate in attempting to introduce all these new 
names into ordinary botanical language the memory is 
taxed beyond the capabilities of any mind and the ori 
ginal and legitimate object of the linnsean nomencla 
ture is wholly lost sight of in a purely scientific view 
it matters little if the orders are converted into classes 
or alliances the genera into orders and the sections 
or subsections into genera their relative importance 
does not depend on the names given to them but on 
their height in the t scale of comprehensiveness but 
for language the great implement without which sci 
ence cannot work it is of the greatest importance as our 
aphorism declares jhat the groups which give their 
substantive names to every species which they include 
should remain large if independently of the inevit 
able increase of genera by new discoveries such old 
ones as ficus begonia arum erica c are divided 
into io or independent genera with names 
and characters which are to be recollected before any 
one species can be spoken of — if genera are to be 
reckoned by tens of thousands instead of by thousands 
— the range of any individual botanist will be limited 
to a small portion of the whole field of the sciences 

and in like manner with regard to orders so long 
as the number of orders can be kept within or not 
much beyond a couple of hundred it may reasonably 
be expected that a botanist of ordinary capacity shall 
obtain a sufficient general idea of their nature and cha 
racters to call them at any time individually to his mind 
for the purpose of comparison but if we double the 
number of orders all is cqnfusion 

the inevitable confusion and the necessity of main 
taining in some way the larger groups have been per 
ceived by those even who have gone the furthest in 
lowering the scale of orders and genera as a remedy 
for this confusion they propose to erect the old genera 
into independent orders and the old orders into classes 



the language of science 

or divisions this isbut wi ih complete resumption 
of the old principles without the advantage of the old 
nomenclature 

and it will not be asserted with regard to these new 
genera formed by cutting up the old ones that the new 
group is better defined than the group above it on he 
contrary it is frequently less so it is not pretended 
that urostigma or phannacosyce new genera formed 
out of the old genus ficus are better defined than the 
genus ficus or that the new genera which have lately 
been cut out of the old genus begonia form more natu 
ral groups than begonia itself does the principle 
which seems to be adopted in such subdivisions of old 
genera is this that the lowest definable group above a 
species is a genus if we were to go a step further 
every species becomes a genus with a substantive name 

it ought always to be recollected that though the 
analytical process carried to the uttermost and separat 
ing groups by observation of differences is necessary for 
the purpose of ascertaining the facti upon which botany 
or any other classiticatory science is based it is a judi 
cious synthesis alone associating individuals by the ties 
of language which can enable the human mind to take 
a comprehensive view of these facts to deduce from 
them the principles of the science or to communicate 
to others either facts or principles 

 comparative anatomy 

the language of botany as framed by linnaeus and 
regulated by his canons is still the most notable and 
successful example of scientific terminology which has 
obtained general reception among naturalists but the 
language of anatomy and especially of the compara 
tive anatomy of the skeleton has of late been an object 
of great attention to physiologists and especially to 
mr owen and the collection of terms which he has 
proposed are selected with so much thought and care 
that they may minister valuable lessons to us in this 
£art w of our subject 

there is at first sight this broad difference between 
the descriptive language of botany and of comparative 



 further illustrations concerning 


anatomy that in tlfe formed science we have com 
paratively t few parts to describe calyx corolla stamen 
pistil pericarp seed fee while each of these parts is 
susceptible of many forms for describing which with 
precision many terms must be provided in comparative 
anatomy on the other hand the skeletons of many ani 
mals are to be regarded as modifications of a common 
type and the terms by which their parts are described 
are to mark this community of type the terminology 
of botany has for its object description the language 
of comparative anatomy must have for its basis mor 
phology accordingly mr owen’s terms arc selected 
so as to express the analogies or as he calls them the 
homologies of the skeleton those parts of the skeleton 
being termed horruologues which have the same place in 
the general type and therefore ought to have the same 
name 

yet this distinction of the basis of botanical and 
anatomical terminology is not to be pushed too far 
the primary definitions in botany as given by lin 
naeus are founded on morphological views and imply 
a general type of the structure of plants these are his 
definitions phil bot art 

calyx cortex plantae in fructificaiione praesens 

corolla liber plantae in flora praesens 

stamen yiscus pro pollinis praeparatione 

pistillum yiscus fructui adherens pro pollinis re 
ccptione 

pericarpium yisgus gravidum seminibus quae ma 
tura dimittit 

but in what follows these leading definitions the 
terms are descriptive merely now in comparative 
anatomy an important object of terms is to express 
what part of the type each bone represents — to answer 
the question what is it before we proceed assuming 
that we know what it is to describe its shape the 
difficulty of this previous question is very great when 
we come to r the bones of the head and when we assume 
is morphology leads us to do that the heads of all 
vertebrated animals including even fishes are com 
posed of homologous bones and as i have already 



the language science 

said in the history b xtii cj speaking of anijnal 
morphology the lest physiologists are now agreed that 
the heads of vertebrates may be resolved info a series 
of vertebrae homologically repeated and modified in 
different animals this doctrine has been gradually 
making its way among anatomists through a great 
variety of views respecting details and hence with 
great discrepancies in the language by which it has 
been expressed mr owen has proposed a complete 
series of terms for the bones of the head of all verte 
brates and these names are supported by reasons which 
are full of interest and instruction to the physiologist 
on account of the comprehensive and precise knowledge 
of comparative osteology which they involve but they 
are also as i have said interesting and instinctive to 
us as exemplifying the reasons which may be given for 
the adoption of words in scidhtific language the rea 
sons thus given agree with several of the aphorisms 
which i have laid down and may perhaps suggest a 
few others mr owen has done irye the great honour 
to quote with approval some of these aphorisms the 
terms which he has proposed belong as i have already 
said to the terminology not to the nomenclature of 
zoology in the jatter subject the nomenclature the 
names of species the binary nomenclature established 
by linnaeus remains in its principle unshaken simple 
and sufficient 

j shrill best derive from mr owen’s labours and re 
flexions some of the instruction whitfh they supply with 
reference to the language of science by making re 
marks on his terminology with reference to such apho 
risms as i have propounded on the subject and others 
of a like kind 

mr owen in his homologies of the vertebrate 
skeleton has given in a tabular form his views of 
the homology of the bones of the head of vertebrates 
and the names which he consequently proposes for each 
bone with the synonyms as they occur in the writings 
of some of the most celebrated anatomical philosophers 
olivier geoffroy hallmann meckel and wagner 

 agassiz and soemmering and he has added to this 
table his ieasqns for dissenting from his predecessor 



rg further illustrations concerning 


to the extent tg which ije has done so he has done 
this he says only where nature seemed clearly to re 
fuse her sanction to them acting upon the maxim our 
aphorism x that new terms and changes of terms 
which are not needed in order to express truth are to 
be‘a voided the illustrations which i have there given 
however of this maxim apply rather to the changes in 
nomenclature than in terminology and though many 
considerations apply equally to these two subjects there 
are some points in which the reasons differ in the two 
cases especially in this point — the names both of 
genera and of species in a system of nomenclature may 
be derived from casual or arbitrary circumstances as i 
have said in aphorirm xiii but the terms of a scien 
tific terminology flight to cohere as a system and there 
fore should not commonly be derived from anything 
casual or arbitrary but from some analogy or con 
nexion hence it seems unadvisable to apply to bones 
terms derived from the names of persons as ossa wor 
miana or even frpm an accident in anatomical his 
tory as os innominatum 

it is further desirable that in establishing such a 
terminology each bone should be designated by a single 
word and not by a descriptive phpase consisting of 
substantive and adjective on this ground mr owen 
proposes presphenoid for spthenoide anterieur so also 
prefrontal is preferred to anterior frontal and post 
frontal to posterior frontal and the reason which lie 
gives for this is worthy of being stated as an apho 
rism among those which should regulate this subject 
i shall therefore state it thus 

aphorism xxiy 

it is advisable to substitute definite single names for de 
scriptive phrases as better instruments of thought 

it will be recollected by the reader that in the case of 
the linmean reform of the botanical nomenclature of 
species this was one of the great improvements which 
was introduced 

again some of the first of the terms which mr owen 
proposes illustrate and confirm by their manifest claim 



the language ob science t 

to acceptance a maxim which re •stated as aphorism 
xxii namely 

whe alterations in technical terms become neces 
sary it is desirable that the new term should contain 
in its form some memorial of the old one 

thus for ‘ basil aire which cuvier exclusively applies 
to the ‘pars basilaris ’ of the occiput and which geof 
froy as exclusively applies in birds to the ‘pars basi 
laris’ of the sphenoid mr owen substitutes the term 
basioccipital 

again for the term ‘ suroccipital’ of geoffroy mr 
owen proposes paroccipital to avoid confusion and false 
suggestion and with reference to this word he makes 
a remark in agreement with what ve have said in the 
discussion of aphorism xxi namely f that tlx combi 
nation of different languages in the derivation of words 
though to be avoided in gencil is in some cases admis 
sible he says ‘ if the purists who are distressed by 
such harmless hybrids as “mineralogy” “terminology” 
and “mammalogy” should protest against the com 
bination of the greek prefix to the latin noun i can 
only plead that servility to a particular source of the 
fluctuatingsounds of vocal language is a matter of taste 
and that it seems no unreasonable privilege to use such 
elements as the servants of thought and in the interests 
of science to combine them even though they come 
from different countries when the required duty is best 
and mst expeditiously performed by their combina 
tion’ 

so again we have illustrations of our aphorism xii 
that if terms are systematically good they are not to be 
rejected because they are etymologically inaccurate in 
reference to that bone of the skull which has commonly 
been called vomer tlie ploughshare a term which geof 
froy rejected but which mr owen retains he says 
‘when geoffroy was induced to reject the term vomer 
as being applicable only to the peculiar form of the bone 
in a small portion of the vertebrata he appeafs not to 
have considered that the old term in its wider applica 
tion would be used without reference to its primary 
allusion to the ploughshare ad that becoming as it 
novojtg “ 



 further illustrations concerning 


lias a purely arbitrary erm it is superior and prefer 
able to any partially descriptive one’ 

another condition which i have mentioned t in aph 
orism xx as valuable in technical terms is that they 
should be susceptible of such grammatical relations as 
their scientific use requires 

this is in fact one of the grounds of the aphorism 
which we have already borrowed from mr owen that 
we are to prefer single substantives to descriptive 
phrases for from such substantives we can derive 
adjectives and other forms and thus the term becomes 
as mr owen says a better instrument of thought 
hence he most consistently mentions it as a recom 
mendation of his system of names that by them the 
results of a long series of investigations into the spe 
cial homologies of the bones of the head are expressed 
in simple mid definite tefrns capable of every requisite 
inflection to express the proportion of the parts 

i may also in reference to this same passage in mr 
owen’s appeal in behalf of his terminology repeat what 
i have said under aphorism x that the persons who 
may most properly propose new scientific terms are those 
who have much new knowledge to communicate so 
that the vehicle is commended to general reception by 
the value of what it contains it is only to eminent dis 
coverers and profound philosophers that the authority 
is conceded of introducing a new system of terms just 
as it is only the highest authority in the state which has 
the power of quitting a new coinage into circulation 
the long series of investigations of which the results are 
contained in mr owen’s table of synonyms and the phi 
losophical spirit of his generalizations entitles him to a 
most respectful hearing when he appeals to the proces 
sors and demonstrators of human anatomy for an un 
biassed consideration of the advantages of the terms 
proposed by him as likely to remedy the conflicting 
and unsettled synonymy which has hitherto pervaded 
the subject 

there is another rpmark which is suggested by the 
works on comparative anatomy which i am now con 
sidering i have said in various places that technical 



the language of science 


 


terms are a necessary condition f tlie progress of a sot 
ence but we may say much more than this and the 
remark i£ so important that it deserves to be stated as 
one of our aphorisms as follows 

aphorism xxv 

in an advanced science the history of the language of 
the science is the history of the science itself 

 have already stated in previous aphorisms viii 
and xl that terms must be constructed so as to 
be fitted to enunciate general propositions and that 
terms which imply theoretical views fire admissible for 
this purpose and hence it happens that the history of 
terms in any science which has gone through several 
speculative stages is really tfie history of the gene 
ralizations and theories which have had currency 
among the cultivators of the science 

this appears in comparative anatomy from wliat we 
have been saying the recent progress of that science 
is involved in the rise and currency of the terms which 
have been used by the anatomists whose synonyms mr 
owen has to discuss and the reasons for selecting among 
these or inventing others include those truths and gene 
ralizations which are the important recent steps of the 
science the terms which are given by mr owen in his 
tabl to denote the bones of the head are good terms if 
they are good terms because their adoption and use is 
the only complete way of expressing the truths of homo 
logy namely of that special homology according to 
which all vertebrate skeletons are referred to the human 
skeleton as their type and have their parts designated 
accordingly 

but further there is another kind of homology which 
mr owen calls general homology according to which 
the primary type of a vertebrate animal is merely a series 
of vertebral and all limbs and other appendages are 
only developernents of the parts of nc or another of the 
verttibriie and in order to express this view and in 
 oportion as the doctrine has bcome current amongst

 further illustrations concerning 

anatomists the parts ofrvertebne haye been described by 
terms of t a degree of generality which admit of such an 
interpretation and here also mr owen jias pro 
posed a terminology for the parts of the vertebrae which 
seems to convey more systematically and comprehen 
sively than those of preceding writers the truths to 
which they have been tending each vertebra is com 
posed of a centrum neurapojihysis parapophysis pleura 
pojdiysis lmmaphyds neural spine and htvrnal spine 
with certain exogenous parts 

the opinion that the head as well as the other parts 
of the frame of vertebrates is composed of vertebra is 
now generally accepted among philosophical anatomists 
in the history hist i s b xvii c sect t i have 
mentioned this® opinion as proposed by some writers 
and i have stated that oken in published a i pro 
gram’ on the signification of the bones of the skull in 
which hj maintained that these bones are equivalent to 
four vertebra while meckel spix and geoffrey took 
views somewhat different cuvier and agassiz opposed 
this doctrine but mr owen has in his archetype and 
homologies of the vertebrate skeleton accepted 
the views of oken and argued at length r against the 
objections of cuvier and also those of mr agassiz 
as t have noted in the last edition of the history of 
the inductive sciences b xvii c he gives a table in 
which the bones of the head are resolved into four ver 
tebra which he terms the occipital parietal u frontal 
and nasal vertebra respectively the neural arches of 
which agree with what oken called the ear vertebra the 
jawvertebra the eye vertebra andthenosevertebra 

besides these doctrines of special homology by which 
the bones of all vertebrates are referred to their corre 
sponding bones in the human skeleton and of general 
homology by which the bones are referred to the parts 
of vertebra which they represent mr owen treats of 
serial homology the recognition of the same elements 
throughout the series of segments of the same skeleton 
as when we shew in what manner the arms correspond 
to the legs and thus he says in the head also the 
basioccipital basisphenoid presphertoid and vomer are

homotypes with the centrums pf succeeding verte 
 me the exoccipitals alisphenoids orbitosphenoids 
md prefrontals are liomotypes with the neurflpaph yses 
of all ftie succeeding vertebrae the paroccipitals 
mactoids and postfrontals with the transverse processes 
of all the succeeding vertebrae and so on perhajjs 
these examples may exemplify sufficiently for the general 
reader both mr owen’s terminology and the intimate 
manner in which it is connected with the widest gene 
ralizations to which anatomical philosophy has yet been 
led 

the same doctrine that the history of the language 
of a science is the history of the science appears also 
in the recent progress of chemistry but we shall be 
better able to illustrate our aphoristr in this case by 
putting forward previously one or two other aphorisms 
bearing upon the history of tiat science 

aphorism xx yi 

in the terminology of science it may be necessary to 
employ letters numbers and algebraical symbols 

 mineralogy 

t have already aid in aphorism xv that sym 
bols have been found requisite as a part of the ter 
minology of mineralogy the names proposed by 
flaiiy borrowed from the crystalline laws were so 
inadequate and unsystematic that they could not be 
retained he himself proposed a ifotatitn for crystal 
line forms founded upon liis principle of the deriva 
tion of such forms from a primitive form by decre 
ments on its edges or its angles to denote this deri 
vation he took the first letters of the three syllables to 
mark the faces of the prim itive form p m t the 
vowels a e i to mark the angles the consonants 
b c i c to mark the edges and numerical expo 
nents annexed in various positions to these letters 
represented the law and manner of derivation tlius 

• 

•when vhe primitive form was a cube b represented 
uhe result of a derivation by a decrement of one row

on an edge that ig a rhoihbic octahedron and b p 
represented the combination of this octahedron with 
the primitive cube in this way the pentagonal 
dodecahedron produced by decrements of to 
on half the edges of the cube was represented by 

b g g 

not only however was the hypothesis of primitive 
forms and decrements untenable but this notation 
was too unsystematic to stand long and when weiss 
and mohs established the distinction of systems of 
crystallography they naturally founded upon that dis 
tinction a notation for crystalline forms mohs had 
several followers but his algebraical notation so bar 
barously violated all algebraical meaning that it was 
not likely to last thus from a primitive rhombo 
liedron which ho designated by i he derived by a 
certain process a series of other rhombohedrons which 
lie denoted by b b — c and then by 
another mode of t derivation from them he obtained 
forms which he marked as r i “ c in 
doing this he used the algebraical marks of addition 
and involution without the smallest ground besides 
many other proposals no less transgressing mathe 
matical analogy and simplicity 

but this notation might easily suggest a better if 
w r e take a primitive form we can generally by two 
steps of derivation each capable of numerical measure 
obtain any possible face and therefore any crystalline 
form bounded by such faces hence all that we need 
indicate in our crystalline laws is the primitive form 
and two numerical exponents and rejecting all super 
fluity in our symbols instead of b we might 
write b nearly of this kind is the notation of 
naumann the systems of crystallization the octa 
hedral or tcssular the rhombic and the prismatic are 
marked by the letters b p and from these are 
derived by certain laws such symbols as 
oi r if

which have their definite signification flowing from 
the rules of the notation 

but professor miller who has treated tlfle subject 
of crystallography in the most genera and symme 
trical manner adopts the plan of marking each crys 
talline plane by three numerical indices thus in the 
octahedral system the cube is the octahedron 
is hi the rhombic dodecahedron is on the 
pentagonal dodecahedron is where r indi 
cates that the form is not holohedral but hernihedral 
only half the number of faces being taken which the 
law of derivation would give this system is the 
most mathematically consistent and affords the best 
means of calculation as professor miller has shown 
but there appears to be in it this depet thaj though 
an essential part of the scheme is the division of crys 
talline forms into systems — the octahedral pyra 
midal lthombohedral and prismatic — thiij division 
does not at all appear in the notation 

but whatever be the notation yhich the crystal 
lographer adopts it is evident that he must employ 
some notation and that without it he will be unable 
to express the l‘ urns and relations of forms with which 
he has to deal 

 chemistry 

the same has long been the case in chemistry 
as i have stated elsewhere the chemical nomencla 
ture of the oxygen theory was for a time very useful 
and effective but yet it had defeats viich could not 
be overlooked as i have already stated under apho 
rism ii the relations of elements were too nume 
rous and their numerical properties too important to 
unexpressed by terminations and other modifications 
of words thus the compounds of nitrogen and 
oxygen are the protoxide the deutoxide nitrous 
acid peroxide of nitrogen nitric acid the sys 
tematic nomenclature here even thus loosely extended 
does not express our knowledge and th atomic 
theory when established brought to view numerical

relations which it was vevy important to keep in 
sight if n represents nitrogen and oxygen the 
compounds of the two elements just mentioned might 
be denoted by n f n n n 
and by adopting a letter for each of the elementary 
substances all the combinations of them might be ex 
pressed in this manner 

but in chemistry there are different orders of com 
bination a salt for instance is a compound of a 
base and an acid each of which is already compound 
if fe be iron and g be carbon fe will be the pro 
toxide of iron and g o will be carbonic acid and 
the carbonate of iron more properly carbonate of 
protoxide of iron may be represented by 
 fe o co 

where the brackets indicate the first stage of compo 
sition 

but these brackets and signs of addition in complex 
cases would cumber the page in an inconvenient de 
gree and oxygen is of such very wide occurrence that 
it seems desirable to abridge the notation so far as it 
is concerned hence berzelius proposed that in the 
first stage of composition the oxygen should be ex 
pressed by dots over the letter and thus the car 
bonate of iron would be fe g but berzelius 
further introduced into his notation indexes such as 
in algebra denote involution to the square cube c 
thus gu being copper the sulphate of copper io repre 
sented by is ij gu this notation when first proposed 
was strongly condemned by english chemists and 
berzelius’s reply to them may be taken as stating the 
reasons in favour of such notation he says ‘we 
answer to the opponents that undoubtedly the mat 
ter may be looked at in various lights the use 
of formulae has always for a person who has not 
accustomed himself to them something repulsive but 
this is esy to overcome i agree with my opponent

who says that nothing can be uierstood in a formula 
which cannot beexpressed in words and that if the 
words express it as easily as the formula the use of 
the latter would be a folly but there are cases in 
which this is not so in which the formula says in a 
glance what it would take many lines to express in 
words and in which the expression of the formula is 
clearer and more easily apprehended by the reader 
than the longer description in words let us examine 
such a formula and compare it with the equivalent 
description in words take for example crystallized 
sulphate of copper of which the formula is 

cus iozt 

now this formula expresses the following proposi 
tions 

‘that the salt consists c£ one atom of copperoxide 
combined with atoms of sulphuric acid and with 
atoms of water that the copperoxide contains two 
atoms of oxygen and that the sulphuric acid contains 
 atoms of oxygen for one atom of sulphur that its 
oxygen is three times as much as that of the oxide 
and that the number of atoms of oxygen in the acid is 
 and ftiat the number of atoms of oxygen in the 
water is that is times the number in the oxide 
and that finally the salt contains of simple atoms 
oojper sulphur hydrogen and oxygen 

 c since so uch is expressed in this brief formula 
how very long would the explanation be for a more 
composite body for example jflum for which the 
formula is 

k s al js a ip 

it would take half a page to express all which this 
formula contains 

‘ perhaps it may be objected that it is seldom that 
any one wants to know all this at once but it might 
reasonably be said in reply that the peculiar value of 
the formula consists in this that it contains answers 
•to jill the questions which can be asked with regard 
to the composition of the body 



 further illustrations concerning 

‘ eut these formujae have also another application 
of vhich i have sometimes had occasion to make use 
experiments sometimes bring before us combinations 
which cannot be foreseen from the nomenclature and 
for which it is not always easy to find a consistent 
and appropriate name in writing the formula may 
be applied instead of a name and the reader under 
stands it better than if one made a new name in 
my treatise upon the sulphuretted alkalies i found 
degrees of sulphurcombination for which nomen 
clature has no name i expressed them for example 
by ks ks at and i believed that every one un 
derstood what was thereby meant moreover i found 
another class of bodies in which an electronegative 
sulphuretted metal played the part of an acid with 
respect to an electropositive sulphuretted metal for 
which a whole new nomenclature was needed while 
yet it were not prudent to construct such a nomencla 
ture till more is known on the subject instead of 
new names i used formula for example 

 ex ass 

instead of saying the combination of atoms of sul 
phuret of arsenic containing atoms of sulphur 
with one atom of sulphuret of potassium kali with 
the least dose of sulphur’ 

berzelius goes on to say that the english chemists 
had found themselves unable to find any substitutes 
for his formula when they translated his papers 

our english ‘ehcfiiists have not generally adopted 
the notation of oxygen by dots but have employed 
commas or full stops and symbols or and f to 
denote various degrees of union and numerical in 
dices tims the double sulphate of copper and potash 
is cu s a ko m a 

what has been said is applicable maiidy to inorganic 
bodies as salts and minerals l in these bodies there 
is at least according to the views of many intelligent 
chemists a binary plan of combination union taking 


 fownes’s qhemistry part ii 



the language jf science 

place between pairs of element§ and the compounds 
so produced again uniting tliem selves to other com 
pound bodies in the same manner thus in the above 
example copper and oxygen combine into oxide of 
copper potassium and oxygen into potash sulphur 
and oxygen into sulphuric acid sulphuric acid in its 
turn combines both with oxide of copper and oxide 
of potassium generating a pair of salts which are 
capable of uniting to form the double compound 
cu s a ko so n 

the most complicated products of inorganic che 
mistry may be thus shown to be built up by this 
repeated pairing on the part of their constituents 
but with organic bodies the case remarkably differ 
ent no such arrangement can here be traced in 
sugar which is g v j n u or morphia whicli is 
c as n ivd c the elements tire as it were bound toge 
ther into a single whole which can enter into combi 
nation with other substances and be thence discharged 
with properties unaltered the elements not being 
obviously arranged in any subordinate groups hence 
the symbols for those substances are such as i have 
given above no marks of combination being used 

it is perhaps a consequence of this peculiarity that 
organic compounds are unstable in comparison witli 
inorganic in unorganic substances generally the ele 
ments are combined in such a way that the most 
powerful affiifities are satisfied and hence arises a 
state of very considerable permaneye and durabi 
lity but in an organic substance containing three 
or four elements there are often opposing affinities 
nearly balanced and when one of these tendencies by 
lomc accident obtains a preponderance and the equili 
brium is destroyed then the organic body breaks up 
into two or more new bodies of simpler and more per 
manent constitution 

there is another property of many organic sub 
stances which is called the law of tiubstitvjtion the 


 fownes’s chemistry p

hydrogen of tlie organic substance may often be re 
placed by chlorine bromine iodine or some other 
elements twithout the destruction of the primitive 
type or constitution of the compound so modified 
and this substitution may take place by several suc 
cessive steps giving rise to a series of substitution 
compounds which depart more and more in properties 
from the original substance this law also gives rise 
to a special notation thus a certain compound called 
dutch liquid has the elements c v ii cl but this sub 
stance is affected by chlorine cl in obedience to the 
law of substitution one and two equivalents of hy 
drogen being successively removed by the prolonged 
action of chlorine gas aided by sunshine the succes 
sive products may be thus written

perhaps’ at a future period chemical symbols and 
especially those of organic bodies may be made more 
systematic and more significant than they at present 
are 


aniorism xxvii 

in using algebraical symbols as a part of scientific 
language violations of algebraical analogy are to be avoided 
but may be admitted when necessary 

as we mush m scientific language conform to ety 
mology so must we to algebra and as we are not to 
make ourselves the slaves of the former so also not to 
the latter hence we reject such crystallographical 
notation as that of mohs and in chemistry we use 
c rather than c which signify the square 
of c and the cube of but we may use as we have 
said both the comma and the sign of addition for 
chemical combination for the sake of brevity though 
both steps of combination are really addition

in a complex science which is in a state of transition 
capricious and detached derivations of terms are common 
hut are not satisfactory 

in this remark i have especial reference to chemis 
try in which the discoveries made especially in orga 
nic chemistry and the difficulty of reducing them to a 
system have broken up in several instances the old 
nomenclature without its being possible at present to 
construct a new set of terms systematically connected 
hence it has come to pass that chemists jiave con 
structed words in a capricious and detached way as 
by taking fragments of wsrds and the like i shall 
give some examples of such derivations nd also of 
some attempts which have more of a systematic cha 
racter

words lave recently been formed by chemists by 
taking syllables from two or more different words

that vrj may be taken in its signification of matter to 
imply the radical of wine and he proposes that the

this notion of marking by the termination yl the

the discovery of such bset goes back to 
the substance formerly called prussiate of mercury 
being treated in a particular manner was ref olved into 
metallic mercury and cyanogen this substance cya 
nogen is according to the older nomenclature bicar 
buret of nitrogen but chemists are agreed that its 
most convenient name is cyanogen proposed by its 
discoverer gaylussac in t the importance 
of the discovery consists in this that this substance 
was the first compound body which was distinctly 
proved to enter into combination with elementary sub 
stances in a manner similar to that in which they 
combine with each other 

the truth of our aphorism xx y that in such a 
science as chemistry the history of th scientific nomen 
clature is the history of the science appears from this 
that the controversies with respect to chemical theories 
and their application take the form of objections to the 
common systematic names and proposals of new names 
instead thus a certain coinpound f of potassa sulphur 
hydrogen and oxygen may be regarded either as uy 
drosulphate of fotassa or as sulphide of potassium in 
solution according to different views in some cases 
indeed changes are made merely for the sake of clear 
ness instead of hydrochloric and hydrocyanic acid 
many french writers following thenard transpose the 
elements of these terms they speak of cdorhydric and 
cyanfyydric acfd by this means they avoid any ambi 
guity which might arise from tfea aasf of the prefix 
hydro which has sometimes been applied to compounds 
which contain water 

an incompleteness in chemical nomenclature was 
ftirther felt when it appeared from the properties of 
various substances that mere identity in chemical 
composition is not sufficient to produce identity of 
chemical character or properties the doctrine of

amylene caproylene naphthene eleene peramylene 
cetylene cerotylene melissine 

i will in the last place propound an aphorism 
which has already offered itself in considering the 
history of chemistry as having a special bearing upon 
that science but which may be regarded as the su 
preme md ultimate rule with regard to the language 
of science 


aphorism xxix 

in learning the meaning of scientific terms the history of 
science is our dictionary the steps of scientific induction are 
our definitions 

it is usual for unscientific readers to complain that 
the technical terms which they meet witli in books of 
science are not accompanied by plain definitions such as 
they can understand but such definitions cannot be 
given for definitions must consist of words and in 
the case of scientific terms must consist of words which • 
require again to be defined and so on without limjt 
elementary sukianes in chemistry for instance what 
are they the substances into which bodies can be 
analysed and by the junction of which they are com 
posed but wliat is analysis what is composition we 
have seen that it required long and laborious courses f 
experiment toanswer these questions and that finally 
the balance decided among rival answers and so it 
is in other cases in entering upon each science we 
come upon a new set of words and ho w are we to learn 


 millets chemistry ii

the language op science 

tlie meaning of this collection of fords in what gjjfej 
language shall itfbe explained in what terms shall rfe 
define these new expressions to this we afe compelled 
to reply that we cannot translate these terms into any 
ordinary or familiar language here as in all other 
branches of knowledge the meaning of words is tt be 
sought in the progress of thought it is only by going 
back through the successful researches of men respect 
ing the composition and demerits of bodies that we can 
learn in what sense such terms can be understood so as 
to convey real knowledge in order that they may have 
a meaning for us we must inquire what meaning they 
had in the minds of the authors of our disco verilind 
the same is the case in other subjects to take the in 
stance of morphology when the lyeginner js told that 
every group of animals may be reduced to an archetype 
he will seek for a definition f of archetype such a defi 
nition has lcn offered to this effect tlie archetype of 
a group of animals is a diagram embodying all the organ 
and parts which are found in the group in such a rela 
tive position as they would haveliad if none had at 
tained an excessive development but then we are led 
further to ask how are we in each case to become ac 
quaintednvith the diagram to know of what parts it 
consists and how they arc related and further 
what is the standard of excess it is by a wide 
examination of particular species and by several suc 
cessive generalizations of observed facts that we are led 
to a diagram of an animal form ptlatain kind for 
example a vertebrate and of the various ways exces 
sive and defective in which the parts may be developed 

this craving for definitions as we have already said 
arises in a great degree from the acquaintance with geo 
metry which most persons acquire at an early age 
the definitions of geometry are easily intelligible by a 
beginner because the idea of space of which they are 
modifications is clearly possessed without any special 
culture but this is not and cannot be the case in other 
sciences founded upon a wide gnd exact observation of
