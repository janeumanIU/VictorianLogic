preface 


the lectures comprised in the present volumes form 
the second and concluding portion of the biennial course 
on metaphysics and logic which was commenced by 
sir william hamilton on his election to the professorial 
chair in and repeated with but slight alterations 
till his decease in the appendix contains various 
papers composed for the most part during this period 
which though portions of their contents were publicly 
taught at least as early as were only to a very 
small extent incorporated into the text of the lectures 

the lectures on logic like those on metaphysics 
were chiefly composed during the session in which they 
were first delivered and the statements made 
in the preface to the previous volumes as regards the cir 
cumstances and manner of their composition are equally 
applicable to the present course in this as in the 
preceding series the author has largely availed himself 
of the labours of previous writers many of whom are 
but little known in this country to the works of the 
german logicians of the present century particularly to 
those of krug and esser these lectures are under espe 
cial obligations

preface 


ill the compilation of the appendix some responsi 
bility rests with the editors and a few words of explan 
ation may be necessary as regards the manner in which 
they have attempted to perform this portion of their task 
in publishing the papers of a deceased writer composed 
at various intervals during a long period of years and 
treating of difficult and controverted questions there are 
two opposite dangers to be guarded against on the 
one hand there is the danger of compromising the 
authors reputation by the publication of documents 
which his maturer judgment might not have sanctioned 
and on the other hand there is the danger of commit 
ting an opposite injury to him and to the public by 
withholding writings of interest and value had sir 
william hamilton at any period of his life published a 
systematic treatise on logic or had his projected new 
analytic of logical forms been left in a state at all 
approaching to completeness the editors might probably 
have obtained a criterion by which to distinguish between 
those speculations which would have received the final 
imprimatur of their author and those which would not 
in the absence of any such criterion they have thought 
it better to run the risk of giving too much than too 
little — to publish whatever appeared to have any philo 
sophical or historical interest without being influenced 
by its coincidence with their own opinions or by its 
coherence with other parts of the authors writings it 
is possible that among the papers thus published may 
be found some which are to be considered rather as 
experimental exercises than as approved results but no 


preface 


ix 


papers have been intentionally omitted except such as 
were either too fragmentary to be intelligible or mani 
festly imperfect sketches of what has been published 
here or elsewhere in a more matured form 

the notes in these as in the previous volumes are 
divided into three classes those printed from the 
manuscript of the lectures appear without any dis 
tinctive mark those supplied from the author’s com 
monplacebook and other papers are enclosed within 
square brackets without signature and those added by 
the editors are marked by the signature “ ed” these 
last as in the lectures on metaphysics are chiehy con 
fined to occasional explanations of the text and verifica 
tions of references 

in conclusion the editors desire to express their ac 
knowledgments to those friends from whom they have 
received assistance in tracing the numerous quotations 
and allusions scattered through these and the preceding 
volumes in particular their thanks are due to hubert 
hamilton esq whose researches amodg his father’s books 
and papers have supplied them with many valuable ma 
terials and to h w chandler esq fellow of pem 
broke college oxford who has aided them from the 
resources of a philosophical learning cognate in many 
respects to that of sir william hamilton himself

introduction 

logic — i its definition 

gentlemen — we are now about to enter on the con lect 

sideration of one of the most important branches of l 

mental philosophy — the science which is conversant 
about the laws of thought but before commencing “ 
the discussion i would premise a w r ord in regard to to°h°ran 
the mode in which it ought to be conducted with a duct “ i 
view to your information and improvement the end of 
great end which every instructor ought to propose m “ lruc “ un 
in the communication of a science is to afford the 
student clear and distinct notions of its several parts 
of their relations to each other and to the whole of 
which they are the constituents for unless he ac 
complish this it is of comparatively little moment 
that his information be in itself either new or impor 
tant for of what consequence are all the qualities of 
a doctrine if that doctrine be not communicated — 
and communicated it is not if it be not understood 

but in the communication of a doctrine the me method of

thods to be followed by an instructor who writes 
and by an instructor who speaks are not the same 
they are in fact to a certain extent necessarily dif 
ferent for while the reader of the one can always 
be referred back or forward can always compare one 
part of a book with another and can always meditate 
at leisure on each step of the evolution the hearer 
of the other on the contrary must at every moment 
be prepared by what has preceded to comprehend at 
once what is to ensue the oral instructor has thus 
a much more arduous problem to solve in accom 
plishing the end which he proposes for if on the 
one hand he avoid obscurity by communicating only 
what can easily be understood as isolated fragments 
he is intelligible only because he communicates no 
thing worth learning and if on the other he be 
unintelligible in proportion as his doctrine is concate 
nated and systematic he equally fails in his attempt 
for as in the one case there is nothing to teach so 
in the other there is nothing taught it is therefore 
evident that the oral instructor must accommodate his 
mode of teaching to the circumstances under which 
he acts he must endeavour to make his audience 
fully understand each step of his movement before 
another is attempted and he must prepare them for 
details by a previous survey of generals in short 
what follows should always be seen to evolve itself 
out of what precedes it is in consequence of this 
condition of oral instruction that where the develop 
ment of a systematic doctrine is attempted in a course 
of lectures it is usual for the lecturer to facilitate the 
labour to his pupils and himself by exhibiting in a 
manual or textbook the order of his doctrine and a 
summary of its contents as i have not been able to

prepare this useful subsidiary i shall endeavour as lect 
far as possible to supply its want i shall in the first — — 
place endeavour always to present you with a general mcthsif 
statement of every doctrine to be explained before prelecton 
descending to the details of explanation and in order 
that you may be insured in distincter and more com 
prehensive notions i shall where it is possible com 
prise the general statements in propositions or para 
graphs which i shall slowly dictate to you in order 
that they may be fully taken down in writing this 
being done i shall proceed to analyse these proposi 
tions or paragraphs and to explain their clauses in 
detail this i may observe is the method followed 
in those countries where instruction by prelection is 
turned to the best account — it is the one prevalent 
on the continent more especially in the universities 
of germany and holland 

in pursuance of this plan i at once commence by 
giving you as the first proposition or paragraph the 
following i may notice however by parenthesis 
that as we may have sometimes occasion to refer 
articulately to these propositions it would be proper 
for you to distinguish them by sign and number 

the first paragraph then is this — 

it i a system of logical instruction consists par t 
of two parts — ° of an introduction to the system of 
science ° of a body of doctrine constituting fe c c ° u 
the science itself 

these of course are to be considered in their order 


tf ii the introduction to logic should afford p ar ii 

 the intro 

answers to the following questions — i what is duction to 


 


lectures on logic 


logic ii what is its value iii what are 
its divisions iv what is its history and 
v what is its bibliography that is what are 
the best books upon the subject 

in regard to the first of these questions it is evi 
dent that its answer is given in a definition of logic 
i therefore dictate to you the third paragraph 

p sr ni if iii what is logic answer — logic is the 

tioof science of the laws of thought as thought 

logic 

fipii this definition however cannot be understood 
without an articulate exposition of its several parts 
i therefore proceed to this analysis and explanation 
and shall consider it under the three following heads 
in the first i shall consider the meaning and history 
and synonyms of the word logic in the second i 
shall consider the genus of logic that is explain 
why it is defined as a science in the third i 
shall consider the object matter of logic that is 
explain to you what is meant by saying that it is con 
versant about the laws of thought as thought 
l thcwoni first then in regard to the signification of the 
huwry ’ word logic you are aware is a greek word xoyioj 
and koyucrj like ypappatticrj prjtoplicj troirjtiicq ia 
keicnkt i need hardly tell you is an adjective one 
or other of the substantives imanjpr science riyyt 
art or npaypareca study or rather matter of study 
being understood the term xoyucq in this special 
signification and as distinctly marking out a parti 
cular science is not so old as the constitution of that 
ariatotie bcience itself aristotle did not designate by the 
terra oyticr the science whose doctrine he first fully

developed he uses indeed the adjective xoyocos in lect 
various combinations with other substantives thus 
i find in his physics koyucr an opla a — in his rhetoric 
koyucal svcryepdaif — in his metaphysics xoyikd 
airoseifets — in liis posterior analytics evia koyuca s 
— in his topics koyucov npofikyp a‘ he likewise not 
unfrequently makes use of the adverb koyisax by 
whom the term koyucr was first applied as the word 
expressive of the science does not appear boethius ancient 
who flourished at the close of the fifth and commence 
ment of the sixth century says in his commentary 
on the topics of cicero v that the name of logic was 
first given by the ancient peripatetics in the works of 
alexander of aplirodisias the oldest commentator we alexander 
possess on the works of aristotle he flourished to diae 
wards the end of the second century the term 
koyucr both absolutely and in combination with 
npaypareia c is frequently employed and the 
word is familiar in the writings of all the subsequent 
aristotelians previously however to alexander it cicero 
is evident that koyucr had become a common designa 
tion of the science for it is once and again thus

applied by cicero® so much for the history of the 
word logic in so far as regards its introduction and 
earlier employment we have now to consider its 
derivation and meaning 

it is derived from xoyos and it had primarily the 
same latitude and variety of signification as its origi 
nal what then did xoyos signify in greek this 
word had a twofold meaning it denoted both thought 
and its expression it was equivalent both to the ratio 
and to the oratio of the latins the greeks in order 
to obviate the ambiguity thus arising from the con 
fusion of two different things under one expression 
were compelled to add a differential epithet to the 
common term aristotle to contradistinguish xoyos 
meaning thought from xoyo meaning speech calls 
the former top ec rco — rov ip rf ipvxf — that unthin — 
that in the mind and the latter top cfco — that with 
out the same distinction came subsequently to be 
expressed by the xoyos ipsiddetos for thought the 
verbum mentis and by xoyos trpotyopucbs for lan 
guage the verbum oris y it was necessary to give you 
this account of the ambiguity of the word xoyos 
because the same passed into its derivative xoyuaj 
and it also was necessary that you should be made 
aware of the ambiguity in the name of the science 
because this again exerted an influence on the views 
adopted in regard to the objectmatter of the science

but what it may be asked was the appellation of lect 
the science before it had obtained the name of logic f — — 
for as i have said the doctrine had been discrimi uomtftbc 
nated and even carried to a very high perfection before xjwd 
it received the designation by which it is now gene 
rally known the most ancient name for what was 
subsequently denominated logic was dialectic but 
this must be understood with certain limitations by 
plato the term dialectic is frequently employed to 
mark out a particular section of philosophy but this 
section is with plato not coextensive with the domain 
of logic it includes indeed logic but it does not 
exclude metaphysic for it is conversant not only 
about the form but about the matter of our know

soon to learn 

this word siaxemo reirq or inutnjfiyj or rrpayfia ioktuoi

from siaxeyearocu to hold conversation or discourse

versation colloquy controversy dispute but plato u of the 
who defined thought an internal discourse of the soul lectic by 
with itself® and who explained to siaxeyecrtfai by the 
ambiguous expression rip ya did not 

certainly do violence either to the greek language or 
to his own opinions in giving the name of dialectic 
to the process not merely of logical inference but 
of metaphysical speculation in our own times the by hegel 
platonic signification of the word has been revived 
and hegel has applied it in even a more restricted

or the science in general but for a particular and an

wise denominates topics tomtcrj p this i may ob 
serve has been very generally misunderstood and it 
is commonly supposed that aristotle uses the term 
dialectic in two meanings in one meaning for the 
science of logic in general in another for the logic 
of probabilities this is however a mistake there 
is in fact only a single passage in his writings on 
the ground of which it can possibly be maintained 
that he ever employs dialectic in the more exten 
sive meaning this is in his rhetoric i i but the 
passage is not stringent and dialectic may there be 
plausibly interpreted in the more limited signification 
but at any rate it is of no authority for it is an evi

from the margin into the text thus it appears that 
aristotle possessed no single terra by which to desig

epicureans and other ancient schools of philosophy — 

and now proceed to explain to you the second head of 
the definition — viz the genus — class of logic which 
i gave as science 

it was a point long keenly mooted by the old logi lu 
cians whether logic were a science or an art or whether 
neither or both and if a science whether a science an 
practical or a science speculative or at once specula 
tive and practical plato and the platon is ts viewed 
it as a science ° but with them dialectic as i have 
noticed was coextensive with the logic and metaphy 
sics of the peripatetics taken together by aristotle 
himself logic is not defined the greek aristotelians 
and many philosophers since the revival of letters 
deny it to be either science or art the stoics in 
general viewed it as a science and the same was 
done by the arabian and latin schoolmen in more 
modern times however many aristotelians all the 
kamists and a majority of the cartesians maintained 
it to be an art but a considerable party were found 
who defined it as both art and science in germany 
since the time of leibnitz logic has been almost 


universally regarded as a science the controversy the 
which has been waged on this point is perhaps one of on

the most futile in the history of speculation in so 
far as logic is concerned the decision of the question 
is not of the very smallest import it was not in 
consequence of any diversity of opinion in regard to 
the scope and nature of this doctrine that philoso 
phers disputed by what name it should be called 
the controversy was in fact only about what was 
properly an art and what was properly a science 
and as men attached one meaning or another to these 
terms so did they affirm logic to be an art or a sci 
ence or both or neither i should not in fact have 
thought it necessary to say anything on this head 
were it not to guard you against some mistakes of 
the respectable author whose work on logic i have re 
commended to your attention — i mean dr whately 
in the opening sentence of his elements it is said 
— “ logic in the most extensive sense which the name 
can with propriety be made to bear may be consi 
dered as the science and also the art of reason 
ing it investigates the principles on which argumen 
tation is conducted and furnishes rules to secure the 
mind from error in its deductions its most appro 
priate office however is that of instituting an analysis 
of the process of the mind in reasoning and in this 
point of view it is as has been stated strictly a 
science while considered in reference to the practical 
rules above mentioned it may be called the art of 
reasoning this distinction as will hereafter appear 
has been overlooked or not clearly pointed out by most 
writers on the subject logic having been in general 
regarded as merely an art and its claim to hold a place 
among the sciences having been expressly denied” 

all this is from first to last erroneous in the first 
place it is erroneous in what it says of the opinion

prevalent among philosophers in regard to the genus lect 

of logic logic was not as is asserted in general re — 

garded as an art and its claim to hold a place among 
the sciences expressly denied the contrary would 
have been correct for the immense majority of logi 
cians ancient and modem have regarded logic as a 
science and expressly denied it to be an art in the 
second place supposing dr whately’s acceptation of 
the terms art and science to be correct there is not a 
previous logician who would have dreamt of denying 
that on such an acceptation logic was both a science 
and an art but in the third place the discrimination 
itself of art and science is wrong dr whately considers 
science to be any knowledge viewed absolutely and 
not in relation to practice — a signification in which 
every art would in its doctrinal part be a science 
and he defines art to be the application of knowledge 
to practice in which sense ethics politics religion 
and all practical sciences would be arts the dis 
tinction of arts and sciences is thus wrong but in 
the fourth place were the distinction correct it would 
be of no value for it would distinguish nothing 
since art and science would mark out no real differ 
ence between the various branches of knowledge but 
only different points of view under which the same 
branch might be contemplated by us — each being in 
different relations at once a science and an art in 
fact dr whately confuses the distinction of science 
theoretical and science practical with the distinction 
of science and art i am well aware that it would be 
no easy matter to give a general definition of science 
as contradistinguished from art and of art as contra 
distinguished from science but if the words them

selves cannot validly be discriminated it would be 
absurd to attempt to discriminate anything by them 
when i therefore define logic by the genus science 
i do not attempt to give it more than the general de 
nomination of a branch of knowledge for i reserve 
the discrimination of its peculiar character to the 
differential quality afforded by its objectmatter you 
will find when we have discussed the third head of 
the definition that logic is not only a science but a 
demonstrative or apodictic science but so to have 
defined it w r ould have been tautological for a science 
conversant about laws is conversant about necessary 
matter and a science conversant about necessary mat 
ter is demonstrative 

i proceed therefore to the third and last head of the 
definition — to explain to you what is meant by the 
objectmatter of logic — viz the laws of thought as 
thought the consideration of this head naturally 
divides itself into three questions — what is thought 
 what is thought as thought what are the laws 
of thought as thought 

in the first place then in saying that logic is con 
versant about thought we mean to say that it is con 
versant about thought strictly so called the term 
thought is used in two significations of different extent 
in the wider meaning it denotes every cognitive act 
whatever by some philosophers as descartes and his 
disciples it is even used for every mental modification 
of which we are conscious and thus includes the feel 
ings the volitions and the desires in the more lim 
ited meaning it denotes only the acts of the under

standing properly so called that is of the faculty of lect 
comparison or that which i distinguished as the ela — — 
borative or discursive faculty® it is in this more 
restricted signification that thought is said to he the 
objectmatter of logic thus logic does not consider 
the laws which regulate the other powers of mind it 
takes no immediate account of the faculties by which 
we acquire the rude materials of knowledge it sup 
poses these materials in possession and considers only 
the manner of their elaboration it takes no account 
at least in the department of pure logic of memory 
and imagination or of the blind laws of association 
but confines its attention to connections regulated by 
the laws of intelligence finally it does not consider 
the laws themselves of intelligence as given in the re 
gulative faculty — intelligence — common sense for 
in that faculty these laws are data facts ultimate and 
consequently inconceivable but whatever transcends 
the sphere of the conceivable transcends the sphere of 
logic 

such are the functions about which logic is not con 
versant and such in the limited signification of the 
word are the acts which are not denominated thought 

we have hitherto found what thought is not we must 
now endeavour to determine generally what it is 

the contemplation of the world presents to our sub thought 
sidiary faculties a multitude of objects these objects ’ roimr ‘ 
are the rude materials submitted to elaboration by a 
higher and selfactive faculty which operates upon 
them in obedience to certain laws and in conformity 
to certain ends the operation of this faculty is 
thought all thought is a comparison a recognition 
of similarity or difference a conjunction or disjunc

cepts or general notions it compares disjoins or 
conjoins attributes in an act of judgment it com 
pares disjoins or conjoins concepts in reasoning it 
compares disjoins or conjoins judgments in each 
step of this process there is one essential element to 
think to compare to conjoin or disjoin it is necessary 
to recognise one thing through or under another and 
therefore in defining thought proper we may either 
define it as an act of comparison or as a recognition 
of one notion as in or under another it is in per 
forming this act of thinking a thing under a general 
notion that we are said to understand or comprehend 
it for example an object is presented say a book 
this object determines an impression and i am even 
conscious of the impression but without recognising 
to myself what the thing is in that case there is only 
a perception and not properly a thought but sup 
pose i do recognise it for w t hat it is in other words 
compare it with and reduce it under a certain concept 
class or complement of attributes which i call booh 
in that case there is more than a perception — there is 
a thought 

all this will however be fully explained to you in 
the sequel at present i only attempt to give you a 
rude notion of what thinking is to the end that you 
may be able vaguely to comprehend the limitation of 
logic to a certain department of our cognitive func 
tions and what is meant by saying that logic is a 
science of thought 

but thought simply is still too undetermined the 
proper object of logic is something still more definite 
it is not thought in general but thought considered

merely as thought of which this science takes cognis lfct 

ance this expression requires explanation we come 

therefore to the second question — what is meant 
by thought as thought 

to answer this question let us remember what has 
just been said of the act constitutive of thought — viz 
that it is the recognition of a thing as coming under 
a concept in other words the marking an object by 
an attribute or attributes previously known as common 
to sundry objects and to which we have accordingly 
given a general name “ in this process we are able by 
abstraction to distinguish from each other — ° the muter and 
object thought of and ° the kind and manner of th™ k i°i 
thinking it let us employing the old and established 
technical expressions call the first of these the matter 
the second the form of the thought for example when 
i think that the book before me is a folio the matter of 
this thought is book and folio the form of it is a judg 
ment now it is abundantly evident that this analy 
sis of thought into two phases or sides is only the work 
of a scientific discrimination and contrast for as on 
the one hand the matter of which we think is only 
cogitable through a certain form so on the other the 
form under which we think cannot be realised in con 
sciousness unless in actual application to an object”® 

now when i said that logic was conversant about p 

° pcrly con 

thought considered merely as thought i meant simply vernt only 
to say that logic is conversant with the form of former 

d t thought 

thought to the exclusion of the matter this being 
understood i now proceed to show how logic only 
proposes — how logic only can propose the form of 
thought for its object of consideration it is indeed 
true that this limitation of logic to the form of thought

lect lias not always been kept steadily in view by logicians 
— — that it is only gradually that proper views of the 
science have been speculatively adopted and still more 
gradually that they have been carried practically into 
effect insomuch that to the present hour as i shall 
hereafter show you there are sundry doctrines still 
taught as logical which as relative to the matter of 
thought are in fact foreign to the science of its form 
this shown “ but although it is impossible to show by the history 
deration of of the science that logic is conversant with the form 
i to the exclusion of the matter of thought this can 
thing it however be satisfactorily done by a consideration of 
the nature and conditions of the thing itself for if 
it be maintained that logic takes not merely the form 
but the matter of thought into account the matter 
you will recollect is a collective expression for the 
several objects about which thought is conversant in 
that case logic must either consider all those objects 
without distinction or make a selection of some alone 
now the former of these alternatives is manifestly 
impossible for if it were required that logic should 
comprise a full discussion of all cogitable objects in 
other words if logic must draw within its sphere all 
other sciences and thus constitute itself in fact the 
one universal science every one at once perceives the 
absurdity of the requisition and the impossibility of 
its fulfilment but is the second alternative more 
reasonable can it be proposed to logic to take 
cognisance of certain objects of thought to the exclu 
sion of others on this supposition it must be shown 
why logic should consider this particular object and 
not also that but as none but an arbitrary answer 
that is no answer at all can be given to this interro 
gation the absurdity of this alternative is no less

manifest than that of the other the particular ob 
jects or the matter of thought being thus excluded 
the form of human thought alone remains as the ob 
jectmatter of our science in other words logic has 
only to do with thinking as thinking and has no at 
least no immediate concernment with that which is 
thought about logic thus obtains in common par 
lance the appellation of a formal science not indeed 
in the sense as if logic had only a form and not an 
object but simply because the form of human thought 
is the object of logic so that the title foimal science 
is properly only an abbreviated expression” ° 

i proceed now to the third question under thisc 
head — viz what is meant by the laws of thought as u 
thought in other words what is meant by the for 
mal laws of thought 

we have already limited the object of logic to the 
form of thought but there is still required a last and 
final limitation for this form contains more than 
logic can legitimately consider “ human thought 
regarded merely in its formal relation may be con 
sidered in a twofold point of view for on the one 
hand it is either known to us merely from experience 
or observation — we are merely aware of its phenomena 
historically or empirically or on the other by a reflec 
tive speculation — by analysis and abstraction we seek 
out and discriminate in the manifestations of thought 
what is contained of necessary and universal the 
empirical or historical consideration of our thinking 
faculty does not belong to logic but to the phse 
nomenology of mind — to psychology the empirical 
observation of the phenomena necessarily indeed pre

introduction 

logic — i its definition — historical notices of 

opinions regarding its object and domain 

ii its utility 

in my last lecture i commeuced the consideration of lect 

logic — of logic properly so denominated — a science — 

for the cultivation of which eveiy european university j ptultt 
has provided a special chair but which in this country 
in consequence of the misconceptions which have lat 
terly arisen in regard to its nature and its end has 
been very generally superseded insomuch that for a 
considerable period the chairs of logic in our scottisli 
universities have in fact taught almost everything 
except the doctrine which they were established to 
teach after some precursory observations in regard 
to the mode of communication which i should follow 
in my lectures on this subject i entered on the treat 
ment of the science itself and stated to you that a 
systematic view of logic would consist of two parts 
the one being an introduction to the doctrine the 
other a body of the doctrine itself in the introduc 
tion were considered certain preparatory points neces 
sary to be understood before entering on the discus 
sion of the science itself and i stated that these pre 
paratory points were in relation to our science 
exhausted in five questions and their answers — °

ii 


what is logic ° what is its value ° how is it 
distributed ° what is its history ° what are its 
subsidiaries 

i then proceeded to the consideration of the first of 
these questions and as the answer to the question 
— what is logic — is given in its definition i defined 
logic to be the science conversant about the laws of 
thought considered merely as thought warning you 
however that this definition could only be understood 
after an articulate explanation of its contents now 
this definition i showed you naturally fell into three 
parts and each of these parts it behoved to consider 
and illustrate by itself the first was the word sig 
nificant of the thing defined — logic the second was 
the genus by which logic was defined — science the 
third was the objectmatter constituting the differen 
tial quality of logic — the laws of thought as thought 
each of these i considered in its order i first of 
all explained the original meaning of the term logic 
and gave you a brief history of its application i 
then stated what was necessary in regard to the genus 
— science and lastly what is of principal importance 
i endeavoured to make you vaguely aware of that 
wdiich you cannot as yet be supposed competent dis 
tinctly to comprehend i mean the peculiar character 
of the object — objectmatter — about which logic is 
conversant the object of logic as stated in the 
definition is the laws of thought as thought this 
required an articulate explanation and such an ex 
planation i endeavoured to afford you under three 
distinct heads expounding ° what was meant by 
thought ° what was meant by thought as thought 
° what was meant by the laws of thought as thought 

in reference to the first head i stated that logic is 


 


lectures on logic 


 


conversant about thought taken in its stricter signifi 
cation that is about thought considered as the opera 
tion of the understanding proper or of that faculty 
which i distinguished as the elaborative or discur 
sive — the faculty of relations or comparison i at 
tempted to make you vaguely apprehend what is the 
essential characteristic of thought — viz the compre 
hension of a thing under a general notion or attribute 
for such a comprehension enters into every act of the 
discursive faculty in its different gradations of con 
ception judgment and reasoning but by saying 
that logic is conversant about thought proper logic 
is not yet discriminated as a peculiar science for there 
are many sciences likewise inter alia conversant 
about the operations and objects of the elaborative 
faculty there is required a further determination 
of its objectmatter this is done by the limitation 
that logic is conversant not merely about thought 
but about thought as thought the explanation of 
this constituted the second head of our exposition of 
the objectmatter thought i showed could be 
viewed by an analytic abstraction on two sides or 
phases we could either consider the object thought 
or the manner of thinking it in other words we could 
scientifically distinguish from each other the matter and 
the form of thought not that the matter and form have 
any separate existence no object being cogitable except 
under some form of thought and no form of thought 
having any existence in consciousness except some 
object be thought under it this however formed 
no impediment to our analysis of these elements 
through a mental abstraction this is in fact only 
one of a thousand similar abstractions w t e are in the 
making and if such were impossible all

human science would be impossible for example 
extension is only presented to sense under some mo 
dification of colour and even imagination cannot re 
present extension except as coloured we may view 
it in phantasy as black or white as translucent or 
opaque but represent it we cannot except either 
under some positive variety of light or under the nega 
tion of light which is darkness but psychologically 
considered darkness or blackness is as much a colour 
that is a positive sensation as whiteness or redness 
and thus we cannot image to ourselves aught extended 
not even space itself out of relation to colour but 
is this inability even to imagine extension apart from 
some colour any hindrance to our considering it 
scientifically apart from all colour not in the small 
est nor do mathematics and the other sciences find 
any difficulty in treating of extension without even a 
single reference to this condition of its actual mani 
festation the case of logic is precisely the same 
logic considers the form apart from the matter of 
thought and it is able to do this without any trouble 
for though the form is only an actual phenomenon 
when applied to some matter — object — yet as it is not 
necessarily astricted to any object we can always 
consider it abstract from all objects in other words 
from all matter for as the mathematician who can 
not construct his diagrams either to sense or to ima 
gination apart from some particular colour is still 
able to consider the properties of extension apart from 
all colour so the logician though he cannot concretely 
represent the forms of thought except in examples of 
some particular matter is still able to consider the 
properties of these forms apart from all matter the 
possibility being thus apparent of a consideration of

the form abstractly from the matter of thought i lect 

showed you that such an abstraction was necessary 

the objects the matter of thought are infinite no 
one science can embrace them all and therefore to 
suppose logic conversant about the matter of thought 
in general is to say that logic is another name for the 
encyclopaedia — the omnescibile — of human knowledge 

the absurdity of this supposition is apparent but if 
it be impossible for logic to treat of all the objects of 
thought it cannot be supposed that it treats of any 
for no reason can be given why it should limit its 
consideration to some to the exclusion of others as 
logic cannot therefore possibly include all objects 
and as it cannot possibly be shown why it should 
include only some it follows that it must exclude 
from its domain the consideration of the matter of 
thought altogether and as apart from the matter of 
thought there only remains the form it follows that 
logic as a special science of thought must be viewed 
as conversant exclusively about the form of thought 

but the limitation of the objectmatter of logic to c the laws 
the form of thought and the expression form of thought 
thought is convertible with the expression thought as 
thought is not yet enough to discriminate its province 
from that of other sciences for psychology or the 
empirical science of mind is likewise among the 
other mental phenomena conversant about the phe 
nomena of formal thought a still further limitation 
is therefore requisite and this is given in saying 
that logic is the science not merely of thought as 
thought but of the laws of thought as thought it 
is this determination which affords the proximate and 
peculiar difference of logic in contradistinction from 
all other sciences and the explanation of its meaning

lfct constituted the third head of illustration which the 
— — — objectmatter in the definition demanded 

the pluono the phenomena of the formal or subjective phases 
formal of thought are of two kinds they are either such as 
ofuvo kimu are contingent that is such as may or may not appear 
gout nd or they are such as are necessary that is such as can 
™y not but appear these two classes of phenomena are 
however only manifested in conjunction they are 
not discriminated in the actual operations of thought 
and it requires a speculative analysis to separate them 
into their several classes in so far as these pheno 
mena are considered merely as phenomena that is in 
so far as philosophy is merely observant of them as 
manifestations in general they belong to the science 
of empirical or historical psychology but when 
philosophy by a reflective abstraction analyses the 
necessary from the contingent forms of thought there 
results a science which is distinguished from all others 
by taking for its objectmatter the former of these 
classes and this science is logic logic therefore 
is at last fully and finally defined as the science of 
the necessary forms of thought here terminated 
our last lecture but though full and final this 
definition is not explicit and it still remains to evolve 
it into a more precise expression 

now when we say that logic is the science of the 
necessary forms of thought what does the quality of 
necessity here imply 

form of “in the first place it is evident that in so far as a 
four con form of thought is necessary this form must be deter 
it necessity mined or necessitated by the nature of the thinking 
mined by subject itself for if it were determined by anything 
of uio u external to the mind then would it not be a necessary 
but a merely contingent determination the first con 


digitized by googi

dition therefore of the necessity of a form of thought 
is that it is subjectively not objectively determined 

“ in the second place if a form of thought be subjec 
tively necessary it must be original and not acquired 
for if it were acquired there must have been a time 
when it did not exist but if it did ever actually not 
exist we must be able at least to conceive the possi 
bility of its not existing now but if we are so able 
then is the form not necessary for the criterion of a 
contingent cognition is that we can represent to our 
selves the possibility of its nonexistence the second 
condition therefore of the necessity of a form of 
thought is that it is original and not acquired 

“ in the third place if a form of thought be neces 
sary and original it must be universal that is it 
cannot be that it necessitates on some occasions and 
does not necessitate on others for if it did not ne 
cessitate universally then would its necessitation be 
contingent and it would consequently not be an ori 
ginal and necessary principle of mind the third 
condition therefore of the necessity of a form of 
thought is that it is universal 

“ in the fourth place if a form of thought be neces 
sary and universal it must be a law for a law is 
that which applies to all cases without exception and 
from which a deviation is ever and everywhere im 
possible or at least unallowed the fourth and last 
condition therefore of the necessity of a form of 
thought is that it is a law”“ this last condition like 
wise enables us to give the most explicit enunciation 
of the objectmatter of logic in saying that logic is 
the science of the laws of thought as thought or the 
science of the formal laws of thought or the science

qom wi before proceeding further it may be proper to take 
retrospect a very general retrospect of the views that have pre

of logic 

and distinctive development from the genius of aris 
totle to the present time 

merit of tho i may say in general that the view which i have 
view of now presented to you of the object and domain of 

logic is the one which concentrates corrects and 
completes the views which have been generally held 
by logicians of the peculiar province of their science 
it is the one towards which they all gravitate 

aristotlo it is unfortunate that by far the greater number of 
the logical writings of aristotle have perished and 
that those which remain to us exhibit only his views 
of the science considered in its parts or in certain 
special relations none of the treatises which are now 
collected in the organon “ considers the science from 
a central point and we do not even possess a general 
definition of logic by its illustrious founder it would 
therefore be unjust to the mighty master if as has 
usually been done we estimated his conception of the 
science only by the partial views contained in the 
fragmentary or special treatises which have chanced 
to float ashore from the general wreck of his logical 
writings these by themselves are certainly enough 
to place the stagirite high above comparison with 
any subsequent logician but still if he has done so 
much in the halfdozen treatises that still remain what 
may we not conceive him to have accomplished in the 
forty which are recorded and seem to have been lost 
it is therefore not to be attributed to aristotle that sub

sequent logicians mistaking his surviving treatises of a lfct 

logical nature — few in number and written in general — 

not in exposition of the pure science but only of the sci 
ence in certain modified applications — for a systematic 
body of logical doctrine should have allowed his views of 
its partial relations to influence their conceptions of the 
science absolutely and as a whole by this influence 
of the aristotelic treatises we may explain the sin 
gular circumstance that while many indeed most of 
the subsequent logicians speculatively held the sound 
est views in regard to the proper object and end of 
logic few or none of them have attempted by these 
views to purify the science of those extraneous doc 
trines to which the authority of aristotle seemed to 
have given a right of occupancy within its domain i greek a ru

which would lead me into details which the import 
ance of the matter would hardly warrant i shall 
only say in general that in their multifarious contro 
versies under this head the diversity of their opinions 
on subordinate points is not more remarkable than 
their unanimity on principal logic they all discri 
minated as a science of the form and not of the matter 
of thought those of the schoolmen who held the 
object of logic to be things in general held this how

men who held that the objectmatter of logic was 
found in second notions as applied to first only meant 
to say that logic was conversant with conceptions

as regulators of thought — a statement which merely

science in ancient and in modem times with the 
exception apparently of two works of two oxford 
logicians — the institutio of wallis and the compen wm

neither of them rising above a humble mediocrity even 
at the date of its composition and aldrich whom

guide had himself written his book in ignorance of

with numerous and serious errors and that the only

and it does not prevent the most erroneous opinions 

it even suggests them from being taken up in regard 
to its nature other sciences as psychology and 
metaphysic propose for their object among the other 
faculties the operation of reasoning but this con 
sidered in its real nature logic on the contrary 
has the same for its object but only in its formal 
capacity in fact it has in propriety of speech no 
thing to do with the process or operation but is con 
versant only with its laws dr whately s definition 
is therefore not only incompetent but delusive it 
would confound logic and psychology and meta 
physic and tend to perpetuate the misconceptions in 
regard to the nature of logic which have been so 
long prevalent in this country 

but dr whately is not only wrong as measured by whately 
a foreign standard he is wrong as measured by his ami contru 
own he is himself contradictory you have just seen 
that in some places he makes the operation of reason scqllkt

logic well in others he makes this total or ade 
quate object to be language but as there cannot be 
two adequate objects and as language and the opera 
tion of reasoning are not the same there is therefore 
a contradiction “ in introducing” he says “ the 
mention of language previously to the definition of 
logic i have departed from established practice in 
order that it may be clearly understood that logic is 
entirely conversant about language a truth which 
most writers on the subject if indeed they were 
fully aware of it themselves have certainly not taken 
due care to impress on their readers ” and again 
“ logic is wholly concerned in the use of language” 

in our last lecture i called your attention to the 
ambiguity of the term xoyo s in greek meaning ambi 
guously either thought or its expression and this 
ambiguity favoured the rise of two counteropinions 
in regard to the object of logic for while it was 
generally and correctly held to be immediately con 
versant about the internal xoyos thought some how 
ever on the contrary maintained that it was imme 
diately conversant about the external xoyos language 
now by some unaccountable illusion dr whately in 
different places adopts these opposite opinions and 
enunciates them without a word of explanation or 
without even a suspicion that they are contradictory 
of each other 

from what i have now said you may in some 
degree be able to judge how far credit is to be ac 
corded to the assertion that dr whately is the only 
logician who ever clearly displayed the true nature 
and use of logic in fact so far is this assertion from 
the truth that the objectmatter and scope of logic

was far more correctly understood even by the scho 
lastic logicians than by dr whately and i may cau 
tion you by the way that what you may find stated 
in the elements of the views of the schoolmen touch 
ing the nature and end of logic is in general wrong 
in particular i may notice one most erroneous allega 
tion that the schoolmen “ attempted to employ logic 
for the purpose of physical discovery” 

but if compared only with the older logicians 
the assertion of dr hinds is found untenable what 
will it be found if we compare whately with the 
logicians of the kantian and leibnitian schools of 
whose writings neither the archbishop nor his abbre 
viator seems ever to have heard and here i may 
observe that great britain is i believe the only 
country of europe in which books are written by 
respectable authors upon sciences of the progress of 
which for above a century they have never taken 
the trouble to inform themselves 

the second question to which in the introduction to ilthe 
logic an answer is required is — what is the value or logic 
utility of this science before proceeding to a special 
consideration of this question it may be proper to 
observe in general that the real utility of logic has 
been obscured and disparaged by the false utilities 
which have too frequently been arrogated to it for 
when logic was found unable to accomplish what its 
unwise encomiasts had promised the recoil was natural 
and as it failed in performing everything it was lightly 
inferred that it could perform nothing both of these 
extremes are equally erroneous there is that which 
logic can and there is that which logic cannot per 
form and therefore before attempting to show what 
it is that we ought to expect from the study of this

science it will be proper to show wbat it is that 
we ought not i shall therefore in the first place 
consider its false utilities and in the second its 
true 

the attribution of every false utility to logic has 
arisen from erroneous opinions held in regard to the 
object of the science so long as it was supposed that 
logic took any cognisance of the matter of thought — 
so long as it was not distinctly understood that the 
form of thought was the exclusive object of this 
science and so long as it was not disencumbered of 
its extraneous lumber so long must erroneous opin 
ions have been prevalent as to the nature and com 
prehension of its end 

it was accordingly in the first place frequently 
supposed that logic was in a certain sort an instru 
ment of scientific disco very the title of organon — 
instrument — bestowed on the collection we possess 
of the logical treatises of aristotle contributed to this 
error these treatises as i observed are but a few 
of the many writings of the stagirite on logic and 
to him we owe neither the order in which they stand 
arranged nor the general name under which they are 
now comprehended in later times these treatises 
were supposed to contain a complete system of logic 
and logic was viewed as the organ not only of philo 
sophy but of the sciences in general thus it was that 
logic obtained not only the name of instrument or 
instrumental philosophy but many other high sound 
ing titles it was long generally styled the art of 
arts and science of sciences — “ logica” says scotus

determines for another its contents or objects thus 
mathematics may be called the material instru

philology — or study of the languages latin greek 
hebrew chaldee c with a knowledge of their

christian theology and the jurist in like manner 
finds a material instrument in a knowledge of the 
history of the country whose laws he expounds® thus 
also physiology in a material point of view is the

that medicine begins where the philosophy of nature 
leaves off in the latter point of view one science 
is the organon of another when one science determines

the other sciences as it appertains to logic to con 
sider the general doctrine of method and of systematic 
construction in this respect logic may be properly 
allowed to be to the sciences an instrument but only 
a formal instrument 

in regard to the other titles of honour logic can 
not with propriety be denominated a heuretic or 
art of discovery “ for discovery or invention is not 
to be taught by rules but is either the free act of an 
original genius or the consequence of a lucky accident 
which cither conducts the finder to something un

can at best only analytically teach how to discover 
that is by the development and dismemberment of 
what is already discovered by this process there

is nothing new evolved and our knowledge is not lect

is purified and systematised” a it is well observed by 
antonius in cicero — “ nullum est praeceptum in hac

only plastic only formative in relation to our know 
ledge 


again “ logic cannot with propriety be styled the in hnt

apply is to our tormal errors while our material errors 
lie beyond its reach this is evident logic is the 
science of the formal laws of thought but we can 
not in limiting our consideration to the laws of formal 
thinking investigate the contents — the matter of our 
thought logic can therefore only propose to purge 
the understanding of those errors which lie in the 
confusion and perplexities of an inconsequent think 
ing this however it must be confessed is no radi 
cal cure but merely a purification of the understand 
ing in this respect however and to this extent 

logic may justly pretend to be the medicine of the 
mind and may therefore in a formal relation be 
styled as by some logicians it has in fact been ccttli 
articon intellectus 

“ by these observations the value of logic is not 
depreciated they only prepare us to form an esti 
mate of its real amount precisely in fact as too 
much was promised and expected from this study did 
it lose in credit and esteem”

lecture iii 

introduction 

logic — ii its utility — iii its divisions — subjec 
tive and objective — general and special 

the last lecture was occupied with the consideration 
of the latter part of the introductory question — what 
is logic and with that of the first part of the second 
— what is its utility — in the lecture preceding the 
last i had given the definition of logic as the science 
of the laws of thought as thought and taking the 
several parts of this definition had articulately ex 
plained ° what was the meaning and history of the 
w r ord logic ° what was the import of the term 
science the genus of logic and ° what was signi 
fied by laws of thought as thought the objectmatter 
of logic this last i had considered under three heads 
explaining ° what is meant by thought ° what is 
meant by thought as thought and ° what is meant 
by laws of thought as thought it was under the last 
of these heads that the last lecture commenced i 
had in the preceding shown that the form of thought 
comprises two kinds of phenomena given always in 
conjunction but that we are able by abstraction and 
analysis to discriminate them from each other the 
one of these classes comprehends what is contingent 
the other what is necessary in the manifestations of 
thought the necessary element is the peculiar and 


 


lectures on logic 


 


exclusive object of logic whereas the phenomena of 
thought and of mind in general are indiscriminately 
proposed to psychology logic therefore i said is 
distinguished from the other philosophical sciences by 
its definition as the science of the necessary form of 
thought this however though a full and final de 
finition is capable of a still more explicit enunciation 
and i showed how we are entitled to convert the term 
necessary into the term laws and in doing so i took 
the opportunity of explaining how the necessity of a 
mental element being given there is also implicitly 
given the four conditions ° that it is subjective 
° that it is original ° that it is universal and 
° that it is a law the full and explicit definition of 
logic therefore is — the science of the laws of thought 
as thought or the science of the laws of the form 
of thought or the science of the formal laws of 
thought — these being only three various expressions 
of what is really the same 

logic being thus defined i gave a brief and gene 
ral retrospect of the history of opinion in regard to 
the proper object and domain of logic and showed 
how though most logicians had taken speculatively 
and in general a very correct view of the naturo of 
their science they had not carried this view out into 
application by excluding from the sphere of pure or 
abstract logic all not strictly relative to the form 
of thought but had allowed many doctrines relative 
merely to the matter of thought to complicate and to 
deform the science 

i then called attention to the opinions of the author 
whom i recommend to your attention and showed 
that dr whately in his statements relative to the 
objectmatter of logic is vague and obscure errone

ous and selfcontradictory and that so far from being 
entitled to the praise of having been the only logician 
who has clearly displayed the true nature of the 
science on the contrary in the exposition of this 
nature he is far inferior not only in perspicuity and 
precision but in truth to the logicians of almost 
every age and country except our own 

and here taking a view of what we have already 
established i would interpolate some observations 
which i ought in my last lecture to have made 
before leaving the consideration of the first question 
— viz what is logic logic we have seen is ex 
clusively conversant about thought — about thought 
considered strictly as the operation of comparison or 
the faculty of relations and thought in this re 
stricted signification is the cognition of any mental 
object by another in which it is considered as in 
cluded — in other words thought is the knowledge of 
things under conceptions by the way i would here 
pause to make an observation upon the word concep 
tion and to prepare you for the employment of a 
term which i mean hereafter to adopt you are 
aware from what i have already said that i do not 
use conception in the signification in which it is 
applied by mr stewart he usurps it in a very 
limited meaning in a meaning which is peculiar to 
himself — viz for the simple and unmodified repre 
sentation of an object presented in perception® reid 
again vacillates in the signification he attaches to 
this term — using it sometimes as a synonym for 
imagination sometimes as comprehending not only 
imagination but understanding and the object of 
understanding it is in the latter relation alone that 


o see lectures on metaphysics vol ii lect xxxiii p — ed

lectures on logic 

i ever employ it and this is its correct and genuine lect 

signification whether we regard the derivation of the — 

word or its general use by philosophers conception employment 
in english is equivalent to conceptio and conceptus tennt° 
in latin and these terms by the best philosophers 
and the most extensive schools have been employed 
as synonymous for notion notio y the act or object 
of the understanding proper or faculty of relations 

so far therefore you are sufficiently prepared not to 
attribute to the word conception when you hear it 
from me the meaning which it bears in the philoso 
phical writings with which you are most likely to be 
familiar what is the precise meaning of the term 
will be soon fully explained in its proper place when 
we commence the treatment of logic itself but what 
i principally pause at present to say is — that for the 
sake of perspicuity i think it necessary in reference 
to this word to make the following distinction the 
term conception like perception imagination etc 
means two things or rather the same thing in two 
different relations — relations however which it is of 
great importance to distinguish and to mark the dis 
tinction by the employment of distinct words con 
ception means both the act of conceiving and the 
object conceived as perception both the act of per 
ceiving and the thing perceived imagination both 
the act of imagining and what is imagined now 
this is a source of great vagueness in our philoso 
phical discussions have we no means of avoiding this 
inconvenience i think we have and that too with 
 out committing any violence upon language i would 
propose the following distinction for the act of 
conceiving the term conception should be employed 
and that exclusively while for the object of con cep

tion or that which is conceived the term concept 
should be used“ concept is the english of the latin 
conceptum — id quod conceptum est — and had it no 
vested right as an actual denizen of the language it 
has good warrant for its naturalisation there are a 
thousand words in english formed on precisely the 
same analogy as precept digest etc etc but we 
have no occasion to appeal to analogy the term 
concept was in common use among the older philoso 
phical writers in english though like many other 
valuable expressions of these authors it has been over 
looked by our english lexicographers i may add 
that nearly the same fortune has befallen the term in 
french concept was in ordinary use by the old 
french philosophers but had latterly waxed obsolete 
it has however i see been reinstated in its rights 
since the reawakening of philosophy in france and 
in particular it is now employed in that language 
in translating from the german the term begriff i 
shall therefore make no scruple in using the expres 
sion concept for the object of conception and con 
ception i shall exclusively employ to designate the 
act of conceiving whether it might not in like 
manner be proper to introduce the term percept 
for the object of perception i shall not at present 
inquire 

but to return from this digression logic we have 
seen is exclusively conversant about thought strictly

so denominated and thought proper we have seen lect 

is the cognition of one object of thought by another 

in or under which it is mentally included — in other u”n 
words thought is the knowledge of a thing through a mhc 
concept or general notion or of one notion through 
another in thought all that we think about is con 
sidered either as something containing or as something 
contained — in other words every process of thought 
is only a cognition of the necessary relations of our 
concepts this being the case it need not move our 
wonder that logic within its proper sphere is of 
such irrefragable certainty that in the midst of all the 
revolutions of philosophical doctrines it has stood not 
only unshattered but unshaken in this respect logic 
and mathematics stand alone among the sciences 
and their peculiar certainty flows from the same source 

both are conversant about the relations of certain a 
priori forms of intelligence — mathematics about the 
necessary forms of imagination logic about the 
necessary forms of understanding mathematics 
about the relations of our representations of objects 
as out of each other in space and time logic about 
the relations of our concepts of objects as in or under 
each other that is as in different relations respectively 
containing and contained both are thus demonstra 
tive or absolutely certain sciences only as each de 
velops what is given — what is given as necessary in 
the mind itself the laws of logic are grounded on 
the mere possibility of a knowledge through the con 
cepts of the understanding and through these we 
know only by comprehending the many under the 
one concerning the nature of the objects delivered 
by the subsidiary faculties to the elaborative logic

lect the laws according to which their agreement or dis 
agreement is affirmed 

logic i the it is of itself manifest that every science must obey 

cs£hi the laws of logic if it does not — such pretended 
science is not founded on reflection and is only an 
irrational absurdity all inference evolution con 
catenation is conducted on logical principles — prin 
ciples which are ever valid ever imperative ever the 
same but an extension of any science through 
logic is absolutely impossible for by conforming to 
logical canons we acquire no knowledge — receive 
nothing new but are only enabled to render what is 
already obtained more intelligible by analysis and 
arrangement logic is only the negative condition 
of truth £ to attempt by a mere logical knowledge 
to amplify a science is an absurdity as great as if we 
should attempt by a knowledge of the grammatical 
laws of a language to discover what was written in 
this language without a perusal of the several writ 
ings themselves but though logic cannot extend 
cannot amplify a science by the discovery of new 
facts it is not to be supposed that it does not contri 
bute to the progress of science the progress of the 
sciences consists not merely in the accumulation of 
new matter but likewise in the detection of the rela 
tions subsisting among the materials accumulated 
and the reflective abstraction by which this is effected 
must not only follow the laws of logic but is most 
powerfully cultivated by the habits of logical study 
in these intercalary observations i have however in 
sensibly encroached upon the second question — what 
is the utility of logic on this question i now dic 
tate the following paragraph —

if iv as the rules of logic do not regard the lect 

matter but only the form of thought the utility of — 

logic must in like manner be viewed as limited uiuof 
to its influence on our manner of thinking and lusic 
not sought for in any effect it can exert upon 
what we think about it is therefore in the 
first place not to be considered useful as a 
material instrument that is as a mean of extend 
ing our knowledge by the discovery of new 
truths but merely as a formal instrument that 
is as a mean by which knowledge already ac 
quired may be methodised into the form accom 
modated to the conditions of our understanding 

in the second place it is not to be regarded as a 
medicine of the mind to the extent of remedying 
the various errors which originate in the nature 
of the objects of our knowledge but merely to 
the extent of purging the mind of those errors 
which arise from inconsequence and confusion in 
thinking 

logic however is still of eminent utility not only 
as presenting to us the most interesting object of 
contemplation in the mechanism of human thought 
but as teaching how in many relations to discriminate 
truth from error and how to methodise our knowledge 
into system while at the same time in turning the 
mind upon itself it affords to our higher faculties one 
of their most invigorating exercises another utility 
is that logic alone affords us the means requisite to 
accomplish a rational criticism and to communicate 
its results

iii 

 — value of our science from those false utilities which 

in place of enhancing its worth in the opinion of the 
world have in fact mainly contributed to reduce the 
common estimate of its importance far beneath the 
truth i now proceed to terminate what i have to 
say under this head by a few words in exposition of 
what renders the cultivation of logic — of genuine 
logic one of the most important and profitable of our 
studies 

logic gives “ admitting therefore that this science teaches no 
tain extent thing new — that it neither extends the boundaries of 
over our knowledge nor unfolds the mysteries which lie be 
thougbts y nc com p ass f the reflective intellect — and that 

it only investigates the immutable law’s to w r hich the 
mind in thinking is subjected still inasmuch as it 
develops the application of these laws it bestows on 
us to a certain extent a dominion over our thoughts 
themselves and is it nothing to watch the secret 
workshop in w r hich nature fabricates cognitions and 
thoughts and to penetrate into the sanctuary of self 
consciousness to the end that having learnt to know 
ourselves we may be qualified rightly to understand 
all else is it nothing to seize the helm of thought 
and to be able to turn it at our will for through a 
research into the laws of thinking logic gives us in 
a certain sort a possession of the thoughts themselves 
it is true indeed that the mind of man is like the 
universe of matter governed by eternal laws and 
follows even without consciousness the invariable 
canons of its nature but to know and understand 
itself and out of the boundless chaos of phaenomena 
presented to the senses to form concepts through con 
cepts to reduce that chaos to harmony and arrange

ment and thus to establish the dominion of intelli 
gence over the universe of existence — it is this alone 
which constitutes man’s grand and distinctive pre 
eminence” “ “ man” says the great pascal “ is but a 
reed — the very frailest in nature but he is a reed 
that thinks it needs not that the whole universe 
should arm to crush him he dies from an exhalation 
from a drop of water but should the universe con 
spire to crush him man would still be nobler than 
that by which he falls for he knows that he dies 
and of the victory which the universe has over him 
the universe knows nothing thus our whole dignity 

consists in thought let us labour

morality” p 

in the world of sense illusive appearances hover 
around us like evil spirits unreal dreams mingle 
themselves with real knowledge the accustomed 
assumes the character of certainty and the associa 
tions of thought are mistaken for the connections of 
existence we thus require a criterion to discriminate 
truth from error and this criterion is in part at least 
supplied to us by logic logic teaches us to analyse 
the concrete masses of our knowledge into its elements 
and thus gives us a clear and distinct apprehension of 
its parts it teaches us to think consistently and with 
method and it teaches us how to build up our accu 
mulated knowledge into a firm and harmonious edifice

preparatory discipline for philosophy and the sciences 
at large 

there is however one utility which though of a 
subordinate kind i must not omit though i do not 
remember to have seen it insisted on by any logical „ 
writer in reference to this i give you the following 
paragraph — 

 v but logic is further useful as affording a 
nomenclature of the laws by which legitimate 
thinking is governed and of the violation of these 
laws through which thought becomes vicious or 
null 

it is said in hudibras — 

“ that all a rhetoricians rules 
serve only but to name his tools

principal utilities of rhetoric a mere knowledge of

the rules of rhetoric can no more enable us to com lect 

pose well than a mere knowledge of the rules of logic — 

can enable us to think well there is required from 
nature in both the faculty but this faculty must in 
both departments be cultivated by an assiduous and 
also a welldirected exercise that is in the one the 
powers of comparison must be exercised according to 
the rules of a sound rhetoric in the other according 
to the rales of a sound logic in so far therefore 
the utility of either science is something more than a 
mere naming of their tools but the naming of their impmunco 
tools though in itself of little value is valuable as the fic nomcn 
condition of an important function which without claluro 
this could not be performed words do not give 
thoughts but without words thoughts could not be 
fixed limited and expressed they are therefore in 
general the essential condition of all thinking worthy 
of the name now what is true of human thought in 
general is true of logic and rhetoric in particular 

the nomenclature in these sciences is the nomencla 
ture of certain general analyses and distinctions which 
express to the initiated in a single word what the 
uninitiated could supposing — what is not probable — 
that he could perform the relative processes neither 
understand nor express without a tedious and vague 
periphrasis while in his hands it would assume only 
the appearance of a particular observation instead of 
a particular instance of a general and acknowledged 
rule to take a very simple example there is in example 
logic a certain sophism or act of illegal inference by 
which two things are perhaps in a very concealed and 
circuitous manner made to prove each other now 
the man unacquainted with logic may perhaps detect 
and be convinced of the fallacy but how will he

expose it he must enter upon a long statement 
 and explanation and after much labour to himself 
and others he probably does not make his objection 
clear and demonstrative after all but between those 
acquainted with logic the whole matter would be 
settled in two words it would be enough to say and 
show that the inference in question involved a cir cuius 
in concludendo and the refutation is at once under 
stood and admitted it is in like manner that one 
lawyer will express to another the ratio decidendi of 
a case in a single technical expression while their 
clients will only perplex themselves and others in 
their attempts to set forth the merits of their cause 
now if logic did nothing more than establish a certain 
number of decided and decisive rules in reasoning 
and afford us brief and precise expressions by which 
to bring particular cases under these general rules it 
would confer on all who in any way employ their 
intellect that is on the cultivators of every human 
science the most important obligation for it is 
only in the possession of such established rules and 
of such a technical nomenclature that we can accom 
plish with facility and to an adequate extent a criti 
cism of any work of reasoning logical language is 
thus to the general reasoner what the notation of 
arithmetic and still more of algebra is to the mathe 
matician both enable us to comprehend and express 
in a few significant symbols what would otherwise 
overpower us by their complexity and thus it is that 
nothing would contribute more to facilitate and extend 
the faculty of reasoning than a general acquaintance 
with the rules and language of logic — an advantage 
extending indeed to every department of knowledge 
but more especially of importance to those professions

i now proceed to the third of the preliminary ques iii divi

fest that this question may be viewed in two relations 
for in asking how is logic divided we either mean 
how many kinds are there of logic or into how many 
constituent parts is it distributed we may consider 
logic either as a universal or as an integrate whole 

it is necessary to consider the former question first i the 
— for before proceeding to show what are the parts lc ° f 
of which a logic is made up it is requisite previously 
to determine what the logic is of which these parts 
are the components under the former head i there

— the speculative knowledge of these doctrines which 

any individual as socrates plato aristotle may 
possess and the practical dexterity with which he is 
able to apply them 

noth thcso now it is evident that both these logics or rather 
logic considered in this twofold relation ought to be 

™t proposed to himself by an academical instructor we 

ihm nstrik must therefore neglect neither logic considered as 
a system of rules is only valuable as a mean towards 
logic considered as a habit of the mind and there 
fore a logical instructor ought not to think that he ful 
fils his duty — that he accomplishes all that he is called 
on to perform if he limit himself to the mere enounce 
ment of a code of doctrine leaving his pupils to turn 
his instructions to their own account as best they 
may on the contrary he is bound to recollect that 
he should be something more than a book that he 
ought not only himself to deliver the one logic 
but to take care that his pupils acquire the other 
the former indeed he must do as a condition of 
the latter but if he considers the systematic logic 
which he pronounces as of any value except in so 
far as his pupils convert it into an habitual logic he 
understands nothing of the character of the function 
which he attempts to perform it is therefore in 
cumbent on an academical instructor to do what in 
him lies to induce his pupils by logical exercise to 
digest what is presented to them as an objective 
system into a subjective habit logic therefore in 
both these relations belongs to us and neither can be 
neglected without compromising the utility of a course 
like the present

ever add is not real for the mind has truly only 
one mode of thinking one mode of reasoning one 
mode of conducting itself in the investigation of 
truth whatever may be the object on which it exer

empire governing the world by common laws in 
such a dominion there are many provinces various 
regions and different prefectures there is one pre 
fect in asia another in europe a third in africa and 
each is decorated by different titles but each governs

applied to many and different uses — it is employed lect 

for drinking for cooking for brewing for washing ill 

for irrigation for navigation etc in like manner 

logic in itself is one — as a science or an art it is 
single but in its applications it • is of various and 
multiform use in the various branches of knowledge 
conversant be it with necessary or be it with con 
tingent matter — or further to take the example of a 
cognate science if any one were to lay down different 
grammars of a tongue as that may be applied to the 
different purposes of life he would be justly derided 
by all grammarians indeed by all men for who is 
there so ignorant as not to know that there is but 
one grammar of the same language in all its various 
applications ° 

thus likewise there is only one method of reason general

although men are severally occupied in different pur logie is 
suits and although one is therefore entitled a theo ami part of 
logian another a jurist a third a physician and so m which 
on each employs the same processes and is governed appled 
by the same laws of thought logic itself is there 
fore widely different from the use — the application 
of logic for logic is astricted to no determinate 
matter but is extended to all that is the object of 
reason and intelligence the use of logic on the con 
trary although potentially applicable to every matter 
is always actually manifested by special reference to

some one in point of fact logic in its particular ap 
plications no longer remains logic but becomes part 
and parcel of the art or science in which it is applied 
thus logic applied to the objects of geometry is 
nothing else than geometry — logic applied to the ob 
jects of physics nothing else than natural philosophy 
we have indeed certain treatises of logic in refer 
ence to different sciences which may be viewed as 
something more than these sciences themselves for 
example we have treatises on legal logic etc but 
such treatises are only introductions — only methodo 
logies of the art or science to which they relate for 
such special logics only exhibit the mode in which a 
determinate matter or object of science the knowledge 
of which is presupposed must be treated the con 
ditions which regulate the certainty of inferences in 
that matter and the methods by which our knowledge 
of it may be constructed into a scientific whole 
special logic is thus not a single discipline not the 
science of the universal laws of thought but a con 
geries of disciplines as numerous as there are spe

introduction 

logic — iit its divisions — pure and modified 

in my last lecture after terminating the considera lfct 

tion of the second introductory question touching the 

utilities of logic i proceeded to the third introduc 
tory question — what are the divisions of logic 
and stated to you the two most general classifications 
of this science of these the first is the division of 
logic into objective and subjective or systematic 
and habitual the second is its division into general 
and special or abstract and concrete 

to speak only of the latter — abstract or general 
logic is logic viewed as treating of the formal laws 
of thought without respect to any particular matter 
concrete or special logic is logic viewed as treating 
of these laws in relation to a certain matter and in 
subordination to the end of some determinate science 

the former of these is one and belongs alone to philo 
sophy that is to the science of the universal principles 
of knowledge the latter is as manifold as the sciences 
to which it is subservient and of which it in fact 
constitutes a part — viz their methodology this 
division of logic is given but in different terms by 
the greek aristotelians and by the latin schoolmen 


 


 


lectures on logic 


lect the greek division does not remount to aristotle 

— but it is found in his earliest expositor alexander 

of aphrodisias and he was probably not the first by 
whom it was enounced it is into x w p l 

irpayparuv logica rebus avulsa that is logic merely 
formal logic apart from things in other words ab 
stract from all particular matter and siaxeictucr iv 
xpgcra cal yvpvaaruf upayparoiv liogica rebus appli 
cata that is logic as used and exercised upon things 
in other words as applied to certain special objects 

this distinction of logic by the greek aristotelians 
seems altogether unknown to modern logicians the 
division of logic by the scholastic aristotelians is the 
same with the preceding but the terms in which it 
is expressed are less precise and unambiguous this 
division is into the logica docens and logica utens 
the logica docens is explained as logic considered as 
an abstract theory — as a preceptive system of rules 
— “ quae tradit praecepta — the logica utens as logic 
considered as a concrete practice as an application of 
these rules to use — “quae utitur praeceptis” 

the division this scholastic division of logic into docens and 

of logica 

docens and utens has i see been noticed by some of the more 

iogica j 

utcn mi modem authors but it has been altogether mistaken 

token by n 

some mo which it would not have been had these authors 

deni au 

then been aware of the meaning in which the terms were 
employed and had they not been ignorant of the 
more explicit expression of it by the greeks thus 
the terms docens and utens are employed by wolf to 
mark a distinction not the same as that which they 
designate in the scholastic logic and as the wolfian 
distinction will not stand the test of criticism the 
terms themselves have been repudiated by those who

were not aware that there was an older and a more lect 

 jy 

valid division which they alone properly expressed® 

wolf makes the logica docens the mere knowledge 
of the rules the logica utens the habit or dexterity 
of applying them this distinction of general and 
special logic wolf and the wolfian logicians likewise 
denote by that of theoretical and practical logic 

these terms are in themselves by no means a bad 
expression of the distinction but those by whom they 
were employed unfortunately did not limit their 
practical logic to what i have defined as special for 
under practical they included not only special but 
likewise modified logic of which we are now to speak 

having explained then this primary division of 
logic into general and special and stated that gene 
ral logic as alone a branch of philosophy is alone 
the object of our consideration i proceed to give 
the division of general logic into two great species 
or rather parts — viz into pure or abstract and modi 
fied or concrete 

if viii in the third place considered by reference par viil 
to the circumstances under which it can come into i jf i d ‘ vid 
exercise by us logic — logic general or abstract ® nd modi 
is divided into pure and modified — a division 
however which is perhaps rather the distribution 
of a science into its parts than of a genus into 
its species pure logic considers the laws of 
thought proper as contained a priori in the 
nature of pure intelligence itself modified logic

again exhibits these laws as modified in their 
actual applications by certain general circum 
stances external and internal contingent in them 
selves but by which human thought is always 
more or less influenced in its manifestations® 

pure logic considers thought proper simply and 
in itself and apart from the various circumstances by 
which it may be affected in its actual application 
human thought it is evident is not exerted except 
by men and individual men by men thought is not 
exerted out of connection with the other constituents 
of their intellectual and moral character and in each 
individual this character is variously modified by 
various contingent conditions of different original 
genius and of different circumstances contributing to 
develop different faculties and habits now there 
may be conceived a science which considers thought 
not merely as determined by its necessary and universal 
laws but as contingently affected by the empirical 
conditions under which thought is actually exerted — 
which shows what these conditions are how they 
impede and in general modify the act of thinking 
and how in fine their influence may be counteracted

this expression i think improper for the term lfct 

applied logic can only with propriety be used to — 

denote special or concrete logic and is in fact a applied 
brief and excellent translation of the terms by which c 
special logic was designated by the greeks as that £i 

xpycrei ical yvxvacria npayfiaroiv and so in fact by 
the latin logicians was the greek expression ren 
dered let us consider the meaning of the term 
applied logic as applied must be applied to some 
thing and that something can only be an object or 
matter now special logic is necessarily an applied 
logic therefore the term applied if given to what i 
would call modified logic would not distinguish 
modified from special logic but further the term 
applied as given to modified logic considered in 
itself is wrong for in modified logic thought is no 
more considered as actually applied to any particular 
matter than in pure logic modified logic only 
considers the necessary in conjunction with the con 
tingent conditions under which thought is actually 
exertible but it does not consider it as applied to 
one class of objects more than to another that is it 
does not consider it as actually applied to any but as 
potentially applicable to all in every point of view how pro 
therefore the term applied as given to modified 
logic is improper whereas if used at all it ought to 
be used as a synonym for special which i would 
positively have done were it not that having been 
unfortunately bestowed by high authority on what i 
have called modified logic the employment of it to 
designate a totally different distinction might gene 
rate confusion i have therefore refrained from 
making use of the term i find indeed that all logi 
cians who before kant ever employed the expression

lect applied logic employed it as convertible with spe 

— eial or concrete logic® in fine it is to be observed 

that the terms pure and applied as usually employed 
in opposition in the kantian philosophy and in that of 
germany in general are not properly relative and cor 
relative to each other for pure has its proper cor 
relative in modified or mixed applied its proper 
relative in unapplied that is divorced from tilings 
that is abstract 

modified but passing from words to things i may observe 
properly an that it can be questioned whether modified or con 
imrt f a crete logic be entitled to the dignity of an essential 
part of logic in general far less of a coordinate 
species as opposed to pure or abstract logic you 
are aware from what i have prea r iously stated under 
the first introductory question that logic as conver 
sant about a certain class of mental phenomena is 
only a part of the general philosophy of mind but 
that as exclusively conversant about what is necessary 
in the phenomena of thought that is the laws of 
thinking it is contradistinguished from empirical 
psychology or that philosophy of mind which is 
merely observant and inductive of the mental pheno 
mena as facts but if modified or concrete logic be 
considered either as a part or as a species of general 
logic this discrimination of logic as the nomology 
of thought from psychology as the phenomenology of 
mind will not hold for modified logic presupposing 
a knowledge of the general and the contingent phe 
nomena of mind will thus either comprise psychology 
within its sphere or be itself comprised within the

sphere of psychology but whichever alternative may lect 

be preferred the two sciences are no longer distinct — 

it is on this ground that i hold that in reality modi 
fied logic is neither an essential part nor an indepen i 
dent species of general logic but that it is a mere 
mixture of logic and psychology and may therefore 
be called either logical psychology or psychological 
logic® there is thus in truth only one logic that is 

pure or abstract logic but while this i think must 
be admitted in speculative rigour still as all sciences 
are only organised for human ends and as a general 
consideration of the modifying circumstances which 
affect the abstract laws of thought in their actual 
manifestations is of great practical utility i trust 
that i shall not be regarded as deforming the simpli 
city of the science if i follow the example of most 
modern logicians and add be it under protest to 
pure or abstract logic a part or an appendix under 
the name of modified logic in distributing the 
science therefore into these two principal heads you 
will always i request keep steadily in mind that in 
strict propriety pure logic is the only science of 
logic modified logic being only a scientific acci 
dent ambiguously belonging either to logic or to 
psychology 

this being understood i now proceed to state to conpcct us 
you the distribution of the general science into itsclurwof 
parts and as it is of high importance that you now loglc 
obtain a comprehensive view of the relation of these 
parts to each other and to the whole which they con 
stitute in order that you may clearly understand the 
point towards which we travel and every stage in our

lfct progress — i shall comprise this whole statement in the 

— — — following paragraph which i shall endeavour to make 
sufficiently intelligible without much subsequent illus 
tration that illustration however i will give in my 
next lecture as this paragraph is intended to afford 
you a conspectus of the ensuing course in so far as 
it will be occupied with logic i need hardly say that 
you will find it somewhat long it is however i 
believe the only paragraph of any extent which i 
shall hereafter be obliged to dictate 

ix if ix general or abstract logic we have 

distribution 

of logic seen is divided into two parts — into pure and 

into its x 

porta into modified of these in their order 

i — pure logic may i think best be distributed upon 
the following principles we may think and 
we may think well on the one hand the con 
ditions of thinking do not involve the conditions 
of thinking well but the conditions of thinking 
well involve the conditions of thinking logic 
therefore as the science of thought must neces 
sarily consider the conditions of the possibility 
of thought on the other hand the end of 
thought is not merely to think but to think well 
therefore as the end of a science must be con 
formed to the end of its objectmatter logic as 
the science of thought must display not only the 
laws of possible but the laws of perfect thinking 
logic therefore naturally falls into two parts 
the one of which investigates the formal condi 
tions of mere thinking the other the formal con 
ditions of thinking well 


 



lectures on logic g 

i — in regard to the former — the conditions of 
mere thinking are given in certain elementary 
requisites and that part of logic which analy 
ses and considers these may be called its stoiehei 
ology or doctrine of elements these elements 
are either laws or products 

ii — in regard to the latter as perfect thinking 
is an end and as the elementary means being 
supposed the conditions of an end are the ways 
or methods by which it may be accomplished 
that part of logic which analyses and considers 
the methods of perfect thinking may be called 
its methodology or doctrine of method 

thus pure logic is divided into two parts — 
into stoicheiology or the doctrine of elements 
and methodology or the doctrine of method 
of these in their order 

logical stoicheiology or the doctrine conver 
sant about the elementary requisites of mere 
thought i shall divide into two parts the first 
of these treats of the fundamental laws of think 
ing in other words of the universal conditions of 
the thinkable — noetic — nomology the second 
treats of the laws of thinking as governing the 
special functions faculties or products of thought 
in its three gradations of conception — or as it is 
otherwise called simple apprehension — judg 
ment and reasoning — dianoetic — dynamic 

this second part of stoicheiology will there 
fore fall into three subordinate divisions corre 
sponding to these several degrees of conception 
judgment and reasoning — so much for the 
doctrine of elements

logical methodology or the doctrine conver 
sant about the regulated ways or methods in 
which the means of thinking are conducted to 
their end of thinking well is divided into as 
many parts as there are methods and there are 
as many methods as there are different qualities 
in the end to be differently accomplished now 
the perfection of thought consists of three vir 
tues — clear thinking distinct thinking and 
connected thinking each of these virtues is 
accomplished by a distinct method and the 
three methods will consequently afford the divi 
sion of logical methodology into three parts 

the first part comprises the method of clear 
thinking or the doctrine of illustration or defi

the first part treats of the nature of truth 
and error and of the highest laws for their dis

the second treats of the impediments to think 
ing with the means of their removal these 
impediments arise ° from the mind ° from 
the body or ° from external circumstances 
in relation to the mind these impediments 
originate in the senses in selfconsciousness in 
memory in association in imagination in rea 
son in the faculty of language in the feelings 
in the desires in the will in relation to the 
body they originate in temperament or in the 
state of health in relation to external circum 
stances they originate in the diversities of edu 
cation of rank of age of climate of social in 
tercourse etc 

the third part treats of the aids or subsidiaries 
of thinking and thinking is aided either ° 
through the acquisition or ° through the 
communication of knowledge 

the former of these subsidiaries the acquisi 
tion of knowledge consists ° of experience 
and that either by ourselves or by others ° 
of generalisation and this through induction 
and analogy and ° of testimony and this 
either oral or written under this last head 
falls to be considered the credibility of witnesses 
the authenticity and integrity of writings the

the fourth and fifth questions of the introduction 
would now fall to be considered — viz what is the his 
tory and what is the bibliography of logic were 
i writing a book and not giving a course of lectures 
upon logic i would certainly consider these questions 
in the introduction to the science but i would do this 
with the admonition that beginners should pass these 
over and make themselves first of all familiar with 
the doctrines of which the science is itself the comple 
ment for why the history of a science is a narra 
tive of the order in which its several parts have been

developed and of the contributions which have been lkct

made to it by different cultivators but such a narra 
tive necessarily supposes a previous knowledge of the 
contents of the science — a knowledge which is identical 
with a knowledge of the science itself it is therefore 
evident that a history of logic can only be proposed 
with advantage to those who are already in some degree 
familiar with logic itself and as in a course like the 
present i am bound to presume that you are not as 
yet conversant with the science it follows that such a 
history cannot with any propriety be attempted in 
the commencement but only towards the conclusion 
of the lectures 

in regard to the fifth question — what is the biblio v the 
graphy or literature of logic l — the same is true in h y of 
so far as a knowledge of the books written upon a 
science is correlative to a knowledge of its history 

at the same time nothing could be more unprofitable 
than for me to recite to you a long series of works to 
which you have not access by authors of whom you 
probably never heard often in languages which few 
of you understand in the present stage of your 
studies it is not requisite that you should know of 
many books but that you should read attentively a few 

— non multa sed multum — i shall therefore adjourn 
at least the consideration of the question — what in 
general are the principal books on the science of 
logic i — simply recommending to you a few not 
absolutely the best but such as you can most easily 
procure such as are in languages which most of you 
can read and which are of such a character as may 
be studied with most general advantage 

of works in our own language as those most acces 
sible and most intelligible to all there are unfortu £ c ou

lect having terminated our consideration of the various 

y 

— — — questions of which the introduction to logic is com 
logy posed we proceed to the doctrines which make up the 
science itself and commence the first great division 
of pure logic — that which treats of its elementary or 
constituent processes — stoicheiology but stoicheio 
logy was again divided into two parts — into a part 
which considered the fundamental laws of thought 
in general and into a part which considered these laws 
as applied to and regulating the special function of 
thought in its various gradations of conception judg 
ment and reasoning the title therefore of the 
part of logic on which we are about to enter is — 
pure logic part i stoicheiology — section i noetic 
on the fundamental laics of thought 

the iharw before however descending to the consideration of 
thmight in these laws it is necessary to make one or two pre 
genorai m i nar y statements touching the character of that 
thought of which they are the necessary conditions 
and on this point i give in the first place the follow 
ing paragraph — 


 


lectures on logic 


 


it x logic considers thought not as the oper lect 

ation of thinking but as its product it does not — 

treat of conception judgment and reasoning par ‘ x 
but of concepts judgments and reasonings 


i have already endeavoured to give you a general 
knowledge of what is meant by thought you are 
aware that this term is in relation to logic employed 
in its strictest and most limited signification — viz as 
the act or product of the discursive faculty or fa 
culty of relations but it is now proper to consider 
somewhat more closely the determinate nature of this 
process and the special point of view in which it is 
regarded by the logician 

in an act of thinking there are three things which 
we can discriminate in consciousness — ° there is the 
thinking subject that is the mind or ego which 
exerts or manifests the thought ° there is the 
object about which we think which is called the 
matter of thought and ° there is a relation be 
tween subject and object of which we are conscious — 
a relation always manifested in some determinate 
mode or manner — this is the form of thought now 
of these three logic does not consider either the first 
or the second it takes no account at least no direct 
account of the real subject or of the real object of 
thought but is limited exclusively to the form of 
thought this has been already stated but again 
this form of thought is considered by logic only in a 
certain aspect the form of thought may be viewed 
on two sides or in two relations it holds as has been 
said a relation both to its subject and to its object 
and it may accordingly be viewed either in the one of 
these relations or in the other in so far as the form 


thought as 
the object 
of logic 


the subject 
form and 
matter of 
thought 


thought as 
the object

lectures on logic 


lect of thought is considered in reference to the thinking 

 — mind — to the mind by which it is exerted — it is 

considered as an act or operation or energy and in 
this relation it belongs to phenomenal psychology 
whereas in so far as this form is considered in refer 
ence to what thought is about it is considered as the 
product of such an act and in this relation it be 
longs to logic thus phenomenal psychology treats 
of thought proper as conception judgment reasoning 
logic or the nomology of the understanding treats 
of thought proper as a concept as a judgment as a 
reasoning whately i have already shown you 
among other errors in his determination of the object 
matter of logic confounds or reverses this for he 
proposes to logic not thought considered as a product 
but reasoning alone and that too considered as a 
producing operation he thus confounds logic with 
phrenomenal psychology 

be it therefore observed that logic in treating of 
the formal laws of thought treats of these in reference 
to thought considered as a product that is as a con 
cept a judgment a reasoning whereas psychology 
as the phenomenology of mind considers thought as 
the producing act that is as conception judgment 
reasoning you here see by the way the utility of 
distinguishing concept and conception it is unfor 
tunate that we cannot also distinguish more precisely 
judgment and reasoning as producing acts from a 
judgment and a reasoning as products 

par xi xi thought as the knowledge of one thing 

mediate mid in relation to another is a mediate and complex 

complex 

cognition cogultlon 


lectures on logic 


the distinctive peculiarity of thinking in general lect 

is that it involves the cognition of one thing by the — 

cognition of another all thinking is therefore a t b£ lca 
mediate cognition and is thus distinguished from 
our knowledge in perception external and internal 
and in imagination in both of which acts we are 
immediately cognitive of the object external or in 
ternal presented in the one and of the object external 
or internal represented in the other in the presenta 
tive and representative faculties our knowledge is of 
something considered directly and in itself in thought 
on the contrary we know one object only through the 
knowledge of another thus in perception of either 
kind and in imagination the object known is always 
a single determinate object whereas in thought — 
in thought proper — as one object is only known 
through another there must always be a plurality of 
objects in every single thought let us take an 
example of this in regard to the simplest act of 
thought when i see an individual — say bucephalus 
or highflyer— or when i represent him in imagination 

i have a direct and immediate apprehension of a 
certain object in and through itself without reference 
to aught else but when i pronounce the term horse 

i am unable either to perceive in nature or to repre 
sent in imagination any one determinate object cor 
responding to the word i obtain the notion corre 
sponding to this word only as the result of a com 
parison of many perceptions or imaginations of 
bucephalus highflyer dobbin and other indivi 
dual horses it therefore contains many represen 
tations under it has reference to many objects out 
of relation to which it cannot possibly be realised in 
thought and it is in consequence of this necessity of 
representing potentially at least a plurality of in 


 


lectures on logic 


lect dividual objects under the notion horse that it obtains 
— — the denomination concept that is something taken up 
or apprehended in connection with something else 
this however requires a further explication when 
we perform an act of thought of positive thought 
this is done by thinking something and we can think 
anything only by thinking it as existing while 
again we cannot think a thing to exist except in 
certain determinate modes of existence on the other 
hand when we perform an act of negative thought 
this is done by thinking something as not existing in 
this or that determinate mode and when we think it 
as existing in no determinate mode we cease to think 
it at all it becomes a nothing a logical nonentity 
nonens logicum 

it being thus understood that thought can only be 
realised by thinking something it being further 
understood that this something as it is thought must 
be thought as existing and it being still further 
understood that we can think a thing as existing only 
by thinking it as existing in this that and the other 
determinate manner of existence and that whenever 
we cease to think something something existing some 
thing existing in a determinate manner of existence 
we cease to think at all this i say being under 
stood it is here proper to make you once for all 
acquainted with the various terms by which logicians 
designate the modes or manners of com table existence 

o o 

i shall therefore comprise these in the following para 
graph —

lect relative terms in use among logicians requires but 

 — little explanation i may state however that the 

thinking n mi lid only thinks an object by separating it from 
objca others that is by marking it out or characterising it 
and in so far as it does this it encloses it within 
certain fixed limits that is determines it but if 
this discriminative act be expressed in words i pre 
dicate the marks notes characters or determinations 
of the thing and if again these be comprehended 
in one total thought they constitute its concept or 
notion if for example i think of socrates as son 
of sophroniscus as athenian as philosopher as pug 
nosed these are only so many characters limitations 
or determinations which i predicate of socrates which 
distinguish him from all other men and together 
make up my notion or concept of him 

the attri but as thought in all its gradations of conception 
voived in judgment and reasoning is only realised by the 
repitatod attribution of certain qualities or characters to the 
by i pj ec t or about which we think so this attribu 
tion is regulated by laws which render a great part 
what is f this process absolutely necessary but when i 

meant by j 

a law as speak of laws and of their absolute necessity in rela 

applicable x j 

tchisence on thought you must not suppose that these 
laws and that necessity are the same in the world of 
mind as in the world of matter for free intelligences 
a law is an ideal necessity given in the form of a 
precept which we ought to follow but which we may 
also violate if we please whereas for the existences 
which constitute the universe of nature a law is only 
another name for those causes which operate blindly 
and universally in producing certain inevitable results 
by law of thought or by logical necessity we do not 
therefore mean a physical law such as the law of

gravitation but a general precept which we are able lect 

certainly to violate but which if we do not obey our 

whole process of thinking is suicidal or absolutely 
null these laws are consequently the primary con 
ditions of the possibility of valid thought and as the 
whole of pure logic is only an articulate development 
of the various modes in which they are applied their 
consideration in general constitutes the first chapter 
in an orderly system of the science now in ex order of 
plaining to you this subject the method i shall pur sst of the 
sue is the following — i shall first of all state in swiif 
general the number and significance of the laws as thought 
commonly received i shall then more particularly 
consider each of these by itself and in relation to 
the others then detail to you their history and 
finally state to you my own views in regard to their 
deduction number and arrangement 


if xiii the fundamental laws of thought or par xm 
the conditions of the thinkable as commonly tal laws of 
received are four — the law of identity thought 
the law of contradiction the law of exclu 
sion or of excluded middle and the law of 
reason and consequent or of sufficient reason 


of these in their order 


if xiv the principle of identity principium par xiv 
identitatis expresses the relation of total sameness identity 
in which a concept stands to all and the relation of 
partial sameness in which it stands to each of its 
constituent characters in other words it de 
clares the impossibility of thinking the concept 
and its characters as reciprocally unlike it is

the principle of identity is an application of the 
principle of the absolute equivalence of a whole and 
of all its parts taken together to the thinking of a 
thing by the attribution of constituent qualities or 
characters the concept of the thing is a whole the 
characters are the parts of that whole this law r may 
therefore be also thus enounced — everything is equal 
to itself — for in a logical relation the thing and its 
concept coincide as in logic we abstract altogether 
from the reality of the thing which the concept re 
presents it is therefore the same whether we say 
that the concept is equal to all its characters or that 
the thing is equal to itself 

the law has likewise been expressed by the for 
mula — in the predicate the whole is contained ex 
plicitly which in the subject is contained implicitly 
it is also involved in the axiom — nota notes est nota 
rei ipsius 

the logical importance of the law of identity lies 
 in this — that it is the principle of all logical affirma 
tion and definition an example or two may be given 
to illustrate this 

 in a concept which we may call z the characters 
a b and c are thought as its constituents conse 
quently the concept as a unity is equal to the cha 
racters taken together — z a l c if the former

be affirmed so also is the latter therefore z being lfct 

a b c is a is b is c to take a concrete example — 

 — the concept man is a complement made up of the 
characters ° substance ° material ° organised 

° animated ° rationed ° of this earth in other 
words man is substance is material is organised is 
animated is rational being as entering into every 
attribution may be discharged as affording no distinc 
tion 

 again suppose that in the example given the 
character a is made up of the characters l m n it 
follows by the same law of identity that za 

l n is l is m is the concept man contains 
in it the character animal and the character animal 
contains in it the characters corporeal organised 
living c 

the second law is the principle of contradiction or 
noncontradiction in relation to which i shall dictate 
the following paragraph — 

it xv when an object is determined by the pr xv 
affirmation of a certain character this object indicium 
cannot be thought to be the same when such 
character is denied of it the impossibility of 
this is enounced in what is called the principle 
of contradiction principium contradictionis 
seu repugnantice assertions concerning a thing 
are mutually contradictory when the one asserts 
that the thing possesses the character which 
the other asserts that it does not this law is 
logically expressed in the formula — what is 
contradictory is unthinkable a— not a— or 
a — a— 

vol i f

lect now in the first place in regard to the name of 

 this law it may be observed that as it enjoins the 

name ier absence of contradiction as the indispensable condi 
tion of thought it ought to be called not the law of 
contradiction but the law of noncontradiction or 
of nonrepugnantia a 

how this law has frequently been enounced in the for 

enounced mu j a — jj s i m p ss ikl e that the same thing can at 

once be and not be but this is exposed to sundry 
objections it is vague and therefore useless it 
does not indicate whether a real or a notional existence 
is meant and if it mean the former then is it not 
a logical but a metaphysical axiom but even as a 
metaphysical axiom it is imperfect for to the expres 
sion at once simul must be added — in the same place 
in the same respect kef 

this law has likewise been expressed by the for 
mula — contradictory attributes cannot be united in 
one act of consciousness but this is also obnoxious 
to objection for a judgment expresses as good a 
unity of consciousness as a concept but when i 
judge that round and square are contradictory attri 
butes there are found in this judgment contradictory 
attributes but yet a unity of consciousness the 
formula is therefore vaguely and inaccurately ex 
pressed 

tho prm the logical import of this law lies in its being the 
logical nega principle of all logical negation and distinction 
distinction the law of identity and the law of contradiction 
are coordinate and reciprocally relative and neither 
can be educed as second from the other as first for 
in every such attempt at derivation the supposed

secondary law is in fact always necessarily presup 
posed® these are in fact one and the same law — 
differing only by a positive and negative expression 

in relation to the third law take the following 
paragraph — 


lect 

v 


 xvi the principle of excluded third orparxvi 
middle — viz between two contradictories princi excluded 
pium exclusi meclii vel tertii enounces that con e 
dition of thought which compels us of tw t o repug 
nant notions which cannot both coexist to think 
either the one or the other as existing hence 
arises the general axiom — of contradictory at 
tributions we can only affirm one of a thing 
and if one be explicitly affirmed the other is 
implicitly denied a either is or is not a 
either is or is not bp 


by the laws of identity and contradiction i am logical 
warranted to conclude from the truth of one contra offhfstw 
dictory proposition to the falsehood of the other and 
by the law of excluded middle i am warranted to 
conclude from the falsehood of one contradictory pro 
position to the truth of the other and in this lies 
the peculiar force and import of this last principle 

for the logical significance of the law of excluded 
middle consists in this that it limits or shuts in the 
sphere of the thinkable in relation to affirmation for 
it determines that of the two forms given in the laws 
of identity and contradiction and by these laws 
affirmed as those exclusively possible the one or the 
other must be affirmed as necessary 

a this is shown more in detail by § — ed

lect the law of excluded middle is the principle or 

disjunctive judgments that is of judgments in which 

™t d n “ a plurality of judgments are contained and which 
j juincnt stand in such a reciprocal relation that the affirmation 
of one is the denial of the other 

i now go on to the fourth law 


par xvii 
law of 
sufficient 
reason or 
of reason 
and conse 
quent 


if xvii the thinking of an object as actually 
characterised by positive or by negative attributes 
is not left to the caprice of understanding — the 
faculty of thought but that faculty must be 
necessitated to this or that determinate act of 
thinking by a knowledge of something different 
from and independent of the process of thinking 
itself this condition of our understanding is 
expressed by the law as it is called of sufficient 
reason principium ration is svfficientis but it 
is more properly denominated the law of reason 
and consequent principium rationis el conse 
cutionis that knowledge by which the mind 
is necessitated to affirm or posit something else 
is called the logical reason ground or antecedent 
that something else which the mind is necessi 
tated to affirm or posit is called the logical con 
sequent and the relation between the reason and 
consequent is called the logical connection or 
consequence this law is expressed in the for 
mula — infer nothing without a ground or reason a 


relations 
between 
reason and 
consequent 


the relations between reason and consequent when 
comprehended in a pure thought are the following — • 
 when a reason is explicitly or implicitly given 
then there must exist a consequent and vice versa 


u see schulze logilt § and krug logik § — ed 


 


lectures on logic 


 


when a consequent is given there must also exist a lect 
reason 


 where there is no reason there can be no conse 
quent and vice versa where there is no consequent 

either implicitly or explicitly there can be no reason 

that is the concepts of reason and of consequent as 
reciprocally relative involve and suppose each other 

the logical significance of the law of reason and logical c 
consequent lies in this — that in virtue of it thought thi law ° 
is constituted into a series of acts all indissolubly con 
nected each necessarily inferring the other thus it 
is that the distinction and opposition of possible actual 
and necessary matter which has been introduced into 
logic is a doctrine wholly extraneous to this science 

i may observe that “ reason is something different rcafton and 
from cause and consequent something different from and causa 
effect though cause and effect in so far as they are “ d effcct 
conceived in thought stand to each other in the rela 
tion of reason and consequent cause is thus thought 
of as a real object which affords the reason of the exist 
ence of another real object the effect and effect is 
thought of as a real object which is the consequent of 
another real object the cause accordingly every 
cause is recognised in thought as a reason and eveiy 
effect is recognised in thought as a consequent but 
the converse is not true that every reason is really 
considered a cause and every consequent really con 
sidered an effect we must therefore carefully dis 
tinguish mere reason and mere consequent that is 
ideal or logical reason and consequent from the rea 
son which is a cause and the consequent which is an

to the mere synthesis of thoughts whereas the ex 
pression metaphysical reason and consequent denotes 
the real connection of existences hence the axiom 
of causality as a metaphysical principle is essentially 
different from the axiom of reason and consequent as 
a logical principle both however are frequently 
confounded with each other and the law of reason 
and consequent indeed formerly found its place in 
the systems of metaphysic while it was not at least 
explicitly considered in those of logic the two 
terms condition and conditioned happily express at 
once the relations both of reason and consequent and 
of cause and effect a condition is a thing which de 
termines negatively at least the existence of another 
the conditioned is a thing whose existence is deter 
mined in and by another if used in an ideal or logi 
cal signification condition and conditioned import 
only the reason in conjunction with its consequent 
if used in a real or metaphysical sense they express 
the cause in connection with its effect” a 

i have now in the prosecution of our inquiry into 
the fundamental laws of logical thinking to say a 
few words in regard to their history — their history 
being the narration of the order in which and of the 
philosophers by whom they were articulately de 
veloped

position of the law of reason and 
consequent does not represent the 
authors latest view in a note 
to the ducussions p where a 
similar doctrine had been maintained 
in the article as originally published 
he says m the logical relation of 
reason and consequent as more than 
a mere corollary of the law of non 
contradiction in its three phases is i 
am confident of proving erroneous 


and again in the same work p 
“ the principle of sufficient reason 
should be excluded from logic for 
in as much as this principle is not ma 
terial it is only a derivation of the 
three formal laws and in as much as 
it is material it coincides with the 
principle of causality and is extra 
logical” the laws of thought pro 
perly ho called are thus reduced to 
three — those of identity contradic 
tion and excluded middle — ed

of the first three laws which from their intimate lect

cognation may not unreasonably be regarded as only — 

the three sides or phases of a single law the law of ijm” “ f 
identity which stands first in the order of nature 
was indeed that last developed in the order of time “ f 
the axioms of contradiction and of excluded middle 
having been long enounced ere that of identity had 
been discriminated and raised to the rank of a coordi 
nate principle i shall not therefore now follow the 
order in which i detailed to you these laws but the 
order in which they were chronologically generalised 

the principles of contradiction and of excluded the p rin 
middle can both be traced back to plato by whom comnic 
they were enounced and frequently applied though excluded 
it was not till long after that either of them obtained 
a distinctive appellation to take the principle ofputo 
contradiction first this law plato frequently em 
ploys but the most remarkable passages are found in 
the phcsdo in the sophista and in the fourth and 
seventh books of the republic “ 

this law was however more distinctively and em l of 
phatically enounced by aristotle in one place he tion cm p b 
says “ it is manifest that no one can conceive to enounced by 

 ariitotle 

himself that the same thing can at once be and not 
be for thus he would hold repugnant opinions and 
subvert the reality of truth wherefore all who 
attempt to demonstrate reduce everything to this as 
the ultimate doctrine for this is by nature the prin 
ciple of all other axioms” and in several passages 
of his metaphysics y in his prior analytics and in 
his posterior analytics he observes that “ some had

attempted to demonstrate this principle — an attempt

we ought to require a demonstration and of those 
things whereof we ought not for it is impossible to 
demonstrate everything as in this case we must re 
gress and regress to infinity and all demonstration 
would on that supposition be impossible” 

following aristotle the peripatetics established this 
law as the highest principle of knowledge from the

has subsequently been denominated the principle or 
law or axiom of contradiction dioiixa rrjs dvridaeo

ammonius and philoponus where it is said to be 
“ the criterion which divides truth from falsehood 
throughout the universe of existence” “ the school

even says that the law of contradiction holds the 
same supremacy among the principles of knowledge 
which the deity does among the principles of exist 
ence 

after the decline of the aristotelian philosophy 
many controversies arose touching the truth and still 
more touching the primitive or axiomatic character of 
this law some maintained that it was indemon

and universality of its truth except among those

through positions repugnant and therefore on logical 
principles mutually exclusive they have found it ne

this law though universally recognised as a principle 
in the greek peripatetic school and in the schools of 
the middle ages only received the distinctive appella

this done is antonius andreas a scholar of scotus who “ 
flourished at the end of the thirteenth and beginning 
of the fourteenth century this schoolman in the fourth

subsequently to this author the question concerning 
the relative priority of the two laws of identity and 
of contradiction became one much agitated in the 
schools though there were also found some who 
asserted to the law of excluded middle this supreme 
rank a leibnitz as i have said did not always dis 
tinguish the principles of identity and of contradic 
tion by wolf the former was styled the principle 
of certainty principium certitudinis but he no 
more than leibnitz himself sufficiently discriminated 
between it and the law of contradiction this was 
however done by baumgarten another distinguished 
follower of leibnitz and from him it received the 
name of the principle of position that is of affirma

tatis — the name by which it is now universally known 
this principle has found greater favour in the eyes of 
the absolutist philosophers than those of contradiction 
and excluded middle by fichte and schelling it 
has been placed as the primary principle of all philo 
sophy hegel alone subjects it along with the 
other laws of thought to a rigid but fallacious criti

the fourth law that of reason and consequent lfct 

which stands apart by itself from the other three was 

like the laws of contradiction and excluded middle 
recognised by plato a he lays it down as a postu vn c lueot

the same is frequently done by his scholar aristotle kh

ambiguous term cause atria afriov aristotle indeed

nihil sine causa — a formula adopted by the school th sew 
men although they after aristotle distinguished 
under it the ratio essendi and the ratio cognoscendi 

in modern times the attention of philosophers was loihniu 
called to this law by leibnitz who on the two prin tion to law

law as i have mentioned he comprehended however 
the principle of identity and in the former he did 
not sufficiently discriminate in terms the law of cau

this axiom he gave various denominations — now call

on this as on other points eminently worthy of your 
study the documents in which this controversy is 
contained were published in the english edition under 
the title a collection of papers which passed between 
the late learned mr leibnitz and dr clarice in the 
years and relating to the principles of 
natural philosophy and religion london “ 

wolf the most distinguished follower of leibnitz 
employs the formula — “ nothing is without a suffi

that is if anything is supposed to be ponitur esse 
something also must be supposed whence it may be 
understood why the same is rather than is not” he

cause cavsa but his censure equally applies to his 
master leibnitz as to them and aristotle for all of 
these philosophers though they did not confound the 
two principles employed ambiguous terms to denote 
them 

the leibnitzian doctrine of the universality of the 
law of sufficient reason both as a principle of exist 
ence and of thought excited much discussion among 
the philosophers more particularly of germany in

the validity of the principle others attempted to re

the advocates of the former opinion if the principle 
be admitted that everything must have a sufficient 
reason why it is rather than why it is not — on this 
hypothesis error itself will have such a reason and 
therefore must cease forthwith to be error 

many philosophers as wolf and baumgarten 
endeavoured to demonstrate this principle by the 
principle of contradiction while others with better 
success showed that all such demonstrations were 
illogical

rcca i t u a g rg j p ar f q f p ure logic is the doctrine of ele

or possible thinking these elements are of two kinds

regulating its necessary products or they are the pro 
ducts themselves as regulated by those laws the 
fundamental laws are four in number — the law of 
identity the law of contradiction the law of ex 
cluded middle the law of reason and consequent 
the products of thought are three — ° concepts or 
notions ° judgments and ° reasonings in our 
last lecture we considered the first of these two 
parts of the doctrine of elements and i went through 
the general explanation of the contents and import of 
the four laws and their history without recapitu 
lating what was then stated i shall now proceed to 
certain general observations which may be suggested 
in relation to the four laws

sists of the three principles of identity contradiction lfct 

and excluded middle the second comprehends the — 

principle of reason and consequent alone this clas unf 
sification is founded both on the different reciprocal 
connection of the laws and on the different nature of 
their results 

in the first place in regard to the difference of con this cu 
nection between the laws themselves it is at once founded 
evident that the first three stand in a far more proxi reu of 
mate relation to each other than to the fourth the first between the 
three are indeed so intimately connected that though mku em ’ 
it has not even been attempted to carry them up into 
a higher principle and though the various and con 
tradictory endeavours that have been made to elevate 
one or other into an antecedent and to degrade others 
into consequents have only shown by their failure the 
impossibility of reducing the three to one still so 
intimate is their connection that each in fact sup 
poses the others they are like the three sides of a 
triangle not the same not reducible to unity each 
pretending with equal right to a prior consideration 
and each if considered first giving in its own exist 
ence the existence of the other two this intimacy 
of relation does not subsist between the principle of 
reason and consequent and the three other laws 
they do not in the same necessary manner suggest 
each other in thought the explanation of this is 
found in the different nature of their results and 
this is the second subject of our consideration® 

in the second place then the distinction of the four on the 
laws into two classes is not only warranted by the r tl • 
difference of their mutual dependence in thought but two classes

lect likewise by the difference of the end which the two 

— classes severally accomplish for the first three laws 

n °t only stand apart by themselves forming as it were 
a single principle viewed in three different aspects 
but they necessitate a result veiy different both in 
kind and in degree from that determined by the law 
of reason and consequent the difference in their 
result consists in this — whatever violates the laws 
whether of identity of contradiction or of excluded 
middle we feel to be absolutely impossible not only 
in thought but in existence thus we cannot attri 
bute even to omnipotence the power of making a 
thing different from itself of making a thing at once 
to be and not to be of making a thing neither to be 
nor not to be these three laws thus determine to 
us the sphere of possibility and of impossibility and 
this not merely in thought but in reality not only 
logically but metaphysically very different is the 
result of the law of reason and consequent this 
principle merely excludes from the sphere of positive 
thought what we cannot comprehend for whatever 
we comprehend that through which we comprehend 
it is its reason what therefore violates the law of 
reason and consequent merely in virtue of this law 
becomes a logical zero that is we are compelled to 
think it as unthinkable but not to think it though 
actually nonexistent subjectively or in thought as 
therefore necessarily nonexistent objectively or in 
reality and why it may be asked does the law of 
reason and consequent not equally determine the 
sphere of general possibility as the laws of identity 
contradiction and excluded middle i why are we 
to view the unthinkable in the one case not to be 
equally impossible in reality as the unthinkable in the

other some philosophers have on the one hand lect 
asserted to the deity the power of reconciling contra l 


dictions a while on the other a greater number have 


opinions 

made the conceivable in human thought the gauge of 
the possible in existence what warrants us it may 
be asked to condemn these opposite procedures as 
equally unphilosophical in answer to this though 
the matter belongs more properly to metaphysic than 
to logic i may say a few words which however i 
am aware cannot by many of you be as yet ade 
quately understood 

to deny the universal application of the first three ti rcspcc 
laws is in fact to subvert the reality of thought j of the two 
and as this subversion is itself an act of thought it in the laws of 
fact annihilates itself fineftd 

when for example i say that a is and then say to deny the 
that a is not by the second assertion i sublate or take astion 
away what by the first assertion i posited or laid utoiw£ 
down thought in the one case undoing by negation ureiity 
what in the other it had by affirmation done but ol thouklt 
when it is asserted that a existing and a nonexisting 
are at once true what does this imply it implies 
that negation and affirmation correspond to nothing 
out of the mind — that there is no agreement no dis 
agreement between thought and its objects and this 
is tantamount to saying that truth and falsehood are 
merely empty sounds for if we only think by affir 
mation and negation and if these are only as they 
are exclusive of each other it follows that unless 
existence and nonexistence be opposed objectively in 
the same manner as affirmation and negation are 
opposed subjectively all our thought is a mere illu 
sion thus it is that those who would assert the 

a compare le clerc logica p ii c — ed 


 


 


lectures ox logic 


lect possibility of contradictions being at once true in fact 
 — — annihilate the possibility of truth itself and the whole 
significance of thought 

but this is but this is not the case when we deny the universal 
inthede the absolute application of the law of reason and 
universal consequent when i say that a thing may be of 
of the law of which i cannot conceive the possibility that is by 

reason and • r 

consequent conceiving it as the consequent ot a certain reason 
i only say that thought is limited but within its 
limits i do not deny i do not subvert its truth but 
how it may be asked is it shown that thought is thus 
limited how is it shown that the inconceivable is 
not an index of the impossible and that those philo 
sophers who have employed it as the criterion of the 
absurd are themselves guilty of absurdity this is a 
matter which will come under our consideration at 
this law another time and in its proper place at present it 
general not will be sufficient to state in general that the hypothe 
measure of sis which makes the thinkable the measure of the pos 
polsiity sible brings the principle of reason and consequent at 
once into collision with the three higher laws and this 
hypothesis itself is thus reduced at once to contradic 
tion and absurdity for if we take a comprehensive 
view of the phenomena of thought we shall find that 
all that we can positively think that is all that is 
within the jurisdiction of the law of reason and con 
sequent lies between two opposite poles of thought 
which as exclusive of each other cannot on the prin 
ciples of identity and contradiction both be true but 
of which on the principle of excluded middle the one 
or the other must let us take for example any of 
the general objects of our knowledge let us take 
body or rather since body as extended is included 
under extension let us take extension itself or space

now extension alone will exhibit to us two pairs of lect 

 yj 

contradictory inconceivables that is in all four incom — 

prehensibles but of which though all are equally un 
thinkable and on the hypothesis in question all 
therefore equally impossible we are compelled by 
the law of excluded middle to admit some two as 
true and necessary

 cuce to ex 

or as a part and in each aspect it affords us two tension i

have an end a circumference or unlimited that is 
have no end no circumference these are contradic 
tory suppositions both therefore cannot but one 
must be true now let us try positively to compre 
hend positively to conceive the possibility of either of 
these two mutually exclusive alternatives can we 
represent or realise in thought extension as absolutely 
limited in other words can we mentally hedge round 
the whole of space conceive it absolutely bounded that 
is so that beyond its boundary there is no outlying space or 
no surrounding space i this is impossible what absolutely 

n t • bounded uu 

ever compass ot space we may enclose by any liraita thinkable 
tion of thought we shall find that we have no dif 
ficulty in transcending these limits nay we shall 
find that we cannot but transcend them for we are 
unable to think any extent of space except as within 
a still ulterior space of which let us think till the 
powers of thinking fail we can never reach the cir 
cumference it is thus impossible for us to think 
space as a totality that is as absolutely bounded but 
allcontaining we may therefore lay down this first 
extreme as inconceivable we cannot think space as 
limited

let us now consider its contradictory can we 
comprehend the possibility of infinite or unlimited 
space to suppose this is a direct contradiction in 
¦terms it is to comprehend the incomprehensible we 
think we conceive we comprehend a thing only as 
we think it as within or under something else but to 
do this of the infinite is to think the infinite as finite 
which is contradictory and absurd 

now here it may be asked how have we then the 
word infinite how have we the notion which this 
word expresses the answer to this question is con 
tained in the distinction of positive and negative 
thought we have a positive concept of a thing when 
we think it by the qualities of which it is the comple 
ment but as the attribution of qualities is an affir 
mation as affirmation and negation are relatives and 
as relatives are known only in and through each other 
we cannot therefore have a consciousness of the affir 
mation of any quality without having at the same 
time the correlative consciousness of its negation 
now the one consciousness is a positive the other 
consciousness is a negative notion but in point of 
fact a negative notion is only the negation of a 
notion we think only by the attribution of certain 
qualities and the negation of these qualities and of 
this attribution is simply in so far a denial of our 
thinking at all as affirmation always suggests nega 
tion eveiy positive notion must likewise suggest a 
negative notion and as language is the reflex of 
thought the positive and negative notions are ex 
pressed by positive and negative uames thus it is 
with the infinite the finite is the only object of real 
or positive thought it is that alone which we think 
by the attribution of determinate characters the

infinite on the contrary is conceived only by the lect 
thinking away of every character by which the finite vl 
was conceived in other words we conceive it only as 
inconceivable this relation of the infinite to the 
finite is shown indeed in the terms by which it is 
expressed in every language thus in latin infinitum 
in greek antipov in german unendlich in all of 
which original tongues the word expressive of the 
infinite is only a negative expression of the finite or 
limited thus the very objection from the existence 
of a name and notion of the infinite when analysed 
only proves more clearly that the infinite is no object 
of thought that we conceive it not in itself but only 
in correlation and contrast to the finite 

the indefinite is however sometimes confounded the indc 


with the infinite though there are hardly two notions 
which without being contradictory differ more widely 
the indefinite has a subjective the infinite an objec 
tive relation the one i merely the negation of the 
actual apprehension of limits the other the negation 
of the possible existence of limits 

but to return whence we have been carried it is 
manifest that we can no more realise the thought or 
conception of infinite unbounded or unlimited space 
than we can realise the conception of a finite or ab 
solutely bounded space but these two inconceivables 
are reciprocal contradictories and if we are unable to 
comprehend the possibility of either while however 
on the principle of excluded middle one or other must 
be admitted the hypothesis is manifestly false that 
proposes the subjective or formal law of reason and 
consequent as the criterion of real or objective possi 
bility 

it is needless to show that the same result is given 


finite and 
infinite— 
how distin

space as 
bounded and 
space as un 
bounded 
being two 
inconceiv 
able contra 
dictories

by the experiment made on extension considered as 
a part as divisible here if we attempt to divide 
extension in thought we shall neither on the one 
hand succeed in conceiving the possibility of an 
absolute minimum of space that is a minimum ex 
hypothesi extended but which cannot be conceived as 
divisible into parts nor on the other of carrying on 
this division to infinity but as these are contradic 
tory opposites they again afford a similar refutation 
of the hypothesis in question 

but the same conclusion is reached by simply con 
sidering the law of beason and consequent in itself 
this law enjoins — think nothing without a reason 
why we must think it that is think nothing except 
as contained in as evolved out of something else 
which we already know now this reason — this 
something else — in obedience to this very law must 
as itself known be itself a consequent of some other 
antecedent and this antecedent be again the conse 
quent of some anterior or higher reason and so on 
ad infinitum but the human mind is not possessed 
of infinite powers or of an infinite series of reasons 
and consequents on the contrary its faculties are 
very limited and its stock of knowledge is very small 
to erect this law therefore into a standard of exist 
ence is in fact to bring down the infinitude of the 
universe to the finitude of man — a proceeding than 
which nothing can be imagined more absurd the 
fact is that the law of reason and consequent can 
with the law of cause and effect the law of sub 
stance and phenomenon c be if i am not mis 
taken all reduced to one higher principle a principle 
which explains from the very limitation of the human 
mind from the very imbecility of its powers a great

variety of phenomena which from the liberality of lect 

philosophers have obtained for their solution a num — 

her of positive and special principles this however 
is a discussion which would here be out of place® 

what however has been said may suffice to show summary 
that while the first three laws of thought are of an the spheres 
absolute and universal cogency the fourth is only of of thought 
a cogency relative and particular that while the 
former determine the possibility not only of all 
thought but of all real knowledge the latter only 
regulates the validity of mediate or reflective thought 

the laws of identity contradiction and excluded 
middle are therefore not only logical but metaphysi 
cal principles the law of reason and consequent a 
logical principle alone a doctrine which is however 
the converse of what is generally taught

influence which these laws exert upon the operations which the

 ou the 

multiform they may seem are so governed in all their operations

manifestations by the preceding laws that no thought 
can pretend to validity and truth which is not in 
consonance with which is not governed by them 

for man can recognise that alone as real and assured 
which the laws of his understanding sanction and 
he cannot but regard that as false and unreal which 
these laws condemn from this however it by no 
means follows that what is thought in conformity 
to these laws is therefore true for the sphere of 
thought is far wider than the sphere of reality and 
no inference is valid from the correctest thinking of 
an object to its actual existence while these laws 
therefore are the highest criterion of the nonreality

have already explained considering the form alone of 
thought to the exclusion of its matter can draw no 
conclusion from the correctness of the manner of 
thinking an object to the reality of the object itself 
yet among modern nay recent philosophers two 
opposite doctrines have sprung up which on opposite 
sides have overlooked the true relations of logic 
“one party of philosophers defining truth in general — 
the absolute harmony of our thoughts and cognitions 
— divide truth into a formal or logical and into a 
material or metaphysical according as that harmony 
is in consonance with the laws of formal thought or 
over and above with the laws of real knowledge® 
the criterion of formal truth they place in the prin

enouncing that what is noncontradictory and conse 
quent is formally true this criterion which is posi

is noncontradictory and consequent can always be

tradictory and logically inconsequent is in reality 
impossible at the same time what is not selfcon 
tradictory and not logically inconsequent is not how 
ever to be regarded as having an actual existence 
but here the foundation is treacherous the notion of

over and above we require to be assured that what i™ ’ 
we think is real and is as we think it to be are we 
satisfied on this point we then regard our thoughts 
as true whereas if we are not satisfied of this we 
deem them false how well soever they may quadrate

any absolute harmony of mere thought that truth con 
sists but solely in the correspondence of our thoughts 
with their objects the distinction of formal and 
material truth is thus not only unsound in itself but 
opposed to the notion of truth universally held and 
embodied in all languages but if this distinction be 
inept the title of logic as a positive standard of 
truth must be denied it can only be a negative

mistake of 
reid in 
regard to 
conception 


being for these terms they use convertibly in an 
identity of knowledge and existence of himself and 
the divinity this doctrine which i shall not now 
attempt to make you understand is developed in very 
various schemes that is the different philosophers 
attempt by very different and contradictory methods 
to arrive at the same end all these systems how 
ever agree in this — they are all at variance with the 
four logical laws some indeed are established on 
the express denial of the validity of these laws and 
others without daring overtly to reject their autho 
rity are still built in violation of their precept in 
fact if contradiction remain a criterion of falsehood 
if logic and the laws of thought be not viewed as 
an illusion the philosophy of the absolute in all its 
forms admits of the most direct and easy refutation 
but on this matter i only now touch in order that 
you may not be ignorant that there are philosophers 
and philosophers of the highest name who in pursuit 
of the phantom of absolute knowledge are content 
to repudiate relative knowledge logic and the laws 
of thought this hallucination is however upon the 
wane and as each of these theorists contradicts his 
brother logic and common sense will at length re 
fute them all 

before leaving the consideration of this subject it 
is necessary to notice a mistake of dr reid which it 
is not more remarkable that he should have com 
mitted than that others have been found to follow and 
applaud it as the correction of a general error in 
the fourth essay on the intellectual poivers and in 
the third chapter entitled mistakes concerning con 
ception “ there is the following passage which at once 

a collected horto p — ed 


 



lectures on logic 


 


exhibits not only his own opinion but the universality lfct 
of the doctrine to which it is opposed — — 

“ there remains” he says “ another mistake con reid 
ceming conception which deserves to be noticed it qu ° w 
is that our conception of things is a test of their 
possibility so that what we can distinctly conceive 
we may conclude to be possible and of what is im 
possible we can have no conception 

“ this opinion has been held by philosophers for 
more than a hundred years without contradiction or 
dissent as far i know and if it be an error it 
may be of some use to inquire into its origin and 
the causes that it has been so generally received 
as a maxim whose truth could not be brought into 
doubt” 

i may here observe that this limitation of the pre 
valence of the opinion in question to a very modern 
period is altogether incorrect it was equally pre 
valent in ancient times and as many passages could 
easily be quoted from the greek logicians alone as 
dr reid has quoted from the philosophers of the cen 
tury prior to himself dr reid goes on — 

“ one of the fruitless questions agitated among the 
scholastic philosophers in the dark ages was — what 
is the criterion of truth as if men could have any 
other way to distinguish truth from error but by the 
right use of that power of judgment which god has 
given them 

“ descartes endeavoured to put an end to this con 
troversy by making it a fundamental principle in his 
system that whatever we clearly and distinctly per 
ceive is true 

“ to understand this principle of descartes it must 
be observed that he gave the name of perception to

every power of the human understanding and in 
explaining this very maxim he tells us that sense 
imagination and pure intellection are only different 
modes of perceiving and so the maxim was under 
stood by all his followers 

“the learned dr cud worth seems also to have 
adopted this principle ‘ the criterion of true know 
ledge he says ‘ is only to be looked for in our know 
ledge and conceptions themselves for the entity of 
all theoretical truth is nothing else but clear intel 
ligibility and whatever is clearly conceived is an 
entity and a truth but that which is false divine 
power itself cannot make it to be clearly and dis 
tinctly understood a falsehood can never be clearly 
conceived or apprehended to be true eternal and 
immutable morality p e 

“ this cartesian maxim seem to me to have led 
the way to that now under consideration which seems 
to have been adopted as the proper correction of the 
former when the authority of descartes declined 
men began to see that we may clearly and distinctly 
conceive what is not true but thought that our con 
ception though not in all cases a test of truth might 
be a test of possibility 

“ this indeed seems to be a necessary consequence 
of the received doctrine of ideas it being evident 
that there can be no distinct image either in the mind 
or anywhere else of that which is impossible the 
ambiguity of the word conceive which we observed 
essay i chap i and the common phraseology of 
saying we cannot conceive such a thing when we would 
signify that we think it impossible might likewise 
contribute to the reception of this doctrine 

“ but whatever was the origin of this opinion it

seems to prevail universally and to be received as a 
maxim 

“ ‘ the bare having an idea of the proposition 
proves the thing not to be impossible for of an im 
possible proposition there can be no idea’ — dr samuel 
clarke 

“ ‘ of that which neither does nor can exist we can 
have no idea’ — lord bolingbroke 

“ ‘ the measure of impossibility to us is inconceiv 
ableness that of which we can have no idea but that 
reflecting upon it it appears to be nothing we pro 
nounce to be impossible’ — abernethy 

“ ‘ in every idea is implied the possibility of the 
existence of its object nothing being clearer than that 
there can be no idea of an impossibility or conception 
of what cannot exist’ — dr price 

“ ‘ impossibile est cujus nullam notionem formare 
possumus possibile e contra cui aliqua respondet 
notio’ — wolfii ontolog 

“ ‘ it is an established maxim in metaphysics that 
whatever the mind conceives includes the idea of 
possible existence or in other words that nothing we 
imagine is absolutely impossible’ — d hume 

“ it were easy to muster up many other respectable 
authorities for this maxim and i have never found 
one that called it in question 

“if the maxim be true in the extent which the 
famous wolfius has given it in the passage above 
quoted we shall have a short road to the determina 
tion of every question about the possibility or impos 
sibility of things we need only look into our own 
breast and that like the urim and thummim will 
give an infallible answer if we can conceive the 
thing it is possible if not it is impossible and

lect surely every man may know whether he can conceive 
— what is affirmed or not 

“ other philosophers have been satisfied with one 
half of the maxim of wolfius they say that what 
ever we can conceive is possible but they do not 
say that whatever we cannot conceive is impossible” 

on this i may remark that dr keid s criticism of 
wolf must be admitted in so far as that philosopher 
maintains our inability to conceive a thing as possible 
to be the rule on which we are entitled to pronounce 
it impossible but dr iteid now advances a doctrine 
which i cannot but regard as radically erroneous 

“ i cannot help thinking even this to be a mis 
take which philosophers have been unwarily led into 
from the causes before mentioned my reasons are 
these — 

“ avhatever is said to be possible or impossible 
is expressed by a proposition now what is it to 
conceive a proposition i think it is no more than 
to understand distinctly its meaning i know no 
more that can be meant by simple apprehension or 
conception when applied to a proposition the 
axiom therefore amounts to this — every proposition 
of which you understand the meaning distinctly is 
possible i am persuaded that i understand as dis 
tinctly the meaning of this proposition any two sides 
of a triangle are together equal to the third as of this 
any two sides of a triangle are together greater than 
the third yet the first of these is impossible”

sense in which it has been always held by philoso 
phers that what is contradictory is conceived as 
inconceivable and impossible® no philosopher i

make bold to say ever dreamt of denying that we 
can distinctly understand the meaning of the pro 
position the terms of which we recognise to be con 
tradictory and as contradictory to annihilate each 
other when we enounce the proposition a is not 
a we clearly comprehend the separate meaning of the 
terms a and not a and also the import of the asser 
tion of their identity but this very understanding 
consists in the consciousness that the two terms are 
contradictories and that as such it is impossible to 
unite them in a mental judgment though they stand 
united in a verbal proposition if we attempt this 
the two mutually exclusive terms not only cannot be 
thought as one but in fact annihilate each other 
and thus the result in place of a positive judgment is 
a negation of thought so far dr reid is wrong 
but he is not guilty of the absurdity attributed 
to him by dr gleig he does not say as by that 
writer he is made to say that “any two sides of 
a triangle may be conceived to be equal to the third 
as distinctly as any two sides of a triangle may be 
conceived to be greater than the third” a these are 
not dr reid’s words and nothing he says warrants the 
attribution of such expressions to him in the sense in 
which they are attributed he is made to hold not 
merely that we can understand two terms as contra 
dictory but that we are able to combine them in the 
unity of thought after the passage already quoted 
reid goes on to illustrate in various points of view 
the supposed error of the philosophers but as all he 
says on this head originates in the misconception 
already shown of the opinion he controverts it is

postuiau we have thus considered the conditions of logic in 
tf l ° s ‘ c so far as certain laws or principles are prescribed we 
have now to consider its conditions in so far as cer 
tain postulates are demanded of these there are 
more than one but one alone it is here requisite to 
signalise for although it be necessarily supposed in 
the science strange to say it has by logical writers 
not only been always passed over in silence but 
frequently and inconsistently violated this postu 
late i comprise in the following paragraph — 

par xviii it xviii the only postulate of logic which re 
ikimuimo ™ quires an articulate enouncement is the demand 
that before dealing with a judgment or reasoning 
expressed in language the import of its terms 
should be fully understood in other words lo 
gic postulates to be allowed to state explicitly in 
language all that is implicitly contained in the 
thought 

tiii pot a this postulate cannot be refused in point of fact 
l refawl as i have said logic has always proceeded on it in 
overtly expressing all the steps of the mental process 
in reasoning — all the propositions of a syllogism 
whereas in common parlance one at least of these 
steps or propositions is usually left unexpressed 
this postulate as we shall have occasion to observe 
in the sequel though a fundamental condition of 
logic has not been consistently acted on by logicians 
in their development of the science and from this 
omission have arisen much confusion and deficiency 
and error in our present system of logic the illus

tration of this postulate will appropriately find its lect 
place on occasion of its applications i now articu 


lately state it because it immediately follows in order 
the general axioms of the science and at present i 
only beg that you will bear it in mind i may how thi pwtu 
ever before leaving the subject observe what has in tiijx 
already i believe been mentioned that aristotle iogi™ • 
states of syllogistic and of course his statement atilun’ii 
applies to logic in general that the doctrine of syllo 
gism deals not with the external expression of rea 
soning in ordinary language but w r ith the internal 
reasoning of the mind itself but of this again and 
more fully in the proper places 

in like manner we might here as is done in 
mathematics premise certain definitions but these 
it will be more convenient to state as they occur in 
the progress of our development i therefore pass 
on to the second section of the doctrine of elements 
which is occupied with the products of thought in 
other words with the processes regulated by the pre 
vious conditions

i ennoematio — of concepts or notions 

a of concepts in general 

i concluded in my last lecture all that i think it 
necessary to say in regard to the fundamental laws of 
thought or the necessary conditions of the thinkable 
the discussion i am aware must have been found 
somewhat dry and even abstruse not that there is the 
smallest difficulty in regard to the apprehension of 
the laws themselves for these are all selfevident pro 
positions but because though it is necessary in a 
systematic view of logic to commence with the 
elementary principles of thought it is impossible in 
speaking of these and their application not to employ 
expressions of the most abstract generality and even 
not to suppose a certain acquaintance with words and 
things which however only find their explanation in 
the subsequent development of the science 

having considered therefore the four laws of 
thought with the one postulate of logic which con 
stituted the first section of the doctrine of lo 
gical elements i now proceed to the second — that 
which is conversant about logical products these

products though identical in kind are of three differ lect 
ent degrees for while concepts judgments and vu ‘ 


reasonings are all equally the products of the same 
faculty of comparison they still fall into three classes 
as the act and consequently the result of the act is 
of a greater or a less simplicity these three degrees mcnt ’ 
are all in fact strictly only modifications of the 
second as both concepts and reasonings may be 
reduced to judgments for the act of judging that is 
the act of affirming or denying one thing of another 
in thought is that in which the understanding or 
faculty of comparison is essentially expressed by 
anticipation — a concept is a judgment for on the 
one hand it is nothing but the result of a foregone 
judgment or series of judgments fixed and recorded 
in a word — a sign and it is only amplified by the 
annexation of a new attribute through a continuance 
of the same process on the other hand as a concept 
is thus the synthesis or complexion and the record i 
may add of one or more prior acts of judgment it 
can it is evident be analysed into these again every 
concept is in fact a judgment or a fasciculus of judg 
ments — these judgments only not explicitly developed 
in thought and not formally expressed in terms 

again a reasoning is a judgment for a reasoning 
is only the affirmation of the connection of two things 
with a third and through that third with each other 

it is thus only the same function of thought which is 
at work in conception judgment and reasoning and 
these express no real no essential distinction of opera 
tion but denote only the different relations in which 
we may regard the indivisible act of thought thus 
the consideration of concepts cannot be effected out of 
all relation to and without even some anticipation of 
the doctrine of judgments this being premised i

in latin the word concipere in its many various 
applications always expresses as the etymology would 
indicate the process of embracing or comprehending 
the many into the one as could be shown by an 
articulate analysis of the phrases in which the term 
occurs it was accordingly under this general signi

and other roman writers means to comprehend or

thought and animi conceptus was in like manner 
applied by the ancient writers to denote this operation 
or its result the employment of concipere conceptus 
and conception as technical terms in the philosophy of 
mind without the explanatory adjunct was of a later

had been long familiarly used in a psychological rela

sense or imagination not indeed that examples 
enough may not be adduced of their abusive applica 
tion to our immediate cognitions of individual objects 
long before mr stewart formally applied the term 
conception to a certain accidental form of representa 
tion — to the simple reproduction or repetition of an 
act of perception in imagination in using the terms 
conception and concept in the sense which i have ex 
plained i therefore employ them not only in strict 
conformity to their grammatical meaning but to the 
meaning which they have generally obtained among 
philosophers 

the term notion like conception expresses both an the term 
act and its product i shall however as has com how em

this word has like conception been sometimes abus 
ively applied to denote not only our knowledge of 
things by their common characters but likewise to 
include the mere presentations of sense and represen 
tations of phantasy this abusive employment has 
however not been so frequent in reference to this 
term as to the term conception but it must be ac 
knowledged that nothing can be imagined more vague 
and vacillating than the meaning attached to notion 
in the writings of all british philosophers without

the two following cognitions — ° the immediate 
and irrespective knowledge we have of the indi 
vidual object as a complement of certain qualities 
or characters considered simply as belonging to 
itself ° the mediate and relative knowledge 
we have of this object as comprising qualities or 
characters common to it with other objects 

the former of these cognitions is that contained 
in the presentations of sense external and inter 
nal and representations of imagination they 
are only of the individual or singular the latter 
is that contained in the concepts of the under 
standing and is a knowledge of the common 
general or universal 

the conceiving an object is therefore its re 
cognition mediately through a concept and a 
concept is the cognition or idea of the general 
character or characters point or points in which 
a plurality of objects coincide 

this requires some illustration and it will be best 
afforded by considering the history of our knowledge 
our mental activity is not first exerted in an appre

us in confused and imperfect perceptions the rude

vation of this fact determines a reflective consider auc “ tln 
ation of their properties objects are intentionally 
compared together for the purpose of discovering their 
similarities and differences when things are found to 
agree or to disagree in certain respects the conscious 
ness is by an act of volition concentrated upon the 
objects which thus partially agree and in them upon 
those qualities in or through which they agree and 
by this concentration — which constitutes the act 
called attention — what is effected on the objects 
and qualities thus attentively considered a strong 
light is shed but precisely in proportion as these arc 
illuminated in consciousness the others to which we 
do not attend are thrown into obscurity

upon certain qualities is thus to withdraw or abstract iabtrc

prescind the phaenomena which we exclusively con tiic uno

when we are said to prescind a quality we are merely 
supposed to attend to that quality exclusively and 
when we abstract we are properly said to abstract 
from that is to throw other attributes out of account

by comparison the points of resemblance among 
things being thus discovered and by attention consti 
tuted into exclusive objects by the same act they 
are also reduced in consciousness from multitude to 
unity what is meant by this will be apparent from 
the following considerations 

we are conscious to ourselves that we can repeat 
our acts of consciousness — that we can think the 
same thought over and over this act or this 
thought is always in reality the same though mani 
fested at different times for no one can imagine that 
in the repetition of one and the same thought he has 
a plurality of thoughts for he is conscious that it is 
one and the same thought which is repeated so long 
as its contents remain identical 

now this relation of absolute similarity which sub 
sists between the repetitions of the same thought is 
found to hold between our representations of the 
resembling qualities of objects two objects have 
similar qualities only as these qualities afford a similar 
presentation in sense or a similar representation in 
imagination and qualities are to us completely simi 
lar when we are unable to distinguish their cognitions 
but what we cannot distinguish is to us the same 
therefore objects which determine undistinguishable 
impressions upon us are perceived and represented in 
the same mental modification and are subjectively to 
us precisely as if they were objectively identical

but the consciousness of identity is not merely the 
result of the indiscernible similarity of total objects 
it is equally the result of the similarity of any of their 
parts — partial characters for by abstracting observa 
tion from the qualities points in which objects differ 
and limiting it to those in which they agree we are 
able to consider them as identical in certain respects 
however diverse they may appear to be in others 
which for the moment we throw out of view for 
example let b c and d represent a series of indivi 
dual objects which all agree in possessing the resem 
bling attributes of y y y and severally differ in each 
respectively possessing the nonresembling attributes

scious of their resembling qualities y y y but 
in the second place the qualities expressed by 
y y y t y determine in us cognitive energies which we 
are unable to distinguish and which we therefore 
consider as the same we therefore view the three 
similar qualities in the three different objects as also 
identical we consider the y in this the y in that 
and the y in the third object as one and in so far as 
the three objects participate in this oneness or iden 
tity we regard them also as the same in other 
words we classify b c and d under y y is the 
genus b c and d are its individuals or species seve

pared together and their points of resemblance noted 
exclusively considered and reduced to one in the 
synthesis of thought this process is called general 
isation that is the process of evolving the general

style of general notions — general conceptions this 
is superfluous for in propriety of speech notions and 
concepts are in their very nature general while the 
other cognitive modifications to which they are op 
posed — perceptions and imaginations — have in like 
manner their essence in their individuality 

by the way you may have noticed that i never use

dividuality and immediacy the germans express lect 
this by the term anschauung which can only be — ll 
translated by intuition as it is in latin by germans 
which literally means a looking at this expression 
has however been preoccupied in english to denote 
the apprehension we have of selfevident truths and 
its application in a different signification would there 
fore be to a certain extent liable to ambiguity i 
shall therefore continue for the present at least to 
struggle on without such a common term though the 
necessity thus imposed of always opposing presenta 
tion and representation to concept is both tedious and 
perplexing

this is too simple to require any commentary it explication 
is evident that when we think socrates by any of the 
concepts — athenian greek european man biped 
animal being — we throw out of view the far greater 
number of characters of which socrates is the com 
plement and those likewise which more proximately 
determine or constitute his individuality it is like 
wise evident that in proportion as we think him by a 
more general concept we shall represent him by a 
smaller bundle of attributes and consequently repre 
sent him in a more partial and onesided manner 

thus if we think him as athenian we shall think 
him by a greater number of qualities than if we think

mystery of generalisation and general terms for the 
whole disputes between the conceptualists and no 
minalists to say nothing of the realists have only 
arisen from concepts having been regarded as afford 
ing an irrespective and independent object of thought 
this illusion has arisen from a very simple circum 
stance objects compared together are found to pos 
sess certain attributes which as producing indiscern 
ible modifications in us are to us absolutely similar 
they are therefore considered the same the relation 
of similarity is thus converted into identity and the 
real plurality of resembling qualities in nature is 
factitiously reduced to a unity in thought and this 
unity obtains a name in which its relativity not being

selves any of these concepts any of these abstract 
generalities as absolute objects by themselves and 
out of relation to any concrete or individual realities 
their relative nature at once reappears for we find it 
altogether impossible to represent any of the qualities 
expressed by a concept except as attached to some 
individual and determinate object and their whole 
generality consists in this — that though we must 
realise them in thought under some singular of the 
class we may do it under any thus for example 
we cannot actually represent the bundle of attributes 
contained in the concept man as an absolute object 
by itself and apart from all that reduces it from a 
general cognition to an individual representation 
we cannot figure in imagination any object adequate 
to the general notion or term man for the man to be 
here imagined must be neither tall nor short neither 
fat nor lean neither black nor white neither man nor 
woman neither young nor old but all and yet none 
of these at once the relativity of our concepts is 
thus shown in the contradiction and absurdity of the 
opposite hypothesis

stoicheiology 

sect ii — of the products of thought 

i — ennoematic 

a of concepts in general b in special — i their 
objective relation— quantity 

in our last lecture we began the second section of 
stoicheiology — the consideration of the products of 
thought the product of thought may be considered 
as concepts as judgments and as reasonings these 
however are not to be viewed as the results of dif 
ferent faculties far less as processes independent of 
each other for they are all only the product of the 
bame energy in different degrees or rather in sim 
pler or more complex application to its objects 

id treating of concepts which form the subject of 
the first chapter of this second section i stated that 
i should first consider them in general and then con 
sider them in special and in my last lecture i had 
nearly concluded all that i deem it requisite under 
the former head to state in regard to their peculiar 
character their origin and their general accidents 
i first of all explained the meaning of the two terms 
concept and notion words convertible with each other 
but still severally denoting a different aspect of the 
simple operation which they equally express notion 
being relative to and expressing the apprehension — 
the remarking — the taking note of the resembling

attributes in objects concept the grasping up or 
synthesis of these in the unity of thought 

having shown what was properly expressed by the 
terms notion and concept or conception i went on to 
a more articulate explanation of that which they were 
employed to denote and here i again stated what 
a concept or notion is in itself and in contrast to a 
presentation of perception or eepresentation of phan 
tasy our knowledge through either of the latter is 
a direct immediate irrespective determinate indivi 
dual and adequate cognition that is a singular or 
individual object is known in itself by itself through 
all its attributes and without reference to aught but 
itself a concept on the contrary is an indirect 
mediate relative indeterminate and partial cognition 
of any one of a number of objects but not an actual 
representation either of them all or of the whole 
attributes of any one object 

though it be not strictly within the province of 
logic to explain the origin and formation of our 
notions the logician assuming as data the laws and 
products of thought as the mathematician assumes 
as data extension and number and the axioms by 
which their relation is determined both leaving to 
the metaphysician the inquiry into their grounds — 
this notwithstanding i deemed it not improper to 
give you a very brief statement of the mode and cir 
cumstances in which our concepts are elaborated out 
of the presentations and representations of the sub 
sidiary faculties different objects are complements 
partly of similar partly of different attributes simi 
lar qualities are those which stand in similar relation 
to our organs and faculties and where the similarity 
is complete the effects which they determine in us 
are by us indiscernible to us they are therefore

virtually the same and the same we accordingly con 
sider them to be though in different objects pre 
cisely as we consider the thought of the same object 
to be itself the same when repeated at intervals — at 
different times — in consciousness this by way of 
preface being understood i showed that in the for 
mation of a concept or notion the process may be 
analysed into four momenta in the first place we 
must have a plurality of objects presented or repre 
sented by the subsidiary faculties these faculties 
must furnish the rude material for elaboration in 
the second place the objects thus supplied are by an 
act of the understanding compared together and their 
several qualities judged to be similar or dissimilar 
in the third place an act of volition called attention 
concentrates consciousness on the qualities thus re 
cognised as similar and that concentration by atten 
tion on them involves an abstraction of consciousness 
from those which have been recognised and thrown 
aside as dissimilar for the power of consciousness 
is limited and it is clear or vivid precisely in propor 
tion to the simplicity or oneness of its object atten 
tion and abstraction are the two poles of the same 
act of thought they are like the opposite scales in a 
balance the one must go up as the other goes down 
in the fourth place the qualities which by compari 
son are judged similar and by attention are consti 
tuted into an exclusive object of thought — these are 
already by this process identified in consciousness 
for they are only judged similar inasmuch as they 
produce in us indiscernible effects their synthesis 
in consciousness may however for precisions sake be 
stated as a fourth step in the process but it must be 
remembered that at least the three latter steps are

not in reality distinct and independent acts but are 
only so distinguished and stated in order to enable 
us to comprehend and speak about the indivisible 
operation in the different aspects in which we may 
consider it in the same way you are not to sup 
pose that the mental sentence which must be analysed 
in order to be expressed in language has as many 
parts in consciousness as it has words or clauses 
in speech for it forms in reality one organic and 
indivisible whole to repeat an illustration i have 
already given — the parts of an act of thought stand 
in the same relation to each other as the parts of a 
triangle — a figure which we cannot resolve into any 
simpler figure but whose sides and angles we may 
consider apart and therefore as parts though these 
are in reality inseparable being the necessary condi 
tions of each other — but this by the way 

the qualities of different individual things thus 
identified in thought and constituting concepts under 
which as classes these individual things themselves 
are ranged — these primary concepts may themselves 
be subjected to the same process by which they were 
elaborated from the concrete realities given in per 
ception and imagination we may again compare 
different concepts together again find in the plurality 
of attributes which they comprehend some like some 
unlike we may again attend only to the similar and 
again identify these in the synthesis of consciousness 
and this process of evolving concepts out of concepts 
we may go on performing until the generalisation is 
arrested in that ultimate or primary concept the 
basis itself of all attributes — the concept of being or 
existence 

having thus endeavoured to give you a general

lfct view of what concepts are and by what process they 

 are formed i stated by way of corollary some of their 

general characteristics the first of these i mentioned 
is their partiality or inadequacy — that is they com 
prehend only a larger or smaller portion of the whole 
attributes belonging to the things classified or con 
tained under them 

relativity the second is their relativity formed by compari 

of concept gon ex p ress only a relation they cannot there 
fore be held up as an absolute object to consciousness 
— they cannot be represented as universals in ima 
gination they can only be thought of in relation to 
some one of the individual objects they classify and 
when viewed in relation to it they can be represented 
in imagination but then as so actually represented 
they no longer constitute general attributions they fall 
back into mere special determinations of the individual 
object in which they are represented thus it is that 
the generality or universality of concepts is potential 
not actual they are only generals inasmuch as they 
may be applied to any of the various objects they 
contain but while they cannot be actually elicited 
into consciousness except in application to some one 
or other of these so they cannot be so applied with 
out losing pro tanto their universality take for 
example the concept horse in so far as by horse we 
merely think of the word that is of the combination 
formed by the letters h o r s e — this is not a con 
cept at all as it is a mere representation of certain 
individual objects this only state and eliminate 
in order that no possible ambiguity should be allowed 
to lurk by horse then meaning not merely a re 
presentation of the word but a concept relative to 
certain objects classed under it — the concept horse

i say cannot if it remain a concept that is a uni 
versal attribution be represented in imagination 
but except it be represented in imagination it cannot 
be applied to any object and except it be so applied 
it cannot be realised in thought at all you may try 
to escape the horns of the dilemma but you cannot 
you cannot realise in thought an absolute or irre 
spective concept corresponding in universality to the 
application of the word for the supposition of this 
involves numerous contradictions an existent horse 
is not a relation but an extended object possessed of 
a determinate figure colour size etc horse in 
general cannot therefore be represented except by 
an image of something extended and of a determinate 
figure colour size etc here now emerges the con 
tradiction if on the one hand you do not represent 
something extended and of a determinate figure 
colour and size you have no representation of any 
horse there is therefore on this alternative nothing 
which can be called the actual concept or image of a 
horse at all if on the other hand you do represent 
something extended and of a determinate figure 
colour and size then you have indeed the image of 
an individual horse but not a universal concept co 
adequate with horse in general for how is it pos 
sible to have an actual representation of a figure 
which is not a determinate figure but if of a deter 
minate figure it must be that of some one of the 
many different figures under which horses appear 
but then if it be only of one of these it cannot be the 
general concept of the others which it does not repre 
sent in like manner how is it possible to have the 
actual representation of a thing coloured which is 
not the representation of a determinate colour that is

either white or black or grey or brown etc but if it 
be any one of these it can only represent a horse of 
this or that particular colour and cannot be the 
general concept of horses of every colour the same 
result is given by the other attributes and what i 
originally stated is thus manifest — that concepts have 
only a potential not an actual universality that is 
they are only universal inasmuch as they may be 
applied to any of a certain class of objects but as 
actually applied they are no longer general attribu 
tions but only special attributes 

but it does not from this follow that concepts are 
mere words and that there is nothing general in 
thought itself this is not indeed held in reality by 
any philosopher for no philosopher has ever denied 
that we are capable of apprehending relations and in 
particular the relation of similarity and difference so 
that the whole controversy between the conceptualist 
and nominalist originates in the ambiguous employ 
ment of the same terms to express the representations 
of imagination and the notions or concepts of the 
understanding this is significantly shown by the 
absolute nonexistence of the dispute among the philo 
sophers of the most metaphysical country in europe 
in germany the question of nominalism and concep 
tualism has not been agitated and why simply be 
cause the german language supplies terms by which 
concepts or notions of thought proper have been

logic and i have only been led now to recur to it lect

me by members of the class — all that i wish you 
now to understand is — that concepts as the result of 
comparison that is of the apprehension and affirma

operations perceived for the apprehension of the causal connec 
tion of certain things and for the application of this 
knowledge to the attainment of certain ends no lan 
guage is necessary and it is only the exaggeration 
of a truth into an error when philosophers maintain 
that language is the indispensable condition of even 
the simpler energies of knowledge language is the 
attribution of signs to our cognitions of things but 
as a cognition must have been already there before it 
could receive a sign consequently that knowledge 
which is denoted by the formation and application of 
a word must have preceded the symbol which denotes 
it speech is thus not the mother but the godmother 
of knowledge but though in general we must hold 
that language as the product and correlative of 
thought must be viewed as posterior to the act 
of thinking itself on the other hand it must be 
admitted that we could never have risen above the 
very lowest degrees in the scale of thought without 
the aid of signs a sign is necessary to give stability

i here terminate the general and proceed to the 
special consideration of concepts — that is to view 
them in their several relations now in a logical 
point of view there are it seems to me only three 
possible relations in which concepts can be considered 
for the only relations they hold are to their objects to 
their subject or to each other in relation to their 
objects — they are considered as inclusive of a greater 
or smaller number of attributes that is as applicable 
to a greater or smaller number of objects this is tech 
nically styled their quantity in relation to their 
subject that is to the mind itself they are considered 
as standing in a higher or a lower degree of conscious 
ness — they are more or less clear more or less distinct 
this in like manner is called their quality in rela 
tion to each other they are considered as the same or 
different coordinated or subordinated to each other 
this is their relation strictly so called® under these 
three heads i now therefore proceed to treat them 
and first of their quantity

the internal quantity of a notion — its intension 
or comprehension is made up of those different attri 
butes of which the concept is the conceived sum 
that is the various characters connected by the con 
cept itself into a single whole in thought the 
external quantity of a notion or its extension is on 
the other hand made up of the number of objects 
which are thought mediately through a concept for 
example the attributes rational sensible moral etc 
go to constitute the intension or internal quantity of 
the concept man whereas the attributes european 
american philosopher tailor etc go to make up a 
concept of this or that individual man these two 
quantities are not convertible on the contrary they 
are in the inverse ratio of each other the greater the 
depth or comprehension of a notion the less its breadth 
or extension and vice versd you will observe like 
wise a distinction which has been taken by the best 
logicians both quantities are said to contain but 
the quantity of extension is said to contain under it 
the quantity of comprehension is said to contain in it 

by the intension comprehension or depth of a 
notion we think the most qualities of the fewest ob

again you will observe the two following distinc 
tions the first — the exposition of the comprehen 
sion of a notion is called its definition a simple 
notion cannot therefore be defined the second — 
the exposition of the extension of a notion is called its 
division an individual notion cannot be divided 

what follows is in further illustration of the para serial 
graph notions or concepts stand in a necessary rela oftw° n 
tion to certain objects thought through them for with concept i ft 
out something to think of there could exist no thought qi “““ ly ‘ 
no notion no concept but in so far as we think an 
object through a concept we think it as part of or 
as contained under that concept and in so far as we 
think a concept of its object or objects we think it as 
a unity containing actually or potentially in it a 
plurality of attributions out of the relation of a 
concept to its object it necessarily results that a 
concept is a quantum or quantity for that which con 
tains one or more units by which it may be measured 
is a quantity 

but the quantity of a concept is of two and two ra 
opposite kinds considered internally that is as a lini i 
unity which may and generally does contain in it a 
plurality of parts or component attributes a concept 
has a certain quantity which may be called its internal 
or intensive quantity this is generally called its 
comprehension sometimes its depth fiados and its 
quantilas complexus here the parts that is the 
several attributes or characters which go to constitute 
the total concept are said to be contained in it for 
example the concept man is composed of two con

concepts — rational and animal for the characters 
rational and animal are only an analytical expression 
of the synthetic unity of the concept man but each 
of these partial concepts which together make up the 
comprehension of the total concept man are them 
selves wholes in like manner made up of parts to 
take only the concept animal — this comprehends in 
it as parts living and sensitive and organised for a 
living and sentient organism may be considered as an 
analytical development of the constituents of the syn 
thetic unity animal but each of these again is a con 
cept comprehending and made up of parts and these 
parts again are relative wholes divisible into other 
constituent concepts nor need we stop in our analy 
sis till we reach attributes which as simple stand as 
a primary or ultimate element into which the series 
can be resolved now you will observe that as the 
parts of the parts are parts of the w r hole the concept 
man as immediately comprehending the concepts 
rational and animal mediately comprehends their 
parts and the parts of their parts to the end of the 
evolution thus we can say not only that man is 
an animal but that he is a living being a sentient 
being etc the logical axiom nota notce est not a rei 
ipsius or as otherwise expressed prcedicatum prce 
dicati est prcedicatum subjecti a — is only a special 
enunciation of the general principle that the part of a 
part is a part of the whole you will hereafter see 
that the comprehension of notions affords one of the 
two great branches of reasoning which though mar 
vellously overlooked by logicians is at least of equal

importance with that which they have exclusively 
developed and which is founded on the other kind of 
quantity exhibited by concepts and to which i now 
proceed 

but a concept may also be considered externally 
that is as a unity which contains under it a plurality 
of classifying attributes or subordinate concepts and 
in this respect it has another quantity which may be 
called its extncd or extensive quantity this is 
commonly called its extension sometimes its sphere 
or domain splicer a regio quantitas ambitus and 
by the greek logicians its breadth or latitude rxa 
to a here the parts which the total concept contains 
are said to be contained under it because holding 
the relation to it of the particular to the general they 
are subordinated or ranged tmder it for example 
the concepts man horse dog c are contained 
under the more general concept animal — the con 
cepts triangle square circle rhombus rhomboid c 
are contained under the more general concept figure 
inasmuch as the subordinate concepts can each or 
any be thought through the higher or more general 
but as each of these subordinate concepts is itself a 
whole or general which contains under it parts or 
more particular concepts it follows again on the 
axiom or selfevident truth that a part of a part is a 
part of the whole — an axiom which you will here 
after see constitutes the one principle of all deductive 
reasoning — it follows on this axiom that whatever 
is contained under the partial or more particular con 
cept is contained under the total or more general 
concept thus for example triangle is contained 
under figure all therefore that is contained under

viil will likewise be contained under figure by which we 
may accordingly think and describe them 

such in general is what is meant by the two 
quantities of concepts — their comprehension and 
extension 

intensive but these quantities are not only different they are 
“’ opposed and so opposed that though each supposes 
opposstto the other as the condition of its own existence still 
each other however w irtd n the limits of conjunct of correlative 

existence they stand in an inverse ratio to each other

the comprehension of a concept a minimum 
that is is the concept one in which a plurality 
of attributes can no longer be distinguished it 
is called simple whereas inasmuch as its attri 
butes still admit of discrimination it is called 
complex or compound a 

a notion is extensively great in proportion to 
the greater number and extensively small in 
proportion to the smaller number of determina

the extension of a concept becomes a minimum 
that is when it contains no other notions under 
it it is called an individual 

these two quantities stand always in an inverse

hension of a concept the less is its extension v 
and the greater its extension the less its compre 
hension 


to illustrate this — when i take out of a concept lustration 
that is abstract from one or more of its attributes i 
diminish its comprehension thus when from the 
concept man equivalent to rational animal i abstract 
from the attribute or determination rational i lessen 
its internal quantity but by this diminution of its 
comprehension i give it a wider extension for what 
remains is the concept animal and the concept animal 
embraces under it a far greater number of objects than 
the concept man

the reason ot this opposition of the two quantities 
is manifest in a moment from the consideration of 
their several natures the comprehension of a con 
cept is nothing more than a sum or complement 
of the distinguishing characters attributes of which 
the concept is made up and the extension of a 
concept is nothing more than the sum or complement 
of the objects themselves whose resembling characters 
were abstracted to constitute the concept now it 
is evident that the more distinctive characters the 
concept contains the more minutely it will distinguish 
and determine and that if it contain a plenum of 
distinctive characters it must contain the distinctive 
— the determining characters of some individual ob 
ject how do the two quantities now stand in 
regard to the comprehension or depth it is evident 
that it is here at its maximum the concept being a 
complement of the whole attributes of an individual 
object which by these attributes it thinks and dis 
criminates from every other on the contrary the 
extension or breadth of the concept is here at its 
minimum for as the extension is great in propor 
tion to the number of objects to which the concept 
can be applied and as the object is here only an indi 
vidual one it is evident that it could not be less 
without ceasing to exist at all again to reverse 
the process — throwing out of the comprehension of 
the concept that is abstracting from those attri 
butes which belonging exclusively to exclusively 
distinguish the individual — we at once diminish 
the comprehension by reducing the sum of its at 
tributes and amplify the extension of the concept 
by bringing within its sphere all the objects which

sion had previously excluded from the extension lect 
continuing the process by abstraction we throw out u 
of the sum of qualities constituting the comprehension 
other discriminating attributes and forthwith the 
extension is proportionally amplified by the entrance 
into its sphere of all those objects which had pre 
viously been debarred by the determining character 
istics last discarded thus proceeding and at each 
step ejecting from the comprehension those characters 
which are found the proximate impediments to the 
amplification of the extension of the concept we at 
each step diminish the former quantity precisely as 
we increase the latter till at last we arrive at that 
concept which is the necessary constituent of every 
other — at that concept which all comprehension and 
all extension must equally contain but in which com 
prehension is at its minimum extension at its maxi 
mum — i mean the concept of being or existence 

we have thus seen that the maximum of compre definition 
hension and the minimum of extension are found in sion — are 
the concept of an individual — that the maximum of ex ceww by

are of an opposite nature it is manifest that the two 
processes of analysis will likewise be opposed the 
analysis of the intensive or comprehensive quantity 
of concepts that is their depth is accomplished by 
definition that of their extensive quantity or breadth 
by division on definition and division i at present 
touch not to consider them in themselves or on their 
own account that is as the methods of clear and of dis 
tinct thinking for this will form the matter of a special 
discussion in the second part of logic or methodology 
but simply in so far as it is requisite to speak of them 
in illustration of the general nature of our concepts 

the expository or explanatory analysis of a concept 
considered as an intensive whole or quantum if pro 
perly effected is done by its resolution into two con 
cepts of which it is proximately compounded that is 
into the higher concept under which it immediately 
stands and into the concept w r hich affords the char 
acter by which it is distinguished from the other co 
ordinate concepts under that higher concept this is 
its definition that is in logical language its expo 
sition by an analysis into its genus and differential 
quality — the genus being the higher concept under 
which it stands the differential quality the lower 
concept by which it is distinguished from the other 
concepts subordinate to the genus and on a level or 
coordinate with itself and which in logical language 
are called species for example if we attempt an 
expository or explanatory analysis of the concept 
marly considered as an intensive quantity or corn 
plexus of attributes we analyse it into animal this 
being the higher concept or genus under which it 
stands — and into rational the attribute of reason 
being the characteristic or differential quality by 


 


lectures on logic 


 


which man is distinguished from the other concepts lect 

or species which stand coordinated with itself under u 

the genus animal — that is irrational animal or brute 

here you will observe that though the analysis be 
of the comprehension yet it is regulated by the exten 
sion the extension regulating the order in which the 
comprehension is resolved into its parts 

the expository analysis of a concept an extensive diviion 
whole or quantum is directly opposed to the preceding 
to which it is correlative it takes the higher con 
cept and if conducted aright resolves it into its proxi 
mately lower concepts by adding attributes which 
afford their distinguishing characters or differences 

this is division — thus for example taking the high 
est concept that of ens or existence by adding to it the 
differential concepts per se or substantial and non per 
se or accidental we have substantial existence or exist 
ence per se equivalent to substance and accidental 
existence or existence non per se equivalent to acci 
dent we may then divide substance by simple and 
notsimple equivalent to compound and again simple 
by material and nonmaterial equivalent to imma 
terial equivalent to spiritual — and matter or material 
substance by organised and notorganised equivalent 
to brute matter organised matter we may divide by 
sentient or animal and non sentient or vegetable 
animal we may divide by rational and irrational and 
so on till we reach a concept which as that of an 
individual object is in fact not a general concept 
but only in propriety a singular representation 

thus it is manifest that as definition is the analysis the inio 
of a complex concept into its component parts or attri ixlbk 
butes if a concept be simple that is if it contain in 
it only a single attribute it must be indefinable and

again that as division is the analysis of a higher or 
more general concept into others lower and less gen 
eral if a concept be an individual that is only a 
bundle of individual qualities it is indivisible is in 
fact not a proper or abstract concept at all but only 
a concrete representation of imagination

gplars every higher class or more common attribute 
is supposed in conformity with logical precision to 
be dichotomised — to be divided into two by a lower 
class or attribute and its contradictory or negative 
this contradictory of which only the commencement 
appears is marked by an italic vowel preceded by a 
perpendicular line signifying not or non and 
analogous to the minus — of the mathematicians 
this being understood the table at once exhibits the 
real identity and rational differences of breadth and 
depth which though denominated quantities are in 
reality one and the same quantity viewed in counter 
relations and from opposite ends nothing is the 
one which is not pro tanto the other 

in breadth the supreme genus a a c is as 
it appeal’s absolutely the greatest whole an indivi 
dual z absolutely the smallest part whereas the 
intermediate classes are each of them a relative part 
or species by reference to the class and classes above 
it a relative whole or genus by reference to the class 
or classes below it — in depth the individual is ab 
solutely the greatest whole the highest genus is abso 
lutely the smallest part whilst every relatively lower 
class or species is relatively a greater whole than the 
class classes or genera above it — the two quantities 
are thus as the diagram represents precisely the in 
verse of each other the greater the breadth the 
less the depth the greater the depth the less the 
breadth and each within itself affording the corre 
lative differences of whole and part each therefore in 
opposite respects contains and is contained but for 
distinction’s sake it is here convenient to employ a 
difference not altogether arbitrary of expression 
we should say — “containing and contained under”

for breadth — “ containing and contained in” for 
depth this distinction which has been taken by 
some modern logicians though unknown to many 
of them was not observed by aristotle we find 
him to say nothing of other ancient logicians using 
the expression iv oco etuai or vna px elv for either 
whole though different in the order of thought 
 ratione the two quantities are identical in the 
nature of things re each supposes the other and 
breadth is not more to be distinguished from depth 
than the relations of the sides from the relations of 
the angles of a triangle in effect it is precisely the 
same reasoning whether we argue in depth — “ z is 
ie as subject contains in it the inherent attribute 
some y all y is some u all u is some all 
is some i all i is some e all e is some a — there 
fore z is some a or whether we argue in breadth — 
“ some a is ie as class contains under it the subject 
part all e some e is all i some i is all some 
is all u some u is all y some y is z — therefore 
some a is z” the two reasonings internally identi 
cal are externally the converse of each other the 
premise and term which in breadth is major in 
depth is minor in syllogisms also where the con 
trast of the two quantities is abolished there with 
the difference of figure the differences of major and 
minor premise and term fall likewise in truth how 
ever common language in its enouncement of pro 
positions is here perhaps more correct and philoso 
phical than the technical language of logic itself 
for as it is only an equation — only an affiliation of 
identity or its negation which is in either quantity 
proposed therefore the substantive verb is is not 
used in both cases speaks more accurately than the

lect perfection or imperfection of a notion it is this 

 v perfection or imperfection which constitutes the 

logical quality of a concept® 

it is thus the greater or smaller degree of conscious 
ness which accompanies the concept and its object 
that determines its quality and according to which it 
is called logically perfect or logically imperfect now 
there may be distinguished two degrees of this logical 
perfection the nature of which is summarily expressed 
in the following paragraph 


par xxviii 
the two 
degrees of 
the logical 
perfection 
and imper 
fection of 
concepts — 
their clear 
ness and 
distinct 
ness and 
their ob 
scurity and 
indistinct 
ness 


if xxviii there are two degrees of the logical 
perfection of concepts — viz their clearness and 
their distinctness and consequently two opposite 
degrees of their corresponding imperfection — viz 
their obscurity and their indistinctness these 
four qualities express the perfection and imper 
fection of concepts in extremes but between 
these extremes there lie an indefinite number of 
intermediate degrees 

a concept is said to be clear clara when 
the degree of consciousness is such as enables 
us to distinguish it as a whole from others 
and obscure obscura when the degree of con 
sciousness is insufficient to accomplish this a 
concept is said to be distinct distincta per 
spicua when the degree of consciousness is such 
as enables us to discriminate from each other the 
several characters or constituent parts of which 
the concept is the sum and indistinct or con 
fused indistincta confusa imperspicua when 
the amount of consciousness requisite for this is

of a change — we see something but are still unable 
to distinguish its features — we know not what it is

appear but still not with a distinctness sufficient to 
allow us to perceive them completely but when this 
is rendered possible by the rising intensity of the 
light we are then said to see clearly we then recog

fully sprung we are enabled likewise to discriminate 
their parts we now see distinctly what lies around 
us but still we see as yet only the wholes which 
lie proximately around us and of these only the 
parts which possess a certain size the more distant 
wholes and the smaller parts of nearer wholes are 
still seen by us only in their conjoint result only as 
they concur in making up that whole which is for us 
a visible minimum thus it is that in the distant 
forest or the distant hill we perceive a green surface 
but we see not the several leaves which in the one 
nor the several blades of grass which in the other 
each contributes its effect to produce that amount of 
impression which our consciousness requires thus it 
is that all which we do perceive is made up of parts 
which we do not perceive and consciousness is itself 
a complement of impressions which lie beyond its 
apprehension clearness and distinctness are thus 
only relative for between the extreme of obscurity 
and the extreme of distinctness there are in vision an 
infinity of intermediate degrees now the same thing 
occurs in thought for we may either be conscious 
only of the concept in general or we may also be 
conscious of its various constituent attributes or both 
the concept and its parts may be lost in themselves to 
consciousness and only recognised to exist by effects 
which indirectly evidence their existence 

the perfection of a notion as i said is contained in 
two degrees or in two virtues — viz in its clearness 
and in its distinctness and of course the opposite 
vices of obscurity and indistinctness afford two de 
grees or two vices constituting its imperfection “ a 
concept is said to be clear when the degree of con 
sciousness by which it is accompanied is sufficient to

discriminate what we think in and through it from lect 

what we think in and through other notions whereas 

if the degree of consciousness be so remiss that this 
and other concepts run into each other in that case 
the notion is said to be obscure it is evident that 
clearness and obscurity admit of various degrees 
each being capable of almost infinite gradations ac 
cording as the object of the notion is discriminated 
with greater or less vivacity and precision from the 
objects of other notions a concept is absolutely tic i 
clear when its object is distinguished from all other and ii™ 
objects a concept is absolutely obscure when its ob iiw ° b 
ject can be distinguished from no other object but 
it is only the absolutely clear and the absolutely ob 
scure which stand opposed as contradictory extremes 
for the same notion can at once be relatively or com 
paratively clear and relatively or comparatively ob 
scure absolutely obscure notions that is concepts 
whose objects can be distinguished from nothing else 
exist only in theory — an absolutely obscure notion 
being in fact no notion at all for it is of the very 
essence of a concept that its object should to a cer 
tain degree at least be comprehended in its peculiar 
consequently in its distinguishing characteristics 

but on the other hand of notions absolutely clear 
that is notions whose objects cannot possibly be con 
founded with aught else whether known or unknown 

— of such notions a limited intelligence is possessed 
of very few and consequently our human concepts 
are properly only a mixture of the opposite qualities

quality of clearness or obscurity considered in itself 

but a clear concept may be either distinct or indis 
tinct the distinctness and indistinctness of concepts 
are therefore to be considered apart from their clear 
ness and obscurity 

but before entering upon the nature of the distinc 
tion itself i may observe that we owe the discrimina 
tion of distinct and indistinct from clear and obscure 
notions to the acuteness of the great leibnitz by the 
cartesians the distinction had not been taken though 
the authors of the port royal logic come so near that 
we may well marvel how they failed explicitly to enounce 
itp though locke published his essay concerning 
human understanding some five years subsequent to 
the paper in winch leibnitz — then a very young 
man — had among other valuable observations pro 
mulgated this distinction locke did not advance be 
yond the limit already reached by the cartesians — 
indeed the praises that are so frequently lavished on 
this philosopher for his doctrine concerning the dis 
tinctions of ideas — the conditions of definition c 
— only prove that his encomiasts are ignorant of what 
had been done and in many respects far better done 
by descartes and his school — in fact with regard to 
the cartesian philosophy in general it must be con 
fessed that locke has many errors to expiate arising 
partly from oversight and partly from the most un 
accountable misapprehension of its doctrines it is

almost needless to say that those who in this country lect 

have written on this subject posterior to locke have i 

not advanced a step beyond him for though leib 
nitz be often mentioned and even occasionally quoted 
by our british philosophers i am aware of none who 
possessed a systematic acquaintance with his philo 
sophy and i might almost say who were even super 
ficially versed either in his own writings or in those of 
any of the illustrious thinkers of his school 

but to consider the distinction in itself — we have the un 
seen that a concept is clear when we are able to re 
cognise it as different from other concepts but we 
may discriminate a whole from other wholes we may 
discriminate a concept from other concepts though 
we have only a confused knowledge of the parts of 
which that whole or of the characters of which that 
concept is made up this may be illustrated by the iihutrmt 
analogy of our perceptive and representative faculties niy f 
we are all acquainted with many say a thousand ltrcp™ 
individuals that is we recognise such and such a t 
countenance as the countenance of john and as not 
the countenance of james thomas richard or any of 
the other this we do with a clear and certain 
knowledge but the countenances which we thus 
distinguish from each other are each of them a com 
plement made up of a great number of separate traits 
or features and it might at first view be supposed 
that as a whole is only the sum of its parts a clear 
cognition of a whole countenance can only be realised 
through a distinct knowledge of each of its constituent 
features but the slightest consideration will prove 
that this is not the case for how few of us are able 
to say of any the most familiar face what are the

particular traits which go to form the general result 
and yet on that account we hesitate neither in regard 
to our own knowledge of an individual nor in regard 
to the knowledge possessed by others — suppose a 
witness be adduced in a court of justice to prove the 
identity or nonidentity of a certain individual with 
the perpetrator of a certain crime the commission of 
which he had chanced to see — would the counsel be 
allowed to invalidate the credibility of the witness by 
first of all requiring him to specify the various ele 
ments of which the total likeness of the accused was 
compounded and then by showing that as the witness 
either could not specify the several traits or specified 
what did not agree with the features of the accused 
he was therefore incompetent to prove the identity 
or nonidentity required this would not be allowed 
for the court would hold that a man might have a 
clear perception and a clear representation of a face 
and figure of which however he had not separately 
considered and could not separately image to himself 
the constituent elements thus even the judicial de 
termination of life and death supposes as real the 
difference between a clear and a distinct knowledge 
for a distinct knowledge lies in the knowledge of the 
constituent parts while a clear knowledge is only of 
the constituted whole 

continuing our illustrations from the human coun

tions and representations is equally the case with lkct 
notions we may be able clearly to discriminate — 
one concept from another although the degree of con 
sciousness does not enable us distinctly to discrimin 
ate the various component characters of either con 
cept from each other the clearness and the distinct 
ness of a notion are thus not the same the former 
involves merely the power of distinguishing the total 
objects of our notions from each other the latter in 
volves the power of distinguishing the several charac 
ters the several attributes of which that object is the 
sum in the former the unity in the latter the mul 
tiplicity of the notion is called into relief 

the distinctness of a concept supposes however the special 
clearness and may therefore be regarded as a higher of the dl 
degree of the same quality or perfection “to the a concept 
distinctness of a notion over and above its general degrees 
clearness there are required three conditions — ° the 
clear apprehension of its several characters or compo 
nent parts ° the clear contrast or discrimination of 
these and ° the clear recognition of the nexus by 
which the several parts are bound up into a unity 
or whole 

“ as the clearness so the distinctness of a notion 
is susceptible of many degrees a concept may be 
called distinct when it involves the amount of con 
sciousness required to discriminate from each other its 
principal characters but it is so much the more dis 
tinct ° in proportion to the greater number of the

mined by the greater number of the clearly appre 
hended characters it depends still more on their su 
perior importance in particular it is of moment 
whether the characters be positive or negative inter 
nal or external permanent or transitory peculiar or 
common essential or accidental original or derived 
from the mere consideration of the differences sub 
sisting between attributes there emerge three rules to 
be attended to in bestowing on a concept its requisite 
distinctness in the first place we should endeavour 
to discover the positive characters of the object con 
ceived as it is our purpose to know what the object 
is and not what it is not when however as is not 
unfrequently the case it is not at once easy to discover 
what the positive attributes are our endeavour should 
be first directed to the detection of the negative and 
this not only because it is always an advance in know 
ledge when we ascertain what an object is not but 
likewise because the discovery of the negative cha 
racters conducts us frequently to a discovery of the 
positive 

“ in the second place among the positive qualities 
we should seek out the intrinsic and permanent before 
the extrinsic and transitory for the former give us 
a purer and more determinate knowledge of an ob 
ject though this object may likewise at the same time 
present many external relations and mutable modifi 
cations among the permanent attributes the pro 
per or peculiar always merit a preference if for no 
other reason because through them and not through 
the common qualities can the proper or peculiar nature 
of the object become known to us 

“ in the third place among the permanent charac 
ters we ought first to hunt out the necessary or essen

tial and then to descend from them to the contingent 
or accidental and this not only because we thus give 
order and connection to our notions but likewise be 
cause the contingent characters are frequently only to 
be comprehended through the necessary” a 

but before leaving this part of our subject it may 
be proper to illustrate the distinction of clear and 
distinct notions by one or two concrete examples of 
many things we have clear but not distinct notions 
thus we have a clear but not a distinct notion of col 
ours sounds tastes smells c for we are fully able 
to distinguish red from white to distinguish an acute 
from a grave note the voice of a friend from that of 
a stranger the scent of roses from that of onions the 
flavour of sugar from that of vinegar but by what 
plurality of separate and enunciable characters is this 
discrimination made it is because we are unable to 
do this that we cannot describe such perceptions and 
representations to others 

“if you ask of me” said st augustin “ what is time 
i know not if you do not ask me i know” p what 
does this mean simply that he had a clear but not 
a distinct notion of time 

of a triangle we have a clear notion when we 
distinguish a triangle from other figures without spe 
cially considering the characters which constitute it 
what it is but when we think it as a portion of 
space bounded by three lines as a figure whose three 
angles are equal to two right angles c then we 
obtain of it a distinct concept 

we now come to the consideration of the question — 
iiow does the distinctness of a concept stand affected

lect by the two quantities of a concept — and in reference 
x to this point i would in the first place dictate to you 
the following paragraph 

if xxix as a concept is a plurality of cha 
racters bound up into unity and as that plurality 
is contained partly in its intensive partly under 
its extensive quantity its distinctness is in like 
manner in relation to these quantities partly an 
internal or intensive partly an external or exten 
sive distinctness® 

explication in explanation of this it is to be observed that as 
the distinctness of a concept is contained in the clear 
apprehension of the various attributes of which it is 
the sum as it is the sum of these attributes in two 
opposite relations which constitute in fact two oppo 
site quantities or wholes and as these wholes are 
severally capable of illustration by analysis — it follows 
that each of these analyses will contribute its peculiar 
share to the general distinctness of the concept thus 
if the distinctness of a notion bears reference to that 
plurality which constitutes its comprehension in other 
words to that which is contained in the concept the 
distinctness is denominated an internal or intensive 
distinctness or distinctness of comprehension on the 
other hand if the distinctness refers to that plurality 
which constitutes the extension of the notion in other 
words to what is contained under it in that case the 
distinctness is called an external or extensive distinct 
ness a distinctness of extension it is only when a 
notion combines in it both of these species of distinct 
ness it is only when its parts have been analysed in

reference to the two quantities that it reaches the lkct 

highest degree of distinctness and of perfection — 

the internal distinctness of a notion is accomplished definition 
by exposition or definition that is by the enumeration zu 
of the characters or partial notions contained in it 
the external distinctness again of a notion is accom 
plished through division that is through the enu 
meration of the objects which are contained under 
it thus the concept man is rendered intensively 
more distinct when we declare that man is a rational 
animal it is rendered extensively more distinct when 
we declare that man is partly male partly female man 

in the former case we resolve the concept man into its 
several characters — into its partial or constituent attri 
butes in the latter we resolve it into its subordinate 
concepts or inferior genera in simple notions there simple no

concepts are the sum when we say that existence is 
either ideal or real that green is a yellowish or a

one to which we are always approximating but which 
we never are able actually to reach in order to ap

always inquire what is contained in and what under

imperfection of concepts 


it is now necessary to notice an imperfection to which lfct 
concepts are peculiarly liable and in the exposition of 


which i find it necessary to employ an expression sshf con 
which though it has the highest philosophical author ccpu ’ 
ity for its use i would still in consequence of its ambi 
guity in english have avoided if this could have been 
done without compromising the knowledge of what it 
is intended to express the expression i mean is in

used by leibnitz® and the continental philosophers in 
general — to denote what is common to our direct and 
ostensive cognition of individual objects in sense or 
imagination presentation or representation and in 
opposition to our indirect and symbolical cognition of 
general objects through the use of signs or language 
in the understanding but on this head i would 
first of all dictate to you the following paragraph 


•j xxx as a notion or concept is the fac par xxx

lect multiplicity and as this multiplicity is only 

— — mentally held together inasmuch as the concept 

is fixed and ratified in a sign or word it fre 
quently happens that in its employment the 
word does not suggest the whole amount of 
thought for which it is the adequate expression 
but on the contrary we frequently give and take 
the sign either with an obscure or indistinct con 
sciousness of its meaning or even without an 
actual consciousness of its signification at all 

uiuatnuion this liability to the vices of obscurity and indis 
tinctness arises ° from the very nature of a concept 
which is the binding up of a multiplicity in unity 
and ° from its dependence upon language as the 
necessary condition of its existence and stability in 
consequence of this when a notion is of a very com 
plex and heterogeneous composition we are frequently 
wont to use the term by which it is denoted without 
a clear or distinct consciousness of the various cha 
racters of which the notion is the sum and thus it is 
that we both give and take words without any or at 
least without the adequate complement of thought 
i may exemplify this — you are aware that in coun 
tries where banknotes have not superseded the use of 
the precious metals large payments are made in bags 
of money purporting to contain a certain number of a 
certain denomination of coin or at least a certain 
amount in value now these bags are often sealed 
up and passed from one person to another without 
the tedious process at each transference of counting 
out their contents and this upon the faith that if 
examined they will be found actually to contain the 
number of pieces for which they are marked and for 
which they pass current in this state of matters it 


 


lectures on logic 


 


is however evident that many errors or frauds may 
be committed and that a bag may be given and taken 
in payment for one sum which contains another or 
which in fact may not even contain any money at all 
now the case is similar in regard to notions as the 
sealed bag or rouleau testifies to the enumerated sum 
and gives unity to what would otherwise be an uncon 
nected multitude of pieces each only representing its 
separate value so the sign or word proves and ratifies 
the existence of a concept that is it vouches the tying 
up of a certain number of attributes or characters in 
a single concept — attributes which would otherwise 
exist to us only as a multitude of separate and uncon 
nected representations of value so far the analogy 
is manifest but it is only general the bag the 
guaranteed sum and the constituent coins represent 
in a still more proximate manner the term the con 
cept and the constituent characters for in regard 
to each we may do one of two things on the one 
hand we may test the bag that is open it and 
ascertain the accuracy of its stated value by counting 
out the pieces which it purports to contain or we 
may accept and pass the bag without such a critical 
enumeration in the other csse we may test the 
general term prove that it is valid for the amount 
and quality of thought of which it is the sign by 
spreading out in consciousness the various characters 
of which the concept professes to be the complement 
or we may take and give the term without such an 
evolution 

it is evident from this that notions or concepts are 
peculiarly liable to great vagueness and ambiguity 
and that their symbols are liable to be passed about

will agree with me that we do not annex distinct and lect 
complete ideas to every term we make use of and — — — 
that in talking of government church negotiation 
conquest we seldom spread out in our minds all the 
simple ideas of which these complex ones are composed 

it is however observable that notwithstanding this 
imperfection we may avoid talking nonsense on these 
subjects and may perceive any repugnance among 
the ideas as well as if we had a full comprehension of 
them thus if instead of saying that in war the 
weaker have always recourse to negotiation we should 
say that they have always recourse to conquest the 
custom which we have acquired of attributing certain 
relations to ideas still follows the words and makes 
us immediately perceive the absurdity of that pro 
position 

“ in the remarks which dr campbell has made on 
this passage he has endeavoured to explain in what 
manner our habits of thinking and speaking gradually 
establish in the mind such relations among the words 
we employ as enable us to carry on processes of 
reasoning by means of them without attending in 
every instance to their particular signification with 
most of his remarks on this subject i perfectly agree 
but the illustrations he gives of them are of too great 
extent to be introduced here and i would not wish 
to ran the risk of impairing their perspicuity by 
attempting to abridge them i must therefore refer 
such of my readers as wish to prosecute the specula 
tion to his very ingenious and philosophical treatise 

“ ‘ in consequence of these circumstances says dr ani camp 
campbell ‘ it happens that in matters which are per 
fectly familiar to us we are able to reason by means 
of words without examining in every instance their

signification almost all the possible applications of 
the terms in other words all the acquired relations 
of the signs have become customary to us the con 
sequence is that an unusual application of any 
term is instantly detected this detection breeds 
doubt and this doubt occasions an immediate recourse 
to ideas the recourse of the mind when in any 
degree puzzled with the signs to the knowledge it has 
of the things signified is natural and on such subjects 
perfectly easy and of this recourse the discovery of 
the meaning or of the unmeaningness of what is said 
is the immediate effect but in matters that are by 
no means familiar or are treated in an uncommon 
manner and in such as are of an abstruse and intricate 
nature the case is widely different the instances in 
which we are chiefly liable to be imposed on by words 
without meaning are according to dr campbell the 
three following — 

u first when there is an exuberance of metaphor 

“ secondly when the terms most frequently occur 
ring denote things which are of a complicated nature 
and to which the mind is not sufficiently familiarised 
such are the words — government church state con 
stitution polity power commerce legislature juris 
diction proportion symmetry elegance 

“ thirdly when the terms employed are very 
abstract and consequently of very extensive signifi 
cation 

“ the more general any word is in its signification 
it is the more liable to be abused by an improper or 
unmeaning application a very general term is appli 
cable alike to a multitude of different individuals a 
particular term is applicable but to a few when the 
rightful applications of a word are extremely numer

ous they cannot all be so strongly fixed by habit but lect 
that for greater security we must perpetually recur — li — 
in our minds from the sign to the notion we have of 
the thing signified and for the reason aforementioned 
it is in such instances difficult precisely to ascertain 
this notion thus the latitude of a word though 
different from its ambiguity hath often a similar 
effect’ ” ° 

now on this i would in the first place observe wuo an 
that the credit attributed to ilume by dr campbell hume in 
and mr stewart as having been the first by whom the employ 
the observation had been made is even in relation to tem with 
british philosophers not correct hume has stated meaning 
nothing which had not with equal emphasis and an 
equal development been previously stated by locke 
in four different places of his essay a 

thus to take only one out of at least four passages 
directly to the same effect and out of many in which 
the same is evidently maintained he says in the 
chapter entitled — of the abuse of words — “ others locke 
there be who extend this abuse yet farther who take 
so little care to lay by words which in their primary 
notation have scarce any clear and distinct ideas 
which they are annexed to that by an unpardonable 
negligence they familiarly use words which the pro 
priety of language has affixed to very important 
ideas without any distinct meaning at all wisdom 

glory grace c are words frequent enough in every 
man’s mouth but if a great many of those who use 
them should be asked what they mean by them they 
would be at a stand and not know what to answer

a plain proof that though they have learned those 
sounds and have them ready at their tongue’s end 
yet there are no determined ideas laid up in their 
minds which are to be expressed to others by them 
men having been accustomed from their cradles to 
learn words which are easily got and retained before 
they knew or had framed the complex ideas to which 
they were annexed or which were to be found in the 
things they were thought to stand for they usually 
continue to do so all their lives and without taking 
the pains necessary to settle in their minds determined 
ideas they use their words for such unsteady and 
confused notions as they have contenting themselves 
with the same words other people use as if their 
very sound necessarily carried with it constantly the 
same meaning this though men make a shift with 
in the ordinary occurrences of life where they find it 
necessary to be understood and therefore they make 
signs till they are so yet this insignificancy in their 
words when they come to reason concerning either 
their tenets or interest manifestly fills their discourse 
with abundance of empty unintelligible noise and jar 
gon especially in moral matters where the words for 
the most part standing for arbitrary and numerous col 
lections of ideas not regularly and permanently united 
in nature their bare sounds are often only thought 
on or at least very obscure and uncertain notions 
annexed to them men take the words they find in 
use among their neighbours and that they may not 
seem ignorant what they stand for use them confi 
dently without much troubling their heads about a 
certain fixed meaning whereby besides the ease of it 
they obtain this advantage that as in such discourses

mistakes who have no settled notions as to dis

be or no ” a 

from a comparison of this passage with those 
which i have given you from stewart campbell and 
hume it is manifest that among british philosophers 

locke is entitled to the whole honour of the observa 
tion for it could easily be shown even from the iden 
tity of expression that hume must have borrowed it 
from locke and of humes doctrine the two other 
philosophers profess only to be expositors 

this curious and important observation was not the distinc 
however first made by any british philosopher for tuitivo and 
leibnitz had not only anticipated locke in a pub knowledge 
lication prior to the essay but afforded the most pre by leibnitz 
cise and universal explanation of the phenomenon 
which has yet been given 

to him we owe the memorable distinction of our tins ditinc

distinction is involved the explanation of the pheeno vofno

distinction likewise which has superseded in germany 
the whole controversy of nominalism and concep 
tualism — which in consequence of the nonestablish

of our philosophical language has idly agitated the

lect considerations it is also evident that of the things 

i — which we distinctly know we are not conscious of the 

ideas except in so far as we employ an intuitive cog 
nition and indeed it happens that we often falsely 
believe that we have in our mind the ideas of things 
erroneously supposing that certain terms which we 
employ had been applied and explicated and it is 
not true at least it is ambiguously expressed what 
some assert — that we cannot speak concerning any 
thing understanding what we say without having 
an idea of it actually present for we frequently 
apply any kind of meaning to the several words or we 
merely recollect us that we have formerly understood 
them but because we are content with this blind 
thinking and do not follow out the resolution of the 
notions it happens that contradictions are allowed to 
lie hid which perchance the composite notion involves” 

 “ thus at first sight it must seem that we 
 could form an idea of a maximum velocity motus 
celerrimi for in using the terms we understand what 
we say we shall find however that it is impossible 
for the notion of a quickest motion is shown to be con 
tradictory and therefore inconceivable let us sup 
pose that a wheel is turned with a velocity absolutely 
at its maximum every one perceives that if one of 
its spokes be produced its outer end will be moved 
more rapidly than the nails in the circumference of 
the wheel the motion therefore of these is not a 
maximum which is contrary to the hypothesis and 
therefore involves a contradiction”

the term symbolical knowledge to designate the lect 

former and the term intuitive knowledge to compre — 

hend the two latter — terms which have ever since 
become classical in his owm country — has bestowed 
on the german language of philosophy in this re 
spect a power and precision to which that of no other 
nation can lay claim in consequence of this while 
the philosophers of this country have been all along 
painfully expounding the phenomenon as one of the 
most recondite arcana of psychology in germany it 
has for a century and a half subsided into one of the 
elementary doctrines of the science of mind it was 
in consequence of the establishment of this distinction 
by leibnitz that a peculiar expression begriff con 
ceptus was appropriated to the symbolical notions of 
the understanding in contrast to the intuitive pre 
sentations of sense and representations of imagination 
which last also were furnished with the distinctive 
appellations of intuitions anschauungcn intuitus 

thus it is that by a more copious and wellappointed 
language philosophy has in germany been raised above 
various controversies which merely in consequence 
of the poverty and vagueness of its english nomen 
clature have idly occupied our speculations but to 
return to the mere logical question 

the doctrine of leibnitz in regard to this natural tiw dutiuc 
imperfection of our concepts was not overlooked by his cjatcd 
disciples and i shall read to you a passage from the of leibnitz 
lesser logic of wolf — a work above a century old and 
which was respectably translated from german into 
english in the year this translation is now 
rarely to be met with which may account for its being 
apparently totally unknown to our british philosophers 
and yet upon the whole with all its faults and imper

fections it is perhaps the most valuable work on logic 
to say nothing of the port royal logic in the 
english language 

“ by words we usually make known our thoughts 
to others and thus they are nothing but uttered 
articulate signs of our thoughts for the information 
of others for example if one asks me what i am 
thinking of and i answer the sun by this word i 
acquaint him what object my thoughts are then em 
ployed about 

“ if two persons therefore are talking together it 
is requisite in order to be understood first that he 
who speaks shall join some notion or meaning to each 
word secondly that he who hears shall join the 
very same notion that the speaker does 

“ consequently a certain notion or meaning must 
be connected with and therefore something be signi 
fied by each word 

“now in order to know whether we understand 
what we speak or that our words are not mere empty 
sound we ought at every word we utter to ask our 
selves what notion or meaning we join therewith 

“ for it is carefully to be observed that we have 
not always the notion of the thing present to us or in 
view when we speak or think of it but are satisfied 
when we imagine we sufficiently understand what we 
speak if we think we recollect that we have had at 
another time the notion which is to be joined to this 
or the other word and thus we represent to ourselves 
as at a distance only or obscurely the thing denoted 
by the term § c i 

“ hence it usually happens that when we combine 
words together to each of which apart a meaning or 


 


lectures on logic 


 


notion answers we imagine we understand what we lect 

utter though that which is denoted by such combined — 

words be impossible and consequently can have no deniood”” 
meaning for that which is impossible is nothing at 
all and of nothing there can be no idea for instance 
we have a notion of gold as also of iron but it is 
impossible that iron can at the same time be gold 
consequently neither can we have any notion of iron 
gold and yet we understand what people mean when 
they mention irongold 

“ in the instance alleged it certainly strikes every further 
one at first that the expression irongold is an empty iro ci 
sound but yet there are a thousand instances in 
which it does not so easily strike for example when 
i say a rectilineal twolined figure contained under 
two rightlines i am equally well understood as when 
i say a rightlined triangle a figure contained under 
three rightlines and it should seem we had a dis 
tinct notion of both figures § c i however as 
we show in geometry that two rightlines can never 
contain a space it is also impossible to form a notion 
of a rectilineal twolined figure and consequently 
that expression is an empty sound just so it holds 
with the vegetable soul of plants supposed to be a 
spiritual being whereby plants are enabled to vege 
tate or grow for though those words taken apart 
are intelligible yet in their combination they have 
no manner of meaning just so if i say that the 
attractive spirit or attractive cord as linus calls 
it or the attractive force as some philosophers at 
this day is an immaterial principle superadded to 
matter whereby the attractions in nature are per 
formed no notion or meaning can possibly be joined

lfct divides a genus into its species is called in that 

 — respect specification genera and species are 

both called classes and the arrangement of 
things under them is therefore denominated 
classification 

explication it is manifest that the distinction into genera and 

the distiuc i • 

tion of genus species is a merely relative distinction as the same 
merx notion is in one respect a genus in another respect 
a species for except a notion has no higher notion 
that is except it be itself the widest or most universal 
notion it may always be regarded as subordinated to 
another and in so far as it is actually thus regarded 
it is a species again every notion except that which 
has under it only individuals is in so far as it is thus 
viewed a genus for example the notion triangle if 
viewed in relation to the notion of rectilineal figure 
is a species as is likewise rectilineal figure itself as 
viewed in relation to figure simply again the con 
cept triangle is a genus when viewed in reference to 
the concepts — rightangled triangle acuteangled 
triangle c a rightangled triangle is however 
only a species and not possibly a genus if under it be 
necessarily included individuals alone but in point 
of fact it is impossible to reach in theory any lowest 
species for we can always conceive some difference 
by which any concept may be divided ad infinitum 
this however as it is only a speculative curiosity 
like the infinitesimal divisibility of matter may be 
thrown out of view in relation to practice and 
therefore the definition by porphyry and logicians in 
general of the lowest species of which i am imme 
diately to speak is practically correct even though

it cannot be vindicated against theoretical objections lfct 
on the other hand we soon and easily reach the — lj — 
highest genus which is given in to ov ens oliquid 
being thing something c which are only various 
expressions of the same absolute universality out of 
these conditions there arise certain denominations of 
concepts which it is likewise necessary that you be 
made aware of 

in regard to the terms generification and specified generifica 
tion these are limited expressions for the processes of spocifica 
abstraction and determination considered in a par what 
ticular relation abstraction and determination you 
will recollect we have already spoken of in general a 
it will therefore be only necessaiy to say a very few 
words in reference to them as the several operations 
by which out of species we evolve genera and out of 
genera we evolve species and first in regard to 
abstraction and generification in every complex gcnerifica 
notion we can limit our attention to its constituent 
characters to the exclusion of some one we thus 
think away from this one — we abstract from it now 
the concept which remains that is the fasciculus of 
thought minus the one character which we have 


thrown out is in relation to the original — the entire 
concept the next higher — the proximately superior 
notion but a concept and a next higher concept 
are to each other as species and genus the process of 
abstraction therefore by which out of a proximately 
lower we evolve a proximately higher concept is 
when we speak with logical precision called the pro 
cess of generification 

take for example the concept man this concept 
is proximately composed of the two concepts or con

lect stituent characters — animal and rational being if 

 — we think either of these characters away from the 

other we shall have in that other a proximately higher 
concept to which the concept man stands in the 
relation of a species to its genus if we abstract 
from animal then man will stand as a species in 
subordination to the genus rational being and the 
concept animal will then afford only a difference to 
distinguish man as a coordinate species from immate 
rial intelligences if on the other hand we abstract 
from rational being then man will stand as a species 
in subordination to the genus animal having for a 
coordinate species irrational animal such is the 
process of gencrification now for the converse pro 
cess of specification 

specific every series of concepts which has been obtained 
by abstraction may be reproduced in an inverted 
order when descending from the highest notion we 
step by step add on the several characters from which 
we had abstracted in our ascent this process as 
you remember is called determination — a very ap 
propriate expression inasmuch as by each character 
or attribute which we add on we limit or determine 
more and more the abstract vagueness or extension of 
the notion until at last if every attribute be annexed 
the sum of attributes contained in the notion becomes 
convertible with the sum of attributes of which some 
concrete individual or reality is the complement 
now when we determine any notion by adding on a 
subordinate concept we divide it for the extension 
of the higher concepts is precisely equal to the exten 
sion of the added concept lus its negation thus if 
to the concept animal we add on the next lower con 
cept rational we divide its extension into tw r o halves

— the one equal to rational animal — the other equal lect 
to its negation that is to irrational animal thus xl 
an added concept and its negation always constitute 
the immediately lower notion into which a higher 
notion is divided but as a notion stands to the 
notions proximately subordinate to it in the imme 
diate relation of a genus to its species the proceas of 
determination by which a concept is thus divided 
is in logical language appropriately denominated 
specification 

so much in general for the subordination of no 
tions considered as genera and species there are 
however various gradations of this relation and cer 
tain terms by which these are denoted which it is 
requisite that you should learn and lay up in memory 

the most important of these are comprehended in the 
following paragraph —

species etsos vi tawrjxov species subalterna 
media and is defined “that which being a 
species may also become a genus” thus a sub 
altern genus and a subaltern species are con

explication the distinctions and definitions in this paragraph 
are taken from the celebrated introduction of por 
phyry to the categories of aristotle and they have 
been generally adopted by logicians it is evident 
that the only absolute distinction here established is 
that between the highest or supreme genus and the 
lowest species for the other classes to wit the sub 
altern or intermediate are all and each either genera 
or species according as we regard them in an ascend 
ing or a descending order the same concept being a 
genus if considered as a whole containing under it 
inferior concepts as parts and a species if considered 
as itself the part of a higher concept or whole the 
distinction of concepts into genus and species into 
supreme and intermediate genus into lowest and 
intermediate species is all that logic takes into 
account because these are all the distinctions of 
degree that are given necessarily in the form of 
thought and as abstracted from all determinate 
matter

to show that in other respects they are imperfect it 
is manifest that the supreme genus or category being 
is not immediately divided into these ten classes and 
that they neither constitute coordinate nor distinct

as absolute or as relative as absolute it flow r s either 
from the matter or from the form of things if from 
the matter — it is quantity aristotle’s second category 
if from the form it is quality aristotle’s third cate 
gory as relative it corresponds to aristotle’s fourth 
category relation and to relation all the other six 
may be reduced for the categoiy where is the rela 
tion of a thing to other tilings in space the category 
when is the relation of a thing to other things in 
time action and passion constitute a single relation 
— the relation of the agent and the patient posture 
is the relation of the parts of a body to each other 
finally habit is the relation of a thing containing and 
a thing contained® the little i have now said in re

than i was strictly warranted to say considering them

so far as metaphysical is opposed to logical is 
inept for we shall see that both these wholes 
and parts are equally logical and that logicians 
have been at fault in considering one of them 
in their doctrine of reasoning to the exclusion 
of the other 

a whole is that which contains parts a part is 
that which is contained in a whole but as the rela 
tion of a whole aud parts is a relation dependent on 
the point of view from which the mind contemplates 
the objects of its knowledge and as there are differ 
ent points of view in which these may be considered 
it follows that there may also be different wholes and 
parts philosophers have accordingly made various 
enumerations of wholes and without perplexing 
you with any minute discussion of their various divi 
sions it may be proper in order to make you the 
better aware of the two wholes with which logic is 
conversant — and that there are two logical wholes 
and consequently two grand forms of reasoning aud 
not one alone as all logicians have hitherto taught i 
shall hereafter endeavour to convince you — to this 
end i say it may be expedient to give you a general 
view of the various wholes into which the human 
mind may group up the objects of its speculation 

wholes may be first divided into two genera — into

man a whole per accidens is that which the 
parts make up contingently as when man is consi

per se may again be subdivided into five kinds into 
a logical a metaphysical a physical a mathematical 
and a collective ° a logical styled also a uniw holo xt 
versal a subject or subjective a potential whole into r

logical whole is the genus the logical parts the species 
and individual in the metaphysical e contra an in 
dividual is the whole of which the species a species 
the whole of which the genera are the parts a 
metaphysical whole is thus manifestly the whole de 
termined by the comprehension of a concept as a 
logical whole is that whole determined by its exten 
sion and if it can be shown that the whole of com 
prehension affords the conditions of a process of rea 
soning equally valid equally useful equally easy and 
to say the least of it equally natural as that afforded 
by the whole of extension it must be allowed that it 
is equally well entitled to the name of a logical whole 
as the whole which has hitherto exclusively obtained 
that denomination ° a physical or as it is like ° physi

in the paragraph last dictated of these none seem 
to require any exposition save the words subjective

the former of these — the term subjective or more 
properly subject as applied to the species as parts sub 
jacent to or lying under a genus — to the individuals 
as parts subjacent to or lying under a species is a 
clear and appropriate expression but as applied to 
the genus or species considered as wholes the term 
subject is manifestly improper and the term subjective 
hardly defensible in like manner the term universal 
as applied to genus or species considered as logical 
wholes is correct but as applied to individuals con 
sidered as logical parts it is used in opposition to its 
proper meaning the desire however to obtain 
epithets common both to the parts and to the whole 
and thus to indicate at once the relation in general 
has caused logicians to violate the proprieties both of 
language and of thought but as the terms have

been long established i think it sufficient to put you lect 
on your guard by this observation — — 


in regard to the term potential — i shall before tho term 
saying anything read to you a passage from the cni mon 
antient metaphysics of the learned lord monboddo “quoted 

“ in the first place it is impossible by the nature of 
things that the genus should contain the species as a 
part of it and the species should likewise contain the 
genus in the same respect but in different respects 
it is possible that each of them may contain the other 
and be contained by it we must therefore try to 
distinguish the different manners of containing and 
being contained and there is a distinction that runs 
through the whole of ancient philosophy solving many 
difficulties that are otherwise insurmountable and 
which i hope will likewise solve this difficulty the 
distinction i mean is the distinction betwixt what 
exists swapely or potentially only and that which ex 
ists ivepye ta or actually in the first sense every 
thing exists in its causes and in the other sense 
nothing exists but what is actually produced now 
in this first sense the whole species exists in the 
genus for the genus virtually contains the whole 
species not only what actually exists of it but what 
may exist of it in any future time in the same 
manner the lowest species below which there is no 
thing but individuals contains virtually all those indi 
viduals present and future thus the species man 
comprehends all the individuals now existing or 
that shall hereafter exist which therefore are said 
to be parts of the species man on the other 
hand the genus is actually contained in the species

lect and the species likewise in each of the individuals 
— under it thus the genus animal is actually con 
tained in the species man without which it could 
not be conceived to exist and for the same reason 
the species man is actually contained in each indivi 
dual it is a piece of justice which i think i owe to 
an author hardly known at all in the western parts of 
europe to acknowledge that i got the hint of the so 
lution of this difficulty from him the author i mean 
is a living greek author eugenius diaconus at present 
professor as i am informed in the patriarch’s univer 
sity at constantinople who has written an excellent 
system of logic in very good attic greek” 
stcwort this or rather a similar passage at p of the fourth 

this jaraic volume of the antient metaphysics affords mr stewart 

considered 

an opportunity ol making sundry unfavourable stric 
tures on the technical language of logic in regard 
to which he asserts “ the adepts are not to this 
day unanimously agreed ” and adds that “ it is an 
extraordinary circumstance that a discovery on which 
in lord monboddo’s opinion the whole truth of the 
syllogism depends should be of so very recent a date” 
now this is another example which may serve to 
put you on your guard against any confidence in the 
assertions and arguments even of learned men you 
may be surprised to hear that so far is eugenius from 
being the author of this observation and of the term 
potential as applied to a logical whole that both are 
to be found with few exceptions in all the older sys 
tems of logic to quote only one but one of the 
best and best known that of burgersdyck — he says

notices this difference of the two wholes p 

having thus terminated the consideration of con 
cepts as reciprocally related in the perpendicular line 
of subordination and in the quantity of extension 
in so far a they are viewed as containing classes — i 
must before proceeding to consider them under this 
quantity in the horizontal line of coordination state 
to you two terms by which characters or concepts are 
denominated in so far as they are viewed as differ

which it stands is called the individual or

lect apart in two different species individually or nume

one and the same reality thus animal and stone 
may be said to be generically different horse and ox 
to be specifically different highflyer and eclipse to 
generic be numerically or individually different it is evi 
iffewnco c dent however that as all genera and species except 
the highest of the one and the lowest of the other 
may be styled indifferently either genera or species 
generic difference and specific difference are in gen 
eral only various expressions of the same thing and 
accordingly the terms heterogeneous and homogene 
ous which apply properly only to the correlation of 
genera are usually applied equally to the correlation 
of species 

individual “ individual existences can only be perfectly discri 
diffcrenc© ar m inated in perception external or internal and their 
numerical differences are endless for of all possible 
contradictory attributes the one or the other must 
on the principles of contradiction and excluded 
middle be considered as belonging to each individual 
thing on the other hand species and genera may be 
perfectly discriminated by one or few characters for 
example man is distinguished from eveiy genus or 
species of animal by the one character of rationality 
triangle from every other class of mathematical 
figures by the single character of trilaterality it is 
therefore far easier adequately to describe a genus or 
species than an individual existence as in the latter 
case we must select out of the infinite multitude of 
characters which an individual comprises a few of 
the most prominent or those by which the thing may 
most easily be recognised” ° but as those which we

thus select are only a few and are only selected with lect 
reference to our faculty of apprehension and our capa 
city of memory they always constitute only a petty 
and often not the most essential part of the numeri 
cal differences by which the individuality of the ob 
ject is determined 

having now terminated the consideration of the 
subordination of concepts under extension it is only 
necessary to observe that their coordination under 
that quantity affords nothing which requires explana 
tion except what is contained in the following para 
graph — 


if xxxix notions in so far as they are par xxxix 
considered the coordinate species of the same tionofcun 
genus may be called consjiecics and in so far as cqt ’ 
conspecies are considered to be different but not 
contradictory they are properly called discrete or 
disjunct notions notiones discretes vel disjunctcs 

the term disparate notiones disparates is fre 
quently applied to this opposition of notions 
but less properly for this ought to be reserved to 
denote the corresponding opposition of notions in 
the quantity of comprehension 


i conclude the consideration of concepts as depend 
ent on extension by a statement of the two general 
laws by which both subordination and coordination of 
notions under this quantity are regulated 


tf xl the whole classification of things by par xl 
genera and species is governed by two laws the general law 
one of these the law of homogeneity principium suborina 
honiogeneitatis is — that how different soever ton mil

may be any two concepts they both still stand 
subordinated under some higher concept in other 
words things the most dissimilar must in certain 
respects be similar the other the law of hetero 
geneity principium heterogeneitatis is — that 
every concept contains other concepts under it 
and therefore when divided proximately we de 
scend always to other concepts but never to in 
dividuals in other words things the most homo 
geneous — similar — must in certain respects be 
heterogeneous — dissimilar 

’ these two laws the former as the principle which 
 generific enables and in fact compels us to rise from species to 
spwtfica genus is that which determines the process of generi 
fication and the latter as the principle which enables 
and in fact compels us to find always species under a 
genus is that which regulates the process of specifica 
law of tion the second of these laws it is evident is only 
ieitytme true ideally only true in theory the infinite divisi 
thwry bility of concepts like the infinite divisibility of space 
and time exists only in speculation and that it is 
theoretically valid will be manifest if we take two 
similar concepts that is two concepts with a small 
difference let us then clearly represent to ourselves 
this difference and we shall find that how small soever 
it may be we can always conceive it still less without 
being nothing that is we can divide it ad infinitum 
but as each of these infinitesimally diverging differ 
ences affords always the condition of new species it is 
evident that we can never end that is reach the indi

there is another law which kant promulgates in 
the critique of pure reason a and which may be called 
the law of logical affinity or the law of logical con 
tinuity it is this — that no two coordinate species 
touch so closely on each other but that we can con 
ceive other or others intermediate thus man and 
orangoutang elephant and rhinoceros are proximate 
species but still how great is the difference between 
them and how many species can we not imagine to 
ourselves as possibly interjacent 

this law i have however thrown out of account 
as not universally true for it breaks down when 
we apply it to mathematical classifications thus all 
angles are either acute or right or obtuse for be 
tween these three coordinate species or genera no 
others can possibly be interjected though we may 
always subdivide each of these in various manners 
into a multitude of lower species this law is also 
not true when the coordinate species are distin 
guished by contradictory attributes there can in 
these be no interjacent species on the principle of 
excluded middle for example — in the cuvierian 
classification the genus animal is divided into the 
two species of vertebrata and invertebrata that is 
into animals with a backlrone — with a spinal mar 
row and animals without a backbone — without a 
spinal marrow is it possible to conceive the pos 
sibility of any intermediate class p

identical they necessarily have no differences by which 
they can be distinguished but what are indiscernible 
can be known neither as two concepts nor as two 
identical concepts because we are ex hypothesis unable 
to discriminate the one from the other they are 
therefore to us as one notions absolutely identical 
can only be admitted if abstracting our view alto 
gether from the concepts we denominate those notions 
identical which have reference to one and the same 
object and which are conceived either by different 
minds or by the same mind but at different times 

their difference is therefore one not intrinsic and

in this sense absolutely identical notions will be only

therefore properly called that of contradiction or of 
repugnance and the opposing notions themselves 
are contradictory or repugnant notions in a single 
word contradictories the latter or contrary oppo 
sition is exemplified in the opposites yellow blue 
red c walking standing lying c” 

“ in the case of contradictory opposition there are 
only two conflictive attributes conceivable and of 
these one or other must be predicated of the object 
thought in the case of contrary opposition on the 
other hand more than two conflictive characters are 
possible and it is not therefore necessary that if 
one of these be not predicated of an object any one 
other must thus though i cannot at once sit and 
stand and consequently sitting and standing are attri 
butes each severally incompatible with the other 
yet i may exist neither sitting nor standing — i may 
lie but i must either sit or not sit i must either 
stand or not stand c such in general are the 
oppositions of contradiction and contrariety”

but at the same time in so far as two concepts afford 
the elements and if brought into relation necessitate 
the formation of an affirmative or negative proposi 
tion they may be considered as in themselves negative 
and affirmative ” 

“ further it is evident that a notion can only be 
logically denied by a contradiction for when we 
abstract from the matter of a notion as logic does 
it is impossible to know that one concept excludes 
another unless the one be supposed the negation of 
the other logically considered all positive or affir 
mative notions are congruent that is they can as 
far as their form is concerned be all conceived or 
thought together but whether in reality they can co 
exist — that cannot be decided by logical rules if 
therefore we would with logical precision and cer 
tainty oppose things we must oppose them not as 
contraries a b c but as contradictories a — not 
a b — not b c — not c — hence it also follows 
that there is no negation conceivable without the con 
comitant conception of an affirmation for we cannot 
deny a thing to exist without having a notion of the 
existence which is denied ” a 

there are also certain other relations subsisting be 
tween notions compared together in reference to their 
comprehension 

 xliii notions as compared with each other 
in respect of their comprehension are further 
distinguished into intrinsic and extrinsic the

so much for the mutual relations of notions in re 
ference to their comprehension when considered not 
in the relations of involution and coordination 

having thus given you the distinctions of notions 
as founded on their more general relations under the 
quantity of comprehension i now proceed to con 
sider them under this quantity in their proximate 
relations that is in the relation of involution and 
the relation of coordination these relations have 
been i may say altogether neglected by logicians 
and in consequence of this they have necessarily over 
looked one of the two great divisions of all reasoning 
for all our reasoning is either from the whole to the 
parts and from the parts to the whole in the quantity 
of extension or from the whole to the parts and from 
the parts to the whole in the quantity of comprehen 
sion in each quantity there is a deductive and in 
each quantity there is an inductive inference and if 
the reasoning under either of these two quantities 
were to be omitted it ought perhaps to have been 
the one which the logicians have exclusively cultivated

for the quantity of extension is a creation of the 
mind itself and only created through as abstracted 
from the quantity of comprehension whereas the 
quantity of comprehension is at once given in the 
very nature of things the former quantity is thus 
secondary and factitious the latter primary and na 
tural 

that logicians should have neglected the process of 
reasoning which is competent between the parts and 
whole of the quantity of comprehension is the more 
remarkable as after aristotle they have in general 
articulately distinguished the two quantities from 
each other and after aristotle many of them have 
explicitly enounced the special law on which the logic 
of comprehension proceeds this principle established 
but not applied is expressed in the axiom — the cha 
racter of the character is the character of the thing 
or the predicate of the predicate is the predicate of 
the subject nota notce eat nota rei ipsius prcedi 
catum preedicati est pradicatum subjecti this 
axiom is enounced by aristotle and its application 
i have little doubt was fully understood by him in 
fact i think it even possible to show in detail that 
his whole analysis of the syllogism has reference to 
both quantities and that the great abstruseness of his 
prior analytics the treatise in which he develops 
the general forms of reasoning arises from this — that 
he has endeavoured to rise to formulae sufficiently 
general to express at once what was common to both 
kinds — an attempt so far beyond the intelligence of 
subsequent logicians that they have wholly misun 
derstood and perverted his doctrine they under 
stood this doctrine only as applied to the reasoning 


o catty c iii — e d

in extensive quantity and in relation to this kind of 
reasoning they have certainly made palpable and easy 
what in aristotle is abstract and difficult but then 
they did not observe that aristotle’s doctrine applies 
to two species of which they only consider one it 
was certainly proper to bring down the aristotelic 
logic from its high abstraction and to deliver its 
rules in proximate application to each of the two 
several species of reasoning this would have been 
to fill up the picture of which the stagirite had given 
the sketch but by viewing the analytic as exclu 
sively relative to the reasoning in extension though 
they simplified the onehalf of syllogistic they alto 
gether abolished the other this mistake — this par 
tial conception of the science — is common to all 
logicians ancient and modern for in so far as i am 
aware no one has observed that of the quantities of 
comprehension and extension each affords a reason 
ing proper to itself and no one has noticed that the 
doctrine of aristotle has reference indifferently to 
both although some i know having perceived in 
general that we do reason under the quantity of com 
prehension have on that founded an objection to all 
reasoning under the quantity of extension that is to 
the whole science of logic as at present constituted 
i have in some degree at present spoken of matters 
which properly find their development in the sequel 
and i have made this anticipation in order that you 
should attend particularly to the relation of concepts 
under the quantity of comprehension as containing 
and contained inasmuch as this affords the founda 
tion of one and that not the least important of 
the two great branches into which all reasoning is 
divided

par xliv 
involution

nation 


h xliv we have seen that of the two quan 
tities of notions each affords a logical whole and 
parts and that by opposite errors the one of 
these has through over inclusion been called the 
logical whilst the other has through over exclu 
sion been called the metaphysical thus in 
respect of their comprehension no less than of 
their extension notions stand to each other in a 
relation of containing and contained and this 
relation which in the one quantity extension 
is styled that of subordination may in the other 
comprehension for distinction’s sake be styled 
that of involution coordination is a term which 
may be applied in either quantity 

in the quantity of comprehension one notion 
is involved in another when it forms a part of 
the sum total of characters which together con 
stitute the comprehension of that other and 
two notions are in this quantity coordinated 
when whilst neither comprehends the other both 
are immediately comprehended in the same lower 
concept 


expiica from what has been formerly stated you are aware 
that the quantity of comprehension belonging to a 
notion is the complement of characters which it con 
tains in it and that this quantity is at its maximum 
in an individual thus the notion of the individual 
socratcsy contains in it besides a multitude of others 
the characters of son of sophroniscus athenian greek 
european man f animal organised being c but 
these notions these characters are not all equally 
proximate and immediate some are only given in 

a cf drobisch loyilc §§ fischer loylk § 


lectures on logic 


 


and through others tlius the character athenian 
is applicable to socrates only in and through that of 
son of sophroniscus — the character of greek only in 
and through that of athenian — the character of euro 
pean only in and through that of greek — and so forth 
in other words socrates is an athenian only as the 
son of sophroniscus only a greek as an athenian 
only a european as a greek only a man as a euro 
pean only an animal as a man only an organised 
being as an animal those characters therefore that 
are given in and through others stand to these others 
in the relation of parts to wholes and it is only on 
the principle — part of the part is a part of the 
whole — that the remoter parts are the parts of the 
primary whole thus if we know that the individual 
socrates comprehends the character son of sophron 
iscus and that the character son of sophroniscus 
comprehends the character athenian we are then 
warranted in saying that socrates comprehends athe 
nian in other words that socrates is an athenian 
the example here taken is too simple to show in what 
manner our notions are originally evolved out of the 
more complex into the more simple and that the pro 
gress of science is nothing more than a progressive 
unfolding into distinct consciousness of the various 
elements comprehended in the characters originally 
known to us in their vague or confused totality 

it is a famous question among philosophers — 
whether our knowledge commences with the gen 
eral or with the individual — whether children first 
employ common or first employ proper names in 
this controversy the reasoners have severally proved 
the opposite opinion to be untenable but the question 
is at once solved by showing that a third opinion

lect is the true — viz that our knowledge commences 

— with the confused and complex which as regarded 

in one point of view or in another may easily be 
mistaken either for the individual or for the general 
the discussion of this problem belongs however to 
psychology not to logic® it is sufficient to say in 
general that all objects are presented to us in com 
plexity that we are at first more struck with the 
points of resemblance than with the points of con 
trast that the earliest notions and consequently 
the earliest terms are those that correspond to this 
synthesis while the notions and the terms arising from 
an analysis of this synthesis into its parts are of a 
subsequent formation but though it be foreign to 
the province of logic to develop the history of this 
procedure yet as this procedure is natural to the 
human mind logic must contain the form by which 
it is regulated it must not only enable us to reason 
from the simple and general to the complex and in 
dividual it must likewise enable us to reverse the 
process and to reason from the complex and in 
dividual to the simple and the general and this it 
does by that relation of notions as containing and 
contained given in the quantity of comprehension 
in comprc the nature of this reasoning can indeed only be

thus the characters oviparous and warmblooded

are not warmblooded and warmblooded animals 
which are not oviparous again it is true i believe 
that all warmblooded animals have hearts with four 
cavities two auricles and two ventricles and that 
all animals with such hearts breathe by lungs and 
not by gills but then in this case we have no 
right to suppose that the first of these characters 
comprehends the second and that the second compre 
hends the third for we should be equally entitled 
to assert that all animals breathing by lungs pos 
sessed hearts of four cavities and that all animals 
with such hearts are warmblooded they are thus 
thought as mutually the conditions of each other 
and whilst we may not know their reciprocal depend 
ence they are however conceived by us as on an 
equal footing of coordination this at least is true 
of the two attributes heart with four cavities and

attributes electrical and polar as a single notion un 
less we convert the one of these attributes into a sub

if we do — if we say what is electrical is polar we at 
once reduce the duality to unity — we judge that polar 
is one of the constituent characters of the notion 
electrical or that what is dectncal is contained under 
the class of things marked out by the common charac

two subjects iron and mineral as a single notion 
unless we convert the one of these subjects into an 
attribute by which the other is determined or quali

again reduce the duality to unity we judge that one

a judgment from what has now been said it is evident that a 
uin three judgment must contain and express three notions 
which however as mutually relative constitute an 
indivisible act of thought it must contain ° the 
notion of something to be determined ° the notion 
of something by which another is determined and 
° a notion of the relation of determination between 
the two this will prepare you to understand the 
following paragraph

we think as the determined or qualified notion is 
technically called the subject vnokeipevov sub

or qualifying notion the predicate karrjyopovpe

and the predicate is called the copula by 
aristotle the predicate includes the copula a and

constitute a part of the other either in the 
quantity of extension or in the quantity of 
comprehension 

thus in the proposition iron is magnetic we have illustration 
iron for the subject magnetic for the predicate and 
the substantive verb is for the copula in regard to 
this hist it is necessary to say a few words “ it is 
not always the case that in propositions the copula is 
expressed by the substantive verb is or est and that 
the copula and predicate stand as distinct words in 
adjective verbs the copula and predicate coalesce as 
in the proposition the sun shines sol lucet which is 
equivalent to the sun is shining sol est lucens in ex 
istential propositions that is those in which mere 
existence is predicated the same holds good for 
when i say i am ego sum the am or sum has here a 
far higher and more emphatic import than that of the 
mere copula or link of connection for it expresses 

i am existing ego sum existens it might seem 
that in negative propositions when the copula is 
affected by the negative particle it is converted into 
a noncopula but if we take the word copula in a 
wider meaning for that through which the subject 
and predicate are connected in a mutual relation it 
will apply not only to affirmative but to negative not

only to categorical but to hypothetical and disjunc 
tive propositions” a i may notice that propositions 
with the subject predicate and copula all three arti 
culately expressed have been called by the school 
men those of the third adjacent proposiiiones tertii 
adjacentis or tertii adjecti f inasmuch as they mani 
festly contain three parts this is a barbarous ex 
pression for what the greeks after aristotle called

“ what has now been said will enable you to per 
ceive how far concepts and judgments coincide and 
how far they differ on the one hand they coincide 
in the following respects — in the first place the 
concept and the judgment are both products the 
one the product of a remote the other the product of 
an immediate act of comparison in the second place 
in both an object is determined by a character or 
attribute finally in the third place in both things 
relatively different in existence are reduced to a rela 
tive identity in the unity of thought on the other 
hand they differ in the following respects — in the 
first place the determination of an object by an attri 
bute is far more express in the judgment than in the 
concept for in the one it is developed in the other 
only implied in the second place in the concept the 
unity of thought is founded only on a similarity of 
quality in the judgment on the other hand it is 
founded on a similarity of relation for in the

notion an object and its characters can only be con leot 
ceived as one inasmuch as they are congruent and — — 
not conflictive for thus only can they be united into 
one total concept but in the judgment as a subject 
and predicate are not necessarily thought under a 
similarity of quality the judgment can comprehend 
not only congruent but likewise conflictive and even 
contradictory notions for two concepts which are 
compared together can be recognised as standing in 
the relation either of congruence or of repugnance 

such is the sameness and such is the diversity of 
concept and judgment”® 

we have thus seen that a judgment or proposition 
consists of three parts or correlative notions — the 
notion of a subject the notion of a predicate and the 
notion of the mutual relation of these as determined 
and determining 

judgments may i think be primarily divided in j adgments 
two ways — the divisions being determined by the divided 
general dependencies in which their component parts 
stand to each other — and the classes afforded by these 
divisions when again considered without distinction 
in the different points of view given by quantity 
quality and relation will exhaust all the possible 
forms in which judgments are manifested 


h xlviii the first great distinction of judg par xinii 
ments is taken from the relation of subject and sion of 
predicate as reciprocally whole and part if the — compre

this distinction of propositions is founded on the 
distinction of the two quantities of concepts — their 
comprehension and their extension the relation of 
subject and predicate is contained within that of 
whole and part for we can always view either the 
determining or the determined notion as the whole 


which contains the other the whole however which 
the subject constitutes and the whole which the pre 
dicate constitutes are different — being severally de 
termined by the opposite quantities of comprehension 
and of extension and as subject and predicate neces 
sarily stand to each other in the relation of these 
inverse quantities it is manifestly a matter of indiffer 
ence in so far as the meaning is concerned whether 
we view the subject as the whole of comprehension 
which contains the predicate or the predicate as the 
whole of extension which contains the subject in 
point of fact in single propositions it is rarely appar 
ent which of the two wholes is meant for the copula 
is est c equally denotes the one form of the relation 
as the other thus in the proposition man is two 
legged — the copula here is convertible with compre 
hends or contains in it for the proposition means 
man contains in it twolegged that is the subject 
man as an intensive whole or complex notion com 
prehends as a part the predicate twolegged again 
in the proposition man is a biped the copula corre

tantamount to man is contained under biped — that 
is the predicate biped as an extensive whole or class

point of fact neither of the two propositions unam lfct 
biguously shows whether it is to be viewed as of an — i 
intensive or of an extensive purport nor in a single 
proposition is this of any moment all that can be 
said is that the one form of expression is better 
accommodated to express the one kind of proposition 
the other better accommodated to express the other 

it is only when propositions are connected into syllo 
gism that it becomes evident whether the subject or 
the predicate be the whole in or under which the 
other is contained and it is only as thus constituting 
two different — two contrasted forms of reasoning — 
forms the most general as under each of these every 
other is included — that the distinction becomes neces 
sary in regard to concepts and propositions the dis 
tinction of propositions into extensive and intensive 
it is needless to say is therefore likewise the most 
general and accordingly it is only in subordination 
to this distinction that the other distinctions of which 
we are about to treat are valid 

i now proceed to the second division of judgments 
and commence with the following paragraph 


f xlix the second division of judgments 
is founded on the different mode in which the 
relation of determination may subsist between 
the subject and predicate of a proposition this 
relation is either simple ox conditioned propositio

i shall consider these in their order and first of 
categorical propositions but here it is proper be 
fore proceeding to expound what is designated by the 
term categorical to commence with an explanation of 
the term itself this word as far as is now known 
was first employed by aristotle in a logical signifi 
cation i have already explained the meaning of 
the term category but you are not to suppose that 
categorical has any reference to the ten summa 
genera of the stagirite by aristotle the term xarq 
yopiko is frequently employed more especially in the 
books of the prior analytics — and in these books 
alone it occurs if i am correct in my estimate eighty 
seven times now you will observe that in no single 
instance is this word applied by aristotle except in 
one unambiguous signification that is the signification 
of affirmative and it is thus by him used as a term 
convertible with taraattcos and as opposed to the two 
synonyms of negation he indifferently employs — airo 
£mcos and crreptjtikos such is the meaning of the 
word in aristotelic usage now you will observe that 
it obtained a totally different meaning in the writings 
of his disciples this new meaning it probably ob 
tained from theophrastus the immediate disciple of 
aristotle for by him and eudemus we know that it

was so employed — and in this new meaning it was ifct 

exclusively applied by all the greek and latin expo — 

sitors of the peripatetic philosophy in fact by all 
subsequent logicians without exception in this 
second signification the term categorical as applied 
to a proposition denotes a judgment in which the 
predicate is simply affirmed or denied of the subject 
and in contradistinction to those propositions which 
have been called hypothetical and disjunctive in this 
change of signification there is nothing very remark 
able but it is a singular circumstance that though thi 
the aristotelic employment of the word be in every uiflcatiou 
instance altogether clear and unambiguous no one wrvir 
either in ancient or in modern times should ever have 
made the observation that the word was used in two 
different meanings and that in the one meaning it 
was used exclusively by aristotle and in the other 
exclusively by all other logicians i find indeed that 
the greek commentators on the organon do in refer 
ence to particular passages sometimes state that karrj 
¦yopiko is there used by aristotle in the signification 
of affirmative but in so far as i have been able to 
ascertain no one has made the general observation 
that the word was never applied by aristotle in the 
sense in which alone it was understood by all other 
logical writers so much for the meaning of the 
term categorical as now employed for simple or 
absolute and as opposed to conditional it is used 
in a sense different from its original and aristotelic

judgment implies to the exclusion of all extrinsic 
conditions it is evident that what we have already 
said of the essential nature of judgment in general 
affords all that can be said of categorical judgments 
in particular a categorical proposition is expressed 
in the following formulae a is b or a is not b i 
proceed therefore to the genus of propositions as 
opposed to categorical — viz the conditional — condi 
tioned this genus as stated in the paragraph com 
prises two species according as the condition lies 
more proximately in the subject or in the predicate 
to which is to be added either as a third species or 
as a compound of these two those propositions in 
which there is a twofold condition — the one belonging 
to the subject the other to the predicate the first 
of these as stated forms the class hypothetical the 
second that of disjunctive the third that of dilem 
matic propositions i may notice by the way that 
there is a good deal of variation in the language of 
logicians in regard to the terms conditional and 
hypothetical you are aware that condit ionalis in 
latin is commonly applied as a translation of vnode 
tlkos in greek and by boethius who was the first 
among the latins who elaborated the logical doctrine 
of hypothetical the two terms are used convertibly 
with each other® by many of the schoolmen how 
ever the term hypothetical hypotheticus was used to 
denote the genus and the term conditional to denote 
the species and from them this nomenclature has 
passed into many of the more modern compends of 
logic — and among others into those of aldrich and 
whately this latter usage is wrong if either

term is to be used in subordination to the other con lect 

ditional as the more extensive term ought to be 

applied to designate the genus and so it has accord 
ingly been employed by the best logicians but to 
pass from words to things 

i said that hypothetical propositions are those in i iiypo 
which the condition qualifying the relation between 
the subject and predicate lies proximately in the 
subject in the proposition b is a the subject b is 
unconditionally thought to exist and it thus consti 
tutes a categorical proposition but if we think the 
subject b existing only conditionally and under this 
conditional existence enunciate the judgment we 
shall have the hypothetical proposition — if b is a is 

— or in a concrete example — rainy weather is wet 
weather is a categorical proposition — if it rains it 
will be wet is an hypothetical in an hypothetical 
proposition the objects thought stand in such a mutual 
relation that the one can only be thought in so far 
as the other is thought in other words if we think 
the one we must necessarily think the other they 
thus stand in the relation of reason and consequent 

for a reason is that which being affirmed necessarily 
entails the affirmation of something else a conse 
quent is that which is only affirmed inasmuch as some 
thing previous is affirmed the relation between rea 
son and consequent is necessary for a reason fol 
lowed by nothing would not be the reason of any 
thing and a consequent which did not proceed from 
a reason would not be the consequent of anything 

an hypothetical proposition must therefore contain 
a reason and its consequent and it thus presents the 
appearance of two members or clauses the first 
clause — that which contains the reason — is called the

“ this consequence if is — then is is the copula in

ness but a single act of thought consequently in it 
lies that synthesis that connection which constitutes 
the hypothetical judgment although therefore an 
hypothetical judgment appear double and may be cut 
into two different judgments it is nevertheless not a 
composite judgment for it is realised through a 
simple act of thought in which if and then the ante 
cedent and the consequent are thought at once and as 
inseparable the proposition if b is then a it is 
tantamount to the proposition a is through b but 
this is as simple an act as if we categorically judged 
b is a that is b is under a of these two 
neither the one — if the sun shines nor the other 
— then it is day — if thought apart from the other 
will constitute a judgment but only the two in con

in which the subject is at a minimum of ex

which the subject is not articulately or overtly 
declared to be either universal particular or

° the doctrine i prefer this division ap 
pears to me untenable and i divide proposi

ing manner — in this respect their differences 
arise either a as in judgments from the 
necessary condition of the internal thought 
or b as in propositions merely from the 
accidental circumstances of its external expres 
sion 

under the former head a judgments are 
either a of determinate or definite quantity 
according as their sphere is circumscribed or b 
of quantity indeterminate or indefinite accord 
ing as their sphere is uncircumscribed — again

judgments of a determinate quantity a are 
either of a whole undivided in which case 
they constitute a universal or general propo 
sition or of a unit indivisible in which 
case they constitute an individual or singular 
proposition — a judgment of an indeterminate 
quantity b constitutes a particular propo 
sition 

under the latter head b propositions have 
either as propositions their quantity determi 
nate or indeterminate marked out by a verbal 
sign or they have not such quantity being 
involved in every actual thought they may be 
called in the one case a predesignate in the 
other b preindesignate 

again the common doctrine remounting also 
to aristotle takes into view only the subject 
and regulates the quantity of the proposition 
exclusively by the quantity of that term the 
predicate indeed aristotle and the logicians 
do not allow to be affected by quantity at 
least they hold it to be always particular in 
an affirmative and universal in a negative 
proposition 

this doctrine i hold to be the result of an in 
complete analysis and i hope to show you that 
the confusion and multiplicity of which our pre 
sent logic is the complement is mainly the con 
sequence of an attempt at synthesis before the 
ultimate elements had been fairly reached by a 
searching analysis and of a neglect in this 
instance of the fundamental postulate of the

lect particular judgments are those in which among 
 xh the objects within a certain sphere or class we judge 
j udements concerning some indefinite number less than the whole 
— as some men are virtuous — many boys are courage 
ous — most women are compassionate the indefinite 
plurality within the totality being here denoted by 
words the words some many most there are certain words 
tormirout which serve to mark out the quantity in the case 
of universal individual and particular propositions 
andps the words which designate universality are all the 
politic whole of every both each none no one neither always 
everywhere etc the words which mark out particu 
larity are some not all one two three etc sometimes 
somewhere etc there are also terms which though 
they do not reach to an universal whole approximate 
to it as many most almost all the greatest part etc 
few very few hardly any etc which in the common 
employment of language and in reference to merely 
probable matter may be viewed as almost tantamount 
to marks of universality 

distinction by logicians in general it is stated that in a logical 
andindi relation an individual is convertible with an universal 
partial proposition as in both something is predicated of a 
judgments w p e subject and neither admits of any exception 
but a particular judgment likewise predicates some 
thing of a whole subject and admits of no exception 
for it embraces all that is viewed as the subject and 
excludes all that is viewed as not belonging to it 
the whole distinction consists in this — that in uni 
versal and in individual judgments the number of 
the objects judged of is thought by us as definite 
whereas in particular judgments the number of such 
objects is thought by us as indefinite that indi vi 


and individuttm vagina so partial the former of each and the latter of 
lare signatnm and particularc vagum each corresponding — memoranda

dual judgments do not correspond to universal judg lect 
ments merely in virtue of the oneness of their subject i — l 
is shown by this — that if the individual be rendered 
indefinite the judgment at once assumes the character 
of particularity for example the propositions — a 
gennan invented the art of printing — an englishman 
generalised the la w of gravitation — are to be viewed as 
particular propositions but if we substitute for the 
indefinite expressions a german and an englishman 
the definite expressions fust and newton the judg 
ment obtains the form of an universal 

with regard to quantity it is to be observed say categorical

so defined that the disjunct attributes are predicated

and consequently that the judgment is particular or 
indefinite for example as an hypothetical — if 
some men are learned then others are unlearned as 
a disjunctive — those men who are learned are either 
philosophers or not but it is easily seen that these

the first judgment the real consequent is — then all 
others are unlearned and in the second the true 
subject is — all learned men for this is involved in 
the expression — those men who are learned etc” a

such is the doctrine of the logicians this i cannot 
but hold to be erroneous for we can easily construct 
propositions whether hypothetical or disjunctive which 
cannot be construed either as universal or singular 
for example when we say hypothetically — if some 
dodo is then some animal is or disjunctively — 
some men are either rogues or fools — in either case 
the proposition is indefinite or particular and no inge 
nuity can show a plausible reason wdiy it should be 
viewed as definite — as general or individual

judgments — their quality opposition and conversion 


the first part of our last lecture was occupied with 
the doctrine of judgments considered as divided into 
simple and into conditional simple being exclusively 
categorical conditional either hypothetical disjunc 
tive or hypotheticodisjunctive we then proceeded 
to treat of the quantity of propositions and in this 
respect i stated that they are either definite or inde 
finite the definite comprising the two subordinate 
classes of general or universal and of singular or 
individual propositions while the indefinite are cor 
respondent to particular propositions alone in regard 
to the terms definite and indefinite i warned you that 
i do not apply them in the sense given by logical wri 
ters with them indefinite propositions denote those 
in which the quantity is not explicitly declared by one 
of the designatory terms all every some many etc 
such propositions however ought to be called pre 
indesignate jprceindesignatce airpoohiopicrtol that 
is not marked out by a prefix — a term better adapted 
to indicate this external accident of their enunciation

judgments

for in point of fact these preindesignate propositions 
are either definite or indefinite and quite as definite 
or indefinite in meaning as if their quantity had been 
expressly marked out by the predesignatory terms 

this being premised i now go on to the next divi 
sion of judgments — the division proceeding on that 
ground which by logicians has been called the qua 
lity of judgments in itself the term quality is here 
a very vague and arbitrary expression for we might 
with equal propriety give the name of quality to 
several other of the distinguishing principles of pro 
positions for example the truth or falsehood of pro 
positions has been also called their quality and some 
logicians have even given the name of quality to the 
ground of the distinction of judgments into categorical 
hypothetical and disjunctive what however has 
been universally if not always exclusively styled the 
quality of propositions both in ancient and modern 
times is that according to which they are distributed 
into affirmative and negative 


if li in respect of their quality judgments 
are divided into two classes for either the 
subject and predicate may be recognised as reci 
procally containing and contained in the opposite 
quantities of extension and comprehension or 
they may be recognised as not standing in this 
relation in the former case the subject and 
predicate are affirmed of each other and the 
proposition is called an affirmative nporaaiq

in this paragraph i have enounced more generally lect 
than is done by logicians the relation of predication — 


unions 


in its affirmative and negative phases for their defi wrant 
nitions only apply either to the subject or to the predi nition of 
cate taken as a whole whereas since we may indiffer ltheparo 
ently view either the subject as the whole in relation graph 
to the predicate or the predicate as the whole in rela 
tion to the subject according as we consider the pro 
position to express an intensive or to express an exten 
sive judgment — it is proper in our definition whether 
of predication in general or of affirmation and negation 
in particular to couch it in such terms that it may 
indifferently comprehend both these classes — both 
these phases of propositions 

as examples of affirmative and negative proposi affirmative 
tions the following may suffice — a is b — a is not b tivc proj 
— god is merciful — god is not vindictive in an 
affirmative judgment there is a complete inclusion 
of the subject within the predicate as an extensive 
whole or of the predicate within the subject as 
an intensive whole in negative judgments on the 
contrary there is a total exclusion of the subject 
from the sphere of the predicate extensively or of 
the predicate from the comprehension of the subject 
intensively in affirmative propositions there is also 
distinctly enounced through what predicate the notion 
of the subject is to be thought that is what predicate 
must be annexed to the notion of the subject in 
negative propositions in like manner it is distinctly 
enounced through what predicate the notion of the 
subject is not to be thought that is what predicate 
must be shut out from the notion of the subject in 
negative judgments therefore the negation essentially 
belongs to the copula for otherwise all propositions 
without distinction would be affirmative this how

the oppo

maintained 
by the 
author 


true import 
of the logi 
cal copula 


ever has been a point of controversy among modern 
logicians for many maintain that the negation belongs 
to the predicate on the following grounds — if the 
negation pertained to the copula there could be no 
synthesis of the two terms — the whole act of judg 
ment would be subverted — while at the same time a 
nonconnecting copula a noncopulative is a contradic 
tion in terms but a negative predicate that is a pre 
dicate by which something is taken away or excluded 
from the subject involves nothing contradictory and 
therefore a judgment with such a predicate is compe 
tent 

the opposite doctrine is however undoubtedly the 
more correct for if we place the negation in the pre 
dicate negative judgments as already said are not 
different in form from affirmative being merely affirm 
ations that the object is contained within the sphere 
of a negative predicate or that a negative predicate 
forms one of the attributes of the subject this how 
ever the advocates of the opinion in question do not 
venture to assert the objection from the apparent 
contradiction of a nonconnecting copula is valid only 
if the literal the grammatical meaning of the term 
copula be coextensive with that which it is applied 
logically to express but this is not the case if liter 
ally taken it indicates only one side of its logical 
meaning what the word copula very inadequately 
denotes is the form of the relation between the subject 
and predicate of a judgment now in negative judg 
ments this form essentially consists in the act of tak 
ing a part out of a whole and is as necessary an act

of thought as the putting it in the notion of the lect 
one contradictory in fact involves the notion of the 
other® 

the controversy took its origin in this — that every originoftho 
negative judgment can be expressed m an affirmative regarding 
form when the negation is taken from the copula negation 
and placed in the predicate thus a is not b may be 
changed into — a is not the contrast is better 
expressed in latin a non est b — a est non b in 
fact we are compelled in english to borrow the latin 
non to make the difference unambiguously apparent 
saying a is non b instead of a is not b but this 
proves nothing for by this transposition of the 
negation from the copula to the predicate we are 
also enabled to express every affirmative proposition 
through a double negation thus a is b in the affir 
mative form is equivalently enounced by a is not non 
b — a non est non b in the negative 

this possibility of enunciating negative propositions negative 
in an affirmative and affirmative propositions in a how deig 
negative form has been the occasion of much perverse aristot l 
refinement among logicians aristotle denominated 
the negative terms such as non b non homo non 
albus c ovoiara aopterra literally indefinite nouns 
boethius however unhappily translated aristotle’s n v 
greek term dopiaros by the latin infinitus reserving boctuu 
the term indefinitus to render dstdptcrro as applied to 
propositions but of which the notion is more ap 
propriately expressed as we have seen by the word 
indcsignate indesignatus or better preindesignate 
prceindesignatus the schoolmen following boethi by the 
us thus called the ovopara aoplcrra of aristotle no clloolmen

irifinitans out of such elements they also constructed 
propositiones infinite that is judgments in which 
either the subject or the predicate was a negative 
notion as nonhomo est viridis and homo est non 
viridis and these they distinguished from the simple 
negative homo — non est — viridis herein boethius 

and the schoolmen have been followed by kant a 
through the wolfian logicians for he explains infi 
nite judgments as those which do not simply indicate 
that a subject is not contained under the sphere of 
a predicate but that it lies out of its sphere some 
where in the infinite sphere he has thus considered 
them as combining an act of negation and an act of 
affirmation inasmuch as one thing is affirmed in them 
through the negation of another in consequence of 
this view he gave them after some wolfians the 
name of limitative which he constituted as a third 
form of judgments under quality — all propositions 
being thus either affirmative negative or limitative 
the whole question touching the validity of the dis 
tinction is of no practical consequence and consists 
merely in whether a greater or less latitude is to be 
given to certain terms i shall not therefore occupy 
your attention by entering on any discussion of what 
may be urged in refutation or defence but if what 
i have already stated of the nature of negation and 
its connection with the copula be correct there is no 
ground for regarding limitative propositions as a 
class distinct in form and coordinate with affirma 
tive and negative judgments £

should stand prominently out by itself can establish 
no difference in which to originate a distinction of the 
kind of the examples adduced — the pure proposi

alexander being the subject was the copula and the

the modal — alexander conquered darius honourably 
and resolve it in like manner we shall have alexander 
was the honourable conqueror of darius and here the 
whole difference is that in the second the predicate is 
a little more complex being the honourable conqueror 
of darius instead of the conqueror of darius 

but logicians after aristotle have principally con division of

many passages to the same effect in whately speaking 
of the quality of propositions he says — “ when the

it may be proper however to explain to you the 
meaning of three terms which are used in relation to 
pure and modal propositions a proposition is called 
assertory when it enounces what is known as actual 
problematic when it enounces what is known as pos 
sible apodeictic or demonstrative when it enounces 
what is known as necessary® 

the last point of view in whicli judgments are con 
sidered is their relation to each other in respect of 
these relations propositions have obtained from logi 
cians particular names which however cannot be un 
derstood without at the same time regarding the mat 
ter which the judgments contain as the distinctions 
of judgments and of concepts are in this respect in 
a great measure analogous both in name and nature 
it will not be necessary to dictate them 

when the matter and form of two judgments are 
considered as the same they are called identical con 
vertible equal or equivalent propositiones identicce 
pares convert ibiles cequipollentes on the opposite 
alternative they are called different pr diversce if 
considered in certain respects the same in others dif 
ferent they are called relatively identical similar 
or cognate pr relative identicce similes affines cog 
nates this resemblance may be either in the subject 
and comprehension or in the predicate and extension 
if they have a similar subject their predicates are 
disparate dispa rata if a similar predicate their 
subjects are disjunct disjuncta 

when two judgments differ merely in their quan 
tity of extension and the one is therefore a parti 
cular the other a general they are said to be subor 
dinated and their relation is called subordination

 subordinatio the subordinating or as it might lect 

perhaps be more properly styled the superordinate 

judgment is called the subaltemant subaltemans i lur 
the subordinate judgment is called the subodtemate 
subaltemat urn 

when of two or more judgments the one affirms opjnmition 
the other denies and when they are thus reciprocally menu 
different in quality they are said to be opposed or 
confiictive pr apposite e avriktipevai and their re 
lation in this respect is called opposition oppositio 

this opposition is either that of contradiction or ewndic

if neither contradiction nor contrariety exists the consent 
judgments are called congruent pr congruentes con

there is an opposition of what are called subcontraries

men are not learned and they are called subcontra

men are learned no man is learned but this is a not ri 
mistake there is no opposition between subcontraries opp lt u 
for both may at once be maintained as both at once 
must be true if the some be a negation of all they 
cannot however both be false the opposition in

iii — the doctrine of reasonings 

reasoning in general syllogisms — their 

divisions according to internal form 

in my last lecture i terminated the doctrine of 
judgments and now proceed to that of reasonings 

“when the necessity of the junction or separation of 
a certain subjectnotion and a certain predicateno 
tion is not manifest from the nature of these notions 
themselves but when at the same time we are desir 
ous of knowing whether they must be thought as 
inclusive or as exclusive of each other — in this case 
we find ourselves in a state of doubt or indecision 
from our ignorance of which of the two contradictory 
predicates must be affirmed or denied of the subject 
but this doubt can be dissipated — this ignorance can 
be removed only in one way — only by producing in 
us a necessity to connect with or disconnect from the 
subject one of the repugnant predicates and since 
ex hypothesi this necessity does not at least does 
not immediately arise from the simple knowledge 
of the subject in itself or of the predicate in it 
self or of both together in themselves it follows

that it must be derived from some external source lkct 

and derived it can only be if derived from some other — 

knowledge which affords us as its necessary conse 
quence the removal of the doubt originally harboured 

but if this knowledge has for its necessary conse 
quence the removal of the original doubt this know 
ledge must stand to the existing doubt in the relation 
of a general rule and as every rule is a judgment it 
will constitute a general proposition but a general 
rule does not simply and of itself reach to the re 
moval of doubt and indecision there is required 
and necessarily required over and above this further 
knowledge — that the rule has really an application 
or what is the same thing that the doubt really 
stands under the general proposition as a case which 
can be decided by it as by a general rule but when 
the general rule has been discovered and when its 
application to the doubt has likewise been recognised 
the solution of the doubt immediately follows and 
therewith the determination of which of the contradic 
tory predicates must or must not be affirmed of the 
subject and this determination is accompanied with 
a consciousness of necessity or absolute certainty” ° a iihntnted 
simple example will place the matter in a clearer light 

when the notion of the subject man is given along 
with the contradictory predicates free agent and ne 
cessary agent there arises the doubt — with which of 
these contradictory predicates the subject is to be con 
nected for as contradictory they cannot both be 
affirmed of the subject and as contradictory the one 
or the other must be so affirmed in other words i 
doubt whether man be a free agent or not the no

necessary agent do not in themselves afford a solu 
tion of the doubt and i must endeavour to discover 
some other notion which will enable me to decide 
now taking the predicate free agent this leads me 
to the closely connected notion morally responsible 
agent which let it be supposed that i otherwise know 
to be necessarily a free agent i thus obtain the pro 
position — every morally responsible agent is a free 
agent but this proposition does not of itself contain 
the solution of the doubt for it may still be asked does 
the notion morally responsible agent constitute a pre 
dicate which appertains to the notion of man the sub 
ject this question is satisfied if it is recognised 
that the notion man involves in it the notion of a 
morally responsible agent i can then say — man is a 
morally responsible agent these two propositions 
being thus formed and applied to the subsisting 
doubt the removal of this doubt follows of itself and 
in place of the previous indecision whether man be a 
free agent or not there follows with the conscious 
ness of necessity or absolute certainty the connected 
judgment that man is also a free agent the whole 
process — the whole series of judgments — will stand 
thus — 

every morally responsible ayent is a free agent 

man is a morally responsible agent 

therefore man is a free agent 

let us consider in what relation the different consti 
tuent parts of this process stand to each other it is 
evident that the whole process consists of three no 
tions and their mutual relations the three notions 
are free agent responsible agent and man their 
mutual relations are all those of whole and part

sion for the notion free agent is seen to contain 
under it the notion responsible agent and the notion 
responsible agent to contain under it the notion man 
thus these three notions are like three circles of three 
various extensions severally contained one within 
another and it is evident that the process by which 
we recognise that the narrowest notion man is con 
tained under the widest notion responsible agent is 
precisely the same by which we should recognise the 
inmost circle to be contained in the outmost if we 
were only supposed to know the relation of these to 
gether by their relation to the middle 
circle let abc denote the three 
circles now ex hypothesis we know 
and only know that a contains b and 
that b contains c but as it is a self 
evident principle that a part of the part is a part of the 
whole we cannot with our knowledge that b contains 
c and is contained in a avoid recognising that c is 
contained in a this is precisely the case with the 
three notions — free agents — responsible agent y — man 
not knowing the relation between the notions free agent 
and man y but knowing that free agent contained under 
it responsible agents and that responsible agent contain 
ed under it man y we upon the principle that the part 
of a part is a part of the whole are compelled to think 
as a necessary consequence that free agent contains 
under it man it is thus evident that the process 
shown in the example adduced is a mere recognition 
of the relation of three notions in the quantity of ex 
tension our knowledge of the relation of two of these 
notions to each other being not given immediately 
but obtained through our knowledge of their relation 
to the third

but let us consider this process a little closer the 
relations of the three notions in the above example 
ing b ofex are those given in the quantity of breadtli or exten 
btexhik on but every notion has not only an extensive 
hension— but likewise an intensive quantity — not only a 
s£tl iu quantity in breadth but a quantity in depth and 
these two quantities stand to each other as we have 
seen always in a determinate ratio — the ratio of inver 
sion it would therefore appear a priori to be a 
necessary presumption that if notions bear a certain 
relation to each other in the one quantity they must 
bear a counter relation to each other in the other 
quantity consequently that if we are able under the 
quantity of extension to deduce from the relations of 
two notions to a third their relation to each other a 
correspondent evolution must be competent of the 
same notions in the quantity of comprehension let 
us try whether this theoretical presumption be war 
ranted a posteriori and by experiment and whether 
in the example given the process can be inverted and 
the same result obtained with the same necessity 
that example as in extension was — 


all resjxmsible aye nix arc free agent 
but man is a responsible agent 
therefore man is a free agent 


in other words — the notion responsible agent is con 
tained under the notion free agent but the notion 
man is contained under the notion responsible agent 
therefore on the principle that the part of a part is a 
part of the whole the notion man is also contained 
under the notion free agent now on the general 
doctrine of the relation of the two quantities we must

if we would obtain the same result in the compre 
hensive which is here obtained under the extensive 
quantity invert the whole process that is the notions 
which in extension are wholes become in comprehen 
sion parts and the notions which in the former are 
parts become in the latter wholes thus the notion 
free agent which in the example given was the great 
est whole becomes in the counter process the smallest 
part and the notion man which was the smallest part 
now becomes the greatest whole the notion respon 
sible agent remains the middle quantity or notion in 
both but its relation to the two other notions is re 
versed what was formerly its part being now its 
whole what was formerly its whole being now its 
part the process will therefore be thus explicitly 
enounced — 

the notion man comprehend s in it the notion responsible agent 

but the notion responsible agent comprehends in it the notion free 
agent 

i therefore on the principle that the part of a part is a part of 
the whole the notion man also comprehends in it the notion 
free agent 

or in common language — 

man is a responsible agent 

but’ a responsible agent is a free agent 

therefore man is a free agent 

this reversed process in the quantity of comprehen 
sion gives it is evident the same result as it gave in 
the quantity of extension for on the supposition 
that we did not immediately know that the notion 
man comprehended free agent but recognised that 
man comprehended responsible agent f and that re 
sponsible agent comprehended free agent we neces 
sarily are compelled to think in the event of this

a few words in explanation of these will suffice explication

in regard to the act of reasoning nothing can be the act 
more erroneous than the ordinary distinction of this fng caon 
process as the operation of a faculty different in kind 
from those of judgment and conception concep 
tion judgment and reasoning are in reality only 
various applications of the same simple faculty that 
of comparison or judgment i have endeavoured to 
show that concepts are merely the results ren 
dered permanent by language of a previous process 
of comparison that judgment is nothing but com 
parison or the results of comparison in its immediate 
or simpler form and finally that reasoning is 
nothing but comparison in its mediate or more 
complex application® it is therefore altogether a mwon 
erroneous to maintain as is commonly done that a organic

lfct syllogism can be separated into three parts or pro 

— positions and that these propositions have a certain 

meaning when considered apart and out of relation 
to each other but when thus considered they lose 
the whole significance which they had when united 
in a reasoning for their whole significance consisted 
in their reciprocal relation — in the light which they 
mutually reflected on each other we can certainly 
hew down an animal body into parts and consider its 
members apart but these though not absolutely void 
of all meaning when viewed singly and out of relation 
to their whole have lost the principal and peculiar 
significance which they possessed as the coefficients 
of a one organic and indivisible whole it is the same 
with a syllogism the parts which in their organic 
union possessed life and importance when separated 
from each other remain only enunciations of vague 
generalities or of futile identities though when 
expressed in language it be necessary to analyse a 
reasoning into parts and to state these parts one after 
another it is not to be supposed that in thought one 
notion one proposition is known before or after 
another for in consciousness the three notions and 
their reciprocal relations constitute only one identical 
and simultaneous cognition 

error of the logicians have indeed all treated the syllogism 
tiirtrou” as if this w r ere not the case they have considered 
syllogism one proposition as naturally the last in expression 
and this they have accordingly called the conclusion 
whilst the other two as naturally going before the 
conclusion they have styled the premises forming 
together what they call the antecedent the two 
premises they have also considered as the one the 
greater major the other the less minor by exclu

sive reference to the one quantity of extension all 
this however is in my view completely erroneous 
for we may in the theory of logic as we actually 
do in its practical applications indifferently enounce 
what is called the conclusion first or last in the 
latter case the conclusion forms a thesis and the 
premises its grounds or reasons and instead of the 
inferential therefore ergo apa we would employ 
the explicative for the whole difference consists 
in this — that the common order is synthetic the other 
analytic and as to express the thought we must 
analyse it the analytic order of statement appears 
certainly the most direct and natural on the sub 
ordinate matter of the order of the premises i do not 
here touch 

but to speak of the process in general — without 
the power of reasoning we should have been limited in 
our knowledge if knowledge of such a limitation 
would deserve the name of knowledge at all — say 
without reasoning we should have been limited to a 
knowledge of what is given by immediate intuition 
we should have been unable to draw any inference 
from this knowledge and have been shut out from 
the discovery of that countless multitude of truths 
which though of high of paramount importance are 
not selfevident this faculty is likewise of pecu 
liar utility in order to protect us in our cogita 
tions from error and falsehood and to remove these 
if they have already crept in for every the most 
complex web of thought may be reduced to simple 
syllogisms and when this is done their truth or false 
hood at least in a logical relation flashes at once into

supposes for as the essential nature of reasoning 
consists in this — that some doubt should be removed 
by the application to it of some decisive general rule 
there are to every syllogism three and only three requi 
sites necessary ° a doubt — which of two contra 
dictory predicates must be affirmed of a certain sub 
ject — the problem or question problems quassitum 
° the application of a decisive general rule to the 
doubt and ° the general rule itself but these 
requisites when the syllogism is constructed and ex 
pressed change their places so that the general rule 
stands first the application of it to the doubt stands 
second and the decision in regard to the doubt 
itself stands last each of these necessary constituents 
of a syllogism forms by itself a distinct though a cor 
relative proposition every syllogism therefore con 
tains three propositions and these three propositions 
in their complement and correlation constitute the 
syllogism” it will be proper however here to dictate 
a paragraph expressive of the denominations techni

of its essential parts the whole nomenclature 
of the syllogistic parts be it observed has refer 
ence to the onesided views of the logicians in 
regard to the process of reasoning 

the syllogism is divided into two parts the ante 
cedent and the consequent — the antecedent compre 
hending the two propositions in which the middle 
notion is compared with the two notions wo would 
compare together and the consequent comprising the 
one proposition which explicitly enounces the relation 
implicitly given in the prior of these two notions to 
each other

these as terms of relation vary of course with the 
relation in the counter quantities the one proposi 
tion which constitutes the consequent is called among 
other appellations the conclusion perhaps the best 
names for these three relative propositions of a syllo 
gism would be sumption subsumption conclusion 
as those which express most briefly and naturally the 
nature and reciprocal dependence of the three judg 
ments of a syllogism in the first place the expres 
sions sumption and subsumption are appropriate 
logical expressions in consequence of their both show 
ing that logic considers them not as absolutely but 
only as hypothetically true for logic does not war 
rant the truth of the premises of a syllogism it only 
on the supposition that these premises are true guar 
antees the legitimacy of the inference — the necessity 
of the conclusion it is on this account that the pre 
mises have by the greek logicians been very properly 
styled jxaata corresponding to the latin sump 
tiones and were there any necessity to resort to 
greek the major proposition which i would call 
sumption sumptio might be well denominated 
lemma simply and the minor proposition which 
i would call the subsumption subsumptio might be 
well denominated the hypolemma in the second 
place though both premises are sumptions or lem 
mata yet the term sumption as specially applied to 
the major premise is fully warranted both by pre 
cedent and principle for in like manner the major 
proposition — the major lemma has always obtained 
both from the greek and latin logicians the generic 
term — it has been called the proposition the

lfct this is the judgment which includes and allows both 
xv the others it is well entitled as the principal proposi 
tion to the style and title of the proposition the 
auurop lemma the sumption by preeminence in the third 
place the term subsumption is preferable to the term 
assumption as a denomination of the minor premise 
for the term subsumption precisely marks out its rela 
tion of subordination to the major premise whereas 
the term assumption does not assumption would 
indeed in contrast to subsumption have been an 
unexceptionable word by which to designate the major 
proposition had it not been that logicians have very 
generally employed it to designate the minor so that 
to reverse its application would be productive of 
inevitable confusion but for this objection i should 
certainly have preferred the term assumption to that 
of sumption for the appellation of the major proposi 
tion not that in itself it is a preferable expression 
but simply because assumption is a word of familiar 
usage in the english language which sumption and 
subsumption certainly are not 

objections the preceding arc reasons why the relative terms 
minmiom of sumption and subsumption ought to be employed as 
tionauf tile being positively good expressions but the expediency 
ordinary “ of their adoption becomes still more manifest when 
they are compared and contrasted with corresponding 
major pro denominations in ordinary use for the terms major 

position and 

premia® proposition and mo jov premise minor proposition and 
p lum and minor premise are exposed to various objections in 
the first place they are complex and tedious expres 
sions whereas sumption and subsumption are simple 
and direct in the second place the abbreviations in

major the minor proposition being called the minor

are ambiguous not only in consequence of tlieir vague lect 

ness in general but because there are two other parts — 

of the syllogism to which these expressions major and 
minor may equally apply for as you will soon be 
informed the two notions which we compare together 
through a third are called the major and the minor 
terms of the syllogism so that when we talk of 
majors and minors in reference to a syllogism it re 
mains uncertain whether we employ these words to 
denote the propositions or the terms of a reasoning 

still more objectionable are the correlative terms pro 
position and assumption as synonyms for the major 
and minor premises the term proposition is a word proposition 

a ¦ assump 

in too constant employment in its vague and general ion 
sense to be unambiguously used in a signification so 
precise and special as the one in question and in 
consequence of this ambiguity its employment in 
this signification has been in fact long veiy generally 
abandoned again the term assumption does not 
express the distinctive peculiarity of the minor pre 
mise — that of being a subordinate proposition — a 
proposition taken or assumed under another this 
word would indeed as i have noticed have been 
applied with far greater propriety had it been used to 
denote the major in place of the minor premise of a 
syllogism 

these are among the reasons which have inclined of

lkct out reference to logic it appears marvellous how in 
xv english philosophy we could so long do without the 
noun subsumption and the verb to subsume for these 
denote a relation which we have very frequently oc 
casion to express and to express which there are no 
other terms within our reach we have already in 
english assumption and assume presumption and 
presume consumption and consume and there is no 
imaginable reason why we should not likewise enrich 
the language to say nothing of sumption by the ana 
logous expressions subsumption and subsume 

thccondu in regard to the proposition constituting the con 
sequent of a syllogism the name which is generally 
bestowed on it — the conclusion — is not exposed to 
any serious objections there is thus no reason why 
it should be superseded and there is in fact no other 
term entitled to a preference so much in reference 
to the terms by which the proximate parts of a syllo 
gism are denoted i now proceed to state to you in 
general the division of syllogisms into species deter 
mined by these parts and shall then proceed to con 
sider these several species in detail but i have first 
of all to state to you a division of syllogisms which 
as comprehending ought to precede all others it is 
that of syllogisms into extensive and comprehen 
sive 


par lv it lv the first division of syllogisms is 

ianvfsyi taken from the different kinds of quantity under 

emive which the reasoning proceeds for while every 

prchcntvc syllogism infers that the part of a part is a part 
of the whole it does this either in the quantity 
of extension — the predicate of the two notions 
compared in the question and conclusion being

the greatest whole and the subject the smallest lect 
part or in the counter quantity of comprehen vi 

sion — the subject of these two notions being the 
greatest whole and the predicate the smallest 
part 


after what i have already stated in regard to 
the nature of these opposite quantities under the 
doctrine of concepts and judgments® and after the 
illustrations i have given you of the possibility of 
conducting any reasoning in either of these quanti 
ties at will — every syllogism in the one quantity 
being convertible into a syllogism absolutely equi 
valent in the other quantity — it will be here need 
less to enlarge upon the nature of this distinction in 
general this distinction comprehends all others 
and its illustration therefore supposes that the nature 
of the various subordinate classes of syllogisms should 
be previously understood it will therefore be expe 
dient not at present to enter on any distinct consider 
ation of this division of reasonings but to show when 
treating of syllogisms under their various subaltern 
classes how each is capable of being cast in the mould 
of either quantity and not as logicians suppose in 
that of extensive quantity alone 

the next distinction of syllogisms is to be sought matter mi 
for either in the constituent elements of which they 
are composed or in the manner in which these are 
connected the former of these is technically called 
the matter of a syllogism the latter its form you 
must however observe that these terms are here used 
in a restricted meaning both matter and form under 
this distinction are included in the form of a syllogism

lkct when we speak of form in contrast to tbe empirical 
— — l matter which it may contain this therefore is a 
distinction under that form with which logic as you 
know is exclusively conversant and the matter here 
spoken of should be called for distinction’s sake the 
formal or necessary matter of a syllogism in this 
sense then the matter of a syllogism means merely the 
propositions and terms of which every syllogism is 
necessarily made up ° whereas otherwise the form of 
a syllogism points out the way in which these consti 
tuents are connected this being understood i 
repeat that the next distinction of syllogisms is to be 
sought for either in their matter or in their form 

their form “ now in regard to their matter syllogisms cannot

tinction of the same constituent parts — a question the subsump

the actual enunciation of a syllogism change as i 
have already noticed their relative situation ” y — 
what was first in the order of thought being last in 
the order of expression 

the form “ the difference of syllogisms can therefore only 
twoldft be sought for in their different forms so that their 
external distinctions are only formal but the form of a syllo 
gism considered in its greatest generality is of a two 
fold kind viz either an internal and essential or an 
external and accidental the former of these depends 
on the relations of the constituent parts of the syllo

gism to each other as determined by the nature of the 
thinking subject itself the latter of these depends on 
the external expression of the constituent parts of the 
syllogism whereby the terms and propositions are 
variously determined in point of number position 
and consecution we must therefore in conformity 
to the order of nature first of all consider what classes 
of syllogism are given by their internal or essential 
form and thereafter inquire what are the classes 
afforded by their external or accidental modifications 
first then in regard to the internal or essential form 
of syllogism 

“ a syllogism is only a syllogism when the conclu 
sion follows from the premises with an absolute cer 
tainty and as this certainty is determined by a 
universal and necessary law of thought there must 
consequently be as many kinds of syllogism as there 
are various kinds of premises affording a consequence 
in virtue of a different law between the premises 
there is only one possible order of dependency for it 
is always the sumption — the major premise which as 
the foundation of the whole syllogism must first be 
taken into account and in determining the difference 
of syllogisms the sumption is the only premise which 
can be taken into account as affording a difference of 
syllogism for the minor premise is merely the sub 
sumption of the lesser quantity of the two notions 
concerning whose relation we inquire under the ques 
tion and this premise always appears in one and the 
same form — in that namely of a categorical pro 
position the same is likewise the case in regard to 
the conclusion and therefore we can no more look 
towards the conclusion for a determination of the 
diversity of syllogism than towards the subsumption

syiulfm which has been denominated categorical and in 
sir regard to the meaning and history of the term cate 
gorical it will not be necessary to say anything in 
addition to what i have already stated in speaking of 
the term judgments® as used originally by aristotle the term 
cattgorual ca t g r ca g meant merely affirmative and was opposed 

to negative by theophrastus it was employed in the 
sense of absolute — simple — direct and as opposed to 
conditional and in this signification it has continued 
to be employed by all subsequent logicians without 
their having been aware that aristotle never employed 
it in the meaning in which alone they used it

if lvii a categorical syllogism is a reasoning 
whose form is determined by the laws of identity

categorical proposition in a categorical syllo 
gism there are three principal notions holding 
to each other the relation of whole and part 
and these are so combined together that they 
constitute three propositions in which each prin 
cipal notion occurs twice these notions are 
called terms termini opoi and according as the 
notion is the greatest the greater or the least it 
is called the major the middle or the minor 
term the middle term is called the a rgument

minor terms are called extremes extrema aupa lect 

if the syllogism proceed in the quantity of ex 

tension and this form alone has been considered 
by logicians the predicate of the conclusion is 
the greatest whole and consequently the major 
term the subject of the conclusion the smallest 
part and consequently the minor term if the 
syllogism proceed in the quantity of compre 
hension the subject of the conclusion is the 
greatest whole and consequently the major 
term the predicate of the conclusion the small 
est part and consequently the minor term in 
either quantity the proposition in which the rela 
tion of the major term to the middle is expressed 
is the sumption or major premise and the pro 
position in which is expressed the relation of the 
middle term to the minor is the subsumption or 
minor premise the general forms of a cate 
gorical syllogism under the two quantities are 
consequently the following — 


an extensive syllogism 

b is a 
c is b 

cwa 

all man is mortal 

but cains is a man 
therefore cuius is mortal 


an intensive syllogism 

cub 
b is a 

cwa 

cains is a man 

but all man is mortal 
therefore cairn is mortal 


in these examples you are aware from what has expiic 
previously been said that the copula in the two ™ 
different quantities is precisely of a counter meaning 
in the quantity of extension signifying contained 
under in the quantity of comprehension signifying 
contains in it thus taking the several formulae the 


a sec above p — ed 


 



g 


lectures on logic 


extensive syllogism will when explicitly enounced be 
as follows — 

the middle term b is contained under the major term a 

but the minor term c is contained under the middle term b 
therefore the minor term c is also contained under the major 
term a 

or to take the concrete example — 

the middle term all men is contained under the major term 
mortal 

but the minor term cuius is contained under the middle term 
all men 

therefore the minor term cuius is also contained under the 
major term mortal 

of the in on the contrary the intensive syllogism when ex 
plicated is as follows — 

the major term c contains in it the middle term b 

but the middle term b contains in it the minor term a 

therefore the major term c also contains in it the minor term a 

or in the concrete example — 

the major term cains contains in it the middle term man 

but the middle term man contains in it the minor term mortal 

therefore the major term cains also contains in it the minor 
term mortal 

thus you see that by reversing the order of the two 
premises and by reversing the meaning of the copula 
we can always change a categorical syllogism of the 
one quantity into a categorical syllogism of the other 

in this paragraph is enounced the general nature of 
a categorical syllogism as competent in both the 
quantities of extension and comprehension or with 
more propriety of comprehension and extension for 
comprehension as prior to extension in the order of

nature and of knowledge ought to stand first but 
as all logicians with the doubtful exception of aris 
totle have limited their consideration to that process 
of reasoning given in the quantity of extension to the 
exclusion of that given in the quantity of compre 
hension it will be proper in order to avoid misappre 
hension to place some of the distinctions expressed in 
this paragraph in a still more explicit contrast 

in the reasonings under both quantities the words 
expressive of the relations and of the things related 
are identical the things compared in both quantities 
are the same in nature and in number in each there

are three notions three terms and three propositions trusted 
combined in the same complexity and in each 
quantity the same subordination of a greatest a 
greater and a least the same relatives and the 
same relations are found in both quantities but 
though the relations and the relatives be the same 
the relatives have changed relations for while the 
relation between whole and part is the one uniform 
relation in both quantities and while this relation is 
thrice realised in each between the same terms yet 
the term which in the one quantity was the least is 
in the other the greatest and the term which in both 
is intermediate is in the one quantity contained by 
the term which in the other it contained 

now you are to observe that logicians looking narrow and 
only to the reasoning competent under the quantity sssm 
of extension and therefore looking only to the possi of thf m““ 
bility of a single relation between the notions or terms imi minor ’

plated this is seen in their definitions of the major 
middle and minor terms 

in regard to the first they all simply define the 
major term to be the predicate of the conclusion 
this is true of the reasoning under extension but of 
that exclusively for the major term that is the 
term which contains both the others — in the reasoning 
of comprehension is the subject of the conclusion 
again the minor term they all simply define to be 
the subject of the conclusion and this is likewise 
true only of the reasoning under extension for in the 
reasoning under comprehension the minor term is the 
predicate of the conclusion finally they all simply 
define the middle term as that which is contained 
under the predicate and contains under it the subject 
of the conclusion but this definition like those of 
the two other terms must be reversed as applied to 
the reasoning under comprehension i have been 
thus tediously explicit in order that you should be 
fully aware of the contrast of the doctrine i propose 
to what you will find in logical books and that you 
may be prepared for the further development of this 
doctrine — for its application in detail 

in regard to the nomenclature of major minor and 
middle terms it is not necessary to say much the 
expression term terminus opos was first employed 
by aristotle and like the greater part of his logical 
vocabulary was as i have observed borrowed from 
the language of mathematics® you are aware that 
the word term is applied to the ultimate constituents 
both of propositions and of syllogisms the terms of 
a proposition are the subject and predicate the terms 
of a syllogism are the three notions which in their

threefold combination form the three propositions of lect 

a syllogism the major and minor terms aristotle 

by another mathematical metaphor calls the extremes 
akpa the major and minor extremes and his defi aristotles 
nition of these and of the middle term is unlike those tho terras 
of the subsequent logicians so general that it will a l ° 
apply with perfect propriety to a syllogism in either 
quantity “ i call” he says “ the middle term that 
which is both itself in another and another in it and 
which by its position lies in the middle the extremes 
i call both that which is in another and that in which 
another is” ° and in another place he says “ i define 
the major extreme that in which the middle is the 
minor extreme that which is subordinated to the 
middle” 

i may notice that the part of his definition of the his dcfmi 
middle term where he describes it as “ that which by midd°io ° 
its position lies in the middle” does not apply to the middle by 
mode in which subsequent logicians enounce the syllo applicable 
gism for let a be the major b the middle and c ih ibidt 
the minor term of an extensive syllogism this will logicians

be expressed thus — syllogism 

sumption b is a t e b is contained under a 

subsumption c is b i e c is contained under b 

conclusion c is a i e c is also contained under a 

in this syllogism the middle term b stands first but quite 
and last in the premises and therefore aristotle’s uf tie rca 
definition of the middle term not only as middle by comprchcn 
nature containing the minor and contained by the ° u ‘ 
major but as middle by position standing after the 
major and before the minor becomes inept it w t ill

two premises it will stand as follows — 


sumption c is b i c c contains in it b 

subsumption b is a i c b contains in it a 

conclusion c is a i c c also contains in it a 


it does not it does not however follow from this that aristotle 
foiiowthat either contemplated exclusively the reasoning in com 
contcmpiat prehension or that he contemplated the reasonings in 
sively the both quantities for it is very easy to state a reason 
comprehen ing in extension so that the major term shall stand 
first the middle term second and the minor last we 
can state it thus — 


sumption a is b i e a contains under it b 

subsumption b is c i e b contains under it c 

conclusion a is c i c a contains under it c 


this is as good a syllogism in extension as the first 
though it is not stated in the mode usual to logicians 
we may also convert it into a comprehensive syllo 
gism by reversing its premises and the meaning of 
the copula though here also the mode of expression 
will be unusual 


sumption b is c e b is contained in c 

subsumption a is b i e a is contained in b

from this you will see that it is not to the mere 
external arrangement of the terms but to the nature 
of their relation that we must look in determining the 
character of the syllogism 

most con before leaving the consideration of the terms of a 
mojo of syllogism i may notice that the most convenient mode 
bwiogfsm of stating a syllogism in an abstract form is by the 
 tract form letters s p and m — s signifying the subject as p 
the predicate of the conclusion and m the middle 
term of the syllogism this you will be pleased to

recollect as we shall find it necessary to employ this lect 
notation in showing the differences of syllogisms from h 
the different arrangement of their terms 

i have formerly stated that categorical syllogisms categorical 
are regulated by the fundamental laws of identity divide into 
and contradiction the law of identity regulating ac 
affirmative the law of contradiction negative cate the applica 
goricals as however the laws of identity and r 
contradiction are capable of certain special appliea mdcon 
tions these will afford the ground of a division of under the 
categorical syllogisms into a corresponding number wide ’ 
of classes it has been already stated that all reason parl 
ing is under the relation of whole and part and con 
sequently the laws of identity and contradiction will 
find their application to categorical syllogisms only 
under this relation 

but the relation of whole and part may be regarded tic relation 
in two points of view for we may either look from and pan 
the whole to the parts or look from the parts to the gaici in 
whole this being the case may we not apply the vicwtud 
principles of identity and contradiction in such a way two clasacn 
that we either reason from the whole to the parts or mg 
from the parts to the whole let us consider — look 
ing at the whole and the parts together on the prin 
ciple of identity we are assured that the whole and 
all its parts are one — that whatever is true of the 
one is true of the other — that they are only different 
expressions for the different aspects in which we may 
contemplate what in itself is absolutely identical on 
the principle therefore that the whole is only the sum 
of the parts i am entitled on the one hand looking 
from the whole to its parts to say with absolute cer 
tainty — what belongs to a whole belongs to its part 
and what does not belong to a whole does not belong to

lect its part and on the other looking from the parts to 
 — their whole to say — what makes up all the parts con 
stitutes the whole and what does not make up all the 
parts does not constitute the whole now these two 
applications of the principles of identity and contra 
diction as we look from one term of the relation of 
whole and part or from the other determine two dif 
ferent kinds of reasoning for if we reason down 
wards from a containing whole to a contained part 
we shall have one sort of reasoning which is called 
the deductive whereas if we reason upwards from 
the constituent parts to a constituted whole we shall 
have another sort of reasoning which is called the 
inductive this i shall briefly express in the follow 
ing paragraph 

f lviii categorical syllogisms are deductive 
if on the principles of identity and contradic 
tion we reason downwards from a containing 
whole to a contained part they are inductive 
if on these principles we reason upwards from 
the constituent parts to a constituted whole

of reasoning will be properly explained when after 
having expounded the nature of the former we proceed 
to consider the nature of the latter we shall now 
therefore consider the character of the deductive pro

process is at once meagre and incorrect and first — — — 
of the proximate canons by which deductive cate 
goricals are regulated 

lix in deductive categoricals the uniparlix 
versal laws of identity and contradiction take catcgori 
two modified forms according as these syllo canons 
gisms proceed in the quantity of comprehen 
sion or in that of extension the peculiar 
canon by which intensive syllogisms of this 
class are regulated is — what belongs to the 
predicate belongs also to the subject what is 
repugnant to the predicate is repugnant also to the 
subject the peculiar canon by which extensive 
syllogisms of this class are regulated is — what 
belongs to the genus belongs to the species and 
individual what is repugnant to the genus is 
repugnant to the species and individual or 
more briefly what pertains to the higher class 
pertains also to the lower 

both these laws are enounced by aristotle® and ex p iic 
both from him have passed into the writings of i ‘ 
subsequent logicians the former as usually ex 
pressed is — prcedicatum prcedicati esl etiam prcedi 
catwn subjecti or nota notes est etiam nota rei ipsius 

the latter is correspondent to what is called the 
dicta de omni et de nullo the dictum de omni 
when least ambiguously expressed being — qnicquid 
de omni valet valet etiam de quibusdam et singulis — 
and the dictum de nullo being — quicquid de nullo 
valet nec de quibusdam nec de singulis valet but as

you are now prepared for the statement and illus prliniauj 
tration of the various proximate rules by which all 
categorical syllogisms are regulated and first in j yl p £ i ”‘ 
regard to these rules in relation to the reasoning of itc 
extension 

“ aldrich” says dr whately “ has given twelve 
rules which i find might be more conveniently re 
duced to six no syllogism can be faulty which 
violates none of these rules”® this reduction of the 
syllogistic rules to six is not original to dr whately 
but had he looked a little closer into the matter he 
might have seen that the six which he and other 
logicians enumerate may without any sacrifice of 
precision and with even an increase of perspicuity be 
reduced to three i shall state these in a paragraph 
and then illustrate them in detail 


if lx an extensive categorical syllogism pw 
if regularly and fully expressed is governed by 
the three following rules — eumiyo 

° categorical 

i it must have three and only three terms byiiogiam 
constituting three and only three propositions

lect ii of the premises the sumption must in 

— quantity be definite ie universal or singular 

and the subsumption in quality affirmative 

iii the conclusion must correspond in quan 
tity with the subsumption and in quality with 
the sumption® 

illustration these three simple laws comprise all the rules which 
logicians lay down with so confusing a minuteness p 
the first is — a categorical syllogism if regular and 
perfect must have three and only three propositions 
made up of three and only three terms “ the neces 
sity of this rule is manifest from the very notion of a 
categorical syllogism in a categorical syllogism the 
relation of two notions to each other is determined 
through their relation to a third and consequently 
each must be compared once with the intermediate 
notion and once with each other it is thus mani 
fest that there must be three and cannot possibly be 
more than three terms and that these three terms 
must in their threefold comparison constitute three 
ilriytoc’ an onl y three propositions it is however to be 
m observed that it may often happen as if in a valid 
syllogism there were more than three principal notions 
— three terms but in that case the terms or notions 
are only complex and expressed by a plurality ol 
words ilence it is that each several notion extant 
in a syllogism and denoted by a separate word is not 
on that account to be viewed as a logical term or

terminus but only those which either singly or in lect 
connection with others constitute a principal momen — 
turn of the syllogism”” thus in the following syllo 
gism there are many more than three several notions 
expressed by three several words but these we shall 
find constitute in reality only three principal notions 
or logical terms — 

sumption he who conscientiously perform hi duty is a 

truly good man 

subsumption socrates conscientiously perform s hi s duty 

conclusion therefore socrates is a trtdy good man 

here there are in all seven several notions denoted 
by seven separate words — conscientiously per 
forms duty truly good man socrates 
but only three principal notions or logical terms — viz 

 conscientiously performs his duty trtdy good 
man socrates 

“ when on the other hand the expression of the quatcmw 
middle term in the sumption and subsumption is used rum 
in two significations there may in that case appear 
to be only three terms while there are in reality four 
or as it is technically styled in logic a quatemio ter 
minorump on this account the syllogism is vicious 
in point of form and consequently can afford no in 
ference howbeit that the several propositions may in 
point of matter be all true and why — because there 
is here no mediation consequently no connection be 
tween the different terms of the syllogism for ex 
ample — 

the animals are void of reason 

man is an animal 

therefore man is void of reason

lectures on logic 


lect “ here the conclusion is invalid though each propo 

— sition by itself and in a certain sense may be true 

for here the middle term animal is not taken in the 
same meaning in the major and minor propositions 
for in the former it is taken in a narrower significa 
tion as convertible with brute in the latter in a 
wider signification as convertible with animated or 
ganism 

second the second rule is — of the premises the sumption 
must in quantity be definite universal or singular 
the subsumption must in quality be affirmative — the 
sumption must in reference to its quantity be definite 
because it affords the general rule of the syllogism 
for if it were indefinite that is particular we should 
have no security that the middle term in the sub 
sumption comprised the same part of the sphere 
which it comprised in the sumption p 
tlius — m 

some m are p 

all s are m 

all s are p 

or in a concrete example — 

same works of art are cubical 

all pictures are works of art 

therefore all pictures are cubical 

in regard to the subsumption this is necessarily 
affirmative the sumption is not limited to either 
quality because the proposition enouncing a general 
rule may indifferently declare all m is p and no m 
is p the assumption is thus indeterminate in regard 
to quality but not so the proposition enouncing the 
application pf a general rule for it must subsume

that is it must affirm that something is contained lect 
undei a condition and is therefore necessarily affir xv ‘ 
mative we must say s is m but in respect of 
quantity it is undetermined for we can either say all 
s ts m or some s is m if the subsumption is nega 
tive there is no inference for it is not necessary that 
a genus should contain only things of a certain species 

this is shown in the following example — 

all men arc animals 

mo horse is a man 

therefore no luirse is an aninutl 

or as abstractly expressed — 

 

all m are p 

but no s is it 

mo s is p 

ihus it is that in a regular extensive categorical 
syllogism the sumption must be always definite in 
quantity the subsumption always affirmative in 
quality 

i have however to add an observation requisite to minp 
prevent the possibility of a misconception in stating 
it as a rule of extensive categoricals that the sumption “™“” 
must be definite universal or singular if you are at ™° n yx 
all conversant with logical books you will have noticed obtt d 
that this rule is not in unison with the doctrine therein 
taught and you may accordingly be surprised that i 
should enounce as a general rule what is apparently con 
tradicted by the fact that there are syllogisms — valid 
syllogisms — of various forms in which the sumption is 
a particular or the subsumption a negative proposi

posed in the expression you will hereafter find that

the mere order in which the premises and conclusion 
of a syllogism are enounced no more changes their 
nature and their necessary relation to each other than 
does the mere order in which the grammatical parts 
of a sentence are expressed alter their essential char 
acter and reciprocal dependence in the phrases vir 
bon us and bonus vir — in both the vir is a substantive

vicit alexander — vicit alexander darium — vicit 
darium alexander — in these a difference of order

various constituent notions but no difference of their 
grammatical or logical relations it is the same with 
syllogisms the mere order of enunciation does not 
change a sumption into a subsumption nor a sub

one proposition a major and the other a minor pre

plexed by the recognition of a multitude of different lect 

forms as real and distinct which exist only and are — 

only distinguished by certain fortuitous accidents of 
expression this being understood you will not mar 
vel at the rule in regard to the quantity of sumptions 
in extensive syllogisms which however i limited to 
those that were regularly and fully expressed — that 
it must be definite nor will you marvel at the 
counter canon in regard to the quality of sumptions 
in intensive syllogisms — that it must be affirmative® 

the necessity of the last rule is equally manifest as 
that of the preceding it is — the conclusion must third rule 
correspond in quantity with the subsumption and in 
quality with the sumption “ this rule is otherwise 
enounced by logicians — the conclusion must always 
follow the weaker or worser part — the negative and 
the particular being held to be weaker or worser in 
relation to the affirmative and universal the con 
clusion in extensive categoricals with which we are 
at present occupied is made up of the minor term 
as subject and of the major term as predicate now 
as the relation of these two terms to each other is de 
termined by their relation to the middle term and as 
the middle term is compared with the major term in 
the sumption it follows that the major term must 
hold the same relation to the minor in the conclusion 
which it held to the middle in the sumption if then 
the sumption is affirmative so likewise must be the 
conclusion on the other hand if the sumption be 
negative so likewise must be the conclusion in the

in my last lecture after terminating the considera lkct

govern the legitimacy and regularity of deductive

are the axioms of identity and contradiction by which 
all categorical syllogisms are controlled these when

comprehension and extension constitute two canons 
— the canon of the intensive syllogism being — what 
belongs to the predicate belongs also to the subject — 
what is repugnant to the predicate is repugnant also 
to the subject — the canon of the extensive syllogism 
being — what belongs to the genus belongs also to 
the species and individual — what is repugnant to the 
genus is repugnant also to the species and individual 
each of these however in its more proximate appli 
cation is still further developed into a plurality of 
more explicit rules in reference to extensive syllo 
gism the general law or the dictum da omni et de 
nullo as it is technically called is evolved into a 
series of rules which have been multiplied to twelve 
are usually recalled to six but which throwing out 
of account irregular and imperfect syllogism may be 
conveniently reduced to three these are i an ex 
tensive categorical deductive syllogism must have 
three and only three terms — constituting three and 
only three propositions ii the sumption must in 
quantity be definite ie universal or singular the 
subsumption must in quality be affirmative iii the 
conclusion must correspond in quantity with the sub 
sumption and in quality with the sumption the 
lecture concluded with an explanation of these rules 
in detail 

we have now therefore next to consider into what 
rules the law of intensive or comprehensive syllogism 
is developed in its more proximate application now 
as the intensive and extensive syllogisms are always 
the counterparts of each other the proximate rules of 
the two forms must consequently be either precisely 
the same or precisely the converse of each other 
accordingly taking the three rules of extensive syllo 
gisms we find that the first law is also without dif

ference a rule of intensive syllogisms but the second lfct 
and third to maintain their essential identity must xv 
be externally converted for to change an extensive 
syllogism into an intensive we must transpose the 
order or subordination of the two premises and re 
verse the reciprocal relation of the terms the three 
general rules of an intensive categorical deductive 
syllogism will therefore stand as follows —

gular 

iii the conclusion must not exceed the sump 
tion in quantity and in quality must agree with 
the subsumption 


in regard to the first of these rules — the rule which expiic 
is identical for syllogisms whether extensive or inten rulo 
sive it is needless to say anything for all that i 
stated in regard to it under the first of these forms 
is valid in regard to it under the second 

i proceed to the second which is — the sumption sont 
must in quality be affirmative the subsumption must rul ° 
in quantity be definite that is universal or singular 

and here we have to answer the question — why in 
an intensive syllogism must the sumption be affirma 
tive in quality the subsumption definite in quantity 

let us take the following syllogism as explicated —

syllogisms 


s comirreheiuls m 

m does not comprehend p 

therefore s does not comprehend p 

prudence comprehends virtue 

but virtue docs not comprehend blameworthy 

therefore priulencc does not comprehend blameworthy 

here all goes on regularly we descend from the major 
term prudence to the middle term virtue and from 
the middle term virtue to the minor term blameworthy 
but let us reverse the premises we at once see that 
though there is still a discoverable meaning it is not 
directly given and that we must rectify and restore 
in thought what is perverse and preposterous in ex 
pression in the previous example the sumption is 
affirmative the subsumption negative now let us 
take a negative sumption — 

s does not comprehend m 

but m comprehends p 

here there is no conclusion competent for we can 
neither say s comprehends p nor s does not compre 
hend p or to take a concrete example — 

prudence does not comprehend learning 

but learning comprehends praiseworthy 

we can draw it is evident no conclusion for we 
can neither say from the relation of the two proposi 
tions that prudence comprehends praiseworthy nor 
that prudence does not comprehend praiseworthy 

the reason why an extensive syllogism requires a 
universal sumption and an intensive syllogism an 
affirmative and why the one requires an affirmative 
and the other a definite subsumption is the following 
the condition common to both syllogisms is that the 
sumption should express a rule but in the extensive 
syllogism this law is an universal rule that is a rule 


 


 


lectures on logic 


to which there is no exception but then it may be 
expressed either in an affirmative or in a negative 
form whereas in the intensive syllogism this law is 
expressed as a position — as a fact and therefore 
admits only of an affirmative form but as it is not 
necessarily universal it admits of limitations or ex 
ceptions this opposite character of the sumptions 
of the two forms of syllogisms is correspondent to the 
opposite character of their subsumptions in the 
extensive syllogism the subsumption is and can only 
be an affirmative declaration of the application of 
the sumption as a universal rule in the intensive 
syllogism the subsumption is either an affirmation or 
a negation of the application of the sumption as a 
positive law hence it is that in an intensive syllo 
gism the major premise is necessarily an affirmative 
while the minor may be either an affirmative or a 
negative proposition 

in regard to the second clause of the second rule 
the reason why the subsumption in an intensive syllo 
gism must be definite in quantity is because it would 
otherwise be impossible to affirm or deny of each other 
the minor and the major terms in the conclusion 
for example — 


lect

sumption prudence is a virtue i e prudence comprehends 

virtue 

subsumption some virtue is praiseworthy i o some virtue 
comprehends praiseworth y 


from these we can draw no conclusion for the inde 
finite some virtue does not connect the major term 
prudence and the minor term praiseworthy into the 
necessary relation of whole and part 

in regard to the third rule — the conclusion must thini rule 
be correspondent in quantity with the sumption and 
in quality with the subsumption — it is not necessary

— what 


to say anything here as in the extensive syllogism 
the conclusion cannot be stronger than the weakest 
of its antecedents that is if any premise be negative 
the conclusion cannot but be negative also and if 
any premise be particular the conclusion cannot be 
but particular likewise and as a w r eaker quality is 
only foimd in the subsumption and a weaker quantity 
in the sumption it follows that as the rule declares 
the conclusion is regulated by the sumption in re 
gard to its quantity and by the subsumption in 
regard to its quality it is however evident that 
though warranted to draw a universal conclusion from 
a general sumption it is always competent to draw 
only a particular 

so much for the proximate laws by which cate 
gorical deductive syllogisms are governed when con 
sidered as perfect and regular in external form we 
shall in the sequel have to consider the special rules 
by which the varieties of deductive categorical syl 
logisms as determined by their external form are 
governed but at present we must proceed to the 
general consideration of the other class of categorical 
syllogisms afforded by their internal form — i mean 
those of induction the discussion of which i shall 
commence by the following paragraph 

if lxii an inductive categorical syllogism 
is a reasoning in which we argue from the notion 
of all the constituent parts discretively to the 
notion of the constituted whole collectively its 
general laws are identical with those of the 
deductive categorical syllogism and it may 
be expressed in like manner either in the form 
of an intensive or of an extensive syllogism

we shall in the sequel have to consider more lect

particularly the nature and peculiarities of logical l 

induction when we come to treat of the figure of 
syllogism and when we consider the nature of logical kituro 
or formal in contrast to philosophical or peal indue jndusj 
tion under the head of modified logic at present erroneou 

i shall only say that all you will find in logical works 
of the character of logical induction is utterly erro 
neous for almost all logicians except aristotle 
consider induction not as regulated by the necessary 
laws of thought but as determined by the probabilities 
and presumptions of the sciences from which its matter 
has accidentally been borrowed they have not con 
sidered it logically in its formal but only extra 
logically in its material conditions thus logicians 
have treated in logic of the inductive inference from 
the parts to the whole not as exclusively warranted 
by the law of identity in the convertibility of the 
whole and all its parts but they have attempted to 
establish an illation from a few of these parts to the 
whole and this either as supported by the general 
analogies of nature or by the special presumptions 
afforded by the several sciences of objective existence® 

logicians with the exception of aristotle who is the charac 
however very brief and unexplicit in his treatment of cal or for 
this subject have thus deformed their science andrcaiot dof 
perplexed the very simple doctrine of logical induction iidsm 
by confounding formal with material induction all 
inductive reasoning is a reasoning from the parts to 
the whole but the reasoning from the parts to the 
whole in the various material or objective sciences is 
very different from the reasoning from the parts to

the whole in the one formal or subjective science of 
logic in the former the illation is not simply 
founded on the law of identity in the convertibility 
of a whole and all its parts but on certain presump 
tions drawn from an experience or observation of the 
constancy of nature so that in these sciences the 
inference to the whole is rarely from all but generally 
from a small number of its constituent parts conse 
quently in them the conclusion is rarely in truth an 
induction properly so called but a mixed conclusion 
drawn on an inductive presumption combined with a 
deductive premise for example the physical philo 
sopher thus reasons — 

this that and the other magnet attract iron 

but this that and the other magnet represent all magnets 

therefore all magnets attract iron 

now in this syllogism the legitimacy of the minor 
premise this that and the other magnet represent all 
magnets is founded on the principle that nature is 
uniform and constant and on this general principle 
the reasoner is physically warranted in making a few 
parts equivalent to the whole but this process is 
wholly incompetent to the logician the logician 
knows nothing of any principles except the laws of 
thought he cannot transcend the sphere of neces 
sary and pass into the sphere of probable thinking 
nor can he bring back and incorporate into his own 
formal science the conditions which regulate the 
procedure of the material sciences this being the 
case induction is either not a logical process different 
from deduction for the induction of the objective 
philosopher in so far as it is formal is in fact deduc 
tive or there must be an induction governed by 
other laws than those which warrant the induction of

the objective philosopher now if logicians had lect 
looked to their own science and not to sciences with x y 
which as logicians they had no concern they would 
have seen that there is a process of reasoning from djcti“ d syl 
the parts to the whole as well as from the whole to f “ 
the parts that this process is governed by its own m l 
laws and is equally necessary and independent as 
the other the rule by which the deductive syllo 
gism is governed is — what belongs or does not 
belong to the containing whole belongs or does not 
belong to each and all of the contained parts the 
rule by which the inductive syllogism is governed 
is — what belongs or does not belong to all the 
constituent parts belongs or does not belong to 
the constituted whole these rules exclusively deter 
mine all formal inference whatever transcends or 
violates them transcends or violates logic both are 
equally absolute it would be not less illegal to infer 
by the deductive syllogism an attribute belonging 
to the whole of something it was not conceived to 
contain as a part than by the inductive to conclude 
of the whole what is not conceived as a predicate of 
all its constituent parts in either case the con 
sequent is not thought as determined by the ante 
cedent — the premises do not involve the conclusion”

magnet are all magnets — has been already explained lect 

to mean not that they really are so but merely that — 

they are so thought to be it is only on the supposi formui® 
tion of this that and the other magnet c being tivo syiio 
conceived to constitute the class magnet that thecompwhen 
inference proceeds and on this supposition it will not extennion 
be denied that the inference is necessary i stated 
that an inductive syllogism is equally competent in 
comprehension and in extension for example let us 
suppose that x y z represent parts and the letters 
a and b wholes and we have the following formula 
of an inductive syllogism in comprehension — 


x y z constitute a 

a comprehends b 

therefore x y z comprehend b 


this if converted into an extensive syllogism by 
transposing the premises and reversing the copula 
gives — 

a is contained under b 

x y z constitute a 

therefore x y z are contained under b 

but in this syllogism it is evident that the premises 
are in an unnatural order we must not therefore here 
transpose the premises as we do in converting a de 
ductive categorical of comprehension into one of ex 
tension we may obtain an inductive syllogism in 
two different forms and in either comprehension or 
extension according as the parts stand for the major 
or for the middle term if the minor term is formed 
of the parts it is evident there is no induction for in 
this case they only constitute that quantity of the 
syllogism which is always a part and never a whole

before leaving this subject i may notice that the 
doctrine of logical induction maintained by whately 
and many others diverges even more than that of the 
older logicians from the truth inasmuch as it makes 
this syllogism a deductive syllogism of which the 
sumption which is usually understood and not ex 
pressed is always substantially the same — viz “what 
belongs or does not belong to the individuals we 
have examined belongs or does not belong to the 
whole class under which they are contained” this 
doctrine was first i think introduced by wolf® for

the previous logicians viewed the subsumption as the lect 
common and therefore the suppressed premise this — 
premise always stating that the individuals or parti 
culars enumerated made up the class under which 
they were severally contained® for example in the 
instance from the magnet we have already taken the 
subsumption would be — this that and the other mag 
net and so forth are the whole class magnet this correct a 
doctrine of the older logicians is correct as far as it goes 
goes and to make it absolutely correct it would only 
have been necessary to have established the distinc 
tion between the logical induction as governed by the 
a priori conditions of thought and philosophical in 
duction as legitimated by the a posterioii conditions 
of the matter about which the inquiry is conversant 

this however was not done and the whole doctrine 
of logical induction was corrupted and confounded by 
logicians introducing into their science the considera 
tion of various kinds of matter and admitting as 
logical an induction supposed imperfect that is one 
in which there was inference to the whole from some 
only of the constituent parts this imperfect induction doctrine of 
they held in contingent matter to be contingent — iiics 
in necessary matter to be necessary as if a logical 
inference were not in all cases necessary and only 
necessary as governed by the necessary laws of 
thought this misapprehension of the nature of logi bacon at 
cal or formal induction and its difference from criticism of 
philosophical or material has been the reason why doctrine of

trine of induction for looking only at the doctrine 
of the inductive syllogism given by aristotle in the 
organon and not perceiving that the question there 
was only concerning the nature of induction as gov 
erned by the laws of thought he forthwith assumed 
that this was the induction practised by the stagirite 
in his study of nature and in the teeth both of the 
precept and practice of the philosopher condemned 
the aristotelic induction in the mass as flying at once 
to general principles from the hasty enumeration of a 
few individual instances induction as i mentioned 
will however once and again engage our attention 
in the sequel but i have thought it proper to be some 
what explicit that you might carry with you a clearer 
conception of the nature of this process as contrasted 
with the process of the deductive syllogism

subsumption must either affirm one of the predi lect

cates and the conclusion eo ipso consequently 

deny the other or others or it must deny one or 
more of them and thus necessitate in the conclu 
sion either the determinate affirmation of the 
other or the indeterminate affirmation of the 
others a disjunctive syllogism is thus either 
affirmative constituting the modus ponens or 
modus ponendo tollcns or negative constituting 
the modus tollens or modus tollendo ponens 

in each of these modes there are two cases 
which i comprehend in the following mnemonic 
verses — 

a affirmative or modus tonendo tollexs —

 fattens out fallor in fattens ergo ego nedum 

l negative or modus tollendo ponens —

 fattens ant fallor non fattens ergo ego fallor 


in illustration of this paragraph i have defined a expiica 
disjunctive syllogism one whose form is determined tlon 
by the law of excluded middle and whose sumption 
is accordingly a disjunctive proposition have not a syllogism 
as logicians in general do defined it directly — a syllo junctive

gism whose major premise is a disjunctive proposition mie u not 
for though it be true that every disjunctive syllogism a disjunctive 
has a disjunctive major premise the converse is not 
true for every syllogism that has a disjunctive 
sumption is not on that account necessarily a dis 
junctive syllogism for a disjunctive syllogism only 
emerges when the conclusion has reference to the 
relation of reciprocal affirmation and negation subsist

but a is

not by the law of excluded middle but solely by the 
law of identity as the following —

a is

for in both we conclude — c in one c or r is an 
attribute of b but b is an attribute of a therefore 
c c oi d is an attribute of a — a process in either 
case regulated exclusively by the law of identity 

this being premised i now proceed to a closer con 
sideration of the nature of this reasoning and shall 
first give you a general notion of its procedure then 
secondly discuss its principle and thirdly its con 
stituent parts 

° the general form of the disjunctive syllogism 
may be given in the following scheme in which you 
will observe there is a common sumption to the nega

position for it the disjunct members are more than 
two that is if there is a positive or contrary opposi 
tion there is then a twofold or manifold employment 
of the modus ponendo touens and modus tollendo 
ponens according as the affirmation and negation is 
determinate or indeterminate if in the modus po 
nendo tollens one disjunct member is determinately 
affirmed then all the others are denied and if several 
disjunct members are indeterminately affirmed except 
one then only that one is denied if in the modus 
tollendo ponens a single member of the disjunction be 
denied then some one of the others is indetermin 
ately affirmed and if several be denied so that one 
alone is left then this one is determinately affirmed” 

this will appear more clearly from the following for 
mulae let the common sumption both of the modus 
ponendo tollens and modus tollendo ponens be — 

a is cither b or c or i 

i the modus ponendo tollens —

or what is a better expression the position or subla lect 
tion of one or other of two contradictory attributes — — — 
follows from the subsumption of the opposite — there 
is necessarily implied in the disjunctive process that 
when of two opposite predicates the one is posited or 
affirmed the other is sublated or denied and that 
when the one is sublated or denied the other is 
posited or affirmed but the proposition — that of 
two repugnant attributes the one being posited the 
other must be sublated and the one being sublated 
the other must be posited — is at once manifestly the 
law by which the disjunctive syllogism is governed 
and manifestly only an application of the law of ex 
cluded middle for the modus ponendo tokens there 
is the special rule — if the one character be posited 
the other character is sublated and for the modus tol 
lendo ponens there is the special rule — if the one 
character be sublated the other character is posited 

the law of the disjunctive syllogism is here enounced 
only in reference to the case in which the members 
of disjunction are contradictorily opposed an oppo 
sition of contrariety is not of purely logical concern 
ment and a disjunctive syllogism with characters 
opposed in contrariety in fact consists of as many

law — this question may be asked not only in refer 
ence to the whole syllogism but likewise in reference 
to its several parts the original and necessary form 
of a disjunctive syllogism consists as we have seen 
in the reciprocal position or sublation of contradic 
tory characters by the subsumption of one or other 
hence it follows that the disjunctive syllogism must 
like the categorical involve a threefold judgment — 
viz ° a judgment in which a subject is determined 
by two contradictory predicates ° a judgment in 
which one or other of the opposite predicates is sub 
sumed that is is affirmed either as existent or non 
existent and ° a judgment in which the final 
decision is enounced concerning the existence or non 
existence of one of the repugnant or reciprocally ex 
clusive predicates but in these three propositions 
as in the three propositions of a categorical syllogism 
there can only be three principal notions — viz the 
notion of a subject and the notion of two contradic 
tory attributes which are generally enounced in the 
sumption and of which one is posited or sublated 
in the subsumption in order that in the conclusion 
the other may be sublated or posited the case of 
contrary opposition is as we have seeu easily re 
conciled and reduced to that of contradictory oppo 
sition” ° the laws of the several parts of a disjunctive 
syllogism or more properly the original and necessary 
form of these several parts are given in the following 
paragraph —

° the sumption in relation to its quantity

° the conclusion corresponds in quantity 
with the subsumption and is opposed to it in 
quality

the first rule is — a regular and perfect disjunctive expiica 
syllogism must have three propositions in which if firt rui® 
the sumption be simple and the disjunction purely 
logical only three principal notions can be found 

“like the categorical syllogism the disjunctive consists 
of a sumption constituting the general rule of a 
subsumption containing its application and of a 
conclusion expressing the judgment inferred dis 
junctive syllogisms are therefore true and genuine 
reasonings and if in the sumption the disjunction 
be contradictory there are in the syllogism only three 
principal notions in the case of contrary disjunc 
tions there may indeed appear a greater number 
of notions but as such syllogisms are in reality 
composite and are made up of a plurality of syllo 
gisms with a contradictory disjunction this objection 
to the truth of the rule is as little valid as the cir 
cumstance that the subject in the sumption is some 
times twofold threefold fourfold or manifold as for 
example in the sumption — john james thomas are 
either virtuous or vicious for this is a copulative 
proposition which is composed of three simple pro 
positions — viz john is c if therefore there be

lkct such a sumption at the head of a disjunctive syllogism 

— it is in this case likewise composite and may be 

analysed into as many simple syllogisms with three 
principal notions as there are simple propositions into 
which the sumption may be resolved”® 

second rule the second rule is — the sumption is in relation to 
its quantity and quality always uniform — being 
universal and affirmative but the subsumption is 
susceptible of different forms in both relations if 
we look indeed to the subject alone it may seem to 
be possibly equally general or particular for we can 
equally say of some as of all a that they are either 
b or c but as all universality is relative and as the 
sumption is always more extensive or more compre 
hensive than the subsumption it is thus true that the 
sumption is always general again looking to the 
predicate or as it is complex to the predicates alone 
they as exclusive of each other appear to involve a 
negation but in looking at the whole proposition 
that is at the subject the copula and the predicates 
in connection we see at once that the copula is 
affirmative for the negation involved in the predicates 
is confined to that term alone p 
third rule in regard to the third rule which enounces — that 
the conclusion should have the same quantity with the 
subsumption but an opposite quality — it is requisite 
to say nothing as the first clause is only a special 
application of the rule common to all syllogisms that

the conclusion can contain nothing more than the lect

premises and must therefore follow the weaker part 


and the second is selfevident as only a special appli 
cation of the principle of excluded middle for on this 
law if one contradictory be affirmed in the subsump 
tion the other must be denied in the conclusion and 
if one contradictory be denied in the subsumption 
the other must be affirmed in the conclusion 

the disjunctive like every other species of syllo the du 
gism may be either a reasoning in the quantity of syllogism 
comprehension or a reasoning in the quantity of ex licnsion and 
tension the contrast however of these two quan 
tities is not manifested in the same signal manner in 
the disjunctive as in the categorical deductive syllo 
gism more especially of the first figure in the cate 
gorical deductive syllogism the reasonings in the two 
counter quantities are obtrusively distinguished by a 
complete conversion not only of the internal signifi 
cance but of the external appearance of the syllogism 

for not only do the relative terms change places in 
the relation of whole and part but the consecution of 
the antecedents is reversed the minor premise in 
the one syllogism becoming the major premise in the 
other this however is not the case in disjunctive 
syllogisms here the same proposition is in both 
quantities always the major premise and the whole 
change that takes place in converting a disjunctive 
syllogism of the one quantity into a disjunctive syllo 
gism of the other is in the silent reversal of the copula 
from one of its meanings to another this however 
as it determines no apparent difference in single pro 
positions and as the disjunctive sumption remains 
always the same proposition out of which the sub

examples 


sumption and the conclusion are evolved in the one 
quantity as in the other — the reversal of the sumption 
from extension to comprehension or from compre 
hension to extension occasions neither a real nor an 
apparent change in the syllogism take for example 
the disjunctive syllogism — 

pluto is either learned or unlearned 

but pluto is learned 

therefore plato is not unlearned 

now let us explicate this into an intensive and into 
an extensive syllogism as an intensive syllogism it 
will stand — 

pluto comprehends either the attribute learned or the attribute 
unlearned 

but pluto comprehends the attribute learned 

therefore fcc 

as an extensive syllogism it will stand — 

plato is contained either under the class learned or under the 
class unlearned 

but plato is contained under the class learned 

therefore c 

from this it appears that though the difference of 
reasoning in the several quantities of comprehension 
and extension obtains in disjunctive as in all other 
syllogisms it does not in the disjunctive syllogism 
determine the same remarkable change in the external 
construction and consecution of the parts which it 
does in categorical syllogisms

the difference of internal or essential form is the

the consequent is affirmed the other — with the

° “likeevery other species of simple syllogism lect 
the hypothetical is made up of three propositions — xx l 
a sumption a subsumption and a conclusion there 
must in the first place be an hypothetical proposition “ 
holding the place of a general rule and from this pro thlpropo 
position the other parts of the syllogism must be ” 
deduced this first proposition therefore contains a 
sumption but as this proposition contains a relative 
and correlative member — one member the relative 
clause enouncing a thing as conditioning the other 
the correlative clause enouncing a thing as condi 
tioned and as the whole proposition enounces merely 
the dependency between these relatives and judges 
nothing in regard to their existence considered apart 
and in themselves — this enouncement must be made in 
a second proposition which shall take out of the 
sumption one or other of its relatives and categori 
cally enounce its existence or its nonexistence this 
second proposition contains therefore a subsumption 
and through this subsumption a judgment is likewise 
determined in a third proposition with regard to the 
other relative this last proposition therefore con 
tains the conclusion proper of the syllogism” 

“ but as the sumption in an hypothetical syllogism in fcjrpo 
contains two relative clauses — an antecedent and aeon ogim the™ 
sequent — it therefore appears double and as either ntwfjta 
of its two members may be taken in the subsumption reasoning

syllogism is thus variously enounced — posita condi 
tione y ponitur conditionatum sublato conditionato y 
tollitur conditio or otherwise — a ratione ad ra 
tionatum a negatione rationati ad negationem rationis y 
valet consequentia the one alternative of either rule 
being regulative of the modus ponens y the other of the 
modus fallens 

“ but here it may be asked why as we conclude 
from the truth of the antecedent to the truth of the 
consequent a ratione ad rationatum y and from the 
falsehood of the consequent to the falsehood of the 
antecedent a negatione rationati ad negationem ra 
tionis y can we not conversely conclude from the truth 
of the consequent to the truth of the antecedent and 
from the falsehood of the antecedent to the falsehood 
of the consequent in answer to this question it is 
manifest that this could be validly done only on the 
following supposition — viz if every consequent had 
only one possible antecedent and if from an ante 
cedent false as considered absolutely and in itself it 
were impossible to have consequents true as facts 

“ thus in the first place it is incompetent to con 
clude that because b exists that is because the con 
sequent member of the sumption considered as an 
absolute proposition is true therefore the supposed rea 
son a exists that is therefore the alleged antecedent 
member must be true for b may have other reasons 
besides a such as c or d in like manner in the 
second place we should not be warranted to infer that 
because the supposed reason a is unreal and the 
antecedent member false therefore the result b is also 
unreal and the consequent member false for the

existence of b might be determined by many other

therefore we ought to gamble 

here the conclusion is as false as if we conversely in 
ferred that because we ought not to gamble there are 
no sharpers in the room 

“ logicians have given themselves a world of pains 
in the discovery of general rules for the conversion 
of hypothetical syllogisms into categorical but in 
the first place this is unnecessary in so far as it is 
applied to manifest the validity of an hypothetical 
syllogism for the hypothetical syllogism manifests 
its own validity with an evidence not less obtrusive 
than does the categorical and therefore it stands in 
no need of a reduction to any higher form as if it 
were of this a onesided and accidental modification 
with equal propriety might we inquire how a cate 
gorical syllogism is to be converted into an hypo 
thetical in the second place this conversion is not 
always possible and therefore it is never necessary 
in cases where the sumption of an hypothetical syllo 
gism contains only three notions and where of these 
three notions one stands to the other two in the 
relation of a middle term — in these cases an hypo 
thetical syllogism may without difficulty be reduced

to categoricals thus when the formula — if a is 
then b is signifies — if a is c then a is also b — 
that is a is b inasmuch as it is c — in this case 
the categorical form is to be viewed as the original 
and the hypothetical as the derivative ” for ex 
ample — 

if cains be a man then he is mortal 

but caius is a man 

therefore he is mortal 

here the notion man is regarded as comprehending 
in it or as contained under the notion mortal and 
as being comprehended in or as containing under 
it the notion caius it can therefore serve as 
middle term in the categorical syllogism to connect 
the two notions caius and mortal thus — 

man is mortal 

caius is man 

therefore caius is mortal 

“ in such cases it requires only to discover the 
middle term in order to reduce the hypothetical 
syllogism to a categorical form and no rules are 
requisite for those who comprehend the nature of the 
tw r o kinds of reasoning 

“ but in those cases where the sumption of an 
hypothetical syllogism contains more than three 
notions so that the formula if a is then b is 
signifies if a is c then is b also d — in such 
cases an easy and direct conversion is impossible as 
a categorical syllogism admits of only three principal 
notions to accomplish a reduction at all we must 
make a circuit through a plurality of categorical syl 
logisms before we can arrive at an identical con 
clusion — a process which so far from tending to

“ on the other hand we can always easily convert 
an hypothetical syllogism of one form into another —

contraposition of the antecedent and consequent of 
the sumption thus the ponent or constructive

but socrates is virtuous 

therefore he merits esteem 


may thus be converted into a tollent or destructive 
syllogism — 

if socrates do not merit esteem then he is not virtuous 
but lie is virtuous 

therefore lie merits esteem 


“this latter syllogism though apparently a con 
structive syllogism is in reality a destructive for 
in modo ponente we conclude from the truth of the 
antecedent to the truth of the consequent but here 
we really conclude from the falsehood of the conse

lect tlie existence or nonexistence of that constituent 
member which was not subsumed in the second judg 
ment in these three propositions — sumption sub 
sumption and conclusion — there may however be 
found more than three principal notions and this is 
always the case when the sumption contains more 
than three principal terms as is exemplified in a pro 
position like the following — if god reward virtue 
then will virtuous men be also happy here however 
it must at the same time be understood that this 
proposition in which a larger plurality of notions than 
three is apparent contains however only the thought 
of one antecedent and of one consequent for a single 
consequent supposes a whole antecedent how complex 
soever it may be and a single antecedent involves in 
it a whole consequent though made up of any number 
of parts both of these possibilities are seen in the 
example now adduced of an hypothetical judgment in 
which there occur more than three principal notions 
ground on if however an hypothetical proposition involve only 
hvpotiieti the thought of a single antecedent and of a single 
ptn ijt consequent it will follow that any hypothetical syllo 
pru i a gism consists not of more than three but of less 

having only 

two tcnn than three capital notions and m a rigorous sense 
positions this is actually the case ” on this ground accord 
ingly some logicians of great acuteness have viewed 
the hypothetical syllogism as a syllogism of two 
terms and of two propositions p this is however 
thi view erroneous for in an hypothetical syllogism there 
are virtually three terms “ that under this form of

reasoning a whole syllogism can be evolved out of lect 

not more than two capital notions depends on this — 

that the two constituent notions of an hypothetical 
syllogism present a character in the sumption alto 
gether different from what they exhibit in the sub 
sumption and conclusion in the sumption these 
notions stand bound together in the relation of reason 
and consequent without however any determination 
in regard to the reality or unreality of one or other 
if the one be then the other is is all that is enounced 

in the subsumption on the other hand the existence 
or nonexistence of what one or other of these notions 
comprises is expressly asserted and thus the concept 
expressly affirmed or expressly denied manifestly 
obtains in the subsumption a wholly different signi 
ficance from what it bore when only enounced as a 
condition of reality or unreality and in like manner 
that notion which the subsumption left untouched 
and concerning whose existence or nonexistence the 
conclusion decides obtains a character altogether dif 
ferent in the end from what it presented in the 
beginning and thus in strict propriety there are 
found only three capital notions in an hypothetical 
syllogism — viz l“ the notion of the reciprocal de 
pendence of subject and predicate ° the notion of 
the reality or unreality of the antecedent and ° 

the notion of the reality or unreality of the conse 
quent” so much in explanation of the first special 
law or that regulative of the general form of the 
hypothetical syllogism 

the second law states the conditions of these two second 
premises — that the sumption in reference to its quan “ 
tity and quality is uniform being always definite that

is singular or universal and affirmative while the 
subsumption in both relations remains free 

in regard to the sumption when it is said that it is 
always definite that is singular or universal and 
affirmative this must be understood in a qualified 
sense touching the former it may indeed be said 
that quantity may be altogether thrown out of ac 
count in an hypothetical syllogism® for a reason 
being once supposed its consequent is necessarily 
affirmed without limitation and by the disjunction 
the extension or comprehension of the subject is so 
defined that the opposite determinations must to 
gether wholly exhaust it it may indeed sometimes 
appear as if what was enounced in an hypothetical 
sumption were enounced only of an indefinite num 
ber — of some and it consequently then assumes the 
form of a particular proposition for instance if 
some men are virtuous then some other men are 
vicious but here it is easily seen that such judg 
ments are of an universal or exhaustive nature in 
the proposition adduced the real antecedent is if 
some men only are virtuous — the real consequent is 
then all other men are vicious it would perhaps 
have been better had the relative totality of the major 
proposition of an hypothetical syllogism been ex 
pressed by another term than universal p for the 
same reason it is that the difference of extensive and 
comprehensive quantity determines no external change 
in the expression of an hypothetical syllogism for 
every hypothetical syllogism remains the same whether 
we read it in the one quantity or in the other

 regard to the other statement of the rule — that lect 

 xviii 

the sumption of an hypothetical syllogism must be i 

always affirmative — this likewise demands a word of is 
illustration it is true that the antecedent or the con 
sequent of such a sumption may be negative as well 
as affirmative for example if caius be not virtuous 
he is not entitled to respect if the sun be not risen 
it is not day but here the proposition as an hypo 
thetical judgment is and must be affirmative for 
the affirmative in such a judgment is contained in the 
positive assertion of the dependence of consequent or 
antecedent and if such a dependence be not affirmed 
an hypothetical judgment cannot exist 

in regard to what is stated in the rule concerning the ui 
the conditions of the subsumption — that this may umpllon 
either be general or particular affirmative or nega 
tive — it will not be requisite to say anything in illus 
tration for as the subsumption is merely an abso 
lute assertion of a single member of the sumption and 
as such member may as an isolated proposition be of 
any quantity or any quality it follows that the sub 
sumption is equally unlimited 

in reference to the third rule which states that the third rule 
conclusion is regulated in quantity and quality by 
that member of the sumption which is not subsumed 
and this in niodo ponente by congruence in modo 
tollente by opposition it will not be requisite to say 
much 

“ in the conclusion the latter clause of the sump 
tion is affirmed in modo ponente because the former 
is affirmed in the subsumption in this case the con 
clusion has the same quantity and quality as the 
clause which it affirms in modo tollente the ante 
cedent of the sumption is denied in the conclusion 


 


lectures on logic 


lect because in the subsumption the consequent clause had 
xvm 

 been denied there thus emerges an opposition be 
tween that clause as denied in the conclusion and 
that clause as affirmed in the sumption the conclu 
sion is thus always opposed to the antecedent of the 
sumption in quantity or in quality or in both together 
according as this is differently determined by the differ 
ent constitution of the propositions for example — 

if some men were omniscient then would they he as gods 

but no man is a god 

therefore some men are not omniscient that is no man is 
omniscient 

 hvpotho i now proceed to the consideration of the last class 
active or of syllogisms afforded by the internal form — the class 
syllogisms of dilemmatic or hypotheticodisjunctive syllogisms 
and i comprise a general enunciation of their nature 
in the following paragraph 

lxvii if the sumption of a syllogism be at 
once hypothetical and disjunctive and if in the 
subsumption the whole disjunction as a conse 
quent be sublated in order to sublate the ante 
cedent in the conclusion — such a reasoning is 
called an hypotheticodisjunctive syllogism or a 
dilemma the form of this syllogism is the 
following — 

if a exist then either b or c exists 

but neither b nor c exists 

therefore a does not exist

be combined with a disjunctive judgment and if a lect 

proposition of such a character be placed at the head l 

of a reasoning we have the hypotheticodisjunctive 
syllogism or dilemma this reasoning is properly an 
hypothetical syllogism in which the relation of the 
antecedent to the consequent is not absolutely affirm 
ed but affirmed through opposite and reciprocally ex 
clusive predicates if a exist then either b or c 
exist the sumption is thus at once hypothetical 
and disjunctive the subsumption then denies the 
disjimctive members contained in the consequent or 
posterior clause of the sumption but neither b nor 
c exist and then the inference is drawn in the con 
clusion that the reason given in the antecedent or 
prior clause of the sumption must likewise be denied 
therefore a does not exist ° for example — 

if man be not a morally responsible being he mist want either the 
power of recognising moral good as an intelligent agent or 
the power of willing it as a free agent 

but man wants neither the power of recognising moral good as an 
intelligent nor the power of willing it as a free agent 

therefore man is a morally responsible being

form of reasoning in regard to the application of

the consequent are opposed like horns to the assertion 
of the adversary with these we throw it from one 
side to the other in the subsumption in order to toss 
it altogether away in the conclusion if the disjunc 
tion has only two members the syllogism is then 
called a dilemma bicornis in the strict and proper 
signification literally double sumption of this the 
example previously given is an instance if it has 
three four or five members it is called trilemma tri 
cornis tetralemma quadricorim pentalemma quin 
quecomis if more than four it is however usually 
called polylemma multicornis but in the looser 
signification of the word dilemma is a generic ex 
pression for all or any of these” “ 

“ considered in itself the hypotheticodisjunctive 
syllogism is not to be rejected for in this form of 
reasoning we can conclude with cogency provided we 
attend to the laws already given in regard to the 
hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms it is not 
however to be denied that this kind of syllogism is 
very easily abused for the purpose of deceiving 
through a treacherous appearance of solidity and 
from terrifying a timorous adversary by its homed 
aspect in the sifting of a proposed dilemma we 
ought therefore to look closely at the three following 
particulars — ° whether a veritable consequence 
subsists between the antecedent and consequent of the 
sumption ° whether the opposition in the conse 
quent is thoroughgoing and valid and ° whether 
in the subsumption the disjunctive members are legi 
timately sublated for the example of a dilemma 
which violates these conditions take the following —

if virtue were a habit worth acquiring it must insure either lect 
potcer or wealth or honour or pleasure 

but virtue insures none of these 

therefore virtue is not a habit worth attaining 

“ here — ° the inference in general is invalid for 
a thing may be worth acquiring though it does not 
secure any of those advantages enumerated ° the 
disjunction is incomplete for there are other goods 
which virtue insures though it may not insure those 
here opposed ° the subsumption is also vicious 
for virtue has frequently obtained for its possessors 
the very advantages here denied” 

before leaving this subject it may be proper toj 
make two observations the first of these is that 

 identity 

though it has been stated that categorical syllogisms 
are governed by the laws of identity and contradic 
tion that disjunctive syllogisms are governed by the“j n 
law of excluded middle and that hypothetical syllo ” ™

° j of syllogism 

quent — this statement is not however to be under 
stood as if in these several classes of syllogism no 
other law were to be found in operation except that 
by which their peculiar form is determined such a 
supposition would be altogether erroneous for in all 
of these different kinds of syllogism besides the law 
by which each class is principally regulated and from 
which it obtains its distinctive character all the others 
contribute though in a less obtrusive manner to allow 
and to necessitate the process thus though the laws thisjiiu 
of identity and contradiction are the laws which per i in ctc 
manently regulate the categorical syllogism — still 
without the laws of excluded middle and reason and 
consequent all inference in these syllogisms would be

lect impossible thus though the law of identity affords 
 xvil the basis of all affirmative and the law of contradic 
tion the basis of all negative syllogisms still it is the 
law of excluded middle which legitimates the impli 
cation that besides affirmation and negation there 
is no other possible quality of predication in like 
manner no inference in categorical reasoning could 
be drawn were we to exclude the determination of 
reason and consequent for we only in deductive 
reasoning conclude of a part what we assume of a 
whole inasmuch as we think the whole as the reason 
— the condition — the antecedent — by which the part 
as a consequent is determined and we only in induc 
tive reasoning conclude of the whole what we assume 
of all the parts inasmuch as we think all the parts as 
the reason — the condition — the antecedent — by which 
the law of the whole as a consequent is determined in point 
mahy l ho° r of fact logically or formally the law of identity and 
that of rea the law of reason and consequent in its affirmative 
consequent form are at bottom the same the law of identity 
constitutes only the law of reason and consequent — 
the two relatives being conceived simultaneously that 
is as subject and predicate the law of reason and 
consequent constitutes only the law of identity the 
two relatives being conceived in sequence that is as 
antecedent and consequent® and as the law of 
reason and consequent in its positive form is only 
that of identity in movement so in its negative 
form it is only that of contradiction in movement 

 in din in disjunctive syllogisms again though the law of 
j syiiomb excluded middle be the principle which bestows on 
them their peculiar form still these syllogisms are not

independent of the laws of identity of contradiction lect 

and of reason and consequent the law of excluded 

middle cannot be conceived apart from the laws 
of identity and contradiction these it implies and 
without the principle of reason and consequent no 
movement from the condition to the conditioned that 
is from the affirmation or negation of one contradic 
tory to the affirmation or negation of the other would 
be possible 

finally in hypothetical syllogisms though the law s in hyj 
of reason and consequent be the prominent and dis 
tinctive principle still the laws of identity contra 
diction and excluded middle are also there at work 

the law of identity affords the condition of affirma 
tive or constructive and the law of contradiction of 
negative or destructive hypothetical while the law 
of excluded middle limits the reasoning to these two 
modes alone 

the second observation i have to make is one sug difficult in 
gested by a difficulty which has been proposed to me jhwi oe 
in regard to the doctrine that all reasoning is either ‘lniug 
from whole to part or from the parts to the whole the f th „ i e 
difficulty which could only have presented itself to 
an acute and observant intellect it gave me much 
satisfaction to hear proposed and i shall have still obv tod 
greater gratification if i should be able to remove it 
by showing in what sense the doctrine advanced is to 
be understood it was to this effect — in categorical 
syllogisms deductive and inductive intensive and 
extensive the reasoning is manifestly from whole to 
part or from the parts to the whole and therefore 
in regard to the doctrine in question as relative to 
categorical reasoning there was no difficulty but 
this was not the case in regard to hypothetical syllo

lfct gisms these are governed by the law of reason and 
 consequent and it does not appear how the antece 
dent and consequent stand to each other in the rela 
tion of whole and part 

this aim in showing how the reason and the consequent are 
moral with to be viewed as whole and part it is necessary first to 
nmthrti repeat that the reason or antecedent means the condi

gisma tion that is the complement of all without which 

ami cotwe something else would not be and the consequent 
means the conditioned that is the complement of all 
that is determined to be by the existence of something 
else you must further bear in mind that we have 
nothing to do with things standing in the relation of 
reason and consequent except in so far as they are 
thought to stand in that relation it is with the ratio 
cognoscendi not with the ratio essendi that we have 
to do in logic the former is in fact alone properly 
denominated reason and consequent while the latter 
ought to be distinguished as cause and effect the 
ratio essendi or the law of cause and effect can 
indeed only be thought under the form of the ratio 
cognoscendi or of the principle of reason and conse 
quent but as the two are not convertible inasmuch 
as the one is far more extensive than the other it is 
proper to distinguish them and therefore it is to be 
recollected that logic is alone conversant with the 
ratio cognoscendi or the law of reason and conse 
quent as alone conversant with the form of thought 

this being understood if the reason be conceived as 
that which conditions in other words as that which 
contains the necessity of the existence of the conse

the consequent for in the first place a reason is 
only a reason if it be a sufficient reason that is if it

the existence of the consequent for if all the con j 

ditions of anything are present that thing must neces 
sarily exist since if it do not exist then some con 
dition of its existence must have been wanting that 
is there was not a sufficient reason of its existence 
which is contrary to the supposition in the second 
place if the reason the sufficient reason be conceived 
as comprising all the conditions of the existence of 
the consequent it must be conceived as comprising 
the consequent altogether for if the consequent be 
supposed to contain in it any one part not conceived 
as contained in the reason it may contain two three 
or any number of parts equally uncontained in the 
reason consequently it may be conceived as altogether 
uncontained in the reason but this is to suppose 
that it has no reason or that it is not a consequent 
which again is contrary to the hypothesis the law ti c lw of 
of reason and consequent or of the condition and the consequent 
conditioned is only in fact another expression ofwprbn 
aristotle’s law — that the whole is necessarily con jotie’tiaw 
ceived as prior to the part — totum parte prim esse whole is 
necesse est a it is however more accurate for conceived 
aristotle’s law is either inaccurate or ambiguous the part 
inaccurate for it is no more true to say that the 
whole is necessarily prior in the order of thought to cictl 
the parts than to say that the parts are necessarily 
prior in the order of thought to the whole whole 


a mctaphysic s iv aristotle 
however allows a double relation 
the whole when conceived as actu

prior to the parts for the latter only

potentially however the parts may 
be regarded as prior for the whole 


might be destroyed as a system with 
out the destruction of the parts

and parts are relatives and as such are necessarily 
coexistent in thought but while each implies the 
other and the notion of each necessitates the notion 
of the other we may it is evident view either in 
thought as the conditioning or antecedent or as the 
conditioned or consequent thus on the one hand 
we may regard the whole as the prior and determining 
notion as containing the parts and the parts as the 
posterior and determined notion as contained by the 
whole on the other hand we may regard the parts 
as the prior and determining notion as constituting 
the whole and the whole as the posterior and deter 
mined notion as constituted by the parts in the 
former case the whole is thought as the reason the 
parts are thought as the consequent in the latter the 
parts are thought as the reason the whole is thought 
as the consequent now in so far as the whole is 
thought as the reason there will be no difficulty in 
admitting that the reason is conceived as containing 
the parts but it may be asked how can the parts 
when thought as the reason be said to contain the 
whole to this the answer is easy all the parts 
contain the whole just as much as the whole contains 
all the parts objectively considered the whole does 
not contain all the parts nor do all the parts contain 
the whole for the whole and all the parts are precisely 
equivalent absolutely identical but subjectively 
considered that is as mere thoughts we may either 
think the whole by all the parts or think all the parts 

a this is substantially expressed by parts are only potentially existent

by the whole if we think all the parts by the whole 
we subordinate the notion of the parts to the notion 
of the whole that is we conceive the parts to exist as 
we conceive their existence given through the existence 
of the whole containing them if we think the whole 
by all the parts we subordinate the notion of the 
whole to the notion of the parts that is we conceive 
the whole to exist as we conceive its existence given 
through the existence of the parts which constitute it 

now in the one case we think the whole as con 
ditioning or comprising the parts in the other the 
parts as conditioning or comprising the whole in 
the former case the parts are thought to exist because 
their whole exists in the latter the whole is thought 
to exist because its parts exist in either case the aj 
prior or determining notion is thought to comprise trine to ih 
or to contain the posterior or determined to apply the difficulty 
this doctrine — on the one hand every science is true iud uly 
only as all its several rules are true in this instance 
the science is conceived as the determined notion 
that is as contained in the aggregate of its constituent 
rules on the other hand each rule of any science is 
true only as the science itself is true in this instance 
the rule is conceived as the determined notion that 
is as contained in the whole science thus every 
single syllogism obtains its logical legitimacy because 
it is a consequent of the doctrine of syllogism the 
latter is therefore the reason of each several syllogism 
and the whole science of logic is abolished if each 
several syllogism conformed to this doctrine be not 
valid on the other hand the science of logic as a 
whole is only necessary inasmuch as its complementary 
doctrines are necessary and these are only necessary 
inasmuch as their individual applications are neces

the necessity of the parts which constitute determine 
and comprehend that whole is subverted in one 
relation therefore reason and consequent are as the 
whole and a contained part in another as all the parts 
and the constituted or comprised whole but in both 
relations the reason — the determining notion is 
thought as involving in it the existence of the conse 
scquent or determined notion thus in one point of 
view the genus is the determining notion or reason 
out of which are evolved as consequents the species 
and individual in another the individual is the deter 
mining notion or reason out of which as consequents 
are evolved the species and genus® in like manner 
if we regard the subject as that in which the attri 
butes inhere — in this view the subject is the reason 
that is the whole of which the attributes are a part 
whereas if we regard the attributes as the modes 
through which alone the subject can exist in this 
view the attributes are the reason that is the whole 
of which the subject is a part in a word whatever 
we think as conditioned we think as contained by 
something else that is either as a part or as a con 
stituted whole whatever we think as conditioning 
we think either as a containing whole or as a sum of 
constituting parts what therefore the sumption of 
an hypothetical syllogism denotes is simply this —

form of reasoning by their apparent complexity su°gm 
but before touching on the varieties of syllogism relation of 
afforded by their complexity of composition it may 
be proper to premise a few words in regard to the 
relation of syllogisms to each other “ every syllogism 
may be considered as absolute and independent inas 
much as it always contains a complete and inclusive 
series of thought but a syllogism may also stand to 
other syllogisms in such a relation that along with 
these correlative syllogisms it makes up a greater or 
lesser series of thoughts all holding to each other the 
dependence of antecedent and consequent and such 
a reciprocal dependence of syllogisms becomes neces 
sary when one or other of the predicates of the prin 
cipal syllogism is destitute of complete certainty and 
when this certainty must be established through one or 
more correlative syllogisms” “ “a syllogism viewed ciae and 
as an isolated and independent whole is called a of ws 
monosyllogism monosyllogismus that is a single monoiio 
reasoning — whereas a series of correlative syllogisms r ’ m 
following each other in the reciprocal relation of 
antecedent and consequent is called a polysyllogism poiyiyiio 
 polysyllogismus that is a multiplex or composite of 
reasoning and may likewise be denominated a chain 
of reasoning series syllogistica such a chain —

such a series may however have such an order of 
dependence that either each successive syllogism is 
the reason of that which preceded or the preceding 
syllogism is the reason of that which follows in the 
former case we conclude analytically or regressively 
in the second synthetically or progressively that 
syllogism in the series which contains the reason of 
the premise of another is called a prosyllogism pro

consequent of another is called an episyttogism ejri

than two syllogisms the same syllogism may in differ

syllogism and that reasoning which contains the 
primary or highest reason is alone exclusively a pro 
syllogism as that reasoning which enounces the last 
or lowest consequent is alone exclusively an episyllo 
gism but this concatenation of syllogisms as ante 
cedents and consequents may be either manifest or 
occult according as the plurality of syllogisms may 
either be openly displayed or as it may appear only 
as a single syllogism the polysyllogism is therefore 
likewise either manifest or occult the occult poly 
syllogism with which alone we arc at present con 
cerned consists either of partly complete and partly 
abbreviated syllogisms or of syllogisms all equally 
abbreviated in the former case there emerges the 
complex syllogism called epicheirema in the latter

 lxx when on the common principle of 
all reasoning — that the part of a part is a part 
of the whole — we do not stop at the second gra 
dation or at the part of the highest part and 
conclude that part of the whole — as all b is a 
part of the ichole a ancl all c is a part of the 
part b therefore all c is also a part of the whole 
a — but proceed to some indefinitely remoter 
part as d e f g h c which on the general 
principle we connect in the conclusion with its 
remotest whole — this complex reasoning is called 
a chainsyllogism or sorites if the whole from 
which we descend be a comprehensive quantity 
the sorites is one of comprehension if it be an 
extensive quantity the sorites is one of exten 
sion the formula of the first will be — 


 e is i that is e comprehends i 

 ij is c that is d comprehends c 

 c is i that is c comprehends b 

 b is a that is b comprehends a 

therefore e is a in other words e comprehends a 

the formula of the second will be — 


 bt a that is a contains under it b 

 c is b that is b contains under it c 

 i is c that is c contains under it d 

 e is d that is d contains under it e 

therefore e is a in other words a contains under it e

several quantity as descending from whole to part 
but as we may also arguing back from part to whole 
obtain the same conclusion there is also competent in

there is thus not the smallest difficulty either in 
regard to the peculiar nature of the sorites or in re

first place it is evident that the formal inference in 
the sorites is equally necessary and equally manifest 
as in the simple syllogism for the principle — the part 
of a part is a part of the whole — is plainly not less 
applicable to the remotest than to the most proximate 
link in the subordination of whole and part in the 
second place it is evident that the sorites can be 
resolved into as many simple syllogisms as there are 
middle terms between the subject and predicate of the 
conclusion that is intermediate wholes and parts be 
tween the greatest whole and the smallest part which 
the reasoning connects thus the concrete example

this illus 
trated 


of a sorites already given is virtually composed of 
three simple syllogisms it will be enough to show 
this in one of the quantities and as the most perspi 
cuous let us take that of comprehension 

the progressive sorites in this quantity was as fol 
lows and it is needless i presume to explicate it — 

bucephalus is a horse 

a horse is a quadruped 

a quadruped is an animal 

an animal is a substance 

therefore bucephalus is a substance 

here besides the major and minor terms buce 
phalus and substance we have three middle terms — 
horse — quadruped — animal we shall conse 
quently have three simple syllogisms thus in the 
first place we obtain from the middle term horse the 
following syllogism concluding quadruped of buce 
phalus — 

l — bucephalus is a horse 

but a horse is a quadruped 

therefore bucephalus is a quadruped 

having thus established that bucephalus is a 
quadruped we employ quadruped as a middle term 
by which to connect bucephalus with animal we 
therefore make the conclusion of the previous syllo 
gism no i the sumption of the following syllogism 
no ii 

 — bucephalus is a quadruped 

but a quadruped is an animal 

therefore bucephalus is an animal 

having obtained another step we in like manner 
make animal w hich was the minor term in the pre 
ceding syllogism the middle term of the following 
and the conclusion of no ii forms the major premise 
of no iii

itt — bucephalus is an animal lect 

but an animal is a substance xtx 

therefore bucephalus is a substance 


in this last syllogism we reach a conclusion identi 
cal with that of the sorites 

in the third place it is evident that the sorites is soriu 
equally natural as the simple syllogism and as the ntrai 

 a j ° as simple 

relation is equally cogent and equally manifest be yiiogim 
tween a whole and a remote and a whole and a proxi 
mate part that it is far less prolix and consequently 
far more convenient what is omitted in a sorites is 


only the idle repetition of the same selfevident prin 
ciple and as this can without danger or inconvenience 
be adjourned until the end of a series of notions in 
the dependence of mutual subordination it is plain 
that in reference to such a series a single sorites is as 
much preferable to a number of simple syllogisms as 
a comprehensive cypher is preferable to the articulate 
enumeration of the units which it collectively repre 
sents 


before proceeding to touch on the logical history of 
this form of syllogism and to comment on the doc 
trine in regard to it maintained by all logicians i shall 
conclude what it is proper further to state concerning 
its general character 


it lxxi a sorites may be either categorical par lxxi 
or hypothetical and in both forms it is governed cwricai 
by the following laws — speaking of the com “aicj ’ 
mon or progressive sorites in which reasoning

in regard to the resolution of the hypothetical lect 
sorites into simple syllogisms it is evident that in xx 
this progressive sorites we must take the two first rctoiulion 

 of hypo 

propositions as premises and then in the conclusion ‘ hc ical

connect the antecedent of the former proposition with ‘“p ® v

the consequent of the latter thus — h 

¦ive sorites 

h if harpagon be avaricious he is intent on gain 

if intent on gain he is discontented 

therefore if harpagon he avaricious he is discontented 

we now establish this conclusion as the sumption 
of the following syllogism — 

ii — if harpagon be avaricious he is discontented 

if discontented he is unhappy 

therefore if harpagon be avaricious he is unhappy 

in like manner we go on to the next syllogism — 

hi — if harpagon be avaricious he is unhappy 

now harpagon is avaricious 

therefore he is unhappy 

in the regressive sorites we proceed in the same n regrw 
fashion only that as here the consequent of the 
second proposition is the antecedent of the first we 
reverse the consecution of these premises thus — 

i — if harpagon be intent on gain he is discontented 

if discontented he is unhappy 

therefore if harpagon be intent on gain he is unhappy 

we then take the third proposition for the sump 
tion of the next — the second syllogism and the 
conclusion of the preceding for its subsumption — 

ii — if harpagon be avaricious he is intent on gain 

if intent on gain he is unhappy 

therefore if harpagon be avaricious he is unhappy

disjunctive but it may be asked can there be no disjunctive 
sorites to this it may be answered that in the 
sense in which a categorical and hypothetical syllo 
gism is possible — viz so that a term of the preceding 
proposition should be the subject or predicate of the 
following — in this sense a disjunctive sorites is im 
possible since two opposing notions whether as con 
traries or contradictories exclude each other and can 
not therefore be combined as subject and predicate 
but when the object has been determined by two 
opposite characters the disjunct members may be 
amplified at pleasure and there follows certainly a 
correct conclusion provided that the disjunction be 
logically accurate as — 


a is either b or c 


b is either i or e 
d is either h or i 
e is either k or l 


now 

c is either f or g 
f is either m or n 
g is either or p 


therefore a is either h or i or k or l or m or n or o or p 


complex although therefore it be true that such a sorites 
viceabit r is correct still were we astricted to such a mode of 
reasoning thought would be so difficult as to be 
almost impossible but we never are obliged to 
employ such a reasoning for when we are once 
assured that a is either b or c and assured we are 
of this by one of the fundamental laws of thought 


 


lectures on logic 


 


we have next to consider whether a is b or c and lect 

if a is b then all that can be said of c and if a is — 

c then all that can be said of b is dismissed as wholly 
irrelevant in like manner in the case of b it must 
be determined whether it is d or e and in the case 
of c whether it is f or g and this being determined 
one of the two members is necessarily thrown out of 
account and this compendious method we follow in 
the process of thought spontaneously and as if by a 
natural impulsion

which obtained in latin from cicero the denomi

certain quantity of something of variable amount were 
large or small — say a certain sum of money if you 
said it was small the adversary went on gradually 
adding to it asking you at each increment whether it 
were still small till at length you said that it was 
large the last sum which you had asserted to be 
small was now compared with that which you now 
asserted to be large and you were at length forced

to be small differed from each other by the very

of the sorites — word and thing — not certainly on 
account of the importance of this history considered 
in itself but because it will enable you the better to 
apprehend what is now to be said of the illustration 
which the doctrine taught by logicians themselves 
of the nature of this particular process affords of the 
onesided view which they have all taken of the nature 
of reasoning in general 

i have already shown in regard to the simple syllo 
gism that all deductive reasoning is from whole to 
part that there are two kinds of logical whole and 
two kinds of logical part — the one in the quantity of 
comprehension the other in the quantity of extension 
— and that there are consequently two kinds of reason 
ing corresponding to these several quantities i fur 
ther showed that logicians had in simple syllogisms 
marvellously overlooked one and that the simplest 
and most natural of these descriptions of reasoning — 
the reasoning in the quantity of comprehension and 
that all their rules were exclusively relative to the 
reasoning which proceeds in the quantity of extension 
now in today’s lecture i have shown that as in 
simple syllogisms so in the complex form of the 
sorites there is equally competent a reasoning in com 
prehension and in extension — though undoubtedly 
in the one case as in the other the reasoning in com 
prehension is more natural and easy in its evolution 
than the reasoning in extension inasmuch as the 
middle term in the former is really intermediate in 
position standing between the major and the minor 
terms whereas in the latter the middle term is not 
in situation middle but occupies the position of one 
or other of the extremes 

now if in the case of simple syllogisms it be mar

vellous that logicians should have altogether over lect 

looked the possibility of a reasoning in comprehension — 

it is doubly marvellous that with this their prepos 
session they should in the case of the sorites have extcnalon 
altogether overlooked the possibility of a reasoning in 
extension but so it is a they have all followed 
each other in defining the sorites as a concatenated 
syllogism in which the predicate of the proposition 
preceding is made the subject of the proposition fol 
lowing until we arrive at the concluding proposition 
in which the predicate of the last of the premises is 
enounced of the subject of the first this definition 
applies only to the progressive sorites in comprehen 
sion and to the regressive sorites in extension but 
that they did not contemplate the latter form at all is 
certain both because it is not lightly to be presumed 
that they had in view that artificial and recondite 
form and because the examples and illustrations they 
supply positively prove that they had not 


to the progressive sorites in extension and to the different 
regressive sorites in comprehension this definition is twofomw 
inapplicable for in these the subject of the premise 
preceding is not the predicate of the premise following 

but the difference between the two forms is better 
stated thus — the progressive sorites of compre 
hension and the regressive sorites of extension the 
middle terms are the predicates of the prior premises 
and the subjects of the posterior the middle term 
is here in position intermediate between the extremes 

on the contrary in the progressive sorites of exten 
sion and in the regressive sorites of comprehension

the middle terms are the subjects of the prior pre

to the question — why in the case of simple syllo 
gisms the logicians overlooked the reasoning in com 
prehension and in the case of the sorites the reason 
ing in extension it is perhaps impossible to afford a 
satisfactory explanation but we may plausibly con 
jecture what it is out of our power certainly to prove 
in regard to simple syllogisms it was an original 
dogma of the platonic school and an early dogma of 
the peripatetic that philosophy — that science strictly 
so called — was only conversant with and was exclu 
sively contained in universals and the doctrine of 
aristotle which taught that all our general know 
ledge is only an induction from an observation of 
particulars was too easily forgotten or perverted by 
his followers it thus obtained almost the force of an 
acknowledged principle that everything to be known 
must be known under some general form or notion 
hence the exaggerated importance attributed to defi 
nition and deduction it not being considered that 
we only take out of a general notion what we had 
previously placed therein and that the amplification 
of our knowledge is not to be sought for from above 
but from below — not from speculation about abstract 
generalities but from the observation of concrete par 
ticulars but however erroneous and irrational the 
persuasion had its day and influence and it perhaps 
determined as one of its effects the total neglect of 
one half and that not the least important half of the 
reasoning process for while men thought only of 
looking upwards to the more extensive notions as the 


 


lectures on logic 


 


only objects and the only media of science they took lect 

little heed of the more comprehensive notions and — 

absolutely contemned individuals as objects which 
could neither be scientifically known in themselves 
nor supply the conditions of scientifically knowing 
aught besides the logic of comprehension and of 
induction was therefore neglected or ignored — the 
logic of extension and deduction exclusively culti 
vated as alone affording the rules by which we might 
evolve higher notions into their subordinate concepts 

this may help to explain why subsequently to aris 
totle logic was cultivated in so partial a manner but 
why subsequently to bacon the logic of comprehen 
sion should still have escaped observation and study 

i am altogether at a loss to imagine but to the and why 
question — why when reasoning in general was viewed of the son 
only as in the quantity of extension the minor form overlooked 
of the sorites should have been viewed as exclusively m r in ex 
in that of comprehension may perhaps be explained un “ n 
by the following consideration this form was not 
originally analysed and expounded by the acuteness 
of aristotle but it could not escape notice that there 
was a form of reasoning of very frequent employment 
both byphilosophers and rhetoricians in which a single 
conclusion was drawn from a multiplicity of premises 
and in which the predicate of the foregoing premise 
was usually the subject of the following cicero for 
example and seneca are full of such arguments and 
the natural and easy evolution of the reasoning is 
indeed peculiarly appropriate to demonstration thus 
to prove that every body is movable we have the 
following selfevident deduction every body is in 
space what is in space is in some one part of space 
what is in one part of space may be in another what

may be in another part of space may change its space 
what may change its space is movable therefore 
every body is movable when therefore valla or 
whoever else has the honour of first introducing the 
consideration of this form of reasoning into logic was 
struck with the cogency and clearness of this com 
pendious argumentation he did not attempt to reduce 
it to the conditions of the extensive syllogism and 
subsequent logicians when the form was once intro 
duced and recognised in their science were as usual 
content to copy one from another without subjecting 
their borrowed materials to any original or rigorous 
criticism 

ut nemo in sese tentat descendere — nemo 

sed pnecedenti spectator mantica tergoo 

accordingly not one of them has noticed that the 
sorites of their systems proceeds in a different quantity 
from that of their syllogisms in general — that their 
logic is thus at variance with itself far less did any 
of them observe that this and all other forms of 
reasoning are capable of being drawn in another 
quantity from that which they all exclusively contem 
plated and yet had they applied their observation 
without prepossession to the matter they would easily 
have seen that the sorites could be cast in the quan 
tity of extension equally as common syllogisms and 
that common syllogisms could be cast in the quantity 
of comprehension equally as the sorites i have 
already shown that the same sorites may be drawn 
either in comprehension or in extension and in both 
quantities proceed either by progression or by regres 
sion but the example given may perhaps be viewed 
as selected let us therefore take any other and

the first that occurs to my recollection is the following lect

he who is temperate is constant 

he who is constant is unperturbed 

he who is unperturbed is without sorrow 

he who is icithout sorrow is happy 

therefore the prudent man is happy 


in this sorites everything slides easily and smoothly 
from the whole to the parts of comprehension but 
though the process will be rather more by hitches the 
descent under extension will if not quite so pleasant 
be equally rapid and certain 


he who is without sorrow is happy 

he who is unperturbed is without sorrow 
he who is constant is unperturbed 

he who is temperate is constant 

he who is prudent is temperate 
therefore the prudent man is happy 


i do not think it necessary to explicate these two 
reasonings which you are fully competent i am sure 
to do without difficulty for yourselves 

what renders it still more wonderful that the logi the oocic 
cians did not evolve the competency of this process in sontm 
either quantity and thus obtain a key to the opening 
up of the whole mystery of syllogistic reasoning is 
this — that it is now above two centuries since the 
inverse or regressive sorites in comprehension was 
discovered and signalised by rodolphus goelenius a 
celebrated philosopher of marburg in which university 
he occupied the chair of logic and metaphysics

explication of the whole process and we are there

easy and manifest should not have been made before

of syllogism has been sometimes styled by logicians 
not only sorites but also coacervatio congeries gra

disposed to predicate of it extreme simplicity® in 
point of fact we might arrange the epicheirema and 
sorites with far greater propriety under elliptical 
syllogisms than as is commonly done by logicians 
under the pleonastic this last classification is 
indeed altogether erroneous for it is a great mistake 
to suppose that in either of these forms there is aught 
redundant

the conclusion 

such as it is stated in the former part of the para explication 
graph is the doctrine you will find maintained with mon doc 
singular unanimity by modern logicians and with enthymcmo 
hardly an exception this classification of syllogisms is cmraioiwiy 
stated not only without a suspicion of its own cor u arctic 
reetness but as a division established on the authority 
of the great father of logic himself in both asser 
tions they are however wrong for the classification 
itself is futile and aristotle affords it no countenance 
while at the same time if a distinction of syllogisms 
is to be taken from the ellipsis of their propositions 
the subdivision of enthymemes is not complete inas 
much as a syllogism may exist with both premises 
expressed and the conclusion understood 

i shall therefore in the first place show that the 
enthymeme as a syllogism of a defective enounce 
ment constitutes no special form of reasoning in the 
second that aristotle does not consider a syllogism of 
such a character as such a special form and in the 
third that admitting the validity of the distinction 
the restriction of the enthymeme to a syllogism of 
one suppressed premise cannot be competently main 
tained 

“i in regard then to the validity of the distinction l the e b 
this is disproved on the following grounds first of not a ppo

syllogism would involve a discrimination of the rea

lectures on logic 


lect for in general reasoning we rarely express all the 

 propositions of a syllogism and it is almost only in 

the treatises on abstract logic that we find examples 
of reasoning in which all the members are explicitly 
enounced but logic does not create new forms of 
syllogism it merely expounds those which are already 
given and while it shows that in all reasoning there 
are in the mental process necessarily three judgments 
the mere nonexpression of any of these in language 
no more constitutes in logic a particular kind of syl 
logism than does the ellipsis of a term constitute in 
grammar a particular kind of concord or government 
but secondly syllogism and enthymeme are not dis 
tinguished as respectively an intralogical and an extra 
logical form both are supposed equally logical 
those who defend the distinction are therefore neces 
sarily compelled to maintain that logic regards the 
accident of the external expression and not the essence 
of the internal thought in holding that the enthy 
meme is really a defective reasoning® 

it thus appears that to constitute the enthymeme 
as a species of reasoning distinct from syllogisms 
proper by the difference of perfect and imperfect is 
of all absurdities the greatest — but is this absurd 
ity the work of aristotle — and this leads us to the 
second head 

ii the di ii without entering upon a regular examination 
the enthv of the various passages of the aristotelic treatises rela 
 rpeeiai tive to this point i may observe in the first place 
reasoning that aristotle expressly declares in general that a 
arisloiie by syllogism is considered by the logician not in rela 
tion to its expression ov rpo top efo yov but

exclusively as a mental process axxa npbs rov ev rfj lfct 
bxu xdyov“ the distinction therefore of a class of xx 
syllogisms as founded on a verbal accident he thus of 
course implicitly and by anticipation condemns but 
aristotle in the second place does distinguish the the enthy 
enthymeme as a certain kind of syllogism — as a syl “stl— 
logism of a peculiar matter — as a syllogism from signs 
and likelihoods now if having done this it were 
held that aristotle over and above distinguished the 
enthymeme also as a syllogism with one suppressed 
premise aristotle must be supposed to define the 
enthymeme by two differences and by two differences 
which have no mutual analogy for a syllogism from 
signs and likelihoods does not more naturally fall into 
an elliptical form than a syllogism of any other matter 

yet this absurdity has been and is almost universally 
believed of the acutest of human intellects and on 
grounds which when examined afford not the slight 
est warrant for such a conclusion on the criticism 
of these grounds it would be out of place here to 
enter suffice it to say that the texts in the organon 
and rhetoric which may be adduced in support of the 
vulgar opinion will bear no such interpretation — 
that in one passage where the word arexs imper 
fect is applied to the enthymeme — this word if 
genuine need signify only that the reasoning from 
signs and probabilities affords not a perfect or neces 
sary inference but that in point of fact the word 
arexs is there a manifest interpolation made to 
accommodate the aristotelic to the common doctrine 
of the enthymeme for it is not extant in the oldest 
manuscripts and has accordingly without any refer

among the ancients who employed the term for a 
syllogism with some suppressed part a considerable 
number held with our modern logicians that it was a 
syllogism deficient of one or other premise as alexan 
der the aphrodisian ammonius hermiae philoponus“ 
c some however as pachymeres only recognised 
the absence of the major premise some on the con 
trary thought like quintilian that the suppressed 
proposition ought to be the conclusion — nay ulpian 
the greek commentator of demosthenes and the 
scholiast on hermogenes the rhetorician absolutely 
define an enthymeme — “ a syllogism in which the 
conclusion is unexpressed” 

iii this leads us to the third head for on no 
principle can it be shown that our modern logicians 
are correct in denying or not contemplating the possi 
bility of the reticence of the conclusion the only 
principle on which a syllogism is competent with one 
or other of its propositions unexpressed is this — that 
the part suppressed is too manifest to require enounce 
ment on this principle a syllogism is not less pos 
sible with the conclusion than with either of the pre 
mises understood and in point of fact occurs quite 
as frequently as any other the logicians therefore

but give you a latin and english imitation which 
will serve equally well to illustrate the point in ques

rabelais and others have also satirised it runs as i 
recollect thus — 

“ sunt monachi nequam nequam non onns et alter 

prater petrum omnes est sed et hie monachus 

the english imitation was written hy porson upon 
gottfried hermann when this was written con 
fessedly the prince of greek scholars who when 
hardly twenty had attacked porson’s famous canons 
in his work de metris grcecorum et romanorum 
the merit of the epigram does not certainly lie in its 
truth 

“ the germans in greek 

are sadly to seek 

not five in five score 

but ninetyfive more 

all save only hermann 

and hermann’s a german”

is suppressed yet its illative force is felt even in spite

whole point and elegance of the epigram to put 
the former into a syllogistic shape —

for an admission by the philosopher himself that the 
doctrine of the absolute transcends human compre 
hension 

what has now been said may suffice to show not 
only that we may have entkymemes with any of the 
three propositions understood but that the distinction 
itself of the enthymeme as a species of syllogism is 
inept

under the head of their external or accidental form 
— i mean the division of syllogisms into regular and

h lxxiii a syllogism is irregular by rela jkct 
tion — ° to the transposed order of its proposi — — — 
tions ° to the transposed order of its terms kinds of 
and ° to the transposed order of both its pro 
positions and terms of these in their order 

° a syllogism in extension is regular in the 
order of its propositions when the subsumption 
follows the sumption and the conclusion follows 
the subsumption in this respect discounting 
the difference of the quantities of depth and 
breadth it therefore admits of a fivefold irre 
gularity under three heads — for either ° the 
two premises may be transposed or ° the 
conclusion may precede the premises and here 
either the sumption or the subsumption may stand 
first or ° the conclusion may be placed be 
tween the premises and here either the sumption 
or the subsumption may stand first thus re 
presenting the sumption subsumption and con 
clusion by the letters a b c we have besides 
the regular order ° b a c — ° c a b — ° 

c b a — ° a c b— ° b c a this doc 
trine of the logicians is however onesided and 
erroneous 

° a syllogism is regular or irregular in re 
spect to the order of its terms according to the 
place which the middle term holds in the pre 
mises it is regular in comprehensive quantity 
when the middle term is the predicate of the 
sumption and the subject of the subsumption — 

in extensive quantity when the middle term is 
the subject of the sumption and the predicate 
of the subsumption from the regular order of 
the terms there are three possible deviations in

sumption be predicate and in the subsumption

middle term and the letters s and p to designate 
the subject and predicate of the conclusion the

of these two kinds of irregularity in the exter 
nal form of syllogisms the former — that of proposi 
tions — is of far less importance than the latter — that 
of terms and logicians have even thrown it altogether 
out of account in their consideration of syllogistic 
figure they are however equally wrong in passing 
over the irregular consecution of the propositions of a 
syllogism as a matter of absolutely no moment and 
in attributing an exaggerated importance to every 
variety in the arrangement of its terms they ought 
at least to have made the student of logic aware that 
a syllogism can be perspicuously expressed not only 
by the normal but by any of the five consecutions of 
its propositions which deviate from the regular order 
for example take the following syllogism —

this is the regular succession of sumption sub 
sumption and conclusion in a syllogism of extension 
and as all that can be said on the present question 
of the one quantity is applicable mutatis mutandis 
to the other it will be needless to show articulately 
that a syllogism in comprehension is equally suscep

sobriety is a virtue

for all virtue is praiseworthy 

and sobriety is a virtue 


now let the premises be transposed c b a 

sobriety is pro isoworth y 

for sobriety is a virtue 

and all virtue is praiseworthy 


the regressive reasoning in both these cases is not 
less manifest than the progressive reasoning of the 
regular order 

in the last place let us interpolate the conclusion 
between the premises in their normal consecution 
a c b 


all virtue is praiseworthy

for sobriety is a virtue 


secondly between the premises in their reversed 
order b c a

in these two cases the reasoning is not obscure 
though perhaps the expression be inelegant for the 
judgment placed after the conclusion had probably 
been already supplied in thought on the enunciation 
of the conclusion and therefore when subsequently 
expressed it is felt as superfluous but this is a cir 
cumstance of no logical importance 

it is thus manifest that though worthy of notice 
in a system of logic the transposition of the proposi 
tions of a syllogism affords no modifications of form 
yielding more than a superficial character logicians 
therefore were not wrong in excluding the order of 
the propositions as a ground on which to constitute 
a difference of syllogistic form but we shall see that 
they have not been consistent or not sufficiently sharp 
sighted in this exclusion for several of their recog 
nised varieties of form — several of the moods of syllo 
gistic figure — consist in nothing but a reversal of the 
premises 

in reality however there is no irregular order of true i 
the syllogistic propositions except in the single consecution 
case where the conclusion is placed between the 
premises for a syllogism may be either called syllogism 
synthetic in which case the premises come first and tlictic or 
the conclusion is last — the case alone contemplated al ‘ dta 
by the logicians or it may be called analytic the 
proposition styled the conclusion preceding the pro 
positions called the premises following as its reasons

analytic and synthetic syllogisms may again be each 
considered as in the quantity of extension or as in 
the quantity of comprehension in which cases we 
shall have a counterorder of the premises but of 
which orders as indeed of such quantities one alone 
has been considered by the logicians 

i now therefore go on to the second and more 
important ground of regularity and irregularity — the 
natural and transposed order of the syllogistic terms 
the forms determined by the different position of the 
middle term by relation to the major and minor terms 
in the premises of a syllogism are called figures 
fiara figures — a name given to them by aristotle® 
of these the first is on the prevalent doctrine not 
properly a figure at all if by figure be meant in logic 
as in grammar and khetoric a deviation from the 
natural and regular form of expression of these 
figures the first three were distinguished by aristotle 
who developed their rules with a tedious minuteness 
sometimes obscure and not always in the best order 
but altogether with an acuteness which if ever equalled 
has certainly never been surpassed the fourth which 
whately — at least in the former editions of his ele 
ments — and other recent oxford logicians seem to 
suppose to be like the others of aristotelic origin — 
we owe perhaps to the ingenuity of galen i say 
perhajis for though in logical treatises attributed 
without hesitation to the great physician as if a 
doctrine to be found in his works this is altogether 
erroneous there is i am certain no mention of the 
fourth figure in any writing of galen now extant and 

a anal prior i — ed cf pacius comment pp 


 


lectures on logic 


 


no mention of galen’s addition of that figure by lect 
any greek or latin authority of an age approximat ‘ 
ing to his own the first notice of this galenic criuo 
figure is by the spanish arabian averroes of cor a s cm y 
dova in his commentary on the organon “ aver 
roes flourished above a thousand yearn posterior to 
galen and from his report alone as i have also 
ascertained does the prevalent opinion take its rise 
that we owe to galen this amplification or corruption 
as it may be of the aristotelic doctrines of logical 
figure there has been lately published from manu 
script by didot of paris a new logical treatise of 
galen in this work in which the syllogistic figures 
are detailed there is no mention of a fourth figure 

galen therefore as far as we know affords no excep 
tion to the other authors upon logic in these circum 
stances it is needless to observe how slender is the 
testimony in favour of the report and this is one of 
many others in which an idle story once told and 
retailed obtains universal credit as an established fact 
in consequence of the prevalent ignorance of the 
futility of its foundation of the legitimacy of the 
fourth figure i shall speak after having shown you 
the nature of its reasoning 

before proceeding further in the consideration of complex 
the figure of syllogism it is however necessary to sthe 
state a complex modification to which it is subject syfktfnn 
and which is contained in the following paragraph

tions which constitute the reasoning as the 
combination of quantity and quality affords 
four kinds of propositions — universal affirma 
tive a universal negative e particular 
affirmative i particular negative and 
as there are three propositions in each syllogism 
there are consequently in all sixtyfour arrange 
ments possible of three propositions differing in 
quantity and quality — arrangements which con 
stitute what are called the syllogistic moods 
rponol modi i may interpolate the observa 
tion the greek logicians after aristotle looking 
merely to the two premises in combination called 
these syzygies y avvyiat jiigauones y conjugatio 
nesy combinationes aristotle himself never uses 
tporo for either mood or modality specially 
nor does he use rvvyca in any definite sense 
his only word for mood is the vague expression 
syllogism 

the greater number of these moods are how 
ever incompetent as cont radictory of the general 
rules of syllogism and there are in all only 
eleven which can possibly enter a legitimate 
syllogism these eleven mopds again are for the 
same reason not all admissible in every figure 
but six only in each that is in all twentyfour 
and again of these twentyfour five are useless 
and therefore usually neglected as having a 
particular conclusion where a universal is compe 
tent the nineteen useful moods admitted by 
logicians may however by the quantification of 
the predicate be still further simplified by super 
seding the significance of figure

moods of the syllogistic figures it is necessary that ’ — 

you recall to memory the three laws i gave you of the km k ““ ‘ 
categorical syllogism and in particular the two clauses 
of the second law — that the sumption must be defi 
nite general or singular and the subsumption affir 
mative — clauses which are more vaguely expressed 
by the two laws of the logicians — that no conclusion 
can be drawn from two particular premises — and 
that no conclusion can be drawn from two negative 
premises this being premised you recollect that 
the four combinations of quantity and quality com 
petent to a proposition were designated by the four 
letters a e i — a denoting a universal affirma 
tive — e a universal negative — i a particular affir 
mative — a particular negative

now the question arises — are all of these sixteen

towards a legitimate conclusion in answer to this 
it is evident that a considerable number of these are 
at once invalidated by the first clause of the second 
law of the categorical syllogism in so far as recog 
nised by logicians by which all moods with two par 
ticular premises are excluded as in these there is no 
general rule of this class are the four moods i i 
i i and and the second clause of the 
same law in so far as recognised by logicians in 
validates the moods of two negative premises as in 
these there is no subordination of this class are the 
four moods ee e e and finally by 
the two clauses of the second rule in conjunction the 
mood i e is said to be excluded because the particu 
lar sumption contains no general rule and the nega 
tive subsumption no subordination this i think is 
incorrect these exclusions have been admitted to 
be valid for every figure there consequently remain 
say the logicians as the possible modes of any legi 
timate syllogism the eight following — a a a e a i

to you the common doctrine of the logicians show to 
be really no exceptions 

but whether each of the moods though a priori 
possible affords a proper syllogism in all the figures 
— this depends on the definite relations of the middle 
term to the two others in the several figures these 
therefore require a closer investigation i shall con 
sider them with the logicians principally in the 
quantity of extension but mutatis mutandis all that 
is true in the one quantity is equally true in the other 

now if in the first figure we consider these eight 
moods with reference to the general rules we shall find 
that all do not in this figure afford correct syllogisms 
but only those which are constructed in conformity to 
the following particular rules which are however in 
this figure identical with those we have already given 
as general laws of eveiy perfect and regular categori 
cal syllogism

“ the second rule is — the subsumption must be 
affirmative were it negative and consequently the 
sumption affirmative in that case s would be wholly 
excluded from the sphere of m and consequently 
the general rule under which m stands would not be 
applicable to s thus — 

all m are p

no s in p

no sound is a colour 

therefore no sound is a physical pluenomenon 

“ here the negative conclusion is false but the affir

and therefore no inference is competent at all” p 

thus in this figure of the eight moods generally

syllogisms — their divisions according to 
external form 

figure — third and fourth 

in out last lecture after terminating the general 
consideration of the nature of figure and mood in 
categorical syllogisms we were engaged in a rapid 
survey of the nineteen legitimate and useful moods 
belonging to the four figures according to the received 
doctrine of logicians consequently exclusively in ex 
tension and i had displayed to you the laws and 
moods of the first and second figures before there 
fore proceeding to any criticism of this doctrine it 
behoves us to terminate the view of the two remain 
ing figures 

to each of the first two figures logicians attribute 
four moods to the third they concede six and to 
the fourth five the scheme of the third figure in 
extension is — 

m p 

m s 

this figure always in extension is governed by 


 


lectures on logic 


 


the two following laws — the first is “ the subsump 
tion must be affirmative® were the minor premise 
a negative as in the syllogism — 

all m are p all fiddles are musical instruments 

or 

no m is s ’ but no fiddle is a flute 

here the conclusion would be ridiculous — therefore 
no s is p — therefore no flute is a musical instru 
ment for m and s can both exclude each other 
and yet both lie within the sphere of p 

“ the second law is — the conclusion must be par 
ticular and particular although both premises are 
universal this may be shown both in affirmative 
and negative syllogisms in the case of affirmative 
syllogisms as — 

all m are p 

but all m are s 

here you will observe m lies in two different 
spheres — p and s and these must in the conclusion 
be connected in a relation of subordination but s 
and p may be disparate notions and consequently 
not to be so connected an absurd conclusion would 
therefore be the result for example — 

all birds are animals with feathers 

but all birds are animals with a heart 

therefore all animals with a heart are animals 
with feathers 

“ again” say the logicians “ in regard to negatives 
— in these only the sumption can be negative as

— tive thus — 


no m is p no silver is iron 

or 

but all m arc s but all silver is a mineral 


“ here the conclusion — no s is p — no mineicil is 
iron would be false 

“ testing the eight possible moods in extension by 
these special rules there remain for this figure six 
which by the latin logicians have been named dar 
apti felapton disamis dalisi bocardo ferison — 
the first mood of this figure is — 


i dnrapti 



t — paraptio 

all m are p 

but all m arc s 

therefore some s are p 
or 

all gilding is metallic 

all gilding shines 

therefore some things that shine are 
metallic 


“ here it is manifest that m cannot at once lie in 
two different spheres unless these partially involve — 
partially intersect each other but only partially 
for as both p and s are more extensive than m and 
are both only connected through m i e through a 
part of themselves they cannot except partially be 
identified with each other

“ you will observe that according to this diagram 
the conclusion ought to be — no s is p because the 
whole of s lies out of the sphere of p and as in the 
concrete example the notion extended is viewed as 
out of the notion moral subject w r e might conclude — 
nothing extended is a moral subject but this con 
clusion though materially correct cannot however 
be formally inferred from the premises in the sump 
tion indeed the whole of m is excluded from the 
sphere of p but in the subsumption m is included 
in the sphere s that is we think that the notion m 
is a part of the notion s now in the conclusion s 
is brought under p and the conclusion of a categori 
cal syllogism in reference to its quantity is as you 
remember by the third general law regulated by the 
quality of the subsumption but as in the present 
case the subsumption notwithstanding the univer 
sality of the expression only judges of a part of s

the conclusion can in like manner only judge of a 
part of s of the other parts of s there is nothing 
enounced in the premises the relation between s 
and p could likewise be as follows — 

no m is p 

but nil m are s 
or 

no pigeon is a hawk 

but all jug eons are birds 



“ here the conclusion could not be a universal nega 
tive — therefore no s is p — therefore no bird is a 
hawk — for the sphere of s bird is greater than that 
of either m pigeon or p hawk it may however 
be a particular negative — therefore some s are not p 
 therefore some birds are not hawks — because the 
sumption has excluded m and p pigeon and hand 
from each other’s sphere and consequently the part 
of s which is equal to m is different from the part of s 
which is equal to p — but if this be the case when the 
subsumption has an universal expression the same a 
fortioii is true when it is particular

but some m are s 

in this case m may or may not be a notion superior 
to p 

“ on the former alternative if m be higher than p 
and likewise higher than s then the whole of s might 
be contained under p — in this case the proper eon 


a biiclinmnd loffil § p — eu

elusion would be a universal affirmative which how 
ever cannot follow from the premises as the subsump 
tion ex hypothesi is particular on the latter alter 
native even if m were not superior to s still since p 
is only a part of m we could not know whether a 
part of s were contained under p or not for ex 
ample — 

all men are animals 

but gome animals are amphibious 

“ from these premises no conclusion could be drawn 

“ ii the second rale by which this figure is governed 
is — if either premise be negative the sumption must 
be universal 

suppose we had the premises — 

some p are not m 

but all m are 

therefore some are not p 

or 

some animals are not feathered 

but all feathered animals are birds 

therefore some birds are not animals 

“ in this case the whole of s lies within the sphere 
of p there cannot therefore follow a particular 
negative conclusion and if not that no conclusion 
at all the same would happen were the sumption a 
particular affirmative and the subsumption a univer 
sal negative 

“ iii the third rule of the fourth figure is — if the 
subsumption be affirmative the conclusion must be 
particular this the logicians say is manifest for 
in this figure s is higher than m and higher than p 
consequently only a part of s can be p 

“ if we test by these rales the eight possible moods 
there are in this figure five found competent which

as the other parts of s are not taken into account we 
are consequently not entitled to deny these of p 
the first diagram therefore which sensualises only a 
single case is not coadequate with the logical formula

mood since the subsumption only places a part of

is determined by the subsumption can only deny p of 
that part of s which is likewise a part of m” ° 

having thus concluded the exposition of the various 
figures and moods of syllogisms as recognised by 
logicians in reference to extensive quantity it will 
not be necessary to say more than a word in general 
touching these figures and moods in reference to com 
prehensive quantity whatever mood and figure is 
valid and regular in the one is valid and regular in 
the other and every anomaly is equally an anomaly 
in both the rules of the various figures which we 
have considered in regard to syllogisms in extension 
are all without exception or qualification applicable 
to syllogisms in comprehension with this single pro 
viso that as the same proposition forms a different 
premise in the several quantities all that is said of the 
sumption in extension should be understood of the 
subsumption in comprehension and all that is said of 
the sumption in comprehension should be understood

of the subsumption in extension what therefore lect 

has hitherto been or may hereafter be stated of the — 

mood and figure of one quantity is to be viewed as 
applicable mutatis mutandis to the other this being 
understood i proceed in the first place to show you criticism of 
that the complex series of logical forms which i have in doctrino 
enumerated may x considerably diminished and the fon l 
doctrine of syllogism consequently reduced to a higher 
simplicity in doing this i shall consider first the 
figures and secondly their moods 

now as regards the number of the figures you are i the

only contemplated the three first and that the fourth the fourth 
which is by those who do not mistake it for an aris 
totelic form referred with little probability to galen 
was wholly unnoticed until the end of the twelfth or 
the beginning of the thirteenth century when it was 
incidentally communicated as an innovation of the 
physician of pergamus by the celebrated averroes in 
his commentary on the prior analytics of aristotle 
but by averroes himself rejected as an illegitimate 
novelty® the notice of this figure by the commen 
tator was how t ever enough and though repudiated 
by the great majority of the rigid aristotelians the 
authority of scotus by whom it was defended secured 
for it at last if not an universal approval at least a 
very general toleration as a legitimate though an

awkward form the arguments indeed by which it 
was attempted to evince the incompetency of this 
figure were not of a character calculated to enforce 
assent for its inference is not less valid than that of 
any other — however tortuous and perverse it may be 
felt to be in fact the logicians in consequence of 
their exclusive recognition of the reasoning in exten 


grotrads on 
which the 
fourth 


sion were not in possession of the means of showing 
that this figure is a monster undeserving of toleration 
far less of countenance and favour i shall not there 
fore trouble you with the inconclusive reasoning on 
the part either of those who have assailed or of those 
who have defended this figure but shall at once put 
you in possession of the ground on which alone i 
think its claim to recognition ought to be disallowed 

in the first place then you are aware that all 
reasoning is either in the quantity of comprehension 
ought to bo or in the quantity of extension you are aware in 
the second that these quantities are not only different 
but as existing in an inverse ratio of each other 
opposed finally in the third place you are aware 
that though opposed so that the maximum of the 
one is the minimum of the other yet the existence of 
each supposes the existence of the other accordingly 
there can be no extension without some comprehen 
sion — no comprehension without some extension 
a cross this being the case it is evident that besides the 
jraaible definite reasoning from whole to part and from parts 

sion to com to whole within the several quantities and in their

perpendicular lines there is also competent an indefi lect 
nite inference across from the one quantity to the — — — 
other for if the existence of the one quantity be ssd’tst 
only possible under the condition of the other we may urm ’ 
always it is selfevident in the first place from the 
affirmation of anything in extension indefinitely affirm 
it in comprehension as reciprocally from the affirma 
tion of anything in comprehension we may indefinitely 
affirm it in extension and in the second place from 
the negation of anything in extension we may abso 
lutely deny it in comprehension as reciprocally from 
the negation of anything in comprehension we may 
absolutely deny it in extension 

now what has not been observed such is exclu tin the 
sively the inference in the fourth figure its two last rnftceiu 
rules are in fact nothing but an enunciation of those figure 
two conditions of a cross inference from the one 
quantity to the other and the first rule will be 
hereafter shown to be only an error the result of not 
observing that certain moods are only founded on the 
accident of a trausposed order of the premises and 
therefore constitute no subject for a logical legisla 
tion 

to prove this statement of the nature of the infer ivvei 

 illustrated 

ence in the fourth figure it is only necessary to look 
at its abstract formula in extension this is — 

p w m 

mws 

 is p 

here in the premises p is contained under m and 
m is contained under s that is in the premises s is 
the greatest whole and p the smallest part so far 


 


 


lectukes on logic

this syllogism in extension is properly a syllogism in 
comprehension in which the subject of the conclusion 
is the greatest whole and its predicate the smallest 
part from such premises we therefore expect that 
the conclusion carrying out what was established in 
the antecedent should affirm p as the part of s — in 
this however our expectation is disappointed for 
the reasoning suddenly turns round in the conclusion 
and affirms s as a part of p and how it may be 
asked is this evolution in the conclusion competent 
seeing that it was not prepared and no warrant given 
for it in the premises to this the answer is prompt 
and easy the conclusion in this figure is solely legi 
timated by the circumstance that from an identity 
between the two terms in one quantity we may 
always infer some identity between them in the other 
and from a nonidentity between them in one quantity 
we can always infer a nonidentity in the other and 
that in this figure there is always a transition in the 
conclusion from the one quantity is evident for that 
notion which in the premises was the greatest whole 
becomes in the conclusion the smallest part and that 
notion which in the premises was the smallest part 
becomes in the conclusion the greatest whole now 
how is this manoeuvre possible — how are we entitled 
to say that because a contains all b therefore b con 
tains some a only it is clear because there is here 
a change from the containing of the one quantity to 
the containing of the other and because each quantity 
necessarily implying the indefinite existence of the 
other we are consequently permitted to render this 
necessary implication the ground of a logical infer 
ence 


 


lectures on logic 


 


it is manifest however in the first place that such lkct 

 wi 

a cross and hybrid and indirect reasoning from the 
one quantity to the other in the fourth figure is 
wholly of a different character and account from the j rn “ ul 
reasoning in the other three figures in which all 
inference whether upwards or downwards is equable 
and homogeneous within the same quantity the 
latter in short is natural and easy the former un 
natural and perverse 

in the second place the kind of reasoning compe ucie 
tent in the fourth figure is wholly useless the 
change from the one quantity to the other in the 
course of a syllogism is warranted by no necessity by 
no expediency the reasoning in each quantity is 
absolute and complete within itself and all that can 
be accomplished in the one process can equally well 
be accomplished in the other the jumping therefore 
from extension to comprehension or from compre 
hension to extension in the conclusion of the fourth 
figure is a feat about as reasonable and useful in 
logic as the jumping from one horse to another would 
be reasonable and useful in the racecourse both are 
achievements possible but because possible neither 
is therefore a legitimate exercise of skill 

we may therefore on the ground that the fourth 
figure involves a useless transition from one quantity 
to another reject it as a logical figure and degrade it 
to a mere logical caprice 

but in the third place there is a better ground loyally 
the inference though valid in itself is logically — is 
scientifically invalid for the inference is only legi 
timated by the occult conversion of the one quantity 
into the other which takes place in the mental process

there is thus a step taken in the reasoning which is 
not overtly expressed were the whole process stated 
in language as stated it logically ought to be instead 
of a simple syllogism with one direct conclusion we 
should have a complex reasoning with two conclusions 
one conclusion direct and immediate the inference 
to wit of conversion and from that immediate con 
clusion another mediate and indirect but which as it 
stands appears as the one sole and exclusive conclu 
sion from the premises this ground on which i 
think the fourth figure ought to be specially abolished

secondly to treat of the moods commencing then 
with the figures it is manifest that no exception can 
possibly lie taken to the first which is in point of 
fact no figure at all but the one regular — the one 
natural form of ratiocination the other three figures 
divide themselves into two classes the one of these 
classes comprehends the fourth the other the second

lect recognised by aristotle it obtained admission into 
— — the science at a comparatively recent period it has 
never in fact been universally recognised and its 
progress is manifestly more perverse circuitous and 
unnatural than that of any other 

in regard to this fourth figure i stated that the 
controversy among logicians touching its legitimacy 
had been without result its opponents failing to show 
that it ought to be rejected its defenders failing to 
show that it was deserving of recognition i then 
stated that the logicians in their onesided view of 
the reasoning process had let slip the one great prin 
ciple on which the legitimacy of this figure was to be 
determined i then explained to you that the pecu 
liarity of the fourth figure consists in this — that the 
premises are apparently the premises of a syllogism 
in one kind of quantity while its conclusion is the 
converted conclusion of a syllogism in the other it 
is thus in every point of view contorted and prepos 
terous its premises are transposed and the conclu 
sion follows from these not directly but through the 
medium of a conversion i showed how and how far 
this kind of reasoning was competent and that though 
the inference in the fourth figure is valid it is in 
convenient and useless and therefore that the form 
itself though undoubtedly legitimate is still only a 
legitimate monster herewith the lecture termin

foiinhfig ought to be at once expunged from the series of

the exception of the first must be rejected equally lect 
with the fourth and on the following ground — that — — — 
they do not in virtue of their own expressed pre 
mises accomplish their own inference but that this 
is done by the mental interpolation of certain comple 
mentary steps without which no conclusion in these 
figures could be drawn they are thus in fact reason 
ings apparently simple but in reality complex and 
when the whole mental process is expressed they are 
found to be all only syllogisms in the first figure with 
certain corollaries of the different propositions inter 
mingled® this doctrine corresponds with that of the 
logicians in so far as they after aristotle have allowed 
that the last three figures are only valid as reducible 
to the first and to accomplish this reduction they 
have supplied us with a multitude of empirical rules 
and lavished a world of ingenuity in rendering the 
working of these complex rules more easy from

hardly begun to reign when he was killed by the 
downfall of his palace so the other never entered on

ingenious latin as they only mark the consecution quantity

other two figures are to be reduced far less by what 
particular process this is to be done all this is ac

to the relative originality or the priority in point of 
date of these several inventions am unable to speak 
with certainty it is probable however that the

the simpler and ruder and because it is not known 
that he was acquainted with the writings of the 
western logicians whereas i find that the summulce

but the whole of the rules given by logicians for lfct 
the reduction of syllogisms are unphilosophical for 


they are merely the empirical statements of the opera oftodal

been overlooked but which when once rationally ex “

if i succeed therefore in explaining to you how the tfie lt

of a complex mental process i shall not only subvert mutilated 


their existence as forms of reasoning not virtually of a com 
identical with the first figure — i shall not only re process and 
lieve you from the necessity of studying the tedious identical 
and disgusting rules of their reduction but in fact first 
vindicate the great principles of reasoning from ap 
parent anomaly for in the first place if the three 
last figures are admitted as genuine and original forms 
of reasoning the principle that all reasoning is the re 
cognition of the relation of a least part to a greatest 
whole through a lesser whole or greater part is invali 
dated for in the three latter figures the middle term 
does not really hold the relation of an intermediate 
whole or part to the subject and predicate of the con 
clusion for either in the second figure it contains 
them both or in the third is contained by them both 
or in the fourth at once contains the greatest whole 

that is the predicate in extensive the subject in com 
prehensive quantity and is contained by the smallest 
part that is the subject in extensive the predicate 
in comprehensive quantity in the second place if 
these three figures are admitted as independent and 
legitimate forms the second general rule i gave you 
for categorical syllogisms is invalidated in both its 
clauses for it will not hold true that every cate

lect gorical syllogism must have an universal sumption 
xxil and an affirmative subsumption the law of the 
universal quantity of the sumption is violated in the 
third figure by disarms and bocardo in the fourth 
by dimaris the law of the affirmative quality of 
the subsumption is violated in the second figure by 
camestres and baroco and in the fourth by camenes 
i therefore proceed to reconcile all these anomalies by 
the extinction of the three last figures as more than 
accidental modifications of the first and commence 
with the following paragraph 

h lxxv the three last that is second third 
fourth figures are merely hybrid or mixed rea 
sonings in which the steps of the process are 

are in general conversive inferences which we 
are entitled to make ° from the absolute nega 
tion of a first notion as predicated of a second 
to the absolute negation of the second notion as 
predicated of the first — if no a is b then no 
b is a ° from the total or partial affirmation 
of a lesser class or notion of a greater to the 
partial affirmation of that greater notion of that 
lesser — if all or some a is b then some b 
is a

throwing out of account the ostensible sumption 
and considering the syllogism in its real nature as 
actually evolved out of the sumption mentally under

of the second figure a syllogism in celarent of the

first the seeming irregularity is thus reduced to 
real order 

the second mood of the second figure viz cam

process of redressing it though equally easy is some 
what more complex the formula is — 

all p are m 

but no s is m 

therefore no s is p 

here in the first place the premises are transposed 
for you remember by the second general law of syllo 
gisms the sumption must in extension be universal 
and the subsumption affirmative by a preliminary 
operation their apparent consecution must therefore 
be accommodated to their real the premises being 
restored to order there is yet a further intricacy to 
unravel the sumption and the conclusion are neither 
of them proximate for we depart from a conversive 
sumption and primarily obtain a conclusion which 
only gives us the ostensible conclusion in the second 
instance through an inference thus — 

ostensible sumption no s is m 

proximate or real sumption then no m is s 

subsumption all p arc m 

proximate or real conclusion therefore no p is 

ostensible conclusion therefore no s is p

the fourth mood baroco is more troublesome in 
fact this mood and bocardo in the third figure have 
been at once the cruces and the opprobria of logicians 
they have indeed succeeded in reducing these to the 
first figure by what is called the reductio ad impos 
sibile that is by circuitously showing that if you deny 
the conclusion in these syllogisms the contradictory 
inference is absurd but as of two contradictories one 
or other must be true it therefore remains that the 
original conclusion shall be admitted this process 
is awkward and perplexing it likewise only con 
strains assent but does not afford knowledge while 
at the same time we have here a syllogism with a 
negative subsumption which if legitimate invalidates 
the universality of our second general rule now on 
the principle have proposed to you there is no 
difficulty whatever in the reduction of this or of any 
other mood here however we do not as in the other 
moods of the second figure find that the syllogism 
proximately departs from an unexpressed sumption 
but that the proximate subsumption and the proxi 
mate conclusion have been replaced by two derivative 
propositions the formula of baroco is — 

all p are m 

but some s are not m 

therefore some s are not p 

 

but the following is the full mental process — 


sumption all p are m j 

real subsumption some not m are s 

which loves the c 


real conclusion therefore some not p are s

which gives the

then some s are not p

or to take our concrete example — 

all birds are oviparous 

but some animals are not oviparous 
therefore some animals are not birds 


of this the explicated process will stand as follows — 


sumption 

real subsumption 

which gives the 
expressed subsumption 


real or proximate conclusion 

which gives the

all birds are oviparous 
j some things not oviparous are 
 animals 

l then some animals are notovi 
 parous 
l or are not oviparous 

 therefore some things not birds 
are animals 

 then some animals are not 
birds 

or are not birds 


now in this analysis of the process in baroco we 
not only resolve the whole problem in a direct and 
natural and instructive way but we get rid of the 
exception which baroco apparently affords to the 
general rule that the subsumption of a categorical 
must be affirmative here you see how the real sub 
sumption is affirmative and how from having a 
negative determination in its subject it by conversion 
assumes the appearance of a negative proposition the 
affirmative proposition — some things nothirds are 
animals being legitimately converted first into — 
some animals are nothirds and this again being legi 
timately converted into — some animals are not birds 
you recollect that in the doctrine of propositions® i 
showed you how every affirmative proposition could

be adequately expressed in a negative and every 
negative in an affirmative form and the utility of 
that observation you now see as it enables us simply 
to solve the problem of the reduction of baroco and 
as we shall also see of bocardo baroco is thus 
directly reduced to darii of the first figure and not 
as by the indirect process of logicians in general to 
barbara on this doctrine the name baroco is also 
improper and another expressive of its genuine affin 
ity should be imposed 

we proceed now to the third figure you will 
observe that as in the second figure with the ex 


a there seems to be an error in the 
text here the syllogism as finally 
reduced is not in darii nor in any 
legitimate mood and its natuml re 
duction according to the method 
adopted by the author is not to darii 
but to ferio by means of an unex 
pressed sumption thus — 

a ll p are m 

then no not m are p 

some s are notm 

therefore some s are not p 

this is the method adopted by the 
following logicians referred to by the 
author in his common place book 
viz noldius who calls baroco fa

noldiub systema lexjicum § p

celarent and of baroco to ferio by 
counterposition he adds with spe

the syllogism of the text may also 
be exhibited more circuitously as

the third it is the subsumption for in camestres of 
the second and in disamis and bocardo of the third 
figure the premises are transposed this understood 
subsumption is a conversive inference from the ex

which the real conclusion is immediately inferred

ingly that in rigid truth there is no figure entitled 
to the dignity of a simple and independent form of 
reasoning except that which has improperly been 
termed the first the three latter figures being only 
imperfect or elliptical expressions of a complex pro 
cess of inference which when fully enounced is mani 
festly only a reasoning in the first figure there is 
thus but one figure or more properly but one process 
of categorical reasoning for the term figure is 
abusively applied to that which is of a character 
regular simple and essential 

having therefore concluded the treatment of figure 
in respect of categorical syllogisms it remains to con 
sider how far the other species of simple syllogisms — 
the hypothetical the disjunctive and the hypothetico 
disjunctive — are subject to this accident of form in 
regard to the hypothetical syllogism this kind of 
reasoning is not liable to the affection of figure it is 
true indeed that we may construct a syllogism of three 
hypothetical propositions which shall be susceptible 
of all the figures incident to a categorical reasoning 
but this is itself in fact only a categorical syllogism 
hypothetically expressed for example — 


if a is then b is 

but if s is then a is 
therefore if s is then b is 


this syllogism may certainly be varied through all 
the figures but it is not an hypothetical syllogism in 
the proper signification of the term but manifestly 
only a categorical and those logicians who have 
hence concluded that a hypothetical reasoning was 
exposed to the schematic modifications of the cate 
gorical have only shown that they did not know how

to discriminate these two forms by their essential

in regard to the disjunctive syllogism the case is

fabricated and employed for the purpose of de

indifferently in either sense these distinctions 
are however frequently confounded nor in a 
logical relation are they of account false 
syllogisms are again vicious either in respect 
of their form or of their matter or in respect of 
both form and matter 

in regard to the first distinction • contained in this 
paragraph — of syllogisms into correct or true and in 
correct or false — it is requisite to say a few words 
it is necessary to distinguish logical truth that is the 
truth which logic guarantees in a reasoning from the 
absolute truth of the several judgments of which a 
reasoning is composed i have frequently inculcated 
on you that logic does not warrant the truth of its 
premises except in so far as these may be the formal 
conclusions of anterior reasonings — it only warrants 
on the hypothesis that the premises are truly assumed 
the truth of the inference in this view the conclu 
sion may as a separate proposition be true but if this 
truth be not a necessary consequence from the pre 
mises it is a false conclusion that is in fact no con 
clusion at all now on this point there is a doctrine 
prevalent among logicians which is not only erroneous 
but if admitted is subversive of the distinction of 
logic as a purely formal science the doctrine in 
question is in its result this — that if the conclusion 
of a syllogism be true the premises may be either true 
or false but that if the conclusion be false one or 
both of the premises must be false in other words 
that it is possible to infer true from false but not 

a krug logik § — ed

false from true as an example of this i have seen 
given the following syllogism — 

aristotle is a roman 

a roman is a european 

therefore aristotle is a european 


the inference in so far as expressed is true but i 
would remark that the whole inference which the 
premises necessitate and which the conclusion there 
fore virtually contains is not true — is false for the 
premises of the preceding syllogism gave not only the 
conclusion aristotle is a european but also the con 
clusion aristotle is not a greek for it not merely 
follows from the premises that aristotle is conceived 
under the universal notion of which the concept roman 
forms a particular sphere but likewise that he is con 
ceived as excluded from all the other particular spheres 
which are contained under that universal notion the 
consideration of the truth of the premise aristotle 
is a roman is however more properly to be regarded 
as extralogical but if so then the consideration of 
the conclusion aristotle is a european on any 
other view than a mere formal inference from certain 
given antecedents is likewise extralogical logic is 
only concerned with the formal truth — the technical 
validity — of its syllogisms and anything beyond the 
legitimacy of the consequence it draws from certain 
hypothetical antecedents it does not profess to vindi 
cate logical truth and falsehood are thus contained 
in the correctness and incorrectness of logical in 
ference and it was therefore with no impropriety 
that we made a true or correct and a false or in 
correct syllogism convertible expressions®

sophisms 


in regard to the distinction of incorrect syllogisms 
into paralogisms and sophisms nothing need be said 
the mere statement is sufficiently manifest and at 
the same time it is not of a logical import for 
logic does not regard the intention with which rea 
sonings are employed but considers exclusively their 
internal legitimacy but while the distinction is one 
in other respects proper to be noticed it must be 
owned that it is not altogether without a logical value 
for it behoves us to discriminate those artificial 
sophisms the criticism of which requires a certain 
acquaintance with logical forms and which as a play 
of ingenuity and an exercise of acuteness are not 
without their interest from those paralogisms which 
though not so artificial are on that account only the 
more frequent causes of error and delusion 

the last distinction is however logically more im 
portant viz ° of reasonings into such as are mate 
rially fallacious that is through the objectmatter of 
their propositions ° into such as are formally falla 
cious that is through the manner or form in which 
these propositions are connected and ° into such as 
are at once materially and formally fallacious material 
fallacies lie beyond the jurisdiction of logic formal 
fallacies can only be judged of by an application of 
those rules in the exposition of which we have hither 
to been engaged 

the application of these rules will afford the oppor 
tunity of adducing and resolving some of the more 
capital of those sophisms which owe their origin to the 
ingenuity of the ancient greeks “many of these 
sophisms appear to us in the light of a mere play of 
wit and acuteness and we are left to marvel at the 
interest which they originally excited — at the celebrity 


lectures on logic 


 


which they obtained and at the importance attached 
to them by some of the most distinguished thinkers 
of antiquity the marvel will however be in some 
degree abated if we take the following circumstances 
into consideration 

“ in the first place in the earlier ages of greece the 
method of science was in its infancy and the laws of 
thought were not yet investigated with the accuracy 
and minuteness requisite to render the detection of 
these fallacies a very easy matter howbeit there 
fore men had an obscure consciousness of their fal 
lacy they could not at once point out the place in 
which the error lay they were thus taken aback 
confounded and constrained to silence 

“ in the second place the treatment of scientific 
subjects was more oral and social than with us and 
the form of instruction principally that of dialogue 
and con vernation in antiquity men did not isolate 
themselves so much in the retirement of their homes 
and they read far less than is now necessary in the 
modern world consequently with those who had a 
taste for science the necessity of social communication 
was greater and more urgent in their converse on 
matters of scientific interest acuteness and pro 
fundity were perhaps less conducive to distinction 
than vivacity wit dexterity in questioning and in 
the discovery of objections selfpossession and a 
confident and uncompromising defence of bold half 
true or even erroneous assertions through such 
means a very superficial intellect can frequently even 
wfith us puzzle and put to silence another far acuter 
and more profound but among the greeks the 
sophists and megaric philosophers were accomplished 
masters in these arts 


leot

lect “ in the third place as we know from aristotle and 

 diogenes laertius® it was the rule in their dialogical 

disputations that every question behoved to be an 
swered by a yes or a no and thus the interrogator 
had it in his power to constrain his adversary always 
to move in a foreseen and consequently a deter 
minate direction thus the sophisms were somewhat 
similar to a game at forfeits or like the passes of a 
conjuror which amuse and astonish for a little but 
the marvel of which vanishes the moment we under 
stand the principle on which they are performed” p 
as the various fallacies arise from secret violation 
of the logical laws by which the different classes of 
syllogisms are governed and as syllogisms are cate 
gorical or hypothetical or disjunctive or hypothetico 
disjunctive we may properly consider fallacies under 
these four heads and as transgressions of the syllo 
gistic laws in their special application to these several 
kinds of syllogism 

if lxxvii the syllogistic laws determine in 
reference to all the classes of syllogism the three 
following principles and all fallacies are viola 
tions of one or other of these principles in rela 
tion to one or other class of syllogism 

i if both the logical form and the matter of 
a syllogism be correct then is the conclusion 
true 

ii if the syllogism be materially correct but 
formally incorrect then the conclusion is not or 
only accidentally true

iii if the syllogism be formally correct but lect 
materially incorrect then the conclusion is not xxil 
or only accidentally true 

fallacies as violations of these principles in 
more immediate reference to one or other of the 
four classes of syllogism must again be vicious 
in reference either to the form or to the matter 
or to both the form and matter of a syllogism 

fallacies are thus again divided into formal and 
material under which classes we shall primarily 
arrange them 

h lxxviii of i ormal fallacies the catego parlxxvm 
rical are the most frequent and of these those fxcl 
whose vice lies in having four in place of three categoncal 
terms quaternione tenninomm for this in 
consequence of the ambiguity of its expression

genus are comprised three species which are 
severally known under the names of ° fallacia 
sensus compositi et divisi ° fallacia a dicto 
secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter et vice 
versa ° fallacia figures dictionis 

“ that in a categorical syllogism only three terms expiic 
are admissible has been already shown a categori fallacies 
cal syllogism with four capital notions has no con 
nection and is called by way of jest the logical 
quadruped animal quadrupes logicum this vice 
usually occurs when the notions are in reality differ 
ent but when their difference is cloaked by the ver 
bal identity of the terms for otherwise it would be 
too transparent to deceive either the reasoner himself 
or any one else this vice may however be of various

sensus com

divisi 


modes of 
this fallacy 


kinds and of these there are as stated three principal 
species” 

“ the first is the j fallacia sensus compositi et divisi — 
the fallacy of composition and division “ this arises 
when in the same syllogism we employ words now 
collectively now distributively so that what is true 
in connection we infer must be also true in separa 
tion and vice versa as for example — all must sin 
caius sins therefore caius must sin” p here we 
argue from the unavoidable liability in man to sin 
that this particular sin is necessary and for this indi 
vidual sinner “ this fallacy may arise in different 
ways ° it may arise when the predicate is joined 
with the subject in a simple and in a modal relation 
— for example — white can be ie become black 
therefore white can be black — ° it may arise from 
the confusion of a copulative and disjunctive combin 
ation thus consists or is made up of which 
are odd and even numbers therefcne is odd and 
even — ° it may arise if words connected in the pre 
mises are disjoined in the conclusion thus — sociates 
is dead therefore socrates is” 

an example of the first of these contingencies — 
that which is the most frequent and dangerous — 
occurs when from its universality a proposition must 
be interpreted with restriction thus when our 
saviour says the blind shall see — the deaf shall hear 
he does not mean that the blind as blind shall see —

that the deaf as deaf shall hear but only that those 
who had been blind and deaf should recover the use 
of these senses to argue the opposite would be to 
incur the fallacy in question 

the second fallacy is that a dicto secundum quid ad 
dictum simpliciter and its converse a dicto simpliciter 
ad dictum secundum quid the former of these — the 
fallacy a dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter — 
arises when from what is true only under certain modi 
fications and relations we infer it to be true absolutely 
thus if from the fact that some catholics hold the 
infallibility of the pope we should conclude that the 
infallibility of the pope is a tenet of the catholic 
church in general the latter the fallacy a dicto 
simpliciter ad dictum secundum quid is the opposite 
sophism where from what is true absolutely we con 
clude what is true only in certain modifications and 
relations — as for example when from the premise 
that man is a living organism we infer that a 
painted or sculptured man is a living organism ’ 
the third fallacy — the sophisma figures dictionis — 
arises when we merely play with the ambiguity of a 
word the wellknown syllogism mus syllaba est 
mus caseum rodit ergo syllaba caseum rod it is 
an example or 

herod is a fox 

a fox is a quadruped 

therefore herod is a quadruped 

to this fallacy may be reduced what are called the 
sophisma equivocationis the sophisma amphibolies 
and the sophisma accentus y which are only con 
temptible modifications of this contemptible fallacy

 lxxix of material fallacies those are of 
the most frequent occurrence where from a pre 
mise which is not in reality universal we conclude 
universally or from a notion which is not in 
reality a middle term we infer a conclusion 
under this genus there are various species of

sophisma pohjzeteseos and ° sophisma hetero

the nature of these considered apart then show that 
they both fall together the one being only the cate 
gorical the other only the hypothetical expression of 
the same vice and finally consider the various spe 
cies into which the generic fallacy is subdivided 
i or w “ our decisions concerning individual objects in so 
wslly far as they belong to certain classes are very fre 
quently fallacies of the former kind that is conclu 
sions from premises of an unreal universality for 
example — the jews are rogues — the carthaginians 
faithless — the cretans liars — the french braga 
docios — the geimans mystics — the rich purse 
proud — the noble haughty — women frivolous — 
the learned pedants — these and similar judgments 
which in general arc true only of many — at best only

of the majority of the subjects of a class often con lect 
stitute however the grounds of the opinions we form — i — 
of individuals so that these opinions with their 
grounds when expressed as conclusion and premises 
are nothing else than fallacies of an unreal generality 

— sophismata fctce universalitatis it is impossible 
however to decide by logical rules whether a proposi 
tion such as those above stated is or is not universally 
valid in this experience alone can instruct us logic 
requires only in general that every sumption should 
be universally valid and leaves it to the several 
sciences to pronounce whether this or that particular 
sumption does or does not fulfil this indispensable 
condition” ° the sophisma fictce universalitatis is 
thus a fallacious syllogism of the class of categoricals 

but the second kind of material fallacies the of unreal 
sophisms of unreal middle are not less frequent than mddle 
those of unreal universality when for example it 
is argued as was done by ancient philosophers that 
the mamet is animated because it moves another 
body or that the stars are animated because they 
move themselves — here there is assumed not a true 
but merely an apparent reason there is consequently 
no real mediation and the sophisma falsi medii is 
committed for in these cases the conclusion in the 
one depends on the sumption — if a body moves an 
other body it is animated in the other on the sump 
tion — if a body moves itself it is animated but as 
the antecedent and consequent in neither of these 
sumptions are really connected as reason and conse 
quent — or as cause and effect — there is therefore no 
valid inference of the conclusion the sophisma 

a krug logit § anm p cf krug logit p — ed

lect non causa ut causes is thus an hypothetical syllogism 
— — but as it may be categorically enounced this fallacy 
 unriti ’ of unreal reason will coincide with the categorical fal 
f trc“ d lacy of unreal universality thus the second example 
ttlitymm above alleged — 

ddtt 

if the stars move themselve s they arc animated 

 but the stars do move themselves 

therefore the stars are animated 

is thus expressed by a categorical equivalent — 

all bodies that move themselves are animated 

but the stars move themselves 

therefore the stars are animated 

in the one case the sumption ostensibly contains the 
subsumption and conclusion as the correlative parts 
of a causal whole in the other as the correlative 
parts of an extensive whole or had the categorical 
syllogism been so cast of an intensive whole the 
two genera of sophisms may therefore it is evident 
be considered as one — taking however in their par 
ticular manifestation either a categorical or an hypo 
thetical form 

faiiarv of i may notice that the sophism of unreal generality 
rea™ u or unreal reason is hardly more dangerous in its posi 
in it nca tive than in its negative relation for we are not 
itapusinvo more disposed lightly to assume as absolutely uni 
versal what is universal in relation to our experience 
than lightly to deny as real what comes as an excep 
tion to our factitious general law thus it is that 
men having once generalised their knowledge into a 
compact system of laws are found uniformly to deny 
the reality of all phenomena which cannot be compre 
hended under these they not only pronounce the 
laws they have generalised as veritable laws of nature

which haply they may be but they pronounce that lect 
there are no higher laws so that all which does not xx i i 
at once find its place within their systems they scout 
without examination as visionary and fictitious so 
much for this ground of fallacy in general we now 
proceed to the species 

now as unreal reasons maybe conceived infinite specks of 
in number the minor species of this class of sophisms of unreal 
cannot be enumerated i shall therefore only take r “° n 
notice of the more remarkable and which in conse 
quence of their greater notoriety have been honoured 
with distinctive appellations 

of these the first is the sojhisma cum hoc vel a soju 
post hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy arises when vtl toh 
from the contingent consecution of certain phenomena 
in the order of time we infer their mutual dependence 
as cause and effect when for example among the 
ancient romans a general without carefully consult 
ing the augurs engaged the enemy and suffered a 
defeat it was inferred that the cause of the disaster 
was the unfavourable character of the auspices in 
like manner to this sophism belongs the conclusion so 
long prevalent in the world that the appearance of a 
comet was the harbinger of famine pestilence and 
war in fact the greater number of the hypotheses 
which constitute the history of physics and philosophy 
are only so many examples of this fallacy but no 
science has exhibited and exhibits so many flagrant 
instances of the sophism cum hoc ergo propter hoc 
as that of medicine for in proportion as the connec 
tion of cause and effect is peculiarly obscure in physic 
physicians have only been the bolder in assuming that 
the recoveries which followed after their doses were 
not concomitants but effects this sophism is in

example 


practice of great influence and very frequent occur 
rence it is however in theory too perspicuous to 
require illustration 

the second fallacy is that which has obtained the 
name of ignava ratio or sophisma pigru m — in greek 
apyo xoyo° the excogitation of this argument is 
commonly attributed to the stoics by whom it was 
employed as subsidiaiy to their doctrine of fate “ it 
is an argument by which a man endeavours to vindi 
cate his inactivity in some particular relation by the 
necessity of the consequence it is an hypothetico 
disjunctive syllogism and when fully expressed is 
as follows — 

sumption if i ought to exert myself to effect a certain event 

this event cither must take place or it must 
not 

subsumption if it m ust take place my exertion is superfluous 

if if must not take place my exertion is of no 
avail 

conclusion therefore on either alternative my exertion is 

useless” p 

cicero in the twelfth chapter of his book de fato 
thus states it — 

if it he fated that you recover from your present disease whether 
you call in a doctor or not you icill recover again if it he 
fated that you do not recover from your present disease 
whether you call in a doctor or not you will not recover 
but one or other of the contradictories is fated 

therefore to call in a doctor is of no consequence 

others have enounced the sumption in various forms 
for example — if it be impossible but that you recover

from the present disease c — or — if it be true that lect 

you will recover from this disease — or — i fit be decreed 

by god that you will not die of this disease and so 
likewise in different manners according to which like tlon 
wise the question itself has obtained various titles as 
argument de fato — de possibilibus — de libero 
arbitrio — de procidentia — de divinis decretis — 

de futuris contingentibus — de physica prcedeter 
minatione c no controversy is more ancient 
none more universal none has more keenly agitated 
the minds of men none has excited a greater in 
fluence upon religion and morals it has not only 
divided schools but nations and has so modified not 
only their opinions but their practice that whilst the 
turks as converts to the doctrine of fate take not 
the slightest precaution in the midst of pestilence 
other nations on the contrary who admit the contin 
gency of second causes carry their precautionary 
policy to an opposite excess 

the common doctrine that this argument is an in history 
vention of the stoics and a ground on which they 
rested their doctrine of the physical necessitation of 
human action is however erroneous if we may 
accord credit to the testimony of diogenes laertius 
who relates in the life of zeno the founder of this 
sect that he bestowed a sum of two hundred minae 
on a certain dialectician from whom he had learned 
seven species of the argument called the xoyo €pc 
 metens or reaper — which differs little if at all 
from the ignava ratio a for how this sophism is con

sophism

tlepl epiirvelol a of the same character likewise 
is the argument called the xoyos kvpcevcov the 
ratio dominansy or controlling reason the process of 
which arrian describes under the nineteenth chapter 
of the second book of the sayings of epictetus 
the lazy reason — the reaper — and the controlling 
reason are thus only various names for the same pro 
cess 

in regard to the vice of this sophism “ it is mani 
fest that it lies in the sumption in which the disjunct 
members are imperfectly enounced it ought to have 
been thus conceived — if i ought to exert myself to 
effect a certain event which i cannot however of my 
self effect this event must either take place from 
other causes or it must not take place at all it is 
only under such a condition that my exertion can on 
either alternative be useless and not if the event 
depend wholly or in part for its accomplishment on 
my exertion itself as the conditio sine qua non” it 
is plain however that the refutation of this sophism 
does not at all affect the doctrine of necessity for 
this doctrine except in its very absurdest form — 
the fatum turcicum — makes no use of such a rea 
soning 

“ the third fallacy is the sophisma polyzeteseos 
or queestionis duplicisy — the sophism of continuous 
questioningy which attempts from the impossibility of 
assigning the limit of a relative notion to show by 
continued interrogation the impossibility of its deter 
mination at all there are certain notions which are

only conceived as relative — as proportional and whose 
limits we cannot therefore assign by the gradual 
addition or detraction of one determination but 
there is no consequence in the proposition that 
if a notion cannot be determined in this manner it is 
incapable of all determination and therefore abso

the nature of which i have already explained to you

one grain of corn make up a heap of grain my op 
ponent answers — no i then go on asking the same 
question of two three four and so on ad infinitum 
nor can the respondent find the number at which the 
grains begin to constitute a heap on the other hand 
if we depart from the answer — that a thousand grains 
make a heap the interrogation may be continued 
downward to unity and the answerer be unable to 
determine the limit where the grains cease to make 
up a heap the same process may be performed it is

manifest upon all the notions of proportion in space

the fourth and last fallacy of this class is the 
sophisma hcterozetescos or sophism of counterques 
tioning and as applied to various objects it obtained 
among the ancients the names of the dilemma y — the 
cornutus — the litigiosus — the achiucs — the men 
tions — the fallens v — the electro b — the ohvelatus — 
the reciprocus k — the crocodilinus k — the ovrisp — the 
inductio imperfecta and to this should also be re 
ferred the ass of buridanust “ it is a hypothetico 
disjunctive reasoning which rests on a certain suppo 
sition and which through a reticence of this supposi 
tion deduces a fallacious inference to take for an 
example of this fallacy the cepartws or cornutus — 
it is asked — have you cast your horns — if you 
answer i have it is rejoined then you have had 
horns if you answer i have not it is rejoined then 
you have them still — to this question and to the 
inferences from it the disjunctive proposition is sup 
posed — a certain subject has either had horns or has 
them still this disjunction is however only correct

if the question is concerning a subject to which horns lect 
previously belonged if i do not suppose this the — — 
disj unction is false it must consequently thus run 

— a certain subject has either had or not had horns 

in the latter case they could not of course be cast 

the alternative inferences then you have had them or 
then you have them still have no longer ground or 
plausibility”® to take another instance in the liti’yywlmguh 
giosus or reciprocus of the history of this famous 
dilemma there are two accounts the greek and the 
roman the roman account is given us by aulus 
gellius and is there told in relation to an action 
between protagoras the prince of the sophists and the case of 
euathlus a young man his disciple the disciple had nwl euath 
covenanted to give his master a large sum to accom 
plish him as a legal rhetorician the one half of the 
sum was paid down and the other was to be paid on 
the day when euathlus should plead and gain his 
first cause but when the scholar after the due 
course of preparatory instruction was not in the same 
hurry to commence pleader as the master to obtain 
the remainder of his fee protagoras brought euathlus 
into court and addressed his opponent in the follow 
ing reasoning — learn most foolish of young men 
that however matters may turn up — whether the 
decision today be in your favour or against you — 
pay me my demand you must for if the judgment 
be against you i shall obtain the fee by decree of the 
court and if in your favour i shall obtain it in terms 
of the compact by which it became due on the very 
day you gained your first cause you thus must 
fail either by judgment or by stipulation to this 
euathlus rejoined — most sapient of masters learn

pay nothing by the sentence of the judges but if 
unfavourable i pay nothing in virtue of the compact

descriptive and industrial 

by david page fgs 

second edition enlarged with numorous engravings s 

 an admirable book on geology it is from no invidious desire to underrate other works — it is 
the simple expression of iuntiue — which causes us to assign to mr page’s advanced textbook the 
very first place among geological works addressed to students at toast among those which have come 
before us we have read every word of it with care and with delight never hesitating as to ite 
meaning never delecting the omission of anything needful in a popular and succinct exposition of a 
rich and varied subject” — leader 

 it is therefore with unfeigned pleasuro that wo record our appreciation of his advanced text 
book of geology wo have carefully read this truly satisfactory book and do not hesitate to say 
that it is an excellent compendium of the great facts of geology and written in a truthful and philo 
sophic spirit — edinburgh philosophical journal 

“we know of no introduction containing a jnrger nmonnt of information in the same space and 
which we could more cordially recommeud to tlic geological student — athcnaum 


handbook of geological terms and 

geology 

by david page fgs 

in crown octavo prico ga 

“ • to the student miner engineer architect agriculturist and others who may havo occasion to 
deal with geological facts and yet who might not be inclined to turn tip half a dozen volumes or go 
through a course of geological readings for an explanation of the term in question mr page lias car 
ried out his object with the most complete success his book amply fulfils the promise contained in 
its title constituting a handbook not only of geological terms but of the science of geology it will 
not only be absolutely indispensable to the student but will be invaluable as a complete and handy 
book of reference even to the advanced geologist ” — literary gazette 

“ there is no more earnest living practical worker in geology than mr david page to his excel 
lent introductory textbook of geology and his advanced textbook of geology descriptive and 
industrial lie has now added an admirable system of geological terms with ample and clearly written 
explanatory notices such as all geological observers whether they are able professors and distin 
guished lecturers or mere inquirers upon tho threshold of the science must tind to be of the highest 
value — practical mechanics journal 

m but mr page’s work is very much more than simply a translation of the language of geology 
into plain english it is a dictionary in which not only the meaning of the words is given but also 
a clear uud concise account of all that is most remarkable and worth knowing in the objects which 
the words aro designed to express in doing this he has chiefly kept in view the requirements of the 
general reader but at tho same time adding such details us will render the volume an acceptable 
handbook to the student and professed geologist ’¦ — the press

institutes of metaphysic 

the theory of knowing and being 

by james f ferrier ab oxon 

profesjor of moral philosophy and political economy st andrews 

second edition 


extracts from reviews 

eclectic review 

we might havo written a very different article on this remarkable book dwelling on 
its strong points instead of its weak ones calling attention to the value of many of pro 
fessor ferrier b views and especially of his historical criticisms and illustrating by 
extracts his mastery over thought and language and his wonderful power of presenting 
the most abstruse thought in a clear commonsense light and clothing tho most arid 
themes with a vivacity and felicity of diction which a poet or an orator might envy and 
to which few indeed among metaphysicians can pretend 

london quarterly review 

this is in all respects a most remarkable book when wo began its perusal wo were 
greatly excited by the magnificent promiso it laid before us which was no loss than 
by an unfaltering march and process of reason of demonstration to arrive before and 
capture tho fort of absolute existence professor forrier writes with such genius such 
passion such enthusiasm ho is so evidently master of his subject and lias thought it 
out from beginning to end he is so conversant with the history of previous failures and 
so aware of the futility of the expectations of metaphysic from psychology that if any 
man may hope to make sure the foundation and place tho copingstone of on edifice of 
metaphysic it will be professor forrier 

british quarterly review 

this is no ordinary book if wo mistake not its publication will mark an epoch in 
tho history of speculation in this country 

daily new 

tho m institutes of metaphysic is indeed tho most suggestive work on tho subject 

that has beon published for many a long year and it is the most readable 

while thus decidedly differing from tho tenets of irofosor forrier wo cannot close tho 
book without again acknowledging in tho frankest manner tho delight we have derived 
from its perusal and tho bracing influence of its bold and free discussions did our 
limits permit of it wo should have liked to make some quotations to show the beauty 
of tho writing and tho wit and humour that are so lavishly scattered over a theme that 
in ordinary hands is a very sahara of aridity and dulness 

examiner 

wo havo expressed as fairly ns we can in our irreverent unphilosophical way tho 
position taken by professor ferrier we have only to add that he maintains it most 
ably thinks it out doeply and in its illustration displays everywhere a genius for 
metaphysical reasoning of a very rare and original order

second edition 


extracts from reviews 

worth british review 

this volume is sure sooner or later to have many readers notwithstanding its de 
fects to which wo shall refer the subjects treated of and the style always chasto 
and beautiful often attractively quaint in which they are clothed will not fail to secure 

the attention of tho class for whom the work is avowedly writteu it deals 

with many of those higher forms of speculation characteristic of the cultivated minds 
of the age 

praser’s magazine 

mr smith has read deeply and accurately into human nature in all its weaknesses 
fancies hopes and fears it is long since we have met with a more remarkable or wor 
thy book mr smith is always thoughtful and suggestive he has been entirely success 
ful in carrying out his wish to produce a volume in rending which a thoughtful man will 
often pause with his finger betweon the leaves and muso upon what ho has read we 
judgo that tho book must have boon written slowly and at intervale from its affluence 
of beautiful thought no mind could have tumod off such material with the equablo 
flow of a stream wo know few works in which there may be found so many fino 
thoughts light bringing illustrations and happy turns of expression to invito tho 
readers pencil 

ouardien 

it possesses the great and rare charm of perfect elcganco of stylo it is oosc and 
free because colloquial and easy but it never offers an obscuro sentonco or a clumsy 
illustration it is one of tho few books which will bear to bo read slowly its spirit 
does not evaporate by exposure 

sun 

the tone indeed is at onco eminently religious and eminently philosophical and 
the effect of tho whole is in truth to sum up all in a few words exquisitely and pro 
foundly pathetic “ thomdalo” comprises within it the thought of a lifetime its 
every syllable shows it to be the production of a thoroughly earnest man and that man 
a christian gentleman 

patriot 

viewed as a literary production the chief light in which we think its author would 
have it viewed this book commands our high approbation and all but unqualified 
praise the stylo though not always equal is a pure crystalline vehicle of thought 
tho minutest shade of which has easy and beautiful expression while there aro numer 
ous passages of such exquisite beauty and tenderness and truth that wo lingor over 
them and often return to thorn with accuse of fascination wo could fill columns 
with extracts 

scotsman 

but this loose description would give an unfair impression of tho book though not 
peculiarly original it contains a great deal that is original and sufficient to show tho 
shaping disposing and suggesting powers of a creative mind it reflects as in a mirror 
all the speculation of tho ago it combines it arranges it and gives it definiteness 
opposing doctrines find always fair and adequato often admirably effective expression 
the author’s mind is so finely balanced that it can weigh any speculative dogma it 
has no pcrceptiblo bias it is in short a singularly sceptical and unbiassed mind 
subtle in speculative thought and capable of giving beautiful utterance to such thought 
more literary gems chiefly comparisons could be picked from this than almost any recent 
volume wc know it is a repository of select thoughts— tho fruit of much reflection 
much reading and many years
