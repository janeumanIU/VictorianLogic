preface 



the attempt made in the following pages to 

determine the meaning of some of the principal 

terms employed in philosophy may to some 

appear an ambitious undertaking while to 

others it may seem merely a verbal affair if 

to emulate the great of old be ambition to 

that the author must plead guilty for aristotle 

himself composed a philosophical vocabulary 

and on the other hand that the object of such 

a work is useful and dignified will be allowed 

by those who are best acquainted with the 

difficulties of philosophy i may mention in 

particular two distinguished philosophers of the 

present day who have thus expressed themselves 

on this subject 

a 



vi preface 

dr whewell observes that discussions and 
speculations concerning the import of very ab 
stract and general terms and notions may be 
and in reality have been far from useless and 
barren such discussions arose from the desire 
of men to impress their opinions on others but 
they had the effect of making the opinions much 
more clear and distinct in trying to make 
others understand them they learnt to understand 
themselves their speculations were begun in 
twilight and ended in the full brilliancy of 
day 

again mr mill remarks that although ac 
cording to the views here presented definitions 
are of names only and not of things it does 
not follow that definition is an easy matter 
how to define a name may not only be an 
inquiry of considerable difficulty and intricacy 
but may turn upon considerations going deep into 
the nature of the things which are denoted by 
the name such for instance are the inquiries

which form the subject of the most important of 
platos dialogues 
it would be a mistake to represent these diffi 
cult and noble inquiries as having nothing in view 
beyond ascertaining the conventional meaning 
of a name they are inquiries not so much to 
determine what is as what should be the meaning 
of a name which like other practical questions 
of terminology requires for its solution that we 
should enter and sometimes very deeply into the 
properties not merely of names but of the things 
named 

the part of the work likely to meet with 
the most opposition is that wherein are discussed 
the nature and value of the syllogism the 
importance of correct opinions on this subject 
the long and still fondly cherished errors as i 
conceive concerning it the great names from 
aristotle down even to the present day arrayed 
against me the authority and teaching of one 
venerable university all induced me to devote 
patient and oft repeated thought to this question

well pleased indeed should i be could i 
have arrived at a conclusion supported by some 
of the first men of our times and sorry above 
all am i to oppose the deep convictions of one 
eminent man whom i rejoicc to call a friend 
but my apology shall be given in the words of 
his favourite author aristotle words adopted as 
his own namely that a philosopher a lover of 
wisdofhy is bound in the cause of truth to refute 
all error be it the error of himself or of his 
friends for though friends be dear it is still his 
hallowed duty to give the higher reverence to 
truth to that sentiment i fully subscribe 
and i feel confident that nothing here said will 
interrupt for one moment that friendly intercourse 
which has so long subsisted between us and 
which by me has ever been considered as a 
pleasure a profit and a privilege

substance 



substance is a word applied to two things 
apparently as different as any can be namely 
matter and mind or body and spirit but in 
spite of this great difference there must be some 
resemblance however faint otherwise a common 
name would hardly have been given to them 
what then is this circumstance belonging to 
both on account of which each is called a sub 
stance this it would appear is nothing but per 
mannce— permanence amid innumerable changes 
or modifications matter may undergo very 
great changes from a solid it may become a 
liquid from a liquid an air or gas or two 
gases may unite and in so doing may lose their 
own properties or acids with alkalis may form 
neutral salts but something still remains con 



j philosophical vocabulary 

stant so the mind may pass through an innu 
merable variety of conditions — far more than 
we can express in words such as sensations 
thoughts emotions which comprise vast classes 
of phenomena but through all this variety 
there is something fixed or permanent it is on 
this account we conceive that the term sub 
stan ce has been applied to both mind and body 
a substance then may be defined as something 
permanent or constant amid innumerable modifica 
tions 

from the above it appears that widely dif 
ferent as the substances matter and mind un 
doubtedly are there are still things more diflferent 
such are mind and the modifications of matter 
or its qualities matter and the modifications or 
qualities and the phenomena of mind for these 
have not even the common property of per 
manence or constancy and consequently they 
have no common name 

substance is a genus comprehending two 
species mind or spirit and body or matter 
so far as each is a substance they have some 
thing in common but by what differences are 
they separated 

matter has sometimes been defined as the 
outward and unknown cause of our sensations 
but when we come to enquire what is a sensa 



substance 



tion we say that it is a mental phenomenon of 
which the cause or at least the invariable ante 
cedent is some change in the state of our body 
hence matter orbodyis defined as the cause of 
sensation and sensation as the effect of body 
or we define in a circle let us then see whether 
we have not some less vague notion of matter 

matter certainly gives occasion in us to in 
numerable sensations and notions consequent 
thereon and there are a few of these sensations 
and notions which we never fail to experience 
whenever matter is present and on which there 
fore we have fixed as serving to distinguish it 
from other things but in this case it is not on 
the sensations that we fix but on the notions 
thence derived the former being quite over 
looked 

thus first j all matter gives us the notion of 
exiensioriy and therefore we say that all matter is 
extended and thus we distinguish it from spirit 
secondly all matter gives us the notion of so 
lidity or impenetrability which means that it 
fills space or that two bodies cannot occupy the 
same space at the same time thus is matter 
distinguished from simple extension 

now our notion of matter always compre 
hends these two notions together with the notion 
of substance before stated and from these we 



 philosophical vocabulary 

cannot doubt that it originated and we think 
from these alone and not from colour sound or 
taste as for the two latter we can conceive 
matter without them at all and indeed there 
are not a few born deaf who yet know matter 
and we cannot suppose that a mere want of taste 
would be attended by a total ignorance of the 
world without nay there have been children 
born deaf dumb and blind who yet were ac 
quainted with matter if this be so the notion 
of matter does not necessarily embrace colour 
and was certainly not derived from it though 
those who enjoy sight may not from constant 
association easily abstract colour from matter 
the power of conceiving a thing without another 
thing is a proof that the conception of the former 
is independent of the conception of the latter 
but our inability to conceive the one without the 
other is no proof that the two conceptions are 
necessarily inseparable for the inability may be 
owing to long continued association 

from the above it follows that matter may be 
defined to be an bartended solid substance spirit 
on the other hand is supposed neither to be ex 
tended nor solid but its existence is known to us 
from the various mental phenomena of which we 
are conscious — sensations thoughts emotions 
amid the constant and rapid succession of these 



ubbtance 



phenomena we cannot help believing that there 
is something permanent which is therefore a 
substance and which i call self the existence 
of this substance is more intimately known is 
brought more home to us in other words is 
known more immediately than that of matter for 
the former is known by phenomena which are 
states of its own being the latter through the 
medium of those mental states called sensations 
which are totally distinct from matter itself 

from all this it appears that spirit may be 
defined to be a substance neither extended nor 
solidj but susceptible of sensations thoughts and 
emotions 

here it is not said that the word spirit or 
mind implies a substance which at all times 
thinks or feels for it is a disputed point whether 
or not there be always some consciousness as in 
deep sleep or in a swoon but we should never 
give the name of mind to that which either had 
never been conscious or which had ceased to be 
capable of consciousness it is then the capa 
bility which the term implies and not the con 
stant exercise of that capability 



philosophical vocabulary 



quality 

the word substance simply signifying perma 
nent existence seems to be one out of a very 
small number of terms which are strictly non 
relative not so quality which is synonymous 
with power and implies the relation of cause 
and eflfect all our knowledge of matter is derived 
from its effects upon us that is from our sensa 
tions and all our knowledge of spirit is obtained 
from its own sensations thoughts and emotions 
and though these sensations thoughts and emo 
tions be ever changing yet we believe not only 
that there is something permanent which gives 
rise to them all and which in the one case we call 
matter in the other mind but also that each sen 
sation thought and emotion has a peculiar per 
manent cause either external or internal material 
or mental and this we call a quality but as our 
experience tells us that outward objects as well 
as our own minds undergo in the course of time 
considerable changes we do not attach the same 
degree of permanence to a quality as to matter 
or mind itself the quality however is nothing 
distinct from matter or mind it is one or the 
other in a certain state — in other words it is a 



qualitt 

modification of either less constant than sub 
stance — more so than a mere phenomenon when 
i experience a sensation of redness i say that the 
object before me is red or has the quality of red 
ness meaning that i believe that the cause of the 
sensation is an outward object and that the object 
which now affects me thus will always affect me 
in like manner ray eyesight and my distance from 
the object remaining the same and not me only 
but all persons similarly situated i can clearly 
distinguish between the passing sensation of red 
ness and the cause which i believe to be perma 
nent and which for a thousand years may arouse 
similar sensations in successive generations of 
men but wind rain or other casualties may in 
time change the colour from red to black or en 
tirely alter the figure or even the intimate nature 
of the object and it is conceivable that our sen 
sations from the same object may vary and 
consequently a quality has not necessarily the 
permanence of simple substance substance has 
been defined to be something permanent among 
innumerable modifications now these modifi 
cations are either qualities or phenomena and the 
former are permanent as compared with the latter 
but were all animated nature at once destroyed 
there would be an end to the qualities of matter 
zs we comprehend them because quality supposes 



 philosophical vocabulary 

two things — an outward object and a percipient 
mind though there might still be substance 

this account of quality agrees perfectly with 
the doctrine of locke contained in the following 
passage and i am the more desirous of quoting 
that passage because the opinions of locke have 
been so much misrepresented and this subject in 
particular has been so much mystified by suc 
ceeding writers — whatever the mind perceives 
in itself or is the immediate object of perception 
thought or understanding that i call idea and 
the power to produce any idea in our mind i call 
quality of the subject wherein that power is 
thus a snowball having the power to produce in 
us the idea of white cold and round the power 
to produce those ideas in us as they are in the 
snowball i call qualities and as they are sen 
sations or perceptions in our understandings i 
call them ideas which ideas if i speak of them 
sometimes as in the things themselves i would 
be understood to mean those qualities in the 
objects which produce them in us — essay con 
cerning human understanding book ii chap viii 
sec see also sec 

had locke written nothing more on the 
subject of quality than this section it seems 
impossible that his opinions could have been mis 
understood and we can attribute the disputes 



quality y 

which have arisen with respect to him only to 
some unguarded expressions in the remainder of 
the chapter and in particular to his observations 
on primary and secondary dualities from 
whence i think it is easy to draw this observation 
that the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are 
resemblances of them and their patterns do 
really exist in the bodies themselves but the 
ideas produced in us by these secondary qualities 
have no resemblance to them at all there is 
nothing like our ideas existing in the bodies 
themselves they are in the bodies we denomi 
nate from them only a power to produce those 
sensations in us and what is sweet blue or warm 
in idea is but the certain bulk figure and motion 
of the insensible parts in the bodies themselves 
which we call so sec 

this distinction does not seem well founded 
the ideas of primary qualities no more resemble 
the qualities themselves than the ideas of se 
condary qualities resemble these the quality 
the cause is always external the idea the effect 
resulting from it always internal and the one 
can bear no resemblance to the other the former 
appertaining to matter the latter to mind the 
secondary quality is quite as real as the primary 
and we have quite as much reason to believe the 
one as the other either both exist outwardly or 

c 



 phifxphical vocabulary 

neither we are as firmly convinced that there 
exists something without the cause of the sen 
sation of blueness as we are that there is an 
outward cause of the sensation of resistance 

nevertheless there is a good distinction be 
tween the primary and secondary qualities of 
matter and it consists in this that the former 
alone are sufficient to constitute what locke calls 
the nominal essence in other words sufficient to 
our notion of matter so that wherever these 
qualities exist there we say is matter and 
wherever these qualities exist not there we say 
is none the primary qualities then are those 
to the union of which we have given the name 
matter and the statement of them is the defini 
tion of this term of course then they must be 
inseparable from matter under all its modifica 
tions for were they not present we should not 
apply the name when we say that they consti 
tute our notion of matter we imply that they 
are inseparable from it and afterwards to state 
that they are so is a truism and nothing more 

what those qualities are which are sufficient 
to induce us to give the name of matter we have 
already seen they are extension and solidity 
or impenetrability ah other qualities are se 
condary for they do not of necessity enter into 
our notions of a material substance bodies may 



quality 

be without colour as in the dark without sound 
as in a vacuum without smell without taste but 
still they are matter 

it is no doubt very difficult for us who see 
to conceive matter without colour but this is 
only the result of constant association for we 
know that those born blind are acquainted with 
colourless matter a druggist or apothecary 
cannot easily conceive senna apart from its pur 
gative effect but a botanist is wholly taken up 
with the marks which determine its class order 
genus and species and thinks not at all of its 
medicinal virtues facility or difficulty of con 
ception then proves only frequency or infre 
quency of association and is no test of what is 
required and alone required in other words of 
what is sufficient or essential to our notion of 
that thing to which we give a name whether it 
be matter or any other 

there is another division of qualities which 
deserves to be attended to viz that into simple 
and relative the simple qualities of bodies 
are those which affect our senses without chang 
ing other bodies as redness blueness hardness 
softness roughness smoothness c smells and 
tastes c 

the relative qualities are such as first change 
other bodies and then operate anew upon our 



 philosophical vocabulary 

senses as an acid which changes a vegetable 
blue to red or by mixing with an alkali produces 
a new substance a salt or as fire which melts 
lead or causes the explosion of gunpowder 
though this distinction be well founded yet we 
must not suppose that simple dualities involve 
no relation they certainly imply a relation 
between the outward object and the percipient 
mind for when we say that blood is red or has 
the quality of redness we mean that it is a sub 
stance which rouses in us a sensation of redness 

 

but relative dualities imply no less than four 
relations to take the case of an acid uniting 
with an alkali to form a salt there is first the 
simple relation between the acid and our per 
cipient mind secondly the relation between the 
alkali and our mind thirdly the relation be 
tween the acid and the alkali resulting in a 
mutual transformation which third relation is 
known to us by a fourth that between the new 
product a salt and our mind which perceives it 
therefore there is a wellmarked distinction be 
tween simple and relative qualities and the 
names seem sufficiently well chosen for the pur 
pose the one set of dualities being so much more 
simple than the other 

the word attribute seems to be nearly if 
not quite synonymous with quality only it is 



quality 

not so often used in reference to body being 
mostly confined to spirit and often applied in 
particular to that great spirit which created and 
governs the universe 

attribute of mind like duality of body means 
something less constant than simple substance 
more so than a mere phenomenon and yet not 
distinct from substance any more than phenome 
non is but only that substance existing not in 
any state whatever for then it would be simply 
substance nor yet in a fleeting state for then it 
would be merely phenomenon but in a state 
which may be called habitual being apt to recur 
and to continue for some time an attribute 
may therefore be defined as an habitual state of 
mind the assemblage of the moral attributes is 
called the disposition 

 for other meanings of the word attribute and in particular 
the distinction hetween the logical and the metaphysical sense see 
the article on the categories part ii art 



 philosophical vocadulary 



quantity 

the word quality necessarily implies sub 
stance mental or bodily for a quality is nothing 
but a substance existing in such a state as to 
render us conscious of its existence whether by 
means of sensation as in the case of body or of 
any mental phenomenon whatsoerer as in the 
case of mind quality then is inseparable 
from substance but not so quantity for 
time and space have quantity since we under 
stand what we say when we talk of the length of 
a mile or of a day and neither time nor space 
necessarily imply substance and though quan 
tity belongs to all bodies yet is it not peculiar to 
body for neither time nor space is material 
to know then what is meant by quantity we 
must consider it where it exists with the least 
possible complication with other things 

since quantity belongs to both space and 
time these have something in common but 
what is that something time and space agree 
in this and in this only that they have parts 
and are capable of increase or diminution by 
the addition or the subtraction of the parts 
and this addition or subtraction may go on to 



quantity s 

infinity in other words without any limit which 
we can assign who can set bounds to the 
multiplication or division of miles or of years 
quantity then being that which is common to 
space and time means this capability when a 
thing can be increased or diminished ad infinitum 
by adding or subtracting similar parts there is 
quantity but where it cannot be so increased or 
diminished there we have quality which admits 
of shades or degrees not accurately fixed and 
that soon find a limit thus we talk of degrees 
of excellence in tastes degrees of hardness and 
softness the shades of colour or of good and 
evil c c 

in all these we soon reach a limit beyond 
which if we attempt to go we change the quality 
into something else what is whiter than snow 
do we attempt to produce greater whiteness we 
change it altogether 

quantity on the contrary has no shades be 
cause one quantity is perfectly distinct from 
every other and no limit shades suppose 
gradual and insensible approximation and hence 
indistinctness but one is as distinct from two as 
from two thousand 

this is the reason why the relations of quan 
tity alone admit of demonstration here every 
difference is distinct whereas in other things 



 philosophical vocabulary 

each difference is not distinct therefore mo 
rality does not admit of demonstration as locke 
supposes the shades of action are innumerable 
and indistinctly marked in questions respecting 
quantity there is but one alternative — either a 
thing is or it is not but in all other subjects 
there may be a middle term or many middle 
terms partaking of the character of the two op 
posites either the two angles of a triangle are 
equal to two right angles or they are not but 
who shall say that one form of government is 
always good another always bad that one line 
of policy or one mode of action is invariably the 
best another always the worst these very 
words best and worst suppose many intervening 
degrees of goodness cluantity then is the sub 
ject of demonstrative quality of probable rea 
soning because the differences of the one are 
determinate of the other indeterminate 

quantity is particularly interesting and im 
portant as forming the subject of the only perfect 
science we possess — mathematics from what 
has been above said it follows that if pure mathe 
matics be really the science of quantity as is 
universally allowed then that science is alto 
gether independent of matter the definitions of 
euclid prove the same thing a point we are 
told is that which has position but not magni 



quantity 

tude a line is length without hreadth but in 
the material world there are no such points and 
lines therefore pure geometry is not a science 
of matter is it then a branch of mental 
science certainly not in the general accepta 
tion of that term for quantity has nothing to 
do with mind or spirit either with the substance 
thereof or the phenomena who ever heard of 
half a soul or of twothirds of a sensation 
thought or emotion but if pure mathematics 
be neither a material nor a mental science what 
can it be for that division seems to exhaust 
the subject we answer that it is the science of 
quantity under its three modifications of space 
time and number arithmetic is the science 
of number geometry of extension whether of 
one two or three dimensions while algebra 
comprehends number extension and time for 
letters may apply to any of these such is pure 
mathematics which ought to be classed apart 
in a comprehensive division of the sciences and 
not to be confounded either with mental or with 
material or physical science with which last it is 
commonly joined it is a science strictly sui generis 
or a summum genus embracing three species arith 
metic geometry and algebra according to this 
view science would embrace three leading di 
visions metaphysics physics and mathematics 

• see ramsays classification of tbe sciences 



 philosophical vocabulary 

belonging to this subject there is a very in 
teresting question as to the foundation and 
nature of mathematical certainty since that 
science treats neither of mind nor of matter it 
follows that its certainty depends not upon the 
existence of either of these let the earth be 
dissolved and all that live thereon still the truths 
of mathematics will remain whatever exists as 
matter or as mind may change or cease to be 
and therefore the science thereof may fail but 
we must alter or set bounds to time and space 
before we can change the certainty of mathe 
matics 

it has been said by an exceedingly able writer 
of the present day see milvs system of logic 
book ii chap v that the certainty of mathe 
matics is merely hypothetical that its propo 
sitions are true in the sense that they follow 
irresistibly from an hypothesis and in that sense 
only thus when a line is defined as length 
without breadth or a triangle as a figure with 
three sides and three angles we are told that the 
tacit assumption is made and such a thing 
exists on this assumption and others simi 
lar it is said rest all the demonstrations of 
mathematics when we define a line as 
above do we then really mean to imply that 
such a line exists in the world of matter 



whormbh 



quantity 

if we do then we enounce at the very be 
ginning a notorious falsehood and no con 
clusions drawn from it can be worth attending 
to the boasted science of mathematics be 
comes like the ravings of a madman who first 
fancies himself a king and then reasons well 
accordingly 

but if what we have above said as to the na 
ture of quantity be correct then mathematical 
demonstration is quite independent of matter 
and consequently we do not assume that the 
points lines triangles circles c as defined in 
books of geometry have any existence in the 
material universe no doubt it was by the ma 
terial world that we first became acquainted with 
points lines triangles c approximating to those 
defined but having once got these ideas through 
our sensations we can afterwards detach them 
from matter and consider them as modifications 
of pure space look at the arch of a bridge 
without the stone and lime which form the arch 
i might never have conceived a curve but having 
once seen a curve in matter i can imagine one 
immaterial what is included between the arch 
the piers and the water below forms a definite 
figure in empty space the air being invisible 
from constant association with matter it is no 
doubt difficult if not impossible to avoid think

 phiixphical vocabulary 

ing of matter when we wish to think of figure 
only and sensible diagrams are even put before 
us but in framing or following the reasoning 
we can attend so little to what is material as not 
to be at all disturbed thereby in our calculations 
i have then a notion of a mathematical line 
triangle circle c and a notion sufficiently clear 
to conduct me through the longest chain of rea 
soning without any confusion and what more 
cani wishf 

but if such points lines and circles c 
exist not in any material object and if spirit he 
altogether inconsistent with extension and figure 
can these points unes and circles be said to 
exist at all and if not is the science purely 
imaginary the only answer to this is that if 
space can be said to exist then do the figures of 
geometry they rest upon the same foundation 
they must stand or fall together and if space 
and time be not imaginary neither is the science 
of mathematics surely no one will say that the 
terms space and time have either no meaning 
at all or mean what exists only in fancy as the 
words centaur mermaid the same exactly may 
be said of the lines and figures of geometry 
that these terms have a meaning is evident for 
otherwise how could we reason about them 
and if they have a meaning then we have notions 



quantity 

corresponding to them for these are but di£ferent 
phrases for the same thing and will any one 
pretend that those notions are fanciful like the 
notions of centaur and mermaid we have 
then notions and notions which are not fantastic 
what more can we desire for truth 

with all respect for the abilities of the above 
mentioned author i cannot but think that his 
doctrine with respect to necessary truths is 
fundamentally erroneous certain it is that phi 
losophers have long made a distinction between 
necessary and contiient truth a distinction 
which mr mill would confound hume clearly 
marked out the di£ference under the names of 
relations of ideas and matters of fact the latter 
known by experience the former not dr 
wheweirs account of this as quoted by mr mill 
is as follows necessary truths are those in 
which we not only learn that the proposition is 
true but see that it must be true in which the 
negative of the truth is not only false but im 
possible in which we cannot even by an effort 
of imagination or in a supposition conceive the 
reverse of that which is asserted that there 
are such truths cannot be doubted we may 
take for example all relations of number three 
and two added together make five we cannot 
conceive it to be otherwise we cannot by any 



 philosophical vocabulary 

freak of thought imagine three and two to make 
seven 

from this passage mr mill deduces that ac 
cording to dr whewell a necessary truth may 
be defined to be a proposition the negative of 
which is not only false but inconceivable start 
ing from this idea mr mill goes on to show 
that as the power of conception depends very 
much upon association and as many things 
formerly supposed inconceivable are now not 
only conceived but believed for instance the 
action of bodies on each other at a distance of 
matter on mind c he thence infers that incon 
ceivability of the contrary is a very poor test of 
truth and that what is called necessary truth 
rests like every other solely on experience 

is there then no difference in the evidence on 
which these two propositions rest the sun will 
rise tomorrow the three angles of a triangle 
are equal to two right angles are they both 
contingent or both necessary do they both rest 
upon experience consult your own mind why 
do we believe that the sun will rise tomorrow 
because as far as i know personally or can learn 
from the testimony of others alive or dead it 
always has in time past but can you see in that 
any irresistible reason why it should rise to

day ere you can say positively it mil not your 
knowledge must be far far more extended than it 
is at present it must approximate to the know 
ledge of him who created the sun and all things 
but why do you believe that the three angles of 
a triangle are equal to two right angles because 
i have seen it demonstrated that is starting 
from some selfevident truth i have followed a 
chain of reasoning each link of which was an 
irresistible inference from the preceding until i 
arrived at the conclusion which was the last 
irresistible inference the demonstration finished 
i can no more doubt the truth in question than 
i can doubt the existence of that feeling of 
which at the moment i am conscious i see 
clearly that the conclusion holds good and always 
will hold good in short that it must be true 

but how do you know that all i can answer 
is that i see it to be so i assert that to me the 
first proposition is selfevident and that the in 
ferences flow from it irresistibly even to the con 
clusion if you deny this i can only bid you to 
study the theorem should you still persist in 
your doubts i can say no more for i cannot give 
a demonstration of a demonstration what is 



 philosophical vocabulary 

selfevident not only requires no proof but ad 
mits of none and if the inferences from the first 
proposition be not directly felt to be irresistible 
no arguments remain to make them so 

having read and mentally followed the theorem 
in which the above conclusion is established 
can any man doubt its truth if he cannot 
then the truth is necessary not contingent and 
if he cannot doubt its truth then is it not derived 
from experience for experience tells us only of 
the past and we can always doubt whether what 
we have experienced in the past shall happen 
again 

if this be correct it is absurd to ask for any 
test of selfevidence or of demonstrative inference 
you either see it or you do not a necessary 
truth is that which is either evident at once or 
becomes so by means of a demonstration the 
criterion is not that the opposite is a contradic 
tion in terms for i see no contradiction in sup 
posing previous to enquiry that the three angles 
of a triangle are greater or less than two right 
angles no contradiction to the definition of 
triangle it is not as if i said that black is white 
neither is inconceivability of the contrary a cri 
terion for beforehand i can just as well conceive 
that those three angles are unequal as equal to 
two right angles but dr whewell having made 



quantity 

use of the word conceive mr mill has founded 
thereon a supposed refutation of the doctrine 
that there are truths necessary truths which 
we know for certain but not from experience 
no doubt when truths are seen to be necessary 
the contrary is inconceivable but it is not be 
cause they may be inconceivable that we deem 
them necessary 

when we say that a truth is necessary we 
imply that the contrary is impossible the one in 
volves the other and if we require a criterion of 
necessity so do we of impossibility but neither 
admits of any that can be stated in words the 
mind alone supplies it 

the distinctions between quantity and quality 
may be here summed up 

 quality varies by insensible shades or de 
grees whereas one quantity differs from another 
by a fixed or determinate difference 

 quality generally but not always admits 
of a contrary as black is the contrary of white 
wetness of dryness hardness of softness vice of 
virtue ugliness of beauty but quantity has 
never a contrary one quantity may be double 
triple four times another quantity but in all 
these there is no opposition but only more or 
less of the same thing 

 qualities are like or unlike but quanti 

e 



 philosophical vocabulary 

ties are equal or unequal this last distinction 
however is comprehended under the first for 
where the degrees of difference are insensible 
there will be likeness or unlikeness and where 
the diflferences are fixed there will be equality or 
inequality 



relation 



relation 

in treating of quality we have been led un 
avoidably to mention relation but this word 
now demands a separate head 

in classifying the phenomena of mind rela 
tions are opposed to conceptions and they are 
thus distinguished conceptions being those in 
ward phenomena which do not necessarily imply 
or at least do not evidently imply the existence 
of two things while relations do manifestly sup 
pose more things than one i look at a horse pre 
sent before me and admire his form colour and 
activity without thinking of any other horse and 
i have a perception of him which in his absence 
may suggest a conception i consider him along 
with a pony and i compare them in other words 
i am conscious of a relation between them and 
this state of mind which i experience is quite dis 
tinct from the perception or the conception either 
of the horse or of the pony though but for those 
it never would have arisen it is a state more 
removed from sensation in the order of time 
than either perception or conception of which it 
is the consequence 



 philosophical yocabulary 

so far the distinction between conception 
and relation seems very clearly marked though 
when we examine the matter more deeply we 
shall find that there are but very few concep 
tions which do not at least imply that is suppose 
in a covert way the existence of more things 
than one thus all the qualities of substances 
even those which we have called simple as op 
posed to relative suppose not only that there is 
an outward or material object but also a per 
cipient mind a blue object is one which rouses 
in me the sensation which i call blueness and 
therefore there is a relation between that object 
and myself still there is a difierence between 
this case and that of a relation commonly so 
called a di£ference on which we have enlarged 
in treating of quality besides the more com 
plex nature of the relation in the latter case it 
is also manifestly i whereas in the former it is 
discovered only by those who study the subject 
metaphysically no one generally speaking 
when looking at a green field thinks of the field 
then of his sensation and lastly of the relation 
between them it would be a bad use of meta 
physical subtlety to confound distinctions re 
cognized by the common sense as well as the 
common language of all mankind the words 
blueness redness hardness softness wetness 



relation 

dryness suggest no relation to ordinary men 
but those of father mother brother sister 
cousin tutor governor servant slave cannot be 
heard by any one without calling up the notion 
of two persons somehow connected a relation 
then considered as a mental phenomenon is an 
inward state of mind which manifestly supposes 
the existence of two things at least having some 
thing in common and according to the nature 
of that something there are dififerent kinds of 
relations 

but do relations exist only as mental phe 
nomena have they no existence outwardly 

objects there are we allow having an indepen 
dent existence without but it would be palpable 
nonsense to say that a relation exists as matter 
exists that it is however something more 
than a mere state of mind every one is con 
vinced when i think of a mare and her foal i 
am conscious that there exists a connection be 
tween them the nature of which every dolt 
knows as well as the wisest of men consisting of 
a long series of material changes in which the 
two participate but if you ask me to put my 
finger on the relation as on a lump of matter 
then i am quite at a loss i must allow that the re 
lation exists not as the mare and her foal exist — 
objects which can be seen and touched must 



 philosophical vocabulary 

i then be driven to confess that the relation be 
tween them is a mere state of my mind but this 
conclusion is as opposed to the universal sense of 
mankind as the other how then can the rela 
tion exist if it be neither material merely nor men 
tal merely this is a question which i will 
answer when any one shall inform me how space 
and time exist 

having explained as far as we are able 
the nature of relation let us see what are the 
different kinds thereof 

there is one distinction among relations which 
is very well marked some relations suppose the 
things related to exist simultaneously or together 
others imply that they exist in succession con 
sequently the latter do and the former do not 
necessarily involve the notion of time we have 
therefore relations of coexistence and rela 
tions of succession these always supposing time 
while those may or may not suppose space ac 
cording as the objects related are outward and 
material or inward and mental the following 
are the principal relations of coexistence 

 relations of position i stand on a moun 
tain commanding an extensive prospect i descry 
hills dales woods towers steeples i remark 
how they lie one with another east west north 
or south some nearer some farther oflf some 



relation 

above some below and i am conscious that they 
are related in space related by position this 
relation is the foundation or subject of geography 
and descriptire astronomy of zoology so far as 
the mere collocation of parts as known by 
anatomy is concerned of botany also to a con 
siderable extent and of geology likewise in part 
one object of which is to determine the relative 
position of strata 

 relations of comprehension i look down 
from the top of st pauls and i see a vast city 
which in a certain sense i consider one but which 
embraces or contains within it an immense num 
ber of treets squares houses churches c and 
i am conscious of a relation between the whole 
and the parts between things existing in space 
a relation of comprehension this is the subject 
of all those sciences which are properly called 
analytic or which investigate the constitution of 
things such as analytic chymistry which searches 
after the hidden ingredients of material objects 
and analytic metaphysics though in this case the 
things related viz the compound feeling and 
the simple feelings which it comprises cannot be 
said to have any existence in space 

 relations of quantity quantity being 
as we have seen that which hath parts and which 
may be increased or diminished without limit by 



 philosophical vocabulilrt 

adding or subtracting parts it would seem to fou 
low that as in this sense both time and space 
have quantity therefore the relations of quan 
tity ought to be classed some as coexisting others 
as successive but in reality it is not so as for 
the theorems of pure geometry these are evidently 
concerned with the relations of things in space 
for they may be represented to the eye though 
with some imperfection and though the num 
bers of arithmetic and the letters of algebra may 
apply to the divisions of time as well as of space 
yet while making our calculations while feeling 
the relations in question the quantities are sup 
posed to coexist while we are conscious that 
 all these numbers exist together 
and though we may afterwards insert the word 
himrs and say that hours hours 
hours hours yet this insertion cannot change 
the nature of a relation previously felt 

relations of quantity then and the science 
of those relations viz pure mathematics do 
not in any case involve the notion of time 

 since writing the above i am glad to find my opinion con 
firmed by that of mr mill the laws of number says he 
 are common to synchronous and successive phenomena again 
 the laws of number though true of successive phenomena do 
not relate to their succession see mills system of logic 
book iii chap 



relation 

 relations of indeterminate degree i look 
upon two tulips and pronounce one to be more 
gaudy than another upon two geraniums and 
perceive that the one has the more brilliant co 
lours upon two horses a racer and a cart horse 
and am conscious that the former is the more 
finely formed upon two women and am sensi 
ble that the one is much more beautiful than the 
other 

so i partake of two loaves of bread and am 
aware that they are of different degrees of good 
ness or of different qualities as the phrase is 

all these are relations of indeterminate de 
gree for by what standard can we measure them 
we may be sure that one thing surpasses an 
other in brilliancy of colour in beauty in taste 
or in nutritive power but who can say how 
much the qualities or properties compared 
must of course be similar for between different 
qualities as between colour and taste beauty and 
nutritive power there can be no comparison 
true it is that the word quality is sometimes 
used to signify degree as when we speak of 
different qualities of bread or meat meaning 
different degrees of goodness as to taste and 
nutrition and in this sense diverse qualities or 
degrees may be compared but this is a popular 
not a philosophical sense of the word and as 

f 



 philosophical vocabulary 

the word degree is often used to express relations 
of quantity as in the ease of the degrees of a 
thermometer therefore it is necessary to distin 
guish the relation now in question by the phrase 
indeterminate degree 

in popular language the word quality in the 
sense of degree is very commonly opposed to 
quantity as when we say that the food of the 
poor is both deficient in quantity and bad in 
quality that is inferior either in taste or in 
nutritive power to the food consumed by the rich 
but we must be careful not to confound this sense 
of the word quality with the philosophical one 
in the philosophical sense different qualities or 
properties as taste and nutritive power cannot 
be compared together but in the popular sense 
different qualities may be compared because 
quality then signifies degree of a common pro 
perty as the degree of excellence in food as to 
the common property taste or else as to nutri 
tive power 

here we again see the difference between 
quality in the strict or philosophical sense and 
quantity the former admitting of relations of 
indeterminate degree and of those only the 
latter of relations only of determinate degree 
this distinction is of the utmost importance as 
it at once separates mathematics or the science 



relation 

of quantity as susceptible of demonstration and 
certainty from all other sciences which admit 
only of probability 

some dualities are much more determinate 
than others thus justice is much more so than 
any other duty and consequently the science of 
law is the most exact department of moral philo 
sophy 

these four are perhaps the only orders of 
relations which are always between things co 
existent the second class or relations of suc 
cession is divided into two orders according as 
the sequence is invariable or casual the former 
is the important relation of cause and effect 
which will be treated at length by and by 

how important to philosophy is a right notion 
of cause and effect may be judged from the fact 
that this is the object of philosophy properly so 
called as distinguished from simple science 
and what wandering in the dark do we find 
among philosophers from not knowing what they 
were seeking to trace the sequences of cause 
and effect is one object but to mount up to 
general causes or principles is the highest scope 
of philosophy the whole is comprised in two 
words — causation and generalization 

the second order of successive relations is that 
of casual succession one of little importance be 



s philosophical vocabulary 

cause as the name implies it cannot be calculated 
or foretold 

but though not important in itself it has never 
theless been the occasion of most of the errors in 
philosophy as well as in daily life as i have 
elsewhere observed so great is the tendency to 
connect things as cause and effect that with 
children and ignorant adults one instance of 
sequence is enough to create the belief of invaria 
bility and nothing but a wider experience can 
correct this tendency there is perhaps not a 
man however experienced who does not still 
make such mistakes though certainly he will 
not believe that tenterden church steeple was 
the cause of the goodwin sands because it was 
built just before their appearance we must not 
confound casual succession with accident for 
the latter implies a real sequence of cause and 
effect but one which could not have been fore 
told owing to the great complication of causes in 
the world and our ignorance of most of them 
whereas in casual succession there is no con 
nection of the kind between the two events no 
more than between tenterden and goodwin 
the one simply precedes and the other follows 
on a single occasion and that is all and ten 
thousand things as well as the one in question 
may have preceded the latter how many events 



relation 

must have immediately gone before my act of 
writing these lines on paper 

besides these two classes of relations the 
coexistent and the successive there seems to 
be a third class comprising relations some of 
which are coexistent and others successive this 
may be called the mixed class to it belongs 
but one order exceedingly comprehensive the 
relations of resemblance 

resemblance may be felt either between things 
coexistent as between two horses or two sheep 
placed side by side or between two sequences of 
phenomena as when two billiard balls are each 
impelled by another or as when two salts are 
produced in the one case by mixing sulphuric 
acid with potash in another muriatic acid with 
soda here not only the products of the chemi 
cal action are alike in some important particulars 
but the actions themselves are very similar so 
we say that there is a striking resemblance be 
tween the revolutionary changes which took place 
in england in the seventeenth century and those 
which occurred in france in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth meaning not only that the results 
were alike but that the events succeeded each 
other in a like order 

no relation is more generally felt than that of 
resemblance though we frequently say of two 



 philosophical vocabulary 

things that they are not the least alike yet this 
is only in comparison with others that are more 
like for strictly speaking almost all things have 
something in common some one point at least 
of resemblance 

to determine important resemblances is one 
grand object of science all classification is 
founded on resemblance and in many sciences 
classification is everything when we shall have 
classified all the objects of the animal vegetable 
and mineral kingdoms according to their resem 
blances descriptive natural history will be com 
plete in mental science also classification of 
the phenomena of mind is an important part 
but more than this all our reasonings from ex 
perience all induction as it is commonly called 
is founded on this same relation for the funda 
mental axiom of inductive reasoning is that 
nature is uniform in her operations that like 
causes will be followed by like effects and that 
things which have constantly coexisted will 
always coexist for instance that a creature 
having the outward appearance of a man will 
always have a heart liver lungs c formed like 
other men whom we have actually examined 
the grand object of inquiry then becomes to 
detect in any new case sufficient similarity with 
an old case that is sufficient to warrant us in in 



relation 

ferring similar coexistence of things or similar 
succession of phenomena without actual obser 
vation resemblance then and causation are 
relations of the utmost importance in science 
and philosophy 

it seems scardely necessary to add that the 
study of resemblances belongs as well to the 
poet as to the philosopher how much of the 
charm of the fine arts depends upon the likeness 
between their creations and those of nature 
and are not the finest parts of poetry the 
similes for the sake of beauty a simile must 
be neither very near nor very far fetched for 
in the one case it is indifferent in the other 
ludicrous a simile scientifically correct would 
be about as bad in poetry as one that is absurd 

 relations of resemblance may be considered either as a 
class distinct from those of coexistence and those of sucession 
or the resemblances of coexistence may be looked upon as an 
order of the former class and resemblances of succession as an 
order of the latter this however would be not at all a logical 
arrangement for then we should separate the species of the genus 
resemblance and place them under different classes 



 phitphical vocabulary 



powee cause and effect 

though we have made mention of cause and 
effect under the head of relation yet as this is 
the most important of all relations and probably 
the least understood it seems necessary to con 
sider it now at large under a separate head 

power is the word which expresses that pe 
culiar relation which a cause bears to its effect 
the nature of which we are now to investigate 
what then is the notion which we actually have 
of power 

in the first place it is evident that by cause 
we mean something which precedes something 
else which something else we call effect the 
relation between them then or power is a rela 
tion of antecedence and consequence in other 
words of succession involving the notion of 
time and the order of this succession is uni 
form the cause being the antecedent the effect 
always the consequent but ten thousand things 
may precede any change only one of which we 
look upon as the cause of that change there 
fore a cause is not a mere antecedent an effect 
not a mere consequent 



power cause and effect 

when we have determined the cause of any 
phenomenon we believe that it will be followed 
by that efifect not only once not only several 
times not only most times but always and if per 
chance we be deceived and at any time the cause 
appear without the effect we draw one or the 
other of the following conclusions either we 
were altogether wrong in the supposed cause or 
the one now before us differs in some respect 
from that which we formerly observed or 
what is nearly the same thing there are other 
counteracting causes at work which we wot not 
of but however we may account for the 
failure of the effect we never for a moment sup 
pose that there is any want of uniformity in 
nature or that causes really alike in all respects 
will not always be followed by like effects a 
man who should hazard such an opinion would 
be considered out of his mind so far then we 
tread upon indisputable ground and we can 
pronounce without doubt that power involves 
the notion of invariable antecedence and in 
variable consequence 

but is this the whole of the relation as 
some philosophers assert particularly thomas 
brown that acute metaphysician treading 
in the steps of hume wrote a book to prove 
that all we know or ever can know of cause 

g 



 philosophical vocabulabt 

and effect is that the one invariably precedes 
the other invariably follows events as hume 
observed are conjoined but as far as we can 
trace unconnected nothing seems to bind 
them together they succeed each other some 
invariably others casually but we never can 
say why any order prevails why fire warms 
or cold freezes why acids and alkalis combine 
to form salts pursue your investigation as far 
as you can says brown try and find out some 
connection between any cause and its effect 
and if you seem to succeed what will you have 
learnt simply this that between the two there 
is a link if we may so call it formerly unknown 
a change previously undiscovered so that instead 
of a followed immediately by c we have a 
followed by b followed by c a sequence more 
full but merely a sequence and quite as incom 
prehensible as before the only difference is 
that a is no longer considered the invariable 
and immediate antecedent of c but simply an 
invariable antecedent while it is the immediate 
and invariable antecedent of b 

this doctrine may be true but it must be al 
lowed that it sounds strange in the ears of untu 
tored men and at first at least appears unsatisfac 
tory to all that a cause is something more than 
an invariable antecedent an effect than an in 



foweb cause and effect 

variable consequent we cannot help believing 
though what it can be may transcend our limited 
intelligence but if the above be the only defi 
nite notion of power which we possess we ought 
not to find fault with the doctrine because it 
openly acknowledges our ignorance is it how 
ever certain that we have no other notion of 
power the general sense of mankind would 
induce us to think that we have for these who 
cannot refute the above doctrine are still unsatis 
fied and though silenced are not convinced but 
where interest or passion does not intervene 
truth though long undiscovered when once 
pointed out is apt to seize upon the mind with 
the force of intuition this is particularly the 
case with metaphysical truth which is known to 
us ultimately by consciousness to the mind of 
each individual must we appeal as to the highest 
tribunal in all questions relative to mental phi 
losophy and this tribunal seems to decide that 
the above doctrine of cause and effect is not 
altogether satisfactory 

this general consideration may make us 
suspect the doctrine of brown but to refute 
it some definite objection is necessary and 
this objection has been furnished by reid 
who remarks that if a cause be merely an 
invariable antecedent an effect an invariable con 



 philosophical vocabulary 

sequent then as no two events have more con 
stantly succeeded each other than day and night 
night and day it will follow that day is the 
cause of the succeeding night night the cause of 
the succeeding day nor does it seem easy to 
answer this ohjection it is quite conceivable 
that a common cause or union of causes as in 
this case the existence and fixity of the sun com 
bined with the rotation of the earth may give 
rise to a series of changes succeeding each other 
invariably though unconnected as cause and 
effect the very power of conceiving such an 
occurrence proves that there is no inconsistency 
in the notion of invariable succession without 
causation and here we produce a case where 
such a succession actually takes place we must 
then conclude that the doctrine of hume and 
brown as to cause and efifect is to say the least 
incomplete that invariable antecedence belongs 
to a cause invariable consequence to an effect is 
undoubtedly true but it is not the whole truth 
mankind seem to be generally convinced that 
there is what they call a necessary connection be 
tween cause and effect but what is meant by 
this phrase the only sense which i can here 
attach to the word necessary is that of indispen 
sable when we say that the truths of mathe 
matics are necessary we mean either that they 



power cause and effect 

are selfevident or that they follow irresistibly 
by reasoning from selfevident truths this ne 
cessity the mind sees intimately it sees that the 
truths are not contingent not liable to change 
now or hereafter unchangeable even by omnipo 
tence the same can be said of no matters of 
fact the world and all that it inherits may 
change in the twinkling of an eye for aught that 
we can see to the contrary and therefore in this 
sense of necessity we can see no necessary con 
nection between any two successive events 
this however we do find out by experience that 
in the present state of existence at any rate and 
until some grand change shall ensue certain 
events are indispensable to certain others in 
other words unless the former occur the latter 
will not follow the one we call cause the other 
effect and we say that the one has power to 
produce the other meaning that it is an indis 
pensable condition of its existence a cause 
then is not a mere invariable antecedent but it 
is an invariable and indispensable antecedent 
and as the word indispensable evidently includes 
invariability and something more the word in 
variable becomes unnecessary and we may define 
a cause to be an indispensable antecedent an 
effect an unavoidable consequent 

having determined the nature of cause and 



 philosophical vocabulary 

effect in general that is to say the general notion 
which we have of the relation between them it 
remains to be seen whether causes may not be 
divided into different species aristotle mentions 
four kinds of causes — the material the formal 
the efficient and the final but we need not 
long be detained with these for most of them 
would not now be regarded as causes at all 

what he calls the material cause is the sub 
stance of which a thing is made as the material 
cause of a silver spoon is the metal silver and 
if the substance be a compound one as brass 
then the material causes thereof are the simple 
bodies or elements in this case copper and zinc 
this then is not a cause in our sense of the 
word again the formal cause as the ancients 
understood it is purely imaginary and the 
final cause is properly not a cause but an effect 
which we see an useful effect the foresight of 
which as we presume induced the great creator 
to provide means suitable to the end in view 
it is only as offering a motive to the mind of the 
deity that an end in view an effect anticipated 
becomes a cause of the four causes of aristotle 

 these four causes were very neatly expressed in greek by 
four prepositions the material cause was the i oi out of 
which the formal the a o according to which the effi 
cient the vqoi by which and the final the ia o for which 



power cause and effect 

there remains then only the efficient which we 
should recognise as such the principle of motion 
the inxlispensable antecedent of any change 

the first and most obvious division of causes 
is that into immediate and remote since causes 
form a lengthened chain reaching from visible 
eflfects up to the great first cause it follows 
that some are nearer to the efifect others farther 
oflf properly speaking there is but one immediate 
cause and all the others are remote though in 
different degrees 

often do two men differ as to the causes of 
any phenomenon but both may be right for the 
cause hit upon by the one may be more remote 
than that assigned by the other and each may 
exist in its order thus while some maintain 
that value and price are regulated by the demand 
and supply others insist that cost of production 
is the determining cause nor is there here any 
real opposition for cost of production regulates 
the demand and supply and these again regulate 
price 

causes are also divided into proximate and 
ultimate judging by etymology or the deriva 
tion of the words we might suppose that proxi 
mate and ultimate mean exactly the same thing 
as immediate and remote and such is the un 
certainty in the use of words that we cannot 



 philosophical vocabulary 

affirm that they never are so employed but 
generally speaking the sense is very different 
for immediate qxid remote refer to the real order 
of succession of phenomena in causation one 
after another whereas proximate and ultimate 
relate to the order according to which we arrive 
at the knowledge of causes thus proximate 
corresponds to palpable or apparent ultimate to 
hidden or real for the real causes of change 
are not always manifest often far otherwise 
being enveloped and so hidden from view by 
masses of inert matter as a remedy for ague 
the value of bark was known for ages but of late 
years only has it been discovered that the whole 
virtue resides in a very small portion of the mass 
in a substance that can be separated from the 
rest and which is called quinine so the whole 
narcotic virtue of opium has been found to reside 
in morphia and the poisoning property of nux 
vomica in the alkali strychnia and bark opium 
and the nux vomica are the proximate or pal 
pable causes quinine morphia and strycknia the 
ultimate hidden or real causes 

proximate and ultimate then refer not to the 
order of succession among the phenomena of 
causation but to the order in which we discover 
them the compound substance bark is not 
nearer in time to the effect viz the cure of 



power cause and effect 

ague than is the simpler substance quinine but 
the whole eflfect as we find by experience is 
owing to the latter and the former deprived of 
this contributes nothing if anything the woody 
matter rather hinders than promotes the good 
result bark is indeed still a cure for ague but 
it is so only because it contains the alkali 
quinine the rest is merely the covering of the 
real cause the garment which conceals it from 
view 

the grand object of philosophy mental or 
physical is to trace ultimate causes to ascend 
to them as the phrase is from the proximate and 
palpable causes which lie upon the flat before us 
it is therefore of the utmost consequence clearly 
to understand their nature this it is hoped 
will in part appear from the above remarks the 
examples derived from chemistry are particularly 
valuable as illustrations because the proximate 
and ultimate causes of change can there be ac 
tually exhibited as substances but it is not so in 
all sciences very frequently the ultimate causes 
of change are not substances but tendencies 
tendencies inseparable from mind or matter but 
not to be seen or felt and known only from the 
result thus we attribute the motion of the 
earth round the sun to two tendencies at present 
supposed ultimate a projectile rectilinear or tan 



 phxuieophjcal vocabulary 

gential force and the force of gravity these 
tendencies being given we can from their union 
account for the motion of the earth as their 
common result though the latter only is strictly 
proved the former being only hypothetical 

whatever may be the point which we have 
reached in the progress of our enquiry whether 
the causes already discovered be the most general 
and simple that can be traced by man or not for 
the time at least they are ultimate causes like 
those fifty or sixty bodies which chemists call 
simple because they have never been analyzed 
but is it not often said that man can discover 
proximate causes only ultimate being beyond his 
ken when this is asserted it must mean that 
the deity is not only the great first the original 
or remote cause of the phenomena of the uni 
verse but also the real or ultimate cause of 
every event that nothing takes place not only 
without his permission but without his direct 
agency 

this may be the case and it may be that god 
is thus the one ultimate or real cause of every 
change but the question is clearly beyond the 
sphere of human intellect and whatever opinion 
we may adopt on this point we are justified in 
distinguishing between those causes which lie 
more open to view and those more hidden and 



poweb cause anp bffrct 

speakiug comparatively we may call the former 
proximate the latter ultimate though these may 
not be strictly such not ultimate even to our 
limited capabilities but so only provisionally 

the words proximate and ultimate as here 
explained exactly correspond in meaning with 
the use of them in analytic chemistry what 
are called the proximate principles of any com 
pound are those constituent parts which meet us 
first in the order of analysis they being them 
selves compounded of the ultimate principles or 
elements and much more like to the compound 
than are those elements thus the proximate 
principles of animal substances — of muscle cel 
lular tissue serous membranes nerves blood 
lymph c are found to be fibrin gelatin gluten 
c all which principles are made up chiefly if 
not entirely of four elements — carbon oxygen 
hydrogen and nitrogen or azote in different 
proportions 

another division of causes is that into pri 
mary and secondary as immediate and remote 
relate to the real order of succession and proxi 
mate and ultimate to the natural order of 
discovery so primary and secondary refer to 
the order of importance since few if any 
events are owing to one cause alone a dis 
tinction is made according to the degree in 



 philophical vocabulary 

which causes are supposed to contribute to 
wards the common result and one is called 
primary while others are styled secondary or 
auxiliary in this sense gibbon professedly uses 
the term secondary in his celebrated chapter on 
the propagation of christianity though the 
writer insidiously endeavours to instil into his 
readers that his five causes were sufficient to 
account for the marvellous effect that in short 
they were primary not secondary causes since 
secondary causes are often subsequent in the 
order of time to the primary they may be at 
once auxiliary and immediate and the word 
secondary may be sometimes used in one sense 
sometimes in the other being now opposed to 
primary or principal now to remote or original 
thus when we talk of the secondary causes of 
moral sentiment we may mean to distinguish 
them from primary in the sense of original or 
in the sense of principal or chief and as the 
same causes which are secondary in the one sense 
are so likewise in the other neither the reader 
nor the writer may be always aware in which 
sense the word is used the original causes of 
moral sentiment which are also the most impor 
tant are certain tendencies deeply and indelibly 
seated in the human mind whereas the se 
condary or subsequent causes which are likewise 



poler canb and effect 

of less consequence are such fluctuating circum 
stances as education passion local utility c 
the word circumstance is commonly used to ex 
press a secondary or auxiliary cause which along 
with others of the same sort is supposed as it 
were to stand around the primary or principal 
cause 

what is called an occasion is nothing but a 
secondary or auxiliary cause thus i say that 
it was on occasion of my being in london that i 
went to see the british museum meaning that 
this circumstance went along with the principal 
cause which undoubtedly was my desire to see 
the curiosities therein contained but had this 
desire been very strong i might have gone up to 
london on purpose so we pray against all 
 occasions of evil that is all outward circum 
stances which may help to stir up the great source 
of mischief — our own bad propensities 

an opportunity is also an auxiliary cause 
one that facilitates the acquisition of any object 
which we are supposed to have previously desired 
the keener the desire the quicker generally is 
the intellect in seeing opportunities and the 
greater the readiness in seizing upon them the 
grand art of life is that of perceiving and profiting 
by opportunities ideas come again convictions 
perpetuate themselves opportunities never recur 



 philoflophicaii vogabulabt 

there is another distinction which deserves to 
he mentioned one dwelt upon chiefly hy medical 
writers viz the division of causes into predis 
ponent and exciting 

two men go out together and are exposed to 
the same weather with the same precautions or 
want of precautions both get wet to the skin 
return home and both immediately change or 
not as the case may be but the one catches only 
a slight cold and the other falls ill and dies of 
consumption here medical men would say that 
the one had the seeds of consumption undeveloped 
in his frame before he was exposed to the exciting 
causes of cold and wet the other not or that the 
former was predisposed to that fatal malady and 
assuredly there are great diversities of constitu 
tion — original tendencies to different diseases in 
different persons or we never could account for 
the diverse effects of the same outward causes 
but those tendencies may be long hidden or even 
may never be known in the absence of any out 
ward or exciting cause as a consumptive habit 
may never actually fall into consumption if fatigue 
cold and wet be carefully avoided therefore 
the division of causes into predisposing and ex 
citing is not only very useful as a guide to the 
medical practitioner but it may lay claim to no 
small degree of philosophical accuracy 



law 



law 

what is a law 

a law in its most general sense means a 
general rule proceeding from an intelligent being 
now laws are of two sorts— speculative and 
practical speculative laws often called the 
laws of nature are those general rules or plans 
which we suppose to have been present to the 
mind of the deity or great first cause before 
he formed the universe and according to which 
he afterwards did form the same to us these 
laws are in the first instance merely an object of 
speculation though the knowledge of them may 
subsequently be turned to the most important 
practical purposes to discover these laws is the 
grand object of natural and mental philosophy 

when we talk of the laws which govern the uni 
verse or any department of the universe we must 
remember that though in one point of view these 
laws are causes yet in another they are themselves 
effects and therefore requiring explanation quite 
as much as the phenomena which they help to 
explain therefore these laws only remove the 
difficulty a few steps and to a great selfexistent 
cause we must have recourse at last laws then 



 philosophical vocadulary 

after all are but gods deputies and their 
government is only delegated 

a praeticarlaw on the other hand is a general 
rule proceeding from an intelligent being or 
beings whereby something is commanded to be 
done or not to be done under the sanction of 
reward or punishment this law may be written 
or unwritten expressed or understood partial or 
universal temporary or eternal practical laws 
are also divided into the ethical and the political 

in an ethical law or as some call it a natural 
law because the knowledge of it is obtained by 
the use of natural i e our common or ordinary 
faculties without any peculiar study the rule is 
supposed to proceed from all men or what comes 
to the same thing from god for whatever is 
held by all men at all times must be derived from 
unchangeable principles of human nature which 
we must suppose implanted in us on purpose by 
him the rule then which here is a command 
proceeds from all men or from god and the 
sanction is fear of punishment or hope of reward 
from man or from god from man individually 
not from men united in a body politic or common 
wealth the principal sanction of man indi 
vidually is approbation or disapprobation moral 
love or moral indignation and their consequences 

 for a further account of law of nature see next article 



law 

these laws may admit of some modifications 
according to times and circumstances but no fur 
ther than the nature of man himself for whose use 
they are framed is liable to change as compared 
with those which follow they may therefore be 
called immutable and eternal 

a political law is a general rule whereby the 
sovereign of a state or commonwealth commands or 
forbids something under the sanction of reward or 
punishment laws of this sort may vary very 
widely according to the will of the sovereign either 
in the same country at diflferent times or in 
different countries at the same time though it 
follows directly from what is above said that a 
political ought never to be contrary to an ethical 
law 

 the term political m here need means the law of the state in 
general and compnses not only oonstitutional or organic law but 
the criminal as well as what is particularly called the civil law 
all laws in short made by the governing power of a state i call 
political

law of nature 

explanation of phenomena 

few phrases are more used in philosophy and 
few are more imperfectly comprehended than law 
of nature this then requires a separate article 

a law of nature may be defined to be a 
general eject or tendency to an effect of which 
the cause is unknown 

from this it follows that a law cannot be ex 
plained it can only be stated not accounted for 
but this general effect or tendency must in the 
course of nature be a cause of other phenomena 
and consequently though itself unaccountable it 
may serve to explain other things 

there is then no absurdity in assigning a law 
in explanation of any phenomenon for though in 
one view it is an effect inexplicable in another it is 
a cause nay a law is the ultimate explanation 
of any phenomenon in other words the ultimate 
cause so far as we know the most simple and 
general that can be pointed out by us always 
excepting the first great cause of all which alone 
is really ultimate once more to explain a 
phenomenon is to assign the cause thereof but 
the cause first observed may be only proximate or 



law of nature 

palpable containing the simple and general or real 
cause along with other things of no moment and 
when we have separated these last we have detached 
the ultimate cause which if it be a tendency 
and not a substance is called a law of nature 
therefore in this sense of the word law explana 
tion by assigning a cause and explanation by 
pointing out a law are not different in kind and 
not opposed but explanation by cause compre 
hends two species explanation by proximate causes 
and explanation by ultimate causes or laws 

a complex effect may be explained by pointing 
out the simple or elementary causes or tendencies 
from what it results as the motion of the earth 
and other planets round the sun is explained on 
the supposition of a rectilinear projectile or 
tangential force combined with the tendency to the 
centre we know that two such tendencies would 
produce such an effect and as we have proofs of 
the one we allow the other but the elementary 
tendencies themselves cannot be explained they can 
only be ascertained to be real and to be generally 
diffused and when a case of them occurs as when 
a stone falls to the ground all we can say is that it 
is a particular instance of a general tendency not 
an isolated fact here we generalize but we do 
not assign a cause these tendencies which can 
not be determined to be the result of more general 



 philoecvhical vocabulary 

causes are sometimes called ultimate facts as 
well as laws and they are properly inexplicable 
i e they cannot be unfolded and shown to be com 
pound results of more simple tendencies such 
are cohesion gravity and the three laws of 
motion 

we have shown that the division of causes into 
immediate and remote differs from that into 
proximate and ultimate accordingly there is 
another way of explaining by causes and instead 
of ascending in the scale of generalization from 
compound and palpable causes to simple and 
concealed we may trace the order of the former 
from the last effect up to the most remote cause 
in other words the sequence of causation thus 
starting from the movement of the hands on the 
dialplate of a watch we may follow the series of 
motions through wheels and other mechanical con 
trivances up to the first power the spring so the 
process of digestion in the animal frame may be 
traced from the mastication of the food in the 
mouth till it is converted into chyme and chyle 
and finally lost in the blood 

but when with a wish to enlarge our knowledge 
we enquire what is the cause of motion in all 
watches or in all clocks we find that in the one 
case the general cause is that tendency in certain 
bodies which we call elasticity in the other gravity 



liaw of natubb 

while as to digestion and nutrition the general 
causes of these results are as yet involved in much 
obscurity though the series of sensible changes 
the uniform sequence of phenomena can be traced 
throughout 

these different modes of explanation agree in 
this that they assign a cause of one sort or another 
but the word explanation is sometimes used when 
no cause at all is pointed out it is so used when 
we profess to account for some effect by means of a 
general law of which it is merely a particular 
instance as when we think to explain the fall of a 
stone by saying that it is owing to gravity this 
is a case of gravity certainly and if so it cannot 
at the same time be the effect thereof but this 
sense of the word explanation is very common in 
works of philosophy though it cannot he considered 
a proper one for it differs essentially from the other 
and so leads to much misconception no doubt 
even in this way of explaining a great truth may be 
enounced for instance that the fall of an apple from 
a tree is an effect not singular in nature but a 
particular case of a tendency common to all matter 
this was the grand generalization of newton to 
explain the tendency itself he supposed the 
existence of a fluid called ether but this conjecture 
has met with little favour and gravity is still an 

 the hypothesis of the existence of elher has been revived of 



 pmlosophical vocabulary 

ultimate and unaccountable fact it is not however 
a barren fact for though itself an effect inexplicable 
it is also a mighty cause which helps to account 
for the more complicated phenomena of the universe 
for the movements of a common clock as well as 
the revolutions of jupiter and uranus 

though newton failed in discovering the whole 
cause of the grand tendency gravitation yet he 
may be considered as having made some approxima 
tion towards it when he determined the circum 
stances which regulate the force of the tendency 
for he proved that the force varies directly as the 
quantity of matter and inversely as the squares of 
the distances therefore the quantity of matter and 
the distance being given the resulting force may be 
determined so far the cause of gravity is known 
and this knowledge may lead to the most important 
discoveries this it was which led adams and le 
verrier to the grand discovery of the new planet 
it was from the perturbations of uranus that those 
profound inquirers not only suspected the existence 
of a planet beyond but even assigned its position 
magnitude and distance from the sun before it was 
seen by mortal eye for those perturbations im 
plied a disturbing force and this force implied as 
the cause a certain quantity of matter at a certain 

late years in order to explain light which upon this supposition 
consists in vibrations of ether 



law of nature 

distance in other words a planet of a determined 
mass removed from uranus by a determined space 

the law of the proportions in which bodies com 
bine or as it is now usually called by chemists 
the atomic theory is another grand instance of a 
general effect or tendency to an efifect of which the 
cause is unknown though an attempt has been 
made to account for that effect also by means of an 
hypothesis to have discovered that when one 
body enters into combination with another in 
different proportions the greater proportions are 
always exact multiples of the smallest was certainly 
a grand step in the science of chemistry but this 
is only a general effect to explain which that is 
to assign a cause for it dalton hit upon atoms as 
newton imagined ether to account for gravitation 

before concluding this article we may remark 
that the phrase law of nature is often employed 
in a more extensive sense than the one here given 
being used to signify any general fact any general 
uniformity of succession whether the cause be 
stated or not or even as it appears any uniformity 
of coexistence thus the laws as they are called 
of kepler tell us nothing concerning causes they 
merely state some general facts with respect to the 
motions of the planets for instance that they move 
in elliptical orbits without pretending to explain 
them these and others similar are sometimes 



 philoaophical vocabulary 

called empirical laws in tiiiis sense the perpetual 
recurrence of day and night of night and day may 
be called a law of nature 

lastly were we to say that it is a law of nature 
that all warm blooded animals have internal lungs 
we should be thought to use no unwarrantable lan 
guage though here we state mere uniformity of 
coexistence without any reference to motion or 
change much less to causation 

it is necessary therefore to bear in mind that 
law law of phenomena and even law of nature 
are frequently used to signify any uniformity 
whether of succession or of coexistence and whether 
a cause be apparent or not 

and we must remember that the word explanation 
is not always used in its proper sense of assigning 
a cause but often where there is generalization only 
where a fact is classed as a particular instance of 
one more general or of a law in its widest sense 
thus when kelper deduced from the observed 
positions of the planets that they move in elliptical 
orbits he mit be said to explain those positions 
though the explanation amounted simply to this 
that the observed positions were particular points of 
the general figure ellipse which embraced them all 

 by dr whewell they are called laws of phenomenay and 
as such are distinguished from the causes of phenomena — see 
 philosophy of the inductive sciences book xi chap 



pbinciple 



principle 

what are we to understand by that word of so 
frequent occurrence principle 

one meaning of principle certainly is a general 
or ultimate catise as when we talk of the principle 
of heat of magnetism of electricity meaning thereby 
the unknown cause of certain wellknown phe 
nomena such as expansion a peculiar sensation 
the attraction of iron a violent shock to the frame 
c so we art wont to talk of the principle of life 
the thinking principle c 

in chemistry the word principle is sometimes 
used in its proper signification of general or ultimate 
cause as when we speak of tannin or the tanning 
principle morphia or the narcotic principle 
quinine or the antifebrile principle in these cases 
we can actually produce the cause as a substance 
and operate therewith 

but in chemistry the word principle is more fre 
quently used in another sense as when we mention 
the proximate principles of animal and vegetable 
fiubstancessuch as gluten gelatin albumen c 
here the word principle means constituent part or 
ingredient j that which serves to make up the more 
compound substances muscle cellular tissue 

k 



 philosophical tocabulary 

and the rest constituent parts or ingredients 
when we can analyze them no further are called 
ultimate principles or elements as the metals 
oxygen hydrogen and chlorine gases 

though these two senses of the word principle 
are not the same yet it is evident that the same sub 
stance may unite the two characteristics that it may 
be at once a cause and a constituent part thus 
morphia is a constituent part of opium and likewise 
the cause of its narcotic efifects so with quinine 
strychnia c which are chemical ingredients of 
bark and nux vomica and also the sources of their 
medical virtues 

in pure metaphysics generally and in moral and 
political sciences very frequently the word principle 
is used in its proper primary or original sense 
thus when montesquieu maintains that virtue is 
the principle of democracies moderation of aris 
tocracies honour of monarchies he means that such 
are the causes which preserve each of these sorts of 
government or which are essential to their pros 
perity and continuance so when we talk of liberty 
activity variety and contrast as principles of human 
happiness we mean that they are general causes of 
the same in a like sense we say that division of 
labour is a principle favourable to the increase of 
wealth the discovery of such principles is the 
highest object of philosophy 



principlb 

but in religion morals and politics principles 
are sometimes distinguished into speculative and 
practical the former relating to the existence of 
things as they are the other to things as they may 
be or ought to be when we say that moral senti 
ment springs from sympathy and reason we state a 
speculative principle but when we affirm that 
moral sentiment ought to be regulated by views of 
farsighted and comprehensive utility we lay down 
a practical principle as it is often called or rule of 
action 

in this case the rule is a moral one that is it 
tends to regulate the emotions so as to produce 
happiness but there may also be rules for directing 
the understanding or logical rules what is 
essential to a rule is that it point out something 
whereby practice may be improved meaning by 
practice not merely outward actions but also the 
play of emotions and likewise the exercise of the 
intellect 

a rule then acts or is intended to act either on 
the understanding or the emotions pr rather on the 
understanding always in the first instance and then 
if it be a moral rule on the emotions 

in this sense principle is not synonymous with 
general cause but with general reason and as 
all rules are stated in the form of general pro 
positions a practical principle or rule may be 
defined to be — 



 philosophical vocabulary 



fc 



a general proposition intended to direct the 
understanding j or the emotions or hath 

in this sense we talk of a man of liberal prin 
ciples or of religious principles meaning that the 
rules which direct his understanding his emotions 
and probably his actions are of the kind designated 
by these epithets 

sometimes any general proposition supposed to 
be pregnant with consequences is called a principle 
thus locke begins his essay with an account of 
what he calls speculative principles such as it is 
impossible for the same thing to be and not to be 
but the proper name is axiom in a like sense the 
major premiss of a syllogism according to arch 
bishop whately is sometimes called the principled 

this meaning of the word as well as the pre 
ceding seem to have arisen from a supposed 
analogy between the relation of a general cause to 
its particular eflfects and that of a general proposi 
tion to the particular conclusions that may be drawn 
from it but these are very dififerent relations and 
the use of the same word to express both is apt to 
lead to great confusion 

from the above detail it appears that the word 
principle may mean either an ultimate cause or a 

 elements of logic book i sec but the able reviewer 
of whatelys logic edinburgh review no cxv says that the 
major premiss is often called the proposition never the principle 



principle 

constituent part whether proximate or ultimate of 
any compound that which helps to make it up or a 
rule to direct us or even a general proposition of 
any kind from which consequences logically flow 
in this latter sense we talk of the principles of a 
science as the principles of morals of political 
economy c meaning the most important the 
fundamental propositions from which the rest may 
be deduced though it is vain to suppose that we 
can accurately limit the sense of words in daily use 
yet in philosophy we may be more precise and 
ought to be so for without precision of language 
there is no science i would therefore exclude 
principle from a philosophical vocabulary in the 
sense either of rule or axiom or general proposition 
of any kind from which particular consequences 
flow 

omitting for the present at least these significa 
tions as improper we shall then find that the term 
principle besides the notion of generality always 
has a reference to origin and hence implies priority 
for though we certainly cannot prove that the 
elements of any compound existed before the com 
pound yet we suppose so and having first the 
elements we can in many cases unite them so as 
afterwards to obtain a new product as when from 
copper and zinc we obtain a new substance brass 
where then principle does not mean cause in the 



 philphicai tocabulabt 

proper sense of the word or the indispensable 
antecedent of some change it at least means that 
which is essential to the being of any thing that 
which is supposed to have preceded uie existence of 
something else and without which the latter could 
never have been it is on account of this supposed 
priority that the term principle is applied to the 
elements of bodies as well as to the causes of 
manifest changes in matter or in mind this notion 
of priority then belongs essentially to principle the 
two notions then essential to principle are generality 
and priority and accordingly it may be defined to 
be that from which many particular things originate 
or at least are supposed to originate that without 
the prior eanstence of which many particular things 
could not he 

in this sense principle comprehends two species 

active principle or cause and constituent 
principle 

now were we to allow the word principle in the 
sense of general proposition leading to particular 
conclusions what analogy could we find between this 
and the other signification just given generality 
no doubt belongs to both and even priority 
in a certain sense inasmuch as a general proposition 
is a premiss from which conclusions follow but it 
is evident that this is a very diflferent sort of priority 
from the real priority of a cause to its effect it is 



frinciplb 

in technical language a subjective not an objective 
priority or in plain words it is a priority in reference 
to our view of it while the other is a real priority 
in the phenomena themselves we must first see 
the general proposition before we can draw the 
inference and in that sense it is prior and in no 
other 

this distinction must be kept in mind in case 
we persist in using the word principle to signify a 
general premiss if that sense be retained though 
generality and even priority in a certain sense may 
still be the characteristics of a principle yet 
we must draw a line between the genera which 
will be two in number namely 

i a general and ultimate cause from which 
many effects follow or else an elementary body 
from which compounds result 

ii a general proposition from which as 
premiss particular conclusions follow 

the first is either a purely metaphysical or a 
physical principle as the case may be the latter is 
a logical principle 

lastly a principle whether metaphysical or 
physical comprehends as we have seen two species 

 active principle or cause 

 constituent principle while a logical 
principle is either speculative or practical otherwise 
called rule according to the division of locke 



 phiixflophicai tocabulart 

those principles or general propositions which ex 
pressly direct our tiioughts emotions and actions are 
called practical while those tiiat do not are specu 
lative in other words speculative principles relate 
to the existence of things as they are practical to 
things as they may be or ought to be as before 
illustrated by the case of speculative and practical 
principles of morals 



a reason 



a reason 

what is called a reason is a cause of a pecu 
liar sort a cause suited to act on the understand 
ing so as to produce conviction or a lower degree 
of belief the question why do i approve of 
such an action may mean either what is the 
cause that actually rouses my sentiment of appro 
bation or else what is the reason or cause 
which on reflection fixes my conviction of the 
worthiness of the actor and hence tends to rouse 
emotion in his favour • it certainly may happen 
that these two causes coincide but they also may 
differ 

why did caesar overthrow the constitution of 
his country through ambition or desire of 
power why was tiberius a tyrant or why do 
you call him a tyrant because he perpetrated 
arbitrary and cruel acts the former is evidently 
a cause usually so called the other a reason or 
a cause of my opinion the one sort of causes 
may be called physical or metaphysical as the 
case may be the other logical being addressed 
solely to the understanding another classifica 
tion would be to divide causes into the physical 
and the mental or metaphysical and then to sub 

l 



 philosophical vocabulary 

divide the latter into pure metaphysical and 
logical causes otherwise called reasons but it 
is more agreeable to the real distinctions of things 
to divide causes into causes proper and reasons 
or logical causes the former being subdivided 
into the physical and the mental or metaphysical 

sometimes however a reason means the final 
cause or purpose why or what is the reason 
that the eye has a lens means this but final 
causes as we have seen are in reality effects 
and they are called causes only because the fore 
sight of such effects is supposed to have created 
a motive in the mind of the deity to provide 
means adapted to the end in view therefore 
final causes if they be entitled to be called causes 
at all are of the nature of reasons they are the 
supposed reasons of the deity for such and such 
creations 

having determined that a reason generally 
means that which acts on the understanding and 
produces belief it is easy to see that this when 
expressed in words must be a proposition for 
propositions alone are addressed to the intellectual 
faculties and as those are supposed to influence 
the understanding therefore they partake of the 
nature of causes but they must be carefully dis 
tinguished from causes physical as well as from 
causes purely metaphysical now a proposition 



a reason 

from which we draw an inference is called in 
logical language a premiss and hence we see 
that a reason expressed in words and a premiss 
are the same 

were we to adopt that distinction before 
pointed out between the objective and the sub 
jective then causes properly so called would be 
objective and reasons subjective for the former 
relate to the being of things in themselves the 
latter to our way of knowing them in short a 
cause physical or one purely metaphysical is the 
indispensable antecedent of any event a cause 
logical or reason is the indispensable antecedent 
of our belief of that event 

though the above be as we conceive the 
proper use of the word reason yet we cannot 
assert that it is the only one for reason is often 
put for cause physical or purely metaphysical 
thus one might ask without any flagrant de 
parture from the common use of words what is 
the reason that sirius twinkles and jupiter not 
meaning what is the physical cause but it is 
vain to attempt to tie down the common use of 
words all we can hope to do is to fix their 
philosophical sense and to shew that a certain 
analogy runs through all the senses though it 
may be farfetched thus in the present instance 
we have shewn that a reason after all is a cause 
of a peculiar sort 



 philosophical vocabulary 



science and philosophy 

science diflfers from other knowledge in this 
that it is the knowledge of general jacts i e facts 
common to many individual existences civil 
history and geography so far as mere topography 
are not sciences because the knowledge they give 
is particular the history of one kingdom not 
being the history of another the geography of 
this country not being the geography of that 
the history of rome is not the same as that of 
greece nor the geography of england as that of 
italy this is the reason why civil history and 
geography are so lengthy a man may read his 
tory all his life and still have very much to learn 
no doubt sciences such as physical geography in 
its general bearings and politics may be founded 
on these but in themselves they are not sciences 

natural history however is science because 
the facts of which it treats are general or com 
mon to innumerable particular existences when 
we describe and class a horse or an elephant we 
describe and class all horses or all elephants 

 hence we see the great imperfection of bacons classification 
in this particular for he considers natural history as no science 
at all as requiring only an effort of memory and he arranges it 
along with civil history as a species of the same genus the 



science and philosophy 

natural history in all its branches is principally 
a science of description and classification and 
therefore it does not come up to the dignity of 
philosophy for all science is not entitled to the 
name of philosophy though all philosophy be 
science 

i what then are the peculiar objects of 
philosophical enquiry 

in order to answer this important and difficult 
question let us consider that everything in nature 
may be regarded in two points of view as exist 
ing with or without reference to what went before 
or what will come after that is with or without 
reference to time in the one case the objects 
of inquiry are considered as coexisting in the 
other as successive there we wish to know them 
as they are at the present moment without 
change here as preceded or followed by other 
phenomena 

agreeably to this well marked distinction and 
according to what was said above that science 
treats of general truths we find that the object of 
all science is twofold viz — 

to discover uniformities of coexistence and 
uniformities of succession in nature 

common use of language seems to have led him into this mistake 
there may be some analogy between civil and natural history 
according to which they have in ordinary language been classed 
together but this analogy is not sufficient for an exact classification 



 philosophical vocabulary 

commencing with uniformities of coexistence 
or in other words the constitution of nature we 
shall find that these uniformities are of two sorts 
the palpable or apparent and the latent or hidden 
the former we may discover by our senses with 
or without artificial assistance including proper 
instruments while the latter can be ascertained 
only by reflection or by a peculiar agency called 
chemical which operates upon the insensible 
particles of matter thus the difiierent tissues 
and the different organs of a horse or a dog can 
be separated by anatomical skill and seen by 
anybody as may the parts of a rose or a tulip 
but the intimate composition of these parts and 
organs can be detected only by a power which 
shall resolve them into their elements now 
though it is the object of science in general to 
trace both these sorts of coexistence yet we 
conceive that to philosophy alone properly so 
called it appertains to determine the intimate 
composition of things but natural history treats 
of palpable coexistence alone and therefore so 
far at least as coexistence is concerned it is a 
branch of science but not of philosophy to 
philosophy then belongs the knowledge of the 
intimate composition of things 

but things are of two grand sorts mental and 
bodily or spiritual and material therefore one 



science and philosophy j 

grand object of philosophy is the discovery by 
analysis of the intimate composition of things 
existing whether bodies or mental phenomena 

the sciences employed upon this object are 
pure mental science or metaphysics and chemis 
try the one having reference to mind the other 
to bodies or material substances thus we find 
out by chemistry that the air we breathe is com 
pounded of three elements oxygen gas nitrogen 
or azote and a very small quantity of carbonic acid 
gas while by metaphysical analysis we discover 
that love and some other passions are made up 
of various elementary feelings 

ii the next grand object of science is to 
determine uniformities of succession or in other 
words the course of nature now in treating of 
cause and effect we remarked that there are some 
uniformities of succession in which the events are 
connected together as cause and effect and others 
in which they are not and we instanced the suc 
cession of day and night night and day as one 
quite uniform but not a case of causation many 
other cases are there where the successive changes 
may depend in some degree one upon another as 
cause and effect though we know not in what 
degree but the probability is that like the suc 

 so far as bodies are concerned this is called by bacon the 
latens schematismus 



 philosophical vocabulary 

cession of day and night they depend chiefly upon 
one or two general causes modified by circum 
stances that is by auxiliary or secondary causes 
such as the palpable changes immediately preced 
ing thus the growth of man from infancy to 
childhood from childhood to youth from youth 
to manhood is a long series of changes uniform 
in all of changes every one of which may be 
indispensable to the next following but still 
contributing to it only in a small degree the 
principal cause of growth being hid far from 
our view in tracing the changes that go on 
during digestion we follow the food from the 
mouth to the stomach where it meets with the 
gastric juice and is changed into chyme from the 
stomach to the smaller bowels where it meets 
with the bile and the pancreatic juice and be 
comes chyle from the bowels to the lacteal 
vessels by which it communicates with the 
blood when digestion is completed the whole 
of these changes constitutes the process of diges 
tion so the discovery of harvey consisted in 
tracing the blood from the left side of the heart 
into the great vessel the aorta from the aorta 
by perpetual subdivision into innumerable small 
arteries from these back again by veins at first 
numberless and minute but at last all uniting 
into one and pouring their contents into the 



science and philosophy 

right side of the heart from this right side 
harvey again traced the blood issuing in one 
great trunk to be subdivided in the lungs into 
ten thousand branches which afterwards reunite 
and discharge the fluid by one vessel into the 
left side of the heart thus is the circulation 
completed in these and similar instances it 
will be observed that there is no attempt to trace 
general causes there is only a history of successive 
phenomena 

let us now take an instance from chemistry 
when we are introduced for the first time into a 
chemists laboratory we are surprised at the various 
changes that ensue on his mixing different sub 
stances together but we feel to have no knowledge 
until he has explained to us the latent process he 
shows us a fluid now clear as water into which he 
pours another fluid equally clear when suddenly 
an inward commotion is perceived bubbles of gas 
rise to the surface and at last there is found at the 
bottom of the glass a solid substance then he 
informs us that the original liquid contained in 
solution a salt compounded of carbonic acid and an 
earth or oxide that the other liquid was a stronger 
acid which combined with the earth or oxide and 
forming an insoluble compound fell to the bottom 
while the carbonic acid being set free ascended 
through the liquid and mixed with the atmosphere 

m 



 philosophical vocabulary 

now we feel to know something for the latent 
process or sequence of phenomena has been laid 
open to us still in all this there is no attempt 
to trace general causes no doubt in knowing 
this sequence we do know something of causa 
tion inasmuch as we know some change indis 
pensable to the next following but this change 
is but the proximate not the ultimate or general 
cause 

now the knowledge of the uniform sequences 
of phenomena is an important part of science 
whether these be sequences of causation or not 
sometimes as in the case of the succession of 
day and night there is no relation of power be 
tween the two successive events at other times 
there may be some relation the preceding change 
being a secondary or a proximate cause of the 
following change but be that as it may the 
knowledge of uniform sequence is interesting 
and important though it be not the highest 
object of science the sciences which treat of 
these sequences are natural history and concrete 
chemistry so far as they treat of sequence at all 
for as we have seen another object of these 
sciences is to trace the constitution of bodies 
apparent and latent natural history then treats 
of the apparent or sensible constitution or struc 
ture of bodies as well as of the sensible pro 



science and philosophy 

cesses or changes which they undergo without 
tracing these to general causes while concrete 
chemistry investigates the hidden or insensible 
constitution of bodies and likewise the latent 
processes which they go through when dififerent 
substances are brought into contact thus 
natural history consists of two parts one of 
which describes the sensible constitution or struc 
ture of bodies and arranges them accordingly 
into classes orders genera and species while 
the other traces the sensible changes which they 
undergo and at most the proximate causes of 
those changes on natural history as its foun 
dation arises the philosophy of natural history 
which attempts to trace general causes 

the philosophy of zoology is commonly called 
physiology of botany physiological botany of 
mineralogy and physical geography of fossil 
zoology and fossil botany geology is the philo 
sophy of descriptive astronomy physical 
astronomy 

the differences in the outward form and 
colour of animals are of much less importance 
than differences in their inward structure 
and they are also more variable in the same 
species but the former are visible to all and 
are therefore remarked while the latter can be 
known only by dissection and patient examina 
tion often with a striking difference in outward 



 fhilosopmcal vocabulary 

appearances we can connect no sensible differ 
ences in the inward structure how different in 
appearance is a pug dog from a newfoundland 
a shetland pony from a race horse much more 
a horse from an ass a sheep from a goat but we 
can trace no difference in anatomy there is 
then a loose distinction in descriptive zoology be 
tween the strict and the popular the former 
treating of the sensible though inward structure 
of animals and of the sensible though inward 
changes which they undergo while the latter 
dwells chiefly upon their outward form and colour 
their movements their habits of life their rela 
tions with other animals c thus the regne 
animal of cuvier contains only a short charac 
teristic description of each animal founded on its 
anatomical structure and sufficient to distinguish 
it from all other species while the great work 
of buffon is an amusing literary production em 
bracing all that he knew about animals their 
modes of life instincts and dispositions such 
also is goldsmiths animated nature works of 
this kind though not very exact may still be 
called works of science inasmuch as they treat of 
general facts— facts common to all species or 
at least to the greater number though they have 
no pretension to the name of philosophy for 
they investigate neither the concealed elements 
nor the hidden causes of things 



science and philosophy 

here it may not be out of place to consider 
from what analogy civil and natural history have 
been classed together as species of the same 
genus not only in common language bdt even in 
the arrangement of bacon 

simple civil history or annals consist of a 
narrative or relation of particular facts either 
successive in the same place or contemporaneous 
in different places with as little reference to 
causes as may be for it is scarcely possible to 
relate events without some suggestion concerning 
their causes— their palpable or proximate causes 
at least the tracing of the hidden or ultimate 
causes of events belongs to the philosophy of 
history 

natural history on the other hand relates 
general facts facts common to whole classes 
orders genera or species at the lowest facts 
either simultaneous as the parts of an animal or 
a plant shown by dissection or else successive as 
the circulation of the blood and the process of 
digestion the knowledge of simultaneous facts 
is one of position only not of causation at all 
and even the knowledge of an uniform sequence 
may give us little insight into causes at least into 
general causes these last are the object of the 
philosophy of natural history of physiology 
geology and physical astronomy such is the 



 phiixphical vocabulary 

analogy between civil and natural history and 
such the diflference both when properly called 
history relate facts simultaneous or successive 
as simply as possible without tracing hidden 
causes but the facts in the one case are par 
ticular in the other general therefore the one 
is science the other not let us take two in 
stances to illustrate the above distinctions the 
one from civil the other from natural history 
no historian no mere annalist can relate the 
events which preceded the great american war 
without mentioning the stamp act and the duty 
on tea as causes of the outbreak these are 
causes which strike every one even the least 
clearsighted they are then palpable or proximate 
but the philosophic historian will stop his narra 
tive for a moment to inquire into the more hidden 
causes of the war the causes which predisposed 
the american mind to so decided a step and this 
he will probably determine to be the yearning of 
a people now no longer in infancy for indepen 
dence and political importance this then was 
the ultimate cause and it is also a general one 
not confined to this particular case but operating 
among different nations at different times 

again in tracing the process of digestion it 
is easy to see that the teeth the saliva the gastric 
juice the mascular motion of the stomach the 



science and philosophy 

bile and the pancreatic juice all produce certain 
changes in the food changes evident to the senses 
and universally attributed to the above as causes 
to a certain extent at least for without them the 
same changes would not ensue but we cannot 
doubt that there are more hidden causes at work 
upon which the vitality of all these agents and 
the peculiar eflfects of each depend the former 
causes are palpable or proximate and a subject 
merely for history the latter hidden or ultimate 
and they belong to the philosophy of the science 
that is to physiology 

here it must be observed however that as 
classes nearly related are apt to run one into 
another so simple or descriptive natural history 
of animals for instance and physiology cannot 
always be clearly distinguished so far as natural 
history treats of structure only of what is sim 
ultaneous and not successive it is quite distinct 
from the philosophy of natural history which 
investigates general causes but when natural 
history relates uniform sequences of phenomena 
it cannot always avoid mentioning causes of some 
sort and here therefore it will sometimes be 
confounded with philosophy uniform sequences 
then are the ground where descriptive natural 
history and philosophy meet the more apparent 
sequences would by all be attributed to the for 



 philosophical vocabulary 

mer such as the outward changes which animals 
undergo from their birth to maturity from ma 
turity to old age their different movements their 
modes of life and their relations to each other 
but the inward and more concealed changes such 
as take place in digestion may be said to belong 
to physiology indeed they generally are so 
considered though when related as known facts 
without any theory without reference to general 
causes they belong more properly to history 

physiology then as generally understood 
comprehends more than what can well be called 
philosophy it is the science of function as 
opposed to structure and treats of the actions or 
uses of all the organs of the body from the most 
apparent to the most concealed from the con 
traction of the muscles to the very obscure 
agency of the brain nerves and ganglia it 
treats of causes of all kinds operating within the 
frame whether they be palpable and proximate 
such as the saliva which softens the food the 
gastric juice which dissolves it the bile which 
changes it still more the synovia which moistens 
the joints c c or whether they be hidden 
and ultimate such as the general causes of the 
heat of the body of nutrition motion and sen 
sation these last form certainly one of the most 
difficult subjects for human inquiry 



science and philosophy 

the highest that is the most important and 
the most difficult object of science is the dis 
covery of hidden ultimate or general causes for 
all these words apply to the same thing and to 
the search after such causes the name of phi 
losophy has always been given these causes 
never present themselves open and naked before 
us they are always surrounded as it were by a 
thick veil which hides them from our eyes to 
pierce this veil to tear asunder this covering is 
then our grand object and our grand difficulty 

the proper name for these causes as we have 
seen is principle or active principle to distinguish 
them from the hidden elements of things con 
sidered merely as component parts to which we 
have given the name of constituent principle the 
knowledge of principles then in both these 
senses is the object of philosophy as distinguished 
from other science we have already illustrated 
the meaning of principle by reference to quinine 
morphia and strychnia which are at one and 
the same time component parts of bark opium 
and nux vomica and the real or hidden causes 
of their medicinal effects we may now also 
mention bitter almonds and bay leaves the 
poisonous influence of which depends upon a 
minute quantity of prussic acid present in those 
substances no science affords us illustrations 

n 



 phiumophical vocabdlabt 

better adapted for our present purpose than that 
of chemistry chemical science is generally 
divided into two parts the first treating of au 
the particular substances in nature their intimate 
composition and the hidden changes which they 
undeio when brought into contact with each 
other in other words the kuentes schematiswiiy 
and the latentes processus the second investi 
gating the effects of certain general principles 
or causes widely diffused throughout nature 
such as caloric and electricity these principles 
are known from their effects but we cannot 
arrest and examine them by themselves and it 
is even disputed whether caloric be a peculiar 
matter or merely a modification of ordinary 
matter 

some of the greatest discoveries consist not 
in the detection of any new principle but in 
generalising and diminishing the number of 
principles or causes already known or rather in 
ferred for often from their effects alone we know 
them when franklin drew down lightning from 
the clouds he did not discover the existence of 
any new principle he proved that the phenomena 
of lightning and those of electricity excited by 
our machines depend upon one and the same 
cause yet this is looked upon as one of the 
greatest discoveries of modern times so should 



science and philosophy 

philosophers succeed in establishing the identity 
of the principle of electricity and that of mag 
netism this also would be a great discovery 

from these examples drawn from the material 
world we may judge what is meant by general 
causes or principles in the world of mind since 
tiie beginning of authentic history we every 
where hear of the poverty of the mass of the 
people the prophecy the poor shall never 
cease out of the land has amply been fulfilled 
poverty has existed more or less not only in 
cold climates but in the warmest and most 
genial not only in barren countries but in the 
most fertile not only under despotic sway but 
under free and constitutional governments not 
only among barbarous nations ignorant of the 
arts of life but among the most polished and 
civilized well acquainted with implements and 
machinery to facilitate the production of wealth 
finally not only among indolent people but even 
among the mrat industrious poverty is known 
among the hardworking population of man 
chester as well as among the wild inhabitants of 
connemara these facts had been present to 
man for a long series of ages and though some 
may have guiessed the real cause of the mischief 
it was reserved for malthus to prove that the 
principle of population that is the tendency of 



 philosophical vocabulary 

population to increase faster than subsistence is 
the grand general cause of the poverty and 
misery of the people surely such a man ought 
to be considered as great a benefactor to man 
kind as the most sublime mathematician and 
astronomer that ever lived 

though this principle is not an ultimate one 
for it can be traced to more general principles 
yet it is not the less valuable on that account 
and it forms a good illustration of the remark of 
bacon that principia media are often more fruit 
ful than principia generalissima 

the ultimate object of philosophy is the dis 
covery of the general laws of nature that is as we 
formerly explained of general effects or tenden 
cies to effects which as such cannot be traced to 
any cause being themselves the most general 
causes that we know of the other and more com 
plicated phenomena of the universe such are 
gravitation cohesion and the three laws of mo 
tion all these are inexplicable at least for the 
present that is we know not their causes but 
they are themselves causes acting universally 
thus at length after all our labour we arrive at 
facts which we cannot explain except upon a 
supposition of a selfexistent first cause it is 
like the world supported on a tortoise the 
tortoise on an elephant the elephant on a whale 



science and philosophy 

but what supports the whale there we are 
stopped short we are as far from a satisfactory 
explanation as ever 

taking this into consideration what shall we 
think of the wisdom of those philosophers those 
famous physical astronomers who think when 
they have found out a general law that there is 
no longer any occasion for a law giver do 
they not perceive that their boasted law is itself 
an effect requiring explanation as much as any 
other and that the only rational questions are 
first whether any cause thereof be traceable by 
us and secondly whether ultimately we must 
rest on a material or a spiritual first cause in 
other words whether matter arranged itself into 
the most beautiful and beneficial order or 
whether this was the work of mind do not 
these philosophers see that the law which they 
have discovered far from weakening the proofs 
of an intelligent first cause decidedly strengthens 
them for a law supposes order and order argues 
design and design a designer so that unless the 
law made itself we must have recourse to deity 

but so natural so unavoidable is the idea of 
a great intelligent first cause that those who 
deny the same in words have been obliged to 
admit his existence though in a covert manner 
for this purpose the term nature has been 



 phiiioeophical tocabulart 

found convenient and instead of saying that 
such and such phenomena are the work of god 
they pronounce them the work of nature thus 
substituting a metaphorical person for a real for 
the word nature properly means the very eflfects 
to be explained which are thus put for the one 
great and unseen cause of all 

in concluding this article i may observe that 
whether the sense i have given to philosophy as 
distinguished from other science be generally 
approved or not yet the statement as to the 
objects of all science will not be thereby affected 
that statement may be correct whatever more 
limited sense we attach to the term philosophy 



hypothesis and theory 



hypothesis and theory 

as no words occur more frequently in phi 
losophy than these it is necessary to fix their 
meaning if possible with accuracy 

hypothesis and theory agree in this that they 
both pretend to explain phenomena in other 
words they assign a cause or the causes thereof 
we cannot therefore be surprised that those 
words should occur so often in philosophy which 
has for its special object to discover the causes 
of things and as causes as we have seen are 
of different sorts so there may be as many 
hypotheses or as many theories corresponding 
relative to the immediate or the remote the 
proximate or the ultimate cause 

secondly hjrpothesis and theory agree also 
in this that both imply more or less of uncer 
tainty as to the accuracy of the explanation for 
when the investigation is thought complete and 
all doubt is at an end theory is changed into 
fact theory is not distinguished from fact by 
the circumstance that the one enounces a cause 
the other not for though a fact may imply no 
cause yet it frequently does imply one thus 
when i say that i can move my arm when i will 



 philosophical vocabulary 

i state what every one would call a fact though 
this fact implies that my will is the cause of the 
motion so when i affirm that heat and moisture 
are causes of vegetation i state what all will 
allow to be facts just as much as when i inform 
any one that the heart of man contains four 
cavities and that the chest is separated from the 
abdomen by a muscle called the diaphram or 
midriff facts relative to structure only not to 
causation hypothesis and theory differ then 
from fact in this that they imply some uncer 
tainty with respect to the causes assigned while 
fact supposes none 

thus far hypothesis and theory agree but 
wherein do they differ 

there is no very definite distinction between 
hypothesis and theory the distinction such as 
it is turns entirely upon the degree of evidence 
possessed by each respectively for an hypothesis 
is only a doubtful theory and on further in 
vestigation and by means of new evidence the 
former may be raised to the dignity of the latter 
thus as we pass from theory to fact involving 
causation so do we pass from hypothesis to 
theory according as the cause in question is 
doubtful probable or certain hypothesis being 
at one end of the series and fact at the other 

from the above it follows that in many cases 



hypothesis and theory 

it may be difficult to say whether the term hypo 
thesis or the term theory be most applicable 
but in other cases there can be no doubt where 
the existence of the supposed cause in the case 
in question rests only upon some faint analogy 
and still more where such a cause is not known 
with certainty to exist in any case there we have 
only an hypothesis thus the vortices of 
descartes were hypothetical because though 
some sort of vortices as whirlpools were known 
to exist yet the analogy between these motions 
and those of the earth and planets was very far 
fetched so the nervous vibrations of hartley 
to which he attributed the phenomena of sensa 
tion were purely hypothetical for what analogy 
is there between a nerve and a musical chord 
in like manner some physiologists have attributed 
all the phenomena of life to mechanical causes 
known to exist others to chemical alone as if 
the human frame were either a mere machine or 
a mere laboratory nay such has been the wild 
ness of hypothesis that the world itself has 
sometimes been supposed to be an animal some 
times even a god 

in other instances a cause not known with 
certainty or even with probability to exist in any 
case is supposed in order to account for some 
phenomena thus newton imagined that the 



 philosophical vocabulary 

phenomena of gravitation might be accounted for 
by the impulse of an unknown substance which 
he called ether and some philosophers in the 
present day attribute the phenomena of light to 
the vibrations of the same mysterious fluid but 
as the existence of ether in any case has never 
been shown by the proper proofs by the only 
proofs by which we can in the first instance ascer 
tain the existence of any body namely by the 
senses as no one has ever seen touched smelt 
heard or tasted ether we have a right to say 
that it exists only hrpothetically the proper 
evidence of the existence of matter in the first 
instance is sense or more correctly perception 
that of the existence of spirit is consciousness 
we believe in the existence of our own spirit 
and of other spirits around us and above us 
which we have not seen for spirits cannot be 
seen or touched and there are other proofs of 
their existence but we are not justified in be 
lieving implicitly in any species of matter which 
no one has ever descried by the senses 

for the same reason the existence of caloric 
and electricity as distinct sorts of matter is hypo 
thetical they are called imponderable but 
what kind of matter can that be which has no 
weight for a long time sensation and muscular 
motion were attributed to animal spirits a fluid 



hypthbsi and theory 

remarkably rare and yolatile which was supposed 
to be always flpng about between the brain and 
the organs of sensation and motion but as no 
one has been able to detect this fluid its existence 
which was always hypothetical is now disbelieved 
altogether in the present day atoms find more 
favour and on them is founded a famous theory 
but as no one has seen or touched such particles 
we may be allowed to doubt their existence and 
call it hypothetical 

in these and similar instances we see a 
marked distinction between hypothesis theory 
and fact for no one could compare the theory 
of gravitation with the hypothesis of ether or 
the fact of muscular motion simply by means of 
nerves with the supposition of animal spirits 
that muscular motion is performed some how or 
other by means of the nerves is an established 
fact involving causation that all bodies tend to 
each other is a theory that the cause of this 
tendency is the impulse of a subtle fluid ether 
is an hypothesis but the only difference be 
tween these three consists in the degree of 
evidence on which our belief is founded 

though hypotheses be in their nature doubt 
ful yet are they far from useless the use of 
hypothesis is not to terminate but to direct 
inquiry for our inquiry must have some object 



 philosophical tocabulabt 

something to prove or disprove and therefore 
a supposition or provisional solution may be 
necessary we assume something to be true 
and then observe make experiments and argue 
to determine whether it be true if our observa 
tion and experiments tally with the assumption 
or if no absurd inferences follow from it our 
hrpothesis may be raised into a theory 

though hypotheses properly so called have 
no place in pure mathematics which treat only 
of things coexistent and not at all of causation 
yet provisional assumptions are made and the 
accuracy of them tested afterwards thus in the 
sixth proposition of euclid it is assumed in the 
first instance that the two sides which subtend 
two equal angles of a triangle are not equal 
and then arguing on this supposition we arrive 
at the absurd conclusion that the less triangle is 
equal to the greater whence we infer for certain 
that our assumption was false and as there can 
here be but two suppositions the other must be 
true in mathematics this mode of proof is 
quite satisfactory because only two suppositions 
can be made but in questions which admit of 
many solutions where the boundaries of truth 
and falsehood are not strictly defined there the 
disproof of one alternative proves not the other 
thus were we to say that cromwell was either 



hypothesis and theory 

an impostor or an enthusiast and having proved 
him not to have been wholly an impostor were 
we to conclude that he must have been wholly an 
enthusiast our conclusion would not be certain 
for he might have been partly the one partly the 
other we ought therefore in subjects which 
admit only of probability always to distrust those 
arguments which are stated with mathematical 
precision as in this form either such a thing is 
or is not for generally there is a third alter 
native which thus is kept out of sight 

some may be unwilling to allow that the only 
difference between hypothesis theory and fact 
involving causation consists in the degree of 
evidence on which they rest respectively but 
if there be any other difference i should like 
to know what it is theory it may be said is 
used to explain facts to account for them but 
what is meant by these phrases to explain a 
phenomenon or fact or to account for it properly 
signifies as we have seen to point out the cause 
thereof and the cause when proved must be 
another fact or until fully proved a theory cer 
tainly our speculative knowledge is thus enlarged 
and possibly the cause may be one which we can 
apply to practice but we are not to suppose 
that the fact explained is one whit less mysterious 
than before it may be less anomalous more

akin to facts formerly known but it is not the 
less incomprehensible 

suppose it proyed that gravitation is owing 
to impulses of ether what do we learn bjr the 
discovery we learn that gravitation is the 
effect of impact that therefore it is a fact similar 
to others with which we are well acquainted 
instead of being dififerent from them thus we 
simplify our knowledge we reduce two modes of 
motion to one but impulse though more fami 
liar is quite as incomprehensible as attraction 
it seems to us no doubt less mysterious because 
it is more familiar but this is a mere delusion 
and the effect of custom why does one billiard 
ball when put in motion drive another before 
it could we have predicted such a result bad 
we never seen it can we give any reason why 
it should be so or if we could give a reason 
what would it amount to it would amount to 
this either that some change intervenes between 
the impact of the one ball and the motion of the 
other a change before unknown a new fact or 
link in the chain of causation or that the real 
or ultimate cause of the motion is not impact but 
something involved in the act of impact some 
thing hidden from our sight as morphia is hidden 
in the substance of opium but whatever the 
explanation the why of impulse may be it can be 



hypothesis and theory 

only the statement of some other fact as a cause 
and not at all a reason such as the reasoning of 
mathematics consists of whereby we see by the 
minds eye without actual experiment that the 
angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are 
and must be equal all facts then involving 
causation are incomprehensible in this sense that 
we can never see any reason properly so called 
why any cause should produce any eflfect or why 
it might not have produced one altogether dif

metaphysics logic grammar 

their respective provinces 

it is not a little remarkable that although so 
much has been said and written on the subject of 
logic from the days of aristotle downwards yet 
few branches of knowledge are so ill defined 
by some logic is understood to embrace a very 
extensive territory while by others it has been 
restricted to very narrow limits thus accord 
ing to watts logic is the art of using reason 
well in our enquiries after truth and the com 
munication of it to others and in a note to 
this we are told the word reason in this place 
is not confined to the mere faculty of reasoning 
or inferring one thing from another but includes 
all the intellectual powers of man 

against this definition as too extensive and 
too vague archbishop whately rebels and says 
that logic in the most extensive sense which 
the name can with propriety be made to bear 
may be considered as the science and also as the 
art of reasoning according to this definition 
which the author considers sufficiently extensive 
several important subjects usually considered as 
belonging to logic are excluded from it for

instance all appertaining to conceptions and 
names to judgments and propositions to defini 
tion and classification though it appears from 
the work itself of which the ahove is the opening 
sentence that the author considered these sub 
jects as comprised within the province of logic 
the definition however does not say so and 
accordingly this may be taken as a specimen not 
of an enlarged but on the contrary of a very 
narrow definition as that of watts is of a very 
extensive one between these two extremes a 
proper definition of logic will probably be 
found moreover archbishop whately seems to 
contradict what he had before laid down when 
he says that logic is entirely conversant about 
language thereby lowering logic to the level of 
grammar and breaking down the distinction 
between them whereas in the introduction he 
had said that the most appropriate office of 
logic is that of instituting an analysis of the 
process of the mind in reasoning 

the third book of whatelys logic treats of 
fallacies and a considerable part of it is taken 
up with what the author calls nonlogical fal 
lacies why then it may be asked are they 
treated of in a work professedly on logic the 

° see whately s logic book ii sec note 
p 



 phiusophical vocabulary 

truth is that the author is obliged to include 
more under logic than he is willing to allow 

but if whatelys definition of logic be narrow 
that given by barthlemy saint hilaire the 
translator of aristotles organon is still more so 
according to saint hilaire logic is a science 
not an art and the object of that science is 
demonstration to justify this definition the 
words of aristotle at the commencement of the 
prior analytics are quoted first we shall 
mention the subject and the end of this study 
the subject is demonstration the end is science 
demonstrated 

having first shown that logic is a science 
saint hilaire then inquires what is the object of 
that science to this question aristotle replies 
it is demonstration nothing says saint 
hilaire more simple nor more true than 
this answer 

if this be so the limits of logic are indeed 
narrow for demonstration is to be found only 
in mathematics the science of quantity therefore 
logic treats only of mathematical reasoning 
but this is not true of any system of logic with 
which we are acquainted no writer on logic 
confines himself to mathematical reasoning con 
sequently demonstration is not the sole object of 
logic as universally understood reasoning in

metaphysics logic grammar 

general not cumonstratiye reasoning only is 
always included under logic but we must not 
suppose that the above is really given by aris 
totle as a complete definition of logic it is the 
opening sentence of the book entitled prior 
analytics and professes to state nothing more 
than the subject and end of that and the following 
book the posterior analytics which treat indeed 
of logic but not of all logic we cannot 
therefore blame aristotle for having given too 
narrow a definition of the whole science nay 
further on prior analytics chap iv aristotle 
says expressly that the work on which he is 
engaged will comprehend more than demonstra 
tion that it will contain the whole doctrine of 
the syllogism which says he is more general 
than demonstration which is only a sort of 
syllogism whereas every syllogism is not a 
demonstration hereupon he enters upon the 
syllogism purporting to beat of demonstration 
afterwards as he actually has done in the 
posterior analytics 

of late other definitions have been given of 
logic and by high authority the very highest 
of all on this subject has defined logic to be 
the science of the formal laws of thought 
with all due deference to that authority i cannot 
but remark that this definition were it even cor 



 phitxsophical vocabulary 

rect could not answer the purpose of a definition 
to others to the unlearned at least because the 
definition is more obscure than the thing defined 
it contains a word one of the most ambiguous in 
all philosophy the word formal and though 
most men have some idea of logic the great 
majority know nothing at all about form except 
in the popular sense so that to them the above 
definition would only be a bewilderment and a 
puzzle rendering their previous conception not 
more clear but more confused another able 
author adopting this definition explains formal 
to mean necessary or essential so that according 
to him logic is the science of the necessary 
laws of thoughts and so he has entitled his 
book how then it may be asked is logic dis 
tinguished from metaphysics surely meta 
physics treat of the necessary laws of thought 
as well as of the laws of sensation and of emotion 
logic then is not a science distinct from meta 
physics but only one part of it such a con 
clusion we can by no means admit and therefore 
the above definition must fall to the ground 
but if by the term formal reference be made to 
words and words be styled the forms of thoughts 

 for some account of the various senses in which the term 
form has heen used see thomsons outlines of the necessary 
laws of thought introduction section

metaphysics logic grammar 

then whether the above definition be full and 
adequate or not it is at all events correct as far 
as it goes for it points out one distinctive 
feature of logic namely the alliance of thought 
with words for logic treats not of language 
merely for then it would be grammar nor of 
thoughts only for then it would be a branch of 
metaphysics but it treats of thoughts combined 
with words or expressed in words thus while 
letters words and sentences belong to grammar 
conceptions judgments and reasonings to meta 
physics names propositions and arguments are 
the subject of logic 

names suggest or are meant to suggest things 
whether material as trees and stones or imma 
terial as sensations and conceptions proposi 
tions express the relation of things while argu 
ments are propositions as inferred from other 
propositions 

according to this sense of the word formal 
the definition of sir william hamilton would 
mean that logic is the science of the laws of 
thought in alliance with language in this sense 
i consider it correct as far as it goes whether 
it be full and adequate is another question as 
also whether it be not too obscure for ordinary 
comprehension 

when logic is styled the science of the 



 philosophical vocabulary 

neoessary laws of thought there is a sense that 
might be given to the words which would ex 
actly explain the object of one branch of the 
science logic proper or pure did these words 
imply that the peculiar object of logic was to 
teach us as much of the laws of thought as is 
necessary to maintain consistency in thinking 
then the statement would be quite accurate 
consistency in thinking as we shall see presently 
is the especial object of simple logic not truth 
or agreement with the nature of things which 
appertains to mixed or applied logic all the 
laws of thought belong not to logic but those 
only which maintain consistency in thinking 
thus logic knows nothing of association so im 
portant among the laws of thought 

logic seems to hold a middle place between 
metaphysics and grammar metaphysics treat 
of the human mind and all its phenomena which 
are comprised in three words sensations thoughts 
and emotions lcc treats only of thoughts 
combined with words or expressed in words 
while grammar treats of words all words of 
which there are several sorts — nouns adjectives 
verbs adverbs conjunctions c thus logic 
agrees with metaphysics inasmuch as it treats of 
thoughts but it differs in omitting sensations 
and emotions and in treating of thoughts only 



metaphysics logic grammab i 

in connection with words while it agrees with 
grammar in considering thoughts combined with 
words but whereas in logic thought is the 
subject and words are regarded only as subsidiary 
to thought in grammar words are the subject 
and thought is considered only as subsidiary to 
words that is as necessary to determine that a 
word is truly a word meaning something and 
not a mere sound or a mere number of letters 
thrown together and also to fix of what sort any 
word may be as noun verb or adverb 

the definition of logic as the science of the 
laws of thought in alliance with language agrees 
with these views but though accurate as far as 
it goes in one respect at least it appears deficient 
inasmuch as no allusion is made to logic as a 
mixed science combining speculation with prac 
tical application on the contrary by that defi 
nition it would appear to be a science of pure 
speculation like metaphysics but assuredly 
such is not logic as generally understood 
whatever difference of views may be entertained 
as to the exact province of logic on one point 
at least almost all are agreed namely that logic 
has a direct practical end in view the improve 
ment of our intellectual faculties either in whole 
or in part now though men may give any 
meaning to words they please provided they 



 philosophical vocabulary 

explain their meaning yet there is seldom any 
advantage in taking a well known word in a sense 
very diflferent from the usual at least it ought 
to be done with great reserve in the present 
instance we see no sjafficient reason for departing 
from the established meaning of the word logic 
and consequently we can by no means accept of 
the above definition as a full and adequate one 
omitting as it does an essential element of the 
subject at most if logic be divided into two 
parts pure and mixed that definition may suffice 
for the former but it cannot embrace the whole 
we have therefore still to seek a full and ade 
quate conception and definition of logic and 
for this purpose we must take a general survey of 
the mental sciences 

those sciences the subject of which is the 
human mind may all be classed under one or 

 mr de morgan has written a treatise on formal logic 
thereby implying that there is a logic not formal and mr 
thomson who considers logic as the science of the necessary 
laws of thought still divides it into pure and applied logic 
sahit hilaire in the preface to his translation of aristotles 
organon says at one time that logic treats only of the form of 
thought but he afterwards allows that there is such a thing as 
applied logic which treats of something else than form there 
fore by his own showing logic in its generic meaning is not a 
mere science of form pure logic may be but not atl logic 
otherwise there is a contradiction 



metaphysics logic grammar 

other of the following heads — i pure mental 
science ii mixed or applied mental science 
to the former the term metaphysics properly 
belongs to the latter no common term is attached 
but should we extend the meaning of the word 
metaphysics so as to comprise all mental science 
then the one class would be pure and the other 
mixed or applied metaphysics at present how 
ever for fear of ambiguity we shall use meta 
physics in its more usual and restricted sense of 
pure mental science this treats of the human 
mind as it is without any reference to direction 
and improvement it is therefore purely specu 
lative and comprises — i the analysis and 
classification of the mental phenomena ii the 
theory of the origin and succession of the 
mental phenomena 

the second class of the mental sciences is of 
a mixed nature combining speculation with 
practical application these sciences rest not 
in the knowledge of the human mind as it 
is but they have a further object namely 
to direct it to direct thoughts emotions and 
through them outward actions this great class 
naturally divides itself into two agreeably to 

 as a specimen of pure mental philosophy i may be 
allowed to refer to my own analysis and theory of the 
emotions 

q 



 phiixhcai vocabulabt 

those two grand departments of the mind thb 
understanding and the emotions to the 
latter which has for its object to direct the emo 
tions in the pursuit of happiness the term moral 
philosophy may be applied taken in the most 
extensive sense in which it can properly be used 
in this sense it includes not only morals strictly 
so called or ethics but politics in all its branches 
as well as the science of taste of all which the 
emotions of the human mind are the subject 

but what name belongs to the former branch 
of the mixed mental sciences viz that which 
professes to direct the understanding has it a 
name or must we invent one i confess that i 
see no occasion for a new term when an old one 
readily presents itself and here the word logic 
naturally occurs this sense of the word may 
be very extensive very vague if you will but 
some word is required for this class of sciences 
and whatever may be hit upon the same objection 
may be made which after all is no valid objec 
tion for an extensive class must have a coexten 
sive name the only serious questions are two 
are there sufficient grounds for the formation of 
a class of sciences opposed to moral philosophy 
and having for its object to direct the under 
standing as the other has to direct or regulate 
the emotions and if so by what name shall we 



metaphtsica logic grammab 

call it supposing that we adopt our known 
friend logic shall we he employing the term in 
an unwarrantahle or very unusual sense i think 
not at least the great father of modern phi 
losophy the immortal bacon has employed it in 
a sense no less extensive for in his glorious work 
the de augmeniisj he divides all the sciences 
which treat of the uses and objects of the mental 
faculties into the two great classes of logic and 
ethics the former of these he subdivides into 
the arts of discovering judging retaining and 
communicating truth here then we have the 
word logic used in a sense as extensive as that 
which i propose supported by so great an 
authority i shall not scruple to define logic 
taken in its most comprehensive sense as the 
science which directs the understanding in the pur 
suit of truth 

thoughts then are the subject of logic 
truth the object 

ii it must be allowed that logic as thus 
defined comprehends a great deal and therefore 
it will probably admit of several subdivisions in 
tracing these subdivisions we shall best discover 
what it comprises 

we must observe in the first instance that 
there is a branch of philosophy which seems to 
occupy a middle place between metaphysics and 



 phirxphical vocabulary 

logic comprising as it does the first principles 
of human knowledge principles some of them 
strictly selfevident others not strictly selfevident 
nor yet capable of proof which nevertheless 
must be taken for granted before we can advance 
one step of the first kind are the axioms 
of mathematics such as things which are equal 
to the same thing are equal to one another two 
straight lines cannot enclose a space all right 
angles are equal to one another c of the 
second kind are the following articles of belief 
 • belief in our own personal identity 

 belief in the faithfulness of memory or 
in other words trust in memory 

 belief in the existence of the external 
world 

 belief in the uniformity of nature 
now there is a branch of philosophy which 

has for its object to determine what are and what 
are not first principles and on what ground they 
must be received this as i have observed 
seems to hold a middle place between metaphy 
sics and logic but it belongs rather to the 
latter if treated speculatively as a matter of 
mere curiosity it may be a branch of metaphysics 
but in such a case pure speculation without re 
ference to application is hardly possible and as 
the solidity of all our subsequent knowledge must 



metaphysics logic grammar 

depend upon the goodness of the foundation and 
nothing can be raised without a foundation there 
fore the science which treats oi first principles 
must be closely connected with that which treats 
of secondary principles and the advancement of 
knowledge for these reasons we shall divide 
ijogic in the first instance into primary and 
secondary logic the former being entirely de 
voted to the settlement of first or fundamental 
principles of belief this may be otherwise 
called philosophia prima 

iii we come now to the subdivisions of se 
condary logic this to which by many the term 
logic would be confined may be divided into two 
parts the one of which we shall call pure the other 
applied logic but though in reference to the 
latter the former may well be called pure yet it 
is not strictly a pure or unmixed science like 
metaphysics for metaphysics treat only of the 
phenomena of the human mind whereas pure 
logic treats of the phenomena of thought in 
connection with words moreover as we shall 
see presently even pure logic has a direct prac 
tical object which metaphysics have not it is 
called by some formal logic words being con 
sidered as the forms of thought 

pure or formal logic is usually divided into 
three parts which treat respectively not of pure 



 philosophical vocabulart 

conceptions judgments and reasonings as meta 
physics would treat but of these united to words 
that is of names propositions and arguments 
the former tlen are metaphysical the latter 
logical terms pure logic considers not how 
far names and the conceptions they raise corres 
pond with the reality of things nor yet whether 
propositions be true or false nor even whether 
the conclusion of any argument be sound but it 
determines what a name in general is and what 
different sorts of names there may be as singular 
or proper and common or general generic and 
specific abstract and concrete it analyzes a pro 
position and shows of what parts all propositions 
are composed and it also enumerates various 
kinds of propositions such as categorical and 
hypothetical affirmative and negative universal 
and particular and lastly it analyzes the process 
of reasoning points out different species thereof 
and shows in what cases the conclusion does and 
in what cases it does not follow from the 
premises either demonstratively or prolbly 
thus the name centaur answers to nothing in 
nature but we have a conception thereof the 
proposition agamemmm slew hector y is false but 
still as a proposition correct the reasoning the 
mind of man is material therefore like other matter 
it mil enter after death into other combinations emd 



metaphysics logic oaambcab 

perish as mind is correct for the conclusion is 
fairly drawn though it he false because the 
premises are false the words true and false as 
applied to propositions and conclusions do not 
belong to pure logic and instead thereof we 
have correct and incorrect consistent inconsistent 
and contradictory neither do the words real and 
imaginary as applied to conceptions appertain to 
logic instead of them we have clear and conused 

according to the above view of the province 
of pure logic it may be defined as the science 
which contains the rules of consistent thinking as 
inerred from the verbal expression of thought 
grammar on the other hand contains the rules 
of correct eospression as inferred from the common 
use of language 

pure logic and grammar have both then a 
direct practical object as implied by the word 
rule the object of the one being consistent 
thought of the other correct expression now the 
rules of grammar though derived from the daily 
use of words and liable to considerable varieties 
in different languages have yet something com 
mon to all languages and therefore we may be 
sure derived from the fundamental laws of 
thought consequently there must be an inti 
mate alliance between consistent thought and 
correct expression between logic and grammar 



 philosophical vocabulary 

both logic and grammar as containing rules 
partake of the nature of an art as well as a 
science pure metaphysics on the contrary 
contains no rules laws only for it pretends not 
to direct but simply to state what the mental 
phenomena are to analyze and classify them and 
to trace the general order of their succession 

iv applied logic is opposed to pure and 
forms the other part of secondary logic this is a 
much more comprehensive as well as a less exact 
science than the former for it applies the know 
ledge of the human mind and its processes 
derived from metaphysics and pure logic to the 
acquisition of objective truth that is the truth in 
all objects which the mind contemplates pure 
logic contents itself with ascertaining that con 
ceptions are clear propositions correct and not 
inconsistent with each other and conclusions ac 
curately drawn from premises but applied logic 
wishes to determine whether conceptions be agree 
able to the reality of things whether propositions 
and conclusions be true thus the whole field of 
science is open to applied logic and consequently 
its scope is very extensive 

though the sphere of applied logic be so 
comprehensive yet it does not seem to admit of 
any exact logical division but we can enume 



metaphysics logic grammar 

rate the principal subjects that fall within its 
province which are as follows — 

 a statement of the real object or objects 
of philosophy and science and wherein these 
diflfer from other knowledge under this head 
the words cause and law of nature must be ex 
plained 

 a general account of the means whereby 
the sciences may be advanced viz experience 
including observation and experiments and 
reasoning here the different sorts of reasoning 
must be mentioned demonstrative and probable 
inductive and deductive and some general prin 
ciples laid down whereby it may be known what 
sort of reasoning is most applicable to any 
branch of science and what degree of certitude 
it admits of here also an account should be 
given of the different methods used in scientific 
inquiry such as the analytic and the synthetic 
but the principal object of this department 
should be to trace the laws of induction those 
of deduction belonging more particularly to pure 
logic

taken as specimens of the art of attaining truth 
in general while the second book of the orga 
num contains special rules for induction and 
the de atigmentis scientiarum comprises a gene 
ral classification of the objects of knowledge 
the third book of locke on the other hand 
which treats of words is for the most part a 
discourse on pure logic and perhaps the most 
valuable that ever was written on names the 
first division of the science indeed the great 
work of locke comprises pure metaphysics as 
well as logic in both its branches the first and 
second books which treat of the mental phe 
nomena or ideas as locke calls them their 
origin nature and succession are purely meta 
physical great part of the third book of words 
is pure logic and the fourth of knowledge 
and opinion is applied logic 



metaphysics logic grammar 

mr thomson in his outline of the necessary 
laws of thought has divided logic into pure 
and applied and has well pointed out the dif 
ference between them the distinction is im 
portant formerly as mr thomson observes 
applied logic was treated of under the name of 
method as a fourth branch of logic in general 
and classed along with the three branches of pure 
logic 

the distinction here insisted on has been dis 
regarded even by the best writers thus arch 
bishop whately considers all logic as pure or 
formal and makes no account of applied logic 
so does sir w hamilton who defines logic to 
be the science of the formal laws of thought 
even mr mill in his great work alludes not to 
this distinction his division of the subject into 
ratiocinative and inductive logic might seem 
indeed to point to it were it not that under the 
former he treats of some things which do not 
belong to pure logic watts makes a jumble of 
pure and applied logic for after treating of 
propositions logically he has a chapter on pre 
judices now pure logic treats indeed of 
sophisms but knows nothing of the predisponent 
causes of error idola or prejudices even bacon 
in his de augmentisy makes no distinction between 
pure and applied logic 



 phitiosophical vocabulary 

though the distinction between pure and 
mixed logic be well founded on principle yet we 
must not suppose that it is always easy to keep 
them separate in a logical treatise the subject 
of fallacies in particular shows how the one runs 
into the other though these have been distin 
guished into two sorts fallacies in dictione and 
fallacies eatra dictionem according as the sophism 
is supposed to lie in the expression or in the matter 
yet there occur some which may be classed 
either with the one or with the other or more 
properly with neither these are when the mid 
dle term is ambiguous in sense and they are 
called by whately semilogical fallacies 

v closely connected with applied logic are 
the arts of retaining and communicating truth 
these indeed have been classed by bacon under 
the general name of logic and treated of accord 
ingly but as this may be considered as too 
wide and vague a sense of the word we prefer to 
consider these arts not as integral parts but as 
appendages of logic 

concerning the art of retaining truth little 
need here be said i shall observe only that it 
mainly depends upon three things — attention 
repetition and association 

 see the de augmentis scientiarum lib v cap and 
lib vi cap l 



metaphtsicsy logic orammab 

in these three words nearly the whole art is 
comprised 

the art of communicating truth may be sub 
divided into three branches — 

 the general art of teaching — gram 
mar — rhetoric 

it is proper in a logical point of view as well 
as highly useful that the art of teaching should 
be considered as a separate special branch of 
knowledge requiring a particular education and 
not an art which any one may exercise who has 
acquirements whether he have learnt how to 
communicate them or not this is a principle 
which now seems recognised by the general 
adoption of training schools we train school 
masters for our village schools but we have not 
yet begun to train them for schools of a higher 
order if a man have taken a high degree at 
oxford or cambridge if he be a good scholar it 
is thought that he must needs be a good school 
master a great mistake the general art of 
teaching must give an account of the various 
modes as well as methods of teaching thir 
advantages and disadvantages such as 

 discourses written or unwritten read or 
heard 

 questionings viva voce or written compos 
ing in prose or verse learning by heart 



 philoeophical vocabuiiaby 

 ocular representations such as pictures 
maps c 

 experiments in mechanical philosophy and 
chemistry 

 dissections and demonstrations as in 
anatomy 

 simple exhibitions of specimens as in 
natural history 

such are the modes of teaching as for the 
methods they are either public or private solitary 
or simultaneous magisterial or mutual selfdepen 
dent for the most part or dependent on assistance 
from others between which last the difference is 
highly important 

we may also distinguish different systems of 
teaching that for instance which tends to unity 
simplicity and concentration and that which 
tends to multiplicity and diffusion the former 
being the system of our ancestors the latter that 
of the present day the one calculated to make 
deeply learned and thoughtful students the 
other to rear up imposing talkers and showy 
men of the world 

the second branch of the art of communi 
cating tuth is grammar or the art of using 
language correctly language being the grand 
organ of communication of the connection 
between pure logic and grammar as well as of 



metaphysics logic grammar 

the difference between them we have already 
spoken 

the third branch of the art of communicating 
is rhetoric or the art of using language 
effectively as grammar is the art of using it 
correctly here we come to the very verge of 
our proper subject if not beyond it for the 
object of logic and its attendant arts is simply 
truth while that of rhetoric is to render truth 
effective that is acceptable or agreeable to those 
whom we address thus rhetoric speaks not 
only to the understanding but also to the emo 
tions and therefore it really holds a middle place 
between logic and moral philosophy 

to sum up all in a few words the object of 
pure logic is consistency in thought of applied 
logic truthy or agreement of thought with the 
nature of things of grammar correctness in 
language of rhetoric effect

the categories 



having completed our philosophical vo 
cahulary we are now better prepared for the 
consideration of the catbgoribs the term 
categories or rather the categories has been 
applied especially to the famous classification of 
aristotle under which he professed to include 
every object of human thought every thing 
capable of being named in other words the 
categories were the summa genera or highest 
classes under which all things might be compre 
bended all things of which we could think or to 
which we could give a name the categories of 
aristotle were the following — 

 ovria substancb 

 ndaov quantity 

 iiolov quality 

 ti relation 

 riov where or place 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

 itote when or time 

 keiadal situation 

 extv having holding or possessing 

 uotelv action 
 jtacrietv passion 

such is the celebrated classification of aris 
totle which for the time when it appeared may 
be considered as not unworthy of that great 
philosopher though to us at the present day it 
appears very far from perfect erring as it does 
by omission as well as by redundancy 

first as to omission among these categories 
we look in vain for some things which have 
received names in all languages under the sun 
things which are present to us during all our 
waking hours and often even when asleep which 
alone are intimately and immediately known to 
us and by means of which alone we become 
acquainted with all other things such are the 
various sensations thoughts and emotions which 
together make up our consciousness of these 
which we may call in general mental phenomena 
we find no mention in the above classification 
quality and relation may no doubt apply to 
mind as well as to body but sensations emo 
tions and conceptions are overlooked this is 
the one great omission the other faults are 
faults of redundancy 



the categories 

allowing that the first six genera are well dis 
tinguished what can we think of classing action 
and passion as genera distinct from relation 
both action and passion mean the relation of 
power or of cause and effect only with this 
difference that action refers particularly to the 
cause or antecedent passion to the effect or conse 
quent both being names of relation consequently 
the ninth and tenth categories must be expunged 
as redundant being included under the fourth 

the fifth and sixth categories or place and 
time are quite distinct but how does situation 
differ from where or place situation position 
and place all mean the same thing all relate to 
space and to something existing in space con 
sidered in reference to something else so existing 
these somethings being not named must be 
supposed included under one of the other cate 
gories as space is included under place or where 
consequently the seventh category may be ex 
punged as redundant 

and surely the eighth having holding or 
possessing can have no pretence to a summum 
genus expressing as it does not a simple thing 
but something very complex the elements of 
which must be comprehended under the other 
categories therefore the eighth category may 
also be expunged 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

aristotles chapter on the eighth category on 
possession is rather curious it resembles more 
an article in a dictionary giving the various 
senses of the greek word exiv than a chapter 
in a scientific work thus we are told that excpi 
to have is variously used — first as a mode of 
being a disposition or habit as when we say 
that a man has science or virtue as quantity 
for instance the height we have as having 
what surrounds the body a garment a cloak 
 having in or on a part of the body as having 
a ring on ones finger or in relation to a part 
of the body as having a hand or a foot con 
taining any thing as a cask has wine possess 
ing as having land or houses having as a 
wife or a husband there may be some faint 
analogy between all these significations but none 
sufficient to establish a definite meaning of the 
word fit for scientific purposes indeed this 
chapter is quite unworthy of aristotle 

from the above examination it appears that 
of the ten categories of aristotle four must be 
expunged as redundant while one must be 
added to render the list complete the amended 
classification will then be the following — 

 mental phenomena 

 categories chap xv 



 



the cateqorifis 

 substancb divided into two species 
mind or spirit and body or matter 

 quantity 

 quality also divided into two species 
mental quality and bodily quality 

 relation 

 place or more simply space place in 
volving a relation 

 time 

this new classification must be allowed to be 
an improvement upon the old but we may far 
ther inquire whether it may not be rendered still 
better it is clear that if space and time be 
allowed to stand distinct from quantity then we 
must add to these number for otherwise it will 
not be included under any category therefore 
to the above seven categories we shall add 

 number 

two questions however still remain to be dis 
cussed first whether time space and number 
should be classed distinct from quantity and 
secondly whether relation should be separated 
from quality 

we have seen in the first part the philoso 
phical vocabular that quantity belongs not 
only to material substance but to time space 
and number considered without any reference 
to substance with all these quantity is in 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

separably connected that is wherever material 
substance time space or number exists there 
is quantity still quantity does not necessarily 
suppose substance for there may be quantity of 
time or of pure space nor does quantity 
necessarily suppose time for there may be 
quantity of space nor does quantity necessarily 
suppose space for there may be quantity of time 
or of number nor finally does quantity neces 
sarily suppose number for there may be quantity 
of time or of space therefore quantity is 
something which is neither substance nor time 
nor space nor number and therefore it is pro 
perly classed apart 

with respect to the second question whether 
relation should be classed apart from quality it 
may at first appear that such separation is incor 
rect because we have seen in the former part 
the philosophical vocabulary that at bottom 
every quality does suppose relation of some 
kind or other but at the same time we re 
marked that there was a real difference between 
qualities commonly called simple and relative 
qualities inasmuch as the relation in the former 
case though it may be discovered by meta 
physical analysis is commonly not attended to 
our thoughts being centered sometimes on the 
cause sometimes on the effect not on the re 



 the categories 

lation between them this is one reason why 
relation should be classed apart from duality 
but there is another more satisfactory 

though strictly speaking there is no quality 
without some relation yet in the case of quantity 
there is relation without quality the relations 
of quantity in space time and number are the 
subject of pure mathematics the relations of 
quantity in body of mixed mathematics and 
these are quite distinct from quality therefore 
quality and relation ought not to be classed 
together 

some there are who class quality relation 
and quantity all togetherunder the common name 
attribute but this classification must be purely 
verbal unless it can be shown wherein these three 
agree and for my own part i can see no agree 
ment nor do i find that logicians have been able 
to define attribute so taken mr mill allows 
that logicians have not given any satisfactory 
account of attribute when taken to comprehend 



b 



the difficulty of distinguishing between quality and relation 
was well seen by aristotle for after some discussion on the 
subject he ends by saying after all if the same thing may be 
at the same time a relation and a quality there is nothing absurd 
in classing it under both genera — categories chap viii — 
in this case there certainly would be a logical imperfection for 
no one genus should overlay another 

t 



 intboduction to mental pmlosopht 

quality relation and quantity system of logic 
book i chap iii s another author and one 
of very high authority classes quantity quality 
and relation under the common head ens per 
accidensy in opposition to ens per se or substance 
but i do not see that ens per accidens admits of 
any better definition than attribute 

attribute is generally supposed to belong to 
substance and to be inseparable from it as when 
we talk of a substance and its attributes but 
then quantity is not an attribute for space 
time and number have quantity though they 
are not substances so space time and number 
have relations quite independent of substance 
which relations cannot therefore be attributes 
therefore in the vocabulary i have restricted 
attribute to the sense of quality alone and more 
particularly to one species of quality 

moreover the word attribute is liable to am 
biguity for it has two senses a metaphysical and 
a logical when we divide things into sub 
stances and attributes it is clear that we speak 
metaphysically and the division is incomplete 
for time space and number are not substances 
nor attributes of substances but when we talk 

 see notes to reids brief account of aristotles logic p 
of reids works edited by sir william hamilton 

 see article quality 



 



the categories 

of subject and attribute then we speak logically 
and attribute becomes synonymous with predi 
cate whereas in the former sense it corresponded 
to quality or property to avoid this ambiguity 
the word accident or ens per acddens has been 
substituted for attribute in the metaphysical 
sense 

upon the whole until a better division be 
pointed out i must be satisfied with the eight 
categories given above for i cannot see that they 
err either by omission or by redundancy it 
appears to me that all the objects of thought all 
that may become the subject of science can be 
classed under one or other of these categories 
but in order fully to ascertain this point let us 
consider first our various mental phenomena 
and their objects and secondly the various 
sciences 

since the above professes to be a complete 
enumeration of the elementary objects of thought 
there should be a thought or in the language of 
locke a simple idea corresponding to each of 
these objects and to none besides while all other 
or complex ideas should be made up of these 
simple ones this ia only to say that thoughts 
and the objects of thoughts must correspond 
let us then see whether the former do tally with 
the enumeration above given of the latter 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

all the phenomena of mind may be divided 
into two great classes the one of which may be 
called the class of outward the other that of 
inward phenomena not that the former are less 
mental than the latter but that it is by those 
alone we become acquainted with the world 
without outward phenomena may be divided 
into two genera sensations and perceptions 
inward phenomena are divided into two orders 
intellectual phenomena or thoughts and emo 
tions which are distinguished from each other by 
the absence or presence of feeling in the strict 
sense of the word that is of pleasure or pain 
happiness or misery thoughts again are sub 
divided into conceptions and relations according 
as they do not or do necessarily suppose two 
things compared together conceptions are either 
simple or compound the latter comprehending 
conceptions of substances and their qualities 
and conceptions of modes or modifications of 
things independent of substance while relations 
are either of coexistence of succession or of re 
semblance such in short is a classification of the 
mental phenomena made without any reference 
to the above classification of things or categories 
the same in fact which appeared some years ago in 
my principles of human happiness and diflfering 
little from that of the late dr brown let us 



the categobie 

then see whether the two classifications agree 
to begin with the phenomena of mind gene 
rally these find a place the first place in the 
categories it is clear that the phenomena of 
mind may themselves be objects of thought 

sensations in the strict sense of the word 
have no objects we are conscious of them and 
that is all for they do not suggest their causes 
directly but indirectly through our perceptions 
now the objects of our perceptions are the 
qualities of matter and these find a place among 
the categories among the inward phenomena 
emotions like sensations are felt as pleasurable 
or painful but they also have no proper objects 
for what are called objects of desire are known 
to us not by our emotions but by our perceptions 
or conceptions which inform us of things suited 
to rouse emotion the other order of inward 
phenomena is that of thoughts divided into con 
ceptions and relations these last are also 
among the categories they are divided into 
relations of coexistence of succession and of 
resemblance a classification which holds good as 
we have seen whether relation be taken in the 
restricted sense of a mental phenomenon look 
ing to two other mental phenomena or gene 
rally of something common to two other things 
now of the relations of coexistence some 



 introduction to bigntal philosophy 

necessarily suppose space as relations of position 
others number as the rules of arithmetic and 
both of these quantity while relations of suc 
cession necessarily suppose time but space 
number time and quantity are among the 
categories 

lastly conceptions are either simple or com 
pound our knowledge of the former is obtained 
by analyzing the latter which are divided into 
conceptions of substances with their qualities 
and what i call conceptions of modes or modi 
fications of things which do not necessarily 
suppose substance namely of space time and 
number from the conceptions of individual 
substances and different species of substances 
with their respective qualities we rise to the 
conception of substance in general which alone 
remained to complete our eight categories 

thus it appears that all the eight categories 
and as far as we can see no others have mental 
phenomena corresponding to them phenomena 
of which those are the objects and if so the 
correctness of the above enumeration of cate 
gories is confirmed 

let us now compare the various sciences with 
the categories above given for this purpose i 
shall take that classification of the sciences 
which i published some time ago and which had 



the categories 

engaged my attention for years long before i 
thought of these categories according to that 
classification the sciences are divided into the 
mental the physical and the mathematical or 
metaphysics physics and mathematics the 
mental sciences treat either of the substance 
mind or of its dualities relations and phe 
nomena all of which are included in the cate 
gories while the physical sciences treat of the 
substance body its qualities and relations 
which also are contained in the same lastly 
mathematics treat of quantity whether of space 
time or number and these make up the rest of 
the categories 

the book of categories divided into fifteen 
chapters forms the first part of aristotles great 
work on logic — the organon notwithstanding 
an eminent logician of the present day and 
at the same time a great admirer of aristotle 
maintains that the doctrine of the categories 
belongs not to pure logic because it treats of 
things it cannot be denied however that the 
doctrine of names appertains to pure logic and 
if so the classification of names therefore the 
categories of names at least belong to pure 
logic but the categories of names are the 
same as the categories of things and in classify 
ing the one we classify the other also a name 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

without a thing corresponding to it is a contra 
diction mere articulate sounds expressed by 
letters and syllables such as fanfarom are not 
names for they stand for no thing con 
sequently the categories do belong to pure logic 
indeed the doctrine of the categories belongs 
to that branch of philosophy which i have called 
philosophia prima as well as to pure logic it is 
the connecting link between them philosophia 
prima or primary logic treats as we have seen 
of the first principles of human knowledge the 
fundamental principles of belief and it must 
also include the elements of all knowledge the 
categories of things pure logic on the other 
hand begins with names and in classifpng them 
classifies things also thus the two sciences 
meet 



proposition the predicables 



proposition the predicables 



the doctrine respecting proposition has been 
involved in some obscurity from a want of atten 
tion to three fundamental distinctions for there 
are three important questions which ought to be 
discussed separately the first what is a pro 
position what is the definition of a proposition 
in general 

i a proposition may be considered under 
two points of view we may look more par 
ticularly to the mind which frames it or else to 
the form of words in which it is expressed for 
every proposition supposes a mental act and a 
verbal expression or what comes to the same 
thing we may attend chiefly to the mental opera 
tion necessary to a proposition or else to the 
formal result the first belongs to the province 
of the pure metaphysician the second to that of 
the logician and grammarian it appertains 
then to pure metaphysics to determine the nature 

u 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

of those faculties necessary to form a proposi 
tion while to logic and grammar belongs the 
result viz the proposition itself now as con 
ception and judgment are universally allowed to 
be indispensable to the framing of any proposition 
and as the latter of these faculties supposes the 
former as moreover there is no proposition 
without words it follows that metaphysically a 
proposition may be defined a judgment expressed 
in words 

this though a correct metaphysical definition 
will not be of any use until judgment itself be 
defined and therefore we must adopt another 
method of ascertaining the nature of a proposi 
tion while the metaphysician analyzes the 
phenomena of mind in order to determine the 
nature of judgment the logician must analyze 
propositions themselves as examples take the 
following — 

 man is mortal 

 the elephant is long lived 

 the lion is carnivorous 

 the hare is timid 

 courage is admired 

 virtue is esteemed 

 generosity is beloved 

 deer are not carnivorous 

 cowardice is not respected 



proposition the prbdicables 

 napoleon was not a saint 

 washington was not an usurper 

 brutus killed caesar 

 antony loved cleopatra 

 alexander conquered darius 

 the three angles of a triangle are equal 
to two right lines 

 any two sides of a triangle are together 
greater than the third side 

 the french convention treated louis 
xvi cruelly 

 the chamber of peers condemned ney 
to death ungenerously 

 italy may be free 

 no one can say 

 napoleon might have conquered russia 
all these however different will be universally 

allowed to be propositions and if so there must 
be something common to them all 

in the first place they are all composed of 
words and of words which taken together make 
perfect sense one of them being a verb in short 
they are all sentences but there are sentences 
such as a question a prayer a command which 
are not propositions secondly each of these 
propositions has two extremes or terms as they 
are called such as man and mortal generosity 
and beloved brutus and killed ccesar three 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

angles of a triangle and equal to two right 
angles c one of which is called the subject 
the other the predicate thirdly these two 
terms are connected by means of a verb which 
is sometimes the simple copula or sign of affir 
mation is at other times a word of a more com 
pound signification such as killed loved conquered 
which involves an affirmation and may be ana 
lyzed into was the killer of was the lover of was 
the conqueror of sometimes to the verb is added 
the sign of denial not sometimes other words 
which modify the sense such as equal to and 
greater than cruelly ungenerously or some mo 
dification of the verb is used as may be can say 
or might have from all this it follows that a 
proposition may be defined to be a sentence or 
combination of words with meaning whereby some 
thing is affirmed or denied of some other thing 
either simply or with some modification 

this is the proper logical definition of a 
proposition the metaphysical definition of the 
same being as above stated a judgment expressed 
in words 

the logical definition might be expressed 
more shortly but rather obscurely as a sentence 
declaratory or enunciative diflferent modes of 
declaration are called in grammar moods as the 
indicative subjunctive potential optative the 



proposition the prbdicablbs 

close connection between logic and grammar 
everywhere appears 

from the above we see that every proposition 
must have two terms at least but there are 
sentences which all allow to be propositions 
though they seem to have only one term such as 
it rains it snows it thunders and god is the 
lion exists c with respect to the first class 
of these we may observe that the indefinite word 
it refers to some subject or other understood 
though it does not at once appear to what subject 
whether sky cloud or air the pronoun it came 
to be used either for brevity or because the 
proper subject was doubtful but it evidently 
points to something and the phrase it rains is 
exactly equivalent to the sky rains or the cloud 
or the air rains again the word rains is an 
abbreviation of is raining and the one may be 
substituted for the other without the least in 
accuracy therefore at full the sentence it rains 
becomes the air or sky or cloud is raining which 
is a proposition in due form 

as to the second class of propositions ap 
parently incomplete god is the lion exists c 
we must remember that the word is has two 
distinct meanings sometimes it is a mere copula 
the sign of affirmation connecting the predicate 
with the subject as when we say a triangle is a 



 introductiom to mental philobopht 

three sided figure but at other times it compre 
hends besides this the notion of real existence 
thus the sentence god is means god eofistsy or 
at full god is eaisting which is a regular proposi 
tion in like manner the lion exists is equivalent 
to the lion is existing and so with all other 
propositions of the sort in which real existence 
is predicated of something whether by means of 
the verb to be or of the less ambiguous verb to 
exist 

as there are some propositions which seem to 
contain less than two terms so are there others 
or compound propositions which contain more 
than two but these can all be resolved into 
simple ones thus the compound proposition 
brutus and ccissius waged war with octamus and 
antony comprehends the following simple propo 
sitions — 

brutus waged war with octavius 

brutus waged war with antony 

cassius waged war with octavius 

cassius waged war with antony 
those two together waged war with these two 
together 

this example may suffice to show how com 
pound propositions may be analyzed here we 
see that the first particle and replaces one entire 
proposition the second and two propositions the 



proposition the predicable 

two taken together one more so that this one 
compound proposition contains five simple 

xl having determined the nature of a pro 
position and having seen that it is always 
composed of two terms at least connected 
together by an affirmative or negative copula the 
second principal question presents itself viz 
what things may be signified by those terms 

now whatever may be of itself an object of 
thought and as such can receive a fully signifi 
cant name may be the subject or predicate of a 
proposition for of such an object something or 
other may be affirmed or denied or that object 
may itself be affirmed or denied of something 
else therefore the terms of all propositions 
must correspond to one or other of the cate 
gories of things which we have already deter 
mined 

with reference to things compared there 
must then be at least as many sorts of pro 
positions as there are categories thus we 
may have propositions where mental phenomena 
are compared with mental phenomena spirit with 
spirit body with body quality with quality 
relation with relation quantity with quantity 
space with space time with time and number 
with number 

this only we must remember that while the 



 imtboducnoh to mkhtal vhnjobophy 



subject of a propositioii may be either a general 
or a singular name as man is a religious being 
socrates was a moral philosopher die predicate 
must be general for predication means that 
something common to many things is affirmed or 
denied of one or more no proposition then 
can exist without a general term we can make 
no proposition out of proper names alone but 
only the unmeaning form of socrates is or was 
not solon 

when we consider attentively these various 
sorts of propositions we shall find however that 
they may be reduced to a smaller number all 
propositions relative to mind and its phenomena 
may be properly considered as forming but one 
class that of mental propositions all relative to 
body its qualities and relations another under 
the name of physical propositions while those 
which relate to quantity whether of space time 
or number may be called mathematical proposi 
tions a classification exactly corresponding to 
that of the sciences 

according to this view the above eight cate 
gories might be reduced to three mind body 
quantity under one or other of which all things 
might be comprehended in this view under 
the term mind would be comprised not only the 
permanent thing or substance spirit but also 



proposition the predicable 

its qualities and its fugitive phenomena under 
body not only the substance body but all its 
qualities and relations while all the relations 
of space time and number would be compre 
hended under quantity 

but whether we adopt this classification of 
categories or not as preferable to that before 
given the division of propositions into mental 
physical and mathematical seems agreeable to 
the nature of things as well as to the natural 
division of the sciences which are made up of 
propositions and of nothing else other propo 
sitions no doubt there are of a mixed nature 
such as all those relative to the influence of 
mind on body or of body on mind where 
the things are widely different though there be a 
relation between them these may be called 
mixed propositions the terms corresponding to 
things belonging to different categories 

we see from the above the futility of those 
discussions which have so much occupied lo 
gicians respecting the terms of a proposition 
whether they correspond to ideas to things or 
to names some propositions it is clear relate 
to ideas others to things different from ideas 
in the proposition ambition is a more durable 
passion than love it is quite evident that the 
terms ambition and love stand for emotions 

x 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

which are feelings or mental phenomena but 
in the proposition gold is heavier than lead it is 
no less evident that the terms gold and lead 
stand for material substances which all mankind 
believe whether with or without reason to have 
an independent existence without the mind 
true it is that gold and lead are known to us 
only through our sensations and perceptions 
and that we can form no proposition respecting 
them but through the notions of our mind 
but the common observer as well as the physi 
cal enquirer does not stop to analyze the notion 
as the metaphysician does but he passes on at 
once to the material object of that he thinks 
concerning that he forms an opinion and makes 
a proposition can any one really maintain that 
there is no difference in the terms of the two 
propositions above stated that gold and lead no 
less than love and ambition stand for ideas or 
mental phenomena and nothing else surely 
common sense is sufficient to settle this question 
without entering upon the grounds of our con 
viction it is certain that in speaking of gold and 
silver we speak of things which we believe to be 
distinct from the mind and its phenomena 

one very celebrated metaphysician has main 
tained that in all propositions the terms of com 

 hobbes 



proposition the predicable 

parison are names and nothing but names 
let us examine the meaning of this statement 
and see how it applies to suppose that in the 
proposition ambition is a more durable passion 
than love all we assert is that the name ambition 
is more durable than the name love is an ab 
surdity too palpable to be maintained by any one 
do we then compare the meaning of the names 
and do we assert that the meaning of the name 
ambition is more durable than the meaning of 
the name love this also is an absurdity we 
must assert then that the name ambition means 
something which is more durable than what is 
meant by the name love the question then 
comes to be do we here assert that the name 
ambition in the proper that is in the usual 
signification of words implies a passion more 
durable than love as a part of its definition 
or do we assert a new fact not supposed to be 
included in the common sense of the word if 
the former then our proposition is one relating 
to the meaning of a word or verbal if the latter 
then our proposition is real where one thing is 
compared with another thing not a name with a 
meaning or thing for this is a verbal pro 
position where the two terms are a name a mere 
name and a thing and the assertion is that the 
one is or is not generally employed to mean the 



 intboducnon to mental philpht 

other to which of these kinds of propositions 
ambition is more durable than love belongs 
the reader will at once determine and if this be 
a real proposition then all propositions are not 
verbal 

though all propositions be not verbal yet 
some are a verbal proposition as we have said 
is one where one of the terms is a mere name 
and the other a name or names suggesting a 
thing so that even in verbal propositions one 
of the terms is a thing thus in the verbal 
proposition a triangle is a figure with three sides 
and three angles the assertion is that the word 
triangle either in ordinary discourse or else in 
books of science means the thing here described 
the word triangle may be supposed to convey no 
meaning at all before one meets with this pro 
position it is a collection of letters an articulate 
sound but it may be nothing else this pro 
position makes it a true word that is gives it a 
meaning which it had not before states a thing 
to which by convention it is applicable such is 
a verbal proposition 

though some verbal propositions are alto 
gether trifling the bane of science and the source 
of endless and unprofitable disputes because 
they are not at once seen to be verbal yet we 
must not suppose that all verbal propositions are 



proposition the pbedicable 

vain and futile on the contrary some of the 
most important propositions are strictly verbal 
such are all definitions the object of a defi 
nition such as that of a triangle above given is 
to give a meaning a definite meaning to a word 
before supposed either to have none or one un 
certain and fluctuating consequently a name 
a mere name is one term of the proposition and 
a name or names which stand for things is 
another now in order to determine to what 
things a name should be applicable we must 
have clear notions of the nature of things their 
resemblances and differences for to things simi 
lar we give a common name to things different 
different names therefore a good definition 
often requires a long and painful investigation 
into the nature of things and ought to be not 
the beginning but the end of our inquiries the 
summing up of all that we have learnt thus it 
appears that definitions though verbal proposi 
tions are not inferior in importance to real 

some verbal propositionsare evidently so but 
not all where one of the names is a new 
word suggesting nothing then any assertion con 
cerning it must be seen to be verbal but where 
both are old and well known we are apt to think 
that neither requires definition and therefore 
that whatever is said of one of them must be a 
fact not referring to the meaning of the name 



 introduction to mental philofiopht 

since verbal propositions are so insidious it 
becomes very desirable to have some ready 
criterion whereby we may discover them as 
one criterion i may mention the employment 
of a definition if a dispute be at once termi 
nated by a definition then we may be sure that 
the proposition contested is purely verbal sup 
pose the question to be whether prudence be a 
virtue define virtue and the dispute is settled 
at once therefore the question is verbal 

i may suggest another criterion since the 
simple copula is is alone employed in definition 
and alone necessary wherever we find a proposi 
tion containing that copula as the only verb there 
we should be on our guard substitute for the 
verb the word means or the words means same 
thing comprehended under the meaning of and if 
the proposition then make sense we may be 
sure that it is verbal 

thus in the proposition a triangle is a figure 
with three sides and three angles substitute 
means for is and the sense is the same so in 
the proposition prudence is a virtue substitute 
the other phrase and we have prudence means 
something comprehended under the meaning of 
virtue which is also sense both these then are 
verbal propositions but substitute either of 
these phrases in the proposition ambition is a 



profositiony the predicables 

more durable passion than love and the result 
is nonsense this therefore is not a verbal pro 
position ambition may be a more durable 
passion than love but certainly that is not the 
meaning of the word ambition 

wherever the predicate contains the whole of 
the definition there the copula is or means is em 
ployed but where it contains only a part of the 
definition there the longer form of words must 
be used thus in the proposition a triangle 
is or means a figure with three sides and three 
angles the predicate is a complete definition 
while in this prudence is a virtue i e means 
something comprehended under the meaning of 
virtue the predicate is only a part of the defini 
tion the genus of which prudence is a species 

we must here observe that the distinctions of 
propositions into mental physical and mathe 
matical into real and verbal are metaphysical 
not logical distinctions for they relate to the 
nature of things which the terms stand for 
whereas piue logic looks only to the form or 
expression thus in pure logic propositions 
are divided into categorical and hrpothetical 
according as they enounce absolutely or under 
a condition as man is a rational animal is 
categorical the boy may learn hypothetical 
propositions are again divided in pure logic 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

into affirmative and negative universal and 
particular words which explain themselves these 
distinctions need not here be dwelt upon as they 
are found in all books of logic but what is 
necessary to attend to is the difference between 
the logical and the metaphysical nature of pro 
positions it is the latter of these that i here 
treat of 

it was necessary in the first instance to 
determine the nature of a proposition both 
metaphysically and logically and to define it 
accordingly but the rest of this article relates 
to propositions considered metaphysically the 
logical divisions of propositions and the logi 
cal predicables also as we shall see presently 
must not be confounded with the metaphysical 
divisions and the metaphysical predicables 

here it may not be out of place to remark 
once for all that the word metaphysical is used 
in three different senses at least which may be 
determined by the context we shall know the 
meaning of the word by considering to what it is 
opposed when metaphysical is opposed to 
physical or material it means mental in this 
sense metaphysics is sometimes called psychology 
but when metaphysical is opposed to logical 
then as on the one hand logical refers to con 
sistent thinking metaphysical on the other relates 



proposition the predicables 

to the correspondence between our thoughts and 
the nature of things in this sense metaphysi 
cal and real are synonymous logical truth is 
sometimes called subjective as confined to the 
subject who thinks and metaphysical objective 
as relating to an object either really distinct or 
considered for the time as distinct from the sub 
ject lastly metaphysical sometimes means 
nothing more than ewact and metaphysically true 
is exactly true thus mr james mill in his 
elements of political economy says the objec 
tion is not only practically immaterial it is 
metaphysically unsound 

ii l having determined the nature of a pro 
position in general and also having seen what 
the two terms of a proposition stand for what 
things they are meant to represent it now 
remains in the third place to ascertain what it is 
which we affirm or deny concerning these things 
this is the doctrine of predication or of the 
predicables as it is commonly called in books of 
logic an acquaintance with which will complete 
what is here necessary to be known with respect 
to propositions we have seen that in every 
proposition there are at least two terms and that 
the thing suggested by one of these terms is 
affirmed or denied of the thing suggested by the 
other but this we cannot do with meaning 

y 



 introduction to meital philosopst 

unless we see that there is or is not some relation 
between them the feeling of relation is dis 
tinguished from conception by this that it 
necessarily implies three mental states two con 
ceptions and the relative feeling which connects 
them so the objects which correspond to those 
conceptions are considered either each alone and 
separate or else as bearing one upon the other 
as somehow connected or related now what a 
proposition sets forth in words is that such and 
such a relation does or does not subsist between 
two things which are named in short there are 
two things and not one alone mentioned and an 
assertion is made concerning these two things 
that they have or have not something in common 
consequently what is asserted or predicated is a 
relation 

this being determined our task may be con 
sidered as nearly accomplished for we have 
already considered the subject of relation and 
the various kinds thereof relations we have 
seen are either of coexistence of succession or 
of resemblance and consequently if predication 
mean the affirmation or denial of a relation then 
in every proposition what we affirm or deny is 
that some coexistence or some succession or 
some resemblance subsists between two things 
such is the nature of predication and these are 
three predicables 



proposition the predicables 

are these then the only predicables if all 
propositions contained two terms respecting two 
things really different and not one and the same 
then every affirmation or denial concerning them 
would be the predication of some relation which 
would be one either of coexistence of succession 
or of resemblance but there are some proposi 
tions regular in form and real as to matter in 
which the two terms stand for one and the same 
thing when i say this is the man whom i met 
yesterday i state two propositions both regular 
and taken together instructive though the terms 
of the first stand for the same thing the same 
individual man but between an individual and 
the same individual there cannot be properly 
speaking any relation for relation supposes two 
things and not one only therefore to meet 
such cases as this we must allow another pre 
dicable distinct from those above mentioned viz 
that of identity or sameness meaning by this 
real sameness and not merely close resemblance 
as the word often signifies propositions pre 
dicating identity may no doubt be verbal but 
they are not so necessarily when i say this 
is the man who won the prize the proposition 
or rather the propositions are real but when i 
state that setubal and saint ubes are the same 
what i affirm is that the proper names setubal 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

and saint ubes denote the same place an affirma 
tion evidently verbal 

we must not confound propositions predicat 
ing identity with those which have been called 
identical propositions such as a square is a 
square a man is a man an elephant is an ele 
phant wherein a term is affirmed of itself these 
are the very perfection of trifling for they give us 
no information even as to the meaning of names 
but it is unnecessary to add one word to what 
locke has written on these frivolous propositions 

there is still another sort of propositions 
where we look in vain for any proper relation 
between two things this is the case where ex 
istence alone is predicated god is is assuredly 
a proposition and one of vast importance though 
in form it be so simple it is as we have seen 
equivalent to god exists or is existing or 
 is an existing being a proposition in which it 
is not easy to trace any coexistence succession 
or resemblance if god is were equivalent to 
 god is one of existing beings then it might be 
said that the proposition stated a resemblance be 
tween god and other beings a resemblance in 
their common existence though this would be far 
fetched but god is does not seem to refer to 
any other being it is as far as possible an abso 
lute proposition therefore to those predicables 



proposition the predicadles 

before mentioned we must now add that of ex 
istence the complete list of the predicables 
will then be relation whether of coewistence 
succession or resemblance identity existence 

is it possible to explain what we mean by 
existence or is our notion thereof too simple to 
admit of analysis with the word existence is 
often joined the word real as if real existence 
were different from existence simply real 
existence then may admit of analysis though 
existence do not by real existence i conceive 
we mean substantial existence existence as a 
substance that is as something permanent 
among innumerable modifications now sub 
stances are of two sorts spirit and body and 
therefore real existence means existence as a 
spirit or as a body 

simple existence seems to me to defy analysis 
many things are allowed to exist which have 
no real or substantial existence such as the 
thoughts which flit across our mind even time 
and space are said to exist though wherein 
empty space differs from nothing no one can 
tell and if time and space exist then do their 
modifications exist and the figures of mathe 
matics exist though not bodily on the other 
hand we can conceive things which no one now 
allows to exist as centaur mermaid land unicorn 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

these are said to exist only in idea or in imagina 
tion that is the idea exists but nothing corres 
ponding thereto absolutely nothing but when 
we say that mathematical triangles and squares 
do not exist all we mean is that they do not 
exist bodily we allow that they exist somehow 
though how we cannot tell we do not look upon 
them as chimeras centaurs and unicorns which 
have no sort of existence 

when existence is predicated of any thing 
real existence is almost always meant thus god 
is means god exists as a substantial or per 
manent being endowed with innumerable attri 
butes the question whether time and space 
exist may be regarded as at bottom but verbal 
or a question as to the applicability of the word 
exists though like many other verbal disputes 

it touches hard upon things for if by denying 

 

that space and time and the figures of mathe 
matics exist we are led to infer that the science 
of mathematics has no base a question that 
might seem but verbal becomes raised to one of 
real importance 

these then we propose as a list of the predi 
cables of all that can be affirmed or denied of 
any thing when we affirm that the wild rose 
has five petals we state a relation of co 
existence when we say opium causes sleep 



propobitiony the predicables 

we bring forward a relation of succession in 
this case of cause and effect when we assert 
that a bat is like a bird or that blue is like 
green we enounce a relation of resemblance 
when we say this is the same man who kept the 
inn ten years ago we declare identity and 
lastly when we conclude from the innumerable 
proofs of design in the universe that there is a 
god we proclaim his real existence 

 i shall conclude this subject with a few 
remarks on some former lists of fredicables 
the most ancient and the most celebrated of 
these is contained in prophyrys introduction 
to the categories which for many ages was 
adopted by logicians as the standard work on 
this subject adopted as of equal authority with 
the organon of aristotle to which it was prefixed 
according to this famous classification all that 
could be predicated of any thing was its 

genus 

species 

specific difference or differentia 
some property 
or some accident of the same 

when i say a triangle is a figure i pre 
dicate the genus to which triangle belongs 
when i state a triangle is a figure with three 
sides and three angles i enounce the species 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

when i affirm a triangle has three sides and three 
angles i mention the difference which distin 
guishes it from other species of the same genus 
figure when i declare that in every triangle 
any two of the sides are together greater than 
the third side i assert a property and when i 
observe this triangle is large i state an 
accident 

now what first strikes us with respect to this 
famous classification is that three of these pre 
dicables are applicable only to verbal propositions 
i e to propositions concerning the signification 
of names the first three are all about definition 
and nothing else in saying that a triangle is a 
figure i so far define a triangle as to distinguish 
it from a host of other things which are not 
figures and in stating farther that it is a figure 
with three sides and three angles i complete the 
definition by mentioning how it differs from other 
figures but in all this the question is merely 
as to the meaning of the word triangle as to 
what it is used to represent so when i say that 
a man is an animal or a rational animal i state 
only what the name man generally means what 
it is supposed usually to suggest i affirm nothing 
more in short the genus is a part of the defi 
nition the specific difference is the other part 
and the two together make up the complete 



proposition the predicables 

definition of the species so that one and all give 
only the meaning of names and their place in 
the scale of classification as genus or species 
therefore these three ought to be excluded from 
a list of real predicables whereby some informa 
tion is afforded not comprised in the received 
signification of a name in opposition to the 
latter the former may be called verbal predicables 
real predicables belong to metaphysics verbal 
to logic 

the case of property is different a pro 
perty supposes something not contained in the 
definition of the name though it constantly 
accompanies the thing signified that any two 
sides of a triangle are together greater than the 
third side is always true but the truth is not 
comprised in the meaning of the word triangle 
nay three previous mathematical propositions 
are required to prove it so when we say that 
heat causes expansion we state a property of 
heat certainly not comprehended under the usual 
meaning of the word 

thus as we see there are properties of two 
kinds one where uniform coexistence another 
where uniform succession or causation is an 
nounced the property of triangles above men 
tioned is a case of the former sort that of heat 
of the latter property then taken in its largest 

z 



 introduction to mental philput 

sense comprehends the relation of uniform co 
existence as well as of uniform succession 

lastly as to accident accidents are divided 
by logicians into inseparable and separable an 
inseparable accident is something which so far 
as we have observed always attends a subject 
but which we could conceive to be wanting 
without the loss of the characteristics peculiar 
to the subject or of any properties thereto be 
longing thus we may have never seen nor 
heard of any but white swans but we can 
conceive birds similar in all other respects to 
swans and having all the properties of the same 
except whiteness there is nothing evidently 
absurd in the line of the poet 

 rara avis in terris nigroque simiuima cygno 

as there would be if whiteness were either in 
cluded in our definition of swans or supposed to 
be of necessity inseparable from them 

from this it appears that an inseparable 
accident is nearly allied to a property and in 
many cases it would probably be difficult to 
distinguish the two at all events the accident 
like a property is something supposed at least 
to be uniform whether it be so actually or not 
generally some uniform coexistence as of the 
colour whiteness with the other properties of 
the swan 



proposition the predicables ll 

a separable accident on the other hand is 
not always found even within the limited range 
of our experience not in all the individuals of a 
species not even in the same individual at all 
times there is a flower called lychnis dioica or 
bachelors button some specimens of which in the 
wild state are red others white though of the 
same species colour then here is a separable 
accident john is at dinner expresses an ac 
cident separable even from the individual for 
john is not always at dinner a separable 
accident then differs from an inseparable accident 
as well as from a property in this that it is not 
an invariable but a casual coexistence or a 
casual succession of things 

upon the whole it appears from this inquiry 
that the first three of the scholastic predicables 
are merely verbal while the two latter if largely 
understood comprise a great part of the pre 
dicables which i have proposed identity how 
ever and real existence find no place in the old 
classification thus the old classification of 
predicables is neither a purely formal general 
ization as it has been styled by a very high 
authority in logic nor yet entirely real but 
partly the one partly the other the first three 

 see notes to reids brief account of aristotles logic 
p of reids works edited by sir william hamilton 



 intkoduction to mental philosophy 

of these predicables are logical formal or 
verbal the two latter metaphysical or real 

in the essay concerning human understand 
ing locke reduces all that can be affirmed or 
denied about two things one of another or in 
his language about two ideas to four heads viz 
 identity or diversity relation coexist 
ence or necessary connexion real existence 
with respect to the first identity it appears by 
lockes own explanation that he meant not 
identity properly so called or absolute sameness 
but close resemblance it is clear also from the 
context that under coexistence or necessary 
connection he included invariable succession or 
sequence in time for as an instance of coexist 
ence he brings forward the fact that iron is 
susceptible of magnetical impressions and he 
openly allows that identity in his sense of close 
resemblance and coexistence are truly nothing 
but relations of a peculiar kind indeed and 
therefore as he thinks to be classed apart from 
relations in general therefore these predicables 
of locke though diflferently classed comprehend 
in reality nothing different from mine and all 
mine with one exception that of absolute identity 
or sameness which he has omitted 

hume in his first work a treatise of human 

 book iv chap 



proposition the predicable 

nature observes that it may perhaps be 
esteemed an endless task to enumerate all these 
qualities which make objects admit of comparison 
and by which the ideas of philosophical relation 
are produced but if we diligently consider 
them we shall find that without difficulty they 
may be comprised under seven general heads 
which may be considered as the sources of all 
philosophical relation he then proceeds to 
enumerate these seven which are resemblance 
 identity relations of space and time 
 relations of quantity and number de 
grees of quality contrariety the rela 
tion of cause and effect now the first and 
second of these are contained in my classifica 
tion the third and fourth come under the more 
general head of relations of coexistence while 
the fifth and seventh are included under rela 
tions of succession there remains then only 
the relation of contrariety which is but a striking 
difference a difference which always supposes 
some resemblance were there no resemblance 
there would be no contrast a dwarf contrasts 
well with a giant less with an elephant and not 
at all with a mountain contrariety then is in 
cluded under resemblance it supposes resem 
blance in some particulars perhaps in many the 

 book i sect 



 intbofductlon to mental philosophy 

absence of it in others but the mere absence of 
a relation is no new relation 

in truth resemblance as much supposes dif 
ference as diflperence resemblance when we 
say that one thing resembles another we in fact 
affirm that they are not one and the same and 
if not the same or identical there must be dif 
ferences as well as resemblances the mind of 
one man resembles that of another but how 
many are the diflferences the idea which the 
same man is conscious of at one time may be as 
like as possible to the idea which he holds at 
another but still there must be between them 
the difference in the time of their appearance 

upon the whole then it appears that the pre 
dicables of hume are fundamentally the same as 
mine only differently arranged with one excep 
tion that of real existence which he has omitted 
probably as not agreeable to his sceptical views 
locke mentions real existence which uume 
omits while hume mentions absolute identity 
omitted by locke 

lastly mr mill in his system of logic enu 
merates existence coexistence sequence causa 
tion and resemblance and observes that one or 
other of these is asserted or denied in every pro 
position without exception this classification 

 system of logic book i chap 



proposition the pbedicabubs 

differs from the one proposed above in two par 
ticulars first by classing causation apart from 
sequence under which i have comprehended it 
and secondly by omitting identity this last 
then is the only important difference 

with these remarks i conclude the subject of 
proposition and the predicables 



 introduction to mental philosopht 



reasoning 



god has given to man two grand means for 
the advancement of knowledge and the discovery 
of truth observation and reasoning some 
truths are learnt by observation alone as par 
ticular facts submitted to the senses others by 
reasoning alone as the truths of pure mathema 
tics others again and by far the greater number 
by observation and reasoning together all men 
know what is meant by observation suffice it 
then to remark that observation is of two kinds 
the one exercised upon phenomena over which 
we have no control the other upon changes 
which we ourselves have induced the former 
may be called natural the latter artificial obser 
vation for it is exercised upon experiments 

though all men know what observation is 
but few comparatively know how to observe to the 
best advantage for observation simply is of 
very limited use it may certainly prevent us 



reasonmo 

from falling into a pit or sinking in a quagmire 
before our eyes but unless some inference be 
drawn from it no general truth no science can 
be established consequently observation is 
useful chiefly as a ground for inference or 
reasoning and in common discourse as well as 
in many popular works they are so blended that 
it does not readily appear where the one ends 
and the other begins facts and inferences from 
facts are continually confounded by inaccurate 
speakers and writers 

the nature of reasoning and its different 
kinds are not so generally understood though 
as we shall afterwards find there are different 
sorts of reasoning yet there must be something 
common to all or the name reasoning would 
never have been given to the process in all cases 
our first question then is what is common to all 
reasoning 

i all reasoning is concerned with tracing 
the relations of things and inferring a certain 
relation of two things from a relation of two or 
more other things such in metaphysical lan 
guage is the business of reasoning in logical 
language the same is expressed otherwise and 
from one or more propositions we are said to 
infer another what then is common to all 
reasoning is that belief in one or more relations 

a a 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

or when expressed in words in one or more pro 
positions leads us on immediately to the belief of 
another relation or another proposition as a 
cause leads on to its effect 

in all reasoning then some relation or rela 
tions or when stated in words some proposition 
or propositions are granted and these are called 
the premises from which another relation or 
another proposition is inferred that is called the 
conclusion 

thus in order to understand thoroughly the 
nature of reasoning we must know what is 
meant by a relation and a prapositian but these 
terms have already been explained in full 
suffice it here to repeat that a relation differs 
from a perception or a conception in this that 
it necessarily supposes two things between which 
a relation is felt that the relation as felt is a 
state of mind quite distinct from the conceptions 
out of which it arises and that as conceptions 
are various so are relations 

these last may all however be classed under 
three heads 

i relations of coexistence 

ii relations of succession 

according as they do not or do involve the 
notion of time and 

 see these words in philosophical vocahulary part i 



iii relations of resemblance which may 
or may not involve the notion of time 

the relations of coexistence are various 
such as 

 relations of position 

 relations of comprehension or of a 
whole to its parts 

 relations of quantity or more equal 
less which may be called ewact relations in 
contradistinction to 

 relations of indeterminate degree 

 relations of succession on the other hand 
are either of invariable succession or of casual 
succession 

these distinctions will be useful to us in de 
termining the different kinds of reasoning but 
in the mean time they are sufficient to show how 
vast is the field which it embraces 

ii among the relations now enumerated 
those of quantity deserve peculiar attention as 
they alone are ewact relations whereby they are 
clearly distinguished from all others and as the 
relations are exact so likewise is the reasoning 
built upon them all reasoning therefore may 
be divided into two sorts the demonstrative or 
strictly a priori reasoning and the probable or 
strictly a posteriori reasoning the one indepen 
dent of experience the other dependent thereon 
either immediately or remotely demonstrative 



 introduction to bfental philosophy 

reasoning is confined to mathematics or the 
science of quantity and contrary to what is 
often thought is not founded on general prin 
ciples or axioms but on selfevident particular 
truths the evidence of the propositions of 
euclid does not rest upon the axioms placed at 
the beginning of the work but upon the par 
ticular instances of those axioms which occur in 
any proposition thus when in the first propo 
sition we show that in the triangle 




abc the side a b is equal to the side b c 
and the side a c to b c we conclude at once 
without the intervention of any general axiom 
that the side a b is equal to the side a c the 
general axiom that things which are equal to the 
same are equal to one another cannot make the 
conclusion one whit more evident than it was 
before we see at once from the particular data 
that such must be the conclusion or if we do 
not no general axiom can convince us the 
truth then of the propositions of euclid does 
not rest upon the axioms nor were they first 
demonstrated from these the axioms are placed 
there pro forma and give a more scientific air to 
the whole but they are not necessary 



reasoning 

as particulars must be known before we can 
generalize so particular instances of the truth 
that things which are equal to the same are 
equal to one another must have been noticed 
before we could state it in the form of an uni 
versal axiom not that the axiom is proved by 
an induction of particulars as some affirm but 
only that particulars were necessary to allow us 
to conceive the general proposition as soon as 
conceived its truth is selfevident still less if in 
such a matter degree were possible is the general 
proposition required to prove the particular 
instances in like manner having proved any 
proposition of euclid in a particular case the 
mind instantly generalizes the truth for it sees 
that what has been proved in the instance before 
it must hold good in all other instances where 
the data are exactly similar 

all the reasonings of pure mathematics are 
demonstrative and the conclusions arrived at are 
alone certain and eternal for first they start 
from selfevident or necessary truths and the 
mind sees that they are and always must be so 
secondly the names employed are names of 
universals which exist not as real matters of 
fact thirdly these universals belong to cluantity 
alone and so admit of an exact definition or in 
other words they can be accurately distinguished 
one from another and lastly the deductions from 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

these selferident truths and these definitions are 
seen at each step to he also irresistihle and un 
changeahle even hy omnipotence 

since each step in the deduction is selfevi 
dent as well as the first position the conclusion 
must be true 

why do the relations of quantity or of 
equality and inequality alone admit of demon 
stration because the modes or modifications 
of quantity alone can be accurately distinguished 
one is as distinct from two as from two thousand 
this is the case with no other modes other 
modes admit of indefinite graduation not so those 
of quantity these do not shade off one into 
another it is on account of this indefinite 
graduation that other relations are not susceptible 
of demonstration 

taking the above as a specimen jof demon 
strative reasoning in general and it may be so 
taken without any danger of error we see that 
two previous propositions are necessary to esta 
blish any mathematical conclusion first we 
have a b equal to b c then a c equal to b c 
and lastly a b equal to a c b c may be called 
the middle term or medium of comparison be 
tween a b and a c 

the range of certainty is very limited com 

 see article quantity in first part philosophical vocabulary 



brasomina 

prising only the pure mathematics for even 
mechanical philosophy which uses demonstrative 
reasoning is based upon experience and there 
fore it may err though granting certain prin 
ciples such as the laws of motion the deductions 
from these are infallibly true that is to say 
they are infallibly true granting these principles 
and supposing that no others come into play for 
it often happens that the conclusions of the me 
chanical philosopher are wrong in reality because 
there are in nature other principles which he has 
not taken into account even the pure mathe 
matician sometimes arrives at absurd conclusions 
absurd in material nature though true in the 
world of universals for they follow irresistibly 
from his data i e from selfevident truths and 
from his own definitions which correspond not 
with things really existing such a conclusion is 
that of the asymptote or a straight line which 
though continually approaching can never meet 
a certain curve 

 if even perfect ratiocination such as the mathematical 
may lead to conclusions absurd in material nature surely the best 
possible ratiocination on other subjects may also lead to absur 
dities some german philosophers of the present day men of 
much thought have reasoned themselves into pantheism it is 
the business of experience to correct the errors of pure reasoning 
bacon has admirably pointed out the dangers of rationalism as 
well as of empiricism nov org lib i 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

iii all reasonings other than those already 
mentioned lead to probable conclusions only 
because they are all idtimately based upon facts 
known by experience which is always fallible 
for facts may be inaccurately observed wrong 
conclusions may be drawn from them and even 
what once was fact may cease to be so 

although all probable reasonings are based 
ultimately upon facts real or supposed yet they 
do not all arise immediately from the experience 
of particular things which alone is properly ex 
perience some reasonings no doubt do so spring 
but others start from general principles or general 
facts which had been inferred from many particu 
lars by a previous mental operation hence a 
wellmarked distinction between the inductive 
and the dbductive method the one brings in 
particular facts in order to establish a conclusion 
whether general or particular the other from 
some general proposition deduces or draws out 
a less general proposition induction may pro 
ceed not only from particulars to particulars and 
from particulars to the general but also from the 
general to the more general while deduction 
always proceeds from a general proposition to one 
less general the latter is often called a priori 
reasoning in opposition to the former though in 
reality the general proposition from which it 



rbanin 

starts is known only by induction based upon ex 
perience for instance when we speculate on 
the advantages and disadvantages of any form of 
civil government we may either consult the history 
of nations in order to determine the result of 
such a scheme in times past and then conclude 
that the same would follow now and here we 
reason from immediate experience or inductively 
or we may draw our inferences from the acknow 
ledged principles of human nature and in this 
case we reason from remote experience or de 
ductively for the principles of human nature are 
known to us only by experience 

it is evident that both these methods of in 
quiry lead not to infallible but only to probable 
conclusions for besides false accounts of facts 
the connection between the premises namely a 
number of particular effects and the inference 
that such a thing is the cause of these effects 
and of innumerable others similar is never irre 
sistible because there is no selfevident absurdity 
in supposing any thing to be the cause of any 
thing and also because we never can be sure 
that the cases actually tried and those not yet 
tried are in all respects similar and though 
the axioms established by induction be true 
generally yet as they seldom are universally as 
their limits are not defined with perfect accuracy

and as there may be other and counteracting 
principles at work therefore reasoning from 
these general axioms cannot lead to certain 
conclusions 

instance of a general law of nature established 
by induction 

from the fall first of an apple then of other 
bodies to the earth newton inferred first that 
all bodies tend to the earth and then that all the 
bodies in nature tend to each other the earth 
the moon the planets the sun and all that 
therein is in a word that gravitation is universal 

instances of a general practical maxim ob 
tained by induction 

for thisj thou shalt not commit adultery 
thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou 
shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet 
and if there be any other commandment it is 
briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou 
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 

the superiority of a standing army over a 
militia as to warlike efficiency is proved induc 
tively from the history of many nations par 
ticularly of the ancient world when standing 
armies were not universal and when those who 
had them conquered the rest and deductively 
from the general principle of division of labour

reasoning 

there is aa antecedent improbability against 
miracles founded on our experience of the uni 
formity of the course of nature but the truth of 
a particular miracle as the raising of lazarus 
may be proved by particular facts in evidence 
here we have first a deduction then an induc 
tion 

the necessity or at leasts the utility of local 
government in general is proved inductively from 
the history of particular nations some being the 
seat of government others ruled as provinces 
and the same conclusion is arrived at deductively 
from the known principles of human nature 
such as that persons on the spot better under 
stand and are more interested in their own affairs 
than strangers again the utility of local govern 
ment in general being proved the expediency of 
the same in a particular case as in that of 
ireland follows by deduction and a like conclu 
sion is established inductively by a reference to 
the particular history of ireland 

take another specimen of deduction a man 
is accused of a certain crimre say of murdering 
another starting from certain general princi 
ples of human nature or from the previous 
general character of the individual in question 
we argue that it is very improbable that he com 
mitted the murder this is often called a priori 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

reasoning because it draws a conclusion prior to 
an examination of the particular parts of the 
case though in reality it is founded on experi 
ence on experience of human nature in general 
or of the individual more especially afterwards 
many particular facts are brought forward to 
prove that he actually committed the deed and 
from these facts we draw our particular con 
clusion inductively 

what is called analogical reasoning is no 
distinct species but only a variety of inductive 
reasoning it may be called indirect induction 
no better specimen of this can be given than the 
general strain of the reasoning contained in 
butlers analogy of which i shall here give one 
or two instances it is supposed to be known by 
experience that even here there is a moral govern 
ment that the good generally speaking if not 
more prosperous outwardly are more happy in 
wardly than the wicked hence the inference 
that the same will hold good hereafter in other 
words that the future state will be one of rewards 
and punishments according to desert 

again natural religion is attended with great 
difficulties hence it is probable from analogy 
that a system of revealed religion shall not 
be altogether free from them 

our own existence particularly the union of 



reasoning 

soul and body is a great mystery and even seems 
to involve contradictions surely then it is pro 
bable that religion shall have mysteries the soul 
from the nature of spirit can exist in no place 
but we believe that it is united to our body which 
does exist in space that where our body is there 
also is our soul and nowhere else is the mys 
tery of the trinity more incomprehensible than 
this 

since analogy signifies likeness or resem 
blance and analogical reasoning is reasoning 
from like things to like wherein it may be 
asked lies the difference between this and other 
varieties of inductive reasoning for all induc 
tion is from similar to similar whether from 
similar causes we infer similar effects and vice 
versa or whether from likeness in some part of 
the chain we infer likeness in the whole chain 
without knowledge of causes as when from cer 
tain appearances of the sky we predict perhaps 
long beforehand the coming weather or whether 
from certain parts we infer the coexistence of 
other parts as the experienced anatomist who 
from a single bone or even fragment of a bone 
can construct the whole animal inductive 
reasoning is a species of which analogy is a 
variety nqr can we lay down any very definite 
distinction between it and other varieties only 



 intboduction to bfental philosophy 

when along with the similarity there is also a 
good deal of difference there we call the reason 
ing analogical as when we reason from the 
order of things in this life to that in a future 
state perhaps the argument hy which we estab 
lish the existence of the great creator may be 
classed under the same head for the instances 
of design in the universe though palpable and 
innumerable differ in many respects from those 
which we find in the works of man but the 
similarity is sufficient to render the argument 
quite convincing while the differences prove 
only the immeasurable superiority of the great 
first cause 

as a specimen of a chain of deductive rea 
soning take the following — 

the capacity of the mind is limited 

therefore the more it is occupied with one 
thing the less can it be occupied with another 

therefore the more it is taken up with intel 
lectual pursuits the less can it be taken up with 
the affections and vice versa 

therefore sain the more it is occupied with 
general benevolence the less can it be occupied 

 for an admirable specimen of analogical induction see the 
opening chapters of paleys natural theology never was argu 
ment better put man ought to consider it as his greatest 
privilege that he can by reason find out god 



reasonino 

vfith private attachments and vice versa in this 
reasoning each proposition is less general than 
the preceding and each is an inference from what 
went before 

from the above examples and observations 
the distinction between the inductive and the 
deductive method of inquiry seems to be clearly 
established but when we come to examine the 
matter more narrowly we shall perhaps find that 
there is not so much difference between the 
reasonings employed in these two cases as we 
might at first suppose 

let us remark that the term induction com 
prebends two distinct mental operations first 
the obsernng the comparing the selecting of 
facts and secondly an inference drawn from 
them the first part of this process is peculiar 
to induction for deduction collects not particu 
lar facts it states a general proposition but both 
agree in drawing an inference from premises 
now the question is whether this inference bc 
or be not drawn upon the same principle in both 
cases 

in deductive reasoning having stated a 
general proposition our object is to show that the 
particular case which we have in view is really 
comprehended under the general rule so that if 
the one be true so must the other thus our 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

general proposition being that the more the 
mind is occupied with one thing the less can it be 
occupied with another we then consider that in 
tellectual pursuits are an occupation and again 
that the afifections are another occupation 
whence it appears that the less general proposition 
 the more the mind is occupied with intellectual 
pursuits the less can it be occupied with the a£pec 
tions is a case of the general rule or compre 
hended under it 

now how stands the case with inductive 
reasoning suppose a traveller in a new coun 
try to meet with a troop of animals hitherto 
quite unknown to him that he catches one 
kills and dissects it with the skill of a practised 
anatomist one specimen contents him for he 
confidently believes that all the rest so like out 
wardly are also alike inwardly now what 
reason has he for this belief the mental pro 
cess necessary to justify his conclusion seems to 
be as follows 

here is an animal of a certain make there 
are many other animals to all outward appear 
ances exceedingly like to this and to each other 
but nature is uniform in her operations and never 
deceives us by uniting great differences with such 
striking resemblances therefore all these animals 
are alike within as well as without 



reasoning 

here it is evident that a general proposition 
is assumed tacitly or openly and from this the 
conclusion is drawn 

now this is the case in every instance of in 
ductive reasoning some general principle is 
always taken for granted and with this the par 
ticular facts are compared before the conclusion 
is drawn the general principle assumed is com 
monly that nature is uniform in her operations 
or where human testimony is relied on that men 
will tell the truth where they have no interest to 
the contrary thus in examining the evidences of 
christianity we are careful to observe whether 
the first witnesses could have had any motive to 
spread a false story and when we have deter 
mined that they had none we infer from the 
above general principle that they actually spoke 
the truth unless that general principle be 
sound there is no reason why they should have 
given a true rather than a false account just as 
there is no reason why we should believe one 
quadruped to be organized inwardly like another 
quadruped unless nature be in general uniform 
in her works and operations 

if the above statement be correct it follows that 
induction when taken to comprise not only the ex 
amination of facts but also an inference from them 
always embraces a deductive process of reasoning 

c c 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

wherein then it may be asked consists the 
diflference between induction and deduction pro 
per the difference is 

firstj that the facts from which induction 
springs are never more genera than the con 
clusion 

secondly that the conclusion always seems to 
follow at once from the facts for 

thirdly the general propositions being always 
the same and universally acknowledged are 
never stated and 

fourthly there is no such thing as a long 
chain of inductive reasoning as there may be of 
deduction proper where one inference may 
follow upon another till we get far away from 
the original premises whereas on the other 
hand 

fifthly in induction the detail of facts may 
fill volumes there is in short in induction far 
less reasoning than in deduction proper the 
process consisting in the former of one step 
only 

lastly since particulars occur first to the 
mind it follows that the inductive must precede 

p take as an instance of the one malthus on population who 
fills three volumes with facts in support of his principle of the 
other the writings of ricardo and james mill on political 
economy 



reasoning 

the deductive process the general notions and 
general propositions from which the latter sets 
out must have been established by a previous 
process of inductive generalization well or ill 
performed thus in the order of time induction 
comes before deduction 

by many bacon has been called the inventor 
of the inductive method a method however as 
old as the creation which that eminent genius 
only brought more into notice restored im 
proved and illustrated 

the general principle which runs through 
deductive reasoning and of which every such 
argument is only a particular application is that 
what is allowed to be true in general will be true 
in a particular case thus suppose it granted 
that trade ought to be free we may infer that the 
com trade ought to be free but some one may 
object that here there is a reason for an ex 
ception that the rule is not applicable to this 
case hereupon issue is joined and the dis 
cussion turns upon the point not whether trade 
in general ought to be free for that is granted 
but whether there be any circumstances peculiar 
to the com trade which take it out of the 
general rule and according to the solution of 
this question the above inference will or will 
not hold good 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

now as we have seen that every case of in 
duction comprises a process of deductive reason 
ing it follows that the general principle just 
mentioned must he common to both deduction 
and induction but besides this common prin 
ciple every purely deductive argument has its 
own less general principle such as in the above 
instance trade ought to be free from which a 
special conclusion is drawn 

in induction on the other hand each argu 
ment has not a principle peculiar to itself it has 
only one or other of two or three very general 
principles common to all cases of induction 
such as nature is uniform in her works and 
operations thus we rise from the particular to 
the general by a process which comparing the 
expressed premises with the conclusion is the 
reverse of the deductive though as we have 
seen the inference from the particular facts to 
the general law cannot be logically drawn with 
out the intervention of a much more general 
but universally acknowledged principle 

the object of general induction is to establish 
a general conclusion by means of instances so 
divested of peculiar circumstances as to obviate 
the mistake of stating as general what is only 
particular one instance would be as good as a 
thousand if we could be sure that it was quite 



reasoning 

in pointy that is free from any peculiar circum 
stances and it is only because we are not sure of 
this that we must multiply instances the grand 
point then is to prove similarity perfect or at 
least sufficient similarity between cases observed 
and others not observed the uncertainty of 
induction depends partly on the difficulty of 
determining the degree of similarity between 
cases observed and others which have not been 
observed in all points partly on the mistakes to 
which the original observation was liable in a 
word we may observe ill in the first instance or 
the new cases may not be in all respects similar 
to the old 

there is a strong tendency in the human mind 
to draw a general conclusion even from a single 
instance thus when a child first sees a pool of 
water he can form no idea of the effects of water 
on man but let him once see a person drowned 
and he will ever afterwards act on the belief that 
water will drown those who get over head and 
ears here the child reasons inductively and 
from a single instance and yet in this case cor 
rectly this and innumerable similar cases 
show us the natural tendency which is to leap at 
once to a general conclusion even from one fact 
observed a tendency which a wider experience 
alone can check and which in many if not in 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

all is checked but imperfectly during the whole 
course of their lives 

we have seen that the validity of inductive 
reasoning rests fundamentally upon the tacit 
assumption that nature is uniform in her opera 
tions that things which have coexisted will be 
found again to coexist and that those which have 
succeeded each other will continue to succeed in 
the same order now this assumption is not 
selfevident neither does it admit of proof but 
we implicitly believe and cannot help believing 
it to be true it is then one of the first princi 
ples of human knowledge though not a necessary 
or selfevident proposition that the sun which 
has risen every day of our lives will again rise 
tomorrow that when it shines it will give sen 
sible heat that a stone thrown up into the air 
will speedily fall back to the earth we cannot 
doubt though the only ground for this belief is 
that such has always been the case in time past 
between the assertion this has always been and 
the inference this will always be there is a wide 
gulf which we must leap across for we never can 
bridge it over the inference is not logical for 
we can see no connection between the premises 
and the conclusion but it is irresistible this 
then is a primary article of belief totally inde 
pendent of reasoning neither selfevident nor 



reasonino 

known by experience for experience is only of 
the past all inferences from experience how 
ever take it for granted and on this assumption 
alone are they logically drawn 

as the subject of induction has lately given 
rise to a controversy between two eminent 
philosophers i shall conclude what i have to say 
under this head by a reference thereto and by 
examining the points in dispute i may perhaps 
be able to throw some additional light upon this 
fundamental question the points in dispute 
between dr whewell and mr mill so far as the 
nature of induction is concerned seem to be the 
following 

 whether the term induction may with 
propriety be applied to the case where particular 
facts are brought in to establish not a general 
but a particular conclusion 

 whether general facts of every day no 
toriety learnt without effort and commonly 
called practical knowledge such as the freezing of 
water by cold and its evaporation by heat the 
fact that water will suffocate and fire consume 
and the like be known by a process similar to 
that whereby truths less familiar commonly called 
scientific are established 

 see dr whewells little work of induction and mr 
miirs system of logic 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

 whether the skill which is gained hy 
practice without formal study skill in playing 
cricket tennis billiards co skill in shooting 
with the gun or the bow c when not derived 
from scientific principles of which the mind is 
conscious be or be not acquired by a process 
similar to induction so similar as to warrant us 
in applying to it the same name 

now in order to solve these questions we must 
call to mind what was stated at the opening of 
this inquiry into reasoning viz that god has given 
to men but two means for the acquisition of know 
ledge and the discovery of truth — observation 
including experiments and reasoning there 
fore all knowledge must be acquired either by 
observation alone or by reasoning alone or by 
the two combined 

particular facts cognizable by the senses are 
known simply by observation as the geographi 
cal features of any country the form of the 
coast the course of the rivers the position of 
the mountains that cambridgeshire is a flat 
country wales mountainous and westmoreland 
abounding in lakes are facts known by observa 
tion alone at least in the first instance here 
no reasoning is required on the contrary the 
truths of pure mathematics are known by rea 
soning alone for except the definitions axioms 



reasoning 

and postulates the first of which are of course 
propositions merely explaining the meaning of 
words the second truths selfevident the third 
selfevident possibilities the whole process is 
reasoning 

all other truths whether general or particular 
are acquired by observation together with reason 
ing either by the close union of the two or by 
reasoning based indeed upon observation follow 
ing it for a season but afterwards emancipated 
from it to the former of these we conceive 
that the term induction properly belongs at 
least as the process is similar whenever obser 
vation and reasoning closely unite there the 
same name should be applied whether induction 
or any other 

in the case of induction upon which pro 
bable deduction is always founded the reasoning 
is based not on necessary or selfevident truths 
but on what may be called primary universal 
articles of belief articles neither selfevident nor 
capable of proof which nevertheless we hold 
with unshaken constancy such as belief in the 
existence of the material world belief in the 
uniformity of nature c starting from these 
fundamental articles and taking observation as 
our guide we arrive at the knowledge of general 
truths not cognizable by the senses by a process 

d d 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

combining reasoning with observation to whieh 
the name induction is always applied now the 
question is whether by a process exactly similar 
we may not obtain the knowledge of particular 
facts also not cognizable by the senses of the 
inquirer 

let the particular fact to be established be the 
genuineness of the gospel according to st john 
this is a fact certainly not cognizable by the 
senses of any one now alire and which cannot 
therefore be known by observation alone neither 
can it be known by reasoning alone therefore 
if it can be established it must be by observation 
and reasoning together the particular kind of 
evidence to which we here have recourse is that 
of testimony the testimony of many ancient 
authors who cite that gospel as the undoubted 
production of st john here we have a number 
of particular facts brought forward to establish 
another particular fact the principle being always 
assumed though tacitly that generally speaking 
human testimony is worthy of credit thus we 
arrive at the conclusion that the gospel attributed 
to st john was really written by him now 
in what does this differ from any case of induc 
tion where the conclusion is general simply in 
that not in the process whereby the conclusion 
is established we select a great number of 



reasoning 

particular facts in this case particular testi 
monies all tending to the same conclusion we 
then assume tacitly indeed the general principle 
founded on observation that men will speak 
truth when they have no decided motive to the 
contrary and lastly we infer that the gospel of 
t john is a genuine work 

the whole process consists first in the 
selection and bringing forward of particular 
facts secondly in the assumption of a general 
principle universally acknowledgedi and there 
fore seldom openly stated lastly in drawing the 
inference from these premises we may if we 
please establish a specific difference and call this 
a case of particular induction but we cannot 
allow that there is a generic distinction between 
it and general induction 

in paleys evidences of the truth of christi 
anity we find distinct specimens of both induc 
tive and deductive inquiry in chapter i the 
author produces evidences of the sufiierings of 
the first propagators of christianity from the 
nature of the case that is he endeavours to 
show from the known principles of human nature 
that persons situated as were undoubtedly the 
first propagators of christianity were likely to 
endure much persecution here he proceeds 
deductively he afterwards brings forward the 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

testimony of both heathen and christian writers 
in proof of the same and here he adopts 
the inductive method as also in the great 
chapter ix divided into eleven sections wherein 
he enumerates so many direct testimonies in 
favour of the genuineness of the books of the 
new testament these we conceive are speci 
mens of particular induction for the facts estab 
lished are of that order 

to take another and familar instance sup 
pose a man previously in good health to change 
his residence not long after he feels indisposed 
and he begins to think that the air of his new 
abode is unwholesome this is a mere suspicion 
for many other causes may have injured his 
health however he leaves his new house and 
soon after his usual good health returns his 
suspicion is now strengthened but he is not yet 
certain he returns and again falls ill now he 
has but little doubt again he leaves and again 
he recovers at last he is convinced if the ex 
periment were tried upon other persons and 
always with like results one must be almost as 
sure of the unhealthiness of the spot as of a 
proposition in geometry the conclusion in this 
case is particular and if it have not been arrived 
at by induction i should like to know what name 
must be given to the process 



reasoning 

the second question is whether general facts 
of every day notoriety learnt without eflfort such 
as the freezing of water by cold and its evapora 
tion by heat the fact that water will suffocate 
and fire consume and other such be known by 
a process similar to that whereby facts less 
familiar commonly called scientific are estab 
lished dr whewell seems to think that the 
term induction should be applied only to the 
process whereby scientific facts are discovered 
but we must remember that there is no accurate 
distinction between scientific and other general 
facts no difference except in the degree in which 
they happen to be familiar thus what is con 
sidered a vulgar ordinary fact in one country or 
in one age may be science in another place or at 
another time the freezing of water at a certain 
temperature is a common occurrence in england 
but to a native of the coast of guinea it may be 
a scientific fact but will it be said that the 
knowledge of a familiar fact is obtained in a 
different manner from a nonfamiliar one the 
only difference as i conceive is in the degree of 
eflfort and in the degree of attention required in 
the two cases the one we cannot help knowing 
if we have our eyes open and enjoy a common 
share of intellectual faculties the other may 
require long and painful investigation 



 introduction to mental philobopht 

still the nature of the process may be essen 
tially the same the degree of attention and of 
effort are variable accidents not essentials and in 
no two cases may they quite agree but what we 
conceive to be alike in all these cases is that we 
begin by observation whether with a previous in 
tention or not and from this observation combined 
with a general article of belief either original or 
derived we draw a conclusion less general which 
we afterwards apply in particular instances 

thus to recur to an example formerly given 
there can be little doubt that were a child of a 
certain age with his faculties well developed to 
see a man drowned he would avoid deep water 
ever afterwards but why should he avoid it 
surely because he thinks that it would drown 
him too and why does he think so because 
he has seen a man drowned but that alone is 
no reason he must conclude from that particu 
lar event that water will drown all men and 
therefore himself before he can be said to believe 
or act rationally and how can he draw such a 
conclusion but by means of an original principle 
of belief that what has been will be or that 
nature is uniform in her operations and here 
we have an exact specimen of the inductive pro 
cess observe well that this is not instinct for 
instinct acts prior to experience and uniformly 



reasoning 

as bees who all over the world build their cells 
in the form of hexagons and as some animals 
who avoid poisonous plants without trng them 
but the child before experience does not know 
that water will suffocate or fire give pain for 
children who have learnt no better will put their 
fingers into the candle 

neither can we allow with dr whewell that 
the mere badness or insufficiency of the investi 
gation or that the falsity of the conclusion is a 
sufficient reason for denying that the process is 
inductive we constantly say that a man rea 
sons ill that his conclusions are erroneous but 
we do not for that contend that he does not 
reason at all so a man may content himself 
with a very wretched induction and yet he may 
use it after a fashion of his own even the 
kentish clown who said that tenterden church 
steeple was the cause of the goodwin sands 
because it was built just before the sea rose and 
swallowed up the land may be said to have 
reasoned inductively if we adopt the maxim 
post hocy ergo propter hoc we may prove any ab 
surdity 

i am glad to find that the opinion here 
stated is held by a distinguished metaphysician 
dr reid — the last kind of probable evidence i 
shall mention is that by which the known laws 



 intboducnon to mbntai fhiloeofht 

of nature have been discovered and the effects 
which have been produced by them in former 
ages or which may be expected in time to come 
the knowledge of some of the laws of nature is 
necessary to all men in the conduct of life 
these are soon discovered even by savages 
they know that fire bums that water drowns 
that bodies gravitate towards the earth they 
know that day and night summer and winter 
regularly succeed each other as far back as 
their experience and observation reach they 
know that these have happened regularly and 
upon this ground they are led by the constitu 
tion of human nature to expect that they will 
happen in time to come in like circumstances 

the knowledge which the philosopher attains 
of the laws of nature differs from that of the 
vulgar not in the first principles on which it is 
grounded but in its extent and accuracy he 
collects with care the phenomena that lead to the 
same conclusion and compares them with those 
that seem to contradict or to limit it and what 
conclusions does the philosopher draw from the 
facts he has collected they are that like events 
have happened in former times in like circum 
stances and will happen in time to come and 
these conclusions are built on the very same 



reasoning 

ground on which the simple rustic concludes that 
the sun will rise tomorrow 

but the dignity of science is thought to be 
lowered by applying a scientific term to a process 
in use among the vulgar and hence we may 
suppose the unwillingness of some peculiarly 
distinguished in the paths of science to allow 
that common knowledge is really acquired by 
induction 

the third question is whether the skill which 
is gained by practice without formal study skill 
in playing cricket tennis billiards c skill in 
shooting with the gun or the bow c when not 
derived from scientific principles of which the 
mind is conscious and which it can state in 
words be or be not acquired by a process simi 
lar to induction so similar as to warrant us in 
applying to it the same name 

it is supposed then that the skill is acquired 
not instinctive and therefore so far it agrees 
with knowledge the result of induction and 
how is it acquired by practice as the phrase 
is that is by experience not by simple observa 
tion but by numerous intentional trials or 
experiments so far again it agrees with induc 
tive speculative knowledge and the performer 
is supposed to improve by experience but how

can he improve unless he have paid attention to 
the circumstances attending his successes and 
his failures and have thence drawn some general 
conclusions some rules applicable to future 
occasions what though these rules be not 
formally stated in propositions what thoih 
they cannot be imparted to others they may 
notwithstanding exist in his mind in a shape 
sufficiently definite to act upon and indeed we 
may be sure that they do so exist otherwise no 
practice would make him better 

very similar is the case of what is commonly 
called practical knowledge in a learned profession 
as in that of the physician all the study in 
the world will never make a good physician 
without experience of the treatment of diseases 
and some gain more from the same experience 
than others the same outward facts are before 
all but some learn much from them others little 
that is to say they make more or fewer better or 
worse inductions much of this knowledge is 
incommunicable and so dies with the individual 
because it is not sufficiently definite subject to 
too many exceptions to be formally stated in 
propositions so it is with games of skill such 
as cricket or tennis some rules of good play 
may certainly be stated in words but others 
cannot for the reason just given but because 



hsafioning 

they cannot be enunciated we must not con 
elude that they exist not mentally and that 
they do exist the best proof is that progress is 
made 

how can progress be made in any thing spe 
culative or practical without an operation of 
mind to move our limbs requires a previous 
mental change and though muscular strength 
must exist it is the mind that directs to sup 
pose that the mere muscular fibre can prefer one 
action to another is as contradictory as to aj£rm 
that body is mind that matter is spirit skill in 
bodily motion then always supposes a previous 
mental training but there can be no mental 
training without rules and no rules without 
induction 

on each of the three questions above stated 
i am thus led to a conclusion the reverse of that 
at which dr wheweu has arrived on other 
points however i am glad to find that i agree 
with that eminent philosopher it is debated 
between him and mr mill whether keplers 
discovery of the law that the planets move round 
the sun in ellipses be or be not an instance of 
induction that it i i completely agree with 
dr whewell why is the contrary maintained by 
mr mill because says he it is a fact surely 
that the planet does describe an ellipse and a 



 introduction to mental philpht 

fact which we could see if we had adequate 
visual organs and a suitable position 

the whole pith of this objection lies in the 
conjunction if 

it is quite true that if we had such organs 
and such a position we should have no need of 
induction to establish the fact in question we 
should require our senses only and the faculty 
of perception we require no induction to 
prove that the pantheon at rome is round and 
the colosseum oval but these we can take in 
with a glance and it is exactly because we can 
not so embrace the orbits of the planets that 
induction is necessary to establish the fact of 
their ellipticity what kepler really saw was a 
planet in many different positions and nothing 
more he could not see it moving still less could 
he see its whole course at once how then 
could he possibly describe its orbit as mr mill 
supposes for we describe only what we see 
from many different positions then which he 
actually saw he inferred innumerable other posi 
tions which he did not see all which together 
made up this figure of an ellipse i cannot 
conceive a fairer specimen of induction though 
in this case no law of causation was established 
but the discovery of causes though the highest 

• system of logic ratiocinative and inductive vol i p p 



reasoning 

end of induction is not essential to the process 

can it be that mr mill will allow this to be 
only a description because the elliptical form of 
the orbit is a act but as i have shown under 
the article hypothesis and theory and as 
dr whewell also maintains a fact differs from a 
theory only in the degree of evidence on which 
it rests a theory well established and generally 
received becomes a fact this is a truth without 
the knowledge of which there can as i conceive 
be no correct estimate of the object of science 
and philosophy 

i also entirely agree with dr whewell that a 
conception is an essential part of induction 
indeed i am at a loss to imagine how the con 
trary can be maintained by any metaphysician 
if we do not conceive a general fact before enun 
ciating it in words we must then i suppose 
perceive it we may certainly perceive particular 
facts such as the fall of a stone to the earth but 
how can we perceive that all bodies within a cer 
tain distance would fall to the earth or that all 
bodies in nature tend to each other these are 
general facts far removed from our senses and 
therefore from our perceptions which are closely 
connected with our sensations a simple tendency 
cannot be seen even in a particular instance still 
less a general tendency but the mitid conceives 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

it otherwise how could we know it if it be 
allowed that we know anything and yet we do 
not perceive it i should like to know what word 
we ought to employ better than conception to 
express that knowledge 

unless we revive the exploded and unphilo 
sophical notion of condillac that all our mental 
states are only transformed sensations unless we 
allow with destutt de tracy that penser cest 
sentir et rien que sentir we cannot get rid of 
conceptions in cases where we know suppose 
conjecture or imagine but do not perceive 

it is allowed that kepler did not see did not 
perceive the elliptical orbit of the planets or of 
any one planet yet he affirmed with more or 
less certainty that the orbit was such but how 
could he affirm that of which he had no notion 
or conception the supposition is a palpable 
contradiction 

i likewise think with dr whewell that mr 
mill has made a great mistake in supposing that 
the future progress of science will depend more 
upon deduction than induction nothing appears 
to me more unlikely if we compare the slow 
progress of physical science before the triumph 
of the inductive method under bacon with its 
rapid progress since we shall be convinced that 
its future advancement must still depend upon 



reasoning 

the same method every year almost every 
month some new discovery is announced as thus 
obtained and who shall say when these dis 
coveries shall be exhausted if we consider that 
it is little more than two hundred years since 
men began seriously and patiently to investigate 
nature we shall rather conclude that inductive 
science is as yet in its infancy in the history 
of the human race two hundred years is but a 
point 

to many of the physical sciences deduction 
is applicable in a very limited degree and no 
reason at present appears why it should ever be 
much more applicable it enters little into the 
sciences of chemistry physiology geology 
or meteorology still less into the purely 
descriptive sciences of zoology botany and 
mineralogy 

before the triumph of the baconian philoso 
phy physicians attempted to account for all the 
phenomena of life from a few principles of 
chemistry or of mechanics with what success 
all are now agreed 

it is chiefly in the mental sciences and in 
mechanical philosophy which treats of sensible 
motions that deduction plays an important part 
in morals and politics innumerable volumes 
have been filled in deducing conclusions from a 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

few general principles the whole philosophy of 
bentham is a deduction from his one principle of 
selfinterest 

so it is likewise in mechanical philosophy 
where from a few general facts established by 
experience such as the laws of motion we are 
able to deduce innumerable conclusions by rea 
soning strictly demonstrative the sensible 
motions of inanimate matter and the actions of 
rational voluntary agents seem then to a£ford the 
greatest scope for deductive inquiry insensible 
motions on the other hand such as those of 
chemistry and even the sensible motions of liv 
ing bodies cannot be traced far in this way 

it would however be a fatal mistake to sup 
pose that little or nothing remains to be done in 
the mental sciences by means of induction 
pure mental philosophy or metaphysics is more 
of an inductive than of a deductive science it 
is by observing the operations of our own minds 
that we come to know them and it is exactly 
because that observation was so neglected that 
metaphysics made so little progress and who 
shall pretend to say that all the social and 
political lessons of history are exhausted that no 

 for an example of the application of the inductive method to 
mental philosophy see the authors analysis and theory of the 
emotions 



reasoning 

new principles remain to be discovered that we 
have only to apply the old it is not many years 
since malthus established the principle of popu 
lation by a very copious induction it seems to 
me the more remarkable that mr mill should 
have undervalued the probable efficacy of induc 
tion in the future progress of science seeing that 
so large a part of his own great work is devoted 
to the subject i cannot but consider this as the 
most important part of his system of logic 
his attempt to reduce induction to a scientific 
form appears to me worthy of all commendation 
dr wheweil i am aware thinks otherwise and he 
is fortified by the opinion of sir john herschel 
as well as by another eminent author who look 
upon the corresponding efforts of bacon the 
prerogatives of instances contained in the 
second book of the novum organum as more 
curious than useful but the objections made to 
such attempts are nothing new they are the 
same as have been started against logic in gene 
ral as well as against scientific systems of morals 
viz that men use induction naturally reason 
naturally praise and blame naturally and there 
fore there is no occasion for science in these 
matters we grant the premises but deny the 
conclusion men it is true use induction natur 
ally but often imperfectly they reason naturally 

f f 



 intrqduction to lifental philosophy 

but often inconclusively they praise and blame 
naturally but not always justly hence the 
utility of general rules applicable to induction 
to reasoning in general and to moral senti 
ment 

i shall conclude this head with one of the 
aphorisms of bacon wherein the two methods 
the deductive and the inductive are well des 
cribed 

 there are and can be but two ways of 
seeking and finding out truth the one from 
sense and particulars flies to the most general 
axioms and from these principles firmly esta 
blished finds out and judges of intermediate 
axioms and this is the way now in use the 
other raises axioms from sense and particulars 

 the argument in favour of the application of science to 
reasoning as well as to morals may be seen for the one in the 
introduction to whatelys elements of logic for the other in 
the introduction to my on principles of human happiness and 
human duty with respect to the utility of the rules of the 
novum organum in particular the opinion of dr reid differs 
widely from that of dr whewell and sir john herschel 
among those philosophers who have most closely pursued the 
path pointed out in that great work he mentions sir isaac newton 
as holding the first rank having in the third book of the 
principia and in his optics had the rules of the novum 
organum constantly in his eye brief account of aristotles 
logic chap vi sect 



reasoning 

ascending continuously and gradually so as at 
last to arrive at the most general which is the 
true but untried way 

though these two modes of inquiry induq 
tion and deduction embrace a very large part 
of probable reasoning yet there seem to be 
some reasonings which cannot properly be 
classed under either as instances take the 
following 

a is the cause of b but b is the cause of c 

therefore a is the remote cause of c 

application depends upon the will but in 
tellectual advancement depends much upon 
application 

therefore intellectual advancement depends 
much upon the will 

romulus founded rome but rome con 
quered great part of the known world and rose 
to an unexampled pitch of power and grandeur 

therefore romulus was the original cause of 
the power and grandeur of rome 

in these and similar reasonings we neither 
rise from particulars to generals nor descend 
from generals to particulars but we remain as 
it were on a plain as in pure mathematics and 
from two previous propositions likewise as in 
pure mathematics we infer a third whereas in 

 novum organum aph xix 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

deductive reasoning though there may he three 
propositions when the argument is stated in full 
yet one is very often suppressed in inductive 
reasoning always this then i shall heg leave 
to call plain reasoning thus we find that pro 
bable reasoning embraces at least three kinds 
the inductive the deductive and the plain and 
the last seems to approach nearer to the nature 
of demonstration than either of the others in 
it no general principle is tacitly assumed and 
reasoned from but all is openly stated and 
though the last proposition follows from the two 
former it is not comprehended under either 
of them 

plain reasoning then differs much more from 
the deductive and the inductive than these two 
from each other therefore they ought not to 
be classed on the same line indeed we have 
seen that though the whole process of induc 
tion differs widely from deduction yet the 
reasoning strictly so called contained in both is 
very similar consequently we ought to class 
inductive and deductive reasoning together as 
species of a common genus opposed to which 
will be plain reasoning 

iv after these remarks on the nature of 
reasoning in general as well as its different kinds 
we shall be better able to answer that oft 



reasoning 

debated question what are we to think of the 
syllogism in the whole history of philosophy 
there is not a more singular fact than this that 
the syllogism is still a matter of dispute 

since the days of bacon howerer the empire 
of aristotle has gradually been going to decay 
and faith in the allsufficiency of the syllogism 
has more and more been shaken bacon him 
self in his novum orffannm frequently decries 
the syllogism pascal depreciates it and locke 
with some succeeding philosophers particularly 
thomas brown scoffs at it altogether but in 
our days an attempt has been made to restore 
the logic as well as the religion of the middle 
ages and the same university which nursed a 
newman has produced a whately the latter 

 see novum organum in diatrihutione operis and aph 
xi xii xiii xiv and ixiii where axistotle is blamed for corrupting 
physics by his dialectics see also de augmentis scientu 
arum lib v cap ii 

 see pascal de tesprit geometrique and de part de 
persuader contained in the last and best edition of the penses 
de pascal by prosper faugre paris 

 it is worthy of remark that whately in the preface to his 
 elements of logic acknowledges that the rev j newman 
 actually composed a considerable portion of the work as it now 
stands from manuscripts not designed for publication and that 
he is the original author of several pages 



 introduction to mental philphy 

has written a work chiefly to prove that the 
logic of aristotle is the only logic and syllo 
gism the only reasoning that in fact the 
syllogism is not a particular kind of reasoning 
hut the form to which all sound reasoning may 
he reduced hy whatever name it be called 
thus according to the archbishop and phi 
losopher there are no different sorts of reasoning 
but all are alike whether certain or probable a 
priori or a posteriori demonstrative inductive 
or deductive all are exactly similar that the 
reasgning strictly so called contained in induc 
tion is akin to deduction i am willing to allow 
and indeed have endeavoured to show but that 
mathematical or demonstrative reasoning differs 
not specifically from either i can by no means 
admit this dr whately assumes without any 
attempt at proof what i have called plain 
probable reasoning seems to me also to differ 
materially from the deductive as well as from 
the inductive 

no doubt there must be something common 
to all reasoning or the same name reasoning 
would not have been given to the process in all 
cases but had there been no differences neither 
would there have been any specific names such 
as probable demonstrative inductive c what is 



reasoning 

commou to all reasoning what it is which makes 
reasoning a gentis we have seen in the opening of 
this article and that account we must hear in 
mind during the following discussion wherein 
consist the differences which mark out several 
species of reasoning we have also seen and if 
these differences be real especially the grand 
difference between demonstration and proba 
bility then it follows contrary to the opinion of 
whately that all reasoning is not specifically 
the same consequently unless the word syllo 
gism mean nothing more than a sound argument 
in general stated in full unless it be merely a 
generic word then all sound reasoning stated 
explicitly cannot be syllogistical 

but in order to know what the word syllogism 
really does mean we must refer to the definitions 
which have been given of it the examples 
brought forward in illustration and the general 
principle said to pervade all syllogisms when 
we know what a syllogism really is then and not 
till then can we determine whether it include all 
reasoning or any 

let us first take aristotles own definition of 
the syllogism which is as follows — a syllogism 
is a speech in which certain propositions being 
stated and granted some other proposition dif 
ferent from these follows of necessity and this 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

solely in virtue of the propositions stated 
and this definition is thus explained by alex 
ander one of aristotles commentators but 
when aristotle says follows of necessity this does 
not mean that the conclusion as a proposition in 
itself should necessarily be true for this is the 
case only in syllogisms of necessary matter but 
that the conclusion be its matter what it may actual 
contingent or necessary must follow of necessity 
from the premises 

reids definition of syllogism as completed by 
sir william hamilton varies a little from the 
foregoing but is perfectly consistent with it 
a syllogism says he is an argument or 
reasoning consisting always explicably or im 
plicibly of three propositions the last of which 
called the conclusion is necessarily inferred 
from the very statement of the two preceding 
which are called the premises 

according to the above definitions all pure 
mathematical or demonstrative reasoning is syllo 
gistical for here assuredly each argument con 

 prior aualytics book i chap i 

 see sir william hamiltons editioa of reids works a 
brief accoimt of aristotles logic — chap iv sect note 

 the words in brackets have been supplied by sir william 
hamilton in his edition of reids works 



reasoning 

sists of three propositions and the conclusion fol 
lows irresistibly or of necessity from the premises 




in the triangle abc let the side a b be 
equal to b c and ac to b c then the side 
a b will be equal to the side a c here there 
are three propositions the two former being 
called the premises from which the conclusion 
follows irresistibly and as this is a specimen 
of all pure mathematical reasoning therefore 
according to the above definition all such rea 
soning is syllogistical 

but in all other reasonings generally con 
sidered sound and valid does the conclusion 
follow of necessity from the conclusion 

take the following as a specimen — 
trade in general ought to be free 

therefore the corn trade ought to be free 

is this reasoning or is it not is it good rea 
soning most people i conceive would allow 
that the reasoning is fair though not infallible 
from the assumption that trade ought to be free 
we are entitled to infer probably indeed not 
necessarily that the com trade ought to be free 
probably only because though trade in general 
ought to be free there may still be circumstances 

g g 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

peouliar to the corn trade which take it out of 
the general rule therefore here we have a 
specimen of what all would allow to he reason 
ing where the conclusion does not follow of 
necessity from the premises and which there 
fore does not agree with the definition of the 
syllogism consequently all reasoning is not 
syllogistical in the sense above given 

moreover can we say that the argument 
consists implicitly of three propositions if 
there be three then explicitly they are as 
follows — 
 trade in general ought to be free 

the corn trade is a trade 

therefore the corn trade ought to be free 

does not every one see that the second pro 
position is a mere truism or identical statement 
where nothing is told which is not impued in 
the meaning of the subject of the proposition 
it cannot therefore be an essential part of the 
argument and if not then we have a valid 
piece of reasoning consisting only of two pro 
positions here again then we miss one of the 
characteristics of the syllogism but the above 
is only a specimen of ten thousand arguments of 
the same kind and therefore we must conclude 
that all reasoning cannot be stated in syllogisms 
as above defined 



reasoning 

let us now take another method of arriving 
at the nature of the syllogism and instead of a 
definition let us examine what is allowed hy 
dialecticians to be the fundamental principle of 
all syllogisms the famous dictum of aristotle 
which is that whatever is affirmed or denied uni 
versally of any class of things may he affirmed or 
denied of anything comprehended in that class 
this according to archbishop whately is the 
universal principle of reasoning for as he 
thinks all reasoning is syllogistical now cail 
this principle be applied to all reasoning in the 
first place be it remarked that this celebrated 
dictum is in reality no principle or axiom at all 
for it affirms nothing which is not already com 
prehended in the meaning of the word class it 
is in fact a definition of a class and so a 
merely verbal proposition how a mere defini 
tion can be the universal principle of reasoning 
passes all conception 

but waving this objection which meets us at 
the very outset of the inquiry and allowing the 

 let it not be supposed that i assert that aristotle thought 
that he had discovered in this dictum the universal principle of 
reasoning my remarks apply to one of the most distinguished 
of his modern disciples and we all know that disciples often go 
beyond their masters aristotle said only that the above dictum 
was the universal principle of syllogisms 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

above to be entitled to the name of a principle 
let us see whether it be applicable to all or any 
kind of reasoning when we refer to the various 
sorts of relation about which reasoning is con 
versant that are mentioned above we see but 
one kind at most to which the principle of the 
syllogism can be applicable namely relations of 
comprehension this no doubt is a very im 
portant class but it is only one class and 
certainly not more important than relations of 
cause and effect if a be the cause of b and 
b of c then a is the remote cause of c this is 
surely reasoning and correct reasoning but how 
the conclusion is here comprehended under either 
of the premises i am quite at a loss to perceive 
so likewise in the reasoning 
application depends upon the will 
but intellectual advancement depends much 
upon application 

therefore intellectual advancement depends 
much upon the will 

here it will be allowed that the conclusion fol 
lows fairly from the premises but surely it is not 
comprehended under either of them according 
to the syllogistic theory application is here the 
middle term and this is a class under which the 
subject of the conclusion namely intellectual 
advancement must be brought in order that 



reasoning 

what had previously been asserted of the former 
may be asserted also of the latter but how 
intellectual advancement is a particular instance 
or a species of the genus application i am at a 
loss to see by the supposition the one appli 
cation precedes as cause and the other in 
tellectual advancement follows as effect and 
therefore the latter cannot be an instance of 
the former 

again taking relations of quantity 




in the triangle abc if the side a b is equal 
to b c and a c to b c then is the side a b 
equal to a c this it will be allowed is demon 
strative reasoning but here also the principle of 
the syllogism is quite inapplicable the con 
clusion certainly follows irresistibly from the 
premises but it is not comprehended under 
either of the previous propositions 

it appears then from the acknowledged 
general principle of the syllogism and from 
the particular instances of demonstrative reason 
ing and probable plain reasoning now given 
that to neither of these species of reasoning is 
the syllogism applicable but we found before 
that it follows directly from the definition of the 
syllogism that all probable reasoning cannot be 



 introduction to mental philphy 

stated in syuogisms therefore whether we 
start from the definition or from the acknow 
ledged general principle of the syllogism we 
arrive at the same conclusion mark however 
this difference that whereas according to the 
definition demonstrative or pure mathematical 
reasoning is certainly syllogistical according to 
the general principle above stated it certainly is 
not syllogistical therefore the definition and the 
general principle are inconsistent but whether 
we adopt the one or the other it equally 
follows that all reasoning cannot be expressed in 
syllogisms 

the question is now reduced to much nar 
rower limits having seen that the syllogism is 
not the form in which all correct reasoning can 
be stated it only remains to inquire whether any 
legitimate reasoning can be so expressed 

if we take the definitions above given of the 
syllogism that question is already answered for 
we found that demonstrative or mathematical 
reasoning agrees perfectly with those definitions 
but as they are in accordance neither with the 
socalled general principle of the syllogism nor 
yet with the examples thereof generally brought 
forward we shall adopt these in order to deter 
mine whether any reasoning be really syllogistical 

agreeably to that fundamental principle as 



reasoning 

given above it would appear that to relations of 
comprehension if to any the syllogism must 
apply for the principle is that what is true of a 
class is true of all individuals comprehended un 
der that class to deductive reasoning then as 
tracing relations of comprehension the syllosm 
may be applicable 

observe that in reference to reasoning there 
are two questions to be solved the one purely 
metaphysical and speculative the other logical 
and practical the first what is really the pro 
cess which goes on in our minds in reasoning 
the second how are we to test the validity of an 
aiument each of these questions must be 
treated separately 

this distinction may be illustrated by refer 
ence to ethics in which also there are two grand 
questions the one what are th causes present 
to the mind which actually regulate our moral 
sentiments the other what are the circum 
stances which justify us on mature reflection for 
awarding approbation or disapprobation to any 
action the former question relates to the 
origin of our moral sentiments the latter to the 
criterion of morality 

the first question is whether the syllogism be 
a full statement founded on a correct analysis 
of the mental process in deductive reaaomng 



¦¦m 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

having already mentioned the general principle 
of the syllogism let us now bring forward some 
examples 

 whatever exhibits marks of design had an 

intelligent author 
the world exhibits marks of design 
therefore the world had an intelligent author 

 all tyrants deserve death 
csesar was a tyrant 
therefore caesar deserved death 

 every dispensation of providence is beneficial 
afflictions are dispensations of providence 
therefore they are beneficial 

 every creature possessed of reason and liberty 

ought to practice justice 
man is a creature possessed of reason and 
liberty 

therefore he ought to practise justice 

 no vicious man is worthy of esteem and 

reward 
john is a vicious man 

therefore john is not worthy of esteem and 
reward 

 no tyrannical government is good 
the turkish government is tyrannical 
therefore it is not good 

these are instances of regular syllogisms in 
the first figure to which we are told by aristotle 



reasoning 

and his fouowers all legitimate syllogisms may 
be reduced here the middle term is the sub 
ject of the major and the predicate of the minor 
proposition we shall also give a specimen of 
the second and of the third figure 

 whatever is bad is not the work of god 

all the natural passions and appetites of men 
are the work of god 

therefore they are not bad 

in this instance the middle term is the 
predicate both of the major and of the minor 
proposition or the syllogism is of the second 
figure 

the next is from reid 

 all africans are black 
all africans are men 
therefore some men are black 

here the middle term is the subject both of 
the major and minor or the syllogism is of 
the third figure 

these instances may suffice to show us the 
nature of syllogisms in all the conclusion is 

 the firet three are taken from whatelys logic the first 
in particular is his favourite specimen in the prior analytics 
book i chap vii aristotle proves that all syllogisms may he 
reduced not only to the first figure but to the two universal moods 
of the first figure either directly by conversion or indirectly by 
reductio ad absurdum 

h h 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

evident pnovided the premises be granted and in 
all the validity consists in the same thing which 
when stated generally constitutes the dictum 
above mentioned namely that whatever is 
affirmed or denied universally of any class of 
things may be affirmed or denied of any thing 
comprehended in that class in framing the 
argument then the object is to refer the subject 
of the conclusion to some class middle term 
of which class something can be affirmed or 
denied universally thus in the first syllogism 
the subject of the conclusion the world is 
referred to a class of things those which exhibit 
marks of design of which it can be universally 
affirmed that they had an intelligent author 
and so with the rest 

now the question is do men actually reason 
thus that they do not openly or apparently so 
reason every ones experience may convince 
him taking each of the six syllogisms in the 
first figure to which form the other figures may 
be reduced we shall see that in every case 
the natural or usual way of reasoning would 
be confined to the second and third propositions 
omitting the first in order to prove that the 
world had an intelligent author none but a 
dialectician would think of beginning by stating 
whatever exhibits marks of design had an 



beasonino 

intelligent author but an ordinary reasoner 
would say 

the world exhibits marks of design 

therefore it had an intelligent author and 
so in the other cases 

but though not expressed is not the first or 
major proposition understood mentally em 
braced though not stated in words there lies 
all the question 

when we examine these six syllogisms we 
find that the major is always an universal pro 
position and this in fact is one of the laws of 
the first figure as it is of syllogisms in general 
that one of the premises must be universal 
unless this be the case no infallible inference 
can be drawn if the major proposition be uni 
versal it must embrace the conclusion for this is 
only a particular instance of the same con 
sequently by assuming the major we assume the 
conclusion or in other words our first propo 
sition takes for granted the very thing to be 
proved and this we are told is the legitimate 
nay the only legitimate mode of reasoning 
certainly of all the delusions that ever passed 
current in the world this is the greatest for it 
is a delusion not peculiar to the vulgar but 
shared even now by some of the highest names 
in philosophy it is engendered between rever 



 introduction to mental philpht 

ence for antiquity and respect for aristotle and 
greek and in many instances it has proved too 
strong not only for common sense but for high 
intellectual powers on that account it is the 
more important that the delusion should be 
expelled 

aristotle shows prior analytics book i 
chap xxiv that unless one of the two proposi 
tions which compose the premises be universal 
there can be no syllogism thus says he if 
we have to demonstrate that music is a dignified 
pleasure if we state only that pleasure is digni 
fied without saying all pleasure there is no syllo 
gism strange that this acute philosopher 
should not have put the question to himself if 
all pleasure be dignified what occasion is there 
for reasoning to prove that the pleasure of music 
is so that question once fairly answered he 
might have spared himself the immense trouble 
of writing the prior analytics a mighty monu 
ment of useless ingenuity 

who i would ask starting from the major 
proposition of the syllogism would think of 
proving that caesar as a tyrant deserved death 
because all tyrants deserve death that is the 
very thing to he proved whether we use the 
singular or the plural it makes no difference 
for the general term tyrant comprehends as 



beaning 

many particulars as the phrase all tyrants 
what can be more silly than the statement a 
tyrant any tyrant deserves death becatise all 
tyrants deserve death but such and no other is 
the proof afforded us in this syllogism these 
two propositions are in reality identical they 
differ only in form we conclude that what 
instead of proving any thing begins by taking 
for granted the very thing to be proved cannot 
be the natural mode of reasoning 

moreover the above specimens of syllogism 
and others such as are usually found in books of 
logic in all the varieties of figure and mood do 
not answer to the definition of syllogism given 
by aristotle above viz that a syllogism is a 
speech in which certain propositions the pre 
mises being stated and granted some other pro 
position the conclusion different from these 
follows of necessity and this solely in virtue of 
the propositions stated now we have seen that 
the syllogisms constructed according to the rules 
of figure and mood and in agreement with the 
dictum of aristotle de omni et nullo as it is 
called really bring out in the conclusion nothing 
different from the premises therefore they do 
not correspond with the above definition which 
as we have shown agrees with demonstrative or 



 introduction to msntal philosophy 

mathematical reasoning only that definition is 
a definition of perfect or demonstrative reason 
ing and if we please to call it syllogistic well 
and good but then we must remember that such 
syllogisms are very diflperent from the syllogisms 
of the schools which alone we are now combat 
ing in these last the connection between the 
premises and the conclusion is no doubt irre 
sistible because the latter is assumed in the 
former but for that reason it can contain no 
thing new nothing different not so in real and 
perfect reasoning such as that of geometry 
where the conclusion not only follows irresistibly 
from the premises from both together but where 
it also contains something different from either 

in what then consists this admirable 
discovery of the syllogism asks barthlemy 
saint hilaire in the preface to his translation of 
aristotles organon in this answers he 
 that aristotle first established that reasoning 
was possible on the one condition alone of start 
ing from a principle to arrive by the aid of a 

what we have called plain reasoning approaches more 
nearly to the mathematical than any other and in some cases 
seems not to fall short of demonstration though the matter 
ahout which it is conversant he contingenty not necessary 
therefore though the conclusion follows irresistibly from the 
premises it may still be false 



reasoning 

middle term at a conclusion resulting necessarily 
from that principle according to this state 
ment there can be none but demonstrative 
reasoning first mistake again by this the 
conclusion in demonstrative reasoning follows 
necessarily from the principle as saint hilaire 
calls it or major proposition whereas in mathe 
matical reasoning it follows not from one of the 
premises alone but from both together second 
mistake in the simple reasoning a is equal to 
b and b to c therefore a is equal to c the 
conclusion certainly follows not necessarily from 
either of the two premises but from both and 
the one is no more entitled to be called a prin 
ciple than the other it is only in the fictitious 
reasoning of the syllogism that the conclusion 
follows necessarily from the major proposition 
because in that proposition the conclusion is taken 
for granted beforehand it may be remarked that 
logicians of a certain class are often at war with 
the mathematicians no wonder for no science 
so clearly refutes the absurd pretensions of the 
school logic as mathematics 

i am well aware that a very high authority in 
logic maintains that we cannot draw the simplest 
inference in mathematics without the use of an 
universal principle and that even the reasoning 
a is equal to b and b to c therefore a is equal 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

to c is elliptical stated in full we are told 
that reasoning would be as follows — 

what are equal to the same are equal to each 
other 

a and c are equal to the same b 

therefore a and c are equal to each other 

how is this question to be determined by 
an appeal to consciousness the supreme tribunal 
in metaphysics to consciouness then we do 
appeal and we maintain that the reasoning a is 
equal to b and b to c therefore a is equal to c 
is not elliptical that nothing is wanting to the 
evidence of the conclusion that the mind sees 
that conclusion as resulting from the premises 
at once and irresistibly does any one deny this 
evidence and ask for more proof we have no 
more to offer for we cannot give a demonstra 
tion of a demonstration as for what is called 
the full statement we deny that it is one whit 
more satisfactory than the other or that it is the 
natural mode of reasoning it is an artificial 
mode invented to prop up a theory by reducing 
mathematical reasoning to the syllogistic form 
we cannot of course support our denial by a 
formal proof for the first principles of reasoning 
admit not of proof but we confidently appeal to 
the consciousness of every man of common un 
derstanding 



reasoning 

we must not confound analysisy with general 
ization the reasoning a is equal to b and 
b to c therefore a is equal to c seems to 
admit of no analysis it is complete in all its 
parts all is expressed but when we come to 
compare this with other examples of reasoning 
we find that there is a striking similarity between 
them which similarity or point of agreement may 
be stated as a general principle and formalized 
in words thus things which are equal to the 
same are equal to one another this general 
principle then is said to pervade all such 
specimens of reasoning that is each is a par 
ticular instance thereof but we must not 
therefore suppose that each is proved from the 
general principle on the contrary but for the 
particular instances the general proposition would 
never have been thought of it comes after the 
particular proofs by a process of generalization 
forming an axiom convenient for the purpose of 
communicating knowledge and satisfactory to 
the mind of the learner as showing at a glance 
all that he is called upon to take for granted in 
the ensuing demonstration but it cannot be 
necessary to a proof which is evident without it 
and which actually was established without it 
for few will maintain that the geometrical dis 
coverer began by laying down axioms

 introduction to mental philosopht 

one question only now remains though the 
syllogism be not an accurate detailed statement 
derived from a correct analysis of the process of 
reasoning is it of any use as a testj a criterion of 
the validity of an argument in other words 
though false metaphysically can it serve any 
purpose logically 

if the syllogism be not an accurate statement 
of the full mental process in reasoning there is 
surely a strong probability a priori against its 
logical utility but let us examine this point 
separately 

when we consider the specimens given above 
or any others that are in due form we shall find 
that what the syllogism does is to point out in 
the major proposition what must be taken for 
granted in order that the inference may be 
irrefragable in other words that the conclusion 
may follow necessarily from the premises in 
order to show this necessary connexion or want 
of connexion the syllogism so states the case that 
the conclusion is evidently comprehended or not 
comprehended under the premises but then 
the major premiss taken for granted requires 
proof quite as much as the conclusion nay 
more for it comprehends it and more also and 
therefore though the inference be correct the 
conclusion may be utterly false and the reason 



reasoning 

why the inference is irrefragable is because the 
conclusion is taken for granted in the premises 
and if it be not taken for granted then the 
inference is not irrefragable the syllogism in 
fact shows nothing more than this that unless 
such a preliminary proposition be true we 
cannot be quite sure of the conclusion but as 
we can be quite sure of no matter of fact at 
least of no universal fact the conclusion must 
after all be hypothetical though we are apt 
erroneously to suppose that it is certain because 
the inference is correct 

the only conceivable use of the syllogism is 
to show us what large assumptions must be made 
if we would have a semblance of certainty and 
consequently that there is no real certainty but 
only probability the world exhibits marks of 
design that is which look like design there 
fore the world had an intelligent author it is 
true that this conclusion cannot be quite certain 
unless whatever exhibits marks of design had 
an intelligent author neither is it perfectly 
certain because csbsar was a tyrant there 
fore he deserved death unless all tyrants 
deserve death but what ought we to infer from 
this but that all our reasonings on matters of 
fact are fallible and liable to exceptions for in 
order that the conclusion may follow irresistibly 



 introduction to mbntal philosophy 

universal propositiods must be assumed to be 
true though as such they may be false to 
impress this truth on the mind seems to me the 
only possible advantage to be derived from the 
syllogism though its effect has been just the 
contrary for it has an appearance of perfect 
proof and certainty and though only an appear 
ance the fiction like other fictions is apt to 
impose upon the understanding and lead it into 
error 

the grand mistake of the syllogistic theory 
then is the notion that we can ever arrive at 
demonstration in reasonings about matters of 
fact and in carrying out this notion a form of 
reasoning was invented for invented is the word 
whereby the appearance and only the appearance 
of infallibility was given to an argument the 
very perfection of the proof in a regular syllo 
gism shows the futility of the argument for 
we know that except in mathematics there is no 
perfect proof and consequently the perfection 
can be only apparent and therefore the result of 
a trick this trick as we have seen is assuming 
the conclusion in the premises 

that a system of logic raised on such a basis 
should so long have stood its ground and that 
even at the present day it should have eminent 
supporters is certainly one of the most extra 



beasoming 

ordinary facts in the history of the human mind 

to the name the truly great name of aristotle 
must chiefly be attributed this long delusion a 
man distinguished in so many branches of 
science in metaphysics ethics politics rhe 
toric criticism and natural history the tutor 
of alexander the founder of the peripatetic 
philosophy assuredly the writings of aristotle 
have shed a light on the world but the great 
power of the philosopher is chiefly shown in this 
that he bewildered it so long 

to take an instance formerly given suppose 
that either by induction or otherwise we have 
arrived at this general proposition that 

trade ought to be free 
we may thence infer directly that 

the corn trade ought to be free 

here the conclusion follows from the premises 
follows probably but not infallibly for the pro 
position trade ought to be free though general 
is not stated as universal and therefore there 
may be circumstances peculiar to the com trade 
which make it an exception to the rule but 
this is the natural mode of reasoning now if 
we wish to convert this into a syllogism we must 
state the argument thus 

all trade ought to be free 

the corn trade is a trade 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

therefore it ought to be free 

here by assuming too much we render the 
argument insignificant for we assume the eon 
elusion in the major premiss 

it is a very fair argument to infer because 
trade in general ought to be free that the corn 
trade ought to be free it is an argument drawn 
from a general proposition or a general principle 
as the common phrase is in other words an in 
stance of deductive reasoning but it is no 
argument to say that the corn trade ought to be 
free because all trade ought to be free this is 
simply a begging of the question it is to say 
that there can now be no dispute about the mat 
ter that it has been already decided take another 
instance our general proposition may be 

 a local legislature is advantageous to a 
country whence we may infer that 

 a local legislature in ireland would be ad 
vantageous to that country 

this is a fair argument but as the proposition 
pretends not to universality there may be cir 
cumstances peculiar to ireland which render the 
general rule inapplicable or on the contrary 
there may in this case be circumstances which 
render a local legislature peculiarly desirable 

when brought to the forna of a syllogism the 
argument becomes as follows 



reasoning 

every country is benefited by a local legis 
lature 

ireland is a country 

therefore ireland would be benefited by a 
local legislature 

here again it is evident that by assuming 
too much we do away with the argument alto 
gether we prove nothing we show the pro 
bability of nothing we suppose the question 
already settled 

again supposing ourselves convinced of the 
truth of this general proposition that the law 
ought to favour the equal partition of property 
among all the children of a family daughters as 
well as sons it may still be a question whether 
there be any circumstances peculiar to land 
which justify an exception but if we begin by 
an universal affirmation that all property ought 
to be equally divided there is an end at once to 
reasoning 

humes famous argument against miracles 
which is contained in a single sentence may be 
easily reduced to the form of a syllogism in the 
first figure and for that very reason it is nuga 
tory a miracle is a violation of the laws of 
nature and as a firm and unalterable experience 
has established those laws the proof against a 
miracle from the very nature of the fact is as 



 introduction to biental philpht 

entire as any argument from experience can 
possibly be imagined in due syllogistic form 
the argument would stand thus 

whatever is opposed to a firm and unalter 
able experience is unworthy of credit 

but a miracle being a violation of the laws 
of nature is so opposed 

therefore a miracle is unworthy of credit 

the fallacy here lies in assuming in the minor 
premiss that there is a firm and unalterable ex 
perience against a miracle for there exists a 
great deal of testimony for miracles and until 
it be proved that all that testimony is false it 
cannot be assumed that there is an invariable 
experience against them for testimony is in 
direct experience and upon it by far the greater 
part of our knowledge depends even the major 
premiss may be contested if by firm and 
unalterable experience be meant and what else 
can be meant the experience of ourselves our 
ancestors and all whom we have known or heard 
of then those born and bred between the tropics 
and who have never wandered from thence ought 
not to believe in ice in fact there is scarcely 
any universal proposition that may not be con 
tested and therefore dialecticians have been 
obliged in order not to expose the hollowness of 
their art to have recourse to trifling examples 



reasoning 

such as all men are mortal james is a man 
therefore he is mortal all men are sinners 
john is a man therefore he is a sinner where 
they knew that the major would not be dis 
puted aristotle was more wary for he stuck to 
letters and thus concealed the insignificance of 
examples 

thus the major premiss of the syllogism is 
in general either a truism or an unwarranted 
assumption and therefore though the inference 
be irresistible yet the conclusion must be either 
trifling or uncertain but whatever it be it is 
no more as we have already seen than what was 
previously known being assumed in the premises 
we cannot therefore wonder that the syllogistic 
art in spite of its great pretensions should have 
contributed so little or rather not at all to the 
advancement of knowledge 

if the argument of hume had not laid claim 
to infallibility it could not have been reduced to 
the form of a perfect syllogism it would have 
remained a good but an obvious argument 
namely that prior to the examination of the 
particular fact there is a probability nay a 
strong probability against any one miracle on 
account of the general uniformity of nature 
but general experience could not answer the 
purpose of an infallible conclusion and there 

k k 



 introduction to bffental philosophy 

fore unalterable or universal experience was 
assumed and it is exactly by reason of this 
assumption that the argument becomes re 
ducible to a syllogism and as a demonstration 
is deceitful 

we have seen that the grand error which lies at 
the bottom of the syllogistic theory is the notion 
that we can ever arrive at demonstration about 
matters of experience and in carrjring out this 
notion it was found necessary to assume for 
premises universal propositions instead of general 
ones this is the precise difference between 
the ordinary or natural mode of reasoning that 
is of deductive or general reasoning and the 
artificial or syllogistic we may reason from 
general propositions that is we may attempt to 
show that any particular case is comprehended 
under a general truth but we cannot reason 
from universal propositions for these obviate 
the necessity of reasoning we reason in order 
to prove something not known before but if it 
be already known why reason 

so far concerning deductive reasoning and 
the syllogism the insuperable objection to which 
last is that it presents a form of reasoning in 
applicable to any real discourse that under the 
semblance of a perfect or infallible argument it 
in fact does away with all argument 



rbasoninq 

when i consider the reasons on which this 
conclusion is built they appear to me so clear 
and cogent that here i could rest in full con 
viction but when i reflect on the fact that for 
many ages and throughout all civilized europe 
the syllogism was adopted and that still some of 
the greatest thinkers defend it i am almost 
tempted to fall back into scepticism and to dis 
card metaphysics and logic altogether as destined 
perpetually to puzzle never to satisfy mankind 
to avoid this scepticism this unmanly despair 
i am forced to rebel against authority and main 
tain the liberty of thought 

when men have been wedded to a system 
they will not desert it even when it leads them to 
absurdities one might have thought that the 
following passage was a pretty good refutation 
of the syllogistic theory of the schools a real 
reducho ad absurdum but no the author adopts 
the conclusion since all reasoning in the sense 
above defined may be resolved into syllogisms 
and since even the objectors to logic make it a 
subject of complaint that in a syllogism the 
premises do virtually assert the conclusion it 
follows at once that no new truth as above 
defined can be elicited by a process of reason 
ing thus in order to maintain the syllogistic 

 whatelyb logic book iv chap ii 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

theory we must allow that no new truth can be 
elicited by reasoning the only use of reasoning 
then as we are told is to expand and unfold the 
assertions wrapt up as it were and implied in 
those with which we set out and to bring a 
person to perceive and acknowledge the full 
force of that which he has admitted to con 
template it in various points of view to admit 
in one shape what he has already admitted in 
another and to give up and disallow whatever is 
inconsistent with it according to this theory 
when pythagoras established by reasoning that in 
any right angled triangle the square of the side 
subtending the right angle is equal to the squares 
of the two other sides he made no discovery he 
only unfolded what was before wrapt up in some 
general notion common to him and other men 
some one or more of the mathematical axioms 
must we then allow that the above famous pro 
position is as much contained within the axiom 
things which are equal to the same are equal to 
one another or some other similar as that the 
proposition james is mortal is contained 
within all men are mortal no one not 
blinded by system will maintain such a doctrine 
for a moment but the syllogistic theory was 
to be supported even at the expense of reason 

 whatelys logic book iv chap ii 



reasoning 

ing which required to be depreciated in order to 
suit an artificial and futile system 

as reasoning is depreciated in order to suit 
the syllogistic theory so are the truths of pure 
mathematics we are told that all the proposi 
tions of pure mathematics are what locke calls 
 trifling wherein the predicate is merely a part 
of the complex idea implied by the subject 
thus when we assert taking the above example 
that in a right angled triangle the square des 
cribed on the side which subtends the right 
angle is equal to the squares described on the 
two sides containing the right angle we state 
merely a trifling proposition one included in the 
meaning of the word right angled triangle if 
so it ought to be included in the definition 
thereof but the definition says nothing about it 
the supposition is evidently preposterous 

again the truths of mathematics are repre 
sented by the same author as in conformity not 
with the nature of things but only with our own 
hypotheses our own definitions and therefore 
comparatively insignificant there is some founda 
tion no doubt for this statement the truths of 
mathematics are not quite conformable to the 
nature of things they are strictly true only on 
a given hypothesis or definition but then they 
are so far in agreement with the nature of exter 
nal things that the nearer things external ap 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

proach to the things defined the more nearly 
does the practical result correspond to the ideal 
conclusion therefore mathematical truths are 
not mere ingenious theorems hut pregnant with 
useful application 

before me the author of the philosophy of 
rhetoric as well as dr thomas brown objected 
to the syllogism as necessarily involving a petitio 
principii dr whately does not attempt to prove 
the contrary but he answers that the same ob 
jection lies against all arguments whatever all 
arguments involve a petitio principii am i 
wrong then in saying that all reasoning is de 
preciated in order to suit an artificial and futile 
system after this i need not add another 
word upon the syllogism 

v thus we have been able to distinguish 
three kinds of probable reasoning the inductive 
the deductive and the plain of which the two 
former have more affinity to each other than to 
the third we are aware that according to some 
all reasoning is of two kinds the inductive and 
the deductive that one author maintains all pro 
bable reasoning to be deductive or as he calls it 
analytic and another that all is inductive 

 the words in italics are so printed in the original 

 dr t brown maintains that all reasoning except the 
mathematical or proportional as he calls it is analytic while 
mr mill seems to think that all reasoning is in reality inductive 



reasoning 

but it certainly does not appear from an ex 
amination of particular instances that all pro 
bable reasonings can be classed under these two 
heads much less all reasonings whatsoever 

premature generalization is the bane of science 
and principia media are more applicable and more 
fruitful than principia generalissima by general 
izing prematurely we have always to begin 
afresh nothing is gained whereas by advancing 
more cautiously we establish one position at 
least whence we may hope in time to take a 
higher flight bacon has observed that the 
grand error of philosophers before his time 
consisted in this that from particulars they rose 
at once to extreme generalities whence they 
endeavoured to deduce every thing whereas 
the true method of progress is to advance by 
degrees from one step of generalization to 
another even unto the highest 

meanwhile let us examine what relations are 
the proper subject of each of these sorts of 
reasoning for we have seen that all reasoning 
consists in the tracing of relations 

the subject of demonstrative reasoning is the 
relations of quantity and those alone the first 
subject of inductive reasoning is the relation of 
resemblance one of amazing extent by means of 
which we arrive also by induction at the know 



 introduction to mental philobophy 

ledge of other relations those of cause and 
effect 

the relations traced by deductive reasoning 
are those of comprehension of a whole to a 
part as when we show that a particular proposi 
tion is comprehended under a general one the 
policy of a free trade in corn for instance un 
der the policy of free trade in general se 
quences of cause and effect are traced by plain 
reasoning as in the examples above given a is 
the cause of b and b of c therefore a is the 
remote cause of c relations of position also 
are traced by this sort of reasoning as in the 
following instance 

york is further from london than stamford 
and edinburgh is further from london than 
york much more then is edinburgh further 
from london than stamford 

from the first proposition a person totally 
unacquainted with the position of edinburgh 
could infer nothing and from the second propo 
sition one unacquainted with the position of 
stamford could infer nothing both therefore 
are necessary to the conclusion which is not 
comprehended under either 

 such relations of position are in reality relations of 
quantity and so admit of demonstrative reasoning 



beasonino 

vi it will be observed that we have not 
attempted as some have to establish an univer 
sal principle of reasoning because we very much 
doubt whether any such principle exist we 
have seen that all reasoning consists in tracing 
relations and since these are various it is natural 
to presume that the principles of reasoning may 
be so too even in mathematical reasoning the 
most simple of any for it embraces but one kind 
of relation clearly distinguished from all other 
relations and having its own differences ac 
curately marked out there is more than one 
fundamental principle or axiom surely then it is 
unlikely that there can be but one principle for 
all probable reasoning which embraces various 
and complicated relations the case of mathe 
matics proves at least that all reasoning is not 
based upon one principle things which are 
equal to the same are equal to one another 
and if equals be added to equals the wholes are 
equal are not one axiom but two 

do we clearly understand what is meant by a 
principle of reasoning p it is a general truth of 
which each inference is a particular instance a 
truth either selfevident as in mathematics or 
at least to be taken for certain since it is in 
capable of proof and at the same time indis 
pensable to the proof of other propositions in 

l l 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

this the validity of an inference consists and 
upon it conviction depends considered in 
respect to the reasoning itself it is an invariahle 
constituent or element in respect to the in 
fluence on the mind a cause for as we have 
seen a principle may be either constituent or 
elemental or else causal 

although we do not pretend to lay down one 
universal principle of reasoning yet we may 
arrive at some general truths on this subjects 
since all reasoning consists in tracing relations 
and since these are either of coexistence or of 
succession it follows that the object of reasoning 
is to prove either that two or more things coexist 
or do not coexist or that two or more things 
succeed or do not succeed each other generally 
if not invariably the object of science in 
particular is to determine the permanent or 
invariable coexistence and succession of things 
partly by direct observation and where that 
fails by reasoning or inference where one 
thing is known certainly to exist there to expect 
another along with it or where one thing is 
ascertained to look for another after it such 
are the anticipations of human science 

coexistence and succession being two such 
different relations it does seem improbable that 

° see article principle 



reasoning 

the very same maxims of reasoning should apply 
to both but let us see whether we cannot deter 
mine some which are applicable separately to each 

relations of coexistence 

under this head come all the axioms of pure 
mathematics which are well known and there 
fore need not here be stated the following 
maxims are applicable to other sorts of reasoning 

 if the first always coexist with the 
second and the second with the third then will 
the third always coexist with the first 

 and vice versa if the first never coexist 
with the second and if the second always coexist 
with the third then will the third never coexist 
with the first 

relations of succession 

 what has been will be 

 every effect has a chain of causes 

 one effect may have many concomitant 
causes 

 an effect may be prevented not merely by 
the absence of the cause or causes proper to it 
but also by opposing causes therefore the 
absence of an effect proves not the absence of 
a tendency 

maocim applicable to hath kinds of relation 

 two or more things which resemble each 
other in many observed particulars will be found 



 introduction to mental philosophy 

to agree in other nonobserved particulars from 
the appearances of agreement we may infer 
either that the composition of the things in 
question is similar or that the changes which 
they undergo or produce are similar the rela 
tion of resemblance is peculiar in this that it 
may be a relation either of coexistence or of 
succession for there may be similarity of 
sequence as well as of composition 

relations of resemblance are the foundation 
not only of all classification and hence of the 
descriptive sciences or natural history but also 
of reasonings concerning cause and effect and 
therefore of philosophy nay it is the peculiar 
office of the imagination to trace relations of 
resemblance not so much for the sake of truth 
as of effect or emotion fortunate then is that 
mind which is alive to relations of resemblance 
whether it thread the mazes of science or follow 
the flowerj paths of eloquence and poetry and 
valuable is that memory wherein things suggest 
others from similarity and not from mere con 
tiguity in place or in time
