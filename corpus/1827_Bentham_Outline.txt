i had been for some time engaged in revising
and completing a mass of manuscripts which my
uncle mr jeremy bentham had put into my
hands and in drawing up a general treatise of
the science when i heard of the publication of
dr whately√¢Äôs √¢Äúelements of logic√¢Äù having
procured this work a first glance convinced me
that the author had done much towards divesting
the science of that useless jargon of those un
meaning puerilities with which it had been
loaded by the schoolmen and which being the
only apparent result of their efforts have cast

so much opprobrium and ridicule on the very



name of logic on a more careful perusal of
the work dr whately appeared to me to have
pointed out in a very able manner several of

vi

prefa c e

these errors of his predecessors and to have gone
over the field of the science such as he had

marked it out with great attention on his

part

and consequent advantage to the learner still
however i saw much remaining to be done
some errors presented themselves to me in that

part which dr whately had investigated in the

closest manner and other topics which i had
been led to consider as the most important were
barely touched upon by him from these con

siderations i thought it might perhaps be at
tended with some use to logical students were i
to point out the instances where these elements

appeared to be susceptible of improvement in
point of clearness or accuracy as well as those

where i thought the subject might require
further development and were i at the same

time in order to enable the reader to judge the
better of the accuracy of my observations to
give on each occasion a general analysis of the

principal topics treated of in the larger work i
am preparing and i am the more induced thus

to publish immediately an outline of the new
system which i purposed developing in that

general treatise as various circumstances may
render it adviseable that i should delay the com
t

vii

preface

pletion of the larger work till my ideas have be

come more certain and fixed with regard to some
of the details

in pursuance of this plan i have not on the
present occasion departed materially from the

order adopted by dr whately but have endea
voured to follow him step by step comparing

his view of every portion of the field with that

which mr bentham has taken of it in the above
mentioned manuscripts in as far as the subject
has been there treated of and with my own ideas
in regard to those parts which mr bentham had
left untouched

f

the reader may perhaps consider that i have
devoted too much space to the critical examina
tion of dr whately√¢Äôs work and may ask why i

have not extended my remarks to other logical
treatises my reason for this preference has
been merely because i look upon the elements

in question as the last and most improved edition
of the aristotelian system that therefore it is
useless to say any thing more of the errors which
he has corrected or of the superfluities which he
has eliminated and that by criticising whatever

appeared to me still to be defective in dr
whatelys work my strictures would apply not

preface

so much to any individual system of his as to
the aristotelian logic in general as improved by
this his last commentator

i have also omitted all mention of french

logical writers who consider the subject in a
totally different light from that in which british
authors have viewed it condillac first rejected

the whole aristotelian theory and applied the
name of logic to the enquiry into the mode of

action of our intellectual faculties since then
destutt de tracy in the commencement of the
present century published four volumes of ele

ments of ideology including one of logic which
have become the standard to which the subse

quent continental writers have generally referred
his principles are founded on those of condillac 
he suppresses not only the theory of syllogisms

of our
intellectual faculties confining the science to
√¢Äúpure speculation√¢Äù unapplied to any practical
use i read over his work some years ago and

but also all rules for the

on the present occasion i have looked into it
again for the purpose of comparing his ideas
with mine but i found his √¢Äúlogic√¢Äù so totally
different from the branch of art and science to

which i have applied that name that i thought

ix

preface

it would be a needless waste of time were i to
enter into any analysis of his doctrines more
particularly as clearness of exposition order in
the ideas or systematic connection of the various
principles and theories are qualities which it
would be vain to search for in his √¢Äúelements of

ideology√¢Äù



the abovementioned manuscripts of mr
bentham√¢Äôs were written chiefly in the year 
some

however

bear a date as old as and

for the last fifteen years they had not been looked
into with the exception of such as were revised
for insertion in the appendix to chrestomathia

published in the year the subject upon
which they give the fullest details is that which
may be called the tactical part of logic com
prehending the rules of exposition and of me
thod the ratiocinative part or that which
relates to reasoning which in the eyes of most

logicians constitutes the whole of the science
had not yet been entered upon by mr bentham
the rules or systems which i may in such cases
propose to substitute for dr whately√¢Äôs being
thus entirely my own are here given with far
less confidence than those which relate to the

tactical part

but with regard to these also

mr bentham must not be considered as respon
sible for the principles i have exhibited his ma
nuscripts not having been prepared for the press
are in many instances in a state far from com
pletion and in others the subject may have ap
peared to me in a different light from that in
which he had viewed it it is to myself there
fore that the reader must attribute any errors he
may observe in the details of my system of
which however the leading principles must be
considered as founded on those of mr bentham

introductory remarks

in reading over the elegant exposition of his
views which dr whately has prefixed to his

elements of logic i felt that i generally con
curred in his observations on the utility of logic
in his refutation of the arguments of its detrac
tors√¢Äîof those who set up common sense in op
position to logic√¢Äîand in his remarks on the
erroneous system proceeded upon with regard to
this subject in our university education the
absurdity of comprehending within the province
of logic every branch of art or science to which

it may be applicable will readily be admitted by
any reader but on the other hand it may per
haps appear to him that the author of the ele
ments has fallen in some measure into the oppo
site error of restricting too much the field of the
science this is a point however which will be

ch

i

introductory

more properly considered when we come to the
examination of the definition of logic at pre
sent i must devote a few pages to some observa
tions suggested by the perusal of dr whately√¢Äôs
preface

the author excuses himself for censuring
several of the doctrines and explanations of logi
cal writers and of aldrich in particular on this
occasion he appears to me to go farther than is ne
cessary and upon the whole the commendations
given to aldrich√¢Äôs compendium are probably
greater than the work is deserving of however
i must now apply the same excuses to my own
case if in the remarks contained in the follow

ing pages criticism will be found to occupy more
space than eulogium it is not from any desire to
depreciate the value of the improvements here
introduced into the science but from the con

sideration of the greater practical use resulting
from the investigation of the matter of disagree
ment than from a detailed repetition of those
doctrines in which my views coincide with those

expressed by the author in question should my
remarks be deemed inapposite or incorrect the
reader may at least have been led by their means
to form a bettergrounded judgment

remarks



in adverting to the style which he has

adopted the object stated by dr whately as
that which he had in view is so strictly what
should be wished that i cannot do better than

transcribe this short paragraph
√¢Äúwith regard to the style i have considered
perspicuity not only as it always must be the
first point but as one of such paramount import
ance in such a subject as to justify the neglect√¢Äù
the comparative neglect i should rather say √¢Äúof
all others prolixity of explanation√¢Äîhomeliness

in illustration√¢Äîand baldness of expression i have
regarded as blemishes not worth thinking of
when any thing was to be gained in respect of
clearness√¢Äù elements√¢Äîpreface p xxii
generally speaking the result answers to the
expectations raised by the above paragraph
and not confining himself to the qualifications
which he deems to be necessary he has also suc

ceeded in combining elegance and dignity of
language with that perspicuity which on scien
tific subjects has the precedence over every other
qualification he falls but rarely into any of the
three defects which he very properly describes as
more than pardonable wherever clearness would
otherwise be sacrificed if his style is in any re
b 



ch i

introductory

spect to be blamed it is rather for the occasional
departure from the precepts which he has thus
laid down for a disposition to wander into that
elegant rhetorical confusion which is so apt to
lead the reader astray and sometimes to convey

a notion an erroneous one i have little doubt
of that the author himself has not always a
very clear idea of the import of his lan
guage



√¢Äúornaments of style√¢Äù says he page 
√¢Äúsuch as metaphor epithet antithesis c√¢Äù are
√¢Äúby no means necessarily adverse to perspicuity
but rather in many cases conducive to it√¢Äù√¢Äî
to a certain degree fiction is not only con
ducive to perspicuity but no discourse can be

carried on without it

no operation of the mind

none of its qualities nothing that has any rela
tion to it can in general be expressed but by
metaphorically comparing them to those which
relate to really existing objects for ex my mind
comprehends retains an idea my idea on the sub
ject is enlarged restricted cleared up defined
c all these are expressions quite as figura

tive and even more so than that of a vessel
ploughing the ocean the mind is supposed to

be a vessel or receptacle which comprehends ie



remarks

encloses or retains i e prevents escaping

keeps in confinement an idea which
supposed to be a real object

again is
again idea is

supposed to be a collective term designative of a
set of real bodies one of these is defined to be the

one which lies upon another body which is called
the subject from subjaceo and this body lying
upon another is described as being increased or
diminished in bulk cleared up ie by the re
moval of objects which hid it from us defined
ie by fixing limits to separate it from other con
tiguous bodies c
this necessary defect in all human languages
√¢Äînecessary because it is the result of the con
formation of our minds√¢Äîis the perpetual antago
nist to perspicuity obliged to describe as real
what is only fiction and what the narrator intends
should be understood as fictitious he is in con

tinual danger of seeing the idea of reality attached
to it by the reader in a greater or less degree or
still more so of seeing the connection between
the two differently conceived by the different
minds to which his discourse is directed

this

is the source of most of the deceptions which

prevail in every stage of human intercourse and



ch

i

introductory

this it is that renders rhetorical language so easy
an instrument of delusion and erroneous persua
sion

where correct information and conse

quently perspicuity in language is the object the
greatest attention should be paid to employ in
preference to others such figures as have by long
use lost as it were their original sense or
where that object cannot be accomplished to use

such others as represent ideas as analogous as
possible to the particular one intended

to per

sist in the same figure beyond the point where
analogy ceases between the metaphor and its
type is directly productive of erroneous concep
tion to represent the same idea by metaphors

derived partly from one partly from another
source generates confusion to combine figura
tive expressions in a manner in which the real
types could not have been combined gives to the
whole an air of absurdity yet nothing is more
common among those who like the author of

the elements are apt to give way to a general
propensity for decoration in their style i do
not deny that most of his figures are good and
appropriate but one is apt to be startled at meet

ing with such expressions as the following

remarks

√¢Ä¢ 



√¢Äúthey overlooked the boundless field that was
before them within the legitimate limits of the
science√¢Äù p 
another instance of inappropriate figures is that
of building a science to √¢Äúbuild morals into a
science√¢Äù occurs in p and again in p 
he says that a certain collection of rules cannot be
√¢Äúbuilt into a regular sciel ce√¢Äù in the latter in
stance i have not been able to form any clear idea
of his meaning for it is difficult to conceive

that the knowledge of any collection of rules for

the performance of any operation or indeed
that the knowledge of any one such rule does
not constitute a portion of science
a slight deficiency in point of perspicuity
may also be observed in another respect this
is in the occasional entanglement of sentences a

species of confusion the source of which may be
traced to the same pursuit of elegance√¢Äîa most
desirable quality one with which but few are 
really gifted√¢Äîbut which in a scientific treatise
should never be opposed to perspicuity the
long sentence on plainness which occupies two
thirds of p may serve as an instance of this

defect and in general the long parentheses which



ch i

introductory

occur throughout the work are the occasion of

much strain upon the readers attention
the frequent use of the letters ie and eg
abbreviations of the latin words id est and erem
pligratia is also productive of inconvenience to

the reader they are usually read that is and
for example words which bear no apparent

analogy to their signs in the eyes of anyone who
is not a latin scholar and even if the reader be

acquainted with that language he must perform
the additional operation of translation before he
can pronounce these words the use of these

abbreviations is of old standing but i think
there might be much gained by substituting

for e g at least the abbreviation for er now
much more generally adopted

let not any of my own defects in style be
objected against these remarks every author

is ready to detect the inaccuracies in the style of

others and to consider himself as a competent
judge but few can be convinced of those of
their own writings and this for a very plain
reason independent of all selflove every person
being necessarily more accustomed to his own

arrangement of ideas than to that of any other
person



remarks



the general arrangement of the subject
matter of dr whately√¢Äôs elements appears to
be well calculated to answer their professed object

√¢Äîfirst the introducing into the field of syllogistic
reasoning one who is as yet wholly unacquainted
with the science and the giving a moredetailed in

struction to the scholar who has already acquired
some general notions with this view after hav

ing in the introduction defined the science and
dissipated in a great measure the clouds in which
former logicians have wrapped the whole subject

the author proceeds to give an analytical outline
calculated to convey a general idea of the endin
view and of the subjectmatter in as clear and in
telligible a manner as can be done without entering
into minute details

the several elements of the

science are next investigated and gradually put
together and combined in that part which he has

denominated a synthetical compendium and the
remainder of the work refers to subjects which
he considers not as appertaining to logic but as

being so intimately connected with it as to
require the entering into some details for the
purpose of exhibiting the distinctions by which
they become excluded from the field
in the treatise which as above mentioned i




ch i

remarks

am preparing i have followed a plan in some
respects analogous to this one but as i have
extended so much further the limits of the field

and as i differ from him as to the comparative
importance of its several parts correspondent

modifications will be seen in the details of my
plan those subjects which he considers as con
nected only with the field are by mr bentham
included within it and the subjectmatter of dr
whately√¢Äôs last chapters are therefore interwoven
with the rest of the treatise on the present
occasion however for the purpose of facilitating

the comparison of our respective systems i shall
with few exceptions follow the arrangement
adopted in dr whately√¢Äôs elements



chapter ii

definition of logic

in every treatise whether for the purpose of
elementary instruction or for that of completing
and methodizing the stock of knowledge already
acquired it is most important that the author
should begin by distinctly stating his object and
subject√¢Äîthe end that he wishes to attain and the

subjectmatter on which he purposes to work
by this mode of proceeding the reader having
in view the same end as the author is enabled to

keep pace with him during the whole course of
his progress and the author himself is the better
assured of not wandering from the paths which
lead to that end

thus in these elements of

logic dr whately sets out by a definition of
the artandscience he treats of according to his
ideas on the subject together with a critical
examination of the extent ascribed to it by former
logicians

though this definition be not given in that ri
gorous and precise manner which might have been



ch ii

definition

wished yet the authors meaning upon the whole
may be ascertained with tolerable clearness he
has in particular brought to view one very im

portant fact overlooked by all his predecessors
though so obvious when once exhibited as to
make us wonder that it should not have been

remarked viz that logic is a science as well as
an art the universally prevailing error that hu
man knowledge is divided into a number of
parts some of which are arts without science
and others sciences without art has been fully
exposed by mr bentham in his chrestomathia
there also it has been shown that there

cannot

exist a single art that has not its corresponding
science nor a single science which is not accom

panied by some portion of art the schoolmen
on the contrary have with extraordinary effort

endeavoured to prove that logic is an art only
not a science and in that particular instance dr
whately is i believe one of the first who has
ventured to contradict this illfounded assertion

 chrestomathia c by jeremy bentham london 
and part i p and √¢Äúessai sur la nomenclature et la

classification des principales branches dart et science√¢Äù
paris p the latter is a short essay founded on the
former work and which i published in french in 

of



logic

next as to the field appertaining to this art
andscience there is a wide difference between

the extent ascribed to it by dr whately and that
which appears to me to be best suited to the ordi
nary acceptation of the word logic in the
elements the science in question is restricted

to mere correct reasoning or in the precise
language adopted by mr bentham to the opera
tion of ratiocination and yet further to that
ratiocination alone which can produce absolute

conviction viz to syllogistic ratiocination or
deduction√¢Äîto the rules for the correct perform
ance of this operation and to that scientific know
ledge of its subjectmatter and object which is
necessary for the purpose
mr bentham defines logic to be√¢Äî√¢Äúthat
branch of artandscience which has for its object
or endinview the giving to the best advantage
to the human mind direction in the pursuit of

every branch of human knowledge√¢Äù a definition
founded upon that of saunderson√¢Äî√¢Äúars instru
mentalis dirigens mentem nostram in cognitionem
omnium intelligibilium√¢Äù


neither of the above definitions answer to the

idea i should be disposed to entertain of the sub
ject in question

that of dr whately confines



ch ii

definition

it to matter which of itself appears to me of so

little importance that it may be very doubtful
whether even all the eloquence he displays on the
occasion together with his practical simplification
of the science can ever bring logic into general
repute and upon some occasions he may per
haps himself be found to have used the word in a
more extensive and at the same time more ordi

nary and less obnoxious sense mr benthams
definition on the other hand might be so con
strued as to comprehend every other branch of

art and science thus rendering logic synony
mous to universal knowledge

in the endea

vour to avoid these opposite defects i had defined
logic to be√¢Äî√¢Äúthe branch of artandscience

which has for its object the advantageous applica
tion of the human mind to the study of any other
branch of artandscience√¢Äù

if accurately analyzed it may be found that
this definition cannot infer the extension of the

science to any spot which is the exclusive domain
of any other branch but to such only as are com
mon to all it does not imply √¢Äúsuch a system
of universal knowledge as should instruct us

in the full meaning or meanings of every term
and the truth or falsity√¢Äìcertainty or uncertainty

of

logic





√¢Äîof every proposition thus superseding all
other studies√¢Äù but relates merely to directions for
attaining and transmitting any such knowledge

or instruction it does not refer to particular
subjects but to such modes of proceeding as are
universally applicable to artandscience what
ever be the subjectmatter in question
in dr whatelys preface p x the subject of
logic is supposed to be expressed by the answer
to the question √¢Äúwhat is the most appropriate
intellectual occupation of man as man √¢Äù mean
ing as it is evident from the subsequent develop
ment of the question what is the universal
occupation of man as distinguished from brutes
whatever be his particular pursuits
the
author answers √¢Äúevidently in reasoning√¢Äù i
should say √¢Äúin the exercise of his intellectual
faculties√¢Äù knowledge it is true cannot be
made use of unless belief be attached to it

and the producing that belief is certainly one
of the important operations of the mind but
it does not constitute the whole of that universal

occupation which distinguishes man from brute
√¢Äîwhich constitutes the animal rationale

has

any one of the brute creation been observed to

define for instance or to class objects under



ch ii

definition

genera and species√¢Äîor are these operations less
universally applicable than the deduction of a
conclusion from two premises√¢Äù
on this occasion one might be led to sup


pose that the author had fallen in some measure
into the error with which he very properly

reproaches locke√¢Äîthat of confounding reason
with ratiocination√¢Äîreason in its ordinary sense

viz that use of the mental faculties which dis
tinguishes man from other animals with ratio
cination as above defined that is the process of
deducing or inferring one proposition from one
or more others thus it is that he probably
considered that man as man is endowed with

reason therefore reasoning is the characteristic
operation performed by man
but logic is to be still further restricted


it is not to the whole field of ratiocination that

the word reasoning is to be applied but it
is henceforth confined to syllogistic

argument

which mathematical argument is a species

of

it is

true that this alone can strictly speaking produce 
absolute conviction but how few are the cases

 this is a fallacious argument referrible to the head
denominated hereafter fallacy of paronymity see ch xi



of logic

where such reasoning can be put in practice

how much are we not every day every moment of
our life obliged to reason by analogy for in
stance the latter species of reasoning is indeed
more subject to fallacy than any other there is no
test to prove absolutely that any one argument
founded on analogy is not fallacious but is that
a reason for discarding it altogether from the field

of ratiocination if we cannot prove otherwise

than by analogy that food will satisfy our hunger
should we therefore dispense with food

the

force of each particular argument is founded it
is true upon the nature of the particular observa
tions made with relation to it and is therefore the

subjectmatter of the application not of the science
of logic but so much of the mode of operation
as can be abstracted from particular cases in this

case as well as in that of syllogistic reasoning
is assuredly contained in the answers to the above
mentioned question and is therefore equally

entitled to be classed under the head of logic
but moreover reasoning whether deductive
or inductive is not the only universal intellectual
occupation of man whatever be the subject
matter of his thoughts in order to derive any

degree of advantage from them he must be able
c



ch ii

definition

to learn and to retain the ideas of others and
to communicate his ownand in order to

derive the greatest possible advantage from them
he must be able to improve them that is to form

in

his own mind new combinations wherever

such combinations may be usefully made for

when will the time come when any man may
be assured of having arrived at perfection on any
one subject all general rules for accomplish
ing these several purposes that is all such as are
independent of any particular subjectmatter of

knowledge form in my idea an independent
branch

of artandscience√¢Äîone which should

be entered upon and studied separately by all
who intend to devote their time to scientific

pursuits√¢Äîone of which the practical rules are
afterwards applicable with the greatest possible
advantage to every art and science and without
which in a greater or less degree no one can
be studied with an adequate use to this aggre

gate branch i have given the name of logic
and among the subdivisions of its field i include
ratiocination both deductive and inductive√¢Äî

one of which alone constitutes logic according
to dr whately√¢Äôs idea other authors again have
still more extended or restricted the sense of this

of

logic



word but in too vague a manner to render any ex
planation necessary on the present occasion as to
which of these several subjects should be defi

nitively regarded as the matter of logic this may
be admitted to be a √¢Äúmere verbal

question

relating to the extension not of the science but
of the name√¢Äù elements p but do not

let us confound together the whole with its part
do not let us for the sake of a word refrain from
dispelling the thick cloud which darkens this
spotat a time too when in physical science it
is thought advantageous to overwhelm us with a
deluge of hard words on the most insignificant
subjects
if there be a reason for applying any deno
mination become vague and indeterminate by
long and evervarying use to one of its senses


more than to another it is in favour of that

sense in which its use is at once the most ordinary

and the most appropriate

and this i think is

the case with the word logic as applied to


 even those logicians who confine the science within the
narrowest limits though they avowedly exclude every thing
but ratiocination yet in their treatises definition method
c are touched upon although it be but slightly dr

whately as will be seen has as well as others a section on
each of these subjects

the extended sense above alluded to and to this

one therefore i should attach it√¢Äînot including

any application of the science to particular pur
poses√¢Äîbut merely the general abstract part of
it√¢Äîlike mathematics which treat only of such
general abstract properties of form and quantity
as are always the same whatever be the nature of

the subjectmatter if the above definition of
logic be not adopted i should propose the total
suppression of the word on account of its con
tinued misuse the general science might then
take the name of noology given to it by mr

bentham and the particular operation of rea
soning that of ratiocination to avoid the con
fusion of reasoning with reason this operation
would be subdivided into deduction or syllogistic
ratiocination and induction or

analogical

ratio

cination

a clearer idea may perhaps be obtained of
the extent of the field of logic or noology as i
have defined it by the following enumeration of
the several topics of which it may be said to
consist



 exposition of the object or endinview
viz the advantageous application of the human

mind to the study of any branch of artand
science



of

logic



 analysis of the subjectmatter viz the
human mind with the classification and descrip

tion of its several powers or faculties
 exposition of the means by which the
subjectmatter may be applied to the object
these are√¢Äî the transference of knowledge

comprehending on the one hand learning
on the other teaching either narrative or proba
tive to the exclusion of excitative communi
cation which belongs to rhetoric the im
provement of knowledge including selfteaching
 analysis of the operations performable
with relation to those means and rules for their

due performance these operations are ex
position in all its various modes methodization
including perhaps observation generalization
c induction deduction

 analysis of the instrument viz language
this includes the theory of universal grammhar
in as far as it relates to the process by which our
thoughts are expressed and the order and modes
in which such process is best suited to its object
in the hasty review of the several writers
ancient or modern who invented or have since

made any important changes in the system of

logic dr whately omits to mention any of the

definition of

logic

or editors of the

aristotelian

system in modern times but in the course of
the work it is to aldrich√¢Äôs compendium which he
commonly refers there is a work however by

bishop saunderson which was commonly in
use at oxford in the middle of the last century
and which appears to me to be superior to those
which have been more recently published
it contains indeed the usual superfluity of nomen
clature and of systematic ingenuity which charac
terizes the aristotelian syllogisms but upon
the whole it is drawn up in a comparatively

whatelys elements ch i p 

this chapter of dr whately√¢Äôs is a very useful

one to beginners by thus giving them a general
idea of the subjectmatter before the entering into
any details the author is enabled more readily
to point out as he goes on the use of those details
and their connection with the object in view as
however this has only reference to beginners
every rule and principle being repeated in the
synthetical compendium and as upon the
whole this part of the elements appears to

be well drawn up i consider it as need
less to enlarge upon the subject at present
but shall merely have to make a few observations
relating chiefly to some errors of detail which
though small in themselves may be productive
of much misconception in their results to these
observations i shall add as a necessary prelimi
nary to the science of logic a general classifica

and discourse

the author√¢Äôs remarks on the ambiguity of
words and on the very great degree in which it
may contribute to fallacy in argument as well as
in conception are generally speaking just and
appropriate but in some cases he has not been
very happy in clearing up this ambiguity he
adverts analytical outline p to that of the
words because and therefore which denote some
times the connection of premises and conclusion

a species of connection of logical subalternation
sometimes that of cause and effect

as an illus

tration he gives the example √¢Äúyonder is a fixed
star because it twinkles√¢Äù this is a good ex
ample of a connection of subalternation but

when he reverses it to this form √¢Äúit twinkles
because it is a fixed star√¢Äù he fails in giving an
instance of the relation of cause and effect a

star does not twinkle because it is fixed any
more than it is fixed because it twinkles

the

relation in this case as in the former is that of

logical subalternation exhibited in another form
this example is the more unhappily chosen as
no philosopher has as yet ascribed a plausible
cause for the twinkling of a star if he had

outline



said √¢Äúi no longer see the star because a cloud
is interposed between it and my eye√¢Äù this
would have been an apt illustration of the use of
because expressive of the connection between
cause and effect

and here i may advert to another kind ofinex
actness which frequently occurs though he has
expressly confined the first part of his work to de
duction or syllogistic reasoning he is continu
ally trespassing on the field of induction as in

this same page in the use of the word proof
here he plainly refers to inductive proof which
not producing certainty can scarcely be called
proof as well as to syllogistic the former
alone is applicable to future events or indeed
to any particular class of events the principle
that syllogisms are entirely independent of the
subjectmatter is one of those which he lays the
most stress upon throughout the book
of the whole system that part which he has
left the most confused and least intelligible is the
theory of the √¢Äúdistribution of the middle term √¢Äù
and that in a great measure from the illchosen
fiction made use of the word distribution it is
true is the one used by latin logicians for this

purpose and may in that language have been for

ought i know very appropriate but this is no
reason for transferring it to our language in that
sense when it already has acquired a totally dif
ferent one and that in very common use be
cause a figure is used in one language it does
not follow that it must be translated into another

by the same figure
the french

should we have to translate

expression

√¢Äúces hommes sont utiles

dans le rapport de leur puissance√¢Äù should we

say √¢Äúthese men are useful in the report of their
power√¢Äù or translate into french √¢Äúhe visited his
relations√¢Äù by the words √¢Äúil visitases relations√¢Äù
dr whately has undertaken to divest logic of all
those technicalities which have hitherto rendered

it so formidable to students as compared with its
use√¢Äîto render its study easy and its language
familiar for this purpose he has translated the

precepts and rules into our own language he
should also have translated the words and thereby
avoided the misconstructions that distribution
necessary particular c are liable to in the
cases where he uses them





distribution in english applies only to a
number of objects either physically placed into
compartments ready to receive them or ficti

tiously ranged under the several classes to which

outline

they belong



logicians call the distribution of

a term the saying that it is meant to be applied to a
whole class or to every object contained in a
class according to the sense in which you take

the word class and not to one part only of
the class when a man has had frequent occa
sion to use the word in its former sense what
time what labour what efforts does it not re

quire to accustom his mind to the latter one 

as for myself long as i have been acquainted
with this logical sense i own that it still puzzles
me on every occasion

would not the words universal and partial
answer the purpose they are not as appropriate
as one might wish but they are better at any rate
than distributed and nondistributed for at
least they convey no perplexing or erroneous
ideas √¢Äúa term is distributed√¢Äù says whately
√¢Äúwhen it is taken universally so as to stand for
every thing it is capable of being applied to√¢Äù and
consequently undistributed when it stands for a
portion only of the things applied to it here in
my opinion is as good a definition of universal

and partial as could easily be given substitute
these adjectives to the abovementioned parti

ciples wherever they occur and you will dissi
pate no small part of the confusion which still
predominates in this part of the elements
referring to p the words √¢Äúuniversal and
particular or partial√¢Äù are there applied in this
same sense to propositions and the being univer

sal or particular is called the quantity or extent
of these propositions i do not see why the same
locutions might not have been applied to the
terms also of a proposition and thus have obviated
the confusion above alluded to but here again i

cannot approve of the anglifying the latin words
instead of translating them dr whately him
self has perceived that extent is in this sense
the translation of quantitas and partial that of

particularis then why persist in saying quantity
and particular√¢Äîin speaking latin disguised
under an english mask rather than plain honest

intelligible english
some inaccuracy is also perceptible in the
syllogistic formula which he mentions here√¢Äîan
inaccuracy resulting from the confounding in
general the substantive with the adjective form

of the predicate and the not defining its extent
in the case of the former but as syllogisms are

considerations

we come to their detailed explanation
the remainder of this analytical outline
is devoted to the definition of the processes of
abstraction and generalization which are here
very aptly distinguished and to the very useful
exposure of the common error of ascribing real
ity to generic terms this should have been
carried still farther he should have exhibited

the pernicious effects resulting from the realiza
tion of those subjectmatters which d√¢Äôalembert

first called √£©tres fictifs and which mr bentham
has described under the name of fictitious en
tities he should have pointed out the constant
but unavoidable fiction which must enter into the
composition of any discourse and should have
given some indications by which error in this re

spect may be guarded against to give in as few
words as possible a general idea of mr ben
tham√¢Äôs view of the matter i must devote a few

pages to the general classification of entities
this subject does not strictly belong to the field

of logic but rather to that of ontology com
monly called metaphysics it is however
so important for the logical scholar to bear

in mind the leading principles upon which that
classification is founded that i have introduced

a chapter of considerable length on this subject
in the treatise on logic to which i have already
adverted

in that work the word entity and some of
its species being incidentally explained in the
course of the chapter on the mind and its opera
tions the general systematic expos√£© is deferred

till the end of the work as it there serves as
an exemplification of the rules of exposition
and methodization on the present occasion
i have thought it more advisable thus to intro

duce the subject at the outset as my object is
only to enable the reader to comprehend any

references i may have occasion to make to the
leading classes of entities
i have said that this classification is mr
bentham√¢Äôs and so it is with regard to the most

important heads but it had not been completed
by him several of the subdivisions and other

details have here been added and in many cases
i have thought it advisable with reference to the

present purpose to make some alterations in his
system

in other instances i have been obliged

to stop far short of the point to which he





outline

had carried the operation considering that
any further details would be irrelevant to the
present purpose

the word entity is that most extensive and
allcomprehensive term which is used to desig
nate every subjectmatter of perception thought
or discourse√¢Äîevery being every thing every

operation every property whether real abstract
or fictitious whether reckoned as certain con

tingent or impossible by any mind at any time
in any place every nounsubstantive every
substantive expression in any language is the

name of an entity
entity being therefore the most extensive


term that can be imagined it has no superior

genus and cannot be defined per genus et diffe
rentiam enumeration is the only mode by
which the word can be expounded and is the one
which i have attempted if the above enumera
tion be not allcomprehensive if there can be
imagined any one thing which be not compre
hended in it it is incomplete and consequently
the exposition incorrect

entities in general may be referred to the
 see hereafter modes of exposition ch vi



ch

iii

analytical

following classes or in other words the sum
mum genus entity may be divided as follows
i a real entity is one which has physical
existence that is one which is perceptible by
means of any of our senses as a rock a star a
man c a real entity must therefore be an
individual or a collection of individuals definite
in number as a landscape an army a man
on horseback c but if by these expressions
a particular class be meant they are no longer
names of real but of collective entities of which

mention will presently be made



ii an inferential entity is one which we
believe to have real existence but which is

imperceptible to any of our senses such is
in relation to every man the divinity he wor

ships such is our mind or the thinking part of
our frame





iii a fabulous entity is one which has
been believed in by others but to the existence
of which we attach no belief

such are with

relation to us the heathen gods which were
inferential entities with relation to those who
believed in them

between real or inferential

and fabulous entities there is no distinct line

of separation even with relation to one indi



outline



vidual mind as belief admits of every degree
from positive to negative certainty
iv a collective entity is the result of the
operations of abstraction and generalization

certain properties possessed by one entity or by
several entities in common are abstracted from

all other properties which those entities may
happen to possess and an indefinite number
of individuals are imagined as being all endowed
with those abstracted properties these indivi
duals form a class and are designated collec
tively by a common name
every common

name is therefore the name of a collective entity
√¢Äîof an indefinite number of individual entities

considered with respect of certain properties
common to all the entities so contained in the

class

where those entities are real the class

which contains them is a physical collective

entity where they are fictitious the corre
sponding collective entities are also fictitious

v a fictitious entity is one which neither

has nor is supposed to have any real existence
but which is grammatically spoken of as real

we say colour is a property benevolence is
a quality and yet we do not suppose that

colour property benevolence or quality are
d



ch

analytical

really existing objects these four words are
therefore names of fictitious entities
fictitious entities as well as real are refer

rible to classes which classes may be termed

collective

fictitious entities

fictitious entities

are individualized by referring them to real
objects as for example the colour of that
object that man√¢Äôs benevolence
as to the subdivision of these several heads


it is only in regard to real and to fictitious
entities that it appears to be necessary on the
present occasion
in the case of real entities the summum

genus is commonly designated by the word
matter which may be divided into bodies and
substances according to whether the individuals
referred to are or are not for the particular pur
pose in view supposed to be limited in configu
ration thus man tree house c are names
of classes of bodies√¢Äîmetal bone flesh c
are names of classes of substances

these two genera bodies and substances are
susceptible of regular and distinctlycharacterized
divisions and subdivisions which may always be
rendered allcomprehensive that is such as that
when taken together they shall comprehend

outline



every conceivable real entity such an operation
however is foreign to the present purpose being
the subjectmatter of physical science

but fictitious entities can by no means be so
easily reduced to order

the vague and indefi

nite nature of the operation of fiction renders
the classification of its results a very arduous
task in the following sketch i have endea
voured to refer them to a few general heads but
such is the difficulty of bringing them under all
comprehensive genera and species that in some
instances it will be found that the lowest species
here mentioned must for the purpose of exposi
tion or ulterior division be considered as summa
genera

i physical fictitious entities are such as
relate to real individuals

a real individual may be considered as being
either in motion or at rest

thence the division

of physical fictitious entities into motions and

states of things physical actions and opera
tions are species of motions more or less com
plicated
 such are for example some of the jurisprudential ficti
tious entities here classed under the head of immediate
results of political operations
d 



ch

i ii

analytical

states of things or properties may be divided
into absolute and relative the absolute pro
perties of a body are such as have place inde

pendently of any other body and consist in the
effect which that body produces upon our mind

the relative properties of a body are such
as result from its comparison with another body
the summum genus of absolute properties
is existence its division may be founded on
various principles or sources thus for exam
ple we may divide existence
 according to the degree of belief attached

to it into certainty contingency in its various
degrees impossibility c

 all the substantives given as examples under this head of
states of things or properties are to be reckoned as names
of properties some of them are commonly used in other
senses also as for example organization which means either

the operation of organizing or the property of being organized
it is in the latter sense that it is here to be understood

this is an imperfection in language much to be regretted but
which i fear cannot be easily remedied
there are in fact but few instances comparatively speak
ing where there is a substantive in use for the designation of

properties and on many occasions it might not even be
desirable to make use of it should it exist thus the adjec
tive is a very common and a very useful abridged form as for

of

perceptibility

sence that is the being within or without the
reach of any of our senses in respect either
of place or of time or of both absence in

respect of place may be subdivided into attain
ability the property of being susceptible of
becoming within reach unattainability c

a corresponding division of absence in

respect

of time is into past and future

of which the properties are perceived thus√¢Äì

is endowed with redness a species of absolute properties if
we say that it is large we refer to largeness a species of rela

tive properties sometimes properties are designated in the
verbal form as for example he can move by this expression
is understood that he is endowed with that species of absolute
properties which cannot be substantively expressed otherwise
than by some such hard word as locomoveability the words
before behind above belon are examples of relative properties
expressed in the adverbial form that language is the most
convenient for use in this respect which enables the writer to
choose on each occasion that form of expression which is
best suited to his particular purpose

of distance

these relations may also be subdi

vided into inherence exclusion the properties of

 relations of simultaneity and succession in


 by inherence it is understood that one body is a part of

 the relative properties of the mind such
as intensity of its faculties sanity and insanity of

ethical fictitious entities

means of these faculties which operations are
also exemplified in the course of the following

operations viz impressions and ideas with

pains and neutral sensations pleasures and
pains have been subdivided into fourteen heads

late to desire and will that is to the desiring
and volitional mind these may be classed
mnder the following heads



out line

 properties of the desiring mind or desire
and its species with relation to any event or

object desire may be divided into positive desire
or hope and negative desire or fear and either
of these may be subdivided according to its object

thus hunger thirst ambition curiosity c
are species of desire distinguished by their re

spective objects viz solid food liquid food
social preeminence acquirement of know
ledge c

 motives for ethical operations a species
of entities intimately

connected with the preced

ing but which are distinguished by the ad
ditional intimation of the relation they bear to
operations
 ethical operations which are either moral




such as approbation vituperation entreaty
refusal c or political such as command
empowerment obligation punishment c
 immediate results of ethical operations
such are with relation to moral operations
neutral laudatory and vituperative qualifica
tions of fictitious entities viz reputation virtue
√¢Ä¢ by these words must be understood on the present occa
sion the operations of approving blaming entreating refus
ing√¢Äîcommanding empowering obliging punishing c

not any results or effects of those operations

a nalytical

and vice with all their several species with
relation to political operations command obli
gation right power c

 ethical relations such are society and
conditions in life moral or political

moral

conditions are those of friendship inimity c
political conditions are trades professions
situations places offices c
this last head comes very near to that of
physical relations it differs in this that it is not
by the perceptive but by the conceptive faculty
that they are attached to the idea of the persons
to which they relate
a barrister for ex is
not perceptibly different from a solicitor like a
tall man from a short one barristership and

solicitorship are ethical fictitious entities tallness
and shortness are physical fictitious entities

dissertation on the province of reasoning
operations of the mind whatelys

elements ch ii part i √¢ß p their enu
meration in as far as they relate to argumenta
tion opens the synthetical compendium on
this occasion i must quote the author√¢Äôs words

√¢Äúthere are three√¢Äù meaning of course only
three √¢Äúoperations of the mind which are con

cerned in argument st simple apprehension
d judgment d discourse or reasoning√¢Äù
and in a note he says √¢Äúlogical writers have in
general begun by laying down that there are
in all three operations of the mind in universum
tres an assertion by no means incontroverti


faculties



ble√¢Äù as will be shortly seen √¢Äúand which if
admitted is nothing to the present purpose our
business is with argumentation and the opera
tions of the mind implied in that what others
there may be or whether any are irrelevant ques
tions√¢Äù



as to this assertion i cannot exactly concur
in the author√¢Äôs opinion in the first place i
should think that even argumentation cannot be
carried on without making use of all the simple
faculties of the mind that attention memory

and abstraction to go no farther are equally
necessary with the three which he enumerates
and secondly i have already stated that i do
not consider argumentation alone as constituting
the science of logic but that i also include ex

position methodization and other intellectual
operations

for these purposes it is necessary to

be acquainted in as far as possible with all the
powers or faculties of the intellectual mind
in the same note the author proceeds to say
√¢Äúthe opening of a treatise with a statement
respecting the operations of the mind universally
tends to foster the prevailing error from which
probably the minds of the writers were not
exempt of supposing that logic professes to



ch iv

intellectual

teach √¢Äúthe use of the mental faculties in general√¢Äù

√¢Äì the right use of reason according to watts√¢Äù
in one sense of the word i fear that i must

admit that my mind is √¢Äúnot exempt from this

prevailing error√¢Äù for i certainly suppose that
logic teaches the √¢Äúuse of the mental faculties

in general√¢Äù√¢Äîthat is so much of their use as
is applicable to any branch of artandscience
whatever may be its subjectmatter by this

limitation i hope to avoid the threatened danger
of √¢Äúintruding into the province of natural phi
losophy√¢Äù when logical principles are once
generally laid down they may indeed afterwards
be applied to any one artandscience√¢Äîto ethics
to physiology or to any other but it is this

application not the general theory that has been
improperly ascribed to logic in the same manner
as if the application of mathematics to astronomy
were considered as belonging to mathematics
not to astronomy
 i shall now proceed therefore to the enumera

tion of the intellectual faculties founded on the
general view given by mr bentham in chresto
mathia p essai c p with some
few alterations suggested by a closer investigation
of the subject and in order to establish the

faculties



precise distinction between the intellectual and
volitional faculties i must first extract from mr

bentham√¢Äôs mss a summary view of the human
faculties in general

by human faculties i mean all those proper
ties which are either the result or the character

istics of human life√¢Äîthe result if by life we
understand the cause of the phenomena that take
place in the human frame√¢Äîthe characteristics if
life be taken for the aggregate of those pheno
inena

these faculties are either physical or psychi
cal the physical are those of which the action
is perceptible by our senses that is which take

place in our body the psychical those which
take place in our mind taking this word in its
most extensive sense and of which therefore
the action is imperceptible to our senses the
study of the nature and operation of the physical
faculties of the human frame belongs to that por
tion of zoology which relates to man

the psychical faculties may be divided into
original and derivative
the original psychical faculties are desire and
will these are denominated original because it
is their successive operation that produces that of
e



ch

iv

intellectual

the derivative faculties whether bodily or mental

the ethical sciences moral and political relate
entirely to the nature and operation of these two
faculties

the derivative psychical faculties may be
considered as either active or passive

the

active as well as the passive when unconnected
with any idea of pleasure or pain are usually

comprehended under the name of intellectual
faculties and constitute that which is generally
denominated the mind or more properly intel
lect when mind is taken in the more extended
sense i have formerly alluded to these faculties
alone belong to the province of logic the

passive faculties or sensations when connected
with pleasures and pains appertain to mental
pathology

the following enumeration of intellectual
faculties may perhaps be yet incomplete the
analysis of what passes within ourselves is so
difficult an operation that i fear much that some
of the more simple ones may not be found suffi
ciently distinct and as to the more complicated
ones new combinations might very possibly be
made and corresponding faculties might be
added to this list

those however which i

faculties



have here inserted appear to me to be all that
are brought into practical use

the intellectual faculties i have said are
either passive or active
i the passive faculties are

 perceptionas communicated to the mind
by the immediate operation of the senses or of

physical faculties the result of perception is an
impression that of the operation of any other
intellectual faculty is an idea
the difference between an impression and an
idea may be illustrated by the following example
place an object before your eyes as long as you

see it you have an impression of it take your
eyes off it there remains in your mind the idea
only of that object
 conception√¢Äîdiffering from perception in
this that it is communicated to the mind by theim

mediate operation of intellectual not of physical

faculties if i see a horse ireceive an impression
of it by means of the perceptive faculty if the
word horse be mentioned to me i entertain a cor

responding idea by means of the conceptive
faculty suppose i read the word horse in a

book i perceive so many black marks i conceive
the idea of a horse perception is applicable

only to real individual entities conception is un
limited in its field it is applicable to any entities
of any class whatsoever
conception is designated by dr whately in
imitation again of the latin by the name of sim

ple apprehension

he had better have adopted

that of conception which he inserts in a parenthe
sis by way of explanation apprehension in
england is usually expressive of fear but con

ception is more generally used in the sense here
given to it
the division of simple apprehension into

complew and incomplex does not appear to be in
strict conformity to the rules of logical division

what does simple mean if it be not synonymous to
incomplex and in that case what is to be under
stood by dividing that which is simple into that

which is and that which is not simple the fact
is that every conception of any really existing
object is complex that of a man just as much as
of a man on horseback for each of these is com

posed of a great number of simple conceptions

a simple conception is that of a single property
that of a colour for instance without those of
form of extent or any other it is the result of

an operation of the abstractive faculty

fa culties



has not the author of the elements in this in
stance been led astray by words does he not con
sider as simplean ideaexpressed by a single word
and as complex one which is expressed by several
words for i see no other distinction in point of
complexity between the idea √¢Äúcards√¢Äù and √¢Äúa
pack of cards√¢Äù √¢Äúman√¢Äù √¢Äúhorse√¢Äù and √¢Äúman
on horseback√¢Äù

in order to entertain the idea

√¢Äúcards√¢Äù in the plural we must conceive a
certain number placed in a certain relative

situationa bundle or a heap or some such
collection of cards and is either of these less

complex than a √¢Äúpack of cards√¢Äù in like man
ner as a man on horseback is composed of two
separate individual objects placed in a certain
relative situation so is a man composed of a head
neck body and limbs all of them separate
individual objects placed also in a certain rela
tive situation

 passive memory√¢Äìclosely allied with ac
tive retention to this head may be ascribed

the faculty of mental habit habitude of french
logicians more or less of which is displayed
in dreams involuntary thought c

the deno

minations by which they are here designated are

intellectual

universally the names of the corresponding ope

rations for our language does not afford single
worded substantive appellations for the faculties

themselves when occasion may require that
they be distinguished from the operations it may

be done by changing the termination tion into

that of tive and by adding the word faculty

as

for example abstraction√¢Äîabstractive faculty
 attention√¢Äîthe giving force and duration
to the exercise of any one or more of the other
intellectual faculties



 retention if this be distinct from passive
memory it may perhaps be the combination of
that faculty with attention
 judgment this word must not be here
understood in the sense in which dr whately
makes use of it his operation of judgment is
what is here denominated comparison at least
the first part of it viz √¢Äúthe comparing together
in the mind two of the notions or ideas which

are the objects of apprehension√¢Äù the pro

nouncing that they agree or disagree is indeed
one occasion on which the judicative faculty is
called into exercise but it is only one judg
ment usually pronounces either the degree of

belief attached by our intellectual mind to

facult i es





or the degree of pleasure or pain produced in
our sensitive mind by√¢Äìan impression or an idea
it is an instantaneous operation which accompa
nies and forms part of that of every other

intellectual faculty

it is affirmative negative

or contingent each operation of this faculty if
expressed is a proposition the portion of lan
guage by means of which it is expressed is a
sentence

 comparison√¢Äîis the alternate application of
attention to two separate impressions or ideas
with a view to pronouncing a judgment upon the
several relations which they may bear to one
anotherrelations for instance of identity and
diversity in time place or state or as to depen
dence of cause and effect or of logical subalter
nation c c these several relations have been
further detailed in the general classification of

entities at the end of ch iii of this outline
 deduction√¢Äîthe deducing a proposition
from two others√¢Äîa conclusion from two premises
this is what logicians designate by the term

reasoning or more correctly by that of argu
mentative or syllogistic reasoning the expression
of the operation at full length and in a regular
form being termed a syllogism



cii iv

intellectual

dr whately√¢Äôs definition of reasoning upon
this occasion does not appear to me either cor
rect or conformable to those which he gives else
where

here he speaks but of one premiss√¢Äî

√¢Äúreasoning or discourse is the act of proceed
ing from one judgment to another founded upon
it or the result of it√¢Äù this may be applicable
to his conversion of propositions which i have
termed √¢Äúa deductive operation consisting of two

propositions only√¢Äù but certainly not to his
syllogism as defined p and the addition
in the form of a synonym to reasoning of the
word discourse only tends to confuse the mind
as it refers to an operation totally different this

is another instance of devotion to anglolatin
words in preference to plain english
 abstraction√¢Äîthe isolating a simple idea
from all others connected with it√¢Äîthe consider

ing separately a single property possessed by one
or more entities to the exclusion of any others
which those entities may happen to possess
thus the idea redness for instance is the result

of an operation of the abstractive faculty

the

property of being red is separated from all other
 elements p 



faculties

properties possessed at the same time by the
several red bodies that have come within reach

of our perception the object of this operation
is the formation of new aggregates by means
either of the generalizing or of the synthetical
faculties

 generalization√¢Äîhas place when after
having abstracted one or more properties com
mon to several individuals we suppose an in
definite number of individuals endowed with the

same properties and give to them a common
name that is a name applicable to any or all
such individuals in respect of the possession of
such abstracted properties
the two latter operations of abstraction and
generalization are well explained by dr whately
pp et seq pp et seq c yet he has
omitted them on the present occasion in speak
ing of the √¢Äúoperations of the mind concerned
in argument√¢Äù
 synthesis√¢Äîthe combining several indi


 the words synthesis and combination and their converse
analysis and division are used for the designation of three dis
tinct operations physical or real combination and di
vision which is either mechanical or chemical

 mental

combination and division that is the supposing or imagining



ch iv

intellectual

vidual ideas or impressions simple or compli
cated into one definite individual idea for ex
the calling london the combination of houses
streets c which constitute that town

this is probably what dr whately under
stands by √¢Äúcomplex simple apprehension√¢Äù in his
example of a √¢Äúman on horseback√¢Äù the man and
the horse two separate individual though com
plicated ideas are combined into one individual
idea a √¢Äúman on horseback√¢Äù by a synthetical
operation
 division logical√¢Äîthe converse of gene
ralization from a general class constituted by
the combination of any number of properties the
forming subclasses by the additional considera
tion of other properties applicable only to a part
oftheindividuals to which the general classinques
tion refers thus the class animal having been
founded on the consideration of the property
of animation by the additional consideration of

the property of rationality we form the two sub

two real objects to be combined mechanically or chemically
it is to these operations that i have applied the denominations
synthesis and analysis logical or subalternate com
bination and division which are above designated by the
words generalization and logical division

faculties



classes of man√¢Äîconsisting of those animals which
are possessed of that property and of brutes√¢Äîor
those which are deprived of it these subclasses
are called parts of the general class because they
refer to a part only of the individuals referred to
by that general class yet in both cases the in
dividuals are indefinite in number that is in a

number greater than our mind can conceive
for a fuller investigation of this operation see
ch vii methodization

 analysis√¢Äîthe converse of synthesis it
operates on individual ideas in the same manner
that logical division does on classes man for
ex may be divided logically into negroes and
whites a man may be analyzed mentally as

well as physically into his head neck body
and limbs

 simple imagination√¢Äîthe forming by the
mental combination of abstracted properties an
image analogous to the impression that would
have been created by the perception of such

properties were they really so combined thus
when we are told that √¢Äúa quadruped is an
animal with four legs√¢Äù in order to fix this idea
in our mind we immediately refer it to some

imaginary individual to which we consequently



ch

iv

in it ellectual

ascribe a number of properties not contained in
the idea of √¢Äúan animal with four legs√¢Äù these
imaginary properties may perhaps belong in fact
to some real individual contained in the class but

the images will much more frequently be vague
or incorrect as for ex when we have heard
much mention made of a man whom we have

never seen we figure to ourselves his person and
features and how often are we not surprised
when afterwards we really meet with him to
find his appearance totally different from the
image we had formed of him it is in order to
obviate erroneous images that we seek to give
correct and exact ones by description a mode of
exposition which will be treated of in ch vi

 observation√¢Äîthe combined operation of
the perceptive retentive judicative and attentive

faculties applied to the recurrence of the same
phenomena or relations of things in various
analogous instances and commonly directed to
the accomplishment of some particular end
observation must not be confounded with ex

periment which is a physical operation per
formed for the purpose and with a view to ob
servation and therefore preceding it
 induction after we have by observa



faculties

tion or by evidence ascertained the recurrence
of phenomena or relations of things in some in
stances we pronounce that the same phenomena
or relation of things have recurred do or will re
cur in some other instance which we judge to be
analogous in the same degree this operation is
called induction it seldom produces absolute
belief in all minds but merely a greater or lesser

degree of contingent belief according to the state
of the mind that is to its confidence either in

the veracity of the observation or evidence or in

the constancy of recurrence of those phenomena
in those instances

see ch x

induction

expectation appears to be the immediate
result of the exercise of the judicative faculty on
an inductive operation of which the conclusion

relates to futurity it can scarcely be classed
however as an intellectual faculty
 methodization√¢Äîthe arranging the seve

 when we speak of arranging ideas in the mind it is not
meant that these ideas are real objects actually placed in dif

ferent parts of the brain but that we imagine them that is
their signs or nords to be so arranged either on paper or
elsewhere√¢Äîto be placed above below or by the side of one
anotherthose which are most similar with reference to the

particular object in view being supposed to be nearest to



ch iv

intellectual

ral impressions or ideas produced by the exercise
of any one or more of our intellectual faculties
in a certain order with a view to facilitate any

subsequent operation of any of those same facul
ties distribution and collocation are species of
methodization some farther details upon these
operations with the accessory ones of generaliza
tion division synthesis analysis and observa
tion will be found in ch vii methodization
 invention√¢Äîthe combining ideas in a man

ner that has not yet been done and with a view
to the attainment of some particular end

 communication√¢Äîthe communicating an
idea to another person is the causing his mind
to conceive and to entertain that same idea com

munication includes exposition the subject of
ch wi of this outline

this last faculty of communication may ap
pear at first sight to be semiphysical as it
gether in the arrangementor those which follow one another
in the order of thought being placed after one another in the
supposed physical order
it must be observed that the word methodization is here




used in a more limited sense than that which is attributed to

it hereafter but it would be difficult to find a synonymous
word which is not liable to the same inconvenience

facult es



requires the aid of the physical faculties of speak
ing or writing to bring into exercise but in as
far as it is mental it appertains to logic and
claims a place in this enumeration besides
that if any one of the others be closely exa
mined into it will be found that few if any can
be made use of without the assistance of those

signs which are furnished by language
in the above list i have endeavoured to place
the faculties in the order of their complexity the
latter ones consisting chiefly of combinations
of some of the preceding and more simple ones
it would not be a very easy task to arrange them

systematically in distinct classes there might
however be some use in referring them generally

these several faculties would require much

the field of logic

chapter v

on terms

whatelys elements ch ii part i √¢ß p 

sections and of this part of the ele
ments are devoted by the author to the exposition

of language and its several component parts
√¢Äúlanguage√¢Äù he says √¢Äúaffords the signs by
which these operations of the mind are expressed
and communicated an act of apprehension

expressed in language is called a term an act of
judgment a proposition an act of reasoning an
argument which when regularly expressed is a
syllogism√¢Äù


the enumeration of the intellectual faculties

being no longer confined to that of the three
which are here mentioned and the sense of the

denominations given to these three faculties
having been much modified in my preceding

chapter correspondent alterations are requisite
in the above exposition
 simple apprehension judgment and reasoning see the
preceding chapter 



ch v

on

language i should say is the aggregate of
the signs by which any mental operation is ex
pressed or communicated an impression or an
idea when expressed in language is a term an

operation of the judicative faculty a proposi
tion that of the ratiocinative faculty an argu
ment that of the deductive faculty a syllogism
with regard to the remainder of these two
sections of the elements i have but one observa

tion to make the author says that in a propo

sition for the purpose of deduction an adjective
cannot be made the subject but may be employed
as a predicate the inconveniences arising from
expressing the predicate in an adjective form will
be exhibited in the chapter on deduction and
there it may perhaps be shown that this is not
absolutely √¢Äúa question of no practical conse
quence√¢Äù



the next section relates to genus differ

ence and properties which are thus defined
√¢Äúwhatever term can be affirmed of several

things must express either their whole essence

which is called the species or a part of their es
sence viz either the material part which is
 elements p 


terms



called the genus or the formal and distinguishing
part which is called the differentia or in com
mon discourse characteristic or something

joined to the essence whether necessarily ie to
the whole species or in other words universally
to every individual of it which is called a pro
perty or contingently i e to some individual
only of the species which is an accident√¢Äù
there appears to be some confusion in this

paragraph in which again the meaning of en
glish words is perverted in order to make them
conformable to the latin

the differentia or

characteristic is a species of property not distinct
from it it is exactly that which belongs necessa

rily to an entity√¢Äînecessarily in the ordinary
sense of the word though in the sense here given

to it which is that of universally this may not be
the case if we are assured that a property is
universal it becomes essential and characteristic
if we are not assured of this universality we
cannot consider the property as essential though

it may happen to be universal and as long as we
know of nothing to the contrary we may speak
of it as such

i should therefore say that whatever term

can be affirmed of another is either a synonymous
f 



ch

v

on

term or it is expressive either of the class or ge

nus to which the subject belongs or of a property
which appertains to this subject this property
is either essential or characteristic that is with
out which the subject would not be what it is said
to be or accidental that is such as may or may

not belong to all the individuals referred to by the
subject





suppose man to be the subject√¢Äîthe predicate
animal is its genus rational its essential property

or difference the properties of having a white skin
or ten fingers c are accidental though in
different degrees of contingency

that of hav

ing ten fingers for instance amounts almost to
what we should call an universal property yet it

is not essential

for if a man had but nine he

would still be a man

the accidental and essential properties may

be easily distinguished by applying to them the
following

question

an entity which has not the

property in question is it or is it not thereby
excluded from the subject in question if it be
so excluded the property is essential if not it is
accidental



logically speaking every class is a genus
when compared to its subclasses or to the indivi




terms

duals to which it refers it is also a species when
compared with the more general aggregates in
which it is contained thus when we say
√¢Äúwhat is caesar√¢Äù answer √¢Äúa man√¢Äù we

predicate the genus of casar in the same man
ner as when we say √¢Äúwhat is man√¢Äù answer

√¢Äúan animal√¢Äù we predicate the genus of man
as to predicating the √¢Äúwhole essence√¢Äù of a
subject in one term that is impossible unless
that term be a strict synonym drwhately does
not appear to have been aware of this he im
plies that if we predicate the genus we predicate
a part of the essence if the species we predicate
the whole essence considering species in the
sense in which naturalists employ the word in

which case it is in fact a logical genus with refer
ence to individuals √¢Äúif i predicate√¢Äù says hef √¢Äúof
caesar that he is an animal i say the truth indeed
but not the whole truth for he is not only an
animal but a man√¢Äù but this is not yet the
whole truth for he is not only a man but a

white man not only a white man but a roman
and so on till we come to the individual caesar

ments p of summa genera or genera
generalissima properly so called there is but
one viz entity yet as it may have been seen
in the classification of entities there is a conveni

ence in considering as summa genera several
ethical and other terms but it is a great mis
take in logicians to suppose that there is such a

thing as an infima species that is one which con
tains under it nothing but individuals the num
ber of individuals contained in a logical aggregate
is always indefinite when a class therefore is
divided and subdivided each part refers also to

an indefinite number of individuals√¢Äîthe very
property of infinity is that it cannot be so
divided as to be reduced to √¢Äúnothing but indi

viduals√¢Äù for then these individuals would be
no longer indefinite in number

√¢Äúmagnet√¢Äù

says dr whately √¢Äúis an infima species i e
only a species√¢Äù what is meant by the ex
planation √¢Äúonly a species√¢Äù is more than i can

make out assuredly this is not the translation of
infima species but let us take these latin



terms

words in their real sense viz √¢Äúa species of

the lowest degree√¢Äù it may be allowed that no
two individual magnets are exactly alike in every
respect

suppose one to be square another

round there may well be imagined an indefinite
number both of square and of round magnets
here are then two subspecies of an infima

species two species below the lowest and so it

may happen in any case
with respect however to each particular
subjectmatter of classification there may be a
eonvenience in considering the whole aggregate
of that subjectmatter as a summum genus and
any class of the last degree to which it is ad

visable to carry the subalternate division as an
infima species

but this can

only be said

rela

tively to that particular system not generally as
it is here asserted

as to the particular sense in

which naturalists make use of the word species
it is very different from the logical sense of the
word the only one in which it should be made
use of on the present occasion
the great labour spent on the distinction be


tween differentia and property p might have
been spared if it had been considered that the



ch

one is but a species of the other the author
himself has on a subsequent occasion made
use of the word property in that general sense
which must include essential as well as accidental

properties

accidents that is accidental properties are
next divided into separable and inseparable a
division which may not perhaps be found to be
in strict conformity to the standard rule √¢Äúmem

exposition

exposition is a name which may be applied
to the designation of every operation destined to

enable the learner to attach to the word or sen
tence expounded an idea precisely the same as

that which is attached to it by the teacher
any portion of discourse may be unintelli
gible to him to whom it is directed either by
conveying to his mind no idea at all or by con

veying to it a confused incomplete or errone
oust idea the object of exposition is there
fore either to attach an idea to a word or to give
clearness completeness or correctnesst to an
idea already attached to it exposition is that
which logicians call definition taken in the

most extensive sense of the word expounding
a word may be also termed explaining the idea
attached to that word

in the following enumeration of the different
modes or species of exposition the order at

tempted to be adopted is that in which they
 the word learner is here made use of to designate him to
whom discourse is addressed and teacher him who makes use
of such discourse







 by a correct idea is meant upon this occasion the idea
which was intended to be conveyed by an erroneous idea
one which was not intended to be conveyed



ch

would present themselves for use commencing 
with that which must be resorted to in the case

where the learner is entirely ignorant of any

word comprised either in the language to be
taught or in any other language known to the
teacher

 physical designation in the abovemen
tioned case this is the only mode of exposition
that can at first be used

it consists in the

designating objects by signs as by pointing to
real objects by performing perceptible operations
c and at the same time pronouncing the name
to be given to those objects this name being the
word to be expounded thus may be formed
though with much labour and little accuracy the

rude outline of a language consisting in the first
place of proper names only in process of time
a few common names adjectives verbs and other
expletives may be added so as to allow the use of

any of the following modes which may be termed
logical or discoursual modes of exposition in

contradistinction to this physical or nondiscour
sual mode

 translation√¢Äîthe expounding a locution by

the exhibition of a synonymous locution already
known to the reader that is one which already



exposition

conveys to his mind the idea intended to be
attached to the locution expounded
this mode is applicable either to the case
where the object is to instruct the learner in a
language unknown to him or where it is to teach
him in the same language synonymous terms

either because they have been made use of by au
thors whom he may have occasion to refer to or
because the new term may be more convenient for

some particular use the expressions √¢Äúhombre
is the spanish for man√¢Äù √¢Äúthe peduncle is the
botanical name for a flower stalk√¢Äù are examples
of exposition by translation
 etymologization√¢Äîthe exposition of a

word by the exhibition of the grammatical rela
tion it bears to another word called its
from whence it is said to be derived

root

and

grammati

cal relations have place whenever it has been
found convenient to express by regular modifica

tions in the form of a word any regular relations
in the sense of two words such as of time sex
number c the relation between the operator
and the operation between a property and its
subjectmatter c as for ex governor go
verness actor actress write wrote c the

exposition of a word by the exhibition of its



ch

vi

root may be on some occasions attended with
considerable clearness and conciseness but this

mode is in general liable to fallacy that is to
erroneous and deceptive exposition as will be
shown in ch xi on fallacies under the head

of fallacies of paronymity and of etymology
the root and the word derived being collectively

designated by the name of paronymous words
the two preceding modes are comprehended
by logicians under the denomination of nominal

definitions which they distinguish from real by
saying that the former explain the meaning of the
term the latter the nature of the thing dr
whately observes that in most cases √¢Äúthe
meaning of the word and the nature of the thing
are exactly the same√¢Äù he might have said in all
cases

yet there does exist a difference between

the two modes in question and those which will
follow a difference which drwhately had proba

bly in view but has not succeeded in explaining
to his readers

it consists in this that in what

may still perhaps be termed nominal exposition

the meaning of the word or nature of the thing
is represented at once by means of a single term

already known to the learner

in the real ex

 it must be remembered that the word real is here op



exposition

position the operation is performed by the com
bination of a number of terms expressive of ideas
different from that which is explained thus it

may be said that in nominal exposition words
only are considered in real exposition the ideas
also connected with the words

 definition√¢Äîthe exhibition of the genus
to which a collective idea belongs and of the
properties which distinguish it from all other spe
cies of the same genus this is that mode which
aristotelians term √¢Äúdefinitio per genus et diffe
rentiam√¢Äù and which dr whately has denomi
nated √¢Äúessential definition√¢Äù it is applicable
only to common names and when practicable is
the most exact of all modes of exposition ex
homo est animal rationale

the characteristic

phrases of naturalists are all definitions
 individuation√¢Äîthe corresponding opera
tion performed on the name of an individual
viz the exhibition of its genus and characteristic

properties this mode differs from definition
because in this case the only characteristic pro

perties are those of time and place which must
both be exhibited no other properties nor yet
posed to verbal a sense different from that in which i have
used it on other occasions where it is opposed to fictitious





ch

vi

one of these without the other can ever distin

guish an individual from all others which may
exist or can be conceived to exist as time and

place are constantly varying exposition by indivi
duation alone can never enable the learner to

recognize the individual whose name is thus ex
pounded definition on the contrary affords
him the means of pronouncing on all occasions
whether an individual belongs or not to the genus
of which the name is defined


examples of individuation john is the man
who is sitting in that chair louis xviii is the
man who was king of france at the time you
were at paris



 paraphrasis the exposition by paraphra

sis of a fictitious entity is the combining the
word in question with others so as to make up

a complete proposition and then translating that
proposition into an equivalent one composed of
names of either real or physical fictitious entities
these two successive operations may be denomi

nated phraseoplerosis and equivalence the fol

lowing examples are expositions by paraphrasis
of the words obligation and right

√¢Äúa man

 see the classification of entities at the end of ch iii

exposition



being under an obligation to do a thing means
that he is liable to punishment if he does not

do it√¢Äù √¢Äúa man having a right to do a thing
means that any other person who prevents him

from doing it is liable to punishment for so pre
venting him√¢Äù
this mode is applicable only to names of fic
titious entities and amongst those it is for the
exposition of such as may be considered as sum
ma genera that it is particularly appropriate and
indeed the only practicable mode
 archetypation this is the exposition of
the name of a fictitious entity by the exhibition of

the name of the physical entity or archetype
upon which the imagination of the fictitious
entity in question has been grounded take for
example the two following expositions of the
term endinview

√¢Äúthe endinview bears the same relation to a

mental operation that a physical end or place
which it is wished a body in motion should

arrive at bears to the motion of that body√¢Äù
√¢Äúthe idea of endinview applied to a mental

operation is derived from that of the end which
is the object of a body in motion as for instance
the winningpost in a racecourse√¢Äù

 description is a detailed exposition of ac
cidental properties that is of those of which the

an indefinite degree suppose for example a
quadruped to be defined √¢Äúanimal mammifer

add the properties of living out of water having

water or possessing wings this animal would
still be a quadruped
such is specific description or description ap
plied to logical aggregates or collective entities
the object of description is in this case either to
enable the learner to recognize a species with
greater readiness or to furnish his mind with an
image such as may fix the collective entity in his

mind by recognizing a species must be under
stood the being enabled to say whether any indi
vidual that may come within reach of our percep
tion does or does not belong to such species



exposition

definition is the only mode that can enable us
to determine this with positive certainty but the

characteristic properties which alone are exhi

bited by definition are frequently difficult to per
ceive description in these cases furnishes us
with more striking properties though less univer
sal recognition becomes more ready but less ac
curate description should therefore be always
accompanied or rather preceded by definition
the importance of this rule has been felt in the
case of naturalists√¢Äô descriptions for instance
where the characteristic phrase which is a defini
tion per genus et differentiam always precedes
the detailed description
it has been said in speaking of the imagina
tive faculty that our mind in order to retain any


physical idea presented to it must form to itself
an image

consisting

of more properties than

those given by the definition one object of

specific description is to furnish the imagination
with such properties as are actually possessed by
some at least of the individuals referred to and

perhaps by all which is better than if the image
were formed of such as were never possessed by
any of them

individual description or description applied
g 



ch vi

to individuals is of still more importance for
though liable to the same uncertainties and in
accuracies as specific description it is the only
one that can serve for physical recognition as
the properties exhibited by individuation viz
those of time and place are continually chang
ing portraits personal descriptions in pass
ports particulars of sale of estates c are ex
amples of individual description
 parallelism including antithesis√¢Äîthis
may be considered as a species or at any rate as
a slight modification of description it is appli
cable to the case where an entity is essentially
distinguished from another by minute or difficult
characters that is characters which it is difficult
to perceive or to comprehend by parallelism
in this case the two objects are compared with
respect to other properties than those given in the
definition

relations of similitude and dissimili

tude between the two objects in question are
thus pointed out in as much as similitude is
exhibited the operation receives more especially
the name of parallelism when it is dissimilitude
and more particularly opposition that is ex
hibited the operation is termed antithesis
 enumeration√¢Äîconsidered as a mode of

exposition



expositionis the successive exhibition of all the
minor aggregates comprehended in a superordi
nate genus or of all the several individuals com

prehended in a synthetical entity that is to say
of the several parts of an individual the super

ordinate genus and the synthetical entity being
in these cases the entity to be explained hence
the division of enumeration into specific and in
dividual enumeration according to whether it be

applied to a genus or to a synthetical entity
enumeration can only serve for exposition
in as much as it is complete when incomplete
it is mere exemplification hence it is that
specific enumeration is seldom accurate for
if you expound the name of the genus equus

by saying that it consists of the four species
horse ass zebra and couagga you do not give
an accurate idea of it for there may be other spe
cies hitherto unknown belonging to the same
genus enumeration in this case can only be com

plete when the species are formed by the contra
dictorily bifurcate system hereafter explained
individual enumeration is exemplified in the
case of catalogues c

ch vi

if exposition be considered with respect to its

immediate object it may be divided into ono
matopaea or the giving a new name to an idea
and into exposition of existing words
in following the same principle of division

exposition of existing words may be subdivided
into the following operations√¢Äî



 substitution of a new sense to the one in

which a word has already been used an opera
tion resembling onomatopoea but attended with
much more practical inconvenience excepting

where the use of the word in its old sense be at
once disadvantageous and of rare occurrence

 elucidation√¢Äîwhere the object is to give
clearness to an obscure term
 disambiguation√¢Äîwhere it is to fix the
sense of an ambiguous term this operation has
been termed distinction by some logicians and
erroneously reckoned as a species of division
 ampliation√¢Äîwhere it is to extend the
sense of a term
 restriction√¢Äîwhere it is to restrict the sense
of a term

the above division of the operation of expo

sition may not at first appear to be attended with
much practical use yet there might probably

exposition



be found some advantage if every writer who
gives a new exposition of a term were to con
sult this list and observe to which of the above
species his exposition may be referred he might
thereby be the better enabled to judge whether it

answers the special purpose for which it was
framed

let us now proceed to examine the view taken

of this field by dr whately
√¢Äúdefinition√¢Äù says he √¢Äúis another meta

phorical word which literally signifies √¢Äòlaying
down a boundary and is used in logic to signify
√¢Äúan expression which explains any term so as

to separate it from every thing else as a bound
ary separates fields√¢Äù p 
the first part of this exposition is performed
in that mode which is above denominated arche

typation and will probably be found correct
though in this case it can scarcely suffice

let

us submit the second part to a logical scrutiny
according to the rules given in p of the
elements

according to the first rule √¢Äúthe definition
must be adequate i e neither too extensive nor
too narrow for the thing defined√¢Äù meaning of
course that whatever is designated by the name



ch

vi

of the thing defined must answer to the defini
tion and that whatsoever is not so designated
must not answer to it



a definition is √¢Äúeither essential or acci
dental√¢Äù

√¢Äúan accidental definition assigns cir

cumstances belonging to the essence but which
are not constituent parts of the essence√¢Äù √¢Äúe g
philip was a man of macedon who subdued
greece c√¢Äù

is this definition conformable to

the above rule and does it agree with the above

exposition of the word definition does it dis
tinguish philip from every thing else might
there not for aught we know have been another
√¢Äúman of macedon who subdued greece√¢Äù

it

is true there is an c but you may continue to

substitute properties for the c to all eternity
without arriving at any certainty of distinguish
ing philip from every other man unless indeed
you

mention time and place but then the defini

tion becomes essential not accidental

the fact

is that the explanation here given of the word defi

nition is such as to make it refer only to the essen
tial not to the subsidiary modes of exposition
 thus dr whaley has observed that description of spe
cies cannot belong to this head because the properties may not
be universal that is that if an individual be deprived of

exposition



the rule also quoted above is applicable only to
the essential modes

again he says that definition is an expression
that

explains

√¢Äúany term so as to separate it from

every thing else√¢Äù so if we were to define
logic a √¢Äúterm consisting of the letters l o g

i c√¢Äù it would be separated from everything else
but is that a definition according to the author√¢Äôs

ideas in order to include all the matter which
he probably intended and no more than that
he might have said √¢Äúany term so as to separate

the idea represented by it from any other idea√¢Äù
the second rule is that √¢Äúthe definition must
be in itself plainer than the thing defined√¢Äù he
explains the expression √¢Äúin itself√¢Äù by the word

√¢Äúgenerally√¢Äù that is to say that the definition
must be plainer to the generality of the persons

to whom it is addressed than the term not the
thing defined in the abovementioned exposi
tion of the word definition √¢Äúit is an expression

that explains√¢Äù this rule may not be found to be
any such property such individual may still belong to the spe
cies but so it is in the case of individual description time
and place excepted thus if it be discovered that there is
reason to believe that philip was not born in macedon he
would still be the man who at such a time subdued greece



ch vi

so strictly conformed to as might have been
done for explain in this sense is a mere syno
nymous word to define the exposition would
perhaps be clearer and more correct if thus ex

pressed √¢Äúdefinition is an operation performed
in respect of any term so as to c√¢Äù this would
be a definition per genus et differentiam √¢Äúopera
tion√¢Äù being the genus and √¢Äúperformed in respect

of any term so as to c√¢Äù the species
there are several divisions given here of the

genus definition that is several classifications of
species or modes of definition
the first division is that of definition into no

minal and real which has already been examined
p 
secondly each of these is divided into acciden
tal and essential with regard to real definition
these submodes correspond nearly to description


or rather to individual description only and
to definition according to the list above given
but how is nominal definition divided into acci
dental and essential

if it makes no mention at

all of any ideas and consequently of properties
 i have used it in a different sense considering explana
tion of the idea as an operation corresponding to exposition of
the nord

exposition



how can it be divided according to the properties
it lays down

no examples are given of these

submodes of nominal definition and it might
not be a very easy task to find any

√¢Äúlastly essential definition is divided into
physical i e natural and logical or metaphysi
cal the physical definition lays down the real
parts of the essence which are actually separable

thus a plant would be divided physically by
enumerating the leaves stalks roots c of
which it is composed√¢Äù by a plant is meant i
suppose the collective entity plant or some spe

cies of plant not an individual plant now a
species as is ably shown in many parts of the ele
ments has no real existence and has therefore no

real parts real leaves stalks roots c may
appear at first to be parts of the collective entity
√¢Äúa plant√¢Äù but this is owing to the inaccuracy of
language the real idea is this that to the

genus plant belong all those entities which are
endowed with the property of possessing leaves
stalks roots c if these properties are not
essential to the constitution or to the essence

of the genus plant as in the case of leaves for
instance their enumeration belongs to descrip
 elements p 



ch vi

tion not to essential definition which would thus
be reduced to the second part viz logical defini
tion in the example of the proposition of which
the parts subject predicate and copula are
enumerated this enumeration is again one of pro

perties which in this case are all essential but i
do not see any thing more physical in the property
of being expressed by means of two terms and a
copula than in the property of expressing an
affirmation or a negation
these distinctions between dr whately√¢Äôs
several modes of definition may be thus exhibited
in a tabular form

exposition

by comparing this table with that of modes
of exposition given above the reader will be
enabled to judge to which author the following
paragraph may be applied
√¢Äúit is scarcely credible how much confusion
has arisen from the ignorance of these distinctions
which has prevailed among logical writers√¢Äù
elements p 





chapter vii

methodization

whatelys elements ch xi part i √¢ß division p 

the exposition of the general principles
of methodization and of its application in the
instance of some of the most important subjects
form a considerable portion of mr benthams
mss on logic the following short expos√£© of
the theory is chiefly abstracted from those papers
as the object of exposition is the conveying a
clear correct and complete conception of the
idea represented by a word so that of methodiza
tion is to enable the mind to entertain a clear cor
rect and complete notion of a number of ideas
either simultaneously or in succession in such
manner as to be able with facility to retain to
compare or to combine them with a view to the
accomplishment of any particular end
methodization may therefore be defined the
h



gh vii

putting a number of objects together in a particu

lar manner directed by design to a particular
end

methodization is either physical or logical
physical when the objects methodized are real
entities logical when they are ideas but as
ideas themselves have no real existence and

therefore cannot actually be placed in any order

it is upon the signs only which represent those
ideas that logical methodization can operate
these signs being words or names of the

ideas nomenclature that is the giving names is
as well as exposition an operation essentially

subservient to methodization and is accordingly
treated of in detail in the mss before me

much has however been already published on
this subject both in mr bentham√¢Äôs chrestoma
thia and in my abovementioned √¢Äúessai sur la
nomenclature et la classification c√¢Äù i do
not think it therefore necessary to repeat on the
present occasion what has there been said

methodization may be divided into two dis
tinct operations according to whether it has place
with or without regard to succession that is to

priority and posteriority these two modes of
methodization may be termed successive colloca


method zation



tion or simply collocation and distributive or
perhaps tabular methodization

the former di

rected more particularly to the purpose of facili
tating conception the latter to that of assisting
the operations of retention comparison and com
bination

conception is produced by communication
and this operation by means of discourse

it is

therefore upon the elements of discourse that
collocation operates
ideas are communicated in the succession of
time but as audible signs alone can be given in

the order of time visible signs their permanent
representatives must be arranged in the order of
place which according to certain conventional
rules is considered as emblematical of the order

of time thus priority with us is usually
ascribed to the top and to the lefthand of the
sheet but some nations consider the righthand
side as the first upon some occasions priority is
also ascribed to the bottom of the sheet c

the elements of discourse are words the signs
either singly or taken together of simple ideas
these words constitute sentences the signs of
propositions every discourse is formed of the
combination of sentences which when the dis
h 



ch vii

course is of sufficient length are combined into
more general aggregates termed paragraphs sec

tions chapters c
collocation consists therefore in the arrange
ment√¢Äîst of words in sentences d of sen

tences in paragraphs sections c d of
paragraphs sections c in a discourse the 
particular rules of collocation belong to the
theory of language a subject intimately con
nected with logic and which will form the
second part of my treatise but which might
appear irrelevant were it further detailed on the
present occasion
distributive methodization has place where
ideas are realized either in the shape of a whole


consisting of a number of parts or of a receptacle
containing a number of other ideas

it is indivi

dual or generic according to whether those ideas
are representative of individual or of collective
entities

in the latter case it has received more

particularly the name of classification
thus for example when we divide a regi
ment into battalions the regiment is considered in

the character of an individual whole consisting
of so many individual parts but if we divide
regiments into regiments of infantry of cavalry

methodization



of engineers of artillery c the word regiments
represents a collective entity or genus consisting

of so many species or collective entities of an in
ferior order

distributive methodization may be performed
by three distinct operations

 by dividing a given entity into parts

this operation has been denominated analysis
when performed upon individual entities logical
division in the case of collective entities

 by uniting a number of given entities into
a whole an operation termed synthesis√¢Äù in the
case of individuals generalization when per
formed upon collective entities
 by distribution for the performance of
this operation a number of wholes as well as

of parts are supposed to be already given but
as in the case of real entities the exhibiting of
wholes and parts might appear to constitute the
whole of the operation the figure is now changed

the aggregate ideas are realized as receptacles
 also by some logicians physical division it includes
both the resolutio and the partitio of saundersons logic for
i do not perceive any distinction between his √¢Äúpartes consti

tutive√¢Äù and √¢Äúpartes integrantes√¢Äù see saundersons logic
p 



ch vii

into which the several given partial ideas are

supposed to be placed or distributed
of these several operations those which re
late to individual methodization can scarcely be
considered as appertaining to the province of
logic the tactical branch of which science re

lates rather to classification and more particularly

to division as being the most important in the
present state of human knowledge the theory
of generalization belongs chiefly to the logical
history of the formation of ideas and of lan
guages which will be attempted in as far
as it is suggested by conjecture in a chapter

of the theory of language forming the se
cond part of my abovementioned treatise

on logic distribution is so closely allied to
division that it may not be worth while to con

sider it separately

a single example may

suffice on the present occasion to shew the mode
of operation of generalization and distribution

a botanist visits a country with whose pro
ductions he is as yet unacquainted he sees a
number of plants which resemble one another
very strongly and which differ considerably from
any other plants which he has seen or heard of
he discovers successively several of these sets of

methodization



plants and by generalization he forms as many

new species characterized by the properties he
has observed in these several individual plants
on referring to his books he compares the
several properties there given as characteristics
of general classes with those which are possessed
by his several new species and thus decides to
which of these general classes the species in ques

tion belong this may be termed distributing
those species under their superordinate genera
suppose that by the addition of these new

species some one class or logical genus may
now consist of so many as to render it difficult
to compare them or to retain their distinctive
properties without the help of some intermediate
classes these classes may be formed either by
dividing the genus into subclasses or by dis
tributing the species into groups in this case
division and distribution appear to be so closely
allied as scarcely to be distinguishable otherwise
than by the form of expression
the operation of logical division has been
thus characterized in a preceding page √¢Äúfrom
a general class constituted by the combination
of any number of properties the forming sub
classes by the additional consideration of other



ch vii

properties applicable to a part only of the indi
viduals to which the general class in question

refers√¢Äù this general class is termed superordi
mate with relation to the subclasses into which

it is divided the subclasses are subordinate to

the general class and coordinate with regard to
one another

dr whately following the example of ari
stotelian logicians lays down three or four
general rules for division but these rules are not
equally applicable on all occasions nor to all
modes of division the theory of the operation
may be said to consist of five considerations 
the particular end in view or object of the di
vision the nature of its subject the
source or principle the mode of division
 the extent to which it should be carried
i the first consideration is that of the end

inview or purposes which it is intended that the

division should accomplish these purposes are
either practical or logical the practical pur
poses depend upon the particular branch of art
and science which it is intended to assist as for

ex agriculture natural history the commis
sariatart c see elements p the
logical purposes relate to the manner in which it



methodization

is intended that this assistance should be given

that is upon the mental operation for the per
formance of which method is to serve as an in

strument as for ex for exposition retention
invention c

ii the logician should next consider the
nature of the subject of his division that is of
the summum genus or general aggregate which
contains the whole subject with the characters
which separate it from all other aggregates which
may happen to be connected with it or contigu
ous to it with reference to the particular endin
view

thus if a √¢Äúfarmer√¢Äôs stock√¢Äù be the sub

ject of classification it is necessary to know what
constitutes stock how it is distinguished from

farmbuildings c c
iii he must choose the most advantageous
source of division that is the nature of the

properties which are best suited for the charac

terizing the parts or results of division this
selection of properties depends of course upon
the endinview and particularly upon the prac
 i have preferred the word source to that of principle
made use of by dr whately the latter word appearing to me

to be too general and applicable perhaps to the aggregate of
the above five considerations






ch vii

tical purpose of the classification

thus the

agriculturist may divide live stock according

to the usefulness for cultivation of the differ
ent animals as compared with the expense of

keep prime cost c

the naturalist divides

animals according to their conformation the
commissary may derive his divisions of ani

mals from their usefulness as furnishing food or
as beasts of draught c
when two separate divisional operations
are performed upon the same genus and are
derived from different sources they may be
termed coordinate divisions



iv the mode of division to be adopted on
each occasion will be found to depend upon the

logical purpose of the operation

if the object

be to give an exact and complete exposition of

the parts into which the subject is divided the
only mode which can answer the purpose is that

which may be termed contradictory bifurcate divi
sion

where either relention of the names of the

species and of their reference to the genus or

exemplification of the genus is the chief purpose
in view the loose or irregular multifurcate di

vision may be found adequate or even more ap
propriate

methodization



the contradictory bifurcate mode consists in
the dividing the genus into two species accord
ing to some property possessed by all the indi
viduals referred to by one species and by none
of those referred to by the other irregular
multifurcate division consists in the dividing
a genus into any number of species whereby
this opposition is rendered impossible the
former mode can only ensure what logicians

call a perfect division the latter being liable to
incompleteness incorrectness or indistinctness of
parts

the rules for division usually given by lo
gicians apply to their perfect division dr

whately gives but three saunderson and others
have four which it may not be amiss to examine
on the present occasion

 √¢Äúmembra absorbeant totum divisum√¢Äù
let the parts exhaust the whole subject saun
derson p √¢Äúall the parts together must be
exactly equal to the thing divided therefore we
must be careful to ascertain that the summum

genus may be predicated of every term placed
under it and of nothing else√¢Äù whately√¢Äôs ele
ments p 

if the division be conformable to this rule



ch vii

it may be termed complete and the aggregate of
the species may be said to be allcomprehensive
such a division has also been termed exhaustive
but this can only be said of it with reference to
the particular source of division adopted and not
generally as every genus may be divided accord
ing to an infinite number of sources of division

 √¢Äúdivisum esto latius singulis suis mem
bris adaequatum universis√¢Äù let the subject be
more extensive than each of its parts equal to

them all saunderson p here we have two
rules the first is thus given by dr whately
√¢Äúeach of the parts or any short of them all
must contain less ie have a narrower signifi
cation than the thing divided√¢Äù in other words
the rule amounts to this √¢Äúlet the whole be

greater than each or any short of all of its
parts√¢Äù if any means be found of dividing any
thing so that the whole shall not be greater than
its parts then the utility of this rule may be dis

cussed till then few persons will derive much
advantage from learning a rule which they can
not transgress the second part of the above

 du trieu manuductio ad logicam ed lond p
 after giving the rule √¢Äúdivisum debet plus continere



methodization

rule of saunderson is but a repetition of the first
rule of completeness




√¢Äúmembra condividentia sint contradis

tincta et opposita ita ut confundi nequeant vel
coincidere√¢Äù

let the condivident members be

contradistinct and opposed so that they may

neither be confounded nor coincide this may
be termed the rule of contradistinction and oppo

sition or generally the rule of distinctness con
tradistinction applying to distinctness in expres

sion opposition to distinction in the partial ideas
themselves this rule is thus given by dr
whately √¢Äúthe parts or members must be op

posed i e must not be contained in one an

other√¢Äù which does not appear to me so clearly
expressed as it is by saunderson

quam singula membra dividentia√¢Äù thus exemplifies the

cor

responding defects √¢Äúhinc vitiosa est ista divisio anima
tium aliud sensitivum aliud homo aliud brutum nam sensiti

vum quod est unum e membris dividentibus est convertibile
cum diviso√¢Äù but who is there who would think of dividing

√¢Äúanimals√¢Äù into √¢Äúmen√¢Äù √¢Äúbrutes√¢Äù and √¢Äúsensitive beings√¢Äù
aristotelian logicians usually include the distinction of

the two senses of an ambiguous word amongst the modes of
division i should rather reckon it as a species of exposition
see above p 
f





ch

vii

after these three rules the only ones given

by whately saunderson adds a fourth which
may rather be considered as an attempt to indi
cate the mode of division best adapted for secur
ing completeness and distinctness than as a gene
ral rule of division

as essential qualities of the √¢Äúdivisio perfecta√¢Äù
and having perceived that opposition is necessary
to distinctness and that opposition supposes two

to consider that if the successive bifurcate divi

sions of logical aggregates were carried on to
the lowest stage necessary for classification and
if at the same time names were given to every
one of the intermediate aggregates so formed√¢Äî
this operation would on many occasions be
attended with more labour than advantage and
would require too great a strain on the memory
he therefore added the restriction that dichoto

my was only to be made use of when it could be
easily performed and that it should not be sought
out on all occasions with that superstitious strict
ness with which the ramaeans followed it

on this occasion he has not considered that

there are generally two distinct logical operations
which classification is intended to assist the one

is exposition which requires the perfecta divisio
performed by contradictory bifurcation the other
is retention which may be better assisted in many
instances by multifurcate divisions the latter
may happen to be as complete and distinct as the
other but it cannot be made so nor can any
assurance be had of its being actually so unless it
be proved by the application of a contradictory
bifurcate division to the same subjectmatter
the above principle may be rendered more



ch

intelligible by means of an example take for
instance as a summum genus or subjectmatter
of division the class of animals called vertebra
ta if the object be merely to give a general
idea of the kind of animals that are compre

hended in that class and if it be not necessary
with reference to that particular object to define

exactly the nature of the several subclasses or spe

cies which it contains you may divide vertebra
ta generally into mammifera birds fishes
lizards and serpents and you may thus de
scribe these several species of animals √¢Äúmam

miferae are those who suckle their young birds
are animals which have wings and feathers fish
have fins and live in water lizards are little ani

mals with four legs and scaly skins serpents
have no limbs at all but crawl upon their bellies√¢Äù

this classification may answer the purpose of
those who only wish to obtain a slight and general
idea of vertebrated animals but it cannot suffice

for the naturalist who must always be assured of

the allcomprehensiveness of his classes and sub
classes he must always be enabled to ascertain

precisely to which of them he should refer any
individual animal that comes under his observa

tion for this purpose his classes and sub

methodi zation

i

classes must all be distinctly characterized they
must be allcomprehensive and contradistinct or
opposed and his divisions must therefore have
been performed in the contradictory bifurcate
mode



it may be objected that if a genus be di
vided into any number of species such characters
may be given to them as that each shall be dis
tinguished from all the others and that when
taken together they shall comprehend the whole

of the individuals included in the genus this
certainly may be done and is done but if the
process be analyzed it will be found in such
cases to be in fact the same mode of contradic

 tory bifurcation expressed in another form for
the characters to answer the purpose of distin
guishing a species that species must be succes
sively compared with all the others and a pro
perty must be mentioned by which it is distin
guished from each of them the species is then
constituted by the coexistence of these properties
and all the other species are mentally combined

into one second species characterized by the
absence of any one or more of these properties
let us again take as an example the above
mentioned class of vertebrated animals and di
i

vide it into four subclasses or species thus cha
racterized

mammifera√¢Äîvertebrata endowed with mam
mae and with lungs
birds√¢Äîwertebrata deprived of mammae but
endowed with lungs and with wings
fish√¢Äîwertebrata deprived of lungs

reptiles√¢Äîvertebrata deprived of mammae
and of wings but endowed with lungs
this division is complete and its species are
distinct but only because it is in fact the result
of three successive divisional operations carried
on according to the contradictory bifurcate mode
as may be seen by reducing it to the following
tabular form

vertebrata are

mammae viz

it must be carefully remembered that these
observations apply to the logical division of
collective entities only not to the analytical divi

analysis not being per

formed by the attribution of

properties the above

contradictory formula cannot be applied to it as
was attempted by reid and kaimes when they
endeavoured to cast ridicule on this mode by

dividing england into middlesex and that which
is not middlesex that which is not middlesex
into kent and that which is not kent c

middlesex kent that that is that part of en
gland which is not middlesex c are not pro
perties but names of individual entities
the advantages and importance of this con
tradictory bifurcate division being fully detailed
and exemplified in the essays on nomenclature
and classification above alluded to i shall not

for the present proceed any further with this
subject
√¢Ä¢ in the english work chrestomathia in a synoptical
table of the principal branches of art and science this mode of
division was pursued to a considerable extent and in the
french essai i carried it in some instances still farther at
the same time

singleworded or at any rate twoworded de

nominations were given at every stage to each of the species
formed as these names were necessarily derived from a

foreign language for the purpose of comprising them in the
compass of one or two words they have for the most part
a harsh and barbarous appearance a circumstance which
i 



ch vii

w the mode of division as well as its
sources being determined the next and last con
sideration relates to the extent to which it is ad

viseable to carry the successive subdivision of
the subjectmatter the further it is carried
the more complete is the idea entertained of the
aggregate but at the same time the labour
both of the operation itself and of the conception
and retention of the distinctive characters of the

several species is increased in proportion to the
number of those species the point where con
tradictory bifurcation should cease and multi

 may tend to throw discredit upon the system of division which
is there adopted though it be entirely unconnected with that
system it might have been better in framing the above
mentioned table to have omitted those adjective appellations
derived from the greek and usually terminating in scopic
and in some instances even the substantive

appellations

of

several of the branches do not appear to have been necessary
as for example anoopneumatology all those which commence
with parono and prostheno c the advantages as well of
the distinctness and allcomprehensiveness of the divisional
operations as of the introduction of denominations such as
somatology pneumatology posology physiurgics anorgano
logy noology c would have been more readily perceived
had these denominations been abstracted from all others which


as above might be considered as superfluities

such thing as an infima species as any one how
ever low is susceptible of still further subdi

source of division with reference to the purpose in

tinguishes logical from physical or analytical
division

as to his explanation of the figurative expres

sion of the √¢Äúgenus containing its species√¢Äù√¢Äù
it might perhaps be considered in a somewhat

different light

the names genus and species

are not usually given absolutely to the aggre

gate of characteristic properties as it is im
plied by dr whately but figuratively to
the aggregate of the individuals possessed of
those properties and considered with relation to
those properties only in this sense the genus

that is the indefinite number of individuals re
presented by the name of that genus is formed

of the sum of the several species that is of the
several indefinite numbers of individuals repre

sented by the names of those species and it
therefore may well be said to contain those
species

we now come to the theory of ratiocination

ch

more details than the nature of the subject might
perhaps otherwise have warranted
before entering upon the theory of deduction

or syllogistic ratiocination dr whately devotes
the second part of his synthetical compendium to
the exposition and classification of the various
species of propositions which are also the sub
ject of the present chapter
the author defines a proposition√¢Äîst a
√¢Äújudgment expressed in words√¢Äù dly a
√¢Äúsentence indicative√¢Äù excluding demands and

questions i should rather say that judgment
in the sense in which it is here used is synony

mous to proposition and that a sentence not a pro
position is a √¢Äújudgment expressed in words√¢Äù
a proposition i have already said in speaking
of the mental faculties is the result of an exer
cise of the judicative faculty which faculty is also

occasionally designated by the same name judg
ment a sentence is the enunciation of a propo
sition by visible or audible signs the two ap
pear to me to be exactly coextensive in sense
only that in one case ideas are referred to in the
other case words only but as ideas cannot be
represented but by words we are obliged in

speaking of a proposition to have before our

propositions



eyes the very same object which we also call a
sentence

thence arises the confusion between

these two words but a careful attention to the

cases where each is made use of will i believe
prove that in ordinary practice when the idea is
meant to be understood the word proposition is

made use of and when the physical expression of
the idea is referred to it is by the word sentence
to borrow an example from the work before
us let us take the proposition or sentence √¢Äúan

intemperate man will be sickly√¢Äù p call it
a proposition and we should say it consists of

three parts viz a subject an intemperate man
a predicate sickly and a copula will be speak
of it in the character of a sentence and you
would say that it is composed of six words viz
an article an a substantive man two adjectives

intemperate and sickly an auxiliary verb will
and a verb in the infinitive be

√¢Äúa sentence√¢Äù says dr whately is the

√¢Äúgenus√¢Äù of a proposition and consequently more
extensive in signification

this genus of his

appears to contain three species the indicative
that is the enunciative the imperative and the
interrogative to the first of these alone he ap
plies the term proposition



√¢Ä¢

ch

further on he divides the same genus √¢Äúsen
tence√¢Äù into two species the absolute and the
hypothetical a division which he says is also ap
plicable to propositions because it is a species of
sentence for the exposure of the fallaciousness
of this argument it may be necessary to quote

the authors words by means of which another
conclusion may be drawn directly contradictory
to the abovementioned limitation of the sense of

the word proposition
√¢Äúsince the substance i e genus or material
part of a proposition is that it is a sentence and

since every sentence whether it be a proposition
or not may be expressed either absolutely as
√¢Äúcaesar deserved death√¢Äù or under an hypothesis
as √¢Äúif caesar was a tyrant he deserved death√¢Äù
on this we found the division of propositions ac
cording to their substance viz into categorical

and hypothetical√¢Äù elements p 
in the same manner we might say
√¢Äúsince the substance i e genus or material

part of a proposition is that it is a sentence and
since every sentence whether it be a proposition

or not may be expressed either affirmatively as
√¢Äúcaesar deserved death√¢Äù or under an interroga
tion as √¢Äúdid caesar deserve death√¢Äù on this we

propositions



found the division of propositions according to
their substance viz into affirmative and interro
gative√¢Äù and what then becomes of the exclusion
of questions
the fallacy of the above arguments may be
more easily detected by reducing them to the
following form


a proposition is a species of sentence
a sentence may be divided into two species the absolute
and the hypothetical
therefore
a proposition may be divided into two species the abso
lute and the hypothetical

this fallacy according to my classification
ch xi of this outline belongs to the head of
obscure expression and to the species which i

have denominated √¢Äúfallacies in extent√¢Äù

here it may be seen that no such conclusion can possibly

if propositions be defined as above √¢Äúthe
immediate result of the exercise of the judicative
faculty√¢Äù questions would of course be included

as they are in fact the enunciation of the state of
our mind with regard to the faculty of desire of
that species of desire of which the object is the
acquirement of some particular information
√¢Äúdid caesar deserve death√¢Äù is an abbreviation

for the expression √¢Äúi desire to know whether
caesar deserved death√¢Äù

on account of these abbreviative forms used

on the occasion of questions commands c
i should say that propositions are either simple or
compound simple when the two terms are both
of them names of entities single or many
worded common or proper compound when
one of the terms is a proposition and the other

expressed or implied some one of our psychical
faculties



simple propositions are those which are deno

minated by logicians pure and categorical
compound ones include dr whately√¢Äôs modal
categorical propositions as well as commands
and questions the affinity of which to the modal
will readily appear from the analysis of the ab
breviative forms of discourse




propositions



let us take the following examples extracted
from dr whately√¢Äôs elements
did caesar deserve death

an intemperate man will probably be sickly
in these instances the interrogative form in
the former the word probably in the latter are
but abbreviations for propositions expressive of
states of our mind with relation to the proposi
tions √¢Äúcaesar deserved death√¢Äù √¢Äúan intempe

rate man will be sickly√¢Äù and might be thus
translated

√¢Äúi am desirous of knowing whether cae
sar deserved death√¢Äù√¢Äîan expression of the state
of my faculty of desire analogous to the simple
proposition √¢Äúi am hungry√¢Äù that is √¢Äúi am

desirous of food√¢Äù
√¢Äúi am believing in the probability that an
intemperate man will be sickly√¢Äù√¢Äîan expression
of the state of my faculty of belief

as to the proposition √¢Äúbrutus killed caesar
justly√¢Äù it is an abbreviative form for the follow
ing proposition
the action of brutuss killing caesar was a
just action
 
s i know of no verb or participle expressive of that degree
of belief which answers to probability an intermediate de
gree between conjecture and certainty



ch viii

a command may in the same way be called
an expression of the state of the faculty of will
it might be objected that every proposition
which i have called simple is the expression of
absolute belief with relation to another proposi
tion and therefore not simple but compound
true it is that absolute belief is generally im

plied but as it is not intended to be absolutely
expressed nor even in many cases intended to be
implied i should prefer considering as simple all

propositions in which neither the state of the
speakers mind is expressed nor yet the relation
of the proposition with any other
i have not mentioned hypothetical proposi

tions which if they be propositions at all should
be referred to the class of compound ones

but

i should only consider as such those which dr
whately subsequently calls conditional proposi
tions and of which i shall give an analysis in
speaking of the irregular forms of syllogistic ar
guments in my next chapter
as to the other species of propositions which
are included amongst dr whately√¢Äôs hypotheti
cals and of which he gives the following exam

ple √¢Äúcaesar was either a hero or a villain√¢Äù
it appears to me to be nothing more than a simple

proposition of which √¢Äúcaesar√¢Äù is the subject



propositions

and the aggregate √¢Äúhero and villain√¢Äù the pre
dicate

simple propositions are next divided by dr
whately into affirmative and negative universal

and partial which word i should prefer to par
ticular

before i examine into these divisions

it appears to me necessary to define more exactly
than he has done the nature of the several com
ponent parts of a proposition reduced for the

purpose of deduction to its most simple and
regular forms
every simple proposition may be reduced to the

expression of a relation between two ideas thetwo
ideas are represented by the two terms subject
and predicate the relation itself by the copula
the two terms must therefore be expressed
by nounssubstantive or by substantive locutions
the copula by the verbsubstantive with or with
out the addition of other words according to the
nature of the relation expressed


the species of relation here referred to are
those of identity and diversity and of logical
√¢Ä¢ the diversity expressed in logical proposition is always
absolute not contingent resemblance and difference and other
modifications of diversity mentioned in the classification of
entities are not taken into consideration in the syllogistic
process diversity here signifies nonidentity





ch

viii

subalternation these are the only ones which
are taken into consideration in syllogistic argu

ments the expression of every other relation
whatsoever being included in the substantive
names of the terms

 there is another species of relation√¢Äîor rather a modifi
cation of the relation of identityof which the expression is
commonly included in the copula this is that of time but

this relation is not taken into consideration in the process of
logical deduction the only precautions to be taken against
being led into error by any modifications of time are either that
the identity be the same in respect of time in all the proposi
tions which enter into a syllogism or that that of the major
premiss be general and indefinite in which case that of the
conclusion must be the same as that of the minor premiss
for these reasons the copula is commonly used in the present
tense as referring generally to any indefinite portion of time
or particularly to one point which must always be the same
in all the propositions of a syllogism if the copulae of all
the propositions be in the past or the future tenses no
logical deduction can be made unless the exact time be fixed
by some such expressions as √¢Äúalways√¢Äù √¢Äúat such a time√¢Äô
during such an operation√¢Äù c
go

thus in the syllogism √¢Äúa robber is a man pernicious to
society every man pernicious to society is a man deserving
punishment therefore a robber is a man deserving punish

ment√¢Äù√¢Äîthe copulae of all three propositions are in the pre
sent tense as expressive of no particular portion of time if
we say √¢Äúcaesar nas a tyrant tyrants are men deserving

pro positions



these terms may be either both of them
individual or one of them individual and the

other collective or both of them collective
i if both terms are individual the relation
of identity and diversity is the only one that can
be expressed as logical subalternation refers
only to collective entities identity is expressed

by the copula is diversity by the copula is not
as for example √¢Äúgiovanni is john√¢Äù √¢Äújohn is

not peter√¢Äù an affirmative proposition is that
which expresses identity a negative one that
which expresses diversity

ii a common name that is the name of
a collective entity has already been defined √¢Äúa
name given to the aggregate of an indefinite
number of individuals√¢Äù

from this definition

death therefore caesar nas a man deserving death√¢Äù√¢Äîthe
minor premiss is in the past time and as the major is in the
present indefinite the conclusion is in the same past time as
the minor premiss but if we say √¢Äúcaesar nas a tyrant√¢Äù

√¢Äútyrants will be men deserving death√¢Äù we cannot syllogisti
cally deduce any conclusion from these premises in which the
two copulae express two different portions of time nor yet
could we draw any logical conclusion if the two propositions
were √¢Äúcaesar nas a tyrant√¢Äù √¢Äútyrants nere men deserving
death√¢Äù unless some words were added to indicate that
they both refer to the same portion of past time
k





ch viii

may be deduced the relations which a collective
entity can bear to another collective entity or
to an individual relations which have been
termed relations of subalternation

there cannot exist any identity between an

individual and a collective entity for the one is
always definite in number the other never is so
but there may or there may not be identity

between the individual entity in question and
some one of the individuals represented by the
collective entity the intimation that it is some
one individual contained in the collective aggre
gate and not the whole aggregate that is spoken
of is conveyed in latin by the addition of the

word aliquis to the name of that aggregate as
for example √¢Äúaliquis homo est johannes√¢Äù in
english the same relation is differently expressed
according to whether the individual is placed first
or last in the proposition in the former case
the word a is prefixed to the common name as
for example √¢Äújohn is a man√¢Äù in the latter
case it can only be done by prefixing some such
manyworded expression as some one for exam
ple √¢Äúsome one man is john√¢Äù

iii in the case where both terms of a propo
sition are collective entities identity and diversity
may have place





propositions

 between any individual referred to by one
term and any individual referred to by the other

ex the identity between equiangular and equi
lateral triangles







 between any individual referred to by one
term and any one of a part only of the individu

als referred to by the other ex the identity
between men and animals

 between any one of a part only of the

individuals referred to by the one and any one of
a part only of the individuals referred to by the
other term ex the identity between quadru
peds and swimming animals 

wherever a term is intended to be applied to
any individual referred to by a common name
that term is called universal

wherever it is

intended to be applied to any one of a part only

of such individuals the term is called partial


in affirmative propositions universality is
ascribed to the first term by the prefixing to the

common name the words every or any to the
second term by the word

any

but in the latter

case it seems necessary to express identity more

distinctly than by the simple copula is by some
such expression as is the same as in the same
propositions partiality is ascribed to the first
r 



ch

viii

term by the words some or some one in latin
aliquis to the last term by the same words
when the first term is partial by the word a
when the first is universal

ex

every horse universal is a quadruped par
tial
some quadrupeds partial are some flying
animals partial
every equiangular triangle universal is the
same as any equilateral triangle universal

in negative propositions universality is
ascribed in the same manner as also partiality
to the first term but in the case of the first
term being universal the negative sign in the
english language must be combined with the
sign of extent of the second in order to avoid
ambiguity ex gr

every horse universal is no cow partial or
universal

some quadrupeds partial are not flying ani
mals partial

 the idea is usually conveyed by putting the term
in the plural without any prefix but then partiality is rather
implied than expressed and on some occasions for the pur

pose of logical accuracy it may be found necessary to express
as above the prefix some

 

propositions

every equiangular triangle universal is the
same as no isosceles triangle universal or partial
if we were to say every horse is not a cow it
might also imply that some horses are cows
every individual entity being incapable of
logical division and therefore of being expressed

partially is logically considered as an universal
term

simple propositions considered in regard
to the above relations may therefore be either
affirmative or negative and each term may be
either universal or partial these propositions
are therefore reducible to the eight following
forms in which in order to abstract every idea

not connected with the substance of each species
i have expressed the two terms by the letters x
and y their identity by the mathematical sign 

diversity by the sign ii universality by the words
in toto and partiality by the words ex parte or
for the sake of still farther brevity by

prefixing

the letters t and p as signs of universality and
partiality

these forms are

 x in toto y ex parte
 x in toto il y ex parte

or tx py



x in toto y in toto

or t x t y

but as in all equations it matters not which
member is expressed first the two last of these
forms are identical with the two first and may
therefore be omitted it being more common as
well as more convenient to express the universal
term before the partial one the second form
may also be suppressed as the fourth expresses
the same idea in a manner more convenient for

the deductive process

for if all the individuals

represented by x be different from any portion of
those represented by y they must be different
from all of those represented by y
we shall therefore reduce these forms to five

logicians in general make no mention of the
first form which they consider as useless and
they say that the predicate or second term of

propositions



a proposition is never distributed that is uni
versal

i should think however that this

assertion can scarcely be logical many fallacies
arise from the considering terms as synonymous
which are not so in reality and it may be
found as advantageous to reduce perfect identity
to a logical form as partial identity or perfect or
partial diversity

the other four of the above forms of propo
sitions are usually designated by the four letters

a e i and o and are called universal or partial
according to the extent of the first term which
rule is expressed by the following verses
asserit a negat e sed universaliter ambae
asserit i negat o sed particulariter ambo

but as the dependence of propositions upon
one another when reduced to the above forms will

always be selfevident i should consider that the
science would be much more simple and at the
same time less liable to fallacy if the whole system
framed by means of the changes rung upon

these four letters were entirely omitted i shall
not therefore enter into any further details on

the subject but proceed to examine into the

other species of propositions mentioned by dr
whately



i perfectly agree with him that indefinite pro
positions should not be considered as a class in

respect of quantity but i should go still farther
and say that they are neither more nor less than
a species of ambiguous propositions and if we
do not know in any other manner the exact
sense in which an indefinite must be construed

that proposition in itself cannot clear up the am
biguity
as to the division of the matter of propositions
into necessary impossible and contingent it
might be as well to suppress it altogether both
as useless and in the present instance ill ex
pressed by employing these words in a sense
so different from that which is usually attached to
them an appearance of something very learned
and intricate is given to two propositions or rules


which we are told to bear in mind but which really
convey no information at all and as to any other

practical result that may be afforded by this

division of propositions i cannot find any exem
plification of it in the work before me

propositions



the two abovementioned rules are as fol
lows

√¢Äúin necessary matter all affirmatives are
true and negatives false in impossible matter

√¢Äúin necessary and in impossible matter an

sidering the meaning of the terms√¢Äù p 
from these definitions it is evident that the words
reasoning discourse and argument are not only
confined to the deductive process but that they
only differ from single syllogisms by the loose and
irregular mode of expression
the various senses attached to the word rea

soning have been spoken of in a former chapter of
the present outline i have also adverted to the

uselessness and inconvenience of considering the

word discourse as a synonym to reasoning it is
only upon these two occasions pp and 
that dr whately preserves this aristotelian ap
plication of the word for in the rest of his
work he employs it in its ordinary english sense
as for instance in p √¢Äúas is often done


in common discourse√¢Äù a few lines after having
said √¢Äúdiscourse expressed in words is argu
ment√¢Äù

as to the words argument and syllogism
which are more particularly the subject of the
√¢Ä¢ in the elements this definition with that of an argu
ment are combined in the form of an argument of which one
of the premises is √¢Äúsince logic is nholly concerned in the

use of languages√¢Äù if this proposition had been entirely
free from obscurity and ambiguity the reader might have had
at once the benefit of an example and a definition



ch ix

above definitions the distinction which dr
whately here establishes between them is that

the one the argument may be expressed in any
words whatever the other the syllogism is

an argument reduced to a certain regular form of
expression thus the sense of the word argument
is much further restricted than he himself pro
bably intended for it cannot include the sorites
for instance which he afterwards classes amongst
√¢Äúall arguments besides pure and categorical syl
logisms√¢Äù

it might be more convenient however to
make use of this word argument in its more ordi
nary and far more extended sense applying it to

any ratiocinative operation however complicated
the leading definitions which relate to the pre

sentsubject might then be expressed as follows
every process of ratiocination when ex
pressed in language is an argument

a syllogism is a name given to every portion of
an argument which without altering the sense
is reduced to that simple and regular form in
which the absolute truth of a simple proposition
follows necessarily from the exhibition of one
or two other simple propositions also regarded as
absolutely true

deduction



every argument which is reducible to one or

more syllogisms is a syllogistic argument when
ever it contains doubtful propositions or when
the absolute truth of one proposition does not
follow from the exhibition of the others it is
called an inductive argument
√¢Äúevery argument consists of two parts that

which is proved and that by means of which it is
proved the former is called before it is proved
the question when proved the conclusion or in
ference that which is used to prove it if stated
last as is often done in common discourse is
called the reason and is introduced by √¢Äúbecause√¢Äù

or some other causal conjunction eg √¢Äúcaesar
deserved death because he was a tyrant and

all tyrants deserve death√¢Äô if the conclusion be
stated last which is the strict logical form to
which all reasoning may be reduced then that
which is employed to prove it is called the pre
mises and the conclusion is then introduced by
some illative conjunction as √¢Äòtherefore eg
√¢Äúall tyrants deserve death
caesar was a tyrant

he deserved death√¢Äô√¢Äù elements pp

the theory of logic in as far as it relates to
deduction consists in the reducing syllogistic ar
guments to the simple and regular form of syllo
gisms this operation is generally considered as
the only immediate object and practical result
of the whole study of logic to this it is that dr
whately through the whole course of his work
labours to restrict the field of that branch of art
andscience and it is the apparent futility of this
operation as compared with the abstruse and

complicated system invented by aristotle for the
effecting the purpose that has brought so much
discredit upon the name as well as upon the

study of logic in general
i need not to repeat upon this occasion what
i have so frequently said of the greater extension

which i have given to the field of the science
but i must devote a few words to the refutation of

the alleged inutility of the operation which forms
the subjectmatter of the present chapter

few persons would probably consider the
pursuit of so difficult a science as satisfactory
if convinced that it were of no other use than as
an exercise to the mind though in the established

course of education much time and labour be
devoted to no better purpose this exercise



deductio n



may be an advantage attending upon this study
as well as upon any other but it cannot be

one of great weight in the scale of comparison of
the various human sciences if i had thought
the importance of the theory of deduction had
been derived from no other source if i had even

attached so much weight to such a consideration
as appears to have been done by dr whately i
might perhaps have continued to follow aristotles
ingenious contrivances so well suited for that pur

pose but the exercise required of the mental
faculties in the pursuit of science in general is
already so great that the object of the instructor
must be rather to diminish that which is neces

sary than to add to that which is otherwise use

less the utility therefore of the theory of
deduction can only on the present occasion
be derived from the means it affords for detecting
 even

supposing that no practical improvement in ar

gumentation resulted from the study of logic it would not

by any means follow that it is unworthy of attention the
pursuit of knowledge on curious and interesting subjects for
its own sake is usually reckoned no misemployment of time

and is considered as incidentally if not directly useful to the
individual by the exercise thus afforded to the mental facul
ties√¢Äù elements preface p xi

fallacies many are the occasions when an argu
ment by its lengthy and complicated form ex
hibits apparent proof and thereby produces con

viction of a question which may be replete with
error when if the argument were strictly ana
lyzed and if at every step the proof were reduced
to its simplest form the various obscurities ambi

guities and other devices made use of by the
artful argumentator would be detected and the
delusions he had created would at once disappear
this effect of the reduction of argument may
have already been exemplified in the course of the

preceding pages upon one or two occasions
where i have sought to point out the errors of some
of dr whately√¢Äôs arguments and the general
theory of the detection of fallacies will be more

particularly the subjectmatter of a future chap

ter for the present having stated this as the
general object of the theory of deduction i must
now proceed to the details of that theory and
first to the analysis of a syllogism when reduced

to its simplest form





 

 

a syllogism consists of one or two simple

propositions called premises and of the conclu
sion consisting in another simple proposition
the premises are stated first and are connected



deduction

with the conclusion by means of the illative con

junction therefore√¢Ä¶the conclusion is said to be
proved by or deduced from the premises the
exhibition of the premises from which a conclu

sion is deduced is said to be the proof of that
conclusion



these several propositions must each of
them be reduced to some one of the five simple
forms which are exhibited in the preceding chap
ter viii that is they must consist of √¢Äútwo sub
stantive terms with their respective signs of ex
tent and of a copula expressive of the identity
or diversity of those terms√¢Äù
when there is but one premiss the syllogism
may be termed a conversive syllogism in this

case the terms of the conclusion are the same
as those of the premiss the difference consists in
their transposition as for ex
some boasters are cowards or
therefore
some cowards are boasters 

 

p x p y
therefore

p y p x



√¢Äòforthebetter comparison of my system with drwhatelys
i have every where selected my examples of syllogisms from
his elements i have also added the simple abstract forms to

which they are reducible expressing always the mean term



ch

i x

in transposing the termis care must be taken
not to change their sign of extent and it is in
order to avoid this defect that the extent should

always be distinctly expressed if left to be
understood it is apt to be mistaken and thereby
to produce erroneous deduction as for ex
it might appear that √¢Äúif cowards are men
men must be cowards√¢Äù but if the understood

signs of extent be expressed this argument stands
thus



all cowards are some men or t x p y
therefore

all men are some cowards

therefore

t y p x

which is evidently no syllogism 
it might be objected that this rule has not
been observed in the following syllogisms where

a term which is partial in the premiss is univer
sal in the conclusion viz
no virtuous man is a rebel or t x p y
therefore

no rebel is a virtuous man

√¢Ä¢ therefore

t y p x

but it has already been proved that in a simple
logical proposition √¢Äúwhere two terms are sepa
by the letter y the extremes by the letters x and z x

being the minor z the major wherever this distinction has
place



d eduction

rated by the sign of diversity if the one be uni
versal the sense is the same whether the other
be universal or partial√¢Äù the first terms being
universal in both these propositions we may
consider the last terms as universal also in which

case we have the selfevident syllogism t x t y
therefore t y ii t x
this species of syllogism is by logicians
termed conversion and is treated of by dr




whately under the head of propositions ch ii
part ii √¢ß yet from his own definition as
compared with that which he gives of an argu
ment it cannot but be considered as a species of

argument √¢Äúno conversion√¢Äù he says p 
√¢Äúis employed for any logical purpose unless it

be illative i e when the truth of the converse
follows from the truth of the exposita or propo
sition given√¢Äù the only difference between
this definition of conversion and that of argu
ment p is that in the former case the

premiss is called the exposita and the conclusion
the converse



the exposition of what constitutes illative

conversion and conversion by limitation or per
accidens which occupies the whole of p is so
replete with technical phraseology as to render



ch ix

itdifficult to discover itsreal object which appears
however to be no other than the following simple
rule that √¢Äúin transposing the terms their respec
tive signs of extent must not be changed√¢Äù 

conversion by negation or contraposition
p is no syllogism but merely one step
taken in the reduction of a proposition to its
simple form it is merely the substitution of an
affirmative instead of two negatives or vice vers√£§
as for ex √¢Äúevery man is for √¢Äúno man is not√¢Äù
if this be considered a conversion we may say
that the whole operation of reduction of argu

ments is a series of conversions and in this case
every syllogism also must be considered as a step
in the process of reduction but this is not the
sense which i should think it most convenient to

attribute to these words on the present occasion
the reduction of an argument i should say is
the successive substitution of strictly synonymous
locutions till each proposition be reduced to some
one of the five simple logical forms the syllo

gism including the conversive syllogism is the
 
deduction of one such proposition from one or
√¢Ä¢



from two others

√¢Ä¢

 







when a syllogism consists of three proposi
tions there are two premises and a conclusion 

deduction



 √¢Äú every syllogism has three and only three
terms viz the two terms of the conclusion√¢Äù one

of which is contained in each of the premises
and which are called the two extremes and the

mean term which is the other term of each of

the premises as for ex t x p y t y p z

therefore t x p z
where the mean term is universal in one

premiss and partial in the other the former
premiss is called the major premiss the latter
the minor premiss and the two extremes are
also termed major and minor according to the
premiss in which they are placed thus in the
foregoing example √¢Äút x p y√¢Äù is the minor
premiss √¢Äút y p z√¢Äù is the major premiss x
the minor term z the major term and y the
hall



logicians usually say that all syllogisms
have a major and minor premiss but in the fol
lowing example

 


 i have preferred the word mean to that of middle as being

more familiar in an analogous sense in mathematical ratios
as well as for the sake of avoiding such expressions as am
biguous middle undistributed middle which occur so frequently
in dr whatelys elements

observe that in every syllogism the terms
must be so arranged that where their extent is
different the universal is mentioned first the
partial last
the five species of simple propositions as
given in the table at the end of my last chapter
may be combined three by three in a variety of
ways by transposing the terms and by changing
the signs of extent or those of identity or diver
sity nineteen of these combinations have been
separately designated by logicians by a set of
appellations thus collected into five latin verses
barbara celarent darii ferioque prioris
cesare camestres festino baroko secundae

tertia darapti disamis datisi felapton
bokardo feriso habet quarta insuper addit
bramantip camenes dimaris fesapo fresison

and a variety of rules more or less complicated


or incomprehensible have been invented to
shew in what cases each of these combinations





deduction

produces a legitimate syllogism dr whately
has in some measure simplified this system and
rendered it more intelligible to the student still
however preserving the greaterpart of it but
if every legitimate syllogism must by the defini
tion of the word be selfevident without the help
of these rules might we not suppress altogether
a system which requires so much labour to un
derstand it so much strain on the memory to keep
it in mind and which after all rather takes away
from than adds to this selfevidence p might
not we substitute a few plain and simple axioms
the truth of which cannot be denied and which

may be found to contain in general terms

every

principle upon which a syllogistic conclusion
can be founded such may perhaps be found

the four following





 things which are equal to the same are
equal to one another
 when of two things one only is equal to
a third and the other is not equal to that third

these two things are not equal to one another
 parts of a part are parts of the whole of

that part that is of the whole of which that
part is a part
 when the whole of a class is said to be



 ch ix 

equal to or different from the whole or any
part of another class it is meant that every indi
vidual referred to by the first class is the same
as or different from any individual referred to
by such whole or part of such other class
the first two of these four axioms are given

by dr whately as √¢Äúaxioms or canons by which
√¢Äòthe validity√¢Äù of all pure categorical syllogisms
are to be proved√¢Äù√¢Äîin the following words
 √¢Äúif two terms agree with one and the same
third they agree with each other√¢Äù √¢Äúif one
term agrees and another disagrees with one and
the same third these two disagree with each
other√¢Äù



but these two axioms thus expressed are only
applicable to those syllogisms in which the mean
term is universal in both premises for it is

then only that the two extremes are precisely
equal to the same mean take for instance
the syllogism √¢Äúevery x is a y every y is a z

therefore every x is z√¢Äù if we prove it by the
first of the above axioms and say that the two
terms x and z agree both with the term y
therefore they agree with one another and do

not take into account the signs of extent we
should then be obliged to admit the truth of the

ded uction



syllogism√¢Äîan x is a y a z is a y therefore an
x is a z which is evidently false though strictly
conformable to dr whately√¢Äôs canons of which
he says √¢Äúno categorical syllogism can be faulty
which does not violate these canons√¢Äù



 it is true that in page he attempts to
explain away this difficulty by saying that in
the case of the mean term being universal in one
premiss and partial in the other √¢Äúif one extreme

has been compared to a part of the middle term
and another to the whole of it they must have

been both compared to the same√¢Äù but what is
meant by the word same to what substantive is
this adjective understood to be applied cer
tainly not to the same substantive which is under
stood in the axiom

there it is a term

here it

cannot but be √¢Äúsome particular portion of the
collective entity designated by the mean term√¢Äù√¢Äî

which is a very different thing there he says
√¢Äúwhen two terms agree with the same third√¢Äù

understand term

here he says √¢Äúif one ex

treme be compared to a part of the middle term
and another to the whole of it they must have
been compared to the same√¢Äù understand part of

the middle term
it is in order to obviate all these difficulties of



ch ix

expression with regard to the concordance and
disagreement of collective entities that i have
thought it necessary to modify the expression
of dr whately√¢Äôs two axioms and to add two
others the last of which may perhaps be consi

dered rather as an explanation of the relations of
collective entities to one another than strictly
speaking as an axiom
in order to show the allcomprehensiveness of
these rules or axioms in as far as they relate
to syllogisms it might not appear irrelevant if i
were to exemplify them in the case of some of the


syllogisms given by dr whately in his and 
as examples of the √¢Äúbarbara√¢Äù forms i shall
therefore after quoting each of these syllogisms
in the form in which it is exhibited in the ele

ments reduce it to the simple forms above de
seribed subjoining on each occasion the simple
general expressions of the several propositions of
which it is composed

this regularity of form the character he gives of
a syllogism thus when he has given as a

the conclusion he is obliged to express it sub
stantively transforming it to √¢Äúsome who are

of verifying the exact identity of the two terms
the syllogism would have been much clearer
and certainly not more complicated if so much

ostensive reduction the reductio ad impossibile

elements as well as the theory of opposition ex

doubt very ingenious contrivances and indicate
great powers of mind on the part of the grecian
philosopher who invented them but if mere
reduction with the help of the above four
axioms be found to answer the purpose and

to be sufficiently clear and comprehensible this
whole aristotelian system might henceforth be

very properly consigned to oblivion as tending
rather to conceal than to expose fallacies to im

pede rather than to assist fair intellectual argu
ment

there only remains now therefore to

examine into the mode of reduction of the various

irregular arguments which are treated of in the
supplement to part iii of dr whately√¢Äôs synthe
tical compendium
arguments in common discourse are fre

quently exhibited at full length that is to
say that the premises as well as the conclusion
are all expressed in this case all that remains to

be done for their reduction is to place the several

deduction







propositions in their proper order and to reduce
these propositions themselves to their respective
simple forms
the subject of a proposition is in the english

language usually expressed substantively and
is what is called the nominative of a sentence
the infinitivef of a verb being also included
amongst substantive expressions in this case
the only difficulty is in the sign of extent which
in common discourse is frequently omitted but
which in a logical argument must be distinctly
exhibited in order to prevent its being misunder
stood

the predicate of a proposition is frequently
expressed by adjectives verbs or other parts

of speech complicated in sense though abridged
in form

the adjective being expressive of a charac

teristic property of the subject must be reduced
to the substantive form by the addition of the
superordinate genus of the subject with the sign
 in latin the expression called ablative absolute is an en
tire proposition of which the substantive is the subject the
adjective or participle the predicate and the ablative form im

plies the copula which is understood

 of partiality thus in the proposition √¢Äúcrassus
is rich√¢Äù the adjective predicate rich may be
transformed into the equivalent substantive ex
pression a rich man by the addition of man

the name of a superordinate genus of crassus
with the sign of partiality a
the verb is generally a combination of the
copula with the whole or part of the predicate

by substituting the corresponding participle with
the ordinary copula the predicate is separated
and converted to the adjective form from whence

it is reducible to the substantive by the foregoing
rule as for example √¢Äúhe preaches√¢Äù reduced

wherever negatives occur in a proposition
they must be reduced to the single sign of nega
tion attached to the copula or else they must be
included in the substantive term not attached to

it for in that case they would render it adjec
tive thus in the proposition √¢Äúplants are not
animials√¢Äù not must be considered as attached to
the copula for if we were by what is called
conversio per accidens see elements p 
to attach the not to animals the term notanimals

becomes adjective the superordinate genus must
be added and the proposition thus reduced be
comes √¢Äúevery plant is a beingnotanimal√¢Äù
all negative propositions might thus be reduced
to affirmatives but it appears to be a useless

complication where two negatives however
occur in a proposition the corresponding affirma

tive should be substituted as √¢Äúno man is not an
animal√¢Äù reduced to √¢Äúevery man is an animal√¢Äù

as to modals he speaks only of modal pro

positions although he thus classes them under
the head of syllogisms these propositions
have been analyzed in a former chapter
with regard to hypotheticals propositions
and syllogisms are also in some measure con

more categoricals united by a copula or conjunc

causal in page we learn that a syllogism
consists of three categorical propositions united
by a causal conjunction might we not from
these premises draw the conclusion that a syl
logism is a hypothetical proposition

according to my view of the subject the de
nomination of hypothetical proposition should
be restricted to those which dr whately terms

conditional the hypothetical proposition may
therefore be considered as a √¢Äúcompound propo



deduction

sition in which both terms are exhibited in the

form of propositions and in which doubt is ex
pressed√¢Äînot as to the relation of the terms √¢Äì
but as to the existence of one of the terms or

rather in which it is intended to assert the rela
tion alone and not to express any judgment upon
the truth of the existence of the subject
thus for example in the hypothetical pro
position √¢Äúif a is b c is d√¢Äù√¢Äîthus reduced to
the form of a categorical proposition √¢Äúthe case

of a being b is a case of c being d√¢Äù√¢Äîthe rela
tion of dependence is expressed between the
circumstance of √¢Äúa being b√¢Äù and that of √¢Äúc

being d√¢Äù but it is not asserted either that a is
b or that c is d
a hypothetical syllogism is that in which one


of the propositions is hypothetical as √¢Äúif a is


b c is d but a is b therefore c is d√¢Äù thus
reducible to the ordinary form

for the syllogism of which it forms a premiss
the complex hypothetical argument the di

thence to the ordinary forms as explained by dr
whately but in the case of all these combinations
of hypothetical syllogisms their validity being
much more evident in these abridged forms than
in any other their reduction in practice would

be entirely useless what has here been said
on the subject has only been for the purpose
of distinguishing them from such as require re
duction

the enthymeme when exhibited as an ar
gument should always be completed for the
purpose of ascertaining what is the suppressed

premiss arguing from a premiss which is left to
be understood by every hearer as he pleases will
of course and frequently does lead to fallacious
conception the avoiding of which is the object
of the theory of deduction

an enthymeme expresses nothing but one
premiss and a conclusion which does not follow
from that premiss alone it therefore does not
express a syllogism but merely a compound pro

position of which both terms are single proposi
tions and which differs from the hypothesis by the
assertion it contains of the truth of these elemen

tary propositions that is of the truth of the ex

istence of the terms which they constitute when
we say √¢Äúcaesar was a tyrant therefore he de
served death√¢Äù one of these propositions does
not follow from the other and therefore it is

no argument but merely a compound propo
sition

but if we suppose a tyrant to have been de
fined √¢Äúa person deserving death√¢Äù which is the

same as if we suppose there to be another pre
miss √¢Äúall tyrants deserve death√¢Äù thus reduced
√¢Äúevery tyrant is a person deserving death√¢Äù the
enthymeme becomes a syllogism of which this

premiss is understood

the use of these distinctions is to avoid a very
frequent fallacy arising from the use of the en
thymeme by this form an appearance of argu
mentation is often given to a single assertion
the conclusion may appear to be the result of the
expressed premiss the truth of which may be in
controvertible but when you come to examine

what must be the understood premiss in order to
form

such a conclusion

you will often find that

it is one of which the truth is very doubtful not
to say absolutely impossible

the sorites elements p might be easily
reduced to a regular series of syllogisms were

there any use in the operation the enthymematic
sentence p is one in which a pronoun is used
for a noun at least in the author√¢Äôs example

√¢Äúall useful studies deserve encouragement

reverts once more to the great extension of the
field of logic of which he accuses logicians in
general a topic which has been too often dis

cussed to be again entered into at present his

mention of it is on the occasion of introducing
the chapter on fallacies an important one in
the ratiocinative part of logic but this is a
subject of which i must defer the consideration

to the deductive operation

induction

whatelys elements province of reasoning ch i induction
p 

the next mental operation which according
to the general view i have taken of the field of
this science comes under the head of logic is

that of induction which may be thus character
ized √¢Äúfrom the existence of a fact or from the
occurrence of a phenomenon certain or probable
in any one case or in several similar cases the in

ferring that a similar fact or phenomenon has
place in some other analogous case√¢Äù whatso

ever general rules can be given as to the degree
of probability of the data or premises as well as
to that of the conclusion or fact inferred√¢Äîsuch

rules form the subjectmatter of the theory of in
duction



this operation is by dr whately excluded

from the province of logic and only treated of

induction

incidentally in his elements as a subject con
nected with logic he therefore has not thought
it necessary to give a regular definition of the
word induction but the meaning he attaches to

it when different in sense from deduction or
syllogistic ratiocination may be gathered from

the following passage
√¢Äúwhether the induction in this last sense has
been sufficiently ample ie takes in a sufficient
number of individual cases√¢Äîwhether the charac

ter of those cases has been correctly ascertained√¢Äî
√¢Äîand how far the individuals we have examined

are likely to resemble in this or that circumstance
the rest of the class c c are points that re
quire indeed great judgment and caution but
this judgment and caution are not to be aided by
logic because they are in reality employed in

deciding whether or not it is fair and allowable
to lay down your premises i e whether you are
authorised or not to assert that what is true of
the individuals you have examined is true of the
whole class and that this or that is true of those

individuals√¢Äù p 



 that is when it cannot be stated syllogistically

i

ch

x

the above is not an incorrect general expo
sition of the operation of induction and true it

is that this operation cannot be of any practical
use without applying it to some particular sub
ject and that then the correctness of the opera
tion √¢Äúcannot be decided without a competent
knowledge of the nature of the subject√¢Äù but it
may be useful in a general point of view to
know in what that competent knowledge con
sists√¢Äîin what light the several subjectmatters
of induction must be considered for the purpose

of that operation and√¢Äîas induction cannot as
has been already stated produce a conviction of
absolute certainty but only of probability to a
greater or less degree√¢Äîwhat are the best means
of ascertaining that probability and these seve
ral investigations of the process of enquiry or

rules of induction might i should think with no
great impropriety be considered as a portion of
the study of logic
and if it has been shown that syllogistic de
duction also cannot be of any practical use with
out applying it to some particular subject √¢Äîif
moreover it has been proved that it cannot be

performed with accuracy unless the terms shall

induction



be free from ambiguity or obscurity and shall
be exactly defined in point of extent√¢Äîand if
these qualifications cannot be given to the terms
without a competent knowledge of the nature of

the subject√¢Äîthen it may probably be admitted
that deduction as well as induction consists only
in √¢Äúgeneral rules for the most advantageous ap
plication of a mental operation whatever may be
the nature of the subject to which it is applied√¢Äù
and in such case it may not appear quite clear
why the deductive process should in preference
to the inductive claim the sole right to the com
mon denomination of logic
drwhately insists much upon the erroneous
ness of the prevailing idea that there are two
kinds of reasoning for he conceives that that
portion of the inductive operation which may be
called reasoning is in fact syllogistic that is

that if two premises are granted as true the con
clusion must be true

but how many cases are

there not where the absolute truth of the

pre

mises is not granted or where that of the con
clusion does not certainly follow from such pre
mises and yet where a certain degree of reason
ing has place no one fact no occurrence nor

even the existence of any thing which does not
come immediately under our own observation
can be proved by syllogism alone though

founded on observation without the help of in
duction suppose a tells me that a certain
event has occurred if i have always found that a
has told the truth whenever i have had opportuni
ties of verifying his assertions if there is nothing
in the event in question in contradiction to what

i myself have observed in analogous cases may
i not infer that that event has in fact occurred
is not this reasoning is it not an argument

and can it be reduced to asyllogism arethere
here √¢Äútwo and only two premises from which
the truth of the conclusion follows by the mere
iforce of expression√¢Äù if these questions bean

swered in the negative it can scarcely be possi
ble to agree with the author who asserts that
there are not two species of reasoning

the in

ductive and the syllogistic 
this assertion is attempted to be explained
by saying that when induction is reasoning it is
a syllogism in which the major premiss is not
expressed but understood thus he b would

probably convert the above example to the fol
lowing syllogism
√¢Ä¶ 
 



induction



a tells me that a certain event has occurred
a always tells the truth
therefore 
that event has occurred

but this is nothing to the purpose i do not
intend to assert that a always tells the truth so
that i cannot absolutely prove that the event he

tells me of has really occurred yet i wish to
infer the very great probability of it and this i
do by the abovementioned induction not by any

syllogism
in the general survey i had taken of the field


of logic with a view to my treatise i purposed

devoting a chapter of that work to the exposition
of the considerations upon which the validity of
an induction appear to depend i shall now at
tempt to give an outline of these several con

siderations but without any pretensions to com
pleteness the subject appears to me to be new 
it had not even been treated of in mr bentham√¢Äôs

 in this exemplification of dr whatelys system i have
considered the assumption of this premiss as warrantable it

appearing to me to be strictly analogous to the assumption of
the premiss √¢Äúnature is uniform in her operations√¢Äù in the

analogous instances he gives in his elements p

mss and it is on account of the diffidence i feel

with regard to my own view of it that i must

for the present refrain from entering into minute
details

induction appears to consist in the resolution
of the following problem
a fact or phenomenon having probably taken
place in a certain number of cases how far is its

occurrence probable in a certain other case

the answer appears to depend on the combi
nation of the following considerations
i ascertainment of the degree of probability
of the data

ii generalization of the data

iii application of the general rule to the

case in question
i ascertainment of the degree of probability
of the data that is of the facts or phenomena
which have been observed to have taken place in
a certain number of cases
this operation the judgment pronounced
on the occasion as to the belief in those data

may be founded on personal observation on
testimony or on previous induction three ele
ments which by some writers are collectively
designated by the denomination of evidence


induction



taking this word in the most extensive sense of
which it is susceptible
 personal observation of a fact that is the
perception of it by means of the senses is that

which in most cases produces the highest degree
of belief in the mind of the observer the pro
bability in these cases is so nearly equivalent to
certainty that it requires a very strong combina
tion of other sources of inference to produce any
doubt and scarcely anything but contradictory
observation or inductive proof founded on per
sonal observation will destroy the probability
thus when a spherical body placed in a glass
of water appears to me to be oval if i had
never observed myself that the body was in fact
spherical or had never inferred it from analogous

observations of my own such as that other bo
dies placed in a glass of water alter their appa

rent form c i should not perhaps believe
any one who were to tell me that the bodywhich
i perceived to be oval was in fact spherical
√¢Äúcan√¢Äôt you believe your own eyes√¢Äù is gene
rally supposed to be a conclusive argument and
is in reality such whenever there is not very

strong contradictory evidence
 the credibility of testimony is a vast and

complicated question which has been often con

sidered in its several bearings by a multitude of
writers by mr bentham amongst others who
has examined the question with much detail

in a judicial point of view in the work edited
by m dumont under the title of trait√£© des
preuves judiciaires and in another work of

five volumes now in the press considering
the subject at present in a logical and therefore
more general point of view the credibility of

testimony may be said to depend upon the fol
lowing circumstances√¢Äî



st upon the moral disposition of the witness
or witnesses these moral dispositions may be
comprised under two heads veracity and atten

tion the veracity of the witness depends upon

the motives which he may have on the particular
occasion in question for giving true or false

testimony and upon his general habits of sin

cerity or insincerity

contracted

the perfection or imperfection or the sanity or

tended sense of the several simple mental facul
ties which are called into action by the observa
tive faculty it has already been stated that these
simple faculties are chiefly those of perception
conception attention memory judgment and
perhaps comparison and abstraction any one
of these faculties may be and is frequently found

to be impaired either by want of intensity or
by erroneous operation whilst the others may
be perfectly sound and possessed of great inten
sity want of intensity may be exemplified in
the case of the states of mind generally termed

stupidity carelessness of mind or inattention
forgetfulness c by erroneousness of opera

what they are in reality under this head may

also be classed misrecollections and the substitu
tion by the retentive faculty of the produce of
the imagination for the results of perception or

conception as for ex when we believe that a
thing has really happened which we have only

imagined in our dreams erroneousness of opera
tion of the mental faculties has been frequently
termed insanity of mind and should also com
prehend what is occasionally called unreasonable
ness taking this word in the sense in which
it signifies the not being convinced by absolute
proof

number of persons through whom the testimony
has been transmitted since it was founded on per
sonal observation to each of which transmittors
the consideration of the several sources of cre

dibility must be applied d the mode of trans
mission in each particular case whether or not

such as likely or not likely to have given place to
misexpression on the part of the transmittor or to
misconception on the part of the receiver of the

testimony the several modes of misexpression

and species of misconception will be adverted to
in the next chapter on fallacies
 when a fact is inferred from previous in

 

duction its degree of probability is necessarily
founded on the combination of the various consi

derations i am now detailing

ii generalization of the data generaliza
tion has been defined in a former chapter √¢Äúthe
imagining a class or indefinite number of indivi
duals endowed with certain properties abstracted
from all the others possessed by the particular
individuals observed√¢Äù

such is the definition of

the term when taken in its general logical sense
upon the present occasion this sense will be
found to be somewhat modified the particular

species of generalization which is subservient
to induction may be characterized as follows
√¢Äúthe supposing that certain facts are likely to oc
cur in a certain class of cases√¢Äù in logical gene
ralization the property generalized is essential to
the class formed that is it is the one which con

stitutes that class in inductive generalization
it is an accidental property to which a greater

or less degree of universality is ascribed with
reference to the individuals belonging to a class
already formed



ch x 

 this distinction may be illustrated by the ex
ample of a magnet extracted from dr whately√¢Äôs
elements



 

a number of individual substances were ob

served to attract iron by logical generalization
a class was formed of which this circumstance

was made the characteristic property or connect

ing tie and to which class was given the common
√¢Äúname magnet

√¢Ä¢

subsequently to this a number of these indi
vidual magnets were observed to possess also that
property which is denominated polarity and

by inductive generalization universality was
ascribed to that property and it was supposed
that all magnets are endowed with polarity

 this example leads me to advert to a slight
incorrectness which may be observed in the ele
ments where logical generalization appears to
have been confounded not only with inductive

generalization but with the whole operation 
of induction

√¢Äúin natural philosophy√¢Äù it is

said p √¢Äúa single instance is often accounted
a sufficient induction e g having once ascer
tained that an individual magnet will attract
 

 see elements p 

induction



iron we are authorized to conclude that this pro
perty is universal√¢Äù but in this example the
operation is logical generalization not induction
having observed that an individual substance
attracts iron we form a class of which √¢Äúthe
attracting iron√¢Äù is the characteristic property

see elements p and when we give to this
class the name of magnet we merely substitute a
singleworded denomination to the compound
appellation √¢Äúsubstances attracting iron√¢Äù there
fore in the example above quoted the concluding
that √¢Äúthis property is universal√¢Äù is merely
the concluding that magnets are magnets

the validity of inductive generalization or
the degree of universality to be ascribed to a cer
tain fact with reference to a certain class of cases

appears to depend√¢Äîst on the constancy of the

fact in the cases observed that is on the number
of individual cases in which this fact has been ob

served to exist or not to exist d on the nature
of the connection between the fact and the cases in

question that is on the nature of the relation be
tween the property of which the universality is
supposed and that which constitutes the class to
which this property is applied
 the constancy of occurrence of the same



ch x

facts in analogous circumstances has been attri
buted to what is termed the √¢Äústability of the laws

of nature√¢Äù upon which occasion it may be well
to quote dr whately√¢Äôs words
√¢Äú√¢Äòthe stability of the laws of nature√¢Äù which
is our constant assumption in inquiries relating
to natural philosophy assumes many different
shapes and in some of them does not appear to
possess the same absolute certainty as in others


eg when from having always observed a cer
tain sheep ruminating we infer that this indi
vidual sheep will continue to ruminate we assume

that √¢Äúthe property which has hitherto belonged

to this sheep will remain unchanged when we
infer the same property of all sheep we assume
that √¢Äúthe property which belongs to this indi
vidual belongs to the whole species if on com
paring sheep with some other kinds of horned
animals and finding that all agree in ruminating
we infer that √¢Äúall horned animals ruminate√¢Äô we

assume that √¢Äòthe whole of a genus or class are
likely to agree in any point wherein many species

of that genus agree or in other words √¢Äúthat if
one of two properties c has often been found
accompanied by another and never without it

the former will be universally accompanied by

induction



the latter√¢Äù now all these are merely different
forms of the maxim that √¢Äúnature is uniform in

her operations which it is evident varies in
expression in almost every different case where
it is applied and admits of every degree of evi
dence from absolute moral certainty to mere
conjecture√¢Äù pp 
i have made this long extract for the purpose

of exemplifying the different degrees of con
stancy of a fact in a class of cases at the same
time the above passage has suggested some ob

servations which may not be found out of
place
drwhately having constantly in view the re
ducing inductive arguments to syllogisms con

siders inductive generalization as the assumption
of a major premiss which major premiss in
natural philosophy he says is always some form
of the maxim √¢Äúnature is uniform in her ope
rations√¢Äù thus in the three inductive operations
contained in the above passage the following
major premises are respectively assumed √¢Äúa
sheep which has ruminated will ruminate as long
as it lives√¢Äù√¢Äî√¢Äúall sheep ruminate√¢Äù√¢Äîand √¢Äúall
horned animals ruminate√¢Äù

now all these general propositions can only



ch x

be assumed when the supposed universality is at
tended with that degree of probability which is

for every practical purpose equivalent to abso
lute certainty and which is usually termed moral
certainty but this certainty is never in itself
absolute an expression which should logically
be reserved to the result of the mathematical or

syllogistic proof or at farthest to that greatest

degree of probability which as has been said is
produced by personal observation and how
many are the cases when the √¢Äúoperations of na
ture√¢Äù cannot be reduced to any rule of unifor

mity how many are the aberrations daily ob
served from those general rules which have been
regarded as the most constant thus it is that
more or less of doubt is thrown upon all induc
tive conclusions and it is this want of uniformity
that is so much in the way of regular classifica
tions of physical entities √¢Äù s to

these variations in the stability of the laws of
nature are observable with relation to ethical

sciences as well as in natural philosophy in
the general propositions that √¢Äúmen who have
long associated with those who consider robbery
as a meritorious act will themselves acquirea dis

regard for the right of property√¢Äô√¢Äù that iff white

induction



men are more generally intelligent than ne

groes√¢Äù that √¢Äúgravity is general in englishmen
levity in frenchmen√¢Äù c there is the samegra
dation in the universality of these several facts
as that which is observable in physical cases √¢Ä¶
 the degree of constancy of a fact is ascer
tained by the number of cases where this fact

has place as compared with the number of cases
of the same class where it has not place if the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of facts could be

ascertained at all times with absolute certainty
inductive generalization founded on the degree
of constancy would be reduced to a mere ma
thematical calculation of chances but as it has
been shown that this is not the case in the calcu
lation of the degree of constancy we must also

take into consideration the relative degree of

probability of the facts which militate in favour
or against the universal proposition in question
and their relative proportion as to number that
is the number of the facts recorded on each side
of the question as compared with the total sup

posed number of cases of the same class
 thus in the inductions brought forward by
phrenologists all the cases which they observe
to be in favour of their system are carefully ex



ch

x

hibited and recorded whilst their opponents less
interested in the controversy allow innumerable
instances which they might have adduced in
refutation to be neglected and forgotten if a so
ciety of antiphrenologists had been instituted at
the same time as that of the partisans of that sys
tem and if they had pursued their object with the
same zeal perseverance and talent they might
probably have discovered that if in the cases ac
tually recorded so great a number appear to give
some colour to their adversaries√¢Äô doctrine those

cases which have been neglected are equally con
clusive on the other side of the

question

but

there are always but few who devote their life to
the refuting an erroneous system as compared

with those whose sole object is the support of one
which is so flattering to the mind by its apparent
ingenuity and importance in no case does any
one examine skulls with so much perseverance as

a professed phrenologist who like all those who
apply their whole faculties to any particular
branch of study is generally ardent in support

of this his favourite pursuit is it then to be
wondered that he should endeavour to conceal
 
even from himself those cases where he had seen




led to pronounce an erroneous judgment and

induction



that he should carefully treasure up and publish
those where he had applied his theory with suc
cess p

 the second consideration upon which the
validity of inductive generalization appears to
depend has been stated to be the nature of the

connection between the fact generalized and the
cases in which it is supposed to have place
for the purpose of induction these connections
may be generally divided into coexistence and
dependence two facts may be said to be

merely coexisting when we suppose that the
nonexistence of the one would neither influence

nor modify in any way the existence of the other

and to be dependent on one another when we
suppose that the existence of the one would not
have place in the same manner if the other did

 coexistence in this case is with reference to place not
to time or at any rate not constantly and absolutely so thus
coexistence should in this case include those relations upon
which is founded the proverb √¢Äú misfortunes never come
alone√¢Äù applicable to the case where several misfortunes occur
successively though with no intervals of any length so in
the case of the general assertion that √¢Äúnations generally rise
gradually till they reach a maximum of prosperity and then
commence to decline till their ultimate fall√¢Äù



ch

x

not exist the importance of this distinction
will appear from the great difference of the va

lidity of inductive generalization in the two
cases



in the example above given √¢Äúall horned
animals ruminate√¢Äù the relation between the two

properties is merely that of coexistence without
any probability of dependence either of rumi
nation upon horns or of the existence of horns
upon the power of ruminating but as this co
existence has been observed in all cases and as the

contrary has not been observed nor even sus
pected we are fully authorised to come to the
above conclusion and yet there is so little cer
tainty in it that were we to hear of the existence

of an animal that had one of the above properties
without the other however small the degree of
credibility we attached to the information we
should not on account of the general proposition
we had formed deduct from the value of that

evidence but rather modify our generalization
in consequence of such information

with regard to ethical science amongst the
examples above given inductive generalization

men levity in frenchmen c for no percep
tible dependence has been observed between those

general moral dispositions and the being born in
one or the other country such coexistence is
for the purpose of induction reckoned of still
less value than that which relates to physical
science and this is so much the case that when
ever a general coexistence of two ethical proper
ties has been perceived it is always supposed
that there must exist some dependence although
hitherto unobserved of one property upon the
other thus if levity has been observed to be
a distinguishing feature in a frenchman√¢Äôs cha
racter it has been attributed to the climate to
the common mode of education c of that
country 
 coexistence of facts or phenomena is the
only ground upon which the theories of unlucky




days of many astrological predictions as in ger
man almanacks c c are founded the
arguments adduced in support of these theories
are at best mere calculations of chances and in

general these calculations are far from being fair
as every evidence of any moderate degree of pro
bability is brought forward if it tend to favour

the theory and on the other hand no evidence
o

of an opposite tendency is admitted but that
which produces all but certainty and which
cannot be in any manner set aside
relations of dependence are of far greater
importance and in a number of cases give a
degree of probability to the induction which may
amount to moral certainty though in many
others a variety of circumstances may cast over
it a considerable degree of doubt
these relations of dependence are those of cause

and effect an inductive generalization founded

upon these relations may be reduced to one of
the following general forms
 similar causes produce similar effects
 similar effects are produced by similar
causes



but these two propositions are very different
in the constancy of their application the first
has been so universally observed that it produces
in most minds absolute certainty and an induc

√¢Ä¢ by the word similar is here meant similar in every re
spect except as to the individual case to which it is applied
the idea is generally conveyed by the word same but in strict
logical language the latter word appears to indicate the same
individual cause not the same species of causes

induction



tion founded upon it seldom fails to convey proof
supposing the operation to be valid in other re
spects upon this is founded every act of our
life if we eat it is because we have experienced
that food satisfies hunger and infer that food
will again produce the same effect if we punish
a man with a view to prevent his committing a
second time a crime that he has been guilty of
it is because we have observed or heard that a

similar effect has been produced by punishment
in other instances

the investigation of the cause of an effect is
by no means so certain in its results the same
effect is often observed to be produced sometimes
by one cause sometimes by another and in those
cases the chance is generally equal as to which

is the efficient cause in the instance in question

provided however that there is no ground for
inference of the cause other than the knowledge
of the effect and yet how often do we not form
inductions in which we are obliged to content

ourselves with these uncertain grounds of in
ference



in physical science we are continually re
ferring to this second of the two abovemen
tioned

rules

matters of this science many effects come under

our observation without their cause being in any
way perceptible in these cases the method by
which we explain those facts or phenomena that
is assign causes or reasons for them is by an in
duction founded upon the analogy between those
facts and similar ones of which the causes are

known to us to which analogy we apply the above
proposition that √¢Äúsimilar effects are produced by
similar causes√¢Äù it is in this way only that we
explain the nature of heat and light c
the degree of reliance that may be placed

upon this species of induction may be illustrated
by the following example suppose a mechanist
had never heard of any such thing as a spring
that the rotatory motion of clocks and similar

instruments had never been observed by him to
have been produced otherwise than by weights

if a clock set in motion by a spring be so pre
sented to his view that he cannot see the clock

work supposing

him to know that the primum

mobile is not directly applied to it but only for
the purpose of winding it up would he ever
imagine that the motion was immediately pro

duced otherwise than by a weight
thus heat and light are supposed by some

induction



to be substances by others to be vibrations and
it is said that the effects produced can only be
accounted for in one of these two ways what is
meantismerely thatsuch are theonly causes which
in analogous cases have been observed to pro

duce analogous effects such is the tendency of
the observations and experiments on which are
founded the inductions adduced by the partisans
of each of these theories in support of their own

cause and as a further proof of his own system
each one endeavours to shew the impossibility of
the other but why may we not be in this respect
in a similar case to that of the abovementioned

mechanist p why may there not be some other

cause totally unknown to us which produces
light and heat
nothing shews that there is
such a one nor does it appear probable that there
should be but nothing shews positively that
there is not√¢Äînothing but a general unwilling
ness on our part to admit that there be one which
we can neither know nor guess at√¢Äîa feeling of
shame at the thought of the number of in

stances where the causes of the physical phe

nomena we observe are entirely hidden from
us

in the case of generalization founded on re



ch x

lations of dependence there is another difficult
and important consideration to be taken into
account which is whether such relations have
or have not place and what degree of influ
ence each particular cause may have on the
effect produced
in ethical science it is often very doubt
ful whether a general proposition be founded
on mere observed coexistence of facts or upon
the relations of cause and effect

thus when

from having observed that a told the truth
on all the many occasions when we have been
enabled to verify his assertions we conclude that
a always tells the truth this conclusion may
be in some measure founded on mere obser
vation of the hitherto coexisting facts of a√¢Äôs

speaking and of his telling the truth which
by a calculation of chances produces a pro
bability of his telling truth on all occasions
but we may also suppose a slight dependence
of the fact of as telling truth upon a cause
viz a habit acquired of telling truth result
ing from the data
in the above example the degree of in

fluence of the cause or supposed cause is but
small√¢Äîvery small if compared to that which is

induction



exemplified by the proposition √¢Äúa hungry man
will eat the food which is placed before him
when there is no more powerful motive tending
to restrain him from doing so√¢Äù
with reference to the degree of reciprocal in

fluence of cause and effect these relations may
be generally divided into immediate and remote
into direct and incidental

thus the immediate effect of attraction of gra
vitation is to make all bodies approach the centre
of the earth as long as no obstacle prevents their
so doing yet a body may be so placed as for
example on one end of a lever as that attraction

of gravitation may cause it to rise that is to
remove farther from the centre of the earth

in

this case the attraction of gravitation is the more
remote cause of the effect produced


the direct effect of a shower of rain is to
make the ground wet an incidental effect is to

promote vegetation which produces a very dif
ferent degree of universality in the two general
propositions √¢Äúall showers of rain wet the

ground on which they fall√¢Äù and √¢Äúall showers
of rain promote vegetation√¢Äù
from the above several examples some idea
may it is hoped be formed of the various cir



ch

cumstances which influence the validity of the
universality of an inductively general propo

sition i shall now proceed to examine into the
last of the three considerations upon the combi
nation of which i have said that the validity of
an inductive operation depends
iii application of the general rule to the
case in question having ascertained the degree
of probability of the data and thence of the
general proposition founded upon these data
there remains to be examined how far such

general proposition is applicable to the case to
which the induction refers whether there may

not be other modificative or contradictory gene
ral propositions applicable to the same case and
if there may to which of these general rules the
preference is to be given in regard to credibility

or to connection with the case in question
in many instances a general proposition ap
pears at first to be applicable to a particular case
when in fact there may be a number of circum

stances attending upon this case which may
take away its analogy with those upon which the
generalization was founded for ex √¢Äúa tells
the truth upon this occasion because he has al

ways been found to speak truth√¢Äù

but he may

induction



be at present in some degree insane or he may
himself entertain an erroneous idea on the sub

ject in question c which is supposed not to
have been the case upon the occasions on which
was founded the general rule of his veracity
and thus the analogy is entirely destroyed
with regard to the comparison of the several
conflicting general propositions more or less ap
plicable to the case in question it may be exem
plified in the following arguments

suppose that a asserts a fact and b denies it
that a has always been found to speak the truth
and that b has been frequently detected in false
hoods if these be the only data which can be
obtained the probability of the truth of the fact
in question will by most persons be reckoned
asconsiderable

but if it be added that a has

on this occasion a strong motive for concealing
the truth and b an equally strong one for de

claring it and if it be ascertained from other data
not only that men will in general depart from
their usual habits when actuated by a strong
motive but also that they will naturally speak
the truth when uninfluenced by any particular
motive either one way or another these proposi
tions in contradiction to the former ones will



ch

x

induce a much greater belief in the falsity of the
fact asserted by a and denied by b than was
formerly entertained of its truth and this be
cause on a comparison of the reasons for its
truth with those against it it will be seen that 
the former were founded upon mere observed co
existence of facts whilst the latter resulting from
a supposed dependence of cause and effect are
therefore attended with a much greater degree of
credibility
it is owing sometimes to the inability some
times to the unwillingness of the human mind to
take into consideration and to weigh the com
parative value of the several reasons or general
propositions which militate in favour or against
a particular theory that so many effects are prac
tically produced so different from those which
were intended or expected it is to the same
cause that must be ascribed the origin of the fal
lacious proposition that a thing may be good in
theory and bad in practice for in such a case the
theory is incomplete from not having taken into
consideration the obstacles to its application that
is the contradictory general propositions if
the famous steamengine which two years ago
was in the belief of many eminent engineers as



induction

well as in that of its inventor to have produced
such extraordinary effect as to supersede all
existing steamengines has on the contrary been
found capable of producing no effect at all or
next to none it is because in the theory on
which it was founded the waste of heat and other
obstacles were not taken into account
tain

philosophers have imagined

if cer

that they have

discovered a mode of establishing amongst men
absolute equality and commonalty of rights and
goods attended with absolute and lasting har
mony if their reasonings have appeared to be
convincing to their followers it is because they

have contrived to overlook such general and by
no means improbable propositions as that

√¢Äúmen

are not and cannot be made either perfectly free
from prejudices and passions or perfectly equal
in natural capacity√¢Äù or many other such ob
jections which might be opposed to them

such is the analysis of the process of induc
tion according to the view which i should be

disposed to take of the subject and which in
duces me to differ in opinion from the author of
the elements and to consider that there is a pro

cess of reasoning different from syllogism which
process i call induction

and having thus ex



ch x

plained the nature of the operation of the ratioci
native faculties there remains only to exhibit
what are the occasions upon which the operation
of these faculties is likely to produce an erro
neous effect a subject which will form the mat
ter of the ensuing chapter on fallacies but
before i conclude the present one i must pass a

hasty glance over the remainder of dr whately√¢Äôs
dissertation on the province of reasoning the

greater part of which will be found to bear some
relation to the present subject
next to the chapter on induction is a long
one √¢Äúon the discovery of truth√¢Äù in which we
have a great variety of matter much which had
already been said in former chapters some
which is now first brought to view and may
require some comment
first comes the demonstration of this propo
sition √¢Äúit is not by a process of reasoning that
new truths are brought to light√¢Äù which is de
duced from the following premises
√¢Äúall reasoning may be resolved into syllo
gisms√¢Äù and
√¢Äúa syllogism proves nothing but what is
virtually asserted in the premises√¢Äù


in order to facilitate the comprehension of



induction

this demonstration he premises three things

that is he requires that three things be granted
on which he founds his demonstration

the first of these three premises or pos
tulates is an explanation of the proposition to
be proved when he says that √¢Äúit is not by a
process of reasoning that new truths are brought
to light√¢Äù he does not mean to say that √¢Äúany kind
of truth can be elicited without reasoning√¢Äù but
that √¢Äúno new truth can be elicited by reasoning
alone√¢Äù it is very fortunate that he has given

us this explanation for i confess that the omis
sion of the word alone in the first enunciation
of the proposition was leading me far astray as
to his meaning



by the second postulate the word reasoning
is again restricted to syllogistic argument to
the exclusion of induction thus shewing that

in the conclusion the word reasoning is taken
in the same sense as that which it has in the first

or major premiss
the argument now stands thus
syllogisms prove nothing but what is virtually asserted
in their respective premises
reasoning consists entirely in syllogisms
therefore





ch

x

reasoning proves nothing but what is virtually asserted
in the premises it contains

from which he passes to the conclusion that √¢Äúby
reasoning no new truth can be elicited√¢Äù in vir
tue of the third postulate viz that a new truth
is that which is not √¢Äúvirtually implied and in
volved in any thing already known√¢Äù

with the help of all these explanations we
learn that we are to understand his argument as
follows



no new truth can be elicited by syllogisms alone
reasoning consists entirely in syllogisms
therefore

no new truth can be elicited by reasoning alone

unfortunately for myself not only can i not
see any use in this argument supposing it to be
correct but i cannot even admit either of the

premises i have often enough said why i do
not consider reasoning as consisting entirely in
syllogisms i shall now shew why i believe that

new truths can be and actually are elicited by
syllogistic reasoning

suppose i do not know or that nobody
knows that √¢Äúall equilateral triangles are equi

angular√¢Äù and suppose i discover this by a pro
cess of mathematical a species of syllogistic

induction



reasoning and by that alone which was pro
bably the case with the mathematician who did
discover it is not this discovery of mine the
discovery of a truth and is not that truth new
to all mankind pas new as the first discovery
of any unknown real object
both truths ex
isted before as is implied by the word discovery

but neither were known i do not deny that if
new be defined √¢Äúthat which is not known nor

can be deduced from anything which is known√¢Äù
the author may be right but i cannot see any
reason for distorting in so great a degree the
meaning of a word when that meaning has
been established on so firm a basis by long and
universal use a use adopted by dr whately
himself upon all other occasions but the present
one 

with regard to the several bearings of a pro

position and to the ten categories pp 
i must refer to what i have already said of pro
perties in ch w of description in ch wi and
 see p √¢Äúnen that is unperceived and unthought
of√¢Äù the fallacy exhibited on the occasion of the above
argument of dr whatelys appears to arise from something

more than mere obscurity of expression and to be referrible
to the head of √¢Äúfallacies of erroneous expression√¢Äù



ch

x

to the classification of entities at the end of
ch iii





in the next pages of the elements et seq
the author appears to repent of having limited the
application of the word new to √¢Äúthat which cannot
be deduced from what is already known√¢Äù and
considers it perhaps with more propriety as a
relative term applicable to whatever is not yet

known√¢Äîrelative both as to person√¢Äîfor a thing

which is new to one man may be old to another
√¢Äîand as to time√¢Äîfor a new thing when once
exhibited becomes an old one with regard to
the person to whom it is exhibited
the discovery of a new truth therefore now
stands defined √¢Äúthe elicitation of anything 
which is not yet known√¢Äù and as this discovery
may be made either with or without the imme
diate aid of observation and testimony two spe
cies or modes are here mentioned which are cer

tainly perfectly distinct and which dr whately

calls information and instruction√¢Äîi should

rather say elicitation by observation and elici
tation by ratiocination including under ob
servation in general both personal observation
and testimony and under ratiocination both
induction and deduction the sense of these



induction



several words has been so frequently detailed

that i do not think it necessary to enlarge any

more upon this part of dr whatelys elements
which appears to be generally rather confused
in its style and by no means rendered clearer by

the abovementioned alterations in the meaning
of the words new truth in the course of so few

pages
in the second section of the same chapter


p discoveries are divided into physical
and logical this division corresponds in a
certain degree to the preceding one into infor
mation and instruction the difference is that

induction is now coupled with observation in
the characteristic operations of physical disco

very and deduction alone constitutes logical
discovery i do not perfectly comprehend the
use of this double division nor can i form to my
self any clear idea of the particular object the
author had in view in writing this section i
must therefore request him to excuse any of my
remarks which may be found to be incorrect in
consequence of having mistaken that object

√¢Äúin all cases√¢Äù it is said p √¢Äúof the es
tablishment of a general fact from induction that
general fact is ultimately established by
p



 ch

k

reasoning eg bakewell observed c
 these facts were his data from which com

bining them with the general principle that na
ture is steady and uniform in her proceedings
he logically drew the conclusion that c 
but then his chief merit was in making the ob
servations in so combining them as to abstract

c also in conjecturing c the making
of such observations and still more the combina

tion abstraction and judgment employed are
what men commonly mean when they speak of
induction and these operations are certainly dis
tinct from reasoning√¢Äù


reasoning is the drawing a logical conclu


sion bakewell drew a logical conclusion by
combining observations this combination of
observations is distinct from reasoning i really
am greatly at a loss where to class this mode of
reasoning and am only the more inclined to

apply that same word reasoning to induction
as well as to deduction i should very much
doubt that bakewell ever thought of the √¢Äúuni
formity of the proceedings of nature√¢Äù he pro
bably had only found that facts were of such and
such a nature wherever he had attended to them

and that he had never heard of any instance 






induction

where they were not so accordingly by induc
tive generalization he supposed these facts to
have place in all similar instances

i see reason

√¢Äòing in this operation but no syllogism
one word more as to matter of fact dr
whately applies the term to such facts only which

rest upon the authority of observation or induc
tion not to those which are mathematically or
syllogistically proved is this in conformity to

the ordinary senses of the locution when it
has been proved that √¢Äúall equilateral triangles
are equiangular√¢Äù is not this coincidence a matter
of fact
section p relates to definitions
having already spoken of the identity of the


meaning of the term and the nature of the thing
i have now to advert only to the distinction made
between a mathematical and a logical definition
for there appears to me to be none a mathe
matical definition of a square is strictly analo
gous to a logical definition of an animal a man
or any other common terman enumeration of
the essential properties of the collective entity so
designated abstracted from all accidental pro
porties which any individual square body ani

mal man c may possess if the definition of
p 




ch k

a square may be given in the form of the postu
late √¢Äúlet a foursided figure of equal sides and

rightangles becalled asquare√¢Äô√¢Äôelements p
so may any other logical definition as fortin

stance that of a man √¢Äúman is a rational animal√¢Äù
may be thus expressed √¢Äúlet a rational animal

be called a man√¢Äù square as above defined is

the name of a collective entity formed of the pro
perties which constitute the superordinate genus
surface with the addition of that of √¢Äúbeing
bounded by four sides equal in length and placed
at right angles to one another√¢Äù and is appliea
ble to every individual object endowed with those
properties whatever others such object may
have

man in like manner is the name of a

collective entity formed of the properties which
constitute the superordinate genus animal with
the addition of that of rationality and is appli

cable to every individual object endowed with
those properties whatever others such object
may have
 
in the fourth section of this same chapter

p after two or three more pages on the
restriction of the word reasoning to syllogistic

argument are a few lines upon observation and
experiment a definition of the latter term might



induction

not have been useless on this occasion but has

been neglected by the author by experiment is
commonly understood any physical operation
which is performed with a view to assist obser
vation as for ex placing two substances in con

tact with a view to observe their reciprocal che

mical action or the hanging a weight to a bar of
iron with a view to observe the quantity that it
can support without breaking c

experience

is passive observation is active but purely

mental experiment is a physical operation
chapter iii on inference and proof elements
p upon this occasion i should again differ in
some measure from the author in my idea of the
sense commonly attached to the words he defines
√¢Äúproving√¢Äù he says √¢Äúis the assigning of a reason

or argument for the support of agiven proposition

and inferring the deduction of a conclusion from
given premises√¢Äù they √¢Äúare not two different
things but the same thing regarded in two dif
ferent points of view he who infers proves
and he who proves infers√¢Äù now suppose a
asserts that heat is a substance b objects that it
cannot be proved to be so √¢Äútrue√¢Äù says a

√¢Äúwe cannot prove it but we may infer it from
such and such wellattested observations√¢Äù

is



 a ch x 

this an incorrect mode of speaking and if not is

not inference best applicable to induction which
produces mere probability proof to deduction
or to such inductive operations only which by
the moral certainty of the conclusion are re
garded as equivalent to deduction
 

 true it is that √¢Äúthe word infer fixes the mind
first on the premiss and then on the conclu
sion the word prove on the contrary leads the

mind from the conclusion to the premiss√¢Äù but
this appears to be an incidental circumstance
which has arisen from the nature of the two ar
guments not a characteristic difference or at
any rate not the sole essential distinction be
tween the two operations in deduction the
conclusion is equally certain with the premises

and is usually stated first as being considered
the most important in induction the premises
are first held to view as being more certain than
the conclusion but in neither case is this ne

cessarily so and the questions how do you

and what do you might without impropriety
be respectively completed by the words prove or 

infer it may not be very good english to say

√¢Äúwhat do you prove from that√¢Äù but i do not
think that the most rigid grammarian would 



induction

object to the expressions √¢Äúwhat do you prove
by means of that√¢Äù √¢Äúhow do you infer this
from that√¢Äù





 it might be objected to me that the word
proof is also frequently applied to inductive ar
gument but this is only the case when it is in

tended to show that the value of the inference
amounts to moral certainty and then induction
is considered as equivalent to and spoken of as
being the same as deduction and i should not

think that the word infer could ever be aptly ap
plied to mathematical demonstration

it appears to me also that the words inference
and proof cannot strictly be opposed to each other
if the proof and the conclusion are the two por
tions of a deductive argument the reason and

the inference may be considered as the corre
sponding portion of arguments in general or of
the inductive species in particular
the next section of this third chapter is headed


√¢Äúinvestigator and advocate√¢Äù and the distinc
tion between the two is founded upon that which
had been established between inferring and

proving but it appears to me that both these
operations may be necessary both to the investi
gator and the advocate

an investigator i



 ch x 

should say is he who combines experiment
observation and ratiocination with a view to
clearing up any doubt he may entertain upon

any subject or to the adding to the stock of
information which he may possess with regard
to it

an advocate is he who endeavours to

prove to another person a proposition true gr
false of which he himself has no doubt or affects

to have no doubt an advocate may be an in
vestigator the investigator ceases to be such
when he puts on the advocate
the word investigator however is only
given in the marginal title of the section in
question in the text the word philosopher is
substituted a word which cannot fail to throw
 more or less of obscurity over every topic in
which it is suffered to intrude the term phi


 

 

losophy has ever been strangely ill used from
its first coining by the ancient greeks to the

present day scarcely may there be found two
authors who agree upon its meaning

it has

sometimes been extended to the designation of
the pursuit of science in the aggregate and often
restricted to that of particular branches it has
been exclusively applied to various ethical

noological or physical studies and here the



induction

philosophers field is confined to the √¢Äúcombin
ing and selecting known facts for giving
conclusions implied in the premises√¢Äù to the
√¢Äúmakinglogical discoveries√¢Äù or in a word
to mere syllogistic reasoning 

 in the next page however our philosophers
duties are again enlarged the whole field of
observation and experiment is now allotted to
him for exercise he is restricted only as to the
mode in which he is to make use of his ratiocina

tive faculties he is to draw conclusions from his

observations but he must not seek for argu
ments in support of any fact for this is the

advocates or rhetorician√¢Äôs province are these
two functions as distinct as drwhately conceives
them to be and might we not from the data
before us draw up the following syllogism
the philosopher infers the advocate proves p 
he who infers proves and he who proves infers p 
therefore 



the philosopher is an advocate that is the two words are
synonymous

rhetorician a term incidentally introduced

upon this occasion as a sort of synonym to advo
cate appears to call for a few words in explana

tion of its import a rhetorician according to



ch x



my view of the matter is the advocate who seeks
to convince not by logical argument but by
influencing the affections and passions the
ideas he seeks to convey are more generally false
than true his arguments more frequently falla
cious than logical rhetoric is an art of which
the practice is useful when a truth is to be im
pressed upon intellects too narrow for the ready
conception of logical arguments√¢Äîwhen the dif
fusion of a false idea may happen to be necessary
for any purpose of general utility√¢Äîor for the
purpose of giving amusement when the subject
is of so little importance that its truth or falsity

matters not

beyond this rhetoric is ever a

baneful art and the grand object of the logician
is to guard against its influence and to counter
act its evil effects



the remaining chapter of this dissertation
on the province of reasoning relates to verbal
and real questions its chief object appears to
be to shew the importance of definition or rather

exposition in general without which it is shewn
that no logical argument can be carried on

this importance of exposition might have been
still more generalized and might perhaps be

exemplified were it worth the labour in more



induction

than one instance where a certain degree of ob
scurity prevails over this very chapter of the ele
ments over the whole of the appendix and the
greater number of the professed definitions in
the index but it would probably exhaust the

readers patience and that to little purpose were
i to pursue this investigation any further i shall
therefore proceed immediately to the theory of
fallacies

ing of the subject i must attempt the classifica

tion and exposition of the principal fallacies
according to my own ideas in this operation

i

shall be in some measure guided by the above

mentioned book of fallacies but the method

there adopted must for the present purpose be
considerably modified only one part of the
field that of political fallacies was there at

tended to and that with a view to political and
particularly to parliamentary argument the
object being different on the present occasion
the source of division will also be different
fallacies must now be considered in a more

general point of view the whole field should be
 √¢Äúwe propose to take a logical view of the subject


referring the different fallacies to the most convenient heads

and giving a scientific analysis of the procedure which takes

place in each√¢Äù elements p 

either i ammuch mistaken

or by a logical vien is here meant

much ratiocination and here at last drwhatelys view agrees
with mine as to the extent to which the field of logic is to
be carried notwithstanding the restricted limits he has
hitherto been repeatedly assigning to it

embraced and the division carried on as far as
it is applicable to arguments in general without
reference to any particular subject

this is an

undertaking for which i certainly do not feel that
competency which would be desirable but as

without it a great blank would be left in the
science of logic i shall endeavour to exhibit
generally my views leaving ulterior details for

the more comprehensive work i am preparing

before i proceed to the division of the genus
fallacies i must observe that there may be a
number of assertions of which the fallsity is so

very evident that it is useless to exhibit them in
the character of fallacies there being no possi
bility of any persons being led astray by them
as for ex if we were to assert that a thing which

is is not and one great error of logicians ap
pears to be that after defining a fallacy √¢Äúan
argument which appears to prove a question

which is not fair or true√¢Äù they give as examples
of fallacies arguments or rather puns which
can never in this sense appear to be correct 
that is can never convey to any mind any degree
of belief of the false assertion adduced who
will ever

believe for instance that √¢Äúa river has





ch

xi

feet because it runs√¢Äù or that √¢Äúa constellation

barks because it is a dog√¢Äù
fallacies may in general be referred to one of
the two following classes



 fallacies arising from the manner in which

the ideas are communicated or fallacies of ex
pression





 fallacies arising from the nature of the
ideas themselves or fallacious ideas
this first division of fallacies answers in some

measure to the common one into fallacia in
dictione and extra dictionem but i have given a

somewhat greater extent to the former class
than that which is usually ascribed to it as i in

clude in it nearly the whole of dr whatelys

semilogical

fallacies c as will presently be
seen in my examination of his system
 
fallacies of expression have place when the
learner fails to entertain a clear correct and com
plete idea of the arguments or propositions com

paliter significat ut si probetur aliquod coeleste sidus esse

fallacies

municated to him by the teacher that defect

in the operation of communication which is the

cause of these fallacies is termed misexpression
when the fault is considered as lying on the part
of the teacher and misconception when on that
of the learner 

defective

expression

may be generally re

ferred to one of the three heads of ambiguity

obscurity and error of expression



i ambiguity of expression has place when a
word may be understood by the learner in either

of two or more different senses

such ambi

guity becomes a source of fallacy when amongst
these several meanings the learner is induced
by chance or from any other cause to adopt
a different one from that which the teacher had
in view







this definition of ambiguity will be found to
be much more limited than that which is usually
given by logicians all homonymous terms

that is all those which may happen in the same

or in different circumstances to designate two or
 it should be remembered that by the word teacher is

here to be understood he who makes the communication
who utters the proposition or argument by the word learner
he to whom it is addressed



ch

xi

more different objects are by them included

amongst ambiguous terms but i should
make use of the latter denomination only in the

cases where there is room for hesitation on the
learner√¢Äôs part as to which sense he should adopt

and there are a great number of instances where
it is impossible he should be mistaken as to the
intended import of a homonymous term thus
in the example already quoted from saunderson
of a river running though √¢Äúrunning√¢Äù has ano
ther sense than that of √¢Äúflowing√¢Äù in which it is
here used yet to no one would the idea occur
that it was that other sense which was here
meant√¢Äîto no one would this homonymous word

appear in the smallest degree ambiguous
ambiguity may be seated in words alone or
in sentences when it is in the words alone the
fallacies arising from this source may be termed

fallacies of equivocation when it is the sentence
that is ambiguous the corresponding fallacies

are those of amphibology
 as examples of ambiguous terms pro
ducing fallacious conception we may refer to the
 √¢Äúfallacia aequivocationis sive homonymia est quando

vox aliqua simplex aliter atque aliter accipitur in argumenta
tione√¢Äù saunderson√¢Äôs logic p 

fallaces



observations i have made in preceding chapters
with regard to the double meanings of the words
√¢Äúdistributed√¢Äù √¢Äúnecessary√¢Äù √¢Äúparticular√¢Äù √¢Äúdis
course√¢Äù √¢Äúnew truth√¢Äù c as used by dr
whately and other logicians in my above
mentioned √¢Äúessai sur la nomenclature et la

classification√¢Äù c i pointed out the ambiguity
of the words √¢Äúphysic√¢Äù √¢Äúphysics√¢Äù c in seve
ral of their various conjugates in french and

english√¢Äîapplied as they are sometimes to me
dicinal science sometimes to somatology in
general sometimes to technological science
in the same work may be seen several other in
stances of ambiguous and obscure general deno

minations of arts and sciences
another cause of ambiguity in terms is de
rived from the diversity of import which custom
has often ascribed to paronymous words a

conjugate is naturally supposed to correspond in
import to its root and when this is not the case

it will always take some time for the learner to
dismiss the original meaning from his mind

ambiguity in conjunctions and other words
by which terms and propositions are connected

is strikingly exemplified in the instance of the
 see hereafter fallacies of paronymity
q 



ch

xi

word or in almost all european languages this
conjunction may express either synonymity or

alternation and often in a manner in which the
learner is much puzzled as to which of the two

is to be understood

the word either becomes

in some degree ambiguous from its occasional
modern use as a synomyn to both or to each

the ambiguity of some causal conjunctions has
been exemplified by dr whately see above p
 and elements p the present tense of
the verb is in many cases ambiguous as it is
sometimes used indefinitely that is to denote the
action without

any regard to time as animals live

eat 

sometimes it is definitely applied to the
present time as he is in london
 ambiguity in sentences or amphibology

and



may arise from miscollocation or from the double

meanings of grammatical inflections
 ambiguity from miscollocation has place
when by a defect in the order in which the
 inflections are the modifications in words by which are
expressed certain grammatical relations such as time mood 
number gender case c as for ex √¢Äúrego reri√¢Äù √¢Äúwrite

wrote√¢Äù c

languages are said to be more or less inflected

according to the proportion of such relations expressed by 
modifications in the words themselves as compared to those
which are expressed by separate auxiliary words

falla cies



component parts of a portion of discourse are ex
hibited it remains uncertain to which of two

terms or propositions a clause a parenthesis or
a relative pronoun or other term should be re
ferred various examples of this species of am

phibology may be seen in dr whately√¢Äôs ele
ments p note
grammatical amphibology will of course be
found much more common in the more inflected

languages than in the english

the following

example however is given by dr whately
√¢Äúthe duke yet lives that henry shall depose√¢Äù
this as well as other species of ambiguity was

much practised by ancient priests to save the
credit of their oracles as in the instance of the

celebrated oracle given to pyrrhus at delphi

√¢Äúaio te eacide romanos vincere posse√¢Äù here
either of the terms √¢Äúte√¢Äù and √¢Äúromanos√¢Äù may

be taken either as agent or patient both of these
grammatical relations being expressed by the
accusative case



another example of amphibology is that

of negative propositions in which the word

not is the sign of negation as for ex i shall not
speak because he desires it may signify either
that it is not because he desires it that i shall





ch xi

speak or that his desiring me to speak is my
reason for not doing so

ii obscurity of

expression has place where
the teacher√¢Äôs propositions or arguments fail in

any degree to convey positive exact or distinct
ideas to the learner√¢Äôs mind it is productive of
fallacy when the learner ascribing perhaps his
defective conception to his own want of

ability

or of application adopts the teacher√¢Äôs proposi
tions and conclusions taking for granted their
respective connections and dependence or what

ever else there may be that he cannot clearly
comprehend

if the reader seeks for examples

of obscurity he has only to open the first
german metaphysical treatise ancient or mo
dern which he may lay his hands upon and he

will probably not have perused many pages
before he finds them replete with obscurity in

every shape and their power of producing fallacy
is amply proved by theextraordinary faculty which
enables these same germans after having be
wildered their senses during the perusal of two
or three octavos to come to such a conclusion as

the following √¢Äúin all plants there is but one

organ the root leaves petals seeds c c

are all the same thing√¢Äîor were all originally





fall acies

exactly similar but have only been modified in

order to perform their different functions√¢Äù an
assertion which i have often heard seriously ar
gued by botanists of the german school other
wise clever and intelligent

an obscure expression is either vague or con
fused

in the former case it is chiefly the nature

of the import of the words that is productive of 
obscurity confusedness usually arises from their
collocation

 wague nomenclature may be exemplified in

the instance of the words philosophy reasoning
c and in that of a great number of general

ethical terms virtue vice charity faith c
on these occasions the teacher may perhaps en
tertain in his own mind exact and distinct cor
respondent ideas yet to the learner they will

always appear more or less vague unless accom
panied by precise and repeated exposition thus
it is that these words by their obscurity must
produce more or less of fallacy in all arguments
in which they are introduced



 confusedness of expression is often observed
in the writings of certain authors whose long
winded arguments grow as it were one out
of the other in one neverending sentence and

ch x



are accompanied and intersected with so many
incidental and often irrelevant clauses that 

before the reader has reached a full stop he
has completely forgotten the point whence he 

started and the object of the discourse as

well as the respective connection of its compo
nent parts an over attention to general rhetori
cal elegance and the contrary efforts to sacrifice
every thing to the preciseness of each individual
proposition as for ex in our legal and statutelan
guage may be alike productive of general confu
sedness this defect may also originate in a want
of ability on the author√¢Äôs part of embracing the
whole of his subject at once and from his giving
way to that natural propensity of the human mind

to wander in its thoughts from one subject to an
other as suggested to his memory by any acciden

tal apropos see hereafter fallacies of artful
diversion

iii error of expression has place when a
different idea is conceived by the learner from



that which was intended to have been expressed
by the teacher though at the same time each
may in his own mind have attached a clear and

distinct idea to the expression in question
error of expression with regard to names of 

fall acies



real entities seems little worth mentioning as a
source of fallacy as in such cases it does not
proceed from inattention on the part of the
teacher but chiefly from mistake or ignorance
and in that case the learner√¢Äôs misconception is
owing to his not having duly weighed the value
of the teacher√¢Äôs testimony and the fallacy exem

plified is referrible to the head of defective evi
dence if a man calls a horse a dog or a book
a table through ignorance his testimony is de

fective by the erroneousness of operation of his in
tellectual faculties if he wilfully misuses any such
names of real entities his moral dispositions are de

fective√¢Äîhe tells a lie see in the preceding chap
ter what has been said on the value of evidence
and hereafter the fallacies of defective evidence

it is then to the misuse of fiction that falla

cies of erroneous expression must be attributed
fiction it has already been shown is absolutely

necessary in all discourse and thatto suchadegree
that it is scarcely possible on all occasions to guard
against fallacy from this cause the connection
between a fictitious entity and its type is in most

cases so vague and uncertain that to ensure cor
rect conception it would require an exact defi

nition of the meaning intended to be attached to



chi

xi

the name of every fictitious entity on the part of
every succeeding author this however cannot
have place on account of the diffuseness which
would be the result every author therefore

selects for exposition such terms only as he con
siders at the same time as the most important
and the most liable to misconception but these
very terms may be such as appear to be the
plainest to his readers and there may be many
others upon which his whole arguments may
rest that may be taken in an entirely different
sense from that which he had in view and thus
convert a whole treatise into absolute nonsense

when a reader is puzzled with his author√¢Äôs ar
guments his first attention should be directed
to the meaning to be attached to the words and
in order to facilitate on all occasions the ascer

taining the correctness of the ideas conveyed no
author whose object is perspicuity and instruc
tion should fear the multiplication of expositions
of terms

for the exemplification of fallacies of fiction

by which name we may designate such as arise
from erroneous expression as above limited we
may refer to that head the following species

 ascribing reality to a fictitious entity



fall acies

this is a very common source of error and is
much used by rhetoricians all fallacies in
ethical and physiological arguments derived
from the personification of reason nature c
may be referred to this head
 assuming that the connection between
two fictitious entities is the same as the corre

sponding connection between real entities that
is as the real connection designated by the
same name thus when we say that a genus
contains so many species we do not represent to

ourselves that a genus is a receptacle which would
still remain though empty if all those species
were taken away from it but that it consists of
or is divided into so many species and yet if
it be kept in mind that figurative expressions
must not be argued upon in their real sense
there appears to be no great inconvenience in
adopting the common expression that √¢Äúa genus
contains its species√¢Äù
 ascribing reality to a collective entity
that is the supposing that a common name is
the name of some one really existing object
distinct of course from every individual object
contained in the collective entity in question
the errors arising from this source are frequently




ch xi

mentioned by dr whately p p c
and have also been adverted to in the course of the

preceding pages of this outline 
 mistaking the extent of the name of a col
lective entity when a generic term is made
use of by the teacher to designate one particular
species of the genus the only species perhaps

which occurs to him at the moment or at any
rate that which appears to him the most import
ant the species par excellence√¢Äîand when the

learner at the same time applies that same term
to the whole genus or to some other of its spe
cies his conception is erroneous he is mistaken
as to the extent which the teacher intended to as

cribe to the term in question the example
given by dr whately of the word faith em
ployed by christians to denote the christian
faith by mussulmen to denote the mahometan
c belongs to the present species of fallacy

provided the double meaning be considered as
seated in the generic word faith but i cannot
agree with this author in considering the word
faith as having √¢Äúnot two different senses but

two different applications√¢Äù if the √¢Äúchristian
faith√¢Äù and the √¢Äúmahometan faith√¢Äù be both de

signated by the same name these two entities



fallacies



being different from one another that name
which is common to both must surely be con

sidered as having two different senses

√¢Äúa

word having a particular sense√¢Äù and √¢Äúa name

being applied to a particular object√¢Äù are i
should think but two modes of expressing the
same idea

 an error closely allied to the preceding
is the mistaking the object to which a relative
 √¢Äúthe elliptical character of ordinary discourse causes
many terms to become practically ambiguous which yet are
not themselves employed in different senses but with different
applications which are understood thus √¢Äòthe faith would
be used by a christian writer to denote the christian faith
and by a mussulman the mahometan yet the word faith

has not in these cases of itself two different significations
so x√£≥croi √¢Äúelect or √¢Äúchosen is sometimes applied to such
as are √¢Äúchosen to certain privileges and advantages as the
israelites were though they were overthrown in the wilder

ness for their disobedience and as all

christians are fre

quently called in the new testament sometimes again to
those who are √¢Äúchosen as fit to receive a final renard having
made a right use of those advantages as when our lord says
√¢Äòmany are called but few chosen√¢Äô√¢Äù elements p 
in the latter example the generic term √¢Äúchosen√¢Äù is em

ployed in the first instance to designate the species √¢Äúchosen
for certain privileges and advantages√¢Äù afterwards to denote
the species √¢Äú chosen for a final reward√¢Äù

expression refers as for ex if two adversaries
were to discuss the merits of any particular
person first designated by both parties by some
such expression as √¢Äúthe man who was there√¢Äù
c and were each to have in view some different
man but this error is comparatively unimport
ant as being rarely exemplified and producing
in general but a momentary fallacy
 fallacies of paronymity√¢Äîthe assuming that
the difference in sense of paronymous words

corresponds to the modifications given by the
conjugation
paronymous words taking the term in its
most general sense are all those which are
derived from the same root

words are derived

from a root when an entity being designated by
any name other words either names of entities

or abbreviative words are formed by modifica
tions in that name or root

the words so formed

are said to be conjugates of their root or of one
√¢Äòanother

when these modifications in sense so desig
nated are reducible to regular classes and are
moreover applicable to all words of the same

part of speech the relations between the conju
gates are termed grammatical relations and the



fall acies



conjugates are more especially denominated in
jlections such are those of case number and
gender as applied to the noun substantive or

adjective of degree as applied to the adjective of
voice mood tense number person and gender
as applied to the verb c in the case of these
grammatical conjugates thereis seldom anyaltera
tion in the sense of the root but that which is

designated by the inflection it is seldom there
fore that any fallacy is to be apprehended from
their use

but in regard to those less regular conjugates
which are more particularly termed paronymous
words and which belong either to different parts

of speech as for ex actor to act active actively
c or to different classes of words in the same

part of speech as governor the governed go
vernment c the root often undergoes some
modification in sense besides that which is indi

cated by the conjugation

the neglecting to

take these modifications into account is the

source of the present fallacy of paronymity
which answers to that one termed by dr

whately √¢Äúfallacia figurae dictionis√¢Äù elements
p 

in the example he gives of the words

project and projector the former word designates



ch xi

the result of an operation the latter the apparently
corresponding operator but in fact the word pro
jector implies moreover an expression of vitupe
ration which project does not the use which dr
whately appears to have made in his introduc
tion of the words reason and reasoning may fur
nish another example of this species of fallacy f
 the fallacies of etymology are closely allied
to the preceding as shewn by dr whately p
 they appear indeed to refer only to those
 see above ch ii p 
 the distinction between grammatical and other conju
gates is very vague and may perhaps be said only to consist
in the greater regularity of the former that is to say that
grammatical conjugates more rarely differ otherwise than as
expressed by the inflection yet this is not always the case

as for ex in the english future tense √¢Äúi shall go√¢Äù merely
indicates futurity √¢Äúyou shall go√¢Äù intimates a command


so likewise √¢Äúyou will go√¢Äù simply expresses futurity and
√¢Äúi will go√¢Äù implies determination the distinctive character

given in the text that grammatical conjugates are applicable
to all words of the same part of speech is only relatively

speaking for then comes the question as to what is and
what is not to be considered as a separate verb substantive
c √¢Äúregor√¢Äù is commonly said to be√¢Äînot a separate verb√¢Äîbut
the passive of √¢Äúrego√¢Äù and yet √¢Äúgovernor√¢Äù and √¢Äúthe go
verned√¢Äù are said to be substantives distinct from √¢Äú govern

mentnot grammatical inflections of this substantive

fall acies



cases of fallacious paronymity where the conju
gates are the more remote in sense or in form√¢Äî
see for examples whatelys elements p 
 these several fallacies of expression will be
found to be very convenient instruments in the
hands of the sophist for the fallacious reduction
of arguments that is for the reduction of a fal
lacious argument to a form approaching more or
less to the syllogism at the same time altering
imperceptibly the propositions of which it may
consist so as to make it produce conviction in
his adversary√¢Äôs mind in the instance of any of
the fallacious arguments which i have pointed
out as observable in the course of dr whately√¢Äôs
elements it might not perhaps be found diffi
cult to reduce them apparently to correct syllo
gisms by means of a small degree of ingenuity

in profiting of double meanings of terms of the
noncorrespondence in sense of paronymous
words c



returning now to fallacious ideas the second
general division of fallacies and which i have
said to be such as √¢Äúarise from the nature of the

ideas themselves√¢Äù they may be generally re
ferred to the following heads
i fictitious argument
r



ch

xi

ii defective argument
iii irrelevant

argument

these classes may not perhaps be found to
be so distinct in some of their details as might be
wished but in every deceptive argument the
fallacies exemplified are usually so numerous
and so intimately blended together that it be
comes a very difficult operation to reduce them to
regular and distinct heads in the following enu
meration my object is chiefly to exhibit the most
important and most common modes in which

more or less of erroneous conviction is produced
i do not therefore give this list of fallacies as
complete and with regard to their arrangement
i have merely endeavoured to group together
those which appear to bear the greatest analogy
to one another in order that they may be the
more easily retained in the mind and glanced
over when it is wished for the purpose of refu
tation to discover what particular fallacy has
been made use of in an adversary√¢Äôs argument

i a fictitious argument is that which elicits
no fact or assertion other than such as were

expressed in the propositions from whence the

sophist has started to this head may be referred
the following fallacies

fall acies



 petitio principii or begging the question
that is to say assuming in the premises the very
thing you wish to prove this may be in some
measure productive of fallacy by the mere sub
stituting in the premises synonymous terms for
those made use of in the conclusion as in the

example given in the book of fallacies √¢Äúwhy
does opium produce sleep because it is sopo
riferous√¢Äù or in that given by dr whately √¢Äúto
allow every man an unbounded freedom of
speech must always be on the whole advan
tageous to the state for it is highly conducive

to the interest of the community that each in
dividual should enjoy a liberty perfectly un

limited of expressing his sentiments√¢Äù but
petitio principii is a much more efficient fallacy
when the fact to be proved is indirectly assumed
in the premises by means of some term which
implies it but does not so openly assert it as
for ex if it were argued that √¢Äúthis action was
a most

virtuous

one therefore the man who

performed it deserves to be highly commended
for it√¢Äù

here virtue and that which deserves to

be commended are in fact two names for one

and the same thing

one mode of disguising the concluding as
r 



ch

xi

sertion in the premises is by exhibiting it in the

conditional form as if it were the intention of
the arguer to prove it and after more or less
verbiage by concluding with the same assertion
given in a positive form but without its having
been supported by any thing but the original
conditional assumption in this instance petitio

principii is combined with artful diversion
i do not comprehend under the petitio
principii all the fallacies arising from the ques

tionbegging appellatives of the book of fallacies
part iv ch i as they appear to me to be
referrible in some cases to confusion of ideas
in others to fallacious qualifications
 arguing in a circle this fallacy has
place when a conclusion is deduced from pre
mises which have themselves been proved by
means of the assumption of the proposition
which forms the conclusion in question see
the example relating to gravitation c in dr
whately√¢Äôs elements p 




ii defective argument√¢Äîreferring of course
to inductive arguments in particular as the fal

lacies of expression relate rather to the syllogism
the different sources of fallacy exemplified in a
defective argument must correspond in some

fallacies



measure to the different considerations upon
which the validity of a sound one has been said
to depend and may therefore be distributed in
a manner analogous to that in which these con

siderations have been classed under three gene
ral heads

 defective evidence

tive generalization

 defec

 defective application

 defective evidence√¢Äîbecomes a source of

fallacy when the sophist induces his opponent to

neglect to gloss over or to misconstrue any of
those elements of evidence referred in the last

chapter to the heads of personal observation

testimony and previous induction i shall not
repeat what i have said in the exposition of these

elements in my preceding chapter but shall
merely add a few examples of the most common
fallacies of evidence

 fallacies of personal observation√¢Äîare

produced when physical facts or phenomena
are so exhibited or commented upon as to pro
duce inattentive or even directly erroneous ob
servation

for some particular purpose been persuaded to

believe that they actually saw or heard spectres

ples of the present species of fallacy jugglers√¢Äô
tricks theatrical illusions c not producing
belief in the results exhibited are not fallacies

but bear the same relation to the present class
which jests and puns bear to fallacies of ex
pression
 fallacies of testimony√¢Äîare the effect 
either of an artful misrepresentation or colour
ing of wellattested facts or of endeavours to
depreciate or to enhance the moral or intellec
tual credibility of the attesting witnesses no
example can illustrate this class of fallacies in
a more striking manner than that of the judge 
who after summing up a case so as to pro
duce in the minds of the whole audience a con 

viction of the justice of the plaintiff√¢Äôs demands
by clear and incontrovertible proof apparently
resulting from the testimony shifted his ground 
and recommencing his expos√£© produced from

the very same evidence an equally convincing
statement of the defendant√¢Äôs right the varia
tions in the inferences drawn by adverse his

fallacies





torians from the same series of events are ad
ditional proofs of the repeated occurrence the
facility in practice and the difficulty of detection
of fallacies of testimony

a very common mode of misrepresenting
wellattested facts is by the gratuitous appli

cation of fallacious epithets that is by the
giving to facts or to objects epithets expressive
of some qualifications ascribed to them for the
purpose of argument√¢Äînot because the objects
are really supposed to be possessed of such quali
fications this fallacy is chiefly applicable to
ethical subjects and comprehends most of mr

benthams questionbegging appellatives book
of fallacies p his impostor terms p 
matchless constitution p glorious revolu
tion p and perhaps the paradovical asser
tions contained in part iv chapter x of the
same work

to the head of fallacies of testimony belongs
also that which dr whately has defined and

exemplified elements p under the name
of fallacy of references in france where it is
the custom to give the authority and rationale

is often found convenient to support an unjust

arr√£©t√£© by reference to laws and regulations which
to the vulgar eye may exhibit in the title at
least some distant analogy to the case in point
but which upon investigation are discovered to

be totally irrelevant

considered in another

point of view this example might also be re
ferred to the head of irrelevant argument with

which defective testimony is closely connected
with regard to the √¢Äúundue assumption of
premises√¢Äù in general that is to the assertion of
individual facts not sufficiently well attested no
general rules can be given as to what is or is
not sufficiently well attested this must depend
in each individual case not only on the general
value of the elements of evidence but upon the
nature of the object in view and on the judg
ment of the person to whom the argument is

 undue generalization this applies to
inductive generalization and has place when
constancy is ascribed to a fact from insufficient
grounds as for ex when from one individual act
a habit or custom is inferred

thus if a man

upon some one occasion perhaps under some
extraordinary temptation had appropriated to
himself some property not belonging to him and
if he were to be set down as an habitual thief
and ejected from society without enquiring into
other circumstances of his character or if a tra

veller were to give a general account of the cha
racter manners and customs of the nations he

visited from one or two individual observations

in the ideas that is the confounding together en
tities which are different in their nature
one of the most common of these fallacies of

confusion is that which has been called non causa

pro causa or the mistaking for the cause that
which is not the cause

thus an obstacle is

mistaken for the cause when the system of edu

cation pursued in our universities is represented
as the cause of useful national learning book of
fallacies p so it has frequently been an
nounced that the destruction of all government
would be productive of perfect individual liberty
when in fact it is the greatest obstacle to it
the effect may also be mistaken for the
cause as for instance when the turks are ex

cused for their illtreatment of the greeks by
representing it as the natural effect of the de
pravity of these their subjects when it is rather

this tyrannical treatment the greeks meet with
from their oppressors that is the cause of their
depravity

observed that the denomination fallacies of con

subject has been treated of with a degree of
detail which renders useless any further investiga

tion on the present occasion among the species
of fallacious authority we may enumerate the
following
 appeal to the wisdom of our ancestors √¢Äì
the arguing in favour of the introduction or con

tinuance of any measure because it was prac

times inhabited the country of those who are

discussing it√¢Äîthese practices and opinions being

produced in modern revolutions the present
fallacy is the opposite defect to the preceding
one it may not be so generally exemplified nor
so pernicious in its results as the √¢Äúappeal to

are instances when its influence is very prejudi

class of fallacies the sophist endeavours to di

part iii ch 
having thus given a general outline of a

system of classification of these instruments of
deception i must refer to mr bentham√¢Äôs book
of fallacies for any further investigation which



ch

xi

may be required of fallacies in general of their
causes and mischiefs of the use of their exposure

and of the different degrees of fallacy of which
the same argument is susceptible according to
the cases to which it is applied i have only to

observe on the present occasion that many of the
propositions quoted in the course of the preced
ing pages as examples of fallacious arguments

may in some instances become perfectly fair and
conclusive

if for example the blind observ

ance of the laws and opinions of our ancestors

and a universal confidence in their

wisdom are

practically pernicious and therefore theoreti
cally fallacious yet there are certainly instances
of our ancestors having known better than our
selves on particular points the fallacy lies in

the general assumption of the proposition and

the contradictory assertion if taken universally
would also be fallacious though in a much
smaller degree
referring now to the view dr whately has
taken of the subject we perceive that he first

distributes fallacies into three classes the purely
logical the semilogical and the nonlogical
purely logical fallacies are defined to be

those which are exhibited in the form only of the

fall acies





expression without any regard to the meaning
of the terms these terms being supposed to be



exactly defined and free from any ambiguity or
obscurity in the same manner as no regard is
to be had to the sense the argument must be
supposed to have been also previously reduced

to a syllogistic form as this operation cannot be
performed √¢Äúwithout any regard to the sense√¢Äù
but when the argument is thus reduced will
not any defect in form be so very apparent to

any one whose mind is at all capable of any de
duction as to render it useless to speak of such

defects as fallacies that is as such as cause the

argument to be apparently decisive of a false
conclusion take for instance the example
√¢Äúwhatever is universally believed must be true
the existence of a god is not universally believed

therefore it is not true√¢Äù elements p 
this fallacious argument is certainly not yet re
duced to a syllogistic form for we have in one pre
miss a substantive term whatever is universallybe
lieved and an adjective one true in the second

a different substantive and adjective √¢Äúexistence

of a god√¢Äù and √¢Äúuniversally believed√¢Äù and in
the conclusion a pronoun and the adjective term



ch

xi

of the first premiss√¢Äîin all five terms and there
fore no syllogism the pronoun it is true
might be reckoned as the same as the noun which
it represents but even then we have one term
too many for i do not see how an adjective ex
pression can be converted into an equivalent
substantive one without any regard to the sense

√¢Äînor can it perhaps be done without a very
close attention to the meaning as may be seen in
dr whatelys examples of the fallacia figurae
dictionis p 

let us now suppose all these √¢Äúnonlogical√¢Äù
operations performed and the above argument
reduced to a √¢Äúpure syllogism containing only
three terms√¢Äù and to be more certain of disre

garding the sense of the terms let us substitute
unmeaning symbols we have √¢Äúevery x is a y
z is not an x therefore z is not a y√¢Äù

who is

there who would admit of such reasoning how

can this √¢Äúunsound mode of arguing√¢Äù √¢Äúappear
to demand our conviction and to be decisive of
the question in hand when in fairness it is
not√¢Äù





 √¢Äúevery syllogism has three and only three tems
ments p 

ele

fall acies



it may be objected that when this argument
is involved in a complicated labyrinth of words

it may amount to a fallacy but then that fallacy

does not rest in the form but in the ambiguity
or obscurity and particularly in the confusedness
of the expression and thence of the sense con
veyed in that expression and in so far as this
is the case the fallacy belongs to other heads
dr whately admits that this first division is not
distinct that fallacies may frequently be referred
to either of its condivident members a defect

which must be more or less observable in any
classification of these complicated instruments of

deception but in the present instance the dis
tinction will be found to be eminently vague
and moreover useless if it be considered that

any defect in a pure syllogism is so obvious as not
to be worth designating a fallacy and that when
the argument is not in its simplest form the fal

lacy is always referrible to the same authors se
milogical or to his nonlogical fallacies
 i have thought it necessary to verify these observations
in the example of that species only which dr whately has
termed illicit process but they will be found to be equally
applicable to any of his other purely logical fallacies as it will

appear evident by reducing them to the syllogistic form thus



ch xi

it is for these reasons that in my classifica
tion of fallacies i have entirely omitted those
which dr whately calls √¢Äúpurely logical√¢Äù let

us now proceed to his semilogical fallacies which
he defines to be √¢Äúall the cases of ambiguous
middle except its nondistribution√¢Äù elements
p 
in the next page he gives as a reason for call
ing these fallacies semilogical that here logic
teaches us not how to find the fallacy but only
where to search for it and on what principles to
condemn it but take the example √¢Äúevery

x is a y every y is a z therefore every x is a
z√¢Äù if logic is nothing more than syllogistic
reasoning it can detect no fallacy in this argu

ment which answers perfectly to the rules of
syllogism now suppose we are told that there
is here a concealed fallacy does such √¢Äúlogic√¢Äù
tell us that it must rest in the ambiguity of the
mean y may it not be in the obscurity of x or
for example the undistributed middle rather a singular expres
sion in the english language every x is a y some y√¢Äôs are
z√¢Äôs therefore every x is a z√¢Äîor the syllogisms which √¢Äúhave

palpably more than three terms√¢Äù every a is a b every c is a
d therefore every a is a d would scarcely produce belief in
their respective conclusions


fall acies



of z or in the ambiguity of either x or z
these terms meaning one thing in the premiss
another in the conclusion or in the falsity of
either of the assertions 

if therefore dr

whately√¢Äôs limitation of the field of logic be
adopted that science does not appear to be en
titled even to the share here ascribed to it in the

detection of √¢Äúambiguous middle √¢Äù it has been
shewn that the fallacies called purely logical are
no fallacies at all the consequence is that logic
thus restricted is totally unconnected with the
exposure of any fallacies

however the author himself now departs a
little from the system of rigorous exclusion he
has hitherto pursued i have already observed
that in p he calls classification and analysis
√¢Äúthe taking a logical view√¢Äù again in p 

he speaks of logical analysis and on the present
occasion p he positively admits that gene
ral rules for definition belong to logic let him
but admit that the science includes also general
rules for induction and we are perfectly agreed
as to the extent of its field

the passage i have just alluded to is too
strongly in support of my opinion for me to re
frain from quoting it



ch

xi

√¢Äúit has been made a bitter subject of com
plaint against logic that it presupposes the most

difficult point to be already accomplished viz
the sense of the terms to be ascertainedthe

objection is peculiarly absurd when urged against

logic because the object which it is blamed for
not accomplishing cannot possibly be within the

province of any one art whatever is it indeed
possible or conceivable that there should be any
method science or system that should enable
one to know the full and exact meaning of every
term in existence

the utmost that can be

done is to give some general rules that may assist
us in this work√¢Äù



the giving general rules is all i require of
logic and here i agree with the author of the

elements but i leave it for the reader to judge
 i certainly admit that all this is not the province of lo
gic but i should be tempted to ask in reply whether it be
not the professed object of a dictionary this object is not
in general attained so well as it might be wished but it is as
easy to conceive a good expositive dictionary as a good scien
tific treatise or theory in order to know the full and exact
meaning of a term there is no occasion to treat of all the dif

ferent properties of the idea it represents nor of the relations
of this idea with others

how far he is right when he adds √¢Äúwhich is done
in the two first parts of logic√¢Äù meaning proba

bly in his elements where the section on defi
nition for instance may perhaps have been shown
in a preceding chapter to be somewhat inade
quate for the purpose

but to return to ambiguous middle on the
occasion of which this digression has been sug

gested this fallacy or rather source of fallacy

which might be more appropriately denominated
ambiguity in the mean term belongs to the head

of ambiguity in terms of my arrangement
and i see no reason for making a separate class
of those cases where the ambiguity rests in the
mean term not in the extremes much less for

attaching more importance to ambiguity in this
case than in any other as it may if any thing be
generally speaking easier of detection than that
of the extremes

under the head of ambiguous middle are
classed√¢Äî

defined nor exemplified but meaning i pre
sume that which has place when a word is taken

sense in the other i have as above adopted this

name but i have applied it to all cases where a
word forming part of an argument may be un
derstood in more than one sense it is in general
of all fallacies the easiest to detect and therefore
the least important

 fallacia figurae dictionis p where
paronymous words are erroneously supposed to
have a correspondent meaning

this i have re

ferred under the name of fallacy of paronymity
to the head of fallacies of fiction to which it
appears to me to belong rather than to the head
of fallacies arising from ambiguity
 fallacia figurae dictionis when resting in
other terms than the mean p am

biguity in other terms than the mean p 
do these two fallacies belong to ambiguous mid
dle and if not is there any use in thus classing
fallacious expression according to the terms in
which it rests

 fallacy of etymology p i have said
that this is a modification of fallacious paronymity
differing only inasmuch as the conjugates in the
present instance are more remote from one another
in sense and in form the fallacy is thereby more

apparent and therefore less important
 fallacy of interrogations p 


fall acies



this does not appear to me to differ from the
ordinary fallacy of equivocation otherwise than

by the form in which the argument is expressed
and by the slight degree of obscurity which is

thereby added to it the proposition to be proved
is in the present instance given as an interroga
tion and the fallacy lies in the supposed answer
not in the question itself dr whately√¢Äôs first ex

of very small importance as it does not appear
that to any one acquainted with the language
spoken the misuse of them would be productive
of any thing but evident nonsense
 ambiguity in the first and second inten
tion of a word this has been applied to the

case where a word originally obscure or vague
has been precisely defined and is subsequently

used both in its original and in its newlyacquired
sense this species of negligent homonymity
though it may not often be the immediate source
of fallacy is frequently productive of much con
fusion and is therefore important

i do not

however consider the two significations of such
words as being very happily denominated first
and second intentions the precise scientific
sense of a word often comes nearer to that of the

root whence it is derived than the more vague

and popular sense and occasionally precedes it in
formation as for ex the word gas which was

coined by chemists for the designation of any
substance when in that particular state by the
vulgar it has subsequently been vaguely attached
to combustible gasses in general



 ambiguity from resemblance or analogy
this homonymity is scarcely distinguishable for

fall aci es



the present purpose from accidental homonymity

whenever the analogy is real the leg of a table
or the foot of a mountain can hardly be con
founded with the leg or foot of a man but when

the analogy is fictitious or fanciful as dr
whately has it the ambiguity is far more im
portant or rather the error of expression√¢Äîfor it is
under the latter head that i have considered this

source of fallacy as being more appropriately
classed this subject is scarcely mentioned by
dr whately i shall therefore refer the reader to

what i have said in a former chapter on fictitious
entities in general and to my head of fallacies
of fiction in the present chapter
iv ambiguity from ideas being connected
by vicinity of time and place i should rather
designate this source of fallacy by the denomina

tion homonymity of paronymous words amongst
the examples given in the elements on the present
occasion the homonymity of operations and their
results had been frequently remarked by mr
bentham as a great source of confusion in dis
course and thence of error the double mean

ing of the word shot can scarcely be referrible
to the present head but approaches very near
to accidental homonymity

gaining of a high price c√¢Äù there is a combi
nation of obscurity of expression and error in the
extent of collective entities

the latter source

of fallacy is that which may be observed in the
remaining examples and appears to be the one
which drwhately had more particularly in view
in applying to these cases the denomination of

fallacies of division and composition
 the fallacia accidentis and others men

tioned in √¢ß p appear to be among those
which are founded on obscurity in expression
so it is at any rate in the case of √¢Äúprotestant
ascendancy√¢Äù p as to the phrase √¢Äúwhat

is bought in the market is eaten c√¢Äù the fallacy
or rather the jest or quibble rests in the ambi

falla cies



guity of the word what which may mean either
whatever or some thing
we now come to the material or nonlogical
fallacies which lie in the sense either of the

premises or of the conclusion not in the con
nection between them such at least is the
definition which may be gathered from what is
said in p whether this denomination is
an appropriate designation of the group of falla
cies to which it is applied is a question which
may best be answered by a short examination of
the several species it contains
these species are arranged by the author

under the three following heads begging
the question ii undue assumption irrele
want conclusion

 begging the question or petitio principii
which l have referred under the same name to

the head of fictitious argument the argument
in a circle also a species of fictitious argument
is here reckoned as a petitio principii but i have
thought it more convenient to restrict the latter
denomination to that species of fictitious argu
ment in which the question to be proved is an
nounced in the premises though it be in dis

guise as in the example given by dr whately



c h xi

in p where the conclusion is a repetition in
other words of the proposition exhibited in the
premiss in an argument in a circle of which
an example is given in p of the elements
each separate reasoning process may be such as
to exhibit no other fallacy than that of defective
evidence but the whole chain of reasoning when

connected together shews that no one proposi
tion can be adduced in support of the others as
the validity of each one rests only upon that of
those others this sort of reasoning may be il
lustrated by the theory of the ancients who sup
posed the sky did not fall because it was sup
ported by pillars resting on the earth the earth
in the same manner did not fall because it was
suspended from the sky by chains in the state
of knowledge at that time there was no reason to
deny that either of these causes separately might
be followed by such their respective effects but
put the two arguments together and the question
is immediately suggested why do not both earth
and sky fall down together 




 undue assumption p that

of the minor premiss may in general be referred
to my defective evidence the undue assumption
or rather supposed assumption of a major pre



fall aci es

miss is what i have termed undue generali
zation

but the √¢Äúcontrivances by which men may
deceive themselves or others in assuming pre
mises unduly√¢Äù are most of them fallacies of a

different nature

dr whately√¢Äôs examples may

be distributed as follows



 in horne tookes induction elements
p relating to nouns and verbs the fallacy
is that which i have termed fallacy of etymology
applied in the present instance to an universal

proposition
 when men are shamed into admitting a
false fact by being assured that it would argue
weakness to doubt it p the fallacy is one
of irrelevant argument and contains a mixture

of vituperative personalities and of fallacies of
excitation

 when the truth of a fact is caused to be

admitted by the assertion that it is curious or

remarkable p the fallacy is one of excita

tion referrible to the head of artful diversion
 the fallacy of references p has above
been classed with the fallacies of testimony
 the fallacious parallelism p is that
which i have denominated fallacy of illustration 



cih

xi

 irrelevant conclusion or ignoratio elenchi

√¢ß p this genus is defined √¢Äúthe
coming to a conclusion which is not the one re
quired√¢Äù and contains a variety of fallacies which
i should distribute in the following manner
 √¢Äúif a sophist has to defend one who has
been guilty of some serious offence which he
wishes to extenuate though he is unable dis

tinctly to prove that it is not such yet if he can
succeed in making the audience laugh at some
casual matter he has gained practically the same
point√¢Äù p here there appears to be noir
relevant conclusion√¢Äînor indeed any conclusion
at all the fallacy is that which i have termed
artful diversion

 √¢Äúlet it be a case of peculation and that

many mitigating circumstances have been brought
forward which cannot be denied the sophistical

opponent will reply √¢Äúwell but after all the
man is a rogue and there is an end of it√¢Äô√¢Äù p
 this belongs to fallacious epithets which
i have classed under defective testimony

 the fallacy quoted p from thucy
dides where cleon proved the justice of a
measure when its expediency was the question
is a case of artful diversion

fallacies



 √¢Äúwhen in a discussion one party win
dicates on a ground of general expediency a
particular instance of resistance to government
in a case of intolerable oppression the oppo
nent may gravely maintain that we ought not
to do evil that good may come√¢Äù p in
this answer there is both obscurity in the terms
good and evil and defective application of the
general proposition contained in the answer to
the particular case in question

 argumentum ad hominem p is
referrible either to vituperative or to laudatory
personalities

 argumentum ad verecundiam p 
to fallacies of authority

 argumentum ad populum p to fal
lacies of excitation

 the shifting the burden of proof to the
adversary as in the case of the sportsman who

when accused of barbarity in sacrificing un
offending hares to his amusement answers

√¢Äúwhy do you feed on the flesh of animals√¢Äù
p note belongs to the head of artful di
version

 in the example relating to the efficacy of



ch xi

faith p the fallacy is in the expression and
belongs to the head of error in extent of a col
lective entity
 the note to p refers in the first
place to fallacies of excitation with regard to
the other observations contained in the same note
i may presently have occasion to return to them
 the example relating to the neglect of
the study of mathematics in one of our univer
 



 

sities p is one of artful diversion



 the fallacy of combating the two premi

ses alternately p is artful diversion by
the form of expression
 the fallacious substitutions of the partial
for the universal the possible for the probable


the probable for the necessary c p are
fallacies of insufficient argument



 fallacy of objections p this
answers in some measure to the rejection in
stead of amendment of the book of fallacies

it

is one of the fallacies most commonly exempli
fied in the arguments both of innovators and

antiinnovators

i have designated it by the

name of rejection from partial objections and

classed it as a species of irrelevant objections

fallacies



 fallacy of proving part of the question
√¢ß p this is again the fallacy of insuf
ficient argument

 suppressed conclusion √¢ß p is
another instance of artful diversion by means of
the form of expression



after a chapter so long as the one i am
now speaking of devoted to the exposure of
fallacies it would be rather unfortunate for the

author to terminate by affording an example of
fallacy in his own discourse any one it is true
is liable to fall into error it is much easier
to detect fallacies than to avoid them the reader

may perhaps have observed them in unlimited

number in the preceding pages in the same
manner in which i have pointed out occasional
ones in dr whately√¢Äôs elements and so far the
one which i now speak of may be excused what

i allude to is in section of this chapter on
fallacies of that work where the author speaks of
the √¢Äújust and ingenious remark that jests are
fallacies√¢Äù a fallacy has been stated by him to

be √¢Äúan unsound mode of argument which ap
pears to demand our conviction and to be deci
sive of the question in hand when in fairness it
is not√¢Äù after this definition i do not think it



ch

xi

too much to assume that to be fallacious an ar

gument must be so formed as to produce some
degree of deception otherwise it would be either
no fallacy or no argument at all real or apparent
a jest he now tells us is √¢Äúa fallacy so palpa

ble as not to be likely to deceive any one√¢Äù and
therefore no fallacy

here is if i mistake not

ambiguity obscurity or error that a jestis in
some points analogous to a fallacy that it bears
√¢Äúthat resemblance of argument which is calcu
lated to amuse by the contrast√¢Äù are points which
i do not deny but that a jest is a fallacy that it

produces deception can surely not be admitted
an imitation is not a species a picture of a man
is not a man

before i conclude i must say a few words
respecting a note to p in which dr
whately mentions the book of fallacies to which
i have so often referred

the few observations

he makes on the character of this work must

be admitted to be generally fair and moderate

but there is one fallacy of which he accuses
the author of falling into perpetually which
i cannot discover in any of mr bentham√¢Äôs

writings i mean that of petitio principii as
thus distinguished from the use of vituperative

fallacies



or laudatory appellatives it would have been
much easier to decide upon this question if dr
whately had supported his assertion by quoting
some of the particular instances in which this
fallacy had been exemplified
in order to facilitate the comparison between

dr whately√¢Äôs classification of fallacies and the
method which i propose substituting to his i
shall here conclude by subjoining them both in
the tabular form reprinting dr whately√¢Äôs table
