preface 



nphe fyftem given in this work extends beyond that 

 commonly received in feveral diredions a brief 

ftatement of what is now fubmitted for adoption into 

the theory of inference will be the matter of this preface 

in the form of the propofition the copula is made as 
abftrad as the terms or is confidered as obeying only 
thofe conditions which are neceflary to inference 

every name is treated in connexion with its contrary 
or contradi£iory name the diftincftion between thefe words 
not being made and others fupplied in confequence 
eight really feparable forms of predication are thus ob 
tained between any two names the eight of the common 
fyftem amounting only to tix when as throughout my 
work the two forms of a convertible propofition are 
confidered as identical 

the complex propofition is introduced confifting in 
the coexiftence of two fimple ones the theory of the 
fyllogifm of complex propofitions is made to precede 
that of the fimple or ordinary fyllogifm which laft is 
deduced from it i have only ufed the word complexy 
htcixt jimple was already appropriated fee page 



iv preface 

by the introduftion of contraries the number of valid 
fyuogiftic forms is increafed to thirtytwo connected to 
gether by many rules of relation but all fhewn to contain 
each with reference to its own difpofition of names and 
contraries only one form of inference 

the diftindion of figure is avoided from the beginning 
by introducing into every propofition an order of refer 
ence to its terms 

a fimple notation which includes the common one 
gives the means of reprefenting every fyllogifm by three 
letters each accented above or below by infpeftion of 
one of thefe fymbols it is feen immediately i what 
fyllogifm is reprefented whether it be valid or in 
valid how it is at once to be written down what 
axiom the inference contains or what is the ad of the 
mind when it makes that inference chapter xiv 

a fubordinate notation is ufed page ix in abbrevia 
tion of the propofition at length 

compound names are confidered both when the com 
pofition is conjunctive and when it is disjunctive diftincfl 
notation and rules of transformation are given and the 
compound fyllogifms are treated as reducible to ordinary 
ones by invention of compound names 

the theory of the numerical fyllogifm is invefligated 
in which upon the hypothefis of numerical quantity in 
both terms of every propofition a numerical inference 
is made 

but when the numerical relations of the feveral terms 
are fully known all that is unufual in the quantity of the 
predicate is fhown to be either fuperfluous or elfe as i 
have called it fpurious 



preface v 

the old doarine of modals is made to give place to 
the numerical theory of probability many will objed 
to this theory as extralogical but i cannot fee on what 
definition founded on real diftindlion the exclufion of it 
can be maintained when i am told that logic confiders 
the validity of the inference independently of the truth 
or falfehood of the matter or fupplies the conditions 
under which the hypothetical truth of the matter of the 
premifes gives hypothetical truth to the matter of the 
conclufion i fee a real definition which propounds for 
confideration the forms and laws of inferential thought 
but when it is further added that the only hypothetical 
truth fhall be abfolute truth certain knowledge i begin 
to fee arbitrary diftindion wanting the reality of that 
which preceded without pretending that logic can take 
cognizance of the probability of any given matter i 
cannot underftand why the ftudy of the eflfed which 
partial belief of the premifes produces with refped to the 
conclufion fhould be feparated from that of the confe 
quences of fuppofing the former to be abfolutely true 
not however to difpute upon names i mean that i 
fhould maintain againft thofe who would exclude the 
theory of probability from logic that call it by what 
name they like it fliould accompany logic as a fludy 

i have of courfe been obliged to exprefs in my own 
manner my own convictions on points of mental philo 
fophy but any one will fee that in all which i have 
propofed for adoption it matters nothing whether my 
views of the phenomena of thought or others be made 
the bafis of the explanation so far therefore as i am

elements of logic 



chapter i 

firji notions 

the firft notion which a reader can form of logic is by 
viewing it as the examination of that part of reafoning 
which depends upon the manner in which inferences are formed 
and the inveftigation of general maxims and rules for conftrudl 
ing arguments fb that the conclufton may contain no inaccuracy 
which was not previoufly aflerted in the premifes it has fo far 
nothing to do with the truth of the £ts opinions or prefump 
tions from which an inference is derived but imply takes care 
that the inference fhall certainly be true if the premifes be true 
thus when we fay that all men will die and that all men are 
rational beings and thence infer that fome rational beings will 
die the logical truth of this fentence is the fame whether it be 
true or falfe that men are mortal and rational this logical truth 
depends upon xhtjlriufure of the fentence zndjiotjapon the par 
ticular matters fpoken of thus 

inftead of write 

all men will die every y is x 

all men are rational beings every y is z 

therefore fome rational beings therefore fome zs are xs 
will die 

the fecond of thefe is the feme propofltion logically confidered 
as the firft the confequence in both is virtually contained in 
and rightly inferred from the premifes whether the premifes 
be true or falfe is not a queftion of logic but of morals philofb 
phy hiftory or any other knowledge to which their fubjes 

b 



 firji notions of logic 

matter belongs the queftion of logic is does the conclufion 
certainly follow if the premifes be true 

every aft of reafoning muft mainly confift in comparing to 
gether different things and either finding out or recalling from 
previous knowledge the points in which they refemble or differ 
from each other that particular part of reafoning which is 
called inference confifls in the comparifon of feveral and different 
things with one and the fame other thing and afcertaining the 
refemblances or differences of the feveral things by means of 
the points in which they refemble or differ from the thing with 
which all are compared 

there mufl then be fome propofitions already obtained before 
any inference can be drawn all propofitions are either affer 
tions or denials and are thus divided into affirmative and negative 
thus x is y and x is not y are the two forms to which 
all propofitions may be reduced thefe are for our prefent 
purpofe the mofl fimple forms though it will frequently hap 
pen that much circumlocution is needed to reduce propofitions 
to them thus fuppofe the following affertion if he fhould 
come tomorrow he will probably flay till monday how is 
this to be reduced to the form x is y there is evidently 
fomething fpoken of fomething faid of it and an affirmative 
connexion between them something if it happen that is the 
happening of fomething makes the happening of another fome 
thing probable or is one of the things which render the hap 
pening of the fecond thing probable 

x is y 



the happening of his 
arrival tomorrow 



an event from which it may be 
inferred as probable that he 
will ftay till monday 



the forms of language will allow the manner of afferting to 
be varied in a great number of ways but the reduction to the 
preceding form is always poffible thus fo he faid is an affir 
mation reducible as follows 



what you have jufl f the thing which 

faid or whatever is 
clfe fo refers to 



firji notions of logic 

by changing is into is not we make a negative propofi 
tion but care muft always be taken to afcertain whether a 
propofition which appears negative be really fo the principal 
danger is that of confounding a propofition which is negative 
with another which is affirmative of fomething requiring a nega 
tive to defcribe it thus he refembles the man who was not 
in the room is affirmative and muft not be confounded with 
 he does not refemble the man who was in the room again 
• if he fhould come tomorrow it is probable he will not ftay till 
monday does not mean the fimple denial of the preceding pro 
pofition but the affirmation of a direftly oppofite propofition 
it is 

 is y 

— fan event from which it maybe 

the happening of his j i inferred to be probable that 
amval tomorrow j jn fty u monday 

whereas the following 

 f u r event from which it may be 

 ° is inferred as probable that he 

arrival tomorrow j jy jj 

would be expreflid thus if he fhould come tomorrow that is 
no reafbn why he fhould ftay till monday 

moreover the negative words not no c have two kinds of 
meaning which muft be carefully diftinguifhed sometimes they 
deny and nothing more fometimes they are ufed to affirm the 
diredl contrary in cafes which offer but two alternatives one 
of which is neceflary thefe amount to the fame thing fince the 
denial of one and the affirmation of the other are obvioufly 
equivalent propofitions in many idioms of converfation the 
negative implies affirmation of the contrary in cafes which offer 
not only alternatives but degrees of alternatives thus to the 
queftion is he tall the fimple anfwer no moft frequently 
means that he is the contrary of tall or confiderably under the 
average but it muft be remembered that in all logical reafbn 
ing the negation is fimply negation and nothing more never 
implying affirmation of the contrary 

the common propofition that two negatives make an affirm 
ative is true only upon the fuppofition that there are but two 



 firji notions of logic 

pofble things one of which is denied grant that a man muft 
be either able or unable to do a particular thing and then not 
unable and able are the fame things but if we fuppofe various 
degrees of performance and therefore degrees of ability it is 
falfe in the common fenfe of the words that two negatives make 
an aiermative thus it would be erroneous to fey john is 
able to tranflate virgil and thomas is not unable therefore 
what john can do thomas can do for it is evident that the 
premifes mean that john is fo near to the beft fort of tranflation 
that an affirmation of his ability may be made while thomas is 
confiderably lower than john but not fo near to abfolute defi 
ciency that his ability may be altogether denied it will generally 
be found that two negatives imply an affirmative of a weaker 
degree than the pofitive affirmation 

each of the propofitions x is y and x is not y may 
be fubdivided into two fpectes the univerfal in which every 
poffible cafe is included and the particular in which it is not 
meant to be afterted that the affirmation or negation is univerial 
the four fpecies of propofition are then as follows each being 
marked with the letter by which writers on logic have always 
diftinguifhed it 

a univerfal affirmative every x is y 

e univerfal negative no x is y 

i particular affirmative some xs are ys 

o particular negative some xs are not ys 

in common converfation the affirmation of a part is meant to 
imply the denial of the remainder thus by fome of the apples 
are ripe it is always intended to figniiy that fome are not ripe 
this is not the cafe in logical language but every propofition is 
intended to make its amount of affirmation or denial and no 
more when we ay some x is y or more grammatically 
 some xs are ys we do not mean to imply that fome are not 
this may or may not be again the word fome means one or 
more poffibly all the following table will fhew the bearing 
of each propofition on the reft 

every xis jaffirms some xs are ts and denies a 

loome xs are not ts 



 



firji notions of logic 

no xis laffirms some xs are not ts and denies v v 

lsome xs are is 

some xs are ts does not contradift but denies no x is t 

some xs are not j 

some xs are not ts does not contradift y et denies every xis y 

contradihory propofitions are thofe in which one denies any 
thing that the other affirms contrary propofitions are thofe in 
whichone denies every thing which the other affirms or affirms 
every thing which the other denies the following pair are 
contraries 

every x is y and no x is y 

and the following are contradidlories 

every x is y to some xs are not ys 
no x is y to some xs are ys 

a contrary therefore is a complete and total contradictory 
and a little confideration will make it appear that the decifive 
diftin£tion between contraries and contradidtories lies in this 
that contraries may both be felfe but of contradisories one 
muft be true and the other falfe we may fay either p is true 
or fomething in contradiction of it is true but we cannot fay 
 either p is true or every thing in contradiction of it is true 
it is a very common miflake to imagine that the denial of a 
propofition gives a right to affirm the contrary whereas it fhould 
be that the affirmation of a propofition gives a right to deny the 
contrary thus if we deny that every x is y we do not affirm 
that no x is y but only that some xs are not ys while if we 
affirm that every x is y we deny no x is y and alfo some 
xs are not ys 

but as to contradictories affirmation of one is denial of the 
other and denial of one is affirmation of the other thus 
either every x is y or some xs are not ys affirmation of either 
is denial of the other and vice verfa 

let the ftudent now endeavour to fatisfy himfelf of the fol 
lowing taking the four preceding propofitions a e i o 
 let the fimple letter fignify the affirmation the fame letter in pa 
renthefes the denial and the abfence of the letter that there is 
neither affirmation nor denial

thefe may be thus fummed up the affirmation of a univerfal 
propofition and the denial of a particular one enable us to affirm 
or deny all the other three but the denial of a univerfal propo 
fition and the affirmation of a particular one leave us unable to 
affirm or deny two of the others 

in fuch propofitions as every x is y some xs are not ys 
c x is called the fubje£fj and y the predicate while the verb 

 is or is not is called the copula it is obvious that the 
words of the proportion point out whether the fubjeft is fpoken 
of univerfally or partially but not fo of the predicate which it is 
therefore important to examine logical writers generally give 
the name of dijiributed fubjefts or predicates to thofe which are 
fpoken of univerfally but as this word is rather technical i fhall 
fay that a fubjeft or predicate enters wholly or partially accord 
ing as it is univerfally or particularly fpoken of 

 in a or every x is y the fubjeft enters wholly but 
the predicate only partially for it obvioufly fays among the 
ys are all the xs every x is part of the couedlion of ys fo 
that all the xs make a part of the ys the whole it may be 
thus every horfe is an animal does not fpeak of all animals 
but ftates that all the horfes make up a portion of the animals 

 in e or no x is y both fubjes and predicate enter 
wholly no x whatfoever is any one out of all the ys 

 fearch the whole coueftion of ys and every y hall be found 
to be fomething which is not x 

 in i or some xs are ys both fubjedl and predicate enter 
partially some of the xs are found among the ys or make 
up a part the whole poffibly but not known from the preceding 
of the ys 

 in o or some xs are not ys the fubjedl enters partially 
and the predicate wholly some xs are none of them any 
whatfoever of the ys every y will be found to be no one out 
of a certain portion of the xs 

it appears then that 

in affirmatives the predicate enters partially 



firjl notions of logic 

in negatives the predicate enters wholly 

in contradidory propofitions both fubjedt and predicate enter 
differently in the two 

the converfe of a propofltion is that which is made by inter 
changing the fubjed and predicate as follows 





the propofltion 




its converfe 


a 


every x is y 




every y is x 


e 


no xisy 




no y is x 


i 


some xs are ys 




some ys are xs 


o 


some xs are not 


ys 


some ys are not xs 



now it is a fundamental and felfevident propofltion that no 
conlequence mufl be allowed to aifert more widely than its pre 
mifes b that for inflance an aifertion which is only of fome 
ys can never lead to a refult which is true of all ys but if a 
propofltion aflert agreement or difagreement anyother propofl 
tion which afterts the fame to the fame extents and no further 
mufl be a legitimate confequence or if ysu pleafe mufl 
amount to the whole or part of the original aflertion in another 
form thus the converfe of a is not true for in evry x 
is y the predicate enters partially while in every y is x 
the fubjeft enters wholly all the xs make up a part of the 
ys then a part of the ys are among the xs or fome ys are xs 
hence the only legitimate converfe of every x is y is some 
ys are xs but in no x is y both fubjefl and predicate enter 
wholly and no y is x is in faft the fame propofltion as 
 no x is y and some xs are ys is alfo the fame as its con 
verfe some ys are xs here both terms enter partially but 
 some xs are not ys admits of no converfe whatever it is per 
fehy confiflent with all aifertions upon y and x in which y is 
the fubjes thus neither of the four following lines is incon 
fiflent with itfelf 

some xs are not ys and every y is x 

some xs are not ys and no y is x 

some xs are not ys and some ys are xs 

some xs are not ys and some ys are not xs 

having thus difcuifed the principal points connedled with the 
fimple aifertion i pafs to the manner of making two aifertions 



 firjl notions of logic 

give a third every inftance of this is called fyllogtffn the two 
aflertions which form the bafis of the third are called premtfes 
and the third itfelf the conclujion 

if two things both agree with a third in any particular they 
agree with each other in the fame as if x be of the fame colour as 
y arid z of fhe fame colour as y then x is of the fame colour as 
z again if x differ from y in any particular in which z 
agrees with y then x and z differ in that particular if x be 
not of the ame colour as y and z be of the feme colour as y 
then x is not of the colour of z but if x and z both differ 
from y in any particular nothing can be inferred they may 
either differ in the feme way and to the feme extent or not 
thus if x and z be both of different colours from y it neither 
follows that they agree nor differ in their own colours 

the paragraph preceding contains the effential parts of all in 
ference which confifls in comparing two things with a third and 
finding from their agreement or difference with that third their 
agreement or difference with one another thus every x is 
y every z is y allows us to infer that x and z have all thofe 
qualities in common which are neceffary to y again from 
every x is y and no z is y we infer that x and z differ 
from one another in all particulars which are effential to y the 
preceding forms however though they reprefent common reafbn 
ing better than the ordinary fyllogifm to which we are now com 
ing do not conftitute the ultimate forms of inference simple iden 
tity or nonidentity is the ultimate flite to which every affertion 
may be reduced and we fhall therefore firft afk from what 
identities c can other identities c be produced again 
fince we name objefts in fpecies each fpecies confifling of a 
number of individuals and fince our affertion may include all or 
only part of a fpecies it is further neceffary to afk in every in 
ftance to what extent the conclufion drawn is true whether of 
all or only of part 

let us take the fimple affertion every living man refpires v 
or every living man is one of the things however varied they 
may be which refpire if we were to enclofe all living men in 
a large triangle and all refpiring objects in a large circle the pre 
ceding affertion if true would require that the whole of the tri 
angle fhould be contained in the circle and in the fame way we 



firji notions of logic 

may reduce any aflertion to the expreffion of a coincidence total 
or partial between two figures thus a point in a circle may 
reprefent an individual of one fpecies and a point in a triangle 
an individual of another fpecies and we may exprefs that the 
whole of one fpecies is afterted to be contained or not contained 
in the other by fuch forms as all the a is in the o none 
of the a is in the o 

any two aftertions about x and z each expreffing agreement 
or difagreement total or partial with or from y and leading to a 
concluflon with refpeft to x or z is called a fyuogifm of which 
y is called the middle term the plainefl fyuogifm is the follow 



ing— 

every x is y 

every y is z 

therefore every x is z 



all the a is in the o 

all the o is in the d 

therefore all the a is in the n 



in order to find all the pofble forms of fyuogifm we mufl 
make a table of all the elements of which they can confifl 
namely — 

xand y 
every x is y 
no x is y 
some xs are ys 
some xs are not ys o 
every y is x 
some ys are not xs o

some of the a is in the o

now taking any one of the fix relations between x and y 
and combining it with either of thofe between z and y we

 every x is y no z is y and every z is y no x is y

ii in what manner can a univerfal negative conclufion be

only when we are able to aftert that one figure is entirely within 
and the other entirely without the circle thus 



every x is y 
no z is y 
no x is z 



all the a is in the o a 

none of the n is in the o e

is the only way in which a univerfal negative conclufion can be

drawn namely that part or all of one figure is contained in the 
other only when we are able to aftert that the whole circle is 
part of one of the figures and that the whole or part of the cir 
cle is part of the other figure we have then two forms

the fecond of thefe contains all that is ftridly neceffary to the 
conclufion and the firft may be omitted that which follows 
when an aftertion can be made as to fome muft follow when the

iv how can a particular negative propofition be inferred 
namely that part or all of one figure is not contained in the 
other it would feem at firft fight whenever we are able to 
afiert that part or all of one figure is in the circle and that part 
or all of the other figure is not the weakeft fyuogifm from which 
fuch an inference can be drawn would then feem to be as follows 



some xs are ys 
some zs are not ys 
some zs are not xs 



some of the a is in the o x 
some of the d is not in the o 
 some of the a is not in the a 



but here it will appear on a little confideration that the con 
clufion is only thus far true that thofe xs which are ys cannot 
be thofe zs which are not ys but they may be other zs about 
which nothing is aflerted when we fay thztfome zs are not ys 
and fiirther confideration will make it evident that a conclufion 
of this form can only be arrived at when one of the figures is 
entirely within the circle and the whole or part of the other 
without or elfe when the whole of one of the figures is without 
the circle and the whole or part of the other within or laftly 
when the circle lies entirely within one of the figures and not 
entirely within the other that is the following are the diftinfb 
forms which allow of a particular negative conclufion in which 
it hould be remembered that a particular propofition in the pre 
mifes may always be changed into a univerlal one without affedl 
ing the conclufion for that which neceflfarily follows from 
 fome follows fiom all

it appears then that there are but fix diftin£ fyllogifms all 
others are made from them by ftrengthening one of the premifes 
or converting one or both of the premifes where fuch converfion 
is allowable j or elfe by firft making the converfion and then 
ftrengthening one of the premifes and the following arrange 
ment will fliow that two of them are univerial three of the others 
being derived from them by weakening one of the premifes in a

we may fee how it arifes that one of the partial fyllogifms is 
not immediately derived like the others from a univerl one 
in the preceding a £ £ may be confidered as derived from 
a a a by changing the term in which y enters univerfally into 
a univerial negative if this be done with the other term inftead 
we have 

no x is yfrom which univerial premifes we cannot deduce a 
£very y is z univerfal conclufion but only fome zs are not xs 

if we weaken one and the other of thefe premifes as they 
ftand we obtain 

some xs are not ys no x is y 

every y is z and some ys are zs 



no conclufion 



some zs are not xs 



firji notions of logic 

equivalent to the fourth of the preceding but if we convert the 
firft premife and proceed in the fame manner 

from no y is x we obtain some ys are not xs 
every y is z every y is z 

some zs are not xs some zs are not xs 

which is legitimate and is the me as the laft of the preceding 
lift with x and z interchanged 

before proceeding to fhow that all the ufual forms are con 
tained in the preceding let the reader remark the following rules 
which may be proved either by couefting them from the preceding 
cafes or by independent reafoning 

 the middle term muft enter uni verfally into one or the other 
premife if it were not fo then one premife might fpeak of one 
part of the middle term and the other of another fo that there 
would in fa£l be no middle term thus every x is y every 
z is y gives no conclufion it may be thus ftated 

all the xs make up a part of the ys 
all the zs make up a part of the ys 

and before we can know that there is any common term of 
comparifon at all we muft have fome means of fhowing that the 
two parts are to fome extent the fame or the preceding premifes 
by themfelves are inconclufive 

 no term muft enter the conclufion more generally than it 
is found in the premifes thus if x be fpoken of partially in the 
premifes it muft enter partially into the conclufion this is ob 
vious fince the conclufion muft afiert no more than the premifes 
imply 

 from premifes both negative no conclufion can be drawn 
for it is obvious that the mere afllertion of difegreement between 
each of two things and a third can be no reafon for inferring 
either agreement or difagreement between thefe two things it 
will not be difficult to reduce any cafe which falls under this rule 
to a breach of the firft rule thus no x is y no z is y gives 

every x is fomething which is not y 
every z is fomething which is not y 



 



 ift notions of logic 

in which the middle term is not fpoken of univerfally in either 
again no y is x fome ys are not zs may be converted into 

every x is a thing which is not y 
some things which are not zs are ys 

in which there is no middle term 

 from premifes both particular no conclufton can be drawn 
this is fuieciently obvious when the firft or fecond rule is broken 
as in some xs are ys some zs are ys but it is not immediately 
obvious when the middle term enters one of the premifes uni 
verfally the following reafoning will ferve for exercife in the 
preceding refults since both premifes are particular in form 
the middle term can only enter one of them univerfally by being 
the predicate of a negative propofition confequently rule 
the other premife muft be affirmative and being particular nei 
ther of its terms is univerfal confequently both the terms as to 
which the conclufion is to be drawn enter partially and the con 
clufion rule can only be a particular affirmative propofition 
but if one of the premifes be negative the conclufion mufl be 
negative as we fhall immediately fee this contradi£lion fhows 
that the fuppofition of particular premifes producing a legitimate 
refult is inadmiffible 

 if one premife be negative the conclufion if any muft be 
negative if one term agree with a fecond and difagree with a 
third no agreement can be inferred between the fecond and 
third 

 if one premife be particular the conclufion muft be p 
ticular this may be fhown as follows if two propofitions 
p and q together prove a third r it is plain that p and the 
denial of r prove the denial of q for p and qcannot be true 
together without r now if poffible let p a particular and q 
a univerfal prove r a univerfal then p particular and 
the denial of r particular prove the denial of qj but two 
particulars can prove nothing 

in the preceding fet of fyllogifms we obferve one form only 
which produces a or e or i but three which produce o 

let an aftertion be faid to be weakened when it is reduced 
from univerfal to particular and ftrengthened in the contrary cafe 
thus every x is z is called ftronger than some xs are zs 



firji notions of logic 

every ufual form of fyuogifm which can give a legitimate re 
fult is either one of the preceding fix or another formed from 
one of the fix either by changing one of the aflertions into its 
converfe if that be allowable or by ftrengthening one of the 
premifes without altering the conclufion or both thus 

some xs are ys f some ys are xs 

every y is z ay be wntten j every y is z 

what follows will ftill follow from rr 

 every y is z 

for all which is true when some ys are xs is not lefs true when 
 every y is x 

it would be poffible alb to form a legitimate yllogifm by 
weakening the conclufion when it is univerfal fince that which 
is true of all is true of fome thus every x is y every y 
is z which yields every x is z alfo yields some xs are zs 
but writers on logic have always confidered thefe fyllogifms as 
ufelefs conceiving it better to draw from any premifes their 
ftrongeft conclufion in this they were undoubtedly right and 
the only queftion is whether it would not have been advifable 
to make the premifes as weak as poffible and not to admit any 
fyllogifms in which more appeared than was abfolutely necefiary 
to the conclufion if fuch had been the pra£bice then 

every y is x every y is z therefore some xs are zs 

would have been confidered as formed by a fpurious and unne 
ceflary excels of aflertion the minimum of afiertion would be 
contained in either of the following 

every y is x some ys are zs therefore some xs are zs 
some ys are xsj every y is z therefore some xs are zs 

in this chapter fyllogifms have been divided into two clafies 
firft thofe which prove a univerlal conclufion fecondly thofe 
which prove a partial conclufion and which are all but one 
derived from the firft by weakening one of the premifes in fuch 
manner as to produce a legitimate but weakened conclufion 
thofe of the firft clafs are placed in the firft column and of the 
other in the fecond

every aitertion which can be made upon two things by com 
parifon with any third that is every fimple inference can be 
reduced to one of the preceding forms generally fpeaking one 
of the premifes is oinitted as obvious from the conclufion that 
is one premife being named and the conclufion that premife is 
implied which is neceffary to make the conclufion good thus 
if i fay that race muft have poflfefied fome of the arts of life 
for they came from afia it is obvioufly meant to be aflerted 
that all races coming from afia muft have pofltefted ibme of the 
arts of life the preceding is then a iyllogifm as follows 

that race is a race of afiatic origin 
every race of afiatic origin is a race which muft 
have pofiefied fome of the arts of life 
therefore that race is a race which muft have pofieited 

fome of the arts of life 

a perfon who makes the preceding aflertion either means to 
imply antecedently to the conclufion that all afiatic races muft 
have pofiefied arts or he talks nonfenfe if he aflert the conclur 



 tirji notions of logic 

fion pofitively x muft be z for it is y can only be an inference 
when every y is z this latter propofition may be called 
the fupprefled premife j and it is in fuch fuppreflfed propofitions 
that the greateft danger of error lies it is alfo in fuch propofi 
tions that men convey opinions which they would not willingly 
exprefs thus the honeft witnefs who faid i always thought 
him a repe£lable man— he kept his gig would probably not 
have admitted in direft terms every man who keeps a gig muft 
be refpeftable 

i fhall now give a few detached illuftrations of what precedes 

 his imbecility of charaser might have been inferred from 
his pronenefs to vourites for all weak princes have this fail 
ing the preceding would fland very well in a hiftory and 
many would pafs it over as containing very good inference 
written however in the form of a fyuogifm it is 

all weak princes are prone to fevourites 
he was prone to fevourites 

therefore he was a weak prince 

which is palpably wrong rule i the writer of fuch a fen 
tence as the preceding might have meant to fay for all who 
have this failing are weak princes in which cafe he would have 
inferred rightly every one fhould be aware that there is much 
falfe form of inference arifing out of badnefs of flyle which is 
juft as injurious to the habits of the untrained reader as if the 
errors were miftakes of logic in the mind of the writer 

 x is lefs than y y is lefs than z therefore x is lefs than 
z this at firft fight appears to be a fyuogifm but on re 
ducing it to the ufual form we find it to be 

x is a magnitude lefs than y 

y is a magnitude lefs than z 

therefore x is a magnitude lefs than z 

which is not a yllogifm fince there is no middle term evident 
as the preceding is the following additional propofition mufl be 
formed before it can be made explicitly logical if y be a mag 
nitude lefs than z then every magnitude lefs than y is alfo lefs 
than z there is then before the preceding can be reduced 
to a fyllogiftic form the neceffity of a dedudion from the fecond 



firjl notions of logic r 

premife and the fubftitution of the refult inftead of that premife 
thus 

x is lefe than y 
lefs than y is lefs than z following from y is lefe than z 

therefore x is lefs than z 

but if the additional argument be examined — namely if y be 
lefs than z then that which is lefs than y is lefs than z— it will 
be found to require precifely the fame conflderations repeated 
for the original inference was nothing more in £b it may 
eafilybe feen as follows that the propofition before us involves 
more than any fimple fyllogtfin can exprefs when we fay that 
x is lefs than y we fay that if x were applied to y every part 
of x would match a part of y and there would be parts of y 
remaining over but when we fay every x is y meaning 
the premife of a common fyllogifm we fay that every inftance of 
x is an inftance of y without faying any thing as to whether 
there are or are not inftances of y ftill left after thofe which 
are alfo x are takeii away if then we wifh to write an ordi 
nary iyllogifm in a manner which fhall correfpond with x is les 
than y y is lefs than z therefore x is lefs than z we muft 
introduce a more definite amount of afifertion than was made in 
the preceding forms thus 

every x is y and there are ys which are not xs 
every y is z and there are zs which are not ys 

therefore every x is z and there are zs which are not xs 
or thus 

the ys contain all the xs and more 
the zs contain all the ys and more 

the zs contain all the xs and more 
the moft technical form however is 

from every x is y some ys are not xs 

every y is z j some zs are not ys 

follows every x is z some zs are not xs 

this fort of argument is called a fortiori argument becaufo the 
premifes are more than fufficient to prove the conclufion and the 
extent of the conclufion is thereby greater than its mere form 
would indicate thus x is lefs than y y is lefs than z 



 firji notions of logic 

therefore a fortiori x is lefs than z means that the extent to 
which x is lefs than z muft be greater than that to which x is 
lefs than y or y than z in the fyllogifm laft written either 
of the bracketted premifes might be ftruck out without deftroying 
the conclufion which laft would however be weakened as 
it ftands then the part of the conclufion some zs are not 
xs follows a fortiori 

the argument a fortiori may then be defined as a univerfijly 
aiermative fyllogifm in which both of the premifes are fhewn to 
be lefe than the whole truth or greater thus in every x is 
y every y is z therefore every x is z we do not certainly 
imply that there are more ys than xs or more zs than ys fb 
that we do not know that there are more zs than xs but if 
we be at liberty to ftate the fyllogifm as follows 

all the xs make up part and part only of the ys 
every y is z j 

then we are certain that 

all the xs make up part and part only of the zs 

but if we be at liberty further to fay that 

all the xs make up part and part only of the ys 
all the ys make up part and part only of the zs 

then we conclude that 

all the xs make up part of part only of the zs 

and the words in italics mark that quality of the conclufion from 
which the argument is called a fortiori 

moft fyuogifms which give an affirmative conclufion are gene 
rally meant to imply a fortiori arguments except only in mathe 
matics it is feldom except in the exa£l fciences that we meet 
with a propofition every x is z which we cannot immediately 
couple with fome zs are not xs 

when an argument is completely eftablifhed with the excep 
tion of one afltertion only fb that the inference may be drawn as 
fbon as that one aftertion is eflablifhed the refult is ftated in a 
form which bears the name of an hypothetical fyllogifm the 
word hypothefis means nothing but fiippofition and the fpecies 
of fyllogifm juft mentioned firft lays down the aftertion that a 
confequence will be true if a certain condition be fulfilled and 



firji notions of logic 

then either afferts the fulfilment of the condition and thence the 
confequenceor elfe denies the confequence and thence denies 
the fulfilment of the condition thus if we know that 

when x is z it follows that p is q 

then as foon as we can afcertain that x is z we can conclude 
that p is q or if we can hew that p is not q we know that 
x is not z but if we find that x is not z we can infer no 
thing for the preceding does not aftert that p is qonly when 
x is z and if we find out that p is qwe can infer nothing 
this conditional yllogifm may be converted into an ordinary 
fyllogifm as follows let k be any cafe in which x is z and 
v a cafe in which p is q then the preceding aflfertion amounts 
to every k is v let l be a particular inftance the x of 
which may or may not be z if x be z in the inftance under 
difcuffion or if x be not z we have in the one cafe and the 
other 

every k is v every k is v 

l is a k l is not a k 

therefore l is a v no conclufion 

similarly according as a particular cafe m is or is not v we 
have 

every k is v every k is v 

m is a v m is not a v 



no conclufion m is not a k 

that is to fay the aftertion of an hypothefis is the aftertion of 
its neceftary confequence and the denial of the neceflfary confe 
quence is the denial of the hypothefis but the aftertion of the 
neceftary confequence gives no right to aftert the hypothefis nor 
does the denial of the hypothefis give any right to deny the truth 
of that which would were the hypothefis true be its neceftary 
confequence 

demonftration is of two kinds which arifes from this that 
every propofition has a contradiftory and of thefe two one 
muft be true and the other muft be falfe we may then either 
prove a propofition to be true or its contradictory to be falfe 
 it is true that every x is z and it is falfe that there are fome 
xs which are not zs are the fame propofition and the proof 
of either is called the indireft proof of the other 



 firji notions of logic 

but how is any propoiidon to be proved falfe except by prov 
ing a contradi£tion to be true by proving a neceftary conie 
quence of the proportion to be falfe but this is not a complete 
anfwer fince it involves the neceffity of doing the lame thing 
or fb far as this anfwer goes one propofition cannot be proved 
falfe unlefe by proving another to be falfe but it may happen 
that a neceftary confequence can be obtained which is obvioufly 
and felfevidently falfe in which cafe no further proof of the 
falfehood of the hypothefis is neceflary thus the proof which 
euclid gives that all equiangular triangles are equilateral is of the 
following flru£lure logically confidered 

i if there be an equiangular triangle not equilateral it fol 
lows that a whole can be found which is not greater than its 
part 

 it is falfe that there can be any whole which is not greater 
than its part felf evident 

 therefore it is felfe that there is any equiangular triangle 
which is not equilateral or all equiangular triangles are equila 
teral 

when a propofition is eflablifhed by proving the truth of the 
matters it contains the demonflradon is called diresf when by 
proving the falfehood of every contradi£tory propofition it is 
called indiresf the latter fpecies of demonflradon is as logical 
as the former but not of fo fimple a kind whence it is defira 
ble to ufe the former whenever it can be obtained 

the ufe of indiret demonflradon in the elements of euclid 
is almofl endrely confined to thofe propofidons in which the con 
verfes of fimple propofidons are proved it frequendy happens 
that an eflablifhed afterdon of the form 

everyxisz i 

may be eafily made the means of deducing 

every thing not x is not z • • 
which lafl gives 

everyzisx 

• this is the propofition in proof of which nearly the whole of the dc 
monftration of euclid is fpent 



firji notions of logic 

the converfion of the fecond propoiition into the third is 
uilially made byanindire£t demonftrationin the following manner 
if poffible let there be one z which is not x being true 
then there is one thing which is not x and is z but every 
thing not x is not z therefore there is one thing which is z 
and is not z which is abfurd it is then abfurd that there 
hould be one angle z which is not x or every z is x 

the following propofidon contains a method which is of fre 
quent ue 

hypothesis — let there be any number of propoiitions or 
aftertions — three for inftance x y and z — of which it is the 
property that one or the other muft be true and one only let 
there be three other propoiitions p q and r of which it is 
alfo the property that one and one only muft be true let it 
alfo be a connexion of thofe aftertions that 

when x is true p is true 
when y is true qis true 
when z is true r is true 

consequence then it follows that 

when p is true x is true 
when qis true y is true 
when r is true z is true 

for when p is true then qand r muft be felfe coniequently 
neither y nor z can be true for then q or r would be true 
but either x y or z muft be true therefore x muft be true 
or when p is true x is true in a fimilar way the remaining 
aftertions may be proved 

cafe i if when p is q x is z 

when p is not q x is not z 
it follows that when x is z p is qj 

when x is not z p is not q 

r when x is greater than z p is greater than q 

cafe if when x is equal to z p is equal to q 

i when x is lefs than z p is lefs than q 

r when p is greater than q x is greater than z 
it follows that when p is equal to q x is equal to z 

twhenpislefethan q x is lefs than z 



 



chapter ii 

on ohjeslsy ideas and names 

logic is derived from a greek word jiyo which fignifies 
communication of thought ufually by fpeech it is the 
name which is generally given to the branch of inquiry be it called 
fcience or art in which the aft of the mind in reafoning is con 
fldered particularly with reference to the connexion of thought 
and language but no definition yet given in few words has 
been found fatisfaftory to any confiderable number of thinking 
peribns 

all exifting things upon this earth which have knowledge of 
their own exiftence poltefs fome in one degree and fome in 
another the power of thought accompanied by perception which 
is the awakening of thought by the efieft of external objeds 
upon the fenfes by thought i here mean all mental a£lion not 
only that comparatively high ftate of it which is peculiar to man 
but alfo that lower degree of the fame thing which appears to be 
poltefted by brutes 

with refpe£t to the mind confidered as a complicated ap 
paratus which is to be ftudied we are not even fo well off as 
thofe would be who had to examine and decide upon the n 
chanifm of a watch merely by obfervation of the fiindlions of 
the hands without being allowed to fee the inflde a meoli 
cian to whom a watch was prefented for the firfl time would be 
able to give a good guefs as to its fru£lure from his knowledge of 
other pieces of contrivance as fbon as he had examined the law of 
the motion of the hands he might conceivably invent an inflru 
ment with fimilar properties in fifty different ways but in the 
cafe of the mind we have manifeflations only without the 
fmallefl power of reference to other fimilar things or the leafl 
knowledge of flru£ture or procefs other than what may be 
derived from thofe manifeflations it is the problem of the watch 
to thofe who have never feeii any mechanifhi at all 



on objesls ideas and names 

we have nothing more to do with the cience of mind 
ufually called metaphyjics than to draw a very few neceffary 
diftindlions which whatever names we ufe to denote them are 
matters of fa£l conne£led with our fubje£l some modes of 
expreffing them favor one fyftem of metaphyilcs and fbme 
another but ftill they are matters of obferved fa£l our words 
muft be very imperfe£t fymbols drawn from comparifbn of the 
manifeftations of thought with thofe of things in corporeal ex 
iftence for inftance i juft now fpoke of the mind as an 
apparatus or piece of mechanifm it is a ftrudlure of fome fort 
which has the means of fulfilling various purpofes and fo far it 
refembles the hand which by the diipofidon of bone and muicle 
can be made to perform an immenfe variety of different motions 
and grafps where the refemblance begins to be imperfe£t and 
why is what we cannot know in all probability we fhould 
need new modes of perception other fenfes befides fight hear 
ing and touch in order to know thought as we know colour 
iize or motion but the purpofe of the prefent treatife is only 
the examination of fome of the manifefladons of thinking power 
in their relation to the language in which they are expreflfed 
knowledge of thought and knowledge of the refults of thought 

 all iyftems make an aftumption of the uniformity of procefs in all 
minds carried to an extent the propriety of which ought to be a matter of 
fpecial difcuflion there are no writers who give us fo much mufi with fo 
little why as the metaphyficians if perfons who had only feen die outfide 
of the timepiece were to invent machines to anfwer its purpofe they might 
arrive at their objel in very different ways one might ue the pendulum 
and weight another the fprings and the balance one might difcover the 
combination of toothed wheels another a more complicated ation of lever 
upon lever are we fun that there are not differences in our minds fuch 
as the preceding inftance may fuggeft by analogy if fo hvw are we fure 
again if our minds be as tables with many legs do we know that a weight 
put upon different tables will be fupported in the fame manner in all may 
not the fame leg fupport much or all of a certain weight in one mind and 
little or nothing in another i have feen ftriking xnftances of fomething like 
this among thofe who have examined for themfelves the grounds of the 
mathematical fciences 

i would not difluade a hident from metaphyfical inquiry on the con 
trary i would rather endeavour to promote the defire of entering upon fuch 
fubjels but i would warn him when he tries to look down his own throat 
with a candle in his hand to take care that he does not fet his head on fire

are very different things the watch abovemendoned might 
have the fiin£tions of its hands difcovered might be uied in find 
ing longitude and even latitude all over the world without the 
parties ufing it having the fmalleft idea of its interior ftru£hire 

that our minds fouls or thinking powers uie what name 
we may exift is the thing of all others of which we are moft 
certain each for himielf next to this nothing can be more 
certain to us each for himfelf than that other things alio exift 
other minds our own bodies the whole world of matter but 
between the charader of theie two certainties there is a vaft dif 
ference any one who hould deny his own exiftence would 
if ferious be held beneath argument he does not know die 
nieaning of his words or he is falie or mad but if the fame 
man fhould deny that any thing exifts except himielf that is if 
he hould affirm the whole creation to be a dream of his own 
mind he would be abfolutely unanwerable if i who know he 
is wrong for am certain of my own exiftence argue with him 
and reduce him to fllence it is no more than might happen in 
his dream a celebrated metaphyfician berkeley maintained 
that with regard to matter the above is the ftate of the cafe 
that our impreffions of matter are only impreffions communi 
cated by the creator without any intervening capfe of communi 
cation 

our moft convincing communicable proof of the exiftence of 
other things is not the appearance of obje£ts but the neceffity 
of admitting that there are other minds befides our own the 
external inanimate obje£ts might be creations of our own 
thought or thinking and perceptive fimdiion they are fo fbme 
dmes as in the cafe of infanity in which the mind has frequendy 
the appearance of making the whole or part of its own external 
world but when we fee other beings performing fimilar fimc 
dons to thofe which we ourielves perform we come fo irrefiftibly 
to the conclufion that there muft be other fendents like ourfelves 
that we hould rather compare a perfon who doubted it to one who 
denied his own exiftence than to one who fimply denied the real 
external exiftence of the material world 

 it is not impoillble that in a real dream of fleep fome one may have 
created an antagonlft who beat him in an argument to prove that he was 
awake 



on objebs ideas and names 

when once we have admitted different and independent 
minds the reality of external obje£ls external to all thofe minds 
follows as of courfe for different minds receive impreffions at 
the fame time which their power of communication enables 
them to know are imilar o far as any impreffions one in each 
of two different minds can be known to be iimilar there muft 
be zfomewhat independent of thofe minds which thus zs upon 
them all at once and without any choice of their own this 

fomewhat is what we call an external obje£l and whether it 
arife in berkeleys mode or in any other matters nothing to us 
here 

we fhall then take it for granted that external objes ashially 
exift independently of the mind which perceives them and this 
brings us to an important diftin£tion which we muft carry with 
us throughout the whole of this work beiides the a£tual exter 
nal obje£l there is alio the mind which perceives it and what 
for want of better words or rather for want of knowing whether 
they be good words or not we muft call the image of that obje 
in the mind or the idea which it communicates the term ub 

jesf is applied by metaphyilcians to the perceiving mind and 
thus it is laid that a thing may be confidered fubjeivefy with re 
ference to whaf it is in the mind or objesfively with reference 
to what it is independently of any particular mind but logicians 
uie the word fiibjea in another fenfe in a propoildon fuch as 
 bread is wholefome the thing fpoken of bread is called the 
fubjedl of the proportion and in fal the yror a fubjesf is in com 
mon language fb frequently confounded with obje that it is al 
moft hopelefs to fpeak clearly to beginners about themfelves as 

fubjesfs i fhall therefore adopt the words ideal and objesfive 
idea and objesf as being under explanations as good as any 
others and better xhdnfubje and obje for a work on logic 

 the word idea as here ufed does not enter in that vague fenfe 
in which it is generally ufed as if it were an opinion that might be 
right or wrong it is that which the object gives to the mind 
or the ftate of the mind produced by the obje£t thus the idea 
of horfe is the borfe in the mind and we know no other horfe 
we admit that there is an external objesf a horfe which may 
give a horfe in the mind to twenty different perfons but no one 
of thefe twenty knows the obje£l each one only knows his idea 



 on objesis ideas and names 

there is an objeft becauie each of the twenty perfons receives 
an idea without communicating with the others fo that there is 
fomething external to give it them but when they talk about 
it under the name of a horfe they talk about their ideas they 
all refer to the obje£t as being the thing they are talking about 
until the moment they begin to differ and then they begin to fpeak 
not of external horfes but of impreffions on their minds at leaft 
this is the cafe with thofe who know what knowledge is the pofi 
tive and the unthinking part of them ftill talk of the horfe and 
the latter have a great advantage over the former with thofe 
who are like ibemfelves 

why then do we introduce the term objesf at all fince all our 
knowledge lies in ideas for the fame reafon as we introduce the 
term matter into natural philofophy when all we know is form 
flze colour weight c no one of which is matter nor even all 
together it is convenient to have a word for that external 
fburce from which fenjihu ideas are produced and it is juft as 
convenient to have a word for the external fource material or 
not from which any idea is produced again why do we peak 
of our power of confidering things either ideally or objeftively 
when as we can know nothing but ideas we can have no right 
to peak of any thing elfe the anfwer is that juft as in other 
things when we fpeak of an obje£t we fpeak i the idea of an 
obje£f we learn to fpeak of the external world becaufe there 
are others like ourielves who evidently draw ideas from the fame 
fources as ourielves hence we come to have the idea of thofe 
fources the idea of external objedbs as we call them but we do 
not know thofe fources we know only our ideas of them 

we can even ufe the terms ideal and objeftive in what may 
appear a metaphorical fenfe when we fpeak of ourfelves in the 
manner of this chapter we put ourfelves as it were in the pofi 
don of fpe£tators of our own minds we fpeak and think of our 

 one man afferts a fa on his own knowledge another afferts his full 
cowvibiou of the contrary fab both ufe the evidence of their fenfes but 
the fecond knows that fuu cmvtion is all that man can have the firft 
will cany it hollow in a court of juftice in which perfons are conftantly 
compelled to fwear not only that they have an impreilion but that the im 
preillon is correal that is to fay b the impreillon which mankind in general 
would have and muft have and ought to have 



on objebsy ideas and names 

own minds obje£tively and it muft be remembered that by the 
word ohjeft we do not mean material objeft only the mind 
of another any one of its thoughts or feelings any relation of 
minds to one another a treaty of peace a battle a difcuffion 
upon a controverted queftion the right of conveying a freehold 
— are all objefts independently of the perfons or things engaged 
in them they are things external to our minds of which we 
have ideas 

an obje£t communicates an idea but it does not follow that 
every idea is communicated by an object the mind can create 
ideas in various ways or at leaf can derive l combinations 
which are not found in external exiftence new colle£tions pf 
ideas we have a perfefuy diftin£l idea of a unicorn or a flying 
dragon when we lay there are no fuch things we fpeak ob 
je£lively only ideally they have as much exiftence as a horfe or 
a flieep to a herald more add to this that the mind can 
feparate ideas into parts in fuch manner that the parts alone are 
not ideas of any exifting feparate material objefts any more than 
the letters of a word are conftituent parts of the meaning of the 
whole hence we get what are called qualities and relations a 
ball may be hard and round or may have hardnefs and round 
nefs but we caqrnot fay that hardnefs and roundnefs are feparate 
external materwobjeis though they are obje£s the ideas of 
which neceftarily accompany our perception of certain objefls 
thefe ideas are called ahjirasi as being removed or abftra£ted from 
the complex idea which gives them the abftra£ion is made by 
comparifon or obfervation of refemblances if a perfon had never 
feen any thing round except an apple he would perhaps never 
think of roundnefs as a diftinft objeft of thought when he faw 
another round body which was evidently not an apple he would 
immediately by perception of the refemblance acquire a feparate 
idea of the thing in which they refemble one another 

abftra£tion is not performed upon the ideas of material objels 
only for inftance from condu£t of one kind running through 
a number of a£tions performed by a number of perfons we get 
the ideas of goodnefs wickedneis talent courage but we muft 
not imagine that we can make ideally external reprefentation of 
thefe words they are objesfs that is to fay the mind confiders 
them as external to itfelf but they are not iterial objects 



 on objedlsy ideas and names 

some people deny their exiftence and look upon them as only 
abftradl words or words under which we ipeak of minds or 
bodies without fpecifying any more than one of the ideas pro 
duced by thefe minds or bodies for inftance they affert that 
when we ay knowledge gives power it is really tiiat perfons 
with knowledge are therefore able or have power to produce 
or to do what perfons without it cannot this is a queftion 
which it does not concern me here to difcufs 

seeing that the mind pofleftes a power of originating new 
combinations of ideas and alio of abftradbing from complex ideas 
the more ample ones of which it feems natural to fay they are 
compofed it has long been a queftion among metaphyficians 
whether the mind has any ideas of its own which it pofteftes in 
dependently of all fuggeftion from external obje£ls it is not 
neceftary that i hould attempt to lead the ftudent to any con 
clufion on this fubje£l for our purpoie the diftin£lion between 
ideas and obje£ls though it were falfe is of more importance 
than that between innate and acquired ideas though it be true 
but one of thefe two things muft be true either we have ideas 
which we do not acquire from or by means of communication 
with the external world experience trial of our fenfes or there 
is a power in the mind of acquiring a certainty and a generality 
which experience alone could not properly give for inftance 
we are atisfied as of our own exiftence that feven and three col 
lected are the fame as five and five whatever the ohjehs may he 

 it has always appeared to me much fuch a queftion as the following 
there are hooks which certainly catch fiih if put into the water and moft 
certainly they have been put into the water there are then fiih upon them 
but thefe fiih might have been on fome of them when they were put into the 
water it is to no purpofe to inquire whether it was fo or not unleis there 
be fome diitinlion between the fiihes which may make it a queftion whether 
fome of them could have been bred in the river into which the hooks were 
put the iiind has certainly a power of acquiring and retaining ideas 
which power when put into communication widi the external world it muil 
exercife there is no mind to experiment upon except thofe which have 
had fuch communication are there found any ideas which we have reaibn 
to think cmdd not have been acquired by this communication any fifties 
which could not have come out of the river metaphyficians feem to admit 
that if any ideas be innate they are thofe of fpace time and of caufe and 
efte£l they feem alfo to admit that if there be any ideas which not being 
innate are fure to be acquired they are thefe very ones

in point of fiwsl between our mode of viewing and knowing

following remarks on the general fubjel are worth confideration it is 
indeed extremely difficult to find in fpeaking of this fubjel expreflions 
which are fatisfa£lory the reality of the objels which we perceive is a 
profound apparently an infoluble problem we cannot but fuppofe that 
exiftence is fomething different from our knowledge of exiftence — that what 
exifb does not exift merely in our knowing that it does — truth is truth 
whether we know it or not yet how can we conceive truth otherwife than 
as ibmething known how can we conceive things as exifting without 
conceiving them as objels of perception ideas and things are conftantly 
oppofed yet neceftarily coexiftent how they are thus oppofite and yet iden 
tical is the ultimate problem of all philofbphy the fuccefuve phafes of 
philofophy have confifted in feparating and again uniting thefe two oppofite 
elements in dwelling fometimes upon the one and fometimes upon the other 
as the principal or original or only element and then in difcovering that 
fuch an account of the fbite of the cafe was infufficient knowledge requires 
ideas reality requires things ideas and things coexifti truth and is 
known but the complete explanation of thefe points appears to be beyond 
our reach

different fpecies of affertions the truth of the laft named affer 
tion is not born with us for children are without it and learn it 
by experience as we know the mujt he fo cannot be acquired

how we derive that complete affurance that they will do ib as

to fay 

conneded with ideas are the names we give them the fpoken 
or written founds by which we think of them and communicate 
with others about them to have an idea and to make it the 
fubjeft of thought as an idea are two perfeftly diftin£l things 
the idea of an idea is not the idea itfelf i doubt whether we 
could have made thought itfelf the fubjeft of thought without 
language as it is we give names to our ideas meaning by a 
name not merely a fingle word but any coueftion of words which 
conveys to one mind the idea in another thus amanina 
blackcoatridingalongthe highroadonabayhorfe is as much 
the name of an idea as man black or horfe we can coin 
words at pleafure and were it worth while might invent a 
fingle word to ftand for the preceding phrafe

advantage and it will frequently be neceffary to fpecify whether 
we fpeak ideally or objeftively in common converfadon we 
fpeak ideally and think we fpeak objeftively we take for granted 
that our own ideas are fit to pafs to others and will convey to 
them the fame ideas as the obje£ts themfelves would have done

nothing to do here except to obferve that we are only incidentally 
concerned with this queftion in a work of logic we prefume 
fixed and if objeftive objelively true ideas with certain names 
attached fb that it is never in doubt whether a name be or be not 
properly attached to any idea this method muft be followed in 
all works of fcience a conceivably attamable end is firft pre 
fumed to be attained and the confequences of its attainment are 
ftudied then afterwards comes the queftion whether this end 
is alwars attained and if not why the way to mend bad roads 
muft come at the end not at the beginning of a treatife on the 
art of making good ones 

every name has a reference to every idea either affirmative or 
negative the term horfe applies to every thing either pofitively 
or negatively this no matter what i am fpeaking of either is 
or is not a horfe if there be any doubt about it either the idea 
is not precife or the term horfe is ill underftood a name ought 
to be like a boundary which clearly and undeniably either fliuts 
in or fhuts out every idea that can be fuggefted it is the im 
perfection of our minds our language and our knowledge of 
external things that this clear and undeniable inclufion or exclu 
fion is feldom attainable except as to ideas which are well within 
the boundary at and near the boundary itfelf all is vague there 
are decided greens and decided blues but between the two 
colours there are fliades of which it muft be unfettled by uni 
verial agreement to which of the two colours they belong to 
the eye green pailes into blue bymperceptible gradations our 
fenfes will fueft no place on wetch all agree at which one is 
to end and the other to begin 

but the advance of knowledge has a tendency to fupply means 
of precife definition thus in the inftance above cited wol 
lafton and fraunhofer have difcovered the black lines which al 
ways exift in the fpedhiim of fblar colours given by a glafs prifm 
in the fame relative places there are definite places in the fpec 
trumby the help of which the place of any fhade of colour therein 
exifting may be afeertained and means of definition given 

when a name is complex it frequently admits of definition 

• it is quite within the poflibilities of the application of fcience to the 



 on objebs ideas and names 

nominal or real a name may be faid to be defined nominally 
when we can of rigt fubftitute for it other terms in fuch a 
cafe a perfon may be made to know the meaning of the word 
without accefs to the objeft of which it is to give the idea thus 
an ijland is completely defined in land furrounded by water 
in definition we do not mean that we are neceftarily to have 
very precife terms in which to explain the name defined but as 
the terms of the definition b is the name which is defined ac 
cording as the firfl are precife or vague clear or obfcure o is the 
fecond thus there may b a queftion as to the meaning of 
land is a marfh flicking up out of the water an ifland some 
will fay that as oppofed to water a marfh is land others may 
confider marfh as intermediate between what is commonly called 
dry land and water if there be any vaguenefs the term ifland 
mufl partake of it for ifland is but fhort for land furrounded by 
water whether this phrafe be vague or precife this fort of de 
finition is nominaly being the fubflitution of names for names it 
is complete for it gives all that the name is to mean an ifland 
as fuch can have nothing neceftarily belonging to it except what 
neceftarily belongs to land furrounded by water by real de 
finition i mean fuch an explanation of the word be it the whole 
of the meaning or only part as will be fufficient to feparate the 
things contained under that word from all others thus the 
following i believe is a complete definition of an elephant an 
animal which naturally drinks by drawing the water into its nofe 
and then fpirting it into its mouth as it happens the animal 
which does this is the elephant only of all which are known upon 
the earth fo long as this is the cafe fo long the above definition 
anfwers every purpofe but it is hx from involving all the ideas 
which arife from the word neither fagacity nor utility nor the 
produftion of ivory are neceftarily conne£ted with drinking by 
help of the nofe and this definition is purely objeftive we do 
not mean that every idea we could form of an animal fo drinking 
is to be called an elephant if a new animal were to be difco 
vered having the fame mode of drinking it would be a matter 
of pure choice whether it fhould be called elephant or not it 

arts that the time ihould come when the fpbum and the lines in it will 
be ufed for matching colours in every linoidrapers hop

muft then be fettled whether it hall be called an elephant and 
that race of animals hall be divided into two fpecies with diftinc 
tive definitions or whether it hall have another name and the 
definition above given hall be incomplete as not ferving to draw 
an entire difin£tion between the elephant and all other things 

it will be obferved that the nominal definition includes the real 
as fbon as the terms of flibflitution are really defined while the 
real definition may fall fhort of the nominal 

when a name is clearly underflood by which we mean when 
of every obje£l of thought we can diflinftly fay this name does 
or does not contain that objeftr— we have faid that the name ap 
plies to everything in one way or the other the word man 
has an application both to alexander and bucephalus the firf 
was l man the fecond was not in the formation of language 
a great many names are as to their original fignification of a 
purely negative chara£ler thus parallels are only lines which do 
not meet aliens are men wha are not britons that is in our 
country if language were as perfe£b and as copious as we 
could imagine it to be we fhould have for every name which has 
a pofidve fignification another which merely implies all other 
things thus as we have a name for a tree we fhould have an 
other to fignify every thing that is not a tree as it is we have 
fbmetimes a name for the pofitive and none for the negative as 
in tree fbmetimes for the negative and none for the pofitive as 
in parallel fometimes for both as in a frequent ufe of peron 
and thing in logic it is defirable to confider names of inclufion 
with the correfponding names of exclufion and this i intend to 
do to a much greater extent than is ufual inventing names of 
exclufion by the prefix not as in tree and nottree man and not 
man let thefe be called contrary j or £ontradtsfory names 

let us take a pair of contrary names as man and notman 
it is plain that between them they reprefent everything imaginable 
or real in the univerfe but the contraries of common langue 
ufually embrace not the whole univerfe but fbme one gene 
ral idea thus of men briton and alien are contraries every 
man mufl be one of the two no man can be both notbriton 
and alien are identical namesand fa are notalien and briton 

 i intend to draw no diilinfiion between thefe words 



 on objebs ideas and names 

the fame may be faid of integer and fraftion among numbers 
peer and commoner among fubjefts of the realm male and fe 
male among animals and fo on in order to exprefs this let us 
fay that the whole idea under confideration is the univeffe mean 
ing merely the whole of which we are confidering parts and let 
names which have nothing in common but which between them 
contain the whole idea under confideration be called contraries 
 or with refpesf to that univerfe thus the univerfe being 
mankind briton and alien are contraries as are foldier and civi 
lian male and female c the univerfe being animal man and 
brute are contraries c 

names may be reprefented by the letters of the alphabet thus 
a b c may ftand for any names we are confidering fimple or 
complex the contraries may be reprefented by nota notb 
c but i fhall ufually prefer to denote them by the fmall letters 
a a c thus everything in the univerfe whatever that uni 
verfe may embrace is either a or nota either a or either 
b or b c nothing can be both b and b every notb is i 
and every not is b and fo on 

no language as may well be fuppofed has been confruled 
beforehand with any intention of providing for the wants of any 
metaphyfical fyflem in mofl it is feen that the neceffity of 
providing for the formation of contrary terms has been obeyed 
our own language has borrowed from the latin as well as from 
its parent thus we have imperfesf dif agreeable as well as un 
formed and witlefs there is a choice of contraries without very 
well fettled modes of appropriation flanding for different de 
grees of contrariety thus we have not perfesf which is not fb 
ftrong a term as imperfesi and not imperfe£fy the contrary of a 
contrary which is not fb flrong as perfesf the wants of com 
mon converfation have fbmetimes retained a term and allowed 
the contrary to fink into difufe fbmetimes retained the contrary 
and neglefted the original term fbmetimes have even introduced 
the contrary without introducing any term for the original no 
tion and allowed no means of expreffing the original notion 
except as the contrary of a contrary if we could imagine a 
perfeft language we fhould fuppofe it would contain a mode of 
fignifying the contrary of every name this indeed our own lan 
guage may be aid to have though fometimes in an awkward and 



on objebs ideas and names 

unidiomadc manner one inflexion or one additional word 
may ferve to fignify a contrary of any kind thus not man is 
effeftive to denote all that is other than man but there is a 
wider want which can only be partially fupplied for its complete 
fatisfaslion would require words almoft beyond the power of 
arithmetic to count and all that has been done to make it le 
confifts in our language and in every other moftly in the forma 
tion of compound terms be they fiibftantive and adje£iive dou 
ble fubftantives or any others a clails of objeds has a fubclafs 
contained within it the individuals of which are diftinguifhed 
from all others of the clafs by fomething common to them and 
them only if the diftinguifhing charaderiftic have been fepa 
rated and a word formed to fignify the abftra£i idea that word 
or an adjeftive formed from it if it be not an adje£uve is joined 
with the general name of the clails thus we have ftrong men 
white horles c or it may happen that the individuals of the 
fubclafs take in right of the diftinguifhing chara£ieriftic a per 
feftly new name and by the moft varied rules a corngrinding 
man is called from the implement he ufes a miller a meat 
killing man from the organ which he fupplies a butchery if the 
firft idea of the etymology of this word be correfl other men 
ufe mills and other trades feed the mouth ftill cuftom has fet 
tled thefe terms though the firft ionly conne£led with its origin 
by the fpelling and the fecond by a derivation which muft be 
fought in anodier language but again it will more often hap 
pen that a diftin£iive chara£leriftic belonging to fome only gives 
no diftin£tive name to thokfomcj which ftill remain an unnamed 
fome out of the whole to be feparated by the defcription of their 
chara£ieriftic when wanted inftead of being the all of a name 
invented to exprefs them and them alone of their clafs in fuch 
a predicament for inftance are men who have never feen the 
fea as diftinguifhed from thofe who have feen it hence it ap 
pears that particular propofitions are not fo diftin£ from uni 
verial ones in real chara£ier as they are generally made to be 
if i fay fome as are bs the reader may well fuppofe that it is 
not often neceftary to advert to this fa£t had it been fo a name

 on objesis ideas ifnd names 

the fame convenience which di£ates the formation of a name 
for one fubclafs and not for another rules in the formation of 
contrary terms as already noted and thefe caprices of language 
— for logically confidered they are nothing elfe though their for 
mation is far from lawlefs — make it defirable to include in a for 
mal treatife the mofl complete confideration of all propofitions 
with reference not only to their terms but alfb to the contraries 
of thofe terms every negative propofition is afermative and 
every affirmative is negative whatever completely does one of 
the two include or exclude alfo does the other if i fay that 
 no a is b then b being the name of every thing not b in the 
univerfe of the propofition i fay that every a is i and if i 
lay that every a is b i fay that no a is b whether a lan 
guage will happen to poflefs the name b or i or both depends 
on circumflances of which logical preference is never one ex 
cept in treatifes of fcience the englifh may pofteis a term for 
b the french only for b fo that the fame idea muft be prefented 
in an affirmative form to an englifhman as in every a is b 
and in a negative one to a frenchman as no a is i from 
all this it follows that it is an accident of langue whether a pro 
pofition is univerfal or particular pofitive or negative we 
having the names a and b may be able to fay every a is b 
another language which only games the contrary of b mufl fay 
 no a is b a third language in which as have not a feparate 
name but are only individuals of the clafs c muft fay fbme cs 
are bs while a fourth which is in the further predicament of 
naming only i muft have it fbme cs are not is when we 
come to confider the fyuogifm we hall have full confirmation of 
the correnefs and completenefe of this view 

it may be objected that the intrdu£iion of terms which are 
merely negations of the pofitive ideas contained in other terms 
is a fpecies of fi£lion i anfwer that firft the fi£lion if it be a 
fidion exifts in language and produces its effe£ls nor will it 
eafily be proved more fi£litious than the invention of founds to 
ftand for things but fecondly there is a much more effe£tive 
anfwer which will require a little development 

when writers on loc up to the prefent time ufe fuch con 
traries as man and notman they mean by the alternative man 
and cvhything elfe there can be little effeftive meaning and

no ufe in a claflificatlon which becaufe they are not men in 
cludes in one word nouman a planet and a pin a rock and a 
featherbed bodies and ideas wifhes and things wifhed for but 
if we remember that in many perhaps moft propofitions the 
range of thought is much lefs extenfive than the whole univerfe 
commonly fo called we begin to find that the whole extent of a 
fubjeft of difcuffion is for the purpofe of difcuion what i have 
called a univerfe that is to fay a range of ideas which is either 
exprefted or underftood as containing the whole matter under 
confideration in fuch univerfes contraries are very common 
that is terms each of which excludes every cafe of the other 
while both together contain the whole and it muft be ob 
ferved that the contraries of a limited univerfe though it be a 
fufficient real definition of either that it is not the other are fre 
quently both of them the objefts from which pofitive ideas are 
obtained thus in the univerfe of property perfonal and real 
are contraries and a definition of either is a definition of the 
other but though each be a negative term as compared with 
the other no one will fay that the idea conveyed by either is that 
of a mere negation money is not laiid but it is fbmething and 
even when the contrary term is originally invented merely as a 
negation it may and does acquire pofitive properties thus 
alien is ftrifuy notbriton but fuppofe a man taken in arms 
againft the crown on fome fpot within its dominions and claim 
ing to be a prifoner of war the anfwer that he h a britifh fub 
jesl is a negation to eftablifh his pofitive claim he firft muft 
prove himfelf an alien and moreover that he is in another pofitive 
predicament namely that he is the fiibje£ of a power at war 
with great britain accordingly of two contraries neither 
muft be confidered as only the negation of the other except when 
the univerfe in queftion is fb wide and the pofitive term lb li 
mited that the things contained under the contrary name have 
nothing but the negative quality in common 

perception of agreements and difagreements is the foundation 
of all ajfertion the acquirement of fuch perception with refped 
to any two ideas by the comparifon of both with a third is the

ifted in the ideal conception of man achilles is a man as

ifted objeftively or no of all the ideas of man which the mind 
can imagine the former is one as well as the latter 

the feparation of ideas or formation of abftra£i ideas and 
aftertion by means of them prefents nothing for our purpofe 
which differs from the former cafe if we fay this pifture is 
beautiful the mere phrafe is incomplete for beautiful is only an 
attribute a purely ideal reference to a claffication which the 
mind makes di£lated by its own judgment the pi£lure being 
a material obje£i cannot be anything but an obje£l cannot be 
long to any clafs of notions unlefs that clafs contain objesls 
what the propofition may mean is to a certain extent dependent 
upon te implied fubftandve to which beautiful belongs that is 
to the clafs of objesls which the propofition implies the mind to 
have feparated into beautiful and not beautiful it may be that 
the picture is a beautiful pi£ture or a beautiful work of art tak

of what a and b mean with fuch ideas upon propofitions as 
are prefented by their yrj and are common to all forms of the

of thefe words the argument when the fiin fhines it is day 
but it is not day therefore the fun does not fhine contains a 
theory and two fasls the latter of which is made to follow from 
the former by the theory that inference is made is feen in the 
word therefore and the fentence is capable of being put upon its 
trial for truth or falfehood by logical examination but this exa 
mination rejedls the meaning of fun and day the truth of the 
theory and of the fadb and only inquires into the right which 
the fentence of its own ftrufture gives us to introduce the word 
therefore it merely enters upon when a v b is but b is 
not therefore a is not and decides that this is a correfl junc 
tion of precedents and confequent an exhibition of neceflaiy con 
nexion between what goes before and after therefore and a de 
velopment in the latter of what is virtually though not aftually 
expreffed in the former what a and b may mean is of no 
confequence to the inference or right to bring in a is not

names as names independently of thingis or at leaft may be fo 
confidered for the truth of the propofition under all mean

it is not therefore the objeft of logic to determine whether 
conclufions be true or falfe but whether what are aflerted to 
be conclufions are conclufions by a conclujion is meant that which 
is and muft be jhut in with certain other preceding things put in

inference does not give us more than there was before but it 
may make us fee more than we faw before ideally peaking 
then it does give us in the mind more than there was before 
but the homely truth that no more can come out than was in

—who are generally well pleaied to find the key of a box which 
contains what they want though fure that it will put in no more

from premifes is always prefent with them truths are concomi 
tants not confequences when we fay that one aflertion follows 
from another we fpeak purely ideally and defcribe an imperfec 
tion of our own minds it is not that the confequence follows 
from the premifes but that our perception of the confequence fol 
lows our perception of the premifes the confequence obje£uvely 
peaking is in and with and of the premifes we fpeak wrongly 
if we fpeak ideally when we ay that a is c is in a is b and

cultivated minds this fimple conclufion is never concomitant

from the certainty that a confequence may be made to come 
out which is an allegorical ufe of the word out we arume a right 
to declare by the fame fort of allegor that it was in the 
premifes therefore contain the conclufion and hence fome have 
poken as if in ftudying how to draw the conclufion we were 
ftudying to know what we knew before all the propofitions

neceflarily deducible from a very few fimple notions but to be

them 

another form of the aflertion is that confequences are virtually 
contained in the premifes or i fuppofe as good as contained in 
the premifes perfons not fpoiled by fophiftry will fmile when

there mufl always be fome contention as to the relative value 
of their knowledge between the ftudents of the things which we

we can fee might have been otherwife how much of the dlf 
tin£uon is due to our ignorance no one can tell in the mean

of fludying both kinds of knowledge than to attempt to inflitute 
a rivalry between them thofe who have undervalued the ftudy 
of neceftary confequences have allowed themfelves in illuflrat

perhaps than they intended 

 we might fometimes take them to mean that the hidy of neceftary

mal and how we arrive at our meaning is matter for volumes 
on different ftdes of unfettled queftions 

in order properly to examine the laws of inference or of any 
thing elfe we muft firft endeavour to arrive at a diftind abftrac 
tion of fo much of the idea we are concerned with as is itfelf the 
precedent reafon if it be right fo to fpeak of the law in queftion 
this is an eafy procefs upon familiar things we do not give 
the carriers of goods much credit for profundity in feeing that 
on a given road there is only the difference of weight by which 
they are concerned to know how one parcel differs from another 
and further that as long as they have to carry a pound it matters 
nothing whether it be of fugar or iron it is this procefs which 
we want to perform to the utmoft upon the fimple propofition 
writers on logic from ariftotle downwards have made a large 
and important ftep in fubftituting for fpecific names with all their 
fuggeftions about them the mere letters of the alphabet a b 
c c thefe letters zrejmbolsj and general fymbols each of 
them ftands for any one we pleafe of its clafs but what are 
they fymbols of names ideas or the objefts which give thofe 
ideas the anlwer is that this is precifely one of thofe confi 
derations which we may leave behind in abftrafting what is 
necefltary to an examination of the laws of inference the only 
condition is that we are to confine ourfelves to one or the other 
when we fay man is animal it may be that the name man is 
contained in the name animal that the idea of man is contained 
in that of animal or that the objesl man is in the obje£i animal 
or if there were twenty more different appropriations of the 

 meaning of courfe page ideas of ideas and ideas of objefts 



 on the abjirab form 

fymbols the fame thing might be aid of each this is i believe 
the firft ufe of the general fymbol in order of time the algebrai 
cal ufe of letter or other fymbol to defignate number being both 
fubfequent and derived 

when therefore we fay every x is y we underftand that 
x is a fymbol which reprefents an inftance of a name idea ob 
jeft c as the cafe may be there may be more or fewer of 
fuch inftances they may be nunierable or innumerable and the 
fame of y the language of logicians has generally been unfa 
vourable to the diftinft perception of their terms being diftribu 
tively applicable to clafles of inftances they have rather been 
quantitative than quantuplicitative exprefling themfelves as if in 
faying that animal is a larger or wider term than man they would 
rather draw their language from the idea of two areas one of 
which is larger than the other than from two colle£lions of indi 
viftble units one of which is in number more than the other 
they have even carried this ib far as to make it doubtful except 
from context whether their diftinftion between univerial and par 
ticular is that of all lndfomej or of the wholeand part if their 
inftances had been white fquares their all ais b and fome a 
is b might have applied as well to all the fquare is white and 
 some of the fquare is white as to all the fquares are white and 
 some of the fquares are white i hall take particular care 
to ufe numerical language as diftinguifhed from magnitudinal 
throughout this work introducing of courfe the plurals xs ys 
zs c 

i may mention here another mode of fpeaking which will i 
think appear obje£lionable to all who are much ufed to confi 
deration of quantity when a compound idea contains two or 
more fimpler ones fbme logicians have fpoken as if the com 
bination were legitimately reprefented by arithmetical addition 
thus the combination of the ideas pf animal znd rational mn 
give the idea of man for the two notions coexift in nothing 
elfe that we know of accordingly fome write animal ratio 
nal man if this be intended as an abftra£iion of the notation of 
arithmetic for the purpofe of fitting to it entirely different mean 
ing there is of courfe no obje£ion which i need confider here 
but it feems to me that more is meant and that thofe who have 
ufed this notation imagine a great refemblance between combining 



n pf proportion 

ideas and cumulating them what the difference is i cannot 
pretend to fay any more than i can pretend to fay what the dif 
ference is between chemically combining volumes of oxygen and 
hydrogen fo as to produce water and fimple cumulation of them 
in the fame veffel fo as to produce a mixed gas every beginner 
knows that the eleftricfpark or fome other inexplicable agency 
is neceffary to turn the mixed gas into a new chemical combina 
tion but that the difference exifts in the former cafe alfo feems 
to me as clear as any thing i can imagine even in chemiftry the 
cumulative notation which was once thought an allfufficient mode 
of expreffing the refults of the atomic theory has failed with the 
progrefs of knowledge to a confiderable extent the introduc 
tion of modes of cumulation as yet anfwers the purpofe but 
there ftill remain ifomeric compounds differing in properties but 
of the fame compofition for example the tartaric and racemic 
acids of which profeffor graham fays elements afchemijiry p 
 a nearer approach to identity could fcarcely be con 
ceived than is exhibited by thefe bodies which are indeed the 
fame both in form and compofition but by no treat 
ment can the one acid be tranfmuted into the other if the 
above mode of confounding cumulation and combination be ad 
mifsble i fuppofe we might eafily give ourfelves a right to fay that 

 addition 

an equation at which the mathematician would flare 

so much for the charafteriflics of the terms of a propofition 
as wanted for the abflraft forms of inference it remains to 
confider thofe of the connefting copulae is and is not 

the complete attempt to deal with the term is would go to 
the form and matter of every thing in exijience at leafl if not to 
the poffible form and matter of all that does not exifl but might 
as for as it could be done it would give the grand cyclopaedia 
and its yearly fupplement would be the hiflory of the human ace 
for the time that logic exifls as a treated fcience arifes from 
the charafteriflics of the word requifite to be abflrafted in fludy 
ing inference being few and eafily apprehended it may be ufed 
in many fenfes all having a common property names ideas 
and objefts require it in three different fenfes speak of names 
and fay man is animal the is is here ap is of applicability to

 on the abftrasl form 

whatfoever idea obje£l c man is a name to be applied to 
that fame idea obje£l c animal is a name to be applied as 
to ideas the is is an is of pofteflion of all eflential cfaara£leriftics 
man is an idea which poiteites contains prefents all that is con 
ftitutive of the idea animau as to abfolute external objefts the 
is is an is of identity the moft common and pofitive ufe of the 
word every man is one of the animals touch him you touch 
an animal deftroy him you deftroy an animal 

thefe fenfes are not all interchangeable take the is of iden 
tity and the name man is not as a name the name animal the 
idea man is not as an idea the idea animal now we muft afk 
what common property is poflefled by each of thefe three notions 
of j on which the common laws of inference depend common 
laws of inference there certainly are if the applicability of the 
name a be always accompanied by that of b and that of b by 
that of c then that of a is always accompanied by that th c if 
the idea a contain all that is eflential to the idea b and b all that 
is eflential to c then a contains all that is effential to c if the 
objefl a be aftually the objedl b and if b be adlually c then 
a is adlually c 

the following are the charadleriftics of the wrd is which ex 
ifting in any propofed meaning of it make that meaning fatisfy 
the requirements of logicians when they lay down the propofition 
 a is b to make the ftatement diftinft let the propofition 
be doubly fingular or refer to one inftance of each one a and 
one b let it be this one a is this one b 

firft the double fingular propofition above mentioned and 
every fuch doublefingular mufl be indifferent to converflon the 
 a is b and the b is a mufl have the fame meaning and be 
both true or both felfe 

secondly the connexion v exifling between one term and 
each of two others mufl therefore exifl between thofe two 
others fo a is b and a is c mufl give b is c 

thirdly the effential diflindlion of the term is not is merely 
that is and is not are contradictory alternatives one mufl both 
cannot be true 

every connexion which can be invented and fignified by the 
terms is and is not fo as to fatisfy thefe three conditions makes 
all the rules of logic true no doubt abfolute identity was the fug 



of the propqfition 

gefung connexion from which all the others arofe juft as arith 
metic was the medium in which the forms and laws of algebra 
were fuefted but as now we invent algebras by abftradl 
ing the forms and laws of operation and fitting new meanings to 
them fo we have power to invent new meanings for all the 
forms of inference in every way in which we have power to 
make meanings of is and is not which fatisfy the above condi 
tions for inftance let x y z each be the fymbol attached 
to every inftance of a clafe of material objeds let is placed be 
tween two as in x is y mean that the two are tied together 
by by a cord and let x be confidered as tied to z when it is 
tied to y which is tied to z c there is no fyllogifm but 
what remains true under thefe meanings thus 

the fyllogifm is true in the fenfe 

every x is y every x is tied to a y 

some zs are not ys some zs are not tied to ys 

 some zs are not xs some zs are not tied to xs 

this laft inftance might be confidered as a material reprefen 
tation of attachment together of ideas in the mind 

we muft diftinftly obferve that it is not every cafe of infe 
rence which demands all the charafteriftics to be fetisfied thus 
in the moft common cafe of all every a is b every b is c 
therefore every a is c of all the three conditions only the fe 
cond is wanted to fecure the validity of this cafe though it be fel 
dom thought worth while to make this obfervation yet it is uni 
ver£d practice to z upon it and ib as to introduce into formal 
logic apparent contradi£tions of its own rules for exampleth e 
following are allowed to pafs for fyuogifms in the ordinary defi 
nition of that word 

 every a is greater than fbme one b j every b is greater than 
fome one c therefore every a is greater than fome one c 
and the fame when inftead of greater than is read equal to or 
lefs than the form which moft commonly appears is the 
pair of doubly fingular propofitions a one thing is greater 
than b j b is greater than c therefore a is greater than c 
here greater than greater is greater the fecond rule is fatisfied 
and no other is wanted but this meaning for is or this fubfti 
tute for it if the reader like it better will not fatisfy all the con 



 on the abftrasl form 

ditions and therefore will not apply to all the forms of inference 

but is in the fenfe is equal to does fatisfy all the conditions 
this fenfe of ij namely agreement in magnitude is the copula of 
the mathematicians fyuogifm when he is reafoning on quantity 
only 

it will probably be affirmed that the generalization thus made 
or fhown to be poffible in the conception of the word is for 
purpofes of inference amounts only to a very frequent if not 
moft ufual ufe of the word namely as fignifying a certain mode 
not of identity but of agreement in quality as when we fay 
 thefe two things are the fame — in colour or the one thing is 
the other — in colour that the name man is the name animal 
in a certain repe£l namely in what the latter can be applied to 
that the idea man is animal in both pofteffing certain charac 
teriflics that every objefl man is an objesl animal in a£lual 
fubflance that a is b in magnitude — when we fay a equals 
b and fo on but i admit only the converfe namely that all 
thefe ufes fatisfy the conditions it would hardly be for any one 
to fey that every poffible ufe of is which fatisfies three fuch fim 
ple requirements has been or can be exhaufled even the 
material example which was jufl now given cannot be iden 
tified with any common ufe or eafily imaginable one of the 
common verb but if no invented meaning proper to fatisfy 
the conditions can be found other than already exifls in more 
or lefs of ufe flill thefe conditions are the laws to which the 
word muft fiibmit in its logical acceptation 

there are common ufes of the word which are not admitted 
in logic and among them one of the mofl common conneftion 
of an obje£t with its quality and of an idea with one of its con 
ftituent or aftociated ideas as when we fay the rofe is red 
prudence is deflrable here the logical conditions are not fatis 
fied for example red is the rofe though a poetical inverfion 
of the firfl aftertion is not logically true it is ufual to confider 
fuch propofitions in logic as elliptical y thus the rofe is red is 
confidered as the rofe is ared objeft or an objeft of red colour 
in which the is now takes one of the fenfes which allows of con 
verfion similarly in all other cafes the fubjesl and predicate 
v aire made to take the fame character both names both ideas or 
both obje£s this redu£ion renders unneceftary both the fludy 



of the propqfition 

of the varieties of meaning of the word is meaning varieties out 
of the pale of the conditions above enumerated and alfo that of 
the tranfitions of meaning within the circle of which the infe 
rence remains good 

the moft common ufes of the verb are — firft abfolute iden 
tity as in the thing he fold you is the one i fold him fecondly 
agreement in a certain particular or particulars underftood as 
in he is a negro aid of a european in reference to his colour 
thirdly pofleffion of a quality as in the rofe is red fourthly 
reference of a fpecies to its genus as in man is an animal all 
thefe ufes are independent of the ufe of the verb alone denoting 
exiftence as in man is i e exifts in all thefe fenfes and in 
all which might be dded confiftendy with the conditions in page 
 fome propodtions fometimes admit of having the fenfe of is 
hifted and fome do not thus in negative propofitions the is 
of agreement in particulars may be lawfully converted into that 
of identity if no a is b in colour then abfolutely no a is 
b but every a is b in colour does not prove every a 
is b but the firft paii might be conne£led by a fyllogifm 

the is of agreement in particulars may always be reduced to 
the is of identity by alteration of the predicate thus every a 
is b in colour is every a is a thing having the colour of one 
of the bs when a fyllogifm has a negative conclufion and 
the middle term is or can be made the predicate of both pre 
mifes then the whole fyllogifm can be transformed from one in 
which there is only the is of agreement to one in which there is 
no is but that of identity for example fuppofe the premifes to 
be no x is y in colour every z is y in colour not 
meaning neceflarily that all the ys are of one colour but reading 
it as no x is of the colour of any one of the ys j every z is 
of the colour of one of the ys the conclufion is that no z 
is x in colour or no z is of the colour of any one of the 
xs but from this it follows that no z is x for if any one z 
were abfolutely x it would have the colour of that x this 

• the reader muft not paint any of the letters during the procels the 
fenfe in which we fay a door is the fame door as before after it has been 
painted of a different colour is not the fenfe of logical identity it is the 
fame in all but colour and colouring matter and the is one of agreement 
except as a joke in fufficient anfwer to a captious obje£lion or a trap no 



 on propojitions 

laft conclufion can be brought direflly from altered prenniies 
thus is being that of identity we have no x is a thing hav 
ing the colour of one of the ys every z is a thing having 
the colour of one of the ys therefore no z is x but fup 
pofe we take the following premifes some ys are not xs in 
colour j every y is z in colour from this it follows that 
fome zs are not xs in colour and thence that fome zs are 
not xs but we cannot now alter the premifes fo as to produce 
the laft conclufion from x z and a middle term 



chapter iv 

on propojitions 

a name is a fymbol which is attached to one or more 
objefts of thought on account of fome refemblance or 
community of properties or elfe it is a fymbol attached to 
fome one or more objects of thought to diftinguifh them from 
others having the fame properties objedls of the fame name 
are fo far as that name is concerned undiftinguifhable and 
one obje may have many names as being one in each of many 
claffes of objefts of thought 

names as explained in chapter ii are exclufively the ob 
jefts of formal logic the identity and difference of things is 
defcribed by afferting the right to affert or the right to deny the 
application of names and names whether fimple or complex 
will be reprefented by letters of the alphabet as x y z 

a propofition is the affertion of agreement more or lefe or 
difegreement more or lefs between two names it expreffes 
that of the objefts of thought called xs there are fome which 
are or are not found among the obje£ls of thought called ys 

change whatever muft take place in the terms of conchifion during infe

many black beans it would take to make ten white ones to which he very 
properly anfwered ten if you ikin em but the ten ikinned beans would

that there are objects which have both names or which have 
one but not the other or which have neither 

for the moft part the objess of thought which enter into a 
propofition are fuppofed to be taken not from the whole univerfe 
of poible obje£ls but from fome more definite colle£lion of 
them thus when we fay all animals require air or that 
the name requiring air belongs to every thing to which the name 
animal belongs we fhould underftand that we are fpeaking of 
things on this earth the planets c of which we know no 
thing not being included by the univerfe of a propofltion i 
mean the whole range of names in which it is exprefled or un 
derftood that the names in the propofition are foimd if there 
be no fuch expreion nor underftanding then the univerfe of the 
propofition is the whole range of poffible names if the uni 
verfe being the name u we have a right to fay every x is y 
then we can only extend the univerfe fo as to make it include all 
pofsble names by faying every x which is u is one of the ys 
which are us or fbmething equivalent 

contrary names with reference to any one univerfe are thofe 
which cannot both apply at once but one or other of which al 
ways applies thus the univerfe being man briton and alien 
are contraries the univerfe being property real and perfonal are 
contraries names which are contraries in one univerfe are 
not neceftarily fo in a larger one thus in geometry when the 
univerfe is one plane pairs of ftraight lines are either parallels or 
interfe£lors and never both parallels and interfe£lors are then 
contraries but when the ftudent comes to fblid geometry in 
which all fpace is the univerfe there are lines which are neither 
parallels nor interfe£lors and thefe words are then not contra 
ries but names which are contraries in the larger and contain 
ing univerfe are neceftarily contraries in the fmaller and contained 
unlefe the fmaller univerfe abfblutely exclude one name and then 
the other name is the univerfe 

in future i always underftand fbme one univerfe as being that 
in which all names ufed are wholly contained and alfo which 
it is very important to bear in mind that no one name mentioned 
in a propofition fills this univerfe or applies to everything in it 
nothing is more eafy than to treat the fuppofition of a name 
being the univerfe as an extreme cafe and i hall denote con 



 on proportions 

trades by large and fmall letters thus x being a name x is tht 
contrary name and everything in the univerfe underftood is 
either x or x and nodiing is both 

a propofition may be either jtmple and incomplete or complex 
lnd complete the fimple propofition only aflerts that xs are 
ys or are not ys the complex propofition which always con 
fifts of two fimple ones difpofets in one manner or the other of 
every x and every y thus every x is y is a fimple pro 
pofition but it forms a part of two complex propofitions it 
may belong either to every x is y and every y is x or to 
 every x is y and fome ys are not xs 

the propofitions advanced in common life are ufually com 
plex with one fimple propofition expreffed and one underftood 
feuf books of logic have hitherto confidered only the fimple pro 
pofition and this laft fbould be confidered before the complex 
form 

the fimple propofition muft be confidered with refpel to 
jign relative quantity and order 

simple propofitions are of two jigns affirmative znd negative 
it is either xs are ys or xs are not ys the phrafes are 
and are not or is and is not which mark the diftinftion are 
called copula 

the relative quantity of a propofition has reference to the 
numbers of inftances of the different names which enter it the 
diftinflions of quantity ufually recognized are all znd fome 
leading to the diftinftion of univerfal and particular thus 
 eyery x is y and every x is not y are the univerial affir 
mative and negative propofitions the latter is ufually ftated as 
 no x is y and fome xs are ys arid fome xs are not 
ys are the particular affirmative and negative propofitions and 
when the propofitions are reduced ftriftly to thefe four fornis 

 somey in logic means one or morey it may be all he who fays that 
fome are is npt u be held to mean that te reft are pot some men 
breathe fome horfes are diftlnguiilhable by fliape from their riders would 
be held falfe in common language the reafon is as above noted that 
common language uaially adopts the complex particular proportion and 
implies that fome arc not in faying that fome are the ftudcnt cannot be 
too careful to remember this diftinlion a particular propofition is only a 
 may be particular 



on propojitions j 

the firft named x is called the yyv and the fecond named 
y the predicate 

it has been propofed to coaiider the iiniverfal propofitions as 
definite with refpeft to quantity but this is not quite corres 
the phrafe all xs are ys does not tell us how many xs 
there are but thatj be the unknown number of xs in exiience 
what it may the unknown number mentioned in the propofition 
is the fame that which is definite is the ratio of the number 
of xs of the propofition to the xs of the univerfe so under 
flood however the definite quantity as an abbreviation may be 
faid to belong to univerfals and the indefinitenefs of the parti 
cular propofition is only hypothetical it is in our power to fuj 
pofe thtfiime to be one half of the whole or twothirds or any 
other fraftion 

the quantity of the fubjeft is exprefted that of the predicate 
though not exprefted is neceflarily implied by the meaning of 
language the predicate of an affirmative is particular the 
predicate of a negative is univerfal if i fay xs are ys even 
though i fpeak of dl the xs i only really fpeak of o many ys 
as are compared with xs and found to agree and thefe need 
npt be all the ys every horfe is an animal declares that o 
many horfes as there are to fpeak of fo many animals are fpoken 
of and leaves it wholly unfettled whether there be or be not 
more animals left but if i fhould fay xs are not ys though 
it fhould be only one x as in this x is not a y yet i fpeak of 
every y which exifls the aftertion is this x is not any one 
whatfoever of all the ys in exiflence a perfbn who fhould 
wifh to verify by adlual infpeftion thefe xs are ys might 
perchance be enabled to affirm the refult upon the examination 
of only ys if he came firfl upon the right ones but he 
could not verify this one x is not a y until he had examined 
every y in exiflence this is the common doftrine but though 
admitting of courfe that the affirmative propofition only enables 
us to infer of fbme inflances of the predicate yet i think it more 
correal to fay that the predicate itfelf is fpoken of univerfally but 
indivifibfyj and that in the negative propofition the predicate is 
fpoken of univerfally and divijibly some xs are ys tells 
us that each x mentioned is either the firfl y or the fecond y 
or the third y c no y being excluded from comparifon but 



 on propqfitions 

 some xs are not ys tells us that each x mentioned is abfo 
lutely not the firft y nor the fecond nor the third c is not 
in faft any one of all the ys still however the predicate of 
an affirmative yields no more than it vjrould do if the ys finally 
accepted as xs were fpecially feparated and confidered as the 
only ys poken of 

the relation of the univerfal quantity to the whole quantity of 
inftances in exiftence is definite being that whole quantity itfelf 
but the particular quantity is wholly indefinite some xs are 
ys gives no clue to the fraion of all the xs fpoken of nor to 
the fra£lion which they make of all the ys common language 
makes a certain conventional approach to definitenefe which has 
been thrown away in works of logic some ufually means a 
rather fmall fraction of the whole a larger fraion would be 
expreffed by a good many and fomewhat more than half by 
f moft while a ftill larger proportion would be a great majo 
rity or nearly all a perfe£uy definite particular as to quan 
tity would exprefe how many xs are in exiftence how many 
ys and how many of the xs are or are not ys as in out 
of the xs are among the ys in this chapter i fhall 
treat only the indefinite particular leaving the definite particular 
for future confideration 

the order of a propofition has relation to the choice of fub 
 jeft and predicate thus every x is y and every y is x 
though both eftablifh a univerfal affirmative relation between x 
and y yet are in faft two different propofitions they are called 
converfe forms when the fubjeft and predicate are of the feme 
fort of quantity both univerfal or both particular the converfe 
forms give the fame propofition thus no x is y and no 
y is x are the fame neither has any meaning except perhaps 
of emphafis which the other has not and some xs are ys 
is the fame as some ys are xs the univerfal negative then 
in which both terms are univerfal and the particular affirmative 
in which both are particular — are necejfarily convertible propofi 
tions but the univerfal affirmative in which the fubjest is uni 
verfal and the predicate particular and the particular negative in 
which the fubjeft is particular and the predicate univerfal — are 
not neceffarily convertible and are generally called inconvertible 
they may be convertible in one cafe and inconvertible in an 



on propqfitions 

other but the term inconvertible is not incorreft for the fol 
lowing reafon 

the agreements and difagreements which are treated in logic 
are of this character there can only be agreement with one but 
there may be difagreement with all if this x be a y it is 
one y only it is this x is either the firft y or the fecond 
y or the third y c if there be ys there is to thofe 
who can know it times as much negation as affirmation in 
the propofition and yet moft affuredly it is properly called affir 
mative but if it be this x is not a y we have this x is 
not the firft y and it is not the fecond y and it is not the third 
y c the affirmation is what is commonly called disjunctive 
the negation conjunive a disjunftive negation would be no 
propofition at all except thatcne and the fame thing cannot 
be two different things any x li either not the firft y or not 
the fecond y nd in like manner a conjunctive affirmation 
would be an impoffibility it would ftate that one thing is two 
or more different things 

we muft be prepared then to confider cafes of oppofition in 
which on the one fide there is fixed neceffity and on the other 
fide poffibility of alternatives and we muft be prepared to de 
note thefe by oppofite terms which looking to etymology only 
denote fbced neceffities of oppofite characters this happens in 
the cafe above convertible means abfblutely and neceftarily con 
vertible inconvertible means convertible or inconvertible as the 
cafe may be taking the four forms of one order we find that 
each of the univerfals cannot exift with either propofition of op 
pofite form thus every x is y cannot be true if either 
no x is y or some xs are not ys while no x is y 
cannot be true if either every x is y or some xs are ys 
but each of the particulars is neceftarily inconfiftent with nothing 
but the univerfal of oppofite form that some xs are ys 
cannot be true if no x is y but it may be true if some xs 
are not ys arid some xs are not ys cannot be true if 
 every x is y but it may be true though some xs are 
ys 

the pair every x is y and fome xs are not ys are called 
contradidfory and o are the pair no x is y and some xs 
are ys of each pair of contradictories one muft be true and 



o on proportions 

one muft be falfe fo that the affirmation of either is the denial 
of the other and the denial of either is the affirmation of the 
other the pair every x is y and no x is y are ufually 
called contraries contrariety implying the utmoft extreme of 
contradi£lion contraries may both be falfe but cannot both be 
true the pair some xs are ys and some xs are not ys 
which may both be true but cannot both be falfe are ufually 
cdhed fubcontraries but for reafons hereafter to be given i 
intend to abandon the diftindlion between the words contrary 
and contradisfory and to treat them as fynonymous and the 
proportions ufually called contraries every x is y and no 
x is y i fhall cax fubcontraries while thofe ufually called yi 
contraries some xs are ys and some xs are not ys i hall 
ctii fupercontraries 

i fliall now proceed to an enlarged view of the propofition 
and to the ftrudlure of a notation proper to reprefent its different 
cafes 

as ufual let the univerfal affirmative be denoted by a the par 
ticular affirmative by i the univerfal negative by e and the par 
ticular negative by o this is the extent of the common fym 
bolic expreffionof propofitions i propofe to make the following 
additions for this work let one particular choice of order as 
to fubje£ and predicate be fuppofed eftablifhed as a ftandard of 
reference as to the letters x y z let the order be always 
that of the alphabet xy yz xz let x y z be the con 
trary names of x y z and let the fame order be adopted 
in the ftandard of reference let the four forms when choice 
is made out of x y z be denoted by ai ei ii oi but when 
the choice is made from the contraries let them be denoted by 
a e r o thus with reference to y and z every y is 
z is the ai of that pair and order while every y is z is the 
a i fhould recommend ai and a to be called the fubh and 
the fuperh of the pair and order in queftion the helps which 
this will give the memory will prefently be very apparent and 
the fame of l and i c 

let the following abbreviations be employed — 



xy means every x is y 
xy — some xs are not ys 



x y means no x is y 
x y — some xs are ys 



 



on propojitions

there arc eight diftinft modes independent of contraries in 
which a limple propofition may be made by means of x andy 
thefe eight modes are xy and yx x y and y x x y and 
yx and xy and yx but the eight are equivalent only to 
fix for x y and y x are the fame and fo are xy and yx 
again there are fix fimple propofitions between x and y fix be 
tween x and y fix between x and y taking in contraries 
there are then twentyfour apparent modes of forming a fimple 
propofition from x and y but thefe are not all diftin£ eight 
of them contain all the reft thefe eight being the ai ei l oi

table the ftudy of which fhould be carefully made

i fuppoie moft readers will readily fee the truth of the identities 
here affirmed if not the following laode of illuftration which

 on propofitions 

in the firft fcheme ai there exift twelve us the firft five of 
which are both xs and ys the next three ys but not xs the laft 
four neither xs nor ys this cafe fo conftrufted that xy is 
true fhows xy and yx 

the proportions ai and a xy and xy may be called con 
tranomtnalj as having each names contrary of thofe in the other 
it appears then that as to inconvertibles contranominal and con 
verfe are terms of the fame meaning for xy and yx are the 
fame and xy and yx and fince it is more natural to fpeak 
of direfl names than of their contraries it will be beft to attach 
to a and o the ideas of yx and yx but not fo as to forget 
their derivation from xy and xy obferve alfo that each uni 
verfal propolition has converted contranominals for its affirmative 
forms thus xy yx and though xy is not yx yet if 
we make xy take the affirmative form xy it is equivalent to 
yx in particular proportions the negative forms have the 
feme property the contranominals of the convertible propo 
rtions ei and l are of totally different meaning they have 
ifever till now been introduced into logic and a few words of 
expnation are wanted 

firfl as to i or xy we here exprefs that fome notxs are 
notys or that there ar things in the univerfe which are neither 
xs nor ys that is x and y are not contraries next as to 
e or xy we here exprefs that no notx is noty or that 
everything in the univerfe is either x or y or both thefe lafl 
words are important by omitting them we fhould imagine that 
xy fignifies that x and y are contraries which is not necef 
farily true 

accordingly the eight flandard forms of expreffion with re 
ference to the order x y and exhibited in the form in which it 
will be mofl convenient to think and fpeak of them are as 
follows 

aoryxeveryyisx 
 o or yx some ys are not xs 
 e or xy jno x is y u e or xy everything is either x or y 

c iirxy some xs are ys l iorxy something are neidierxsnorys 

returning to the table we now fee the following general laws 

i each triad of equivalents contains two inconvertibles and one 

convertible of the four x yx y each of the eight forms 



j a or x y every x is y 
 or x y some xs are not y 
e or xy no x is y 



on proportions 



 



fpeaks univerlklly of two and particularly of two a pro 
pofition fpeaks in different ways of each name and its contrary 
univerfally of one and particularly of the other the propo 
fitions called contradictory from the common meaning of this 
word may be fo called in another fenfe for they fpeakin the 
fame manner of contraries thus x y fpeaks univerlklly of x 
and particularly of y its denial xy or yx fpeaks univerfally 
of x and particularly of y 

any two of the eight forms being taken it is clear either that 
they cannot exift together or that one muft exift when the other 
exifts or that one may exift either with or without the other 
the alternatives of each cafe are prefented in the following table

let the concomitants of a propolition be thofe to which ft is 
wholly indifferent then it appears that each univerfal has for 
concomitants its contranominal and the contradiory of the laft 
but each particular has all for concomitants except only its own 
contradi£lory each univerfal denies befides its own contra 
diftory the two univerfals of oppofite name and contains the 
two particulars of the fame name the two concomitants of a 
univerfal may be defcribed as its univerfal and its particular con 
comitant 

there is a certain fort of repetition in our choice of the four 
forms combined with the four fele£ions xy xy xy xy if 
any one of the four forms aiei aebe applied to alt the above 
it will give the four forms derived from xy thus the ai of 
x y xy xy xy are feverally the ai ei a and e of x y 
and the e of x y xy xy and xy are feverally the e a ei 
and ai of xy and fb on it will ferve for exercife to verify 
the above and ftill more the cafes contained in the following 

there are four things in a propofition each of which niay be 
changed into its contrary fubje£l predicate order and copula 
let s be the diredion to change the fubjed into its contrary p 



 on propofitions 

the fame for the predicate let t be the direftion to transform 
the order and f the direflion to change the form from affirma 
tive to negative or from negative to affirmative when t enters 
let it be done laft to avoid confufion thus spt performed 
upon xy gives xy from s xy from p and yx from t 
which is xy fo that in this cafe alteration of fubjefl predicate 
and order is no alteration at all let l be the reprefentation of 
no alteration at all to inveftigate equivalent alterations ob 
ferve firft that f and p fingly are identical thus f performed 
on xy gives xy and p on xy gives xy and xy 
xy this perfeft identity of f and p in effeft remains in 
all combinations into which t does not enter but when t 
enters it is s and f which are identical thus st performed 
on yx gives xy or x y and ft performed on yx gives 
xy the reafon is that t interchanges fubjeft and predicate 
fo that f after t makes a change which is counterbalanced by 
a change in what was the fubjed accordingly remembering 
that each operation performed twice is no operation at all thus 
pp is l and tt is l we have in all cafes 

pf spsf pfl spfs 

stft sptfpt sftt spftpt 

all which fhould be tried for exercife again in a convertible 
propofition transformation is no alteration or tl in an incon 
vertible one transformation changes it into its contranominal 
or tsp now fet out as follows — l in convertible propo 
fitions is t which in inconvertibles is sp which in convertibles 
again is spt which in inconvertible s again is tt or l 
put thefe down as follows writing under them the operations 
which are always equivalent to them as fhewn above 

l t sp spt l 
pf sft sf pft pf 

the combinations written under one another are always the 
fame in efie£i thofe feparated by double lines have the lame 
tstgt on convertibles thofe feparated by fmgle lines have the 
fame efled on inconvertibles again p for convertibles is the 
fame as pt which for inconvertibles is the fame as psp or 
s which for convertibles again is the fame as st which for 
inconvertibles is ssp or p thefe treated as before give the 
table 



on propqfitions 



p 
f 



pt 
spft 



s 
spf 



st 
ft 



p 
f 



in thefe two cycles there are l and all the fifteen feleftions 
which can be ipade out of s p f t and every poffible cafe 
of equivalent changes is contained in thefe two tables thus 
pt is in all cafes equivalent to spft in convertible cafes to 
p and to f in inconvertible ones to s and to spf and no 
other combination is in any cafe equivalent to pt in verifica 
tion of thefe tables obferve that the operation f always occurs 
in the lower line and never in the upper and that this opera 
tion changes convertibles into inconvertibles and vice verfd 
we ought then to expe£l that the equivalences which con 
taining f apply to inconvertibles will be thofe which when f is 
ftruck out apply to convertibles and vice verfd and fo we hall 
find it for inftance spft and spf are equivalent when per 
formed on inconvertibles ftrike out f and we have spt and 
sp which are equivalent when performed on convertibles 

it appears then that any change which can be made on a 
propofition amounts in effeft to l p s or ps this is another 
verification of the preceding table for all our forms may be de 
rived from applying thofe which relate to xy in the cafes of 
xy xy and xy 

we have seen that ai and a both contain l and v and that 
el and e both contain oi and o hence each of the univerfals 
may be faid to be the jirengthened form of either of its particulars 
of the fame fign and each of the particulars the weakened form 
of its univerfals of the feme fign the only diftinftion which 
appears between the two forms of the convertible particulars 
xy and yx xy and yx is that the ftrengthened forms derived 
from extending the fubjefts are different thus xy gives xy or 
yx but yx gives yx or xy 

a complex propofition is one which involves within itfelf the 
aflertionor denial of each and all of the eight fimple propofitions 
if thefe eight propofitions were all concomitants or if any num 
ber of them might be true and the reft falfe there would be 
 poffible cafes of the complex propofition as it is owing 
to the connexion eftablifhed in the table of page there are 
ymtfeven 

f 



 on proportions 

firft let the names x and y be fo related that neither of the 
four univerfals are true then all the four particulars are true 
and this is the firft cafe let it be called a complex particular j 
and denoted by p then denoting coexiftence of fimple pro 
pofitions by writing between their feveral letters we have 

poorii 

this cafe is of the leaft frequent mention in the theory of the 
fyllogifm 

next let one of the univerial propofitions be true then five 
of the other propofitions are fettled either by affirmation or de 
nial there remain the two concomitants which are contra 
diftory fo that only one is true accordingly with the excep 
tion of the complex particular juft defcribed every complex pro 
pofition muft confift of the coexiftence of a univerial and one of 
its concomitants but there are not therefore eight more fuch 
propofitions for a ai and aih a are the fame and fb are 
el e and e ei the remaining number is then reduced 
to fix which are 

a ai a a o 
e r ei f e ii 

thefe muft be feparately examined 

firft take ai a the order x y always underftood we 
have then xy and yx that is there is no obje whatfo 
ever which has one of thefe names but what alfo has the other 
the names x and y are then identical not as names but as 
fubjefts of application where either can be applied there can 
the other alfb thus in geometry the uhiverfe being plane 
re£lilinear figure equilateral and equiangular are identical names 
not that they agree in etymology nor in meaning more than 
this a few words would explain the firft to many who could not 
comprehend the fecond without difficulty but they agree in 
that what figure foever has a right to either name it has the fame 
right to the other it will tend to uniformity of language if we 
call x in this cafe an identical of y and y an identical of x 
let the fymbol of an identical be d then we have 

da a 



on propqfitions 

next take ai o we have then xy and yx every x 
is y and fo far there is a charader of ientity but fome ys 
are not xs there are more ys than xs and x ftops fhort of a 
complete claim of identity with y let x be called zfubideft 
tical of y thus man is a fubidentical of animal and let di de 
note this cafe then 

dai 

let a oi exift we have then yx and x y every y 
is x and fo far there is identity but fome xs are not ys there 
are more xs than ys or x goes beyond a claim of identity vjrith 
y let x be novjr called a fuperidentical of y and let it be 
denoted by d then 

da 

 the terms fuperidentical and fubidentical are obvioufly correla 
tive if x be either of y y is the other of x now let us 
confider ei e we have then x y and xy there is no 
thing which is both x and y there is nothing which is neither 
confequently x and y are contraries or juft fill up the univerfe 
let c be the mark of this relation then 

ce f 

next take ei v we have then x y and xy nothing is 
both x and y but there are things which are neither x and 

y are clear of one another but do not amount to contraries 
for they do not fill up the univerfe let them be called yr 
trarhsj thus in the univerfe metal gold and jilver are fubcontra 
ries and let ci denote the relation then 

ceir 

laftly take e l we have xy and x y the names fill 
the univerfe for there is nothing but what is either x or y 
but they overfill it for fome things arc both xs and ys there 
is then all the completenefs of a contrary and more let x and 

y be cslqfupercontraries and letc denote the relation then 

we have 

cfii 

• the jupercontrary relation though effential to a complete fyftem of 
fyllogifin is not frequently met with the other extreme of the fupercon 



 on propofitions 

to complete our language let ai or xy with reference to the 
order x y be ctwtafubffirmative and a or vykjuperaffirma 
the let ei or x y be cdlleduhnegative and e or xyfuperneg 
ative let the particulars l i and oi o have alfo thefe feveral 
names this extenfion of our language will require a little ex 
planation 

when i fay that x is a fubidentical of y i mean that the 
etymological fuggeftions are aftually fetisfied the whole name 
x and more is contained in y but when i fay that x is a 
univerfal ahaffirmative of y or xy i mean no more than that 
we have the propofition whofe form is not fuperaffirmative ac 
cording to the etymology of that word an algebraift would 
well underftand the diftinftion at a glance he has often to 
diftinguifh the cafe in which a is lefs than b from that in which 
a is lefs than or equal to b the cafe in which the extreme limit 
of the affertion is not included from that in which it is included 

again the word negative had better be viewed as not fo much 
prefenting exclujion for its firft idea as inclujion in the contrary 
thus a fubnegative when univerfal is to fuggeft complete in 
clufion in the contrary meaning the extreme cafe poflibly 
namely that the fubnegative names may be contraries again 
fupernegative is to fuggeft the idea of fupercontrary with the 
loweft extreme the relation of contrary poffibly included 

for exercife in this language and in the ideas which it is 
meant to prefent i now ftate the following refults 

univerfal affirmation though as a general term it is to include 
fuper and fub affirmation yet looked at as one of the three and 
diftinguiflied from the reft it means identity the fame of ne 
gation and contrariety subidentity requires univerfal fubaffir 
mation and particular fupernegation identity is univerfal fub 
and fuper affirmation both superidentity requires univerfal 
fuperaffirmation and particular fubnegation subcontrariety re 
quires univerfal fubnegation and particular fuperaffirmation con 

trary or the fubidentical is fo much the eafieft of all our complex relations 
that the latter rarely allows the former to appear the firft inftance that 
fuggefted itfelf to me was man and irrational defcriptive of the quality of 
the individual and not of the fpecies in the univerfe animal thefe more 
than fill that univerfe icuot being common to both but it is more natural 
to fay that rational in this fenfe is fubidentical of nuut 



on propofitions 



 



trariety is univerfal fub and fuper negation both supercontra 
riety requires univerfal fupernegation and particular fubaffirma 
tion again uriiverfal fubaffirmation is either fubidentity or iden 
tity particular fubaffirmation is a denial of contrariety and fub 
contrariety univerfal fuperaffirmation is either fuperidentity or 
identity particular fuperaffirmation denies contrariety and fiiper 
contrariety univerfal fubnegation is either fubcontrariety or 
contrariety particular fubnegation denies fubidentity and iden 
tity univerfal fupernegation is either fupercontrariety or con 
trariety particular fupernegation denies fuperidentity and iden

every fubidentical of a name is the fubcontrary of its contrary 
every fubcontrary is the fubidentical of the contrary treat the 
word contrary as negative the word identical as pofitive and 
the two as of different figns then the algebraical rule like 
figns give a pofitive unlike figns a negative holds in every cafe 
including the variety of it fb well known as two negatives make 
an affirmative when the modifying prepofition comes firft it 
muft be retained when it comes feconhpit muft be changed 
thus the fubcontrary of a contrary is a fubidentical but the con 
trary of a fubcontrary is a fuperidendcal in putting two rela 
tions together however we have got into fyllogifm as we fhall 
prefendy fee

it is defirable to confider the feveral complex relations as to 
the continuous tranfition from one into another the growth of 
names concerns not only the etymologift but the logician alfb 

with the analogies and affinities by which the dominion of 
one name is extended to inftance after inftance and clafs after 
clafs — and fbmetimes in fcientific language at leaft deprived of 
a part of what it has held — i have here nothing to do it is 
enough that the phenomena exift which may be defcribed as the 
gradual transformation of one relation into another the words 
butt and bottle for example are now fubcontraries in the uni 
verfe receptacle but the etymology of the fecond word fhows 



on propojitions 

that it was fubidentical of the firft being a diminutive and 
if we were to take the whole clafs butt bufs boot bufhel box 
boat bottle pottle c which are all of one origin the number 
of tranfitions would be found to be very large 

i aftume that all the inftances of a name are counted and 
arranged in its univerfe a conceivable though not attainable 
fuppofition alfo that the inftances of the name are arranged 
contiguoufly as in page whatever the reafon may be 
which di£bates the particular arrangement chofen it will generally 
happen that the inftances near to the boundary poftefs the cha 
ra£teriftics of the name in a fmaller degree than thofe nearer the 
middle let the contiguous arrangement be made of all the in 
ftances of the name y the univerfe being u let another name 
x begin t grow commencing with one inftance that is being 
applied to one of the objefts in the univerfe u be it a y or not j 
then to another contiguous and fo on we are to enumerate the 
ways in which fiich changes whether of increafe or diminu 
tion may caufe one name to change its relation to another 
according as the change is made by acceffion or retrenchment 
it may be denoted by or — 

let the name x begin within the limits of the name y its 
initial relation to y is then di and the poffibility of the 
following continuous changes is obvious 

di d d d p c 
di p d di pci 

hence di may become d through either d or p but ci or c 
only through p next let x begin without the limits of y 
the initial relation is ci we may have then 

c cc cpd 

ci p c c p d 

let x be both within and without y its initial relation is 
then p and we have 

pd pc pd pc 

but when — follows di or d ci or c we have nothing 
except 

dd ddi cc cc 



 on propqitions 

if we begin at the other extreme with the name u we have 

u d u c 

beginning from d and c we have 

ddd dpc 

 pd dpc 

c c c c p d 

c p c c p d 

but when follows d or d c or c we have only 
dd dd cc cc 

from the above lift it appears that the tranfition which is ac 
companied by a change of prepofition only can be made either 
through the letter without prepofition or through p and in all 
cafes with one continued mode of alteration but when the tranc 
ition involves change of letter it can only be made through p 
with continuation of the mode of alteration when the prepofi 
tions are different and change in the mode when they are the 
fame the following fucceffions contain the arrangement of the

the following confiderations will further ferve to illuftrate the 
want of the extenfion of the doctrine of propofidons made in 
this chapter and alfo the completenefs of it among our moft 
fundamental diftin£lions is that oi necejjity xa fufficiency i of 
what we cannot do without and what we can do with of that 
which mui precede and that which can follow the contraries 
of thefe are nonnecejjity and nonfufficiency in thefe four words 
applied to both y and y we have the defcription of the eight re 



on propofitions 

lations of x to y for inftance ai or xy tells us that to 
have an x we muft take a y or to be x it is necejfary to be

and the convertibility of the ordinary mode of defcription with 
this new one may be eafily hown in any cafe for example 
what can we mean by faying that to take a x it is not fufficient 
to take what is not y clearly that by taking not y or y we 
may at the feme time take a x or that there are xs which are ys 
and fo on for the reft 

of the four pairs xy xy xy xy we know that each

ne£b them with names more deicriptive of the meaning and to 
adopt thefe laft whether we rejefl or maintain their fynonymes 
when x y the relation of x to y is well imderftood as 
that of the jfpecies to the genus we may adopt thefe words 
with the underftanding that the word fpecies includes the 
extreme cafe in which the fpecies is as extenflve as the genus 
when x y we may call x a nonfpecies of y and y a nongenus 
of x when x y we may call x an exclufiue or excludent of 
y or elfe a nonparticipant and alfo y of x when xy we 
may fay that each is participant or nonexclujive of the other 
when x y which means that x and y together fill up or more 
than fill up the univere we may fay that they are complemental 
names when xy which only means that x and y do not be

the following exercifes in thefe terms really contain the de 
fcripdon of all the fyllogifms in the next chapter 

inclufion in the qecies is inclufion in the genus and inclufion 
of the genus is inclufion of its parts fpecies or not 

exclufion from the genus is exclufion from the fpecies and ex 
clufion of the genus is exclufion of its parts fpecies or not 

inclufion or exclufion of the fpecies is part inclufion or exclu 
fion of the genus 

when the fpecies is complemental fo is the genus and when 
the genus is not complemental neither is the fpecies 

exclufion from one complement is inclufion in the other 

complements of the fame are participants 



 on the syllogifm 

two fpecies of one genus are not complements neither are 
two exclufions from the fame 

the complement of a genus is a nonfpecies j and the com 
plement is a nonfpecies of the noncomplement 



chapter v 

on the syllogifm 

a syllogism is the inference of the relation between 
two names from the relation of each of thofe names to a 
third three names therefore are involved the two which ap 
pear in the conclufion and the third or middle term with which 
the names or terms of the conclufion are feverally compared 
the ftatements expreffing the relations of the two concluding 
terms to the middle term are the two premifes in this chapter 
no ratio of quantities is confidered except the definite all and the 
indefinite fome 

a fyllogifm may be cither mple or complex a fyuogifm is 
jimple when in it two fimple propofition produce the affirmation 
or denial of a third or the affirmation of a third we may fay 
fince every denial of one fimple propofition is the affirmation 
of another a complex fyllogifm is one in which two complex 
propofitions produce the affirmation or denial of a third complex 
propofition 

it might be fuppofed that we ought to begin with the fimple 
fyllogifm and from thence proceed to the complex on this 
point i have fome remarks to offer in juftification of following 
precifely the reverfe plan 

hitherto the complex fyllogifm has never made its appearance 
in a work on logic except in one particular cafe in which it is 
allowed to be treated as a fimple fyllogifm though moft obvioufly 
it is not fo i allude to the common a fortiori argument as in 
 a is greater than b b is greater than c therefore a is greater 
than c there is no middle term here the predicate of the 
firft propofition is a thing greater than b the fubje£b of the 
fecond propofition is b 

admitting fully that the quality of the premifes — that which 



on the syllogifm yy 

entitles the conclufion to be made as it is faid a fortiori — marks 
this argument out as if anything ftronger clearer and could 
fuch a thing be truer than a fimple fyuogifm yet it is plain 
that the very additional circumftance on which this additional 
cleamefs depends takes the argument out of a fyuogifm as de 
fined by all writers by beginning with the complex fyuogifm 
and thence defcending to the fimple one it wiu be feen that we 
begin with cafes which prefent this a fortiori and clearer charac 
ter i think i fhau fbew that the complex fyuogifm is eafier 
than the fimple one 

next the fyuogifm hitherto confidered has never involved any 
contrary terms the confequence of which has been that various 
legitimate modes of inference have been neglefted moreover 
feveral of the ufual fyuogifms are more ftrong than need be in 
the premifes in order to produce the conclufion thus yx 
and yz being admitted as premifes the neceflary conclufion is 
 xz but if yx be weakened into y the fame conclufion 
 follows if we call a fyuogifm ywww when neither of its 
premifes are ftronger than is neceflfary to produce the conclufion 
it is obvious that every fundamental fyuogifm which has a parti 
cular premife gives at leaft as ftrong a conclufion when that 
particular is ftrengthened into a univerfal but except when 
ftrengthening the premife alfo enables us to ftrengthen the con 
clufion in which cafe we have a new and different fyuogifm it 
feems hardly fyftematic to mix with fundamental arguments fyl 
logifms which have quality or quantity more than is neceflary for 
the conclufion 

the ufe of the complex fyuogifm will as we fhall fee give 
an independent and fyftematic derivation to thefe ftrengthened 
fyuogifms as well as to the reft 

let x and z be the terms of the conclufion and let y be 
the middle term let the premife in which x and y are com 
pared come firft of the two let the order of reference in each 
cafe be that of the alphabet 

xy yz xz 

so that by ftating what x is with refpe£k to y and what y is 
with refpeft to z our fyuogifm involves the ftatement of what 
x therefore muft be or therefore cannot be with refpeft to z 
we can in every cafe exprefs the refult in fimple words thus 



 on the syllogifm 

one of our fyuogifms being what i hall reprefent by dididi is 
as follows if x be a fubidentical of y and y a fubidentical of 
z then x is a fubidentical of z but all this merely amounts 
to the following a fubidentical of a fubidentical is a fubidentical 
we have then to examine every way in which di or d or ci 
or c can be combined with di or d or ci or c giving fixteen 
cafes in all and all conclufive in one way or the other inftead 
of taking an accidental order and afterwards claffifying the re 
fults it will be better to predift the order which will give claffi 
fication that order will be to take i a d followed by another 
of the ame prepofition a c followed by another of different 
prepotition a d followed by another of a different prepofition 
 a c followed by another of a like prepofition this arrange 
ment gives us 



 dd dd dc dc 

 cid cdi cic cc 



 dd dd dc dci 

 cid cd cici cc 

each of thefe cafes will be examined by a method fimilar to that 
propofed in page but a clear perception of the meaning of 
the words will at once di£bate the fixteen refults which are as 
follows preceded by the mode in which the fyuogifms are to 
be exprefted 

dididi subidentical of fubidentical is fubidentical 

ddd superidentical of fuperidentical is fuperidentical 

dicici subidentical of fiibcontraiy is fubcontrary 

dcc superidentical of fupercontrary is fupercontrary 

cidci subcontrary of fuperidentical is fiibcontrary 

cdic supercontrary of fiibidentical is fupercontrary 

cicdi subcontrary of fupercontrary is fubidentical 

ccid supercontrary of fubcontrary is fuperidentical 

didc subidentical of fuperidentical is not fupercontrary 

ddr ci superidentical of fubidentical is not fiibcontrary 

dicd subidentical of fupercontrary is not fuperidentical 

dcrdi superidentical of fubcontrary is not fubidentical 

cidrd subcontrary of fubidentical is not fuperidentical 

cddi supercontrary of fuperidentical is not fubidentical 

gcr g subcontrary of fubcontrary is not fupercontrary 

ccci supercontr of fupercontrary is not fubcontrary 



on the syllogifm 

in the denials the extreme limit is included in the affirma 
tions it is not thus not fiiperidentical and not fubidentical 
both include not identical and the fame of contraries in the 
affirmations extreme limitation of one premife does not alter the 
conclufion but that of both reduces the conclufion to its extreme 
limit thus 

subcontraiy of identical is fubcontrary 
contrary of fuperidentical is fubcontrary 
contrary of identical is contrary 

and fo on the rules of this fpecies of fyllogifm are as follows 
for affirmatory conclujions — i like names in the premifes give 
d in the conclufion and unlike names c d in the firft 
premife requires premifes of the fame prepofition c in the firfl 
premife of different prepofitions the prepofition of the 
conclufion agrees with that of the firft premife for negatory 
conclujions the preceding rules are reverfed thefe rules will do 
for the prefent but they afterwards merge in others 

the fixteen forms of complex conclufion above given are of 
the clearnefs of axioms as fbon as the terms are diftin£uy appre 
hended the following diagrams will affift and fhould be ufed 
until the propofitions fuggeft their own meaning though there 
be four yet thefe four are really but one as will be fhown

o on the syllogifm 

in each diagram are three lines pardy thick and partly open 
thefe are meant to be laid over one anqjlier but are kept feparate 
for diftinftnefs a point on the firft line fignifies a x or a 
and one on the fecond or third a y or a y and az or a z 
the univerfe of the propoiitions is fuppofed to be the whole 
breadth points which come under one another are fuppofed to 
reprefent the fame objeft of thought varioufly named thus 
in the firft diagram when the thick lines contain the points 
named x y and z it is hown that we mean to fay there are 
objefts to which all the three names apply for there are points 
under one another in the thick part of all the three lines 

when we read by the letters on the left the thick lines are 
meant to reprefent the parts in which the xs ys and zs muff 
be placed and when by thofe on the right the open lines 
accordingly looking at the third diagram and at the left we fee 
ci d ci while in the diagram it is clear that x is a fubcon 
trary of y or that x y and x y and that y is a fuperidentical 
of z or that z y and y z and the conclufion is equally 
manifeft namely that x is a fubcontrary of z but looking at 
the left and feeing c di c we take the open parts to reprefent 
the fpaces in which xs ys and zs are found and the thick 
parts for thofe in which xs ys and zs are found here then we 
fee that x is a fupercontrary of y that y is a fubidentical of z 
and that confequently x is a fupercontrary of z 

some attempts at laying down the premifes fo as to evade the 
conclufions will be inftruftive to any one who does not imme 
diately fee the latter and formal demonftration is always prac 
ticable thus if x be a fubcontrary of y that is if x and y 
do not fill the univerfe and have nothing in common and if y 
be a fuperidentical of z or entirely contain z without being 
filled by it then it is clear that x muft be more a fubcontrary 
of z than of y by all the inftances which there are of a y not 
being a z the diagram however is fo much clearer than this 
fort of demonftration that the reader until he has great com 
mand of the language may as well look to the former to fee that 
he is right in the latter 

it may be convenient as a matter of language to fpeak of a 
name as a kind of colle£live whole confifting of inftances and 
thus we may talk of one name being entirely in another or 
partly in and partly out c as in h we have already done 



on the syllogifm 

all the complex iyllogifms which conclude by affirmation are 
lbvioufly of the a fortiori chara£ler i hould rather fay thofe 
 y of the firft three diagrams properly and obvioufly thofe of the 
fourth by an eafy extenfion of language the marks i in the 
middle of the diagrams how how this is in the firft on the 
left x is more of a fubidentical of z than it is of y the in 
ftances in which itsyaidentity appears confift of all thofe which 
prove the fubidentity of x to y together with all thofe which 
prove the fubidentity of y to z in the third read from the 
right x is more fupercontrary to z than it is to y by all the 
inftances which fliow the fubidentity of y to z in the fourth 
diagram from the left we cannot fay that x is more fubidentical 
of z than of fomthing elfe fimply becaufe there is no previous 
fubidentity among the relations but ftill the diftinguifliing 
charafteriftic of the conclufion takes its quantity from the addi 
tion of thofe of both the premifes 

if either of the premifes be brought to the limit which fepa 
rates it from the relation of an oppofite prepofition that is if 
c or ci be changed into c or elfe d or di into d the nature 
of the conclufion is not altered except by the lofs of the afor 
tiori charaer one of the quantities which have hitherto con 
tributed to the quantity of the conclufion now difeppears thus 
ci d gives ci as well as ci d and c d gives ci as well as 
ci d j ci c gives di as well as ci c 

let one of the premifes pafs over the limit and take the oppo 
fite prepofition choofe ci d which gives ci and continues 
to give it though weakened when the firft ci becomes c then 
let ci become c fo that our premifes are c d the dia 
gram is then as follows 

x 

cdy 




the quantity of the conclufion now depends upon the differ 
ence between the number of inftances in and and its 
quality upon whether has fewer inftances than or the 
fame number or more as i have drawn it ci is the conclufion 
ftill ftrengthen the firft premife ftill more and the conclufion 



 on the syllogifm 

will pafs through c into c or elfe into p and in the fecond 
cafe may pafs into d as in the following diagram 



xl 



cd y 
z 



nothing is impoisble except di or d hence c d enables 
us only to deny di and its limit d treat the other cafes in the 
fame manner and remembering that denial is to include denial 
up to the limit while affirmation only affirms to any thing fliort 
of the limit we have 

di d denies c d di denies ci 

dg d dci di 

cid d cd di 

ci ci • c c c • • ci 

the rules given above in page may be couefted from the 
inftances 

as long as we keep contraries out of view the ultimate ele 
ment of inference is of a twofold charafter it is either x and 
z are both y therefore x is z or elfe x is y and z is not 
y therefore x is not z x y z being fingle inftances of 
three names and y the fame inftance in both premifes but the 
ufe of contraries enables us to give an affirmative form to the latter 
cafe it is x is y and notz is y therefore x is notz 

connefted with this change of expreffion is the following 
theorem that all the eight affirmatory complex fyllogifms are 
reducible to any one among them and the fame of the negatory 
ones the reader may trace this theorem to the order of the 
figures i being the fame in all the four diagrams taking 
dididi as the moft fimple and natural form and looking at the 
diagram of gdci we fee the laft as dididi in x is fubi 
dentical of y y is fubidentical of z therefore x is fubidentical 
of z if we write the terms of the fyllogifm after its defcriptive 
letters as in dididi x yz we have the following refults — 



dididi xyzddid xyz 
dicici xyzddidi xyz 
cidcixyzdididi xyz 
ccdi xyzdiddi xyz 



ddd xyzdidid xyz 
dcc xyzdididixyz 
cdic xyzdidid xyz 
ccd xyzddid xyz 



on the syllogifm 

thinking of the firft defcription only as to relations and of the 
fecond only as to terms we fee the following rules of connexion 
in the firft and fecond premifes and terms there are x and y 
in the terms or their contraries according as there are fub 
accents or fuperaccents in the relations but in the conclufion 
the term is z for di and c z for d and ci and we may 
thus reduce any fyllogifm involving any one of the eight varieties 
of relation combined with any one of the varieties of terms 
either to didid or to x yz thus cidc xyz is didid 
xyz or dicici xyz not to load the fubjeft with de 
monftration of forms i will give at once the general rules by 
which changes of accent and letter are governed remarking 
that they apply throughout the whole of my fyftem 

the varieties in queftion are eight 

xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz 

in which thinking of xyz all are kept or all changed or 
one only kept or one only changed learn to conneft each 
letter with the propofitions in which it occurs marking the pro 
pofitions premifes and qonclufion as i conneft x with 
 y with z with keeping all or changing all 
makes no alteration of letters keeping only one or changing 
only one alters the letters in the premifes in which that one 
occurs thus be the accents what they may if in ddd we 
change only the firft letter into its contrary the fyllogifm becomes 
cdc and the fame if we keep only the firft letter unchanged 
as to accents remember that change of z produces no eflfeft 
look then only at x and y when either letter is changed into 
its contrary change the accents belonging to the premifes in 
which that letter comes firft for x for y for xy 
for example what is cicdi xyz here as to letters x 
alone is unchanged thn ccd becomes dcc as to 
accents y is changed which comes firft only in change c 
into ci hence cicdi xyzdcici xyz here we 
have pafted from a fyllogifm in xyz to the correfponding equi 
valent in xyz the rules equally hold for the inverfe procefs 
and for all combinations of letters for the change of xyz 
into xyz and that of xyz into xyz have only one defcription 
the firft only left unchanged now fiippofe it required to know 



 on the syllogifm 

what fyllogifm in xyz anfwers to dicicixyz the key words 
are y third only unchanged alter then dcc into ddd by the 
firft rule and change all the accents thus dicicixyz 
dddxyz the independent rules are that change of fub 
jeft only changes both letter and accent predicate only letter 
fubjeft and predicate accent thus to find what dccxyz 
is exprefled in xyz the changes are in the three premifes s 
neither s and dccxyzccdixyz the following 
table may be verified for exercife it fhows the effeft of all 
changes except that of the middle term

similarly ddd would have cdc dcc c when 
the middle term only is changed the table may ftand thus j — 

xyz dididi cdic dcici ccid

it will of courfe have been obferyed that the eight fyllogifms 
go in pairs each one of a pair differing from the odier in acceny 
tuation and nothing elfe when we take fets of four the ones 
put together fhould be thofe in which the firfl premife or the 
fecond or the conclufion whichever we take for a flandard 
has di and c or elfe has d and ci 

the fame rules of transformation apply to negatory complex 
fyllogifms thus ddicixyz is cddixyz in fed thefe 
rules do not depend upon the character of the inference nor even 
upon its validity but merely on the effefts produced in the fingle 
propofitions by changes of term thus the flatement ddici 
xyz an invalid inference is the fame flatement equally in 
valid of courfe as is exprefted in dicdxyz 

an examination of the complex particular relation piir 
 oi o whether by the diagram or by unaffifled thought will 
fhow that when this relation exifls between x and y it alfo exifls 
between x and y x and y x and y hence pc cp pd dp 



on the syllogifm 

give p moreover two complex particulars give no poffibility 
of any conclufion all being equally pofsble thus pp may give 
ci or c or c or di or d or d 

now combine one of the others as di with p examine pdi 
and dip it will be found that the complex particular of a fub 
identical may be either complex particular fubidentical or fuper 
contrary j or that pdi may be either p di or c examine all 
the cafes and the rules will be found in 

dcp pdc 
dcp pcd 

thus interpreted either premife from between the parenthefes 
with p in order as written may have either and muft have one 
of the three for its conclufion that dip muft give either di 
ci or p and fo muft cip but pci muft have either p ci or d 

before proceeding to the fimple fyllogifm as i have called it 
i will ftate that i much doubt the propriety of the terms jimple 
and complex undoubtedly the phrafes are hiftorically juft for 
each of the fyllogifms which i propofe to call complex is as 
we fliall fee neceflarily compofed of three of thofe which are 
always called jimple but in another point of view the phrafe 
ology ought to be reverfed the fimple fyuogifm is the affirma 
tion of the exiftence of one out of feveral of the complex ones 
thus xyyzxz or aiaiai is reauy di or d not 
known which di or d not known which dj or d not 
known which and aflerts that there is either didadi or diddi 
or ddidi or ddd 

but it will be faid furely the complex propofition requires the 
conjunsfive exiftence of two fimple ones diaij and is 
therefore compound at leaft i anfwer that on the other hand 
the fimple propofition requires the disjunsfive exiftence of two 
complex ones as aidi or d which is moft fimple both or 
one or the other to me i think the firft certainly the fyllo 
gifm dididi is one which i more readily apprehend than ai ai ai 
indeed to moft minds the latter is the former if they are left 
to themfelves and the cafes diddi c are only admitted when 
produced and infifted on 

but further is the fimple propofition properly called fimple 
is there in it but one afltertion to deny or admit is but one 



 on the syllogifm 

queftion anfwered when i affirm every x is y i affirm 
i comparifbn of x and y coincidences the greateft 
poffible amount of them that every x has been ufed in ob 
taining them in some xs are ys the firft two of the preced 
ing are employed in no x is y we have i comparifon 
of xs and ys exclufions the greateft amount the 
comparifon of every x with every y and some xs are not 
ys omits the third and fubftitutes xs for every x in the fourth 

now the fubidentical for inftance only contains befides what 
is in the fubaffirmative the notion that there are more ys than 
xs in exiftence the fubcontrary confifts over and above what 
is in the fubnegative in that xs and ys are not every thing that 
the propofition might have applied to and fo on on thefe 
confiderations i think it may be allowed to treat the words am 
ple and complex as only of hiftorical reference and to confider 
the firft as disjundlively connedled with the fecond the fecond 
as conjunftively connefted with the firft in the manner above 
noted i think i fliall make it clear enough that the paflage 
from the conjundlions to the disjunctions is better fuited to a 
demonftrative fyftem than the converfe if the plan which i 
propofe ftiould gain any reception i ftiould imagine that disjunc 
tive and conjunsfive would be the names given to the clafles 
which i have called fimple and complex the conjunftive com 
pofed of feveral of the disjunftive the disjunftive confifting of 
one or the other out of feveral of the conjunftive 

when a propofition r is the neceflary confequence of two 
others p and q it neceflarily follows that the denial of r muft 
be the denial of one at leaft of p and q for every propofition 
admits but of affirmation or denial and he who affirms both p 
and qmuft affirm r if then p be affirmed and r denied the 
denial of q muft follow if q be affirmed and r denied the 
denial of p muft follow 

k fimple fyllogifm is one the two premifes and conclufion of 
which are to be found among the fimple propofitions ai ei l 
oi a e r o thus we have aee or xy yz 
xz as an inftance the order of reference is always xy 
yz xz 

the following theorems will be neceflary — i a particular 
premife cannot be followed by a univerfal conclufion 



on the syllogijm 

if poflible let aji for example have a univerfal conclufion 
take the complex premifes dip or aiiir oi 
all that can be inferred is that one of ar conclufions page 
is valid and neither d nor c either di or p or ci but if a 
univerfal be true one of two conclufions muft be valid page 
and one of them d or c if then ai and l alone yielded a 
univerial conclufion quite as much muft dip or a form which 
is indifferent to three conclufions and not having d nor c is ne 
ceffarily produftive of one of two conclufions one of which is 
d or c this contradiuon cannot exift or ajr cannot yield 
a univerial conclufion 

 from two particular premifes no conclufion can follow 

if poffible let iji yield a conclufion j which by the laft the 
orem muft be only particular now pp or l i oi o 
ii oi o is indifferent to all complex conclufions quite 
as much is iji but if thefe premifes yield a particular conclu 
fion two complex conclufions are denied page this con 
tradiftion cannot exift or particular premifes can yield no 
conclufion 

let a fimple fyuogifm with premifes and conclufion all univer 
fal be called univerfal and with either premife and therefore 
the conclufion particular be called particular then every 
univerfal fyuogifm has two particular fyuogifms deducible from it 
thus if ai£i£i be valid then ai joined with the denial of ei 
gives the denial of ei or adihfeems to be valid but the altera 
tion of the places of the propofitions requires us to fay that it is 
alil which is valid and this point requires clofe attention 

take aee or xy yzxz then xy with the 

denial of xzor xz gives the denial of yzor yz j and 

we have 

xyxzyz 

this is valid if the firft be as it is valid but its fymbol is not 
aill for the middle term is in our notation made middle in 
the order of reference which is therefore yx xz yz and 
the fyllogifm is all similarly we have 

xz yzxy 

produced by coupling the denial of xz with yz but this is 
iieioi for the order of reference is now xz zy xy and 



 on the syllogifm 

el is not changed by change of order the rule is as follows 
when the denials of the conclufion and of a premife are made to 
take the places of that premife and the conclufion the order of 
reference remains undifturbed as to the tranfpofed terms and is 
changed as to the ftanding term this laft muft therefore have 
the prepofition of the inconvertible propofition changed but 
not that of the convertible propofition 

thus eaie if valid gives eto and iat again in a 
fimilar way it may be fhown that from each particular fyuogifm 
follows a univerfal thus leo if valid fhows that denial of 
o and e give denial of l or aeei in this cafe neither is 
valid and etoi befides eaie alfo gives ajt 

such claffification of thefe opponent forms as is ufefiil will pre 
fently be given 

since there are eight forms of aisertion with reference to each 
of the orders x y yz it follows that there are fixtyfour com 
binations of a pair of premifes each but of thefe the only ones 
which have a chance of yielding a conclufion are i fixteen 
with premifes both univerfal thirtytwo with one univerfal 
and one particular if for a moment u ftand for univerfal and 
p for particular the form of a fyuogifm is either uuuj pupj 
upp or uup of thefe the firft fecond and third are fo 
related that each form has the other two for its opponents but 
he fourth has its own form in each of its opponents 

now examine one of the complex affirmative fyuogifms ay 
dididi by the diagram in page the premifes are ai o 
and ai o giving the four combinations ai ai aio oai and 
cyo the conclufion is ai o but it is not merely twofold 
but threefold for the afhrtiori charafter explained in page 
fhows that o is obtainable on two different grounds and is the 
film as it were of two different and neceftary parts of the con 
clufion that every x is z follows from xy d yz or 
we hav the fyuogifm 

aiaia xyhyzxz 

but as far as the zs which are below are concerned it 
fouows that they are not xs becaiife they are the ys which are 
pot xs or we have 

cy yxyzzx 



on the syllogifm 

and as to the zs below they are not xs becaufe they are 
not ys among which are all the xs accordingly we have 

aioo xy zyzx 

or dididi requires the coexiftenceof aaa oaio aioo 
apply this realbning to the contraries x y z or elfe examine 
ddd in the fame way and we find that ddd requires the 
coexiftence of aaa a aoo 

by applying the preceding refults to x y z c as in page 
 or as is better at firft by examining all the cafes of the dia 
gram in page we get the following table of derivations from 
the eight affirmatory complex iyllogifins the firft column 
hews the terms which muft be ufed to deduce all from dididi

before forming any rule or making any remark i proceed to 



 on the syllogifm 

coueft the refults of the remaining cafes and firft let a pre 
mife be brought to its limit d or c fay that dididi becomes 
ddidi in the diagram it immediately appears that one of the 
particular conclufions is loft not contradifted but nullified for 
 difappears becaufe x and y are identical names that is 
aiaiai remains and aioo but the concluiion of oaio is 
nullified but this very circumftance creates not a new conclu 
fion for it is only a part of one already exifting but a new form 
of deduftion the premifes are now ai f a and ai f o and 
the conclufion is ai o the fyllogifms aiai ai and aioo 
are as before and for the me reafons but there is now the 
combination aai among the premifes which produces the con 
clufion l and we have 

aaji yx yzxz 

this fyuogifm though new as far as dididi is concerned is 
only a ftrengthened form of laji a concomitant of eaie 
for page l is true whenever a is true fo that aai in 
cludes iiai and its necefltary confequence l but if l had been 
ftrengthened into ai inftead of a we fliould have had aiaji 
which though perfe£uy valid yet admits of a ftronger conclu 
fion as feen in aiaiai 

of the two modes of ftrengthening a particular propofition 
as ii into ai or a there is one which ftrengthens the quantity 
of the firft form of the propofition and another that of the fecond 
thus xy or l becomes xy or ai when the firft form and 
yx or a when the fecond form is ftrengthened similarly 
oi or xy becomes xy or ei and yx or e according as 
the form ftrengthened is xy or yx the prepofition remains 
the fame or changes according as the firft or fecond form is 
ftrengthened if thefry form of xh fecond premife of a fyuo 
gifm or the fecond form oftheri premife be ftrengthened no 
ftrength is added to the conclufion thus as far as the fyllo 
gifms in this chapter are concerned lai gives as much as aai 
and eioi as eiei but if the firft form of the firft premifs or 
the fecond form of the fecond be ftrengthened the conclufion 
has its firft form ftrengthened 

a very fimple and obvious theorem contains all thefe refults 
the concluding terms are in our order of reference the firft 



on the syllogifm 

term of the firft premiie and the fecond term of the fecond the 
concludon is never ftrengthened by augmenting the quantity of 
the middle term nor only weakened it may be altogether de 
ftroyed by weakening the middle term a wider field of com 
pariibn does not by itfelf give more comparifons nor can more 
comparifons arife except by augmenting the number of things 
compared in that field since the conclufion can obvioufly 
fpeak of no more than was in the premifes no term of that con 
clufion can be augmented in quantity until the fame thing has 
taken place in its premife but no flrengthening of a propofi 
tion flrengthens both terms confequently to make fuch a thing 
effedlive it mufl be the concluding and not the middle term 
which is ftrengthened 

the following table is only worth inferting as a coueftion of 
exercifes the fourth column fhows the titjirengthenedpar 
ticular fyllogifms as i will call them having univerfal premifes but 
only a particular conclufion not flronger than might have been 
inferred from the particular fyllogifm itfelf

i will now examine the negatory complex fyllogifms premiling 
however than we cannot get any new conclufions from them 



 on the syllogifm 

for we have now got all the fixteen cafes in which both pre 
mifes are univerfal and we know that there can be no fyllogifm 
with a particular premife except it have one of thofe with uni 
verfal premifes for its opponents 

take didc or a o and a oi together deny e l 
that is deny the coexiftence of e and l that is deny either e 
or ii that is affert either i or ei this fyllogifm then may be 
written thus 

ai o a o either e or t 

now the fai is that this disjundlion is fuperfluous it is i 
which is always aflerted and ei is never a neceffary confequence 
of dd for aia gives i as already fliown and aioi and 
oaare inconclufive and ooi of courfe and the rationale 
of the inference is as follows fince x is a fubidentical of y and 
y a fuperidentical of z it follows that y is fuperidentical both of 
x and z confequently y not filling the univerfe our fuppo 
fition throughout it follows that there are things which are nei 
ther xs nor zs namely all which are not ys again in 
cicrc which the fame reafoning fhows to be only cicif 
none either of x or of z is in y therefore every inflance in y 
is both x and z and thus it will appear that in every negatory 
complex concluilon the whole middle term or the whole of its 
contrary makes the fubjeft matter of the ftrengthened particular 
fyllogifm which is all that can be couedted 

our conclufion is that no negatory complex fyllogifm is of 
any more logical effeft than the ftrengthened particular derived 
from it thus we may fay that fb far as the extent and cha 
rafter of the inference is concerned the former is the latter 

i will now pals to the general rules of the complete fyftem of 
fyuogifms — 

the reader muft take pains to remember two rules of forma 
tion perfeft contraries of each other for the dependence of the 
accents or prepojitions on the jign affirmative or negative cha 
rafter of the lirft premife i exprefs them in the briefeft way 
poflible 

diresf rule affirmation in the lirft premife makes the fecond 
premife agree with both the other proportions or ifolates no 
thing negation makes the fecond premife differ from both the 



on the syllogifm 

others or ifolates the fecond premife inverfe rule affirmation 
ifolates the firji premife makes the firft premife diflfer from both 
the others in prepofition negation ifolates the conclujion makes 
the conclufion differ from both the others thefe rules might 
be exprefled fo as to make their contrariety more complete 

thus in the rule affirmative commencement fhows 
prepodtions in the two premifes and the conclufion ru j® 
n the firft premife in prepofition but negative commence 
ment fhows prepofitions in the two premifes and the con 
clufion s with g premife in prepofition 
aiiienng rrom 

the fubjefts of the followinjg rules are 

 the eight affirmatory complex fyllogifms 

 the eight univerfal fimple fyllogifms 

 the eight ftrengthened particular fimple fyllogifms 
 the fixteen particular fimple fyllogifms 

omit the negatory complex fyllogifms as fully contained in 
the third of this enumeration and the complex fyllogifms which 
contain the unaccented d or c as carrying a momentary accent 
for the rule to be expunged when the formation is completed 
confider di d d ai a ii i as of the affirmative figns and 
ci c c el e oi o as negative 

rule i in the complex fyuogifm all parts are complex in 
the univerfal fimple fyllogifm all parts are univerfal in the 
ftrengthened particular only the conclufion is particular in the 
particular only a premife is univerfal 

rule premifes of like fign have an affirmative conclufion 
of unlike fign a negative 

rule the complex the univerfal the particulars which 
begin with a particular follow the direft rule the ftrengthened 
particulars and the particulars which begin with a univerfal all 
that commence with a univerfal and conclude with a particular 
follow the inverfe rule or thus all which begin and end 
alike follow the dire£b rule all which begin and end differently 
the inverfe 

the complex fyllogifins and univerfals are eafily remembered 



 on the syllogifm 

by rule the particulars almoft as eafily the following fub 
rules may be noted as far as thefe laft are concerned 

subrule i firji and fecond premifes a and o in the firft 
premife demand unlike prepodtions in the two premifes £ and 
i demand like prepofitions thus aioi muft be inconclufive 
aio muft be conclufive but eioi muft be concluftve and 
eio muft be inconclufive 

subrule firji premife and conclujion a univerfal in the firft 
premife demands an unlike prepofition in the conclufion a par 
ticular firft premife a like prepofition in the conclufion 

subrule second premife and conclufion every fecond pre 
mife demands its own prepofition in a conclufion of like fign 
and the other prepofition in a conclufion of unlike fign 

as far as the four fpecies are concerned every fyuogifm 
formed according to the three rules is valid and every one 
not fo formed is invalid the following remarks are partly 
recapitulatory partly new 

remark i every complex fyllogifm gives one univerfal fyuo 
gifm and two particular ones its concomitants and the con 
comitants are formed by changing one of the premifes of the 
univerfal and the conclufion into their particular concomitant 
propofitions page 

remark every fyllogifm has its contranominal which aflerts 
of the contraries in the fame manner as the firft does of the di 
reft terms and contranominals have all their accents different 
as in oaio and oiaoi page 

remark every fyllogifm has two opponents made by inter 
changing the contradiftories of one premife and of the conclufion 
and altering the accent of the remaining premife if inconverti 
ble a or o page 

remark every complex fyllogifm has two fuch opponents 
formed in the fame way the ds being the inconvertibles the cs 
the convertibles thus meaning denial of the opponents of 
cidci are cicid and cidici the firft of thefe is 

e riireoora 

containing the valid fyllogifms eieai ejio ieo j being 

 syuogifm not preceded by complex means iimple fyllogifm 



on the syllogifm 

eieai and its concomitants and cidici gives eaie the 
contranominal of eiaei and its concomitants and the fame 
of the reft 

remark each univerfal fyllogifm has two weakened forms 
made by weakening one premife and the conclufion when the 
firji premife is weakened it is without change of prepofition 
but when the fecond with change thus the weakened forms 
of eiaei are oaoi and eil 

remark each particular fyllogifm has two ftrengthened 
forms one of which is a univerfal the other only a ftrengthened 
particular thus the ftrengthened forms of oiaoi are eiaei 
and eaoi 

remark in every fyllogifm except the ftrengthened particu 
lar the middle term is univerfal in one premife and particular in 
the other and its contrary is therefore the fame but in the 
ftrengthened particular the middle term is univerfal in both 
premifes or particular in both this affords a complete crite 
rion of fyllogifm as will be noticed hereafter in faft the com 
pletenefe of this fyftem crowds us with relations from many of 
which general rules might be deduced though they need only 
appear here by cafual remark 

in oaio aoo iai eor oej all ie 
eiiio the middle term enters univerfally in the univerfal and 
particularly in the particular in all the others it enters particu 
larly in the univerfal and univerfally in the particular in the 
firft fet the convertible premifes are all fubs the inconvertibles 
are fubs in the fecond premife zni fupers in the firft in the 
fecond fet thefe rules are inverted 

remark of the twelve poffible pairs of premifes aa ae 
ai ao ea ee ei eo la ie o a oe which can give 
a conclufion each one w in two ways which two ways are 
inverted in their accents thus eo appears in eol and 
eioj the two premifeletters and one acdnt diftate all the 
reft thus ia can belong to nothing but tat when the 
fyftem is well learnt it will be found unneceffary to write more 
than ia for the fymbol of iap i now fpeak only of funda 
mental fyllogifms the ftrengthened fyllogifm aiat might be 
fignified by a a 

remark the fyllogifms of the three firft claffes are all really 



 on the syllogifm 

fpecimens of one thofe of the fourth of two among them with 
the eight variations xyz xyz x yz xyz xyz xyz xyz 
xyz the rules for conducing thefe changes are 

change of fubjeft is change of both accent and letter 
change of predicate is change of letter 

change of both is change of accent 

thus to pafs from eeia to ai£iei we note in xy change of 
fubjeft in yz change of neither in xz change of fubjeft 
therefore xyz is the fet of terms into which xyz muft be 
changed and the eeia fyuogifm of either fet is the aieie 
fyuogifm of the other 

the fyuogifms which are with reference to the order 
xy yz xz are only i if the order zy yx zx be 
allowed thus ajt of the firft is the tat of the fecond 
thefe fyuogifms are eflentially the feme in the mode of inference 
they afford to change a fyuogifm into another of the fame mode 
of inference invert the premifes and change the prepofition of 
all the inconvertibles thus aoioi and oaio are of the fame 
inference the pairs which in this point of view are identical are

the ninth remark admits of confiderable extenfion the fome 
of a logical propofitionmay have a much more definite charafter 
in fome cafes than in others it may be a felefted or at leaft a 
diflinguifhableyi which want nothing but a nominal diflinftion 
to make the particular propofition eafily and ufefuuy univerial 
whether it can be done more or lefs eafily and more or lefs ufe 
fuuy is no queflion of formal logic if it be fuppofed done the 
particular is converted into a univerfal in fome xs are ys 
if we make a rtame for every x which is y fay m we have 
then every m is y this propofition may be purely identi 
cal or it may not if we call every x which is y by the name 
m merely becaufe it is y then our univerfal is only every x 
which is thy but if the name m be conferred from any 
other circumflance which diflinguifhes the xs that are ys from 
other xs then the change from the particular to the univerfal by 



on the syllogifm 

means of the new reftriuon impofed by the new name is the 
expreffion of new knowledge 

the quantities in the conclufion are of two kinds there are 
thofe which are brought in with the terms and which continue 
in the concluiion fuch as they were introduced in the premifes 
and there are thofe which depend on the union of the premifes 
and which are what they are only in virtue of the joint exiftence 
of the premifes for example in ii aji we have fome xs are 
ys but every y is z therefore fome xs are zs if we aflc 
what xs are zs the anfwer is thofe which are ys and no others 
fo far as this conclufion affirms but when we look at oaio 
or fome ys are not xs and every y is z therefore fome zs 
are not xs and if we then afk what zs are not xs the anfwer 
is that this quantity does not enter with z but depends upon the 
other premife namely upon the number of ys which are not xs 
in a particular fyuogifm let us call the quantity of the fubje£l 
in the concluiion intrinjic or extrinjic according as it is that of 
the premife which introduces that fubjeft or of the other premife 
examination will fhow that in every particular fyuogifm which 
concludes in l or t in which both terms are particular the 
quantities of the terms are of the one intrinfic of the other ex 
trinfic but that where the conclufion is in oi oro either the 
quantity of the fubje£t is intrinfic and that of the contrary of the 
predicate extrinfic or vice verfd 

when the quantity of a particular term in the conclufion is 
intrinfic the invention of a name will convert the syllogifm into 
a univerfal thus laiai or x y yz xz if m be taken 
to reprefent all thofe xs which are ys and nothing elfe becomes 
myf yzmy of the form a a a again oaio or 
yx yzzx thrown into the form xy zysxz be 
comes my zymz of the form eiaiei when the xs which 
are ys are diflinguifhed from the refl of the univerfe by the name 
m there is nothing either illegitimate or uncommon in diflin 
guiihing by a peculiar name certain fome or even uncertain fome 
if certainly always the fame fome of another name again fince 
we know that every univerfal fyllogifm is reducible to the form 
aiaiai by ufe of contraries we have now reafon to know that 
there is no fundamental inference of the kind treated in this chap 
ter which is any other than that in aaa or the contained 

h 



 



on the syuogifm 



of the contained is contained and there is no better exercife than 
learning to read off each of the fyllogifms univerfal and particu 
lar into this one form by perception and without ufe of rules 
take as an inftance xyyzxz what is the container 
what is the contained and what is the middle container of one 
and contained of theother it is a pared of xs which are con 
tained in y all y in z and therefore that parcel of xs in z 

this general principle fuggefts a notation for all the complex 
univerfel and fundamental particular fyllogifms if we abbre 
viate xy yzxz into xyz and if we denote by 
xyz without that it is only a parcel of xs all or fome 
defined or undefined but always the fame we have the fol 
lowing

here ufmg pqr as general terms pqr denotes that all 
ps are qs and all qs are rs whence all ps are rs while 
pqr only denotes that there is a parcel of ps among the qs 
and all qs are among the rs whence that parcel of ps is among 
the rs 

the rules for the connexion of thefe fyftems are not compli 
cated confidering the extent of the cafes they are to include 
let the letters ae c be called proponents xyz nominal 
and by the order of the nominals we always mean that x is firft 
c both in xyz and zyx the nominals being dire 
xyz and contrary xyz remember thatfy 



on the syllogifm 

ffiri fift d fecond 

an affirmativeyrd proponent denotes that t fecond and third 

third third and firft 

nominals agree are both diredl or both contrary 

ifirjl fifl fecond 

a negativeyjrfd proponent denotes that thexyrw and third 
third third and firft 

nominals differ are one direft one contrary 

thus eio muft give xyz or xyz or zyx or zyx 
leo muft give x yz or xyz or zyx or zyx 

secondly whether the middle term be y or y depends only on 
the accent of the middle proponent a fubzccent gives y a 
jiiperzccent gives y in the univerfal fyuogifm however either 
gives either 

thirdly the xyz fyllogifms are the particulars which begin 
with a particular and the zyx iyllogifms are the particulars 
which begin with a univerfal 

for example required oiei seeing the particular oi at the 
beginning take the order xyz feeing the fuperaccent in e 
make it xyz seeing the negative oi let the exifting difagree 
ment of the firft and fecond nominals continue and the fame of 
the fecond and third from the negative ei confequently xyz 
is the fyllogifhi exprefted in nominals or the rationale of 
the inference in oieii is that a parcel of xs are among the zs 
becaufe among the ys which are all among the zs 

again required the nominal mode of expreffing etoi see 
ing the univerfal e at the beginning write down zyx for the 
fuperaccent in p write down zyx for the negative in e 
continue yx for the afisrmadve in i write zy hence zyx is 
the nominal form of etoi 

required the proponent mode of expreffing x yz here xy 
yz fliow us that the premifes are negative forms and the direc 
tion of the order x y z that the firft premife is particular 
then oe are the premifes and i the conclufion and y tells 
us that the middle proponent has a fubaccent whence oej 
is fo fer as it goes the proponent expreflion and by the laws 
of form the other accents muft be as in oej fince the fyuo 
gifm follows the dire£ rule page 



 oo on the syllogifm 

required the proponent mode of exprefng zyx here we 
note in fuccefson — univerfal commencement — firft premife ne 
gative — fecond affirmative — middle accent fub this gives eiio 
of the inverfe rule or e jjo 

required the proponent notation for the univerlal xyz or 
zyx we fee at once eaje or eaie 

the concomitants of a univerial are found by changing the 
firil nominal into the coatrary in each of the forms and throw 
ing away the fign of univerfality thus the concomitants 
of xyz or zyx are xyz and zyx 

the weakened forms of a univerfal are found by merely 
throwing away the fymbol of univerfality from the two 
forms of the univerfal thus the weakened forms of xyz 
which is alfo zyx are xyz and xyx 

but we have not yet reached the climax of fymbolic fimplicity 
in the mere reprefentation of fyllogifms an algebraift would 
fay that the ftrudture of the inference as now confidered does 
not depend upon the names but only upon their reference to 
the names in the fundamental form xyz he would there 
fore propofe a fimple fymbol to reprefent letting alone and 
another to reprefent changing into the contrary thefe with a 
fign of complete univerfality and another of inverfion of order 
are all that he would find neceflary let o and i fignify letting 
alone and changing into the contrary let the terminal parenthefis 
denote complete univerfality as before and let inverfion of order 
be denoted by a negative fign prefixed thus xyz or laji 
would be denoted by ooo zjrx or ajoo by— on aieiei 
or xyz by ooi or its equivalent— on thus— on tells us 
that fome of the zs are ys all the ys are xs whence fome of the 
zs are xs to write its proponent form obferve that — inftrufb 
us to write a univerial firil to make it affirmative i in the 
middle to fuperaccent the middle propofition oi to make the 
fecond premife negative we have then aioo or xy 
zyzx which is zyfyxzx as aiterted 

all that relates to univerfals in the preceding applies to the 
complex fyllogifms let a couple of parentheies imply a complex 
fyllogifm thus dididi may be xyz or ooo then in oio 
or xyz we are to fee that x is a fubidentical of y and y of z 
whence x is the fame of z but xy and yz warn us to write 



on the syllogifm i o i 

cmtraries for the firft and fecond premifes and y to fuperaccent 
the middle letter whence cicd is the fyuogifm expreflfed by 
the names xyz the equivalent forms — loi and zyx ex 
prefe it by faying that z is a fubidentical of y and y of x whence 
z is a fubidentical of x 

i now look at the ftrengthened particular fyuogifms all in 
ference which is fundamental that is which will come from 
nothing weaker than the premifes given has been reduced to the 
one eai cafe of the contained of the contained is contained 
the ftrengthened particular the type of which is aa ji obeying 
the inverfe rulfe of formation and written at more length in yx 
•f yzxz may be ftated thus all names are common as to 
what they contain in common if we denote this ftrengthened 
fyllogifm by xyzi a fymbol intended to imply fomething be 
tween xyz and xyz in the amounts of quantity introduced 
we fliall find that the eight ftrengthened fyuogifms muft be re 
preiented by 

aaiii xyz aiar xyzl 
aeioixyzl aie xyzi 
eaoixyzl eaio xyzi 
eeii xyzi eej xyzl 

the rules of connexion are precifely thofe for the particular 
fyuogifms and inverfion is abfblutely ineffedive thus xyzi 
zyxi 

a few words will ferve to difpofe of the mixed complex fylltn 
gifms in which a complex preniife is combined with a ample one 
univerlal or particular firft when a complex and a univerfal 
are premifed and figns and accents are as in the diresf rule page 
 the conclufion is as it would be if the a were heightened 
into d or e into c thus eid gives c the fame as cjd 
for el is c or ci and both cd and ciiy give d but with 
different quantities but if the premifes be conftru£led on the 
inverfe rule there is no more inference than can be obtained 
when the complex premife is lowered into a univerfal or we 
have only a ftrengthened particular thus in dje or ajh 
e ae gives the ftrengthened particular aieo and of 
is inconclufive and when the complex premife is combined 
with a particular we have only what would follow if the com 
plex premife were lowered into a univerfal thus dj or 



i on the syllogifm 

afor can only give ajt and dt or a oir gives no 
conclufion for at is inconclufive 

the clafefication of opponent forms may be thus treated 
we know that opponent forms of aee for inftance be it ai 
ee or aee muft be leo and ail now whether aieiei 
fliall have leioi or eilo whether alji or lail depends upon 
the introdu£tion of a new and arbitrary notion of the order to be 
adopted our firft fyuogifm being defcribed by xy yz xz 
the opponent which ends in the contradi£tion of the firft premife 
is in xz yz xy which keeping z middle is either to be 
defcribed with reference to xz zy xy or to yz zx yx 
now in adopting the firft of thefe three orders there is nothing 
which compels us therefore to prefer thle fecond to the third or 
vice verfa 

the effed of the change of order which confifts in the inter 
change of z and x is as follows the premifes change places 
a and o with altered accents altered alfo in the conclufion e 
and i with unaltered accents thus ajt becomes i at 
eoii becomes oiel accordingly it is matter of new ar 
rangement whether for inftance leioi or ejio fliall be called 
the opponent of aieiei and i prefer to give the name to both 
the confequence is the following diftribution of opponents — 

aa ao oa 



ee eo oe 



ae ea ai la ei ie 



the three fets reprefent letters combined in reprefentation of pre 
mifes the firft two containing fix fyllogifms each the third 
twelve the third muft be divided into two fets of fix each in 
one of which the fubaccents are in greater number in the other 
the fuperaccents there are then four fets in all pick any 
two out of a fet which only differ in change of order thefe two 
have the fame opponent forms namely the other four of the 
fet for inftance alji and laii in which fubaccents predo 
minate take ae ea ei ie and complete fyllogifms in 
fuch manner as to make fubaccents predominate giving aieiei 
eiaei eilo leioi the laft four are the opponents of the 
firft two 

in the fet of ftrengthened particulars the opponent forms will 
be found to be univerfals weakened in the conclufion without 



on the syvogtfm ixy 

being weakened in the premifes thus aiai has aeo for 
one of its opponents but ae may produce the univerlal con 
duflon e as well as its weaker form 

some readers particularly thofe who have a tindture of algebra 
are more helped by fymbolic notation than by language with 
others it is the converfe to fuit the latter obferve that the 
language of page may eaflly be adapted to fimple fyllofins 
thus ai being fubafermation l may be fbme fubafermation o 
may be fome fupernegation and fo on thus inftead of eioi we 
may fay that fupernegation of fbme fiiperaffirmation gives fbme 
fubnegatipn pra£iice in this language would make the phrafe 
fuggeft fomethmg more than the notation it is derived from 
the phrafe refers to z there is a term partially fuperaffirmed 
of z namely y and a complete fubnegative of y namely x 
the partial fubaffirmation declares fome things neither y nor z 
the complete fupernegation declares that whatever is not y is x 
confequently there are fome xs which are not zs or x is a 
partial fubnegative of z this fubje£t will be refumed 



in what precedes are two views of the dedu£ion of all tlie 
varieties of fyuogifm the firft taking the complex fyllogifm as 
the fource conne£ts the flrengthened fyllogifms and the parti 
cular ones with the univerfals and thus in h reduces every 
thing to the conilituents of dididi or dddi the fecond pro 
ceeds from ai ai ai a aji aiit and l ail and forms the claftes 
of univerfal ftrengthened and particular fyllogifms by fubfli 
tudng contraries in every way in which it can be done thefe 
two fyftems have clofe connexion but not fo clofe as might 
perhaps be thought for laji is not one of thofe which are 
connected with aiaiai in the formation of a complex fyllo 
gifm 

the two new views which i now proceed to ve are alfo 
clofely conne£ted and different from the former ones in which 
we held it equally admiffible to refer one of the concludmg terms 
to the middle as in xy or the middle to one of the concluding 
terms as in yx but now i afk whether it be not poflible fo 



i on the syllogifm 

to conftru£t the fyftem that we may firft lay down the middle 
term and its contrary as conftituting the univerfe of the fyuo 
gifm and then complete the premifes and their conclufion by 
properly laying down the concluding terms in their daces we 
may fucceed if in the firft inftance we confider none but con 
vertible propofitions and this we can do for univerlal ex 
clufion and particular inclufion comprehend all aflertion thus 
univerfal inclufion is only univerfal exclufion from the contrary 
and particular exclufion is only particular inclufion in the con 
trary 

setting out then with the middle term and its contrary and 
reftridling ourfelves to e and i let e fignify univerfal exclu 
fion from the middle term and e firom its contrary let i fignify 
particular inclufion in the middle term and i in its contrary 
choofing a pair of concluding terms we reje£t ii li and ii on 
grounds already demonftrated and very eafily feen in this view 
and proceed to confider ee ee and ee ei and ei ei and el 

ee from this a univerfal conclufion muft follow if one 
term be completely excluded from the middle and the other from 
its contrary the terms are completely excluded each from the 
other the fundamental forms are 

eiaexy zyxz aee xyzyxz 

and by ufe of xz xz xz xz we thus bring out the eight uni 
verfal fyllogifms 

ee and ee from thefe a particular inclufion muft follow 
exclufion of both terms from a third gives partial inclufion of 
their contraries in each other for all that third term belongs 
to the contraries of the other two the fundamental forms 
are 

eieif xyhzyxz aat xy zyxz 

from which as before the eight ftrengthened fyllogifms are de 
duced 

ei and ei from thefe a particular inclufion muft follow 
the exclufion of one term from a third and the inclufion of 
part of a fecond term in that third tell us that part of the par 
ticularized term is in the contrary of the univerfalized term 
the fundamental forms are 



on the syllogifm 

ejo xy zy zx aioo xy zy zx 
ieioxy hzyxz oaoixy hzyxz 

from which the fixteen particular iyllogifms are deduced 

ei and el from thefe no conclufion can be drawn all that 
is fignified is that one concluding term is wholly excluded froth 
a third and the fecond partially excluded or included in the 
contrary 

it thus appears that a fyuogifm with one particular premife is 
valid when the premifes reduced to convertible forms fliow the 
middle term in both or the contrary of it in both otherwife 
invalid alio that the conclufion in its convertible form takes 
dire£hy from the particular premife and contrariwife from the 
univerfal 

it alfo appears that a fyuogifm with both premifes univerfal is 
always valid with a univerfal conclufion when the premifes 
made convertible how one the middle term and the other its 
contrary with a particular conclufion when both how the mid 
dle term or both its contrary and the convertible form of the 
conclufion takes dire£ly from both in the firft cafe and contra 
riwife from both in the fecond 

the other view which i here propofe is really a different 
mode of looking at that jufl given by the time we have made 
every name carry its contrary as a matter of courfe we become 
prepared to take the following view of the nature of a propofi 
tion a name by itfelf is a found or a fymbol its relation to 
things be they obje£ls or ideas is twofold there may be in 
rerum natura that to which the name applies or there may not 
i do not here fpeak of how many things there may be to which 
a name applies it is not effential to kfiow whether they be more 
or fewer either abfblutely or relatively the introdudtion of 
contraries may be made the expulfion of quantity with refer 
ence to application then let a name be called pojjible or impof 
fihle according as the thing to which it applies can be found or 

not 

a name may be compounded of others the compound name 
being that of everjrthing to which all the components apply 
thus wild animal is the name of all things to which both the 
names wild and animal apply to call this compound name 






io on the syllogifm 

impofsble is to fay that there is not fuch a thing as a wild animal 
to call it pofble is to fay that there is fuch a thmg 

x and y being two names the compound name may be re 
prefented by x y when poffible and by xy when impoffible 
this does not alter the meaning of our fymbol xy as hitherto 
ufed as yet it has been there are xs which are ys and now 
it is xy the name of that which is both x and y is the 
name of fome thing or things and thefe two are the me in 
meaning fo far as their ufe in inference is concerned nor need 
xy as juft defined be treated as a departure from otherwife 
than as an extenfion of the ufe of xy in xy we altert 
that x is fomething namely y in x we aflfert that x is nothing 
whatever the proper notation however for indicating that 
the name x has no application is xu u being the contrary of 
u which laft includes everything in the univerfe fpoken of b 
that u may denote nonexiftence 

the propofition every x is y afferts that xy is the name 
of nothing or x yxy similarly no x is y afferts that 
xy is the name of nothing or xyxy but some xs 
are ys and some xs are not ys merely aflert the poffibility 
of the names x y and xy 

a fyllogifm then is the aflfertion that from the poffibility or 
impoffibility of the names produced by compounding x or x 
z or z each with y or y may be inferred the poffibility or im 
poffibility of a name compounded of x or x with z or z the 
rules of the laft fyftem are now fo eafily changed into the lan 
guage of the prefent one that it is hardly worth while to ftate 
more than one for example thus if x compounded with y 
and z compounded with y both give impoffible names then x 
compounded with z gives an impoffible name this is x y f 
zyzx or xyhzyzx or eiae 

the view here taken of compound names will be extended 
in the next chapter 



on the syltogifm 



chapter vi 

on the syllogifm 

when the premifes of a fyllogifin are true the conclufion 
is alfo true and when the conclufion is falfe one or 
both of the premifes are falfe there are two kinds of modifica 
tions which it may be ufeful to confider thofe which concern 
the entrance of the propofitlon into the argument and thofe 
which aife£ the connexion of the fubje£t and predicate 

as to the propofition itfelf it may be true or falfe abfblutely 
or it may have any degree of truth credibility or probability 
this relation will be hereafter confidered and according to the 
principles of chapter ix b far as the propofition is probable 
it is credible and fb r as it is credible it is true but as to 
other modes of looking at the iyllogifm are we entitled to fay 
that every thing which can be announced as to the premifes may 
be announced in the fame fenfe as to the conclufion the an 
fwer is that we cannot make fuch announcement abfblutely but 
of the premifes as derived from that conclufion we can make it 
in what manner foever two premifes are applicable their conclu 
fion as from thofe premifes is alfb applicable becaufe the conclu 
fion is in the premifes for inflance in the fyllogifm all men are 
trees all trees are rational therefore all men are rational the 
premifes are abfurd and falfe and the conclufion taken indepen 
dently is rational and true but that conclufion as from thofe 
premifes is as abfurd as the premifes themfelves again in all 
pirates are convidted all convi£ls are punifhed therefore all 
pirates are punifhed the premifes are defirable and fb is the 
conclufion with thofe premifes but the conclufion is not de 
firable in itfelf as that pirates fhould be punifhed with or with 
out trial neither may we fay x ought to be y and y ought 
to be z therefore x ought to be z except in this manner that 
we aferm x ought to be z in a particular way we may not 
even fay that when x ought to be y and y j z it follows 
that x ought to be z for it may be that y ought not to be z 
thus a royalifl in would fay that the hundred excluded 



io on the syllogifm 

members of cromwells parliament ought to be allowed to take 
their feats and alfo that ajl who took any feats in that parliament 
were rebels but he would not infer that the hundred members 
ought to be rebels there is nothing which being the property 
of the premifes is neceflarily the independent property of the 
conclufion except abfolute truth it fhould be noted that in 
common language and writing the ufual meaning of conclufions 
is that they are ftated as of their premifes and to ftand or fall 
with them even as to truth though a conclufion may be true 
when its premifes are falfe the proponent does not mean for the 
moft part to claim more than his premifes will give nor that 
any thing fhould ftand longer than the premifes ftand 

next we are not to argue from what we may fey of a propo 
fition to what we may fay of the inftances it contains except as 
to what concerns the truth of thofe inftances or elfe to what 
concerns the inftances as parts of a whole if i ay every x 
is y i aflert no doubt of each x independently of the reft 
that is the truth of every x is y involves the truth of this 
x is y but if to take fomething elfe i maintain every x 
is y to be adefirable rule i do not therefore aflert this x is 
y to be a deflrable cafe except upon an implied neceflity that 
there fhould be a rule and if i ay that every x is y is 
unintelligible i do not fay that this x is y is unintelligible 
and b on thus where there muft be a rule as in law eviery 
mans houfe is his caftle is defirable becaufe there is but one 
alternative no mans houfe c but the propoition by itfelf 
may not be deiirable as to the inftance of a generally reputed 
thief or receiver 

there is one cafe however in which a term cannot be ap 
plied to the general propofition unlefs it can be applied in a 
higher degree to the inftances the propofition every x is y 
cannot be announced as of any degree of probability unlefs each 
inftance has a much higher degree of probability if tt v c 
be the probabilities of the feveral inftances fuppoied independent 
that of the propofition chapter ix is favp which produfl muft 
be les than that of any one of the fra£tions of which it is formed 

i now come to the corifideration of circumftances which mo 
diy the internal ftruaure of the premifes themfelves and firft 
of conditions 



¦v 



 



on the syllogifm 

a conditional propofition is only a grammatical variation of 
the ordinary one as in if it be x then it is y the common 
form of this every x is y is called categoricaly or predicative 
of the two forms categorical and conditional either may always 
be reduced to the other as follows 

 every x is y or if x then it is y 
 no x is y or if x then it is not y 

the particular proportions might be given conditionally in 
various ways but the transformation is not fo common thus 
 fome xs are ys might be if x then it may be y or if x 
then y muft not therefore be denied of it c 

of the two common fubjeslmatters of names ideas and 
propoiitions it is moil common to apply the categorical form to 
the firft and the conditional form to the fecond in truth we 
might call the conditional form a grammatical convenience for 
the exprefson of dependence of propofitions on one another 
and of names which require complicated forms of exprefson 
thus in pages and the conditional forms containing if are 
more fimple than the correfponding categorical forms 

a condition may be either necejfary ov fufficient or both a 
neceflfary condition is that without which the thing cannot be a 
fiifecient condition is one with which the thing muft be in 
pages have fufficiently pointed out the completenefs of 
the connexion between the conditional and the categorical forms 
in any one cafe the fufecient muft contain all that is neceflary 
and may contain more 

after what is faid in page it is not neceflary to dwell on 
the reduction of a conditional iyllogifm to a categorical one 
the premifes contain the conclufion whatever gives us the 
premifes gives us the conclufion but i think that the reduc 
tion of conditional to categorical forms though juft and for in 
ference complete is not the reprefentation of the whole of what 
paftes in our minds 

as an example of what i mean look forward to the nume 
rical fyftem of chapter viii precedent to all propofitions 

 wallis as far as i know was the firft who aflerted that all fyllogifms 
are or can be made categorical he did this in the fecond thefis attached 
to his logic headed syllogifmi hypothetici aliique compqfiti referendi funt 
omnes ad ariftotelicos categoricorum modos 



no on the syllogijm 

there are the numerical conditions which prefcribe the limits of 
the univerfe under confideration say there are inftances in 
that univerfe this is the firft condition of thefe are xs and 
 are ys giving a econd and third condition if we take a 
propofition as x y and ak whether it be fpurious or not we 
have reference to the three conditions underftood but this is not 
neceffary for it would be poffible categorically to exprefs thefe 
conditions by oxs out of in a univerfe of inftances 
containing oys are to be found among thofe ys it is 
of courfe the rule of brevity not to drag about thefe conditions 
with every propofition which is employed but rather to ftate 
them once for all there is however bmething more the 
conditions are a reftridtion upon the arguments intended to be 
introduced and a reftri£ion throughout the attachment of 
them to each individual propofition does not exprelsthis if they 
be feen in twenty confecutive propofitions there is no more than 
a prefumpdon that they are to be feen in the twentyfirft it is 
better that the limits allowed fhould be marked out by one boun 
dary than that the feveral arguments fhould each have a defcrip 
tion of the boundary to itfelf 

juft as a univerfe of names is defined by fpecifying one or 
more names to conftitute collelively xjtiqfummum genus or uni 
verfe fb one of propofitions may be defined by ftadng propofi 
tions which are to be true or which are not to be contradicted as 
the cafe may be thefe propofitions may be conditions preced 
ing all or fome only of the premife which are ufed in argu 
ment or fome may precede fome and others others in 
analyfing arguments it would be found that many propofitions 
which enter as premifes enter each with a condition underftood 
and well underftood to be granted whatever the conditions 
may be fo long as the confequent propofitions a£t logically toge 
ther to produce the final refult then that fame refult depends at 
laft only on the conditions and muft be afisrmed when the con 
ditions and their connexion with their confequents are affirmed 
but then it muft be underftood that the refult alfo ftands upon 
the conditions and may fall with them let us now examine 
the common fyllogifm and fee whether there be any preceding 
conditions on which the refult depends 

on looking into any writer on logic we fhall fee that exiftence 



on the syljogifm 

is claimed for the fignifications of all the names never in the 
ftatement of a proportion do we find any room left for the alter 
native fuppofe there jhould be no fuch things exiftence as ob 
je£ts or exiftence as ideas is tacitly claimed for the terms of 
every iyllogifm the exiftence of an idea we muft grant when 
ever it is diftinsly apprehended and therefore not felfcontra 
didlory we cannot for inftance admit the notion of a lamp 
which is both metal and not metal but as an idea we are at 
liberty to figure to ourfelves fuch a lamp as that with which 
aladdin made his fortune an attempt at a felfcontradi£ting 
idea is no idea we have not that apprehenfion of it in which an 
idea confifts but in no other way can we fay that the attempt 
to produce an idea fails it may then be more convenient here 
to dwell on ohjesfive definition of terms as more eaflly con 
ceived with relation to exiftence and nonexiftence accordingly 
let us take the propofitions xy and x y of the character of 
which the particulars muft partake as to the point before us 
by the meaning of y in relation to y it follows that every thing 
is either y or y if we fay that y does not exift then every thing 
is y if then x exift and y do not the propofition x y or 
xy is falfe and xy or xy is true if neither x nor y 
exift i will not fo far imitate fome of the queftions of the fchools 
as to attempt to fettle what nonexifting things agree or difagree 
if y exift but not x then yx is certainly true but not thence 
xy for when x is as here the whole univerfe the proof of 
yxxy foils to prefent intelligible ideas that is fails to be a 
proof but yx or y x is true 

if all my readers were mathematicians i might purfue thefe 
extreme cafes as having intereft on account of their analogy 
with the extreme cafes which the entrance of zero and of infinite 
magnitude oblige him to confider but as thofe who are not 
madiematicians would not be interefted in the analogy and thofe 
who are can purfue the fubjedt for themfelves i will go on to 
fay that the preceding order is not the natural one we cannot 
to ufeful purpofe laying down the truth of the propofition yfy 
then proceed to enquire how the nonexiftence of one or both 
terms affels the propofition the exiftence of the terms muft 
be firft fettled and then the truth or falfehood of the propofition 
the affirmative propofition requires the exiftence of both terms 



 on the syllogifm 

the negative propofition of one being neceflarily true if the 
other term do not exiil and depending upon the matter as 
ufual if it do exift 

let us make the exiftence of the terms to be preceding con 
ditions of the proportions the fyllogifm aiaiai is then as 
follows 

if x and y both exift every x is y 

if z alfo exift every y is z 

therefore if x y z all exift every x is z 

as to the concluding terms x and z they remain as it were 
to tell their own ftory whatever conditions accompany their 
introdudtion unto the premifes thefe ame conditions may be 
conceived to accompany them in the conclufion but the middle 
term difappears and not bowing itfelf in the conclufion the 
conditions which accompany it muft be exprefely preferved 
the conclufion then is every x is z if y exift which may be 
thrown into theform of a dilemma either every x is z or y 
does not exift 

but taking x and z to exift let us confider the following fyl 
logifm as it appears to be 

every x is y if y exift 
every y if y exift is z 
therefore every x is z 

if this be not a valid fyuogifnj what expreffed law of the ordi 
nary treatifes does it break the middle term a curious one is 
ftriduy middle but there is no rule for excluding middle terms 
of a certain degree of angularity that it does break and very 
obvioufly an implied rule i grant and as to this work the 
rule laid down in chapter iii is broken in its fecond condition 
page the two ufes of the word is do not amount to one 
fuch ufe as is made in the conclufion that x is conditionally 
y which is on the feme condition z gives that x is on the 
fame condition z accordingly the abfblute conclufion is only 
true upon fuch conditions as give the middle term abfolute ex 
iftence 

but it muft be particularly noted that it is enough if this ex 



on the syllogifm 

iftence be given to the middle term by the fulfilment of the 
conditions which precede the entrance of one of the concluding 
terms the condition of the aft of inference is that the com 
panion muft be really made if the terms to be compared with 
the middle term really exiil or which is the fame if the condi 
tions upder which they are to enter be fatisfied the other terms 
being ready there muft then be a real middle term and there 
will be if the mere entrance of one of the concluding terms be 
proof of the exiftence of a middle term while if the other terms 
cannot be brought in from nonexiftence there is no occafion to 
inquire about a middle term for it is otherwife known that the 
comparifon cannot be completed i will take two concrete 
ififtances in the firil of which one of the concluding terms if 
exifting is held to furnifh a middle term as real as itfelf and in 
the fecond of which no fuch fuppofition occurs of courfe i have 
nothing here to do with the truth of the premifes 

philip francis if the author of junius was an accufer whofe 
filence was fimultaneous with a government appointment an 
accufer c reflefts difgrace upon the government if they knew 
that their nominee was the accufer therefore francis if c 
reflefts difgrace upon government if c 

homer if there were fuch a perfon was a perfedl poet if 
ever there were one a perfeft poet if c is faultlefs in 
morals therefore homer if c was faultlefs in morals 

the firft inference is good even though we grant that our 
only poflible mode of knowing of the exiftence of an accufer c 
is by eftablifhing that francis was junius it is even good againft 
one who fhould aftert that the accufer c is a contradiftion in 
terms in every actual and imaginable cafe except that of junius 

in the fecond cafe we put it that the man homer if he ever 
exifted fome critics having contended for the contrary was a 
perfefl poet if ever there were one there may never have 
been one and then homer exiftent or nonexiftent was not a 
perfeft poet there is no condition here which being fulfilled 
is held to amount to an aftertion that the middle term muft have 
exifted but the condition of the exiftence of the middle term is 
independent accordingly the fecond inference is not good it 
ihould be homer if c was a perfeft poet if ever there were 
one that is or elfe there never was a perfefl poet

 on the syllogifm 

thefe points refer to the matter of a fyllogifm and not to the 
form or rather perhaps hold a kind of intermediate relation 

there is another procefs which is often neceflary in the 
formation of the premifes of a fyllogifm involving a transforma 
tion which is neither done by fyllogifm nor immediately reducible 
to it it is the fubftitution in a compound phrafe of the name 
of the genus for that of the fpecies when the ufe of the name 
is particular for example man is animal therefore the head 
of a man is the head of an animal is inference but not fyllo 
gifm and it is not mere fubftitution of identity as would be the 
head of a man is the head of z rational animal but a fubftitution 
of a larger term in a particular fenfe 

perhaps fome readers may think they can reduce the above to 
a fyllogifm if man and head were connefted in a manner which 
could be made fubjeft and predicate fomething of the fort might 
be done but in appearance only for example every man is 
an animal therefore he who kills a man kills an animal it 
may be faid that this is equivalent to a ftatemcnt that in every 
man is an animal fome one kills a man therefore fome one 
kills an animal the firft premife and the fecond premife condi 
tionalfyj involve the conclufion as conditionally this i admit 
but the laft is not a fyllogifm and involves the very difficulty in 
queftion every man is an animal fome one is the killer of 
a man here is no middle term to bring the firft premiie 
into every killer of a man is the killer of an animal is juft the 
thing wanted by the principles of chapter iii undoubtedly 
the copula is might in certain inferences be combined with the 
copula killsj or with any verb but fo fimple a cafe as the pre 
ceding is not the whole difficulty if any one fliould think he 
can fyuogize as to the inftances i have yet given let him try the 
following certain men upon the report of certain other men 
to a third fet of men j put a fourth fet of men at variance with a 
fifth fet of men now every man is an animal and therefore 
 certain animals upon the report of certain other animals j c 
let the firft defcription be turned into the fecond by any num 
ber of fyuogifms and by help of every man is an animal 

the truth is that in the formation of premifes as well as in 
their ufe there is a poftulate which is conftantly applied and there 
fore of courfe conftantly demanded and it fliould be demanded 
openly it contains the dictum de omni et nullo fee the next chap 



on the syllogifm 

ter and it is as follows for every term ufed univerfally lefi 
may be iiibftituted and for every term ufed particularly more 
the fpecies may take the place of the genus when all the genus 
is fpoken of the genus may take the place of the fpecies when 
fome of the fpecies is mentioned or the genus ufed particularly 
may take the place of the fpecies ufed univerfally not only in 
fyllogifms but in all the ramifications of the defcription of a com 
plex term thus for men who are not europeans maybe 
fubftituted animals who are not englifli if this poftulate be 
applied to the unftrengthened forms of the ariftotelian syllogifm 
page it will be feen that all which contain a are immediate 
applications of it and all the others eaiily derived 

i now pafe to the confideration of the invention of names and 
of the diftinftions which are made to exift for the want of it 

any one may invent a name that is may choofe a found or 
fymbol which is to apply to any clafe of ideas or of objefts the 
clafs fhould no doubt be well defined but fmall caution is here 
neceffary for invented words are generally muqh more definite 
than thofe which have undergone public uge they come from 
the coiners hand as harp at the edge as a new halfpenny and in 
procefs of time we look in vain for any edge at all the right 
of invention being unlimited and the a£tual flock having been 
got together without any uniform rule of formation there can 
be no reafon why we jhould admit any dtjiinslion which can he ah 
rogated by the invention of a name fo far as inference is con 
cerned i do not difpute that the modes of fupplying the want 
of names may be of importance in many points of view what 
i deny is that they create any peculiar modes of inference 

the invention of names mufl either be by aftually pointing 
out objefts named or by defcription in terms of other names 
with the former mode of invention as let this that c fliow 
ing them be called x we can have nothing to do as to the 
latter we may make a fymbolic defcription of the procefs by join 
ing together the names to be ufed with a fymbol indicative of 
the mode of ufing them in extenfion of the fyflem in page io 
thus p q r being certain names if we wifh to give a name 
to everything which is all three we may join them thus pqr 
if we wifh to give a name to every thing which is either of the 
three one or more of them we may write pqr if we want 
to fignify any thing that is either both p and q or r we have 



 on the syllogifm 

pqr the contrary of pqr is pqr that of pqr is pqr 
that of pqr is pqr in contraries conjunftion and disjunc 
tion change places this notation would enable us to exprefe 
any complication of the preceding conditions thus to name that 
which is one and one only of the three we have pqr qrp 
rpq for that which is two and two only pqr qrp rpq 
thus xy includes the inftances common to x and y but 
xy mcludes all x and all y accordingly xy is a wider term 
than x y except when x and y are identical as in page io 
xy the term fuppofed to exift is xy the propofition of chapter 
iv if we wifh to diftinguifli we may make xy the term and 
x y the propofition the hyphen having its common grammatical 
ufe thus xy pq tells us the fame as x ypq both mean 
ing for inference j no more than that there exift objefts or ideas 
to which the four names are applicable but the firft tells it 
thus fome xys are pqs and the fecond thus fome things are 
xs ys and pqs 

with refpeft to this and other cafes of notation repulfive 
as they may appear the reader who refiifes them is in one of two 
circumftances either he wants to give his aftent or difient to 
what is faid of the form by means of the matter which is jsafing 
the difficulty by avoiding it and ftepping out of logic or elfe he 
defires to have it in a fhape in which he may get that moft futile 
of all acquifitions called a general idea which is truly to ufe 
the contrary adjeftive term as colloquially nothing particular a 
whole without parts 

if the difficulty of abftradl aflertion be to be got over the 
eafieft way is by firft conquering that of abftraft expreion to 
the extent of becoming able to make a little ufe of it 

suppofe we afk for the alternative of the following fuppofition 
 both x and either p or q and one of the two r or s this 
is no impoffible complication for inftance he was rich and 
if not abfolutely mad was weaknefs itfelf fubjefted either to bad 
advice or to moft unfavourable circumftances the reprefen 
tation of the complex term is x p qrs of the contrary 

• je vous avoue dit que jai cm en devincr quclquc chofe ct que 
je nai pas entendu le refte labbe de a ce difcours fit reflexion que 
cetait ainfi que luimeme avait toujours lu ct que la plupart dcs hommes 
ne lifaient guerc autremcnt 



on the syllogiffh 

x pqrs or xpqprs if not the above he was either not rich 
or both not mad and not very weak or neither mad nor badly 
advifed nor unfavourably circumftanced 

when a name thus formed whether conjunftively or disjunc 
tively enters a imple inference it gives rife to what have been 
called the copulative fyuogifm the disjunsfive fyllogifm and the 
dilemma the two laft are not well diftinguifhed by their defi 
nitions as given the disjunctive fyllogifm feems to be that in 
which names are confidered disjundlively the dilemma that in 
which propojitions are fb ufed but a propofition entering as part 
of a propofition enters merely as a name the predicates being 
ufually only true ox falfe or fome equivalent terms a propofi 
tion may only enter for its matter or it may enter in fuch a way 
that its truth is the matter in this lafl cafe it is only as a name 
that it is the fubjeft of inference thus it is true that he was 
fired at is the affertion that he was fired at is a true aftertion 
i believe the befl way would be to apply the term disjunsfive 
argument fo as to include the dilemma marking by the latter 
word as a term rather of rhetoric than of logic every argument 
in which the disjun£ive propofition is meant to be a difficulty 
for the opponent on every cafe or horn of it 

whatever has right to the name p and alfo to the name q 
has right to the compound name pq this is an abfolute 
identity for by the name pq we fignify nothing but what has 
right to both names according xp xqxpqis not a 
fyllogifm nor even an inference but only the affertion of our 
right to ufe at our pleafure either one of two ways of faying the 
fame thing inflead of the other but can we not effeft the re 
du£ion fyllogiflically let y be identical with pq we have 
then pq y and ypq and alfo yp and yq add to thefe 
xp and xq and we have all the propofitions afferted but 
we cannot deduce from them alone xy the refult wanted by 
any fyuogiflic combination of the fix nor mufl it be thought 
furprifing that we cannot by a train of argument arrive at de 
monftration of it being allowable to give to anything which has 
right to two names a third name invented exprefsly to fignify 
that which has fuch right we might as well attempt to fyllo 
gize into the refult that a perfon who fells the meat he has killed 
is a butcher 



 on the syllogijm 

i lay ftrefs upon this to an extent which may for a moment 
appear like diligently grinding nothing in a mill which might be 
better employed for two reafons firft the young mathema 
tician is very apt to try in algebra to make one principle deduce 
another by mere force of fymbols and the above attempt may 
how him what he is liable to secondly i am inclined to fup 
pofe that the diftinftion drawn between the clafles of fyllogifms 
to which i prefently come and the ordinary categorical ones is 
due to what muft be defcribed in my language as a want of per 
ception of the abfolute lefs than inferential fo to peak identity 
ofxp xqand xpq but all other proportions of the 
kind however fimple may be made dedu£ions for inftance 
 if x be both p and q and if p be r and qbe s then x is 
both cland s is thus deduced xp prxr and xct 
 qsxs and xr xs is xrs even pr qr 
pqr is deducible being pr qrrprqrpq 
pqr thus it is feen that as foon as the conjunsfive poftu 
late is laid down the identity of the correfponding disjun£ive 
poftulate with it may be fhown next if x muft be either p 
or q or xpq and if p be always r and qbe always s then 
xrs may be deduced from the preceding 

firft that xp and yclgive xypclcan be deduced evi 
dent as it may be it is a fucceffion of applications x yx 
xp gives xypand xyy yclgives xyqand xyp 
 xyctis xypclby the poftulate next xpct is pqx 
and pr is rp and qs is sq whence as juft proved rspq 
now rspqhpqxrsx which is xrs it will be a good 
exercife for the reader to tranflate this proof into ordinary lan 
guage 

i may now proceed to extend this idea and notation relative 
to propofitions of complex terms the complexity conftfts in 
the terms being conjundlively or disjunctively formed from other 
terms as in pq that to which both the names p and belong 
conjunilively and as in pqthat to which one or both of 
the names p and belong disjunftively the contrary of pq 
is pq that of p is pq not both is either not one or not the 
other or not either not either p nor which we might denote 
by pqor •pq is logically not p and not qj or pq and 
this is then the contrary of pq 



on the syllogifm 

the disjunelive name is of two very different charadlers ac 
cording as it appears in the univerfal or particular form fo very 
different that it has really different names in the two cafes 
copulative and disjunsfive this diflinion i here throw away 
oppofing disjunsfive having one or more of the names to 
conjunsfive having all the names the disjunftive particle or 
has the fame meaning with the diflributive copulative and when 
ufed in a univerfal thus every thing which is p or q is 
r or s means every p and every q is r r s but p is 
always both p and qin one accordingly 



conjunftive 
disjunftive 



pqr ufes and colleftively 

pr in a univerfal ufes and diflributively 
pqr in a particular ufes or disjunftively in 
the common fenfe of that word 



either p or qis true is an ambiguous phrafe which is 
pqt or tpq according to the context 

the manner in which the component of a name enters whe 
ther conjundlivcly or disjunftively is to pafs as it were for a part 
of the quality of the name itfelf thus the contrary of p con 
jundlive as indicated by the abfence of the comma is p dis 
jundlive as indicated by the comma to tefl this aftertion about 
the mode of making contraries let us afk what is that of one 
only of the two p or qj we know it of courfe to be both or 
neither the name propofed is pq qp and its contrary is 
pqqp that is one of the two pq and one of the two qp 
it is then either pq pp qq or pq the fecond and third can 
not exifl therefore it is pq pq as already feen i need hardly 
have remarked that pqrs is pr ps qr qs 

obfcrve that though xpq gives xp and that xpq gives 
xp we may not fay that xyp gives xp nor that xpct 
gives xp but any disjunftive element may be rejefted from 
a univerfal term and any conjunftive element from a par 
ticular one thus pqr gives pcl and pqr gives pr 
alfo pqr gives pciand pqrs gives pr all thefe rules 
are really one namely that pq is of the fame extent at leafl as 
pqr this will appear from our rules of tranfpofition prefently 
given 



i on the syllogtfm 

let change from one member of the propofition to the other 
be called tranfpojition i proceed to inquire how many tranfpo 
fitions the various forms will bear and what they are it will 
however be neceffary to complete our forms by the recognition as 
a propofition of the fimple affertion of exiftence or nonexiftence 
by xu we mean that there are in the univerfe things to which 
the name x applies and we peak only of fuch things under the 
name accordingly xu and xu do not differ in meaning 
by u the contrary of u we can only denote nonexiftence 
thus xu or xu throws the name x out of confideration 
thus yxuxy yx yxu c to fignify for in 
ftance that x and y are complements contraries or fubcon 
traries page we have uxy which our rules will tranf 
pofe into xyu or xy 

having to confider fubjeft and predicate conjunftive and dif 
junftive affirmative and negative univerfal and particular we 
muft think of fixteen different forms thus the four forms of 
the univerfal affirmative are 

xypq xypcb xypq xypcl 

it will be beft here to negleft the contranominal converfes of 
a and o equally with the fimple converfes of e and i thus 
xypq may be read as identical with pqxy there is alfo 
one obvious tranfpofition which we muft not merely negleft but 
throw out fince it does not give a refult identical with its prede 
ceftor i mean the tranfpofition of mpqinto mpq the 
fecond follows from the firft but not the firft fromi the fecond 
alfo the correfponding change of mpqinto mpq for the 
fame reafon 

this being premifed the following are the rules — 

direff tranfpofition is the change from one member to the 
other without alteration of name or junftion contrary with 
alteration of both 

the convertibles ei allow direft tranfpofition of conjundlive 
elements either way from fubjeft to predicate or from predicate 
to fubjeft and thefe are the only direft tranfpofitions thus 
xyzxyz and xyzxyz 

the inconvertibles a allow contrary tranfpofition of con 
junflive elements from fubjecl to predicate and of disjunliv 



on the syllogifm 



 



elements from predicate to fubjeft beft remembered by allow 
ing sp to ftand for conjunsfive and ps for disjunsfive and thefe 
are the only contrary tranfpofitions thus xymxmy 
and mxymyx 

an element that can be rejefted cannot be tranfpofed and 
vice verfd thus xym gives xm and y cannot be tranf 
pofed

if for we write in the left hand divifions and erafe the 
and ufe the hyphens of page on the right we have the tranf 
pofitions of o and i and if we write p and q for p and qon 
the left and change the form xy into xy we thereby change 
the forms of a into thofe of e if more than two element 
were ufed the tranfpofitions would now be perfeftly eafy 

it appears that there are no lefs than fixteen a forms into 



 on the syllogifm 

which xypqmajr be varied the reafon is that both fubjeft 
and predicate are tranfpofibly conftrufted but xypq hows 
only a tranfpofible fubjeft j xypq only a tranfpofible predi 
cate and thefe have only four forms each laftly xypq 
having neither tranfpofible has only two forms by tranfpofi 
bly conftrufted i mean capable of having the elements feparated 
by tranfpofition the whole term is always tranfpofible that is 
the complete fubjeft or the complete predicate may be looked 
on as conjunftive or disjundlive at pleafure thus in xy if 
we confider this as xuyu we may make this yuxu or yx 
so that the ordinary contranominal converfion may be confidered 
as a cafe of the more general rule juft as in arithmetic a num 
ber may be made to obey the laws of i as or of ab 

as i x 

syllogifms of complex terms might be widely varied even if w 
chofe to confider only each firft cafe of the preceding table as 
fundamental thus 

xypclvwpqxyvw aiat 

would give fixtyfour varieties of premifes i now proceed to 
fhow that the ordinary disjunctive and dilemmatic forms are 
really common fyllogifms with complex terms reducible to ordi 
nary fyllogifms by invention of names 

example i every s is either p q r no p is s no qis 
s therefore every s is r let s reprefent the true propofi 
tion fingular and let p q r be names of propofitions and 
this then reprefents a very common form which would be ex 
preflted thus either a is b or c is d or e is f j but a is not 
b c is not d therefore e is f i fay that where the necef 
fary names exift the final ftep of this could not be diftinguifhed 
from a common fyuogifm which accordingly it becomes by in 
vention of names 

we have spqr whence spqr but sp and sqor sp 
and sq give spq with which ss combined gives spqs and 
spqs pqsrsr let m be the name of what is s and not p 
and not q and the thing required is done here then is a fyuogifm 
of the ordinary kind to one premife of which we are led by a 
ufe of the conjunsfive pojlulate page the neceffity for which 
is the diftinction between the clafs we are confidering and others 
it happens here that two of the terms of our final fyuogifm are 



on the syllogifm 

identical for spq is of no greater extent than s but the ufe 
made of ss is perfesly legitimate 

exampu if a be b e is f and if c be d e is f but 
either a is b or c is d therefore e is f this can be re 
duced to 

pr qr spqsr 

which is immediately made a common fyllogifm by changing 
prqrintopqr 

example from p follows q and from r follows s j but 
qand s cannot both be true therefore p and r cannot both 
be true this may be reduced to 

pclrs tqstpr 
orprqs tqstpr 

example every x is either p q or r but every p is 
m every q is m every r is m therefore every x is m 
this is a common form of the dilemma it is obvioufly reduci 
ble to pqrmxpqrxm 

example every x is either p or q and every q is x 
this is wholly inconclufive and leads to an identical refiilt as 
follows xpq gives xpq which with qx gives xpx 
a neceflary proportion 

example if we throw xr into the form xrr we have 
xrr or every x which is not r is r a con tradition in 
terms but it evidently implies that there can be no xs which 
are not rs j and thus alfo we return to xr take every x 
is either p q or r every p is m every q is m and every 
m is r here xpqrxrpq which with pqm gives 
xrm which with mr gives xrr or xr 

example every x is either p or q and onlv one this 
gives two propofitions xpq xpq now xxpxq is 
identical with xpq and this may be looked on as an extreme 
cafe of 

xpq xyxpyqy 
but xpq gives xpq and xqp from which we can obtain 

xxpxq xpq xqpxpq 

hence xpqxpqxpqpq 

xpppqqpqqxpqqp 
fince pp and qq are fubjeil to xpp and xqq all this being 



 on the syllogijtn 

worked out in fyllogiftic detail hows us that the tranfidon from 
 every x is p or q and no x is both to every xis either 
p and not q or q and not p is capable of being made fyuo 
giftically the ihident of logic may thus acquire the idea 
which fo foon becomes familiar to the ftudent of mathematics 
of perfectly felfevident propofitions which are deducible from 
one another as diftinguiflied from thofe which are not 

example every x is one only of the two p or q 
every y is both p and q except when p is m and then it is 
neither therefore no x is y here is a cafe in which it is the 
fail of the exception and not its nature which determines the 
inference m may be anything this ought to appear in our 
reduftion and it does appear in this way from xpq it is 
obvious that xpqrs and fyllogiftically demonftrable from 
xpq and xrsx now in the fecond premife we have 

ypqmpqm or pqmpqmy 
or pqpqpmqmpmqmy 

from which by rejeftion follows pqpqy and the firft pre 
mife is xpqqp whence xy or xy 

it is not neceflary to multiply examples i will conclude this 
part of the fubjeft by pointing out that the ordinary propofitions 
xy c are with reference to their inftances disjun£lively 
compofed the difference between the univerfal and particular 
lying in the latter being indefinite in the number of its inftances 
thus if there be three xs and four ys the four propofitions 
are applying the name to each inftance as feen written at length in 
xxxyyyy xxxyyyy xxxyyyy 
and xxxyyyy 

the propofition in page is a cafe of the preceding method 
i leave the reader to how it and alfb that the hypothefis is 
lightly overftated 

i now come to the forites the heap or chain of fyllogiins in 
which the conclufion of the firft is a premife of the fecond and 
b on take a fet of terms p q r s c and let the order 
of reference be pq qr rs c then aiaiaiai c is a

pqqrrsstpt 



on the syllogijtn 

the firft two links give pr which with the third gives psy 
which with the fourth gives pt thus we have link y inter 
mediate conclujions and tl final conclufion 

a great number of different forites may be formed under the 
following conditions 

the firft particular propofition which occurs be it link or 
conclufion prevents any future link from being particular for 
all the conclufions thence become particular 

examine the cafes of fyuogifm which proceed by the firft 
rule of accentuation page that is which have beginning and 
ending both univerial or both particular thefe only can occur 
in a forites except at the end or in the place where a particular 
propofition firft enters it will be found that the conclufion 
when the argument goes on muft come after fomething con 
ne£led with that which comes after it by the firft rule of ac 
centuation except at the place where a particular conclufion 
comes in for the firft time for inftance ee gives ai which 
ftill keeping conclufions univerfal muft be followed by ai or ei 
which follow el hj the firft rule again take oie which gives 
ii this muft be followed either by ai or ei which follow e by 
the feme rule and fo on accordingly 

any chain of univerials in which affirmation is followed by a 
like prepofition and negation by a different one as aiaieia 
eaieie c may be part of the chain of a forites and the 
chain muft be either of this kind wholly or once only broken in 
one of two ways either by the direft entrance of a particular 
propofition or by a breach of the rule in a chain of this kind 
unbroken the conclufions are affirmative or negative according 
as an even or odd number of negatives goes to the formation of 
them all the conclufions have the fame accent as the firft link 

let a particular premife be introduced as in aieiet c 
the accent of the particular introduced muft b the fame as 
or contrary to that of the firft link according as the preceding 
number of negatives is odd or even for the accent of the firft 
link remains as long as the conclufion is univerfal and a fyllo 
gifm with the fecond premife particular follows the fecond 
rule thus inferting the intermediate conclufions the above is 
aieieiearr and after v muft come a or f fo 
that the firft rule ftill continues but the accent of the conclu 
fions changes 



 on the sylhgifm 

now let the rule of accentuation be broken the accent of 
the conclufton ftill requires the firft rule to be refumed thus 
eierule unbroken gives ai and eiei rule broken gives t 
and ai requires ai or e to follow e while v requires a or 
e to follow el this one breach of rule only changes the con 
clufion from univerial to particular the accent of the condu 
fion changes as before 

the links of a forites then are either a chain of univerfids 
following the firft rule of accentuation or fuch a chain with one 
breach of the rule or fuch a chain with one particular inferted 
of the fame or contrary accent to the firft link according as the 
preceding negatives are odd or even and made the commence 
ment of the refumption of the rule if broken in all the cafes 
the conclufion is affirmative or negative according as the preced 
ing negatives are even or odd in number the unbroken chain 
has a univerfal conclufion with the accent of the firft link and 
the broken one a particular with the contrary accent

chapter vii 

on the artftotelian syllogijm 

from the time of ariftotle until now the formal inference 
has been a matter of ftudy in the writings of the great 
philofbpher and in a fbmewhat fcattered manner are found the 
materials out of which was conftrufted the fyftem of fyllogifm 
now and always prevalent and two diftinft principles of exclu 
fion appear to be a£ted on perhaps it would be more corre£fc 
to fay that the followers colleded two diftin£l principles of ex 
clufion from the writings of the mailer by help of the aftumption 
that everything not ufed by the teacher was forbidden to the 
learner i cannot find that ariftotle either limits his reader in 
this manner or that he anywhere implies that he has exhaufted 
all poffible modes of fyuogizing but whether thefe exclufions 
are to be attributed to the followers alone or whether thofe who 
have more knowledge of his writings than myfelf can fix them 
upon the leader this much is certain that they were adopted 
and have in all time didlated the limits of the fyllogifm of all 
men ariftotle is the one of whom his followers have worfliipped 
his defefts as well as his excellencies which is what he himfelf 
never did to any man living or dead indeed he has been accufed 
of the contrary fault 

the firft of thefe exclufions is connefted with the celebrated 
disium de omni et nullo namely that what is diftributively afiirmed 
or denied of all is diftributively afiirmed or denied of every fome 
which that all contains it is there faid that in every fyllogifm 
the middle term muft be univerfal in one of the premifes in order 
that we may be fure that the affirmation or denial in the other 
premife may be made of bme or all of the things about which 
affirmation or denial has been made in the firft this law as 
we fhatl fee is only a particular cafe of the truth it is enough 
that the two premifes together affirm or deny of more than all 
the inftances of the middle term if there be a hundred boxes 
into which a hundred and one articles of two different kinds are 



 on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

to be put not more than one of each kind into any one box 
feme one box if not more will have two articles one of each 
kind put into it the common do£rine has it that an article 
of one particular kind muft be put into every box and then bme 
one or more of another kind into one or more of the boxes be 
fore it may be affirmed that one or more of different kinds are 
found together this exclufion is a iimple miftake the mere 
fubftitution of the aflertion that none but a certain law of infe 
rence can exift for the determination that no other jhall exift 
any one is at liberty to limit the inferences he will ufe in any 
manner he pleafes but he may err if he declare his own arbi 
trary boundary to be a natural limit impofed by the laws of 
thought 

the other exclufion may involve on the ame terms an error 
of the fame kind or may equally be the expreffion of arbitrary 
will but there is what is more reafonably matter of opinion about 
it ariftotle will have no contrary terms notman he ays is not 
the name of anything he afterwards calls it an indefinite or 
aoriji name becaufe as he aflerts it is both the name of exifting 
and nonexifting things if he had here made the diftinion 
between ideal and objeftive he would have feen that man and 
nouman equally belong to both objectively exifting and non 
exifting things man for example belongs as a name to achilles 
and the feven champions of chriftendom whether they ever ex 
ifted in objeftive reality or not and notman belongs in either 
cafe to their horfes i think however that the exclufion was 
probably diftated by the want of a definite notion of the extent 
of the field of argument which i have called the univerfe of the 
propofitions adopt fuch a definite notion and as fuieciently 
hown there is no more reafon to attach the mere idea of ne 
gation to the contrary than to the direft term 

the exclufion of contraries throws out the propofitions e 
and r or xy and xy which cannot be exprefled without either 
contraries as in xyxyyx and xyxyyx or refe 
rence to things not named by x and y as in every thing is 
either x or y and some things are neither xs nor ys the 
moft natural readings of no notxs are notys and some not 
xs are notys there remain then fix modes of connexion of 
x and y namely xy and yx xy and yx and xy 



on the ariftotelian syllogifm 

yx and xy yx thefe fix are made eight for in the 
common fyftem xy and yx are confidered as diftindl in form 
and alfo xy and yx but thefe eight are only treated as 
four for reference to order is not made in the fimple propofi 
tion thus xy and yx are both denoted by a xy and 
yx by i xy and yx by e and xy and yx by o but 
the ftandard of order which is negle£led as to the propofition by 
itfelf is adopted in the fyuogifm in the following manner 

the predicate of the conclufion is called the major term and 
the fubje of the conclufion the minor term this language is 
fafhioned upon the idea of an affirmative propofition in which 
major and minor have reference to magnitude in every x is z 
z is a name which entirely contains x and is therefore at leaji 
as great as x greater than or equal to x here is before it 
was introduced into mathematics the idea now fo familiar to the 
mathematician of allowing his language to include the extreme 
limit of its meaning when the fame terms are applied to 
negative propofitions the notion of magnitudinal inclufion is 
loft and major and minor being ftill retained muft be pre 
fiimed to refer to real or fuppofed importance the premifes 
are called major and minor according as they contain the major 
or minor term of the conclufion and the major premife is always 
written firft accordingly z and x being the major and minor 
terms there are four poffible arrangements which are called the 
four figures ariftotle gives three and tradition has it that 
galen fupplied the fourth in number and order 

i yz zy yz zy 
xy xy yx yx 



xz xz xz xz 

to me the moft fimple arrangement is that which takes up 
what was left off with as in the fourth figure and x is in y 
y is in z therefore x is in z is more natural than y is in z 
x is in y therefore x is in z 

it is now plain that whenever one only of the three propofi 
tions is convertible there are two diftinft ways in which the 
fyuogifm may be written when two only four and when all 
three if there were fuch a thing eight 



 on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

the iyftem rejefts all conclufions which may be made 
ftronger thus when x z follows it does not allow x z to 
make a diftinft form but when xz is the conclufion it does 
not rejeft zx for not confidering zx as identical with xz it 
does not confider xz as a ftrengthened form of zx but it 
does not rejedl iyllogifms in which as ftrong a concluiion can be 
deduced from a weaker premife accordingly we muft fearch 
for ariftotelian forms among the ftrengthened fyllogifms of 
chapter v as well as among the fundamental ones now 
taking all the forms which how neither e or t let us write 
down the fymbols of them and the number of cafes we may 
expeft from each moreover ince transformation of order 
makes no difference here i put the fyllogifms together as in

the words which repfefent the different moods as they are 
called are ufually colleded under their figures in the following 
lines 

barbara celarent darii ferioque prioris 
cefare cameftres feftino baroko fecundae 
tertia darapti difainis datiii felapton 
bokardo ferifon habet qarta infuper addit 
bramantip camenes dimaris fefapo frefifon 

the yowck of the different words give the iymbol of the 
fyllogifm thus a a a are ktn in barbara the confonants 
in the firfl figure have no fpecial meaning but in the other 
figures every confbnant except t and n which are only eu 
phonic has its meaning as follows — every mood of every figure 
can with two exceptions in one way or another be reduced to 
a mood of the firft figure and the letters fhow the way of doing 
it the initial tells to which mood the reduftion brings us 
thus cefare is reduced to celarent and alfo cameflres feflino 
is reduced to ferio and fo on the two exceptions are denoted 
by the letter k as in baroko and bokardo we hall prefently 
notice them further and s means that the preceding premife is to 
be fimply converted p that what was called converfion per acci 



 on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

dens is to be made zx for xz or xz for zx accordingly 
p only occurs in the weakened or ftrengthened fyllogifms m 
means that the premifes are to be tranfpofed thus the meaning of 
the word difamis is nothing lefs than what follows there is a 
fyuogifm in which the middle term is the fubje£l of both pre 
mifes andhen reduced to the firft figure it becomes darii 
the major premife which muft be converted in reduftion is a 
particular affirmative the minor premife which muft become 
the major one in reduction is a univerial affirmative and the 
conclufion which muft be converted in reduftion is a particular 
affirmative thus 

yz yx xz difamis 
becomes yx zy zx darii 

the moods baroko and bokardo do not admit of reduftion to 
the firft figure by any fair ufe of the phrafe but the logicians 
were determined they fhould do fo and they accordingly hit 
upon the following plan which they called reduftion per impofji 
bile aoo and oao being the opponent forms pages 
and of aaa the two moods in queftion were connefted 
with barbara whence their letter b by fliowing that the latter 
would make the denial of their conclufions force one premife to 
contradidt the other thus baroko or if zy and x y then 
x z was proved in the firft figure as follows if under thefe 
premifes xz be not true then xz is true j but zy is true 
and zy xz by barbara gives xy but xy there 
fore i baroko be not a legitimate form xy and xy are both 
true at once which is abfurd had contraries been ufed 
zy x yx z would have been thrown into the firft figure 
as yz xyxz xrv or yz xyxz ferio and 
yz yxxz bokardo is feen reduced to the firft figure 
in yx zyzxzr 

ariftotle did not ufe the fourth figure confidering it as is 
faid to be only an inverfion of the firft the introduftion of it 
among the figures is attributed to galen and it does not often 
appear in ordinary works of logic before the beginning of the laft 
century if the order of the premifes be inverted fo as to make 
the firft figure appear the major and minor terms will appear 
wrongly placed in the conclufion the words ufed for dxefc 



on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

indirea moods of the firft figure were ufually the fifth and fol 
lowing ones in 

barbara celarent darii ferto baralip 
celantes dabitis fapefmo frifefomrw 

the final fyllables in italics being only euphonic frifefmoorum 
would have been more correal some ufed the words farefmo 
and firefmo 

in calling the jtnoods of the fourth figure by the name of in 
direft moods of the firft figure notice was taken of the circum 
ftance that a tranfpofition of the premifes would give the ar 
rangement of the firft figure in every thing but the proper 
arrangement of major and minor terms which is inverted a 
little confideration will fhow the reader that the earlier ariftote 
lians were wifer than the later ones in this matter confider the 
fourth and firft figures as coincident and the arbitrary notion of 
arrangement by major and minor vanifhes it was not till this 
mere matter of difcipline was mde an article of faith that the 
fourth figure hadany ground of feceffion from the firft 

it might feem as if the union of the firft and fourth figures 
would demand that of the fecond and third the firft pair con 
taining all the moods in which the middle term occupies different 
places in the two premifes the fecond pair thofe in which it has 
the fame place in both if this were done each of the two main 
fubdivifions muft be itfelf fubdivided into two and this would 
perhaps have been the more ikilful mode of divifion 

the diftinftion of figures has been condemned by many and 
particularly by kant whether attacked or defended it is eften 
tial that the true grounds of the fide taken fhould be more ex 
plicitly ftated than is often done the root of the diftinftion of 
figure is undoubtedly the diftinftion between the two forms xy 
and yx x y and y x it would be equally abfurd either to 
deny the identity of xy and yx confidered as material of 
inference or to deny their difference in many other points of 
view in this work i am concerned only with what can be 
inferred and to what extent of quantity and accordingly the dif 
tinftion is to me immaterial but if i had not merely to ftudy 
the way of ufing premifes but alfo that of arriving at them it 
might very well happen that the afpe£ls under which the fame 



 the arijiotelian syllogifm 

inference is feen in different figures would give it very different 
fliades of charafter a fimple inftance will fliow that though 
the comparifon and its extent are all that can be attended to in 
forming the conclufion thefe points of meaning are not the only 
ones a perfon who wiflied to conteft the old ufe of the word 
greerty as applied to unripe fruit would fay that fome green 
fruits are ripe if he wanted fpecially to fliow the mifapplication 
of the word but if he rather wanted to fliow the badneis of 
the method of denying ripenefs he would fay fome ripe fruits 
are green the propofitions are endlefs in which x and y 
being the terms it is at one time x which is brought to y for 
comparifon and at another y to x the fubjeft of a propofi 
tion is always the objeft of examination whether the form be 
xy xy xy or xy we examine and report upon the xs 
if we arrange the four figures feparately we ftiall better fee 
their feveral peculiarities 

firjl figure 



barbara yz xyxz

what is here declared is in every cafe the dihun de omni et 
nullo in its fimpleft form in a manner which juftifies the prefe 
rence given to this figure the middle term being completely 
contained in or completely excluded from the major term fuch 
incluficmi or exclufion then follows of all fuch part of the minor 
term as is declared in the fecond premife to be in the middle 
term the inference then is in this fentence what is true of 
the whole middle term is true of its part and it is obvious 
that in this figure the major premife muft be univerfal the minor 
premife affirmative the four forms are all found among the 
conclufions i think that the inverfion of the premifes which 
the fyftem of chapter v employs will be found to give the forms 
which are moft eafily tranflated into language independent of the 
middle term the fentence all or fome of the xs are what 
muft be zs therefore all or fome of the xs are zs includes 
barbara and darii and all or fome of the xs are what can 
not be zs and therefore cannot be zs contains celarent and 
ferio

in this figure in which only negatives can be proved the ap 
pearance of the diftum is not fo direft the terms of the 
conclufion are both objefts of examination and one is wholly 
included and the whole or part of the other excluded celare 
cameftres and baroko or one is wholly excluded and the whole 
or part of the other included ceiare cameftres and feftino 
or rather to juftify the diftin£lion we fhould fay that the whole

 excluded

mcluded ° ceiare 

is therefore excluded from the major or elfe the whole of the

maior is j j and part of the minor which gives 
• excluded included ° 

p n in which that part of the minor is excluded from the 

major and it is evident enough why the premifes muft be of 
different figns 

in the firft figure though all the forms be eflentially one 
page the reduftion of either to the form barbara requires 
either the explicit ufe of contraries or invention of a name fub 
identical to x accordingly no mood of that figure is reducible 
to any other by the ufually admitted reductions but this cannot 
be faid of any of the other figures in the one before us cefare 
and cameftres are identical even without changing the figure 
that which is cefare when x is major and z minor is camef 
tres when x is minor and z major in the firft figure the 
feme attempt made on celarent or darii removes them into

with one particular derived from each by a legitimate weakening of

ftance is the quantity of the middle term weakened and all 
the fyuogifms in thefe two figures are fundamental page 
in the cafe now before us both the leading fyuegifms are not 
fundamental but ftrengthened and capable of being weakened in 
two different ways the middle term is here examined in both 
premifes if it be wholly included in or excluded from one of 
the concluding terms and wholly or partly included in or ex 
cluded from the other but not fo that there fliall be exclu 
fion from both we have it that the whole or part mentioned in 
one cafe is included in or excluded from that which the whole 
is included in or excluded from in the other there can be 
none but particular conclufions

we have now one univerfal fyuogifm in a form which does not 
admit of being weakened in this figure and two ftrengthened 
fyllogifms each of which has one weakened form one of them 
bramantip admitting a ftronger conclufion in another figure 
every conclufion except a appears the mode of inference of 
the three firft fyllogifms has been defcribed in the otherfigures 
in fefapo and frefifon the perfe£l exclufion of the major term 
from the middle accompanied by the total or partial inclufion of 
the middle in the minor fecures the exclufion from the major 
of as much of the minor as it has in common with the middle 
i hall now proceed to the rules ufually given and to fome 
remarks on the degree in which they apply to the more general 
fyftem in chapter v aldrich gives them as follows — 

diftribuas medium nee quartus terminus adfit 
utraque nee praemifla negans nee particularis 
seftetur partem conclufio dcteriorem j 
et non diftribuat nifi cum praemiflta negetvc 



on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

thefe rules i need hardly fay are perfeftly correft when the 
contraries of the terms are excluded and alfo all notion of quan 
tity except all or the indefinite fome taking them in the natu 
ral order which veriification has a little difturbed we have — 

 there are to be but three terms of which it is underftood 
two only appear in the conclufion the excluded or middle term 
appearing in both of the premiies this is true in my fylem 
when by terms are underftood alfo contraries of terms i fliould 
fuppofe that there can be no objeftion to the admiffion of con 
traries unlefe there be one to the conception of a contrary any 
one may with ariftotle obje£l to the word notman as not the 
name of anything on the grounds which immediately induced 
him to call it an aorift or indefinite name but it can hardly 
be affirmed that any one admitting notman as a name fliould 
thereupon refufe to recognife the identity of horfe is not man 
with horfe is notman 

 the middle term is to be dijiributed in one or the othr of 
the premifes by diftributed is here meant univerfally fpoken of 
i do not ufe this term in the prefent work becaufe i do not fee 
why in any deducible meaning of the word dijiributed it can be 
applied to univerfal as diftinguiflied from particular in ufing a 
name it feems to me that we always diftribute that is fcatter 
as it were the general name over the inftances to which it is to 
apply when i fay fome horfes are animals i diftribute certain 
horfes among the animals and when all all leaving the word 
the principle is one which clearly muft be true whenever we are 
reftricsled in quantity to all or fome indefinite and when con 
traries are not admitted in the former cafe we have in one 
form or another to make mn greater than v chapter viii 
when we cannot know what relation either morn has to j unlefs 
one of them or both be equal to r we have no alternative 
then but to require that m or n fliall be r the cafes in which 
there is apparently no dependence on v will be difcuffed in 
the next chapter 

but when contraries are introduced this rule is not univerfally 
true the exception is feen in 

aiatorxyfzyxz 

if all the xs be ys and alfo all the zs it follows that there are 
things which are neither xs nor zs namely all which are not 



 on the arijlotelian syllogifm 

ys it is here as elfewhere implied that the middle term is 
not the univerfe of the propofition 

when we come then to ufe contraries the fimple rule of the 
middle term is no longer univerfally true what other rule are 
we to put in its place we know of courfe that every fyllo 
gifm can be reduced to an ariftotelian fyuogifm and even to one 
or other of two among them aiai ai or ii aji or to the firft of 
thefe if we be at liberty to ufe invention of names page 
again each term or its contrary is mentioned univerfally in 
every propofition fo that there is certainly one way in which 
every pair of premifes may be made to exhibit a middle term 
univerfally ufed in one of them the rule to be fubftituted for 
the dtjhrihuas medium is that all pairs of uiiiverfels are con 
clufive but a univerfal and a particular require that the middle 
term hould alfo be a univerfal and a particular that is univerial 
in one and particular in the other thus in xy zy as it 
ftands the middle is particular in both tranfpofe intayxyz 
and the middle is now univerfal in both by which we fee the 
ariftotelian conclufion again in xy zy which is of the 
fame kind the tranfpofition gives yxfzy which is faulty 
becaufe though there be a particular premife there is not any 
where a particular middle term the cafes in which the middle 
is of the fame name in both places univerfal in four particular 
in four are the ftrengthened fyllogifms only there is nothing 
to be furprifed at in its thus appearing that the particularity of 
the middle term is juft as much a teft of a good fyuogifm as its 
univerfality of every name and its contrary one enters univer 
fally and one particularly in every propofition which contains 
it and the fyftem in chapter v is as much concerned with con 
trary as with direft terms it is thence vifible beforehand to the 
mathematician at leaft that any teft muft be defective unlefs 
univerfal and particular enter into it in the fame manner 

the above contains a complete canon of validity as fbon as 
the law of the three terms is underftood which is only a law of 
definition we may ftate it as follows two premifes conclude 
— when both are univerfal always when one only is univerfal 
fo often as it happens that the middle term be it y or y is once 
only univerfal when neither is univerfal never by this rule 
alone the thirtytwo condufive cafes can be diftinguifhed from 
the thirtytwo inconclufive ones 



on the ariftotelian syllogtfm 

 when both premifes are negative there is no ariftotelian 
fyuogifm in the fyftem completed by contraries there are eight 
fuch fyllogifms as many in fa£l as there are with premifes both 
affirmative but a pair of negative premifes never conclude with 
both terms of the premifes but with the contrary of one or 
both and this muft be fubftituted as a rule of conclufion for 
the one juft named 

 both premifes muft not be particular this rule which 
relates wholly to quantity muft be preferved in every fyftem 
which admits no definite ratio except that of one to one or 
all pages i cannot learn that any writer on logic 
ever propounded even the very fimple cafe of moft ys are 
xs moft ys are zs therefore fome xs are zs as a legiti 
mate inference and this though it is certain that the quanti 
tative prefix moji plurimi has before now excited difcuffion as 
to whether it belonged to a univerfal or a particular 

 by fesfetur partem conclujio detertorem it is underftood that 
the negative is called weaker or lower deterior than the affir 
mative and the particular than the univerfal and that the con 
clufion is to be as weak as negative or as particular if there be 
a premife which is negative or particular this rule muft be 
preferved when contraries are introduced fo far as relates to 
particulars but fo far as negatives are concerned the rule muft 
be that one negative premife gives a negative conclufion ind two 
an affirmative one 

 the laft line et non dijirihuat nifi cum premijfa negetvey 
fpoils the fymmetry to procure a verfe the conclufion is not 
to be negative without a negative premife that is affirmative 
premifes give an affirmative conclufion alfo no term is to be 
diftributively e univerfally taken in the conclufion unlefs it 
were fo taken in its premife a breach of this rule would be 
equivalent to drawing a conclufion about what was not or about 
mor than was introduced into the premifes 

when contraries are introduced the diftinftion between pofi 
tive and negative is made to appear what it really is one of 
language or rather one of choice of names but the diftin£lion 
of form is not abolifhed but is exadlly what it was before we 
cannot lay down any rules for the formation of the conclufion 
unlefs in our eight ftandard forms we preferve the mode of 



 on the arijiotelian syllogifm 

writing which belongs to the fundamental derivation of the 
forms page thus the order being xy a is xy and not 
yx and o is xy and not yx this method of writing 
being reftored when neceffary in pages and it follows 
immediately that the rule of accentuation in the notation gives 
the rule by which we determine whether the conclufion takes 
the terms from the premifes or prefers contraries according as 
the prepofition of the conclufion agrees with or differs from that of 
a premife fo does the conclufion take a term from that premife 
or its contrary thus aaa takes both terms from the pre 
mifes but aiat takes a contrary from the firft premife only 
this laft we fee if we write the fyuogifm as xyhyzxz 
accordingly we have — 

syllogifms taking both concluding terms diresf from the premifes 
univerfals which begin with a particulars which begin with i 
eight in number being all which ifolate no accent 

taking the firjl term only from the premife univerfals begin 
ning with e particulars beginning with o eight in number 
being all which ifolate the middle accent 

taking the fecond term only from the premife strengthened 
forms and particulars which begin with a eight in number 
being all which ifolate the firft accent 

taking neither term from the premifes strengthened forms 
and particulars which begin with e eight in number being all 
which ifolate the third accent 

this is a new mode of ftating the law of accentuation pages 
 which i have preferred to place here for fear of overload 
ing chapter v with rules i have not ftated one half of thofe 
which fuggefted themfelves this multiplicity of relations is a 
prefumption of the completenefs of the fyftem 

in the ariftotelian fyftem there is multiplication of the fame 
modes of inference under the varieties of figure in that which 
i propofe there is a reduplication of moft of the efltential cafes 
for whatever cafe is found the fame is alfo found with x and z 
interchanged and alfo the order of the premifes again whatever 
cafe is found it is found contranominally or with all the accents 
or prepofitions altered there are other ways and many of 
them in which the fyftem is only in one half a duplicate of what 
it is in the other if all thefe modes of dividing the fyftem into

two correlative parts divided it into the fame two parts there can 
be no queftion that one alone of thqfe parts fliould have been 
prefented as the objedl of confideration but this does not hap 
pen in any inftance fo that it is impoflible to difpenfe with the 
whole of the thirtytwo cafes the ariftotelian cafes do not 
form or include any half whatever of this fyftem 



chapter viii 

on the numerically definite syllogifm 

in the laft chapter i confidered no other quantity in names 
except all and fome the latter meaning one or more it 
may be all to this extent of quantity we are limited in moft 
kinds of reafoning by want of knowledge of the definite extent 
of our propofitions and the few phrafes page as moft 
 a good many c by which we endeavour to eftablifh differ 
ences of extent in ordinary converfation have been hitherto held 
inadmifsble into logic in this fcience it feems to have been 
always intended that the bafes on which its forms are conftrufted 
fliall be nothing but the fuppofition of the moft imperfeft and 
inaccurate knowledge though in geometry we are permitted 
to aflume as the objedl of reafoning the ideal ftraight line the 
 length without breadth of euclid which has no objeftive pro 
totype and though we fee the advantage of reafoning upon ideas 
and allowing the eflential inaccuracies of material application to 
produce no effe£l except in material application — yet in the con 
fideration of the pure forms of thought the learner has always 
been denied the advantage of ftudying the more perfeft fyftem of 
which his inferences are the imperfeft imitation 

the ordinary univerfal propofitions are of a certain approach 
to definite characsler both of them with refpeft to their fubjefts 
and the negative one with refpecl to its predicate alfo in x y 
for example what is known is as much known of any one x as 
of any other perfeft definitenefs would confift in a more exacl 
degree of defcription and would require a higher degree of know 
ledge but in this chapter i fpeak only of numerical definite 



 on the numerically 

nefs of the fuppofition that we know how many things we arc 
talking about we may be well content to examine what we 
fhould do if we were a ftep or two higher in the fcale of creation 
if by fo doing we can manage to add fomething to our methods 
of inference in the higheft to which we have as yet attained 

a numerically definite proportion is of this kind suppofe 
the whole number of xs and ys to be known lay there are 
 xs and ys in exiftence then an affirmative propo 
rtion of the fort in queflion is feen in xs or more are 
each of them one of ys and a negative propofition in 
 xs or more are no one of them to be found among 
 ys 

biit it mufl be particularly noticed that in fpeaking of a num 
ber of xs as xs i do not mean certain xs which can 
be diflinguifhed from all the refl fo that of any x it is poffible 
to be known whether it belong to the of the propofition or to 
the remaining this degree of definitenefs is one flep higher 
than that which i here propofe to confider and which is defcribed 
by there are xs which are contained among ys it not 
being known which xs are the xs nor which ys are the 
 ys or elfe by there are xs which are not any of them 
identical with any one of ys the precife xs and ys in 
queflion being unknown 

it cannot of courfe be difputed that if any thing fhould necef 
farily follow from any xs being found among any ys it 
will not the lefs follow from our knowing which are the xs and 
which are the ys but this lafl fuppofition only brings us to 
really univcrfal propofitions if there being xs of 
them can be fpecifically feparated from the refl fo as to be 
known the procefs of feparation is equivalent to putting them 



• thefe words or more fhow that the word definite has reference only 
to the ithwer boundary of courfe nothing can be fhown in right of 
or more perhaps except what is true in right of the it is defirable 
that as the premifes fo fhould be the conclufion of a fyllogifin this would 
not be the cafe if we ufed premifes definite both ways for example tfafie 
being ys in exiftence it will prefently appear that exasly ys are 
xs and exactly ys are zs though it enable us to fay that xs are 
zs does not allow us to fay exawy xs are zs but only xs or 
more are zs 



definite syllogifm 

under a feparate name fubidentical to x and the reft which are 
equally diftinguifhable under another name alfo fubidentical to 
x and contrary of the firft name when the univerfe is x 
whether the name be long or fliort does not matter nor 
whether it carry the feparating diftinftion in its etymology or 
not to feparate in any way inftance from inftance by lan 
guage is to name 

if then definite xs were known to be contained among 
 definite ys and if thefe xs were each named m and thofe 
ys each n and if the reft of the xs and ys were named p 
and q we fhould have the following propofitions 

mx px ny qy mn mpnq 

and all inferences moreover in each cafe we fliould have the 
total number of inftances which are contained under each name 
the numbers carrying with them evidence that every x is either 
m or p and every y either n or q subftitute mn for 
mn and we have the correfponding negative propofition 

but if unfeparated and infeparable xs be fuppofed known 
each to be among fimilarly fituated ys there is no immediate 
method of making any other propofition out of the terms x and 
y except its converfe that of thefe ys are xs and if 
the whole number of ys be known fay that there are 
xs which are not any one among — or ys this is 
then a fimple propofition which becomes of a highly complex 
charaaer when the xs and ys named in it are taken as defi 
nitely feparable from the reft i fliall call it the jimp le numerical 
propofition 

the diftinftion may be eafily illuftrated by example all 
the planets but one is a particular propofition it is fome 
planets there is no one planet of right included in it but 
 all the planets except neptune is a univerfal propofition a 
planetnotneptune is a name of mercury of venus c 
and of every planet it can be ftated whether it be in the name 
or not that which is true inferentially of all the planets but 
one left particular is true of all the planets but neptune 
but that which is true of the latter is not necefltarily true of the 
former 

taking x y z as the terms of the fyuogifm the number 



 the numerically 

of xs in exiftence u the number of ys and f the number of 
zs and y the number of inftances in the univerfe there are of 
courfe fixteen pofsble cafes of knowledge more or lefs of thefe 
primary quantities from all unknown to all known of thefe 
fixteen cafes it will be requifite to confider two only firft 
when the extent y of the middle term is known and all the 
reft unknown fecondly when all are known the algebraical 
formulae of the latter cafe will enable us to point out how the 
fuppofition of any lefe degree of knowledge would affe£t our 
power of inference 

i propofe the following notation let ix y denote either of 
the equivalent propofltions that m xs are to be found among the 
ys or that m ys are to be found among the xs let fwxy 
denote either of the equivalent propofltions that there are m xs 
which are not any one among n ys or n ys which are not any 
one among m xs 

the fymbol lox is the algebraical fymbol for ten equal xs 
added together x being a magnitude it is then a colle£five 
fymbol in this work x being a name it implies every one 
out of ten inftances of that name diftributively but not collec 
tively this diftinftion is very material not only in this chap 
ter but throughout every part of logic every x is y is 
diftributively true when by every x we mean each one x 
fo that the propofltion is the firft x is y and the fecond x 
is y and the third x is y c in this cafe the fubjeft is x 
and the word every belongs to the quantity of the propofltion 
but every x is y is collefively true when we do not mean 
that any one x is a y nor that any number of xs are ys but 
that all the xs make a y in this cafe the propofltion vjin 
gular there is but one inftance of the fubjeft mentioned jxhat 
fubjeft being not x but the coueftion all the xs thui the 
ten men are members of a committee is diftributive the ten 
men are a committee is coueftive 

if in fuch a propofltion as loxy we were to fuppofe the 
 xs fpecifically feparated from the reft being certain aisgnable 
ten individuals from among all the xs then lox becomes a name 
for each of the ten as much as x and may be confldered as a 
univerfal term and now loxy and ioxy mean the ame 
things

let u be known and u only of the four i u f the only 
colle£lions of premifes which it is neceflary to confider are 

wxyhyz 
ixy zjy 
ixry zxy 

without fome knowledge of the number of ys of which by 
fiippofition we have none it would be ufelefs to attempt to draw 
an inference from a pair in which y and y enter together par 
tially quantified as in ix y z ry and zy merely amounts 
to ziy 

the above three are all we need confider and even of thefe 
the third is incapable of inference fince both premifes are nega 
tive and moreover not reducible to a pofitive form by ufe of 
contraries the only way in which negative premifes really acquire 
a conclufion in chapter v 

let us firft confider the premifes wx y f yz they tell 
us that among the u ys we find m xs and n zs accordingly 
neither m nor n exceeds i if m and n together fall fhort of u 
nothing can be inferred y is extenfive enough that is there 
are inftances enough of y to hold the m xs and the n zs with 
out any coincidence of an x with a z as to other xs or zs 
we do not know whether they exift or if they exift we do not 
know that any one of them is a y but if m and n together 
exceed it is impoffible that m xs and n zs can find place 
among u ys except by putting either two xs or two zs or an 
x and a z with one of the ys now as by the nature of the 
fuppofitions there cannot be two xs nor two zs to one y we 
muft have the inference ixz as often as there are units in the 
excefs oimn over u that is 

ixyyzw — u xz 

next let us take zxy zjy there may be two in 
ferences perfeuy diftinft from each other the connexion of 
which can only be explained in the more general fyftem to which 
we fhall prefently come firft let m and s together exceed ij 
then m s — u of the ys have the common property of being 
xs and of being clear of the n zs accordingly we have 

wx y z j y w j— x z 

l 



 on the numerically 

next let j be greater than u take the s ys among which 
no one of the n x is found becaufe j is greater than u n 
is greater than u — j the number of ys left accordingly 
n — u — of the n zs cannot be any ys and therefore cannot 
be any of the m xs which are ys hence we have 

wxy zjywx j— iz 

in the appendix to this chapter at the end of the work will 
be feen the manner in which all the ariftotelian fyllogifms can 
be brought under the firft cafe and the firft inference of the 
fecond cafe no ariftoteli fyuogifm can be deduced from the 
fecond inference except what j in which cafe it agrees with 
the firft for when s is not u we muft to make liich a fyllo 
gifm have zj and then to make zxy ariftotelian s not 
being ly we muft have all the zs in or f we thus get 
yx jyz the premifes ofbokardo but the conclufion is 
iixfj — iz that of bokardo being jxz and this will 
be found to be the only ariftotelian fyuogifm which has this 
fecond and numerically quantified inference depending upon the 
number of zs exceeding the number of ys unnamed in the par 
ticular premife 

i now proceed to fuppofe that all the quantities are taken into 
account some preliminary confiderations will be ufeful as 
follows 

let two propofitions be called identical when either of them 
being true the other muft be true alfo fo that nothing can be 
inferred from the one which does not equally follow from the 
other such propofitions are xy and yx fuch are xy 
and yx and fo on again two propofitions may be identical 
relatively to a third thus p being true q and r may either 
follow from the other accordingly as long as it is underftood 
that p is true q and r may relatively to that fuppofition be 
treated as identical 

the word identical as applied to propofitions is here made to 
mean more than ufual but not with more licenfe than when the 
word is applied to names thus man and rational animal are 

 i was not in poitefiion of the fecond inference till i had written what is 
in page 



definite syllogifm 

not identical names qua names for they neither pell nor found 
alike the identity underftood is that of meaning where one 
applies there fhall the other apply alfo similarly as to propo 
fitions of which fubjeft predicate and copula are the material 
parts juft as pelling and found are thofe of names identity does 
not confift in famenefs of parts nor in reducibility to famenefe but 
in fimultaneous truth or falfehood fo that what either is be it true 
or falfe the other is alfo in every cafe thus two propofitions 
one of which fignifies that an end has been gained and the other 
that the fole and fufficient means of gaining it have been ufed 
are identical 

all the theory of names their application or nonapplication 
may be applied to propofitions their truth ox falfehood to fay 
that a propofition is true in a certain cafe is to fay that a certain 
name applies to a certain cafe to fay that it is lie is to fay 
that a certain name does not apply but that its contrary does 
that contrary is what logicians ufually call contradi£fory and 
the name is not fimply true or falfe but the adjeftive attached to 
the propofition the conditions under which we are to peak 
limit us to a number of cafes which conftitute what we may now 
call not the univerfs of the names in the propofitions but the 
univerfe of the truth or falfehood of the propofitions thus we 
hall fuppofe ourfelves now to be fpeaking not of all inftances to 
which the name u applies but of all in which the propofition u 
is true ot in which the name true u applies a cafe in 
which a propofition p is true may be marked p one in which it 
is falfe p we may now apply the names fubidentical c and 
the fymbols together with all the fyuogifms complex and fimple 
but on each a remark may be neceffary 

subidenticaly identical and fuperidenticau if p be a propo 
fition fubidentical of q that is if every cafe in which p is true be 
one in which q is true but fo that q is fometimes true when p 
is not the propofition q is ufually mentioned as effential to p 
and as a neceffary confequence of it whenever p is true q is 
true q neceffarily follows from p if q be falfe p cannot be 
true q is effential to p are all mere fynonymes accord 
ingly neceffary confequent and fuperidentical or identical are 
fynonymous terms that is page neceffary confequent and 
fuper affirmative identity of courfe confifts in each propofition 



 on the numerically 

being true when the other is true i think that according to 
general notions it would be held more juft to fay that a propo 
fition contains its neceflary confequence than that it is contained 
but a moments confideration will fliow that the latter analogy is 
at leaft as found if the fecond be true whenever the firft is 
true it may be true in other cafes alfo fo that we only fay the 
iecond contains the firft and it may be more 

subcontrary contrary and fupercontrary it is ufual to call 
 no x is y and every x is y by the name of contraries 
and to fey that contraries may be both felfe but cannot be both 
true this is a technical ufe of the word in common lan 
guage we fbould fay that either a propofition or its contrary muft 
be true have you any thing to fay to the contrary generally 
means what a logician would exprefs by putting the word con 
tradi£fory in the place of contrary i am compelled to ufe the 
words contrary and contradiftory as fynonymous at which com 
pulfion i am well pleafed never having feen any good reafon 
why in the fcience which confiders the relations of disfa the 
contraria ihould be any thing but the contra di£fa the proper 
word for contrary commonly ufed to exprefs the relation of xy 
and x y is fubcontrary here are two propofitions p and q 
which cannot both be true but may both be falfe here is a pair 
which can never be afterted of the fame inftance and of which 
in many inftances neither can apply in the fame manner the 
propofitbns x y and x y ufually called fubcontrary for no 
reafon that i can find except that they are written under the fb 
called contraries in a fcheme or diagram very common in books 
of logic fhould be called fupercontrary they are never both 
falfe and may be both true this is a complete inverfion of 
the uiiial propofitions an inverfion which feems to me to be 
imperatively required if only my ufe offub znafuper in chapter 
iv be allowed 

in applying thefe names to propofitions it muft be remem 
bered that we make the fame fort of afcent which we make in 
pafhng from fpecific to univerfal arithmetic in ufing a fymbd 
to ftand for any number at pleafure for inftance — perh 
it may be thought that x y and x y may fometimes be only 
contraries and not fupercontrarie becaufe there may be names 
which make one only true and not both but this is not corred 



definite syllogifm 

for we are confidering the propofidon itfclf as an inftance among 
propofitions not the propofition as flibdirifible into inftances in 
which name is compared with name in peaking of propo 
fitions it is change from ufe of one name to ufe of another or 
from ufe of one number to ufe of another which is change of 
inftance not change from one inftance of name to another 
and juft as in a univerfe of names every name introduced is 
fiippofed to belong or not to belong to every inftance in that 
univerfe fo in a univerfe of propofitions i fuppofe every propo 
fition or its contrary to apply whether it be or be not known 
which applies in every inftance we have never confidered 
fuch a thing as the univerfe u in which there are cafes in which 
neither x nor x applies we liippofe there is always a power of 
declaring that the name x muft either belong or not belong 
to each inftance in like manner all the propofitions in each 
univerfe now confidered are fuppofed to be connected with all 
the names in queftion fo that x y being two of them in their 
order of reference ai or oi is true in each cafe and a or o 
el or l and e or p we might if we pleafed enter upon a 
wider fyftem for though we cannot imagine of any obje£l of 
thought but that it is either x or not x be x what name it 
may yet we can imagine of propofitions that they may be wholly 
inapplicable as being neither true nor lfe the firft afierdon 
is all the more true that it could hardly be exemplified without 
exciting laughter as i fliould do if i reminded the reader that a 
book is either a cornfield or not a cornfield we have never 
confidered names under more predicaments than two never 
for inftance as if we were to fuppofe three names x xj x of 
which everything muft be one or the other and nothing can be 
more than one but we ftiould be led to extend our fyftem if 
we confidered propofitions under three points of view as true 
falfe or inapplicable we may confine ourfelves to fingle alter 
natives either by introducing nottrue including both falfe and 
inapplicable as the recognized contrary of true or elfe by con 
fining our refults to univerfes in which there is always applica 
bility fo that true or falfe holds in every cafe the latter hypo 
thefis will beft fuit my prefent purpofe 

this digreffion is fomewhat out of place here but i have 
preferred to retain the matter of it until i had occafion to ufe it 



 on the numerically 

i now proceed to affert that the fimple numerical propofition 
has no occafion for a numerically definite predicate let us 
confider firft an affirmative propofition lay of lo xs each 
is to be found among fome ys of courfe it is fuppofed 
there are or more ys in exiftence with this let us compare 
 xs are to be found among the ys thefe two propofitions 
are identical if xs be among ys there are xs among 
the ys and if xs be among the ys they are certainly 
ys put on more ys at pleafure andthey can be faid to be 
among ys in juft as many ways we can choofe more ys 
to make up the note that if the xs were among certain 
fpecified ys then though the firft propofition would give the 
fecond the fecond would not neceflarily give the firft but we 
are now fuppofing that numerical feleftion is only numerically 
definite definite as to the number not as to the inftances which 
make up that number when therefore we lay xs are 
among ys we lay neither more nor lefs than when we lay 
 xs are among the ys it is in fa£l of the xs are 
of the ys and the converfe of the ys are of the xs is 
the fame propofition 

now let us take a negative propofition of the xs are not 
to be found any one of them among fome ys abbreviated 
into xs are not in ys if there be ys in exiftence 
this propofition muft be true mean x and y what they may 
it is as true as that the x which is one y is not any other y 
say there are or more ys take any xs you choofe and 
put them down on any ys you choofe then certainly 
there are ys left no one of which is any of thofe xs 
again if there be xs in exiftence ftill the propofition muft 
be true for if the ys were all there are and they were all 
xs there ftill remain xs which are not any one in the ys 
accordingly the propofition m xs are all clear of n ys when 
ever either the whole number of xs or the whole number of 
ys exceeds m n fays no more than is conveyed in our perma 
nent underftanding that no obje£l of thought can be more than 
one x or one y but let it be otherwife let neither xs nor 
ys be as many as wx in number say there are xs and 
 ys and let xs be clear of ys there muft now be 
at leaft — or ys which are no xs at ally and at 
leaft — o xs which are no ys at all fuft it is 



definite syllogifm 

plain that there are no xs among thofe ys which are clear of 
 ys for there are but ys in all therefore at leaft 
of thefe xs muft be xs which are not ys which with 
xs that may be ys will be clear of the remaining ys 
therefore xs at leaft are not ys again there are no 
ys among thofe xs which are war of xs for there are but 
 xs in all five ys which are not xs muft exift which 
with that may be xs will be clear of the remaining xs 
accordingly if the whole numb of xs be j and the whole 
number of ys be i the propofition there are m xs which are 
no one to be found among n ys is effentially true of every cafe of 
that univerfe whenever z is lefs than either or u but 
when mn is greater than both and i there are two propo 
fitions neceflarily involved which are not effentials of all cafes 
of that univerfe namely that there are — g ys which are 
not any xs and wf — i xs which are not any ys 

but it may be afked if n ihould be lefs than and mn 
greater than but ftill lefs than may we not affirm that 
z — u xs are not ys undoubtedly we may but then we 
do not affirm fo much as already belongs to every cafe of the 
univerfe for if be greater than u no more than u xs can be 
ys and there are left — u xs which cannot be ys and — ly 
is in the cafe fuppofed more than i — 

let v be the number of inftances in the univerfe j and u being 
the number of xs and of ys the following ufes of the notation 
will be readily feen to exprefs preceding refults or others imme 
diately deducible

 on the numerically 

i now examine the modes of contradifting ixy and ix y 
as to the firft it is obvious that m always meaning that m are 
but that more may be either m or more xs are ys or elfe 
— mi or more xs are not ys the contradidlion then is 
either of the equivalents 

g„ixiy anduwiygx 

it will be fatisfelory to evolve the contradiftion of mx y 
by a method which wfll again demonftrate the cafes in which no 
contradiftion exifts or in which the propofition is always true 
let us put the two names in the leaft fevourable pofition for 
making mxiny true let then be the number of xs which 
are not ys all the reft being ys take the p xs which are not 
ys p muft not be fo great as m for then the propofition is 
made good by the xs which are not any ys and mp from 
thofe which are ys all the m xs thus obtained are clear of 
n—mp or nmp ys let this juft be n that is let 
pzmnn then — the number of xs which are ys is 
j— z— j or i yim—n let but one more x be y 
and the propofition begins to be contradidled for now i — 
u— i xs are not ys we muft take up u — of thofe which are 
ys to make m xs and there only remain u— i— or — i 
ys clear of the m xs and it is plain that if we cannot do it by 
ufing firft all the xs which are not ys at all ftill lefs can it be 
done by ufing thofe which are accordingly the contradidlion of 
mxiny is 

i rmn lxy 

then in order to have a propofition which can be contra 
di£ted m n muft be greater than or equal to j at leaft 
for otherwife fj— m— fi would be greater than u or more 
ys than n muft be xs which is abfurd and fimilarly 
muft be greater than n otherwife all contradiction is abfurd 
or mx y is always true 

afliiming thefe laft conditions however the contradi£tion of 
mx ny is made eafier to be capable of contradiftion it muft 
amount to w — jx jy now when — i xs are not 
ys and no more — — xs are ys one or more 



definite syllogifm 

above this or let u— — ixy and mxiny cannot be 
true 

thus much for contradiftoiy or contrary propofitions i 
fhall prefently confider the contranominal propofitions 

we muft guard ourfelves from prefcribing the ufe of any premife 
which neceflarily belongs to all cafes in the univerfe of propo 
fitions let p be a propofition which may or may not be true 
laid down as a premife and q a propofition which is true in 
every cafe let r be their neceffary confequence or legitimate 
inference then it is not whenever p and q are true r is 
true but whenever p is true r is true so fer as r is a con 
fequence of q lb far it is a confequence of every thing which 
neceflarily gives q and thus it is a confequence of the fuppofed 
conftitution of the univerfe from which the propofitions are 
taken now this conftitution is always underftood it may be 
a convenience that r fhould bededuced by firft deducing q but 
it cannot be a neceflity and r is a confequence of p and this 
conftitution not of p and q 

for example let the univerfe of propofitions be all that can 
be formed out of the fuppofitions of the exiftence of xs and 
 ys and zs in one univerfe of names let us join to 
gether xy and loz y our rules of inference will pre 
fently fhow us that x loz is the neceflary confequence of 
thefe premifes but this refult is not only true when xy is 
true without anything elfe but even without that becaufe 
 fdls fhort of 

again we muft guard ourfelves from adopting the conclufion 

which follows from premifes when that conclufion is true in all 

cafes by the conftitution of the univerfe it is then a fort of 

fpurious conclufion legitimate enough as an inference but of a 

perfeuy diftin£t charafter from inferences which would bear 

• to this word as here ufed i have heard much objeuon and wheh i fiift 
took it it was unwillingly and for want of a better but on further confi 
deration i am well fatisfied with it the objeuon arifes from the idea of 
ialfe or worthlefs being generally attached to the word but though it may 
be ufual for fpurious things to be worthlefs it is not neceffary if a london

doubt but for the premifes or would bear contradiftion under 
other premifes say that in the above univerfe we join the pro 
pofitions xy and z y both thefe propofitipns are 
capable of contradiftion the fecond is z vy u means 
but the fymbol reminds the reader that is all or y 
i being now by laws of inference xy z y

here is a cafe in which premifes capable of contradiftion give 
a conclufion which is not 

the rule of inference is obvioufly as follows we cannot 
fliow that xs are zs by comparifon of both with a third name 
unlefs we can afegn a number of inftances of that third name 
more than filled up by xs and zs that is to lay fuch that the 
very leaft number of xs and zs which it can contain are together 
more in number than there are feparate places to put them in 
if our premifes for example feparate fome ys and didlate 
that among thofe ys there muft be xs and zs it is 
clear that there muft be at leaft zs which are xs for if we 
put down the xs which are to go in and try to put the 
zs into feparate places we are ftopped as foon as we have filled 
up the remaining out of the ys and muft put the other 
 zs among the ys which have been made xs accordingly 
fo many xs at leaft muft be zs as there are units in the number 
by which the xs and zs to be placed together exceed the num 
ber of places for them all the other rules of inference are 
modifications of this for example to prove that xs are not 
zs we muft fliow fome number of inftances be they ys or ys 
or part one and part the other overfull in the above fenfe of 
xs and zs to the amount of at leaft fo that xs are zs 
or are not zs to prove that fome xs are ys we muft how a 
number of inftances in which the leaji numbers of xs and zs 

that the chances are rather in favour of their refembling the ware of peter 
pindars hero in this work a fpurious inference is that which pafles for 
the confequencc of certain premifes but does not in reality follow from 
thofe premifes any more than from an infinity of others being true by the 
conftitution of the univerfe it is made to have the mark of thofe premifes 
when in truth we cannot know whether thofe premifes be poflible or not 
until we have firft examined a conftitution which virtually contains our con 
clufion 



definite syllogifm 

which it can contain overfill it or in which the greateji number 
of xs and zs which it can contain underfill it or do not fill it 
though made completely feparate 

in examining the fundamental laws of fyuogiftic inference it 
is not neceffary to confider any thing but the pofitive forms 
for mxiny when not fpurious and we fliall fee that the 
fpurious cafes may be rejefted is i — jxjy which is 
fwfw— xy or wfw— xy there are then but two 
fundamental cafes one in which the predicates are the fame 
one in which they are contraries we fliall accordingly have to 
confider 

mxy h nzy and mxy h zy 

and it will prefently appear that not more than one even of 
thefe is abfolutely neceflary in each cafe we muft ak what 
colleftive inftances of y or of y or partly of one and partly of 
the other receive any dilation as to how they are to be filled 
with xs with xs with zs or with zs and what is the leaft 
number of each which can be allowed to every fuch coueftion 
but there is yet fomething to do fuggefted by the preceding 
remarks let us take one propofition a type of all we fliall 
have to confider fay mxy this means that xy is true to at 
leaft m inftances now this propofition may involve xy or 
xy or xy firft as to xy to get the leaft number of xs 
among the ys we muft put the greateft number among the ys 
if all the xs will go among the ys or if u be greater than or 
equal to there need be no xs among the ys but if not or if 
 be lefs than then — u xs muft be among the ys in every 
cafe accordingly 

mxy gives — wxy 

where by — u underftand o not only when is equal to but 
when it is lefs this refult is fpurious fince it is true or falfe 
by the mere conftitution of the univerfe independently of mx y 
secondly as to xy since mxy is equally zyx the lame 
reafoning fliows that 

mxy gives u— xy 

where u— is to be underftood in the fame way this refult is 
alfo fpurious for a like reafon 



 on the numerically 

thirdly as to xy since there muft be m xs among the ys 
the greateft poffible number of xs is d— if this be as great 
as i— i the whole number of xs there need be no xs among 
the ys but if i— wx be lefs than i— there muft then be at leaft 
i— i— — i xs among the ys or ym— — j confequently 

wxyyot— — i xy 

i here put the fign becaufe thefe proportions are really equi 
valents treat the fecond in the lame way as that which de 
duced it from the firft and we have 



i w— u— xyy i i— u— i — i— u — i— xy 

ixy 

 um be not greater than u lj the equivalent does not exift 

we are already well acquainted with one cafe of this propofition 

let ot then wxy is xy and the equivalent becomes 

y— jxy which as i— i is the whole number of ys is yx 

the rule is if two names have a certain number of inftances 

at leaft in common to the whole number in the univerfe add 

that number of inftances and fee if the fum exceed the whole 

number of inftances of both names together if it do fo the 

excefs fliows the leaft number of inftances which the contraries 

of thefe two names muft have in common follow this rule 

and we have 

wxyi ot— u— i xy 

otxy w— jxy 

ntjly jot— xy 

fwxy u ot— ixy 

here are exhibited the equivalent contranominal forms the 
following refults may now be deduced 

firft thefe contranominals being formed in the lame way 
each from the other in any one pair whatever we prove of the 
firft from the fecond we alio prove of the fecond from the firft 
 the mathematician would call them conjugate pairs next fince 
all the four pairs are but verfions of the firft with difference of 
names whatever we prove univerlally of the firft pair we prove 
of all now taking the firft of any pair and making it poffible 
which is done by allowing m not to exceed the number of either 
of the names mentioned the fecond may be poffible or impoffi 



definite syllogifm 

ble according as the fubtradhon indicated can be done or not 
but whenever the fecond is impojjible the firfl is fpurious take 
xy and let iw— — xy be impoffible or um and ftill 
more v lefs than lfu now as all the xs and r ys muft find 
place in the v inftances of the univerfe and j exceeds i we 
muft in every cafe of the univerfe of propofitions have at leaft 
li— vxy but vkm is lefs than or — greater 
than m confequently mxy is fpurious a larger propofition 
being always true 

as we are not to admit fpurious propofitions among our pre 
mifes we had better write all premifes double putting down each 
of the forms and making double forms of inference the pre 
fence of the fymbols of all neceflfary fubtraftions will remind the 
reader of the fuppofitions which muft be made to infure a legiti 
mate fyuogifm i now take the feveral forms 

m xy n zy iixz 

i lj xy i— f— i zy i — i— i— oz 

the law of inference here tells us page that mn being 
greater than u i — ixz be it fpurious or not follows from 
the upper premifes the lower premifes alfo give their inference 
if 

yz— i— j y— f— u be greater than i— u 

vvi being the number of the ys this laft is equivalent to fay 
ing that iw is greater than f firft remark that 
one fpurious premife neceflarily gives a fpurious conclufion say 
that i m is lefs than or that mxy is fpurious then 
fince yf is lefs than j and n does not exceed f it follows 
that vmn is lefs than l w f whence the contranominal 

of the conclufion does not exift or the conclufion is fpurious as 
aflerted 

next obferve that the conclufion may be fpurious though 

neither of the premifes be fo for though v m be greater than 

l u and than f and therefore yot greater than 

 fi or i fw y— j greater than u f it by no 

means follows that vm n alone is greater than u f it 

is alfo vifible in the mode of formation of the fecond inference 

that to ay y tw exceeds j and v n exceeds f jj only gives 



 on the numerically 

exijience to the premifes to give them conclufion the fiim of 
the two exceffes muft itfelf exceed i— j the whole number 
of ys 

thirdly we muft not omit to examine the poffible cafe in 
which a premife is partially fpurious for example there are 
xs and ys in a univerfe of inftances accordingly f 
— or of the xs muft be ys let one of the premifes be 
xy this is not then all contingent and capable of contra 
diftion we only learn fdmething about out of the xs and 
i call this propofition partially fpurious but it will give no 
trouble for we muft deal with the premifes and their contra 
nominal equivalents before we can pronounce for a conclufion 
and of two propofitions which are contranominal equivalents of 
each other one mujl be partially fpurious to fliow this obferve 
that if triky be not partially fpurious it is becaufe u is greater 
than j or v than l u ij or v— i— i than v but 
then the numbers of xs and ys together exceed the whole num 
ber of inftances in the univerfe whence feme xs muft be ys or 
the contranominal equivalent of nixy is partially purious 

now to write down the various forms of inference there 
are fixteen ways of trying for an inference we may combine a 
propofition in x y or xy or xy or xy with one in xz or xz 
or xz or xz but thefe fixteen cafes really combine four and 
four into only four diftinft cafes thus the one we have been 
confidering really contains the combinations of xy and yz 
x y and yz xy and yz and xy and yz it is in our power to 
make either pair the principal pair and to give the other pair as 
contranominals of the firft pair 

thus we may write the cafe of inference we have been con 
fidering as in the firft of the following lift the others being ob 
tained from the firft by changing x into x or z into z or both 
the fign f placed in the middle implies the coexiftence of the 
four propofitions and independent numeral letters are introduced 
as feen which will prefently be connefted with the others by 
equations inftead of being exprefled in terms of them

this cafe apply with certain changes

tions i and i muft change places 

here z and z change places 
muft i and in the equations 

here x and x and alfo z and z 
change places as muft and 
and and in the equations

in the new manner of writing the form we have already con 
fidered being the firft of the four we have juft written 

 for y w— i— u • p for mi n n 

 fory— f— for t — j——f 

let us write rj i for i— tz—u y— f the numbers of xs 

ys and zs and then vn f being all the fame for 
each is u we may write u— for i— j for i— f and fo on 
that is in the difference of two one of which is accented we 
may interchange the letters if we pleafe the equations of con 
ne£bion for the firft or ftandard cafe are then 












pzm n 



or w l— v 
or mf— i— 







ormhh 
or ¦

for the fecond cafe we muft write wmh— i — i 
and fo on i now proceed to the feveral divifions into which 
our ufual modes of thinking make it convenient to feparate the 
cafes of this moft general form 



 on the numerically 

firft when every thing is numerically definite in this cafe 
as feen every form requires an examination of the premifes and 
conclufion as to whether they are or are not purious 

secondly when t the number of inftances in the whole uni 
verfe of names is wholly unknown in this cafe i is indefinite 
when i is definite and vice verfd and fimilarly one at leaft of 
each two or u f or is indefinite there are then no ipu 
rious conclufions or which is the fame thing none which are 
known to be fuch for the fpurioufnefs of a premife or conclu 
fion confifts in our knowing that it muft be true of its two terms 
independently of all comparifon of thofe terms with a third 

thirdly when f are all indefinite as well as y in this 
cafe as here ftated there is no poffibility of inference we can 
not tell whether w be or be not greater than u if we do not 
know what i is in any manner or to any extent 

but here we introduce that degree of definitenefs by which 
we diftinguifh the univerfal from the particular or poffible parti 
cular fee page propofition if we can know that either of 
the two m and is the fame as u greater neither can be then 
we know that mn greater than n and at the fame time 
we make y univerfal in one or the other of the premifes and 
the fame if we can know that either nf or is u 

the following are the forms which may all be derived from 
the firft by ufing all the varieties of contrary nanies and contra 
nominal equivalents if we want for inftance to fliow the con 
nexion of the fourteenth with the firft we throw the firft into 
the form 

w i lxy yz i oxz 

we then change x into x and z into z changing at the 
fame time i into f and i into and thus we get 

 xy yzz loxz 

now for m j— i write nf that is for m write — jf 
and we have 

mxy yzw xz 

which is one of the forms of the fourteenth and i— xz 
is only the contranominal of w— xz

we have thus another mode of eftablifliing the completenefs 
of the fyftem of fyllogifm laid down in the laft chapter that is 
of the fyftem in which there is only the common univerfal and 
particular quantity thefe fyuogifms of numerical quantity in 
which conditions of inference belonging to every imaginable cafe 
are reprefented by the general forms which numerical fymbols 
take in algebra muft of neceflity be the moft general of their 
kind and examination makes it clear that except the preced 
ing there can be no fyllogifm exifting between x y z and their 
contraries many fubordinate laws of connexion might be no 
ticed between the general forms and their particular cafes thus 
each univerfal occurs three times each fundamental particular 
twice and each ftrengthened particular twice the firft form 
in pages gives only affirmative the fourth only negative 
premifes the fecond and third one of each kind commencing with 
a negative in the fecond and with an affirmative in the third 

there are two remarkable fpecies of fyllogifm or rather 
which ought to have been remarkable which i fhall now pro 
ceed to notice 

the diftinilion of larger and fmaller part when divifion into 



definite syllogifm 

two parts is made is as much received into the common idiom 
of language as the diftinftion of whole and part itfelf moft of 
the xs are ys is nearly as common as all the xs are ys 
though feweft of the xs are ys is only feen as moft of the 
xs are not ys the fyuogifms which can be made legitimate 
by the ufe of this language will do equally well for any fradbion 
provided we couple with it the fraftion complemental to unity 
which in the cafe of one half is one half itfelf let a and s 
ftand for two fraftions which have unity for their liim as and 
 let x y and x y indicate that lefe than the fraftion a 
of the xs are or are not ys let xy and x y indicate 
that more than the fraftion a of the xs are or are not ys 

then the following fyuogifms arife from the cafes with the 
numbers prefixed 



i yx yx xz 

 yx yz xz 

 yxfpyz zx 
 yx yz xz 



 yx hyzxz 

 yx yz zx 

 yxyzxz 
 yx jyz xz 



it will be feen that here are but three really diftinft forms of 
which the fimpleft examples are as follows 

moft ys are xs moft ys are zs therefore fome xs are zs 
moft ys are xs moft ys are not zs therefore fome xs are 

not zs 
moft ys are not xs moft ys are not zs therefore fome 

thinare neither zs nor xs 

it is hardly neceffary to obferve that in one of the premifes 
 more than may be reduced to as much as but not in both 
thus if twofevenths exaftly of the ys be xs and more than 
fivefevenths of the ys be zs it follows that fome xs are zs 

the above fyuogifms admit a change of premife as follows 
if we fay that more than ths of the ys are xs we thereby fay 
that lefs than f ths of the ys are xs or yx and y x are the 
fame propofitions thus moft are is equivalent to a minority 
none included are not hence we have 

yxfyzxz 
and fo on or we may combine the two forms as in 

yxfyzxz 



 on the numerically 

the abave are the only fyllogifms in which indefinite particu 
lars give conclufions by reafon of that approach to definitenefs 
which confifts in defcribing what fraftions of the middle term are 
fpoken of at leaft or at moft but they are not the only fyllo 
gifms of the fame general ipecies in every cafe inference follows 
when there is a certain preponderance and the largenefe of the 
inference depends upon the extent of that preponderance thus 
in there is an xz inference when whj exceeds 
fo many units as there are in this excefs lb many xs at leaft 
are zs now in every cafe a pair of univerfal premifes give in 
ference and in every cafe there muft be a degree of approach 
to univerfality at which inference begins the ordinary fyllo 
gifms i fufpeft are and are meant to be not fuch as every 
x is y every y is z therefore every x is z but generally 
fpeaking x is y and generally fpeaking y is z therefore gene 
rally fpeaking x is z and by generally fpeaking is meant 
the affertion that an enormous majority of inftances make the 
affertion true a fyuogifm of this fort is the oppofite of the a 
fortiori fyuogifm and might be faid to be true ab injirmiori if 
we have xy with p exceptions and yz with q exceptions 
then in form i we have w— jpj— y and — j 
£— jp— as longythen as the number of exceptions altogether 
fall fliort of the number of xs there is inference if the total 
number of exceptions be very fmall compared with the number 
of xs there is the generally fpeaking kind of inference ex 
amine all the univerfal cafes and it will be found that the ame 
law prevails namely that there is inference when the numbers 
of exceptional inftances in both premifes together do not amount 
to the number of inftances in the univerfal term of the conclu 
fion and that there is exceptional univerfality as we may call it 
in the conclufion whenever the whcde amount of exception is 
very fmall compared with that number of inftances 

this leads us to what i will call the theory of exceptional 
particular fyllogifms we have feen that the eight complex 
affirmatory fyllogifms which are all a fortiori in their conclu 
fionsr afford each two particular fyllogifms we have denoted 
coexiftence by and the coexiftence of two propofitions gives 
more than either let us denote exceptive coexiftence by — 
thus p — q means that the propofition p is true except in the 



definite syllogifm 

inftances contained in q thus xy — x y means that every 
x with fome exceptions is y this is of courfe ai — oi and 
only differs from l in the mode of expreffion not being fome 
more than none at all but fome lefs than all in the expref 
fion 

ai— ai— oaio 

we have the fymbol of the ab infirmiori fyllogifm ftated above 
fiibjeft to the poffibility of nonexiftence if the number of excep 
tions in the two premifes fliould exceed the number of inftances 
in the univerfal term of the conclufion if we look at aid as 
a fymbol defcriptive of premifes we fee one of the inconclufive 
forms that is a form from which we cannot draw an inference 
but this is only becaufe our inferences are all pofitive and imply 
aflertion of fufficiency in the premifes there is no ufe except 
to how the manner in which the parts of a fyftem hang together 
in declarations of infuffictency for we know that all colleftions 
of premifes whatever they may be fufficient for will be infuf 
ficient for an infinite number of different things and it is 
important to remember that while fufficiency is accompanied by 
muji be j infufficiency only allows may be from aiai the con 
clufion ai mtfi be true from aid and as far as thefe are con 
cerned it may be falfe accordingly aidoi and oiaioi may 
ferve to exprefs the two defecfts of ai — oiai — oiai — oi 
from aiaiai exifting in the ab infirmiori fyllogifm and poffibly 
preventing conclufion altogether juft as aioo and oaio 
£how the additional conditions by the fulfilment of which aiaiai 
is elevated into the a fortiori fyllogifm ddd it is worth 
while to dwell upon the varieties of this cafe the ab infirmiori 
fyuogifms of the ftrengthened particulars were previoufly confi 
dered 

in all the cafes yet treated we have had more or lefs the 
power of giving inftances in common language without recourfe 
to numerical relation exprefled in unufual terms this of courfe 
is always the cafe in the fyllogifms of chapter v and we 
have given one common injiance though never met with in books 
of logic from each fet of ab infirmiori fyllogifms but there are 
ftill cafes of the fame fort to be confidered though in our de 
finite relation page of all we ufually in books of logic at 



 on the numerically 

leaft make the relation exift for each propofition between the 
terms of the propofition itfelf yet it may be aked whether we 
cannot fometimes infer fuch a fpecies of univerfel as this for 
every z there is an x which is y z being one of the names 
of the fecond premife if we examine the firft two cafes which 
will be guide enough we fliall find the following refiilts from the 
new fuppofitions now made 

 wf gives ixy yzxz or if for every z 
there be an x which is y and for every x a z which is y 
then fo many ys as there are fo many things which are neither 
x nor z this fyuogifm has little new meaning and no new 
application it requires f and therefore xy and zy 

 wf gives f xy yzxz or if for every z there be 
that which is neither x nor y and if fome ys be zs there are 
as many inftances which are neither x nor z this is a new and 
effeftive form 

 gives myjjyzwxz a new form 

thefe two cafes will be prefently further confidered now 
obferve that if mn in the firft form or m n in the fecond 
be v that is if the pair m and be and or yi and or f and 
 we have inference of the kind required the firft form gives 
no new fyllogifm fince u is more than ys which are xs and ys 
which are zs to the number of t give the form i by the main 
law of inference page in the fecond form if mnuj 
we diftribute among the ys and ys zs and xs to the full number 
of both fo that wherever there are not xs that is wherever 
there are xs there are zs or xz as obtained from the form 

but everyway of conftruftingnxyhyzm — xz 
which gives wjt is only a cafe of aiaiai for m cannot 
exceed and n cannot exceed and mn being u or u a 
we muft have myf and i whence the aflertion made the 
forms we are now in fearch of fo far as quite new are all con 
tained in the two new ones above noted and of thefe the fecond 
is but a transformation of the firft the eight varieties derived 
from ufe of contraries or from the forms in page beginning 
with the fimpleft are 



cxy z„yx 
fxyhzy xiz 



fxy yz xz 
fx„y yfzxz 



eyx ziyxz 
fxy hwzy xz 



definite syllogifm 

yx yz zx 
xy yzizx 



thefe are fyllogifms which exhibit a curious kind of antago 
nifm to the particular fyllogifms take the fyuogifm aioo the 
terms being m yz we have then m y z y z m of 
courfe the conclufion m z is not legitimate from thefe premifes 
alone but if m have as many inftances as z then m z is 
legitimate for if ms as many as there are zs be among the 
ys and fome of the zs be not among the ys though all the 
reft were there would not be enough to match all the ms or 
fome ms are not zs now let m be a name given to an x 
which is y and let fuch xs have as many inftances as z and 
the above becomes the firft of the fyllogifms in the laft lift 
thus looi is legitimate if the quantity of the fubjeft men 
tioned in ii be taken from the zs the fecond fyllogifm is ejio 
altered into ojioi in the fame manner 

the reader may find all the refults of the above cafe in the 
following rule in which it is underftood that all the iiiperpropo 
fitions are to be written either way thus a is written xy 
or yx and o is xjy or y x page write down 
any pair of particulars followed by i if the pair be of the fame 
fign and o if the pair be of different figns as in ooi or loo 
accent the pair in contradiftion to either the direft rule page 
 as far as the words affirmative and negative are concerned 
that is let a negative beginning ifolate nothing and an affir 
motive beginning ifolate the middle propofition or elfe ac 
cent the pair according to the inverfe rule thus oioil 
and oot contradift the direft rule and ool and oioj 
preferve the inverfe rule to make thefe fyllogifins good in the 
particular way in queftion proceed thus — when the diresf rule 
is contradidled take the quantity of the firjl concluding term 
from the total of tht fecond if the fecond premife be affirmative 
and from its contrary if negative when the inverfe rule is 
preferved take the quantity of the fecond from the total of 
the firjl thus in oot the direfl rule is contradifted 

and it ftands wxy yf fecond premife is 
negative the total of its predicate f inftances that of the con 
trary accordingly fxjyhyizxz or fyxf

mvyz viymxzormy x z ymxz which 
is derived from one of the forms given by interchanging x 
and z 

this clafs of fyuogifms with tranfpofed quantity naturally leads 
to the queftion is it ufed do fuch fyuogifms occur in ordi 
nary or in literary life if not there is no reafon for felefting 
them from the infinite number of cafes which the numeri 
cally definite fyftem affords to try this fuppofe a perfon on 
reviewing his purchafes for the day finds by his countercheques 
that he has certainly drawn as many cheques on his banker and 
may be more as he has made purchafes but he knows that he 
paid fome of his purchafes in money or otherwife than by 
cheques he infers then that he has drawn cheques for fome 
thing elfe except that days purchafes he infers rightly enough 
but his inference cannot be reduced to a common fyuogifm with 
the names in queftion for terms it is really a fyuogifm of tranf 
pofed quantity as follows — 

for every memorandum of a purchafe a countercheque 
is a tranfacslion involving the drawing of a cheque 

some purchafes are not tranfaftions involving c 

therefore fome countercheques are not memoranda of pur 
chafes 

it may be worth while to give one inftance of the verification 
of the contradiftory form by page it appears that the con 
tradiftion of mxy is — w ixy or i— ixy and that 
of ixy is i— mh jxy or — ixy 

to rnky join the contrary of i — ixz or ij— i 
— ixz we have then 

myxh iim— izx 

the inference of which is n lhii— m— — yz that is 
j— iyz the contrary of yz 

returning to the forms in page it wiu be obferved that we 
have no double inferences in every cafe we have made ufe of 
one form of inference if u be known the other is a real equi 
valent or elfe it is impoffible and as we have feen then the 



x 



definite syllogifm 

firft is fpurious if v be not known then the fecond is either 
perfehy indefinite or elfe identical with the one chofen ex 
amination will how that in every one of the cafes cited in page 
 the neglefted form of inference is only faved from perfefl 
indefinitenefs when we are able to apply the word all to one or other 
of the terms the number being as indefinite as before the rela 
tion thus obtained being definite take the firft form and make 
j by the firft inference we then get the fyuogifm iiaji by 
the fecond we get jy— ixz indefinite both in number 
and relation we do not know what y and f are if we 
knew as much as that mu is lefs than l f we fliould know 
our inference to be fpurious it being not the lefs an inference 
now add the condition mi the firft inference gives the fyl 
logifm aiaiai the fecond inference now becomes u—ixz 
definite relation enters and we have zx or xz or ai as 
before and the fame of the other forms 

the reader may perhaps fuppofe that i ought to have com 
menced this chapter with the complex numerical fyllogifm in 
imitation of the method which i followed in treating the ordinary 
fyllogifm but in truth there is no fyftem of complex fyllogifm 
of perfeft numerical definitenefs both in premifes and conclufion 
to fliow this let mxy with the comma mean that there are 
exadlly m xs which are ys neither more nor fewer accord 
ingly niyky is a fynonyme for wxyjii— wxy now com

mxy r xyz y rzy 

we then have mxy nzy w f — jxz 
j—wxyhi— zyj— m— xz 

mxy zyixz 
j— wxyfwzy — wxz 

 i muft again remind the reader of the diftinlion between jpurious and 
illegitimate which exifts in my languztge the fpurious inference follows 
from the premifes and is perfeftly good and true but from the conftitution 
of the univerfe it will always be true whatever premifes in that univerfe are 
taken the illegitimate inference is that which does not follow from the 
premifes a conclufion not knotun to be fpurious that is there not being 
the means of knowledge not fpurious but an illegitimate conclufion can 
not be made legitimate that is following from the premifes by any further 
knowledge 



 on the numerically definite syllogifm 

two only of thefe have meaning let them be the two upper 
ones we can affign then z or z to — i — or 
to i— n of the xs but there are not all of the xs here for 
m is lefe than vj and than whence m is lefs than ii or 
m v lefs than the reft of the xs li— i in number

chapter ix 

on probability 

the moft difficult inquiry which any one can propofe to 
himfelf is to find out what any thing is in all probability 
we do not know what we are talking about when we aflc fuch a 
queftion the philofophers of the middle ages were much con 
cerned with the v or ejence of things they argued to their own 
minds with great juftice that if they could only find out what a 
thing is they fhould find out all about it they tried and failed 
their fucceflbrs taking warning by their example have inverted 
the propofition and have fatisfied themfelves that the only way 
of finding what a thing is lies in finding what we can about it 
that modes of relation and connexion are all we can know of the 
eflience of any thing in fliort that the proverb tell me who you 
are with and i will tell you what you are applies as much to 
the nature of things as to the charafters of men we are apt 
to think that we know more of the effence of objefts than of 
ideas or rather of ideas which have an objeftive fource than 
of thofe which are the confequence of the minds zsdon upon 
them i doubt whether the reverie be not the cafe at any rate 
when we content ourfelves with inquiry into properties and rela 
tions we have certain knowledge upon our moft abftra£l ideas 
the objeft of this chapter is the confideration of the degrees of 
knowledge itfelf that which we know of which we are cer 
tain of which we are well aftured nothing could periiiade us to 
the contrary is the exiftence of our own minds thoughts and 
perceptions the two laft when actually prefent this higheft 
knowledge this abfblute certainty admits of no imagination of 
the poffibility of falfehood we cannot by ftopping to confider 



on probability iji 

make ourfelves more fure than we are already that we exift 
think fee c next to this come the things of which we can 
not but fay at laji we are as certain of them as of our own exif 
tence but of which neverthelefs we are obliged to fay that we 
arrive at them by procefs by reflecslion thefe we call necejfary 
truths page the necejjity of admitting thefe things caufes 
fome to imagine that they are merely identities that they amount 
to faying that when a thing is it is but this is not correft to 
fay that two and two make four which muft be and that a 
certain man wears a black coat when he does fo both involve 
the pure identity that whatever is is and not one more than 
the other nor is two and two identically four though necef 
farily fo our definitions of number arife in the procefs of am 
ple counting throw a pebble into a bafket and we fay one 
throw in another and we fay two yet one more and we fay 
three and fo on the full definitions of the fucceffive numbers 
are feen in 

 i i i i i nii ic 

that three and one are four is definition it is our pleafure to 
give the name four to f i but that is f is neither 
definition nor pure identity it is not even true that two and 
two is four that 

i il i is llfhi 

it is true no doubt that two and two is four in amount 
value c but not in form conftruftion definition c 

there is no further ufe in drawing diftinftion between the 
knowledge which we have of our own exiftence and that of two 
and two amounting to four this abfolute and inaftailable feel 
ing we hall call certainty we have lower grades of knowledge 
which we ufiially call degrees of beliefs but they are xty degrees 
of knowledge a man knows at this moment that two and two 
make four did he know it yefterday he feels perfectly certain 
that he knew it yefterday but he may have been feied with a 
fit yefterday which kept him in unconfcioufhefs all day and 
thofe about him may have been warned by the medical man not 
to give him the leaft hint of what has taken place he could 
fwear as oaths are ufually underftood that it was not fo if he 






ijl on probability 

could not fwear to this no man could iwear to anything except 
neceffary truths but he could not regard the affertion that it 
was not lb as incapable of contradidlion he knows it well but 
as long as it may poffibly be contradifted he cannot but fay that 
he might know it better 

it may feem a ftrange thing to treat knowledge as a magnitude 
in the fame manner as length or weight or furface this is 
what all writers do who treat of probability and what all their 
readers have done long before they ever faw a book on the fubjeft 
but it is not cuftomary to make the ftatement fo openly as i 
now do and i confider that fome juftification of it is neceffary 

by degree of probability we really mean or ought to mean 
degree of belief it is true that we may if we like divide pro 
bability into ideal and objeftive and that we muft do fo in order 
to reprefent common language it is perfeduy correft to fey it 
is much more likely than not whether you know it or not that 
rain will foon follow the fall of the barometer we mean that 
rain does foon follow much more often than not and that there 
do exift the means of arriving at this knowledge the thing is fo 
every one will fay and can be known it is not remembered 
perhaps that there is an ideal probability a pure ftate of the mind 
involved in this affertion namely that the things which have been 
are correft reprefentatives of the things which are to be that 
up to this ft of june above ftatenicnt has been true 
ever fihceetiarometer was ufed as a weatherglafe is not de 
nied by any who have examined it that the connexion of 
natural phenomena will for fome time to come be what it has 
been cannot be fettled by examination we all have ftrong rea 
fon to believe it but our knowledge is idealj as diftinguiftied 
from objesfive and it will be found that frame what circum 
ftances we may we cannot invent a cafe of purely objeftive pro 
bability i put ten white balls and ten black ones into an urn 
and lock the door of the room i may feel well affured that 
when i unlock the room again and draw a ball i am juftified 
in faying it is an even chance that it will be a white one if all 
the metaphyficians who ever wrote on probability were to witnels 
the trial they would each in his own fenfe and manner hold me 
right in my affertion but how many things there are to be 
taken for granted do my eyes ftill diftinguifli colours as be 



on probability ij 

fore some perfons never do and eyes alter with age has 
the black paint melted and blackened the white balls has any 
one elfe poflefled a key of the room or got in at the window 
and changed the balls we may be very fure as thofe words 
are commonly ufed that none of thefe things have happened and 
it may turn out and i have no doubt will do fo if the reader try 
the circumftances that the ten white and ten black balls will be 
found as diftinguifhable as ever and unchanged but for all 
that there is much to be aflumed in reckoning upon fuch a 
refult which is not fo objeftive in the fenfe in which i have 
ufed the word as the knowledge of what the balls were when 
they were put into the urn we have to aflume all that is re 
quifite to make our experience of the paft the means of judging 
the future 

having made this illuftration to draw a diftinftion i now pre 
mife that i throw away objeftive probability altogether and con 
lider the word as meaning tfiettafe of the mmd with refpeft to 
an affertion a coming event or any other matter on which ab 
folute knowledge does not exift it is more probable than im 
probable means in this chapter i believe that it will happen 
more than i believe that it will not happen or rather i ought 
to believe c for it may happen that the ftate of mind which 
j is not the ftate of mind which hould be dalembert be 
lieved that it was two to one that the firft head which the throw 
of a halfpenny was to give would occur before the third throw 
a jufter view of the mode of applying the theory would have 
taught him it was three to one but he believed it and thought 
he could how reafon for his belief to him the probability was 
two to one but i fliall fay for all that that the probability is 
three to one meaning that in the univerfal opinion of thofe who 
examine the fubjeft the ftate of mind to which a perfon ought 
to be able to bring himfelf is to look three times as confidently 
upon the arrival as upon the nonarrival 

probability then refers to and implies belief more pr lefs and 
belief is but another name for imperfedl knowledge or it may be 
exprefles the mind in a ftate of imperfeft knowledge there is 
accurate meaning in the phrafe to the beft of his knowledge and 
belief the firft word applying to the ftate of his circumftances 
with refpedl to external objefts the fecond to the ftate of his 



 on probability 

mind with refpeft to the circumftances but we cannot make 
any ufe of the diftinftion here what we know is to regulate 
what we believe nor can we make any effeftive ufe of what 
we know except in obtaining and defcribing what we believe or 
ought to believe according to common idiom belief is often 
a lower degree of knowledge but it is imperative upon us to 
drop all the quantitative diftinftions of common life or rather 
to remodel them when we come to the conftrustion of a 
fcience of quantity 

i have faid that we treat knowledge and belief as magnitudes 
i will now put a broad illuftration of what i mean we know 
fuppofe it known that an urn contains nothing but two balls 
one white and one black undiftinguifliable by feeling and we 
know fuppofe this alfo that a ball is to be drawn disjundlively 
then we know white will be drawn black will be drawn one 
or the other muft be how do we ftand as to white will be 
drawn and black will be drawn feparately clearly in no 
preponderance with refpeft to either may we then properly 
and reafbnably fay that we divide our knowledge and belief of 
the event one or the other into two halves and give one half 
to each i can conceive much objeftion to this fuppofition 
but whether they formally make it or not i am fure writers on 
probability al upon it and are accepted by their readers 

let us confider what magnitude is that is to fay how we 
know we are talking about a magnitude we know that when 
ever we can attach a diftinfl conception of more and lefe to dif 
ferent inftances fo as to fay this has more than that we are 
talking of comparable magnitudes we fpeak of a quantity of 
talent or of prudence we fay one man has more talent than 
another and one man more prudence than another but we never 
fay that one man has more talent than another has prudence if 
we occafionally fay he the fame one man has more talent than 
prudence it is only as an abbreviation we mean that he has not 
prudence enough to guide his talent juft as we might fay though 
we do not that there is more cart than horfe when the horfe 
cannot draw the cart jufl as fpeaking very loofely we do fay 
the prejfure of the atmofphere is not fifty inches meaning that it 
is not enough to balance the prefture of fifty inches of mercury 
in the barometer and thus both up to and beyond our mean 



on probability 

of meafurement we form to ourfelves diftinfl notions of com 
parable magnitudes and incomparable magnitudes as well as of 
the meaning of the fomewhat incorreft but eafily amended 
figures of fpeech by whurh we fometimes talk of comparing the 
latter 

but the objeft of all quantitative fcience is not merely magni 
tude but the meafurement of magnitude and when are we en 
titled to fay that we can meafure magnitude as foon as we 
know how from the greater to take off a part equal to the lefs 
a procefe which neceflarily involves the teft of which is the 
greater and which is the lefs and in certain cafes as it may 
happen of neither being the greater nor the lefs as to fome 
magnitudes the clear idea of meafurement comes foon in the 
cafe of length for example but let us take a more difficult 
one and trace the fteps by which we acquire and fix the idea 
fay weight what weight is we need not know the newto 
nian who makes it depend on the earths attradlion and the 
ariftotelian who referred it to an impulfe which all bodies pof 
fefs to feek their natural places are quite at one on their notions 
of the mcafiirable magnitude which their feveral philofophies dif 
cufe we know it as a magnitude before we give it a name 
any child can difcover the more that there is in a bullet and the 
lefs that there is in a cork of twice its fize had it not been for 
the fimple contrivance of the balance which we are well afliired 
how it matters not here enables us to poife equal weights 
againft one another that is to detecst equality and inequality 
and thence to afcertain how many times the greater contains the 
lefs we might not to this day have had much clearer ideas on the 
fubjeft of weight as a magnitude than we have on thofe of 
talent prudence or felfdenial looked at in the fame light all 
who are ever fo little of geometers will remember the time when 
their notions of an angle as a magmf ude were as vague as per 
haps more fb than thofe of a moral quality and they will alfo 
remember the fleps by which this vaguenefs became clearnefs 
and precifion 

now a very little confideration will fhow us that the moment 
we begin to talk of our belief the minds meafure of our know 
ledge of propofitions fet before us we recognize the relations 
called more and lefs does the child feel that the bullet has 



i jt on probability 

more fomething than the cork one bit better than an educated 
man feels that his belief in the ftory of the death of caefar is 
more than his belief in that of the death of remus let any 
one try whether he have not in his mind the means of arranging 
the following fet in order of magnitude of belief including within 
that term all the range which comes between certain knowledge 
of the falfehood and certain knowledge of the truth of an affer 
tion let them be i caefar invaded britain with the fole view 
of benefiting the natives two and two make five two 
and two make four caefar invaded britain romulus 
founded rome he will probably difcover the gradations of 
neceffary truth moral certainty reafonable prefumption utter 
incredibility and neceflary falfehood thefe are but names given 
to diflferent ftates of the mind with refpeft to knowledge of pro 
pofitions afferted and i fay they exprefs different ftates of 
quantity 

the only difficulty and a ferious one it can be made may be 
ftated in the following queftion — are we to confider the fort 
of belief which we have of a neceflary propofition as two and 
two make four that is abfolute knowledge to which contra 
diftion is glaring abfurdity — as only a ftrengthened or augmented 
fpecimen of the fort of knowledge which we have of any con 
tingent propofition fuch as caelar invaded britain which may 
have been or might have been felfe and can be contradi£ed 
without abfurdity i anlwer we can eafily fhow that the dif 
ference of the two cafes is connected with the difference be 
tween finite and infinite not between two magnitudes of dif 
ferent kinds the mathematician will eafily apprehend this 
and will look upon the various difficulties which furround even 
the explanation as upon things to which he is well accuftomed 
and which he underftands by many parallel inftances we can 
invent circumftances under which a contingent propofition hall 
make any degree of approach to neceffity which we pleafe but 
fo that no aftual attainment fhall be arrived at if an urn con 
tain balls and if one ball muft be drawn then the balls being 
all white it is neceffary that a white ball muft be drawn as 
neceffary as that two and two being in any place there are four 
in that place for there are no degrees of neceffity but let it 
be that there are black balls alfb at the rate of one to a thoufand 



on probability 

white ones the drawing of a white ball is no longer neceflary 
but there is ftill a ftrong degree of affurance that a white ball 
will be drawn we do not readily fee how much becaufe the 
urn has no vifible relation to our ufiial cafes of judgment but 
let it be made to reprefent the life of a youth of twenty and let 
the drawing of a white ball reprefent his living to come of age 
and of a black one his death in the interval there ought to be 
feven black balls to the thoufand white ones to make the cafes 
parallel and yet we know that our affurance of his furvival is 
generally very ftrong be it wife affurance or not it exifts and 
we aft upon it now fuppofe the rate to be one black to a mil 
lion of white the affurance is much increafed but ftill there is 
no neceflity the black ball may be drawn take one black to 
a million of million of white or a million of million of million 
c long before we have arrived at fuch a point we have loft 
all conception of the quantitative difference between our belief in 
drawing a white ball and our belief that two and two are four 
we fay it is almofi impojjible that one trial fhould give a black 
ball and this very phrafe is a recognition of the famenefs for 
which i am contending except on the fuppofition of fuch 
amenefs there is no almoji impojjible nor nearly certain be 
tween the impoflible and the poflible the certain and the not 
certain there muft be every imaginable difference if we do not 
admit unlimited approach for it will clearly not be contended 
that reprefenting certainty fay by we can make an ap 
proach to it by an uncertainty counting as fay but nothing 
higher reprefenting the ftate of abfolute knowledge by any 
one with a little confideration will fay that the laws of thought 
fix no numerical limit to our approach towards this ftate but 
that things hort of certainty are capable of being brought within 
any degree of nearnefe to certainty on fuch confiderations i 
hall affume that necefsty on the one hand a certainty for and 
impoffibility on the other a certainty againft are extreme limits 
which being reprefented by quantities may allow our knowledge 
of all contingent propofitions to be reprefented by intermediate 
quantities 

it muft be fully allowed nay imperatively infifted on that 
nothing in the numerical view tending to connecs neceffary and 
contingent propositions can at all leffen the diftindlion between 

n 



 on probability 

them nor give the latter any refemblance to the former except 
only in the quantities by which they are indicated though 
there be only one black ball to as many white ones as would fill 
the vifible univerfe yet between that cafe and the one of no 
black balls muft always exift the eftential difference that in the 
former a black ball may be drawn and in the latter it cannot 
but this very great diftinftion between the neceflarily certain 
and the contingent is it compatible with their being reprefented 
by numerical quantities as near to one another as we pleafe i 
anfwer that all who are acquainted with the relations of quantity 
are aware that nearnefe of value is no bar to any amount of dif 
ference of properties a common fradlion for inftance may 
be made as near as we pleafe in value to an integer but there 
do not exift even among propofitions more effential or more 
ftriking differences than thofe which exift between the properties 
of integers and of fraftions there are crowds of theorems i 
fliould rather ay unlimited crowds of claftes of theorems which 
are always true when integers are ufed and never true when 
fraftions are ufed let any quantities be named integer or frac 
tional and it is eaiy to make claites of theorems which are true 
for thofe quantities and not for any others however near to them 
the reader who is not a mathematician muft rely upon the know 
ledge of the one who is that the difference between two quan 
tities no matter how nearly equal may be connected with other 
differences as complete and by practice as eafily recognized as 
the difference between neceftary and contingent truth 

i will take it then that all the grades of knowledge from 
knowledge of impoffibility to knowledge of neceffity are capable 
of being quantitatively conceived the next queftion is are 
thefe quantities capable in any cafe of meafurement or of com 
parifon with one another at prefent we ftand as the child 
ftands with refpeft to the bullet and the cork perceptive of 
more and lefs but without a balance by which to make compa 
riibns to fhow the poftulate on which our balance depends 
let us fuppofe an urn which to our knowledge contains white 
black red green and blue balls one of each colour it is within 
our knowledge that a ball muft be drawn accordingly we have 
full knowledge and of courfe entire belief that the refuit no 
bair is impoffible and that white or black or red or green or 



on probability 

blue is neceffary to the refult white we accord a certain 
probability that is a certain amount of belief if a man tell us 
that white will be drawn we may hold him rafh but we do not 
pronounce his communication incredible let another tell us that 
 black or red or green or blue will be drawn and we hold him 
not fo rafli and his communication more credible we may 
hold with either if he will defcribe his knowledge and belief as 
partial and give them their proper amounts now whether we 
fliall proceed or flop fhort at this point depends upon our ac 
ceptance or nonacceptance of the following postulate — 

when any number of events are disjunctively poflible fo that 
one of them may happen but not more than one the meafure 
of our belief that one out of any fome of them will happen 
ought to be the amount of the meafures of our feparate beliefs 
in each one of thofe fome 

i mean that any one fhould ay a b c being things of 
which not more than one can happen my belief that one of the 
three will happen is the fum of my feparate beliefs in a and in 
b and in c this is the poftulate on which the balance de 
pends and there is a fimilar poftulate before we can ufe the 
phyfical balance the only difference and that but apparent 
is that we are to fpeak of weights coueftively and of events dif 
junsively the weight of the conjunftive mafs is the fum of the 
weights of its parts the credibility of the disjunftive event is the 
fum of the credibilities of its components there are feveral 
maybes any one of which may become a hasbeen when we 
peak disjunsfively it is of the willbe which cannot be faid of 
more than one the maybe of an event defcribed as contained in 
 a b c is to be reprefented as in quantity the fum of thofe 
in a in b and in c 

is it matter of mere necelety that talking of phyfical weight 
the weight of the whole is equal to the fum of the weights of the 
parts we have learnt to admit this poftulate of which no 
man ever doubted but no one can fay that it was neceffary 
the laws of matter and mind being both what they are the con 
nexion between phyfical colleftion and mental fummation is i 
grant neceffary the fimpleft of manual and the fimpleft of 
mental operations are and with us muft be concomitants 

but in the firft place it is not true that the weight of the 




 o on probability 

whole is equal to the fum of the weights of the parts in the 
manner in which the reader probably imagines it to be true let 
the firft part we hang on the balance be the weight which is 
correftly meafured by w then if we hang under it another 
weight as correftly reprefented by v we think we are quite fure 
when we fey that the colleftive mafs muft have a weight w f v 
becaufe its parts have the weights w and v but its parts have 

not the weights w and v the 
weight of v is diminifhed by the 
upward attradhon of w and is 
fey v— m the weight of w is 
as much increafed by the down 
ward attraftion of v and is w 
fmr and though v—m and 
w m added together do give v w yet it was not in this 
way that the reader made out his neceffary truth the univer 
fal equality of aftion and reaftion did not exift in the thoughts of 
the firft perfon who formed a diftinfl conception of the weight 
of the whole as compofed of the fum of that of the parts and he 
was only right by the fo far as he was concerned accidental 
•circumftance that two things of which he knew nothing coun 
terbalanced each others effefts nor do we know at this mo 
ment as of neceiety that the propofition is correft we have 
much reafon to think that the law of equality of aftion and reac 
tion is mathematically true but let it fail to the amount of only 
onegrain in a thoufend million of tons and the propofition is 
not true but only nearly true 

again the coexiftence of thofe laws of mind and matter 
which beft fo to fpeak fit each other and which make the phe 
nomena of the external world after due confideration appear to 
be almoft what they mtif have been is not to our apprehenfions 
a neceffary coexiftence we can imagine the following refult 
though we cannot trace what the fiiu confequences of it would 
be on the expreffion of the laws of thought conceive fentient 
beings to whom the fimpleft mode of arithmetical fucceffion is 
not o i c but i loo loop c their powers of 
numeration being fo conftrufted that the fecond of thefe fliccef 
fions has that charafter of fundamental fimplicity which we 
attach to the firft £ courfe their primary fymbols would be 



on probability 

fignificative of i c it would be impoffible for us to 
conceive any mode by which ten or any other number could be 
thus fundamentally attached to unity in a manner fhared by no 
third number but i am not faying imagine how this could 
be but imagine that it is there is no contradiction in the 
fuppofition either to itfelf or till we know much more of the 
mind than we now do to anything elfe beings fo conftituted 
would have logarithmic brains and if thus conftituted they 
were placed among our material laws of exiftence the manner 
in which the weight of the whole is to be inferred from thofe of 
the parts would be a profound myftery for ages only to be folved 
in an advanced ftage of mathematical fcience a recent mode 
of conftrufting mathematical tables which generally carries with 
it the name of its eminent inventor gaufs would conftitute 
one of their principal necefsties they would have to ufe it as 
their only mode except adual experiment of finding out that 
what we reprefent by and together make and this 
making would be a complicated procefs 

inftead then of trying to eftablifh it as perfeftly natural and 
neceflary to ay that our belief of one of the two a or b when 
both cannot happen is quantitatively fpeaking the fum of our 
belief in a and our belief in b i have rather endeavoured to 
fhow that the analogous cafes with which we firft think of com 
paring this propofition other kinds of compofition are not fo 
natural and neceflary as is fuppofed there are two ways of 
levelling by bringing up the lower or bringing down the higher 
and i particularly wifli in this chapter to prevent the reader 
from accepting the arithmetical doftrine of probability quite fo 
rapidly as is ufually done in furtherance of this objefl i pro 
ceed to the following poflible objeftion 

it may be faid you have by thus formally identifying proba 
bility with belief and ftating a poftulate which in exprefs terms 
has not the moft axiomatic degree of evidence rendered fome 
what difficult that which in the ordinary view of fimple chances 
is very eafy this charge i hope is true fuch was my inten 
tion at leaft and my reafon is that in the ordinary view of 
the fubjeft one of two things occurs either probability is fepa 
rated by definition from ftate of belief though it be known that 
the two words will afterwards be confounded without any per 



i on probability 

miieon or elfe the poftulate is tacitly aflfumed and the difficulty 
which i fuppofemyrdf charged with introducing is flurred over 
take a common queftion j — an urn has two white balls and 
five black ones there are feven equally likely drawings two 
white therefore the chance or probability of drawing a white 
ball is called twofevenths but the chance of either particular 
white ball is onefeventh now firft if any one fhould fay 
that this is mere definition i can of courfe allow it but it then 
remains to fhow what connexion this defined probability has with 
any ordinary acceptation of the word but if probability mean 
ing belief or fentiment of probability aftually exifting in the 
mind or index of the proper degree of belief c c — the 
above ftatement be made as fundamentally evident i fhould then 
ak how it is known that the probability of one or the other 
white ball being drawn is properly fet down as the fum of the 
probabilities of the feparate white balls and i cannot conceive 
any anfwer except that it is by an aflumption of the poftulate 
that fuch aflumption will finally be knowingly made on the 
fulleft conviftion by every one who ftudies the theory i have 
no doubt whatever nor that it has been made no matter in 
what words nor with what clearnefs of avowal by every one 
who has ftudied that theory and therefore i hold it defirable 
that the beginner fhould know what i have here told him 

it is iridifferent as far as the theory is concerned what nu 
merical fcale of belief we take we might if we pleafed copy 
fahrenheits thermometer fet down knowledge of impoffi 
bility as ° perfeft certainty as ° and other ftates of mind 
accordingly thus ° would reprefent perfedl indecifion 
belief inclining neither way an even chance but this would 
complicate our formulae the ufual and preferable plan is to af 
fume o as the index of knowledge of impoffibility i as that of 
certainty and intermediate fractions for the intermediate ftates 
this mode of eftimation makes formulae and proceftes fo much 
more eafy than any other that it muft be adopted but there is 
a ftrong objeftion to it in one point of view as follows 

when we fpeak of belief in common life we always mean 
that we confider the objeft of belief more likely than not the 
ftate of mind in which we rather rejeft than admit we call 
wwbelief when the mind is quite unbalanced either way we 



on probability 

have no word to exprefs it becaufe the ftate is not a popular 
one the quantitative theory calls by the name of belief every 
admiffion of poffibility when there is only one black ball to a 
million of white ones there is fome belief that a black ball will 
be drawn a much larger belief in a white one it would be 
advantageous in fome refpefts that o fhould reprefent the ftate 
of indifference that of knowledge of certainty and — i 
that of knowledge of impoflibility but this would complicate 
formulae too much i confider it therefore defirable to ufe the 
common meafures and formulae but to affociate them with the 
one juft propofed in the following manner 

when a perfon tells us that his belief in an aitertion is fay tv 
meaning that he confiders it for and againft or to againft 
we hould fay in common talk that he difbelieves but not very 
ftrongly in the language of this theory we fay that he both 
believes and difbelieves the latter more ftrongly than the former 
let us add that bis authority is againft the conclufion if he fay 
that it is in his mind an even chance or that he has no opinion 
one way or the other let us fay that he gives no authority either 
way if we adapt this definition to the fuppofition that i and 
— i reprefent the extremes of authority for and againft we have 
the following rules the meafure of authority is twice the mea 
fure of belief diminifhed by unity for when pofitive againft 
when negative the meafure of belief is half of unity increafed 
algebraically by the meafure of authority if a reprefent the 
meafure of belief and a that of authority then 

a— i ifa 

it is alfo advifable to have a term to reprefent what are ufiially 
called the odds some might think it defirable to rid the fubje£ 
as much as pofeble of words derived from gambling aftrono 
mers have done the fame thing with the phrafes of aftrology and 
chemifts with thofe of alchemy when it is for and againft 



 many minds and almoft uneducated ones can hardly retain an 
intermediate ftate put it to the firft comer what he thinks on the queftion 
whether there be volcanoes on the unfeen fide of the moon larger than 
thofe on our fide the odds are that though he has never thought of the 
queftion he has a pretty ftiff opinion in three feconds 



 on probability 

it might be fkid that the relative tejiimony for is and that 
againft f but the brevity of the firft phrafe will jnfure its con 
tinuance let who will try to change it 

the ordinary rule is a confequence of the notions hereinbefore 
laid down and of the particular mode of naeafurement adopted 
it is as follows — when all the things that can happen can be 
refolved into a number of equally probable or credible cafes 
fome favourable and fome unfavourable to the event under con 
fideration then the fra£hon which the favourable cafes are of all 
the cafes meafures the probability or credibility of the arrival 
of the event and the fraftion which the unfevourable cafes are 
of all ae cafes meafures the probability or credibility of the 
nonarrival there are for inflance in an urn white blacky 
and red balls in all it is aftumed that we know them to 
be equally likely to be drawn which here means no more than 
that we know nothing to the contrary that one ball mufl be 
drawn is fuppofed certainly known accordingly our belief in 
 one or another is reprefented i which is by the poftulate 
the fum of the feveral credibilities of the balls which laft are all 
equal therefore each ball has tv and by the fame poflulate 
the event one or other of the white balls or the drawing of a 
white ball has a of a black ball a of a red ball z 

inflances like the above in which we invent all the cafes and 
have arbitrary power over their number are the only ones on 
which we can employ a priori numerical reafoning they are 
alfo the only ones on which we can try experiments it is im 
portant to know whether as a matter of fail our belief nume 
rically formed will be approximately juftified by the refults of 
trial and this juftification is found to exifl in the following 
way it is a remote but certain conclufion from the theory 
requiring mathematical reafoning too complicated to introduce 
here that events will in the long run happen in numbers pro 
portional to the objeftive probabilities under which the trials are 
made for inflance — if a die be correftly formed fo that no 
one face has more tendency than another to fall upwards the 
probability of throwing an ace is that of not throwing an ace 
is the theory tells us its own worthleftnefs if in the long 
run notace do not occur five times as often as ace if 
trials were made the theory would tell us to expeft about

ones i will ftate an inftance 

throw a halfpenny up and if it give tail repeat the throw 
and fo on till head arrives and let this fucceflion be called zfet 
the probability that a fet fhall confift of one throw is fhewn 
by the theory to be that it fhall have two throws three 
throws j and fo on if a very large number of fets be tried 
we are to expeft that about half will be of one throw about a 
quarter of two throws about an eighth of three throws and fo 
on as long as the number is large enough to give any prope£l 
of fomething like an average this experiment has been tried 
twice once by the celebrated buffon and once by a young 
pupil of mine for his own fatisfasion both in fets the

can meafure the latter by a rule and fo train the organ to judge 
of lengths which cannot be approached or cafes in which the 
rule is not at hand 

i fhall now refer the reader to other works on the fubjeft for 
further details on the operative part and proceed to juft as much 
as is neceflary for the particular purpofe of the next chapter 
namely the application of the hypothefis of meafure of belief to 
queftions of argument and teftimony two theorems will be 
enough the firft relating to independent events the fecond to 
the probability of events which are neither wholly independent 
nor wholly confequent either upon the other the word event 
is ufed in the wideft poffible fenfe it does not even neceflarily 
mean future event unlefs our knowledge either of the cir 
cumftances or of the event itfelf thereby undergo fome altera 
tion it is nothing to us how whether it has happened or is to 
happen 

let there be two events p and q of which the probabilities 
are the fraftions a and h and let them be wholly independent of 
one another the arrival or nonarrival of either being perfeftly 
independent of that of the other the probability that both 
fhall happen is the produdl of a and h and fimilarly for more 
events than two suppofe to take an inftance that a and h 
is we muft then confider p as an event which has ways 
of failing to of happening if we would have an urn from 
which the credibility of drawing a white ball fhould be that of 
the happening of p we muft put in white balls and not 
white fay black balls similarly to reprefent q we muft have 
an urn of white and black balls now to aicertain the 
profpeft of drawing white from both urns we muft count all 
the cafes a ball from the urn of may be combined with one 
from the urn of in x or ways but a white ball from 
the firft urn may be combined with a white ball from the fecond 
in x or different ways there are then cafes in all 
 of which are favourable hence the probability in favour of 
white from both which is that of the two events both happen 
ing is

on probability 

similar reafoning may be applied to more events than two 
this theorem has a large number of confequences fome of 
which we may notice 

when a is the probability for i— is the probability againft 
this i fhall always denote by a fimilarly b will ftand for i — i 
and fo on 

required the probability that of a number of independent 
events pqr c one or more fhall happen let ajfc ice be 
the feveral probabilities then that of their all failing isthe pro 
duft tfv and that of their not all failing or of one or 
more happening is i— v accordingly if there be 
only two events for one or both we have i— i— tfi— 
wjich is ab—ab if the number of events be and all 
equally probablefo that abcy c for one or more we 
have i— or i — i— 

it is a confequence of this laft that however unlikely an event 
may be it is fure in the common fenfe of the word to happen 
if the trial can be repeated as often as we pleafe however 
fmall a may be or however near to unity i — may be taken 
fo great that — fhall be as fmall as we pleafe or — i —ay 
as near to unity as we pleafe or thd probability that the unlikely 
event will happen once or more in n times as great as we pleafe 
let i which means that the odds are to i againfl 
the event on any one trial the following rough deductions will 
fhow what kindof refults the formula gives true within an in 
flance or two when k is confiderable in inflances it is an 
even chance that the event happens once or more in it is 
 to i in to i to i to i 
and in it is ten thouland millions to i thus fuppofe at 
each trial it is a hundred to one againfl fuccefs then of thofe 
who try efforts as many will fucceed once or more as will 
altogether fail in the long run of thofe who try times 
only one of a thoufand will always fail a perfbn who will not 
examine an aftertion that comes to him with ten to one againfl 
it mufl count it an even chance that he throws away one or 
more truths if he follow his plan feven times 

let us now fuppofe that there are reafons why the feveral in 
flances which can arrive are not equally credible suppofe the 
urn to contain a white a black and a red ball and ourfelves to 



 on probability 

have reafbns to think the balls not equally probable or credible 
but that and are the proportions of the degrees of belief 
we fliould accord to them feverally if then bx reprefent the 
probability of a black ball x and x will reprefent thofe of the 
other two feverally by the poftulate ix reprefents that of one 
or the other but this is certainty whence x muft be tvj 
 j and are the probabilities of the white black and red 
balls that is to fey when the feveral inftances are unequally 
probable we muft count each inftance as though it occurred a 
number of times proportioned to its probability and then proceed 
as in the cafe of equally probable inftances thus in the above 
inftead of faying as we fhould do if the balls were equally pro 
bable that the probability of the white ball is 

i r • • 

we fay it is or — 

i i i bmsm m 

would do m being any number or fra£lion whatfoever 

now fuppofe two urns one of all white balls and the other 
of all black ones if we actually draw a ball and find it white 
we know that the urn chofen to draw from muft have been the 
firft the fecond could not have given that drawing but fup 
pofe the firft urn to have white balls to one black and the 
fecond one white to black if we now draw again and 
draw a white one not knowing from which we drew we feel 
almoft certain from the drawing that we have chofen the firft 
urn we ftill feel almoji certain that the fecond urn would have 
given a black ball this inverfion of circumftances this conclu 
fion that the circumftances under which the event did happen 
are moft probably thofe which would have been moft likely to 
bring about the event is of the utmoft evidence to our minds 
but the queftion now before us is are we to call it a fecond poftu 
late or is it deducible from the other one it is io deducible 
and is not a fecond poftulate but it has not been ufual to give a 
very diftindl account of the deduftion if it could not be made 

 so well eftablifhed is this ipecies of inverfion in the mind that both 
laplace and poiiton the two moft eminent mathematical writers on the fub 
je of the prefent century have in a certain cafe aftumed that an equation 
which gives the moft probable value of x in terms of j is therefore the one 
which gives the moft probable value of j in terms of x this is carrying 
the principle too far 



on probability 

the following procefs would no doubt be fufecient it has often 
been held io let the urns have white balls to i black and 
white balls to black then the probabilities of drawing a 
white ball from the two are y and which are in the propor 
tion of to if becaufe when we choofe the firft urn we 
have nearly five times as much chance of a white ball as the 
fecond one would give we conclude that a known white ball 
from an unknown urn is in that proportion more likely to have 
come from the firft urn we fliall have and for the proper 
degrees of belief in the two urns for if be that for the 
firft urn then x muft by the aflumption be that for the 
fecond and for one or the other we have jir but this is 
certainty whence x muft be 

to reduce this refult to dependence upon the firft poftulate 
proceed as follows the probability that two events are con 
nedy our belief that is in the connexion muft be the fame 
whether the two events or either of them have happened or 
whether they be yet to happen unlefs there be fomething 
in the happening which alters our knowledge and puts us in 
a different ftate for forming a judgment suppofe i make up 
my mind rightly or wrongly as to how far i will believe that 
a white ball if drawn will have been drawn from the firft urn 
an inftant after i am told that the trial i anticipated has been 
made and the contingency which i fuppofed has occurred a 
white ball has been drawn i know no more than i took myfelf 
to know in my hypothefis and cannot therefore have any 
means of altering my opinion now without altering the pro 
portions in the urns change the numbers of the balls fo that 
there may be the fame total number in each let them be 

 white black white black 

now put each ball in an urn by itfelf urns in all this 
gives ttt to y lj f choofe an urn at hazard but it 
was fb before as to the firft of the two urns for inftance was 
the probability of choofing that urn and j that of choofing one 
particular ball from it and x rr is if if we then remove 
all the urns with black balls fo that a white ball muft be drawn 
the chance of its being one of the is or if without 
removing the black balls we think of the probability of a white 



 on probability 

ball if drawn being of the or of the the credibilities of 
thofe fuppofitions are as to if having chofen an urn we 
find it contains a white ball the fame probabilities are ftill in 
that proportion 

the rules derived from fimilar reafoning whether for judging 
of the probabilities of precedents from an obferved confequent 
or for judging of the probabilities of events which reftrift each 
other are precifely the fame as follows if the probability of 
the obferved event fuppofed ftill future from the feveral poffible 
precedents feverally fuppofed aftually to exift be f c then 
when the event is known to have happened the probabilities 
that it happened from the feveral precedents are 

for the firft for the fecond c 



 a f a b c 

again if there be feveral events which are not all that could 
have happened and if by a new arrangement pr by additional 
knowledge of old ones we find that thefe feveral events are now 
made all that can happen without alteration of their relative cre 
dibilities their probabilities are found by the fame rule if b 
f c be the probabilities of the feveral events when not reftrifted 
to be the only ones then after the rcftriftion the probability 
of the firft is r j fecond r a 
and fo on 

we may obtain a very diftin£t notion of this laft theorem as 
follows suppofe two events which are among thofe that can 
happen and let one fay be twice as probable as the other this 
means that among all the independent and equally likely cafes 
there are twice as many favourable to the firft as to the fecond 
now fuppofe by fbme alteration of fuppofitions the introdu£tion 
of new knowledge for inftance it is found all the cafes remain 
ing as before that all are prevented from happening except thefe 
two events this new ftate of things does not alter the cafes in 
number accordingly the proportion of the probabilities of the 
two events is as before two to one but now one of them muft 
happen or the fiim of thefe probabilities muft be unity it 
follows then that one of them is and the other the fame 
reafoning may be applied to more complicated cafes 

it frequently happens when different problems are fblved by 



on probability 

the fame formula that they may be confidered as the fame pro 
blem in two different points of view and alfo that one and the 
feme problem may be confidered as belonging to either clafe 
for inftance — let there be two witneffes whofe credibilities 
or the probabilities that in any given inftance they are correft 
are a and b as long as we do not know that they are talking 
about the fame thing the probability that both will tell truth is 
ab but the moment we knowuhat they both affert the feme 
thing the problem is changed they muft now be either both 
right or both wrong before one might have been right and 
the other wrong to take the firft view of the problem we 
have now an obferved event both ftate that the circumftance 
did happen there are two precedents the event did or did 
not happen if it did the probability of the obferved event 
which is then that both are right would be ab if it did not it 
would then be i— i— a accordingly the probability that 
the obferved event did happen will be by the rule above ab 
divided by — i— a 

if we take the fecond view we have before the reftriftion 
four poflible cafes the probabilities of which are i i— a 
i— and i— i— i after the reftriftion only the firft 
and fourth are poflible whence the conclufion is as juft given 
full exemplifications of thefe methods will be found in the next 
chapter 



chapter x 

on probable inference 

there are two fources of conviftion argument and 
mony reafon why the thing fliould be ftatement that the 
thing is when the argument is necefltarily good we call it 
demonjiration when the ftatement can be abfolutely relied on 
we call it authority both words are ufed in lower than their 
abfolute fenfes thus very cogent arguments are often called 
demonftration and very good evidence authority 

i fliall fuppofe all the arguments i fpeak of to be logically 



 on probability 

valid that is having conclufions which certainly follow from 
the premifes if then the premifes be all true the conclufion is 
certainly true if i r c be the probabilities of the indepen 
dent premifes or the independent propofitions from which pre 
mifes are deduced then the produft abc is the probability that 
the argument is every way good 

argument being offer of proof its failure is only feilure of 
proof and the conclufion may yet be true but teftimony is an 
aflfertion of the truth of the conclufion and its failure can only 
be failure of truth if a propofition of euclid turn out to be 
badly demonftrated the enunciation need not therefore be falfe 
an argument may prove difprove or neither prove nor dis 
prove a teftimony cannot be true falfe or neither true nor 
falfe this diftinftion generally gains no more than a onefided 
admiffion perfons begin to fee it when fome overzealous bro 
ther writes weakly on their own fide of a queftion but they are 
very apt to think with refpeft to the other fide that anfwering 
the arguments is difproving the conclufion 

teftimony is for the above reafon more eafily underftood than 
argument it is the moft efffeftive mode of conveying know 
ledge to the uneducated but it muftnot be fuppofed that in 
any ftage of reafon argument can be the only vehicle of infor 
mation even on fubjedls called argumentative this point is 
one of great importance 

when argument is demonftration it eftablifhes its conclufion 
againft all teftimony the idea of an infallible witnefs bearing 
evidence againft a demonftrated conclufion is a contradi£lion 
that n confecutive numbers have a fum which is divifible by 
whenever n is odd is demonftrated if a thoufand of the beft 
qualified witneftes that ever lived both for honefly and arith 
metic were to fwear that they had difcovered very high 
confecutive numbers the fum of which is not divifible by 
any mere beginner in mathematics would be more fure that a 
thoufand good witneftes had loft their wits or their charafters 
than any one elfe can be of anything not admitting of demon 
ftration 

but when argument does not amount to demonftration not 
only is the truth or falfehood of the conclufion matter of credi 
bility but the iftue of the argument is not that mere truth or 



on probability 

falfehood it does not iftand thus according as this argument 
is good or bad fo is the conclufion true or falfe but according 
as this argument is good or bad fo is the conclufion true in this 
way or not true in this way that is either falfe or true in fome 
other way if we were to fay men are trees and trees have 
reafon therefore men have reafon we have a perfeftly logical 
argument falfe in the matter of both premifes but we cannot 
deny the conclufion 

suppofe now that an argument is prefented to us of which we 
are fatisfied that the likeywill prove their conclufions to be true 
in the particular modes afferted in nine cafes out of ten what 
are we to fay of the truth or falfehood of the conclufion we 
have of belief to its being true in one particular way how 
much fliall we add for other poffible ways are we to reft in 
the conclufion as having to i for it or are we to allow more 
we cannot fay let us confine ourfelves to the grounds we have 
got and believe or difbelieve not in the conclufion but in the 
conclufion as obtained in that one way 

i take it for granted that the mind muft have a ftate with 
refpeft to every aflfertion prefented to it with reafon or without 
reafon every propofition the terms of which convey any mean 
ing at once when brought forward puts the hearer into fome 
degree of belief or if we ufe the common phrafe of belief or 
unbelief including of courfe the intermediate ftate which is as 
clearly marked upon our fcale as any other men who are 
accuftomed to fufpend their opinion as it is called that is to 
throw themfelves into the intermediate ftate when they have 
no definite reafon to think either way are interefted in this 
queftion as much as any others if there be fome ftate though 
not numerically appreciable in which their belief muft be there 
is fome ftate which they would rather know numerically than 
not in which it ought to be in the preceding cafe fuppofe it 
known that to i or jy is granted to the conclufion from the 
argument alone and any one wiflies to fufpend his opinion as to 
the remaining tv is he to grant half of that and fay that 
i vf or is what he would wifli to make the meafure of his 
belief if he knew how the confideration of this queftion will 
enter among others 

the manner in which he deals with the refult of the argument 



 on probability 

muft depend upon tejiimony uflng the word in its wideft fenfe 
firft every man has as juft noticed a teftimony in his own 
mind as to every propofition he may fet out with the inter 
mediate ftate he may have no reafon to lean either way and 
may know it that is to fay he may have to apply an argument 
of t to an exifting probability of or he may have previous 
good reafon or bad reafon which makes him lean to the affer 
tion or denial and the meafure of this leaning muft then be 
combined with or he may have other teftimony to combine 
with that of his own previous ftate any way he cannot have 
a definite opinion on the bare truth or falfehood of the conclufion 
of the argument without appeal to the previous ftate of his own 
mind at leaft if not to that of others 

it is generally faid that we are to throw away authority and 
judge by argument alone that our reafon is to be convinced 
and not biafled by the opinion of others that no conclufions are 
worth anything except thofe which a man forms for himfelf all 
the forms in which this frequent caution is exprefled i take to 
be diftortions of the very needful warning not to allow authority 
more weight than is properly due to it a warning by the way 
which is juft as much wanted with refpeft to argument as to 
authority for every miftake which has been made by taking 
authorities on truji that is taking bad witnefles to prove the 
goodnefs of aflerted good ones one miftake at laft has been 
made by taking arguments on preponderance that is treating 
them as proving their conclufion as foon as they fliow it to be 
more likely than its contradiftion 

to form the habit of allowing authority no more weight than 
is due to it and the fame of argument is undoubtedly one great 
objeft of mental cultivation but it ought not to be forgotten 
that it is another and juft as great an objeft to form the habit of 
allowing them no lefs suppofe an argument of value t is pre 
fented and that at the fame time we have the teftimony of a 
witnefs againft the conclufion of whom we know that he leads 
us right times for each once that he mifleads us is there 
any fenfe in reducing this witnefs to one of no authority or of an 
even chance upon the principle of depending on argument only 
except the argument be demonftration we muft be prepared to 
admit that a witnefs may be as good as an argument or better 



on probability 

i fhall now proceed to the feveral problems which this fubjeft 
requires confidering firft teftimony alone next argument alone 
and then the two in combination 

problem i there are independent teftimonies to the truth of 
an aflertion of the value y f c one of them being the 
initial teftimony of the mind itfelf which is to form the judg 
ment required the value of the united teftimony 

let fj be i— t c as in page here is a problem of 
the fame clafs as in page the reftridlions are that all the 
teftimonies are right or all wrong the independent chances of 
which are av and atv hence the probabilities are

obferve firft that any numbers proportional to ta a c will 
do as well and if the produfts have a common denominator 
as generally they have the numerators only need be ufed se 
condly the eafieft way of exprefeng the refult is by faymg that it 
is ltvf to tvf for or ttvy to jlv againft 

for inftance let it be in my mind to one againft an afler 
tion that is i bear only the teftimony tot in favour of it let 
four witncfles for whofe accuracy it is to i to i to i 
to i depofe in favour of it want to know how it ought to 
ftand in my mind the teftimonies for and againft are 

jl £ and i i

hence neglefting the common denominator it ought to be 
xxxx to x ix ix ix i or to or to 
for the aflertion 

obferve that in faying the witnefs gives teftimony iay it is 
of no confequence whether it be a queftion of judgment or of 
veracity or of both together i mean that come how it may i 
am fatisfied that when he fays anything it is to i he fays what 
is correal 

an eafy rule for the more common modes of expreflion pre 
fents itfelf thus the combined relative teftimony is the produdl 
of the feparate relative teftimonies thus two witnefles of 
truths to one error and of truths to one error are equivalent 



 on probability 

to one witnefs of or x truths to one error three wit 
nefles of truths to errors are equivalent to one 
witnefs of truths to errors 

a jury of twelve equally truftworthy perfons after conferring 
together agree to an aflertion on which previoufly i had no 
leaning suppofing me fully fatisfied that fuch agreement gives 
 to i for their refult what am i to think of the deliberate 
opinion of any one among them that is of his opinion after he 
has had the advantage of difcuibon with others 

let fjl be the value of fuch teftimony from any one then by 
the queftion 



afc i— tty i or a i— a yioo i 

iay as i to i that is i think inconfiftently if i rely on 
the united verdidl as upon to i unlefs i am prepared to 
think it to or about to for each juror alone 

ofmn equally truftworthy jurors a majority m are for and

which are exaftly as if the majority w— had been all and 
unanimous from the original formula it will appear that two 
equally good teftimonies on oppofite fides produce no effeft on 
the refult 

if then the unanimity of the jury box in this country could 
be confidered as that of deliberate conviftibn we might fay that 
a larger jury with the condition that the majority fliould exceed 
the minority by at leaft would be always as good and often 
better but there are various confiderations which prevent the 
above refult from being applicable the neceffity of being unan 
imous as our law ftands may lower the value of the verdid on 
the other hand a jury of required to find by a majority of 
would generally proceed to a vote before they had put the matter 
to each other with the real defire to gain opinion which the pre 
ffent praftice produces confequently the value of their verdift 
would perhaps be lower than that of the majority only required 
to be unanimous 



on probability 

the theory thus appears to confirm the notion on which we 
often aft that a given excefs of majority over minority is of the 
fame value whatever the numbers in the two may be and this 
might be the cafe if the thing called deliberation in a large body 
were as well adapted to the difcovery of truth as the fame thing 
in a fmaller one the reader muft remember that this teft does 
not compare the one witnefs on his own judgment with a num 
ber after common deliberation but the firft after common deli 
beration with others is compared with the whole 

but in this and all the problems of this chapter the diftinftion 
muft be carefully drawn between the credibility of a circumftance 
at one time and at another for example a witnefs enters with 
id to i in his favour and owing to combination with others the 
refult comes out that it is to i he is in error in the par 
ticular matter on which he gives evidence we cannot believe 
both that it is to i he is right and to i that he is wrong 
what we believe is the latter for the cafe in queftion 

as another inftance fuppofe m independent witneffes of equal 
goodneis t unite in affirming that a certain ball was drawn from 
a lottery of n balls collufion being fuppofed impoffible my 
knowledge of the circumftances of the affirmation here alters the 
problem if n be confiderable it is almoft impoffible that the 
witneffes by independent falfehood or error fliould all pitch on 
the fame wrong ball to find the bias this ought to give me to 
the conclufion that they have told the truth i muft obferve that 
there being — i balls not drawn whichever of thefe any one 
choofes by error the chance of any one of the reft choofing the 
fame is ir— i the probability that all the — i fliall choofe 
the fame is — i hence the odds are as to i— t 
multiplied by the laftnamed expreffion or as — iv to 
 i — £ if n be very great the odds may be enormous for the 
affertion even though tt the credibility of each witnefs may be 
fmall in cafes of ordinary evidence the thing afferted is ufually 
one out of almoft an infinite number of equally poffible affertions 
and the agreement of even two witneffes for when m is two or 
upwards n appears in the formula is certain conviftion if as 
affumed we know the two witneffes to be not in collufion if 
 ir which is as much as to ay that the evidence of each 
witnefs makes a ball no more likely to have been the one drawn 



 on probability 

becaufe he fays it that it was on our mere knowledge that a ball 
had been drawn it turns out i to i for the truth of the affer 
tion juft as it was before the evidence but let tai 
a being any fraftion however fmall that is let each witnefs 
make the aflertion more probable than at firft however little 
then the odds for its truth become 

lay tol lvi— ia 

which odds may be made as great as we pleafe by iifficiently in 
creafing m that is to fay however little each witnefs may be 
good for in real fupport of the aflertion or in making it more 
probable than it is of itfelf a fufficient number of witnefles cer 
tainly independent will give it any degree of credibility what 
ever 

the ftudent of this fubjefl is always ftruck by the frequency 
of the problems in which the fcience confirms an ordinary notion 
of common life or is confirmed by it according to his ftate of 
mind with refpeft to the whole doftrine it is impoflible to fay 
that we have a theory made to explain common phenomena and 
hence affording no reafon for furprife that it does explain them 
the firft principles are too few and two fimple the train of 
deduftion ends in conclufions far too remote i believe hundreds 
of cafes might be cited in which the refults of this theory are 
found already eftabliflied by the common fenfe of mankind in 
many of them the mathematical fciences were not powerful 
enough to give the modes of calculation when the principles of 
the theory were firft digefted 

there are problems however in which we cannot eafily 
come into poflteffion of data on which many will agree the 
fimple queftion of independent witnefles is not one of them 
but the queftion of collufion is one of the difficulties is as 
follows we cannot inftitute independent hypothefes upon the 
goodnefs of the witnefles and the probability of their having con 
ferred upon their evidence they declare expreflly or by im 
plication that they have not done fo if they have there is falfe 
hood in one part of their evidence or which makes the difficulty 
ftill greater there may have been general but as they afltert or 
imply not particular conference they may have been biafled by 



on probability 

each other without knowing how or to what extent the firft 
ftep in one view of the problem is eafily made as follows 

let fjl be the value of the evidence of each witnefs m their 
number n the number of aflertions they have power to choofe 
from all as before let a be the probability that there has been 
particular conference between them there are then four cafes 
to which the problem is reftrifted — i they have conferred and 
agreed to fpeak truth they have not conferred and all fpeak 
truth they have conferred and agreed on a falfehood 
they have not conferred and have all lighted upon the fame falfe 
hood the a priori probabilities of thefe four cafes are 



 i— mi— at 



and the odds that they fpeak the truth fuppofing n o great that 
we may rejeft the fourth cafe are a to ai— tc now 
comes the praftical difficulty of this queftion — how are x and 
fjl to be conneled every cafe which is worth examining fup 
pofes that the greater the chance of there having been particular 
conference the lefe is the witnefs worth from that very circum 
ftance for it is to be remembered that we are not generally 
able to give the witnefs a character wholly independent of his 
evidence in the cafe before us in hiftorical queftions for in 
ftance it frequently happens that we have nothing but the wit 
neffes to try the cafe by and nothing but the cafe to try the 
witnefles by a very common occurrence is this — that a cafe 
is one in which no one would throw any doubt upon the wit 
nefles except for fuipicion of conference and juft as much doubt 
as there is fuipicion of conference this makes ai— a and 
gives i —a ix for the odds in favour of the aflfertion on this 
fuppofition it follows that whenever the chances are againft all 
the witnefltes having conferred particularly their number if great 
enough ought to give any degree of credibility to the aflirtion 

• this gives rife to two great tendencies which very nearly divide the 
world among them some fettle the cafe in their own minds and then try 
the witnefles fome fettle the witnefles and then try the cafe not a few 
bring their fecond refult back again to juftify their firft aflumption when 
there are two unknown quantities with only one equation it is eafy for thofe 
who will aflume either to find the other but the difiiculty is to find the 
moft probable value of both 



 on probability 

problem let there be any number of different affertions of 
which one muft be true and only one or of which one may be 
true and not more than one or of which any given number 
may be true but not more required the probability of any one 
poieble cafe 

the folution of all thefe varieties depends on one principle 
explained in page requiring the previous probabilities of all 
the confident cafes to be compared as an inftance fuppofe 
four affertions abcd and fuppofe tvfcr to be the probabi 
lities from teftimony for each of them if either of them have 
feveral teftimonies their united force muft be afcertained by the 
laft problem firft let it be that one of them muft be true 
and one only the probabilities in favour of abcd are in 
the proportion of atvv vtyr jtvv and afjuv either of 
thefe divided by the fum of all reprefents the probability of its 
cafe secondly let it be that one of them only can be true and 
all may be falfe put on the fifth quantity avj 
in which all are falfe for example there are four diftin£l 
affertions not more than one of which can be true the fepa 
rate evidences for thefe four affertions give them the probabili 
ties f tr and there is a certain affertion which is true if 
either of the firft three be true required the probability of that 
affertion here neglefting the common denominator which 
is xxx in every cafe the probabilities of the feveral 
affertions and that of all being falfe are as 
 and or as and 
 the odds for one of the firft three cafes againft one of 
the other two are to or as to 
 or it is to againft the truth of the affertion 

suppofe the condition were that two of the affertions but not 
more may be truej and that one muft be true then the pof 
fible cafes meaning by an accent that the affertion is not true 
are abcd bacd cabd dabc abcd acbd 
adbc bcad bdac cdab confequently the pro 
babilities of thefe cafes are in the proportion of favpa vfjpff 
pfvcr c and the odds in favour of fay a being true are as 
the fum of all the terms which contain t to the fum of thofe 
which contain t 

when we wifh to fignify that no evidence is offered either for 



on probability 

or againft one of the affertions we muft put it down as having 
the teftimony to put down o in the place of would be to 
make an infallible witnefs declare that it is not true suppofe 
there are four affertions one of which muft be true and one 
only evidence of goodnefs is offered for the firft and none 
either way for the others required the probability of the firft 
the probabilities of the four affertions are in the proportion of 
 and and it is to for the 
firft or to againft it 

problem arguments being fuppofed logically good and the 
probabilities of their proving their conclufions that is of all 
their premifes being true being called their validities let there 
be a conclufion for which a number of arguments are prefented 
of validities a f c required the probability that the con 
clufion is proved 

this problem differs from thofe which precede in a material 
point teftimonies are all true together or all falfe together 
but one of the arguments may be perfeftly found though all the 
reft be prepofterous the queftion then is what is the chance 
that one or more of the arguments proves its conclufion that 
all fliall fail the probability is av that all fliall not fail the 
probability is i— av accordingly if we fuppofe n equal 
arguments each of validity a the probability that the conclufion 
is proved is i — i — and as in page j if the odds againft 
each argument be to i then the number of fuch arguments 
being as much as k the conclufion is rendered as likely as not 

but are we really to believe having arguments againft the 
validity of each of which it is to i that feven fuch arguments 
make the conclufion about as likely to be true as not if fuch 
be the cafe the theory ufually fo accordant with common notions 
is ftrangely at variance with them this point will require fome 
further confideration 

in this problem i confider only argument and not teftimony 
which neverthelefs cannot be finally excluded fee page 
if the conclufion be one on which our minds are wholly un 
biaffed to begin with it may feem that we have no efcape from 
the preceding refult and to it we muft oppofe for confidera 
tion at leaft the common opinion of mankind that ftrong argu 
ments are the prefumption of truth weak arguments of falfehood 



 on probability 

if a controverfialift were to bring forward a hundred arguments 
and if his opponent were fo far to anfwer them as to make it ten 
to one againft each there can be no doubt that the latter would 
be confidered as having fairly contradifted the former 

we muft not forget that argument in a great many cafes in 
volves and produces the effel of teftimony and this in an eafily 
explicable and perfectly juftifiable manner if i were to pick up 
a bit of paper in the ftreets on which an argument is written 
for a conclufion on which i have no previous opinion and by an 
unknown writer and if i could fay that that argument left on 
my mind the impreieon of ten to one againft its validity i might 
be prepared to allow it to ftand as giving rr of probability and 
upon that fuppofition to combine it with my previous opinion 
as in the next problem but fuppofe it is on a queftion of 
phyfics and newton is the propofer of it and that it is his only 
argument and therefore i conclude his beft the cafe is now 
entirely altered pofebly the conclufion is one on which the 
following argument would have great probability if this con 
clufion were true it could be proved if it could be proved 
newton could have proved it therefore if it were true 
newton could have proved it but newton cannot prove it 
therefore it is not true if the cafe be fuch that the two pre 
mifes of this laft argument have each to i for it or j then 
though the original argument give iv for the conclufion the mere 
circumftance of newton bringing this argument as his beft is 
againft it if newton at the fame time declare his belief in the 
conclufion we have on one fide his argument and his authority 
on the other fide the argument arifing from his being reduced 
to fuch an argument 

that fuch confideratipns have weight we know and that 
they ought to have weight we may eafily fee it is of courfe 
dependent upon the particular conclufion what weight ftiall be 
attached to the aflfertion if this conclufion were true it could 
be proved the courts of law conftantly aft upon this princi 
ple they confider very juftly i think that evidence however 
good it may be is much lowered by not being die beft evidence 
that could be brought forward if a man be alive and capable 
of being produced with fufficient eafe they will not take any 
number of good witnefles to the faft of his having been very 



on probability 

recently alive in enumerating the arguments then for or 
againft a propofition thofe muft be included if any which arife 
out of the nature mode of produ£lion or producers of any 
among them and until this has been properly done we are 
not in a condition to apply the methods of the prefent chapter 

problem a conclufion and its contradiftion being produced 
one or the other of which muft be true and arguments being 
produced on both fides required the probability that the conclu 
fion is proved difproved e the contradiction proved or left 
neither proved nor difproved 

colleft all the arguments for the conclufion as in the laft 
problem and let a be the probability that one or more of them 
prove the conclufion similarly let b be the probability that one 
or more of the oppofite arguments prove the contradiction both 
thefe cafes cannot be true though both may be falfe the pro 
babilities of the different cafes are thus derived either the 
conclufion is proved and the contradiftion not proved or the 
conclufion not proved and the contradi£lion proved or both are 
left unproved the probabilities for thefe cafes are as i— i 
b i — and i — tf i j and the probability that the conclufion 
is proved is i— i divided by the fum of the three and fo on 
the fraftion i— tfi— i divided by this fum may be called the 
inconclujivenefs of the combined arguments the manner in 
which this inconclufivenefs is to be diftributed between the hypo 
thefis of the truth and falfehood of the conclufion muft depend 
upon teftimony in the complete fenfe of the word 

the predominance of one fide or the other as far as argu 
ments only are concerned depends on which is the greateft 
i— i or ii— or fimply on which is the greateft a or b 
if the arguments on both fides be very ftrong or a and b both very 
near to unity then though i— a and ai— are both fmall 
yet i— i— i is very fmall compared with either the ratio 
of i— i to bia on which the degree of predominance de 
pends may confiftently with this fuppofitipn be anything what 
ever but we cannot pretend that when oppofite fides are thus 
both nearly demonftrated the mind can take cognizance of the 
predominance which depends upon the ratio of the fmall and 
imperceptible defefts from abfolute certainty the neceflary 
confequence is that the arguments are evenly balanced and are 



 on probability 

as if they were equal there is no fenfible notion of predominance 
this is the ftate to which moft well conduced oppofitions of 
argument bring a good many of their followers they are fairly 
outwitted by both fides and unable to anfwer either and the 
conclufion to which they come is determined by their own pre 
vious impreflions and by the authorities to which they attach 
moft weight and thefe are of courfe thofe which favour their 
own previoufly adopted fide of the queftion 

when no argument is produced on one fide of the queftion 
the cafe is very different from the cafe of the preceding problems 
in which no teftimony is produced here the queftion is has 
the conclufion been proved or not proved and when no argu 
ment is produced we are certain it has not been proved ac 
cordingly if no argument were urged for the contradiftion we 
fhould have i— ii or io 

if in the preceding problem the two fides of the queftion be 
not contradiftions but fubcontradiftions of which neither need 
be true but both cannot be the problem is folved in the fame 
way for the cafes are juft the fame but we may introduce a 
diftinftion which the former cafe would not admit when one 
muft be true every argument againft one is of equal force for 
the other which is not the cafe when neither need be true 
let there then be arguments for the firft conclufion and againft 
it and let a and p be the probabilities that one or more of the 
arguments for prove it or againft difprove it let b and q be 
the fimilar probabilities for the fecond conclufion then there 
are thefe cafes — i the arguments or fome of them for the 
firft are valid againft it invalid and thok for the fecond are 
invalid it matters nothing whether thofe agalnjl the fecond be 
valid or invalid the arguments for the firft are invalid 
thofe for the fecond valid and againft it invalid the argu 
ments againft the firft are valid and thofe for it invalid the 
arguments againft the fecond are valid and thofe for it invalid 
 all the arguments are invalid accordingly the probabilities 
that the firft is proved that it is difproved that the fecond is 
proved that it is difproved and that neither of the two is proved 
nor difproved are in the proportion of i— i— i— y 
ii i and iiiiy 

problem given both teftimony and argument to both fides 



on probability 

of a con tradition one fide of which muft be true required the 
probability of the truth of each fide 

this is the moft important of our cafes as reprefenting all 
ordinary controverfy coueft all the teftimonies and let their 
united force for the firft fide be and from the nature of this 
cafe i — for the other fide let a and b be the probabilities 
that the firft fide and the fecond fide are proved by one or more 
of the arguments in their favour now obferve that for the 
truth or either fide it is not efltential that the argument for it 
fhould be valid but only that the argument againft it fhould be 
invalid accordingly the probabilities of the two fides are in 
the proportion of i— i and i— ai— and the probabili 
ties of the two fides are reprefented by 



firft let there be no teftimony either way we muft then have 
yitji— a confequently thefe probabilities are as i — b to 
i — let no argument have been offered for the fecond fide 
or let io then we have i to i— for the odds or 
— for the probability of the firft fide being true it has 
been ufual to fay that if an argument be prefented of which the 
probability is a the truth of the conclufion has alfo the probabi 
lity a probably the above was the cafe intended as to teftimony 
c and the probability fhould then have been 

or i — 

— a — a 

which is always greater than a or as we might expe£l the 
poffibility of the conclufion being true though the argument 
fhould be invalid always adds fomething to the probability of its 
being true moreover ir— is always greater than i or 
any argument however weak adds fomething to the force of 
the previous probability the fame thing is true in every cafe 
suppofe a new argument to be produced for the firft fide of the 
force k the effeft upon the formula is to change i— into 
i— i— i and the odds in favour of the conclufion are in 
creafed in the proportion of i to i— but this is to be under 



o on probability 

ffood ftriflly in the fenfe defcribed in page namely we are 
to fuppofe that the newly produced argument is fingle that is 
does not by the circumftances of its produftion caufe itfelf to be 
accompanied by an argument for the fecond fide or againft the 
firft if this laft fliould happen and the argument thus created 
for the fecond fide have the force the odds are altered in the 
proportion of i — to i — 

from the above it appears that oppofite arguments of the 
force a and b are exaftly equivalent to a teftimony the odds for 
the truth of which are as i — i to i — tf thus fuppofe we have 
for a conclufion witneffes whofe teftimonies are worth f 
t arguments for of the feveral forces tti and arguments 
againft of the forces § tt t writing numerators only we put 
down 

for i 

againft i i i 

hence it is i to i i i i or 

 to i for the conclufion 

an argument we fhould infer beforehand is better than a 
teftimony of the fame force for the failure of the argument is 
nothing againft the conclufion but the failure of the teftimony is 
its overthrow so fays the formula alfo the introduftion of a 
teftimony of the value not before received alters the exifting 
odds in the proportion of to i—kx but the introduftion of an 
argument of the fame force alters them in the greater proportion 
of i to i— thus the introduction of the teftimony of a 
perfon who is as often wrong as right alters the odds in the 
proportion of i to i or does not alter them at all but the intro 
duftion of an argument which is as likely as not to prove the 
conclufion alters them in the proportion of i to — or of 
 to i 

are we not in the habit unconfcioufly of recognizing fome 
fuch diftinftion do we not give much more weight to argu 
ment than to teftimony i fufpe the anfwer ftiould be in the 
affirmative that an argument of to i does convince us much 
more than a teftimony of to i i fufpeft we ftiow it not in 
numerical appreciation of courfe but in liftening to and allow 



on probability 

ing weight to arguments when we fhould refufe teftimony of 
the fame charafter 

it may be doubted however whether we have much fcope 
for experiment on the lower degrees either of teftimony or argu 
ment perhaps it is not often we meet a witnefs whether as 
bearing teftimony of veracity to a faft or of judgment to a con 
clufion whofe evidence is as low as and the fame perhaps of 
an argument 

i have fpoken in the previous part of this chapter of the 
rejection of authority that is of teftimony authority being only 
high teftimony let us now examine by the formula and fee 
what it amounts to let a be the probability that the argument 
proves its conclufion and let us therefore perlift in faying that 
a is the probability for the truth of the conclufion in the for 
mula b beingo let x be made ri it will be found that 
the probability for the conclufion x divided by tt i — iti — 
comes out a as required confequently in the cafe of a fingle 
argument the total rejeftion as it would be thought of all tefti 
mony is really equivalent to accompanying every argument by a 
teftimony lefs than depending upon its own force it is to 
declare that by the laws of thought an argument of is of its 
own nature accompanied by a witnefs of iv one of by a wit 
nefs of f and fo on this is clearly not what was meant nor 
i fuppofe can it be meant that we are arbitrarily to ftart with the 
teftimony i and to reduce our own evidence and that of all 
others to the fame if there be any fenfe in which the rejeftion 
of authority is defenfible it muft be when we are required to 
proceed as if we were in perfeft ignorance what the value of the 
authority is we cannot fuppofe it to be as likely to have one value 
as another suppofe for inftance that the arguments have un 
known propofers we cannot treat their authorities as if they were 
juft as likely to be exceffively high or low as to be very near 
to none at all the more rational fuppofition is that the autho 
rity fhould be more likely to be fmall than great as likely to be 
againft as for and very unlikely to be exceisvely great either for 
or againft i cannot here enter into the mode in which fuch an 
hypothefis can be exprefled or ufed but the refult of the finipleft 
formula which fatisfies the above conditions is as follows — 
let ri— iri— b and a meaning as above j then the 



o on probability 

probability that the conclufion is true which has a for the 
validity of its argument c is 

rr— rh r rlogr tr— i 

where logr means the naperian logarithm rds of the 
common logarithm will be near enough for the prefent purpofe 
if for inftance r which on the fuppofition of no previous 
balance of teftimony would give to i for the conclufion the 
formula juft written gives • or to fomething lefs 
than to i 

in the cafe firft difcuffed in page it may be thought that 
the weaknefs of a propofed argument from one who fliould have 
brought a better if there had been one may be confidered as a 
tejiimony againft the conclufion rather than an argument sup 
pofe his argument for inftance to have only the probability 
he tells us then that after he has done his beft it is to i 
againft the propofition being proved if we are very confident 
that it could be proved if true and that he could do it if any 
one he comes before us as a teftimony of to i againft the 
truth of the conclufion or very nearly fo if we take then all 
that his argument wants of demonftration as fo much evidence 
from him againft the conclufion this amounts to fuppofing that 
a being the validity of his argument a is alfo his teftimony for 
the conclufion and i — that againft it if there be only argu 
ment for and none againft and if our minds be previoufly unbi 
aflid we reprefent this cafe by putting a iox jl n the formula 
and the odds for the conclufion are then as to i— on 
this fuppofition which i incline to think well worthy of attention 
we fliould not confider an unoppofed argument from an acute 
reafbner as giving the conclufion to be as likely as not unlefi 
ai—ay or a little more than j were it not for 
our peculiar introduction of teftimony then the conclufion being 
as likely as not to begin with an argument which has any pro 
bability of proving it would have made it more likely than not 
as before feen 

but that the introduced teftimony fliould be exaftly as above 
is a mere fuppofition if it were a mathematical propofition 
for inftance and euler were to declare himfelf unable to give 
more than a probability of proof i for one fliould confider him 



on probability 

as giving a much higher rate of teftimony againft the truth of 
the aitertion than is flippofed in the preceding but all this has 
reference to the queftion how to meafure teftimonies and va 
lidities in particular cafes which is quite a diftina thing from 
the inveftigation of the way to ufe them when meafiued 

in cafes in which the number of arguments is multiplied it 
generally happens that they ftand or fall together in parcels 
namely that the feme lure which makes one invalid neceffarily 
makes others invalid in this cafe independent arguments muft 
be feledled and the probabilities for them alone employed 

we fee in this problem an illuftradon of the commonly ob 
ferved refult that the feme argument produces very different 
final conclufions in two different minds and this when fb far as 
can be judged both are difpofed to give the feme probabilities to 
the feveral premifes of the argument the initial odds come 
how they may or to i — fhould be altered by the arguments 
in the proportion of i— i to i— accordingly b and a being 
the fame to both parties their belief in the conclufion may have 
any kind of difference if x be not the feme thing to both 

problem given an affertion a which has the probability 
a what does that probability become when it is made known 
that there is the probability m that b is a neceffary confequence 
of a b having the probability b and what does the probabi 
lity of b then become 

firfl let a and b not be inconfiflent the cafes are now as 
follows with reipedl to a either a is true and it is not true 
that both the connexion exifls and b is falfe or a is falfe this 
is much too concife a flatement for the beginner except when it 
is fuppofed left to him to verify it by collecting all the cafes the 
odds for the truth of a either as above or by the collection 
are tfi— i— i to i— as to b either b is true or bis 
falfe and it is not true that a and the connexion are both true 
accordingly the odds for b are as to i— ii— itf 

the reader mufl remember that when b neceffarily follows 
from a b mufl be true when a is true but may be true when 
a is falfe while a mufl be felfe when b is falfe and now we 
fee that a propofition is not neceffarily unlikely becaufe it is very 
likely to lead to an incredibility or even to an abfolute impoffi 
bility let io or let b be impoffible then the odds for a 

p 



 on probability 

are as i— w to i— say that it is to i that the connec 
tion exifts then thefe odds are as a to if a be 
greater than fij ftiu a remains more likely than not even when 
it is to i that it leads to the abfurdity b 

secondly let a and b be inconliftent fo that both cannot be 
true either then a is true b falfe and the connexion does 
not exift or a is falfe the odds for a are then s ai—b 
i— w to i— tf with refpeft to b either b is true and a is 
falfe or b is falfe and a and the connexion are not both true 
the odds for b are then as bi—a to i— i— 
 among the early fophifms with which the greeks tried the 
power of logic as a formal mode of detefting fallacies was the 
conftruision of what we may cisl fuicidal propofitions affertions 
the truth of which would be their own felfehood if a man 
fhould fay i lie he fpeaks neithef truth nor falfehood for if 
he fay true he lies and if he lie he fpeaks truth such a fpeech 
cannot be interpreted again the cretan epimenides faid that 
all the cretans were incredible liars is he to be believed or not 
if we believe him we muft he being a cretan difbelieve him 
some ftated it thus — if we believe him then the cretans are 
liars and we fhould not believe him then there is no evidence 
againft the cretans or we may believe him fo that the evidence 
againft the cretans revives c c c refer fuch a propo 
rtion to the theory of probabilities and the difficulty immediately 
difappears whatever the credit of epimenides as a witne 
may be that is whatever upon his word the odds may be for his

chapter xi 

on induction 

the theory of what is now called indusfion muft occupy a 
large fpace in every work which profeffes to treat of the 
matter of arguments but there is not much to fay upon the gen 
uine meaning of the word in any fyftem of formal logic and that 
little would be lefs if it were not for the miftaken oppofition 
which it has long been cuftomary to confider as exifting between 
the induftive procefs and the reft of our fubjeft 

by induftion lraywyii is meant the inference of a univerfal 
propofition by the feparate inference of all the particulars of 
which it is compofed whether thefe particulars defcend fo low 
as fingle inftances or not thus if x be a name which includes 
pqr fo that every thing which is x muft be one of the 
three then if it be fhown feparately that every p is y and that 
every q is y and that every r is y it follows that every x 
is y and this laft is faid to be proved by indudion thus 
chapter vi 

xpqrpy qyryxy 

is an induftive procefs in form it may be reduced as in page 
 to one ordinary fyuogifm 

complete induction is demonftration and ftrilly fyuogiftic in 
its charafter in the preceding procefs we have yp yq yr 
which give ypqr and xpqr is pqrx whence yx or x y 
it is a queftion of names that is it depends upon the exiftence 
or nonexiftence of names whether a complete induction fliall 
preferve that form or lofe it in the appearance of a barbara fyuo 
gifm formed by help of the conjunftive poftulate of chapter vi 

but when the number of fpecies or inftances contained under 
a name x is above enumeration and it is therefore practically 
impoffible to couedl and examine all the cafes the final induc 
tion that is the ftatement of a univerfal from its particulars 
becomes impofhble except as a probabe astement unlefs it 
hould happen that we can deteft fbme law connefting the fpe 
cies or inftances by which the refult when obtained as to a 
certain number may be inferred as to the reft 



 on indusiion 

this laft named kind of induifion by connexion is common 
enough in mathematics but can hardly occur in any other kind 
of knowledge in an innumerable feries of propofitions repre 
fented by pippp c it may and does happen that means 
will exift of fhowing that when any confecutive number fuppofe 
three of them are true the next muft be true when this 
happens a formal indu£lion may be made as bon as the three 
firft are eftablifhed for by the law of connexion pip and p 
eftablifh p but p and p eftablifh p and then pp 
and p eftablifh pg j and fo on ad infinitum it is to be obferved 
that this is really indusfion there is no way in this procefs of 
compelling an opponent to admit the truth of poo without 
forcing him if he decline to admit it otherwife through all the 
previous cafes 

as an eafy inftance obferve the proof that the fquare of any 
number is equal to the fum of as many confecutive odd numbers 
beginning with unity as there are units in that number as ken 
in 

x 

take any number n and write n m reprefenting a unit by 
a dot in rank and file to enlarge this figure into i is 
we muft place n more dots at each of two adjacent fides and 
one more at the corner so that the quare of n is turned into 
the fquare of by adding which is the ith odd 
number thus x is turned into loi x loi by adding 
the loift odd number or if then the theorem alleged be 
true of x it is therefore true of x but it is 
true of the firft number i x i being i therefore it is true of the 
fecond or x therefore it is true of the third or 
x andfoon 

but when we can neither examine every cafe nor frame a 
method of connefting one cafe with another no abfolutely de 
monftrative induftion can exift that which is ufually called by 
the name is the declaration of a univerfal truth from the enumer 
ation of fome particulars being the affumption that the unex 
amined particulars will agree with thofe which have been ex 
amined in every point in which thofe which have been examined 
agree with one another the refult thus obtained is one of 



on induslion 

probability and though a moral certainty or an unimpcachably 
high degree of probability can eafily be obtained and aftually is 
obtained and though moft of our conclufions with refpeft to the 
external world are really thus obtained yet it is an error to put 
the refultof fuch an induction in the fame clafs with that of a de 
monftration there is no objeftion whatever to any one faying 
that the former refults are to his mind more certain than thofe of 

• 

the latter the fa may be that they are fo the difference 
between neceffary and contingent propofitions lies in the quali 
ties from which they receive thofe adjeftives more than in 
difference of credibility i know that a ftone will fall to the 
ground when let go and i know that a fquare number muji be 
equal to the fum of the odd numbers as above and though 
when i flop to think i do become fenfible of more affurance for 
the fecbnd than for the firft yet it is only on reflexion that i 
can diftinguifh the certainty from that which is fo near to it 

the rule of probability of a pure indusfion is eafily given 
suppofing the fimple queftion to be whether x is or is not y 
there being no previous circumftances whatfoever to make us 
think that any one x is more likely than not to be y or left 
likely than not thefe are the circumftances of what i call a 
pure induction to begin with it is i to that the firft x ex 
amined fliall be a y if this be done andxi be a y then it is 
 to i that xj hall be a y fhould it fo happen then it is to 

i that x hall be a y generally when the firft m xs have 
all been examined and all turn out to be ys it is w to i 
that the i ith x fliall be a y 

the fimplicity of this rule muft not lead the ftudent to fuppofe 
he can find a fimple reafon for it let xs have been exam 
ined and found to be ys what do we affert when we fay it is 

i i to i that the i ith x fliall be a y we aflert that if an in 
finite number of urns were couefted each having white balls and 
black balls in infinite number but in a definite ratio and fo that 
every poffible ratio of white balls to black ones occurs once and 
if every poffible way of drawing eleven balls the firft ten of 
which are white were felefted and put afide then of thofe put 
afide there are eleven in which the eleventh ball is white for 
one in which the eleventh ball is black the reader will find 
fome difficulty in forming a diftinft conception of this and of 



 o induction 

courfe will find it impoffible to have any axiomatic perception of 
the truth or felfefiood of the refult 

it may be worth while to fhow that a fuppofidon making fome 
degree of approach to the preceding circumftances will give fome 
approach to the refult firft in lieu of an infinite number of 
balls in each box which is fuppofed only that withdrawal of a 
definite number may not alter the ratio let each ball drawn be 
put back again which will anfwer the fame purpofe let there 
be only ten urns with ten balls in each of which let the firft 
have one white the fecond two white c and the laft all white 
the number of ways of drawing eleven white balls fucceffively 
out of any one urn is the eleventh power of the number of white 
balls in the urn that of drawing ten white balls followed by one 
black one is the tenth power of the number of white balls mul 
tiplied by the number of black ones if we were to put together 
all the firft and then all the fecond we fhould find about i 
times as many ways of arriving at the firft refult ten white fol 
lowed by a white as the fecond ten white followed by a black 
but if we now increafed the number of urns and took a hundred 
having one two c white balls we fhould find inftead of 
a number much nearer to and o on 

accordingly when without any previoufly formed bias we 
find that m xs fucceffively examined are each of them a y we 
ought then to believe it to be w to i that the next or 
 ith x will be a y and further a being a fradion lefs 
than unity we have a right to fay there is the probability i — 
that the xs make up the fraftion a or more of the ys or 
thus — if the fraftion a be fay and if mhe then if the 
 firft xs be all ys the probability that or more of the xs 
are ys is juft that of drawing one or more black balls in 
drawings from an urn in which of the balls are always white 

if for example the firft xs were all ys it would be 
found to be to i that per cent at leaft of all the xs 
are ys 

if as before the firft m xs obferved have all been ys and we 
afk what probability thence and thence only arifes that the next 
n xs examined fliall all be ys the anfwer is that the odds in fit 
vour of it are i i to and againft it n to mi no induc 
tion then however extenfive can by itfelf afford much probability 



on indubion 

to a univerfal concluiion if the number of inftances to be exam 
ined be very great compared with thofe which have been exam 
ined if inftances have been examined and remain it 
is to loi againft all the thoufand being as the hundred 

this refult is at variance with all our notions and yet it is 
demonftrably as rational as any other refult of the theory the 
truth is that our notions are not wholly formed on what i have 
called the pure indusfion in this it is fuppofed that we know no 
reafbn to judge except the mere mode of occurrence of the in 
duced inftances accordingly the probabilities fliown by the 
above rules are merely minima which may be augmented by 
other fources of knowledge for inftance the ftrong belief 
founded upon the moft extenfive previous induftion that pheno 
mena are regulated by uniform laws makes the firft inftance of a 
new cafe by itfelf furnifli as ftrong a prefiimption as many in 
ftances would do independently of fuch belief and reafon for it 

with this however i have nothing farther to do except to 
obferve that in the language of many induction is ufed in a fenfe 
very different from its original and logical one it is made to 
mean not the coueftion of a univerfal from particulars but the 
mode of arrival at a common caufe for varied but fimilar phe 
nomena a great part of what is thus called induftion confifts 
in difcovery of differences not refemblances under this confufed 
ufe of language the ufual theory is introduced namely that 
ariftotle was oppofed to all induftion that bacon was oppofed 
to every thing elfe that the whole world up to the time of bacon 
followed ariftotle that the former was the firft who ftiowed the 
way to oppofe the latter that each had a logic of his own c 
c the whole of this account abounds with miftatements 
the admitted and fufficiently ftriking difference between the 
philofophy of modern and ancient times in all natural and mate 
rial branches of inquiry is not fo eafily explained as by choofing 
two men one to bear all the blame the other all the credit nor 
are copernicus gilbert tycho brahe galileo and the other 
predeceftors of the novum organum deftined to be always de 
prived of their proper rank 

what is now called induction meaning the difcovery of laws 
from inftances and higher laws from lower ones is beyond the 
province of formal logic its inftruments are induftion properly 



 on industion 

o called reparation of apparently related but xeally diftind par 
ticulars the negledl of which was far more hurtful to the old 
philofophy than a neglefl of induflion proper would have been 
even had it exifted mathematical deduftion ordinary logic c 
c c it is the ufe of the whole box of tools and it would 
be as abfurd to attempt it here as to append a chapter on car 
pentry to a defcription of the mode of cutting the teeth of a few 
 the proceffes of ariftotle and of bacon are equally thofe which 
we are in the habit of performing every day of our lives but 
fome perform them well and fome ill it is extraordinary that 
there fhould be fuch divifion of opinion on the queftion whether 
a careful analyfis of them and ftudy of the parts into which they 
decompofe is of any ufe towards performing them well on 
this point and on the charafter of bacons office in philofophy 
a living writer to whom i fhould think it likely that many yet 
unborn would owe their firfl notions of bacons writings ex 
preftes himfelf in a manner which i quote and comment on at 
length as the befl expofition i can find of a clafs of opinions 
which is very prevalent and i fully believe to the prejudice of 
fober thought and accurate knowledge 



the vulgar notion about bacon we take to be this that he invented a 
new method of arriving at truth which method is called indutiony and that 
he detected fome llacy in the fyllogiftic reafoning which had been in vogue 
before his time this notion is about as well founded as that of the people 
who in the middle ages imagined that virgil was a great conjuror many 
who are far too well informed to talk fuch extravagant nonfenfe entertain 
what we think incorrel notions as to what bacon really effe£ied in this 
matter 

the indutive method has been praufed ever ince the beginning of the 
world by every human being it is conftantly pralifed by the moft igno 
rant clown by the moft thoughtlefs fchoolboy by the very child at the 
breaft that method leads the clown to the conclufion that if he fows 
barley he hall not reap wheat by that method a fchoolboy learns that a 
cloudy day is the beft for catching trout the vry infant we imagine is 
led by indution to expe£l milk from hb mother or nurfe and none from 
his father 

not only is it not true that bacon invented the indu£live method j but 
it is not true that he was the firft perfon who corretiy analyfed that method 
and explained its ufes ariftotle had long before pointed out the abiurdity 
of fuppofing that fyllogiftic reafoning could ever condul men to the diico 
very of any new principle had ihown that fuch difcoveries muft be made by 



on industton 



lnduuon and by induction alone and had given the hiftory of the induve 
proce concifely indeed but with great perfpicuity and precifion 

again we are not inclined to afcribe much pralical value to that analy 
£s of the indutive method which bacon has given in the fecond book of 
the novum organum it is indeed an elaborate and correal analyfis but 
it is an analyiis of that which we are all doing from morning to night and 
which we continue to do even in our dreams a plain man iinds his fto 
mach out of order he never heard lord bacons name but he proceeds 
in the ftrileft conformity with the rules laid down in the fecond book of 
the novum organum and fatisfies himfelf that minced pies have done the 
mifchief i eat minced pies on monday and wednefday and i was kept 
awake by indigeftion all night this is the comparentia ad intellesum in 
jiantiarum convenientium i did not eat any on tuefday and friday and 
i was quite well this is the comparentia injiantiarum in proximo qua 
natura daiaprivantur i ate very fparingly of them on sunday and was 
very lightly indifpofed in the evening but on chriftmasday i almoft 
dined on them and was fo ill that i was in great danger this is the 
comparentia jnftantiarum fecundum magis et minus it cannot have been 
the brandy which i took with them for i have drunk brandy daily for 
years without being the worfe for it this is the rejesio naturarum our 
invalid then proceeds to what is termed by bacon the findemiatio and pro 
nounces that minced pies do not agree with him 

we repeat that we diipute neither the ingenuity noi the accuracy of the 
theory contained in the fecond book of the novum organum but we think 
that bacon greatly overrated its utility we conceive that the indulive 
procefs like many other proceffes is not likely to be better performed 
merely becaufe men know how they perform it william tell would not 
have been one whit more likely to cleave the apple if he had known that 
his arrow would defcribe a parabola under the influence of the attraction of 
the earth captain barclay would not have been more likely to walk a 
thoufand miles in a thoufand hours if he had known the place and name of 
every mufcle in his legs monfieur jourdain probably did not pronounce 
d and f more correuy after he had been apprifed that d is pronounced 
by touching the teeth with the end of the tongue and f by putting the 
upper teeth on the lower lip we cannot perceive that the ftudy of gram 
mar makes the fmalleft difference in the fpeech of people who have always 
lived in good fociety not one londoner in ten thoufand can lay down 
the proper rules for the ufe of vjiu xajhau yet not one londoner in a 
million ever mifplaces his vnu xajhau dr robertibn could undoubtedly 
have written a luminous differtation on the ufe of thefe words yet even in 
his lateft work he fometimes mifplaced them ludicroufly no man ufes 
figures of fpeech with more propriety becaufe he knows that one figure of 
fpeech is called a metonymy and another a fynecdoche a drayman in a 
paflion calls out you are a pretty fellow without fufpeling that he is 
uttering irony and that irony is one of the four primary tropes the old 
fyftems of rhetoric were never regarded by the moil experienced and dia 
ceming judges as of any ufe for the purpofe of forming an orator ego

not know what an ignoratio elenchi is has no difficulty in expofing it when

contributed to the edinburgh review by thomas babington macaulay 

this brilliant paflage has i have no doubt appeared to many 
completely decifive of the queftion which it affirms and as fo 
often happens in like cafes there is a certain exaggeration againft 
which it is of truth it is good againft thofe who confound 
analyfis and recombination of exifting materials with introduftion 
of them and who might profefs to fee in agriculture fomething 
which would have benefited mankind though plants and animals 
had not been natural produfts of the foil but i now proceed 
to examine it againft thofe who affirm that ariftotle and bacon 
are of no ufe and who very frequently fall into the common 
logical fallacy of fuppofing that their cafe is proved as foon as it 
is made out that they are not of all the ufe which mr macau 
lay himfelf has done except as againft the exaggerators aforeid 

we reafon induftively from morning till night and even in 
our dreams true and how badly we often do it particularly 
in fleep a plain man is then produced to reafon on bacons 
principles and mr macaulay has imitated a plain man better 
than he intended by making him do it wrongly look over 
the indu£lion and it will appear that the cafe is not made out 
an exclufion is wanting it may have been the mixture of minced 
pies and brandy which did the mifchief the plain man fhould 
have trid minced pies without brandy but he had drunk the 
latter daily for years and it never ftruck him this is precifely 
one of the points in which we are moft apt to deceive ourfelves 
and for which we moft need to have rccourfe to the complete 
nefs of a fyftem of rules j fomething is left taken for granted 
the things of courfe our daily habits are neglected in the 
confideration of anything of a lefs ufual character the plain man 
left off the minced pies upon trial but not the brandy chrift

but even if this omiffion had been fupplied and the refult found 
to confirm the conclufion yet the plain man has flopped where 
the plain man frequently does flop at what bacon calls the 
vindemiatio prima the rudiments of interpretation gomplete 
nefs is feldom anything but ftudy and fyflem philofophy ought 
to bring him to the refult that daily brandy has made that fpirit 
ceafe to give the ftimulus which were its ufe only occafiondl 
would enable his flomach to bear an unufually rich diet for a 
fhorttime our plain friend is precifely in the pofition of a 
bankrupt who curfes the times on reafbning flrily baconian as 
far as it goes and forgets that a cafual tightnefs in the money 
market would never have upfet him if it had not been for the 
previous years of extravagant living and rafli fpeculation 

but there are many proceffes which are not better performed 
becaufe men know how they perform them mr macaulay 
here means becaufe men know the laws of that part of the 
procefs which nature does for them that men fhould not 
know better how to perform for knowing how they perform 
is almoft a contradiftion in terms william tell knew how to 
hoot all the better for knowing which end of the arrow he was 
accuftomed to fit to the ftring had he wanted this knowledge 
his chance of cleaving the apple would have been much dimi 
niflied but he would not have been improved by knowing 
that his arrow defcribed a parabola true becaufe it did not do 
fo the centre of gravity of the arrow would defcribe a para 
bola if it were not for the refiftance of the air or fomething to 
near it as to be undiftinguiihable but taking the defeription 
as roughly correft william tell did know induftively that the 
arrow defcribes a curve concave to the earth and had made 
thoufands of experiments in connexion of the two ends of that 
curve which were all that he was concerned with it is no ar 
gument againfl the ftudy as a ftudy of indusfion that the amount 
of ufeful refult which it had recorded in the mind of william 
tell in the fhape of habit would not have been augmented by 
dedusiive knowledge of an intermediatej with which he had 
nothing to do but let knowledge advance under both modes 
of progrefs and tell becomes an artillery officer the rude arrow

a truly fhaped and balanced ball means of meafurement are ap 
plied the true curve is more correftly reprefented than by the 
parabola and thirty pounds of iron are thrown to four times the

moft equal to that of the legend

that a very trifling amount of it tells ferioufly in a long journey 
here is one ufeful refult which natural induction does not com 
monly teach and there may be many more of the fame kind 
the queflion between it and regular fludy requires the confldera

better but of what is not done 

next m jourdain did not pronounce d and f more cor 
re£uy after his attention had been called to the details of the zk 
of pronunciation none but moliere ever knew whether he did 
or not but all who have watched the progrefs of inflru£tion 
know that the bad habits or natural imperfe£tions of children are 
removed or alleviated by making them practice mechanical pro 
nunciation with perceptive adoption of rules in every one of 
a few detached inflances in which i have feen children at their 



on indubion 

reading leilbns in france i have noticed that a return upon the 
habits of pronunciation is always a part of the exercife and that 
the letters are pronounced with that diftinft effort which makes 
the pupil fenfible of the a£tion required i have always attri 
buted to this practice the more uniform ftandard of pronunciation 
which prevails among the educated french as compared with 
ourfelves 

but the ftudy of grammar makes no difference in the fpeech 
of people who have always lived in good fbciety if mr macau 
lay mean merely as to the ufe of jhall and and the like it 
may certainly be faid that the perpetual ufe of fpeech which is 
not reafoning does enable every one to form the habits of thofe 
about him but that grammar as a whole produces no effe£l 
upon the fpeech of good fociety is one fide of a balanced matter 
of opinion many contend that it has produced in our gene 
ration and the one above it a very unfortunate effeft they aver 
that the purity and character of our englifh has been deteriorated 
by lindley murray and his fchool and that we much want better 
grammar teaching on the fubje£i of jhall and willy it is re 
markable that mr macaulay whom a vigorous culty of illuf 
tration combined with immnfe reading enables to flrew his 
path with inflances has to invent his cafe and to refer to a 
treatife which robertfbn could have written but it is not 
enough if we grant that fuch a treatife would have been lumi 
nousy we may be fafe j but would it have been correal and 
further knowledge mufl abdicate at once if we pronounce ufe 
lefs all that has been clearly explained by thofe who have not 
rightly praftifed bacon himfelf might have taken exfors ipfa 
fecandi for his motto 

next it is faid that no man ufes figures of fpeech more cor 
reftly becaufe he knows that one is metonymy and znoiex fynec 
doche true and in like manner no man confiilts his books 
more eafily becaufe he has a bookcafe but having the book 
cafe he arranges his books in it and then he knows where to 
find them mr macaulay dwells throughout upon nomencla 
ture i might infifl upon its fuperflru£ture but even mere 
naming is ufeful when the meaning of the name is clearly under 
flood a mind well flocked with underflood names cannot 
keep itfelf from being conftantly in the al of claffification

the firft is comparifon and induction leads to refledion culti 
vates tafte and gives power the drayman who calls out in a 
paflion you are a pretty fellow without knowing that he 
is uttering irony is an incomplete pi£hire there is omitted a 
wifli relative to the eyes of his opponent and an adjedtive which 
is in fuch quarrels fometimes prophetically but feldom defcrip 
tively true the value of the difference between this favage 
irony and the more elegant form of it which is fo pleafing in the 
defcription of the plain mans induction quoted above is not 
within the comprehenfion of the drayman the foundation of a 
better mode of expreffion than undifciplined rhetoric furniflies fo 
far as its adoption is matter of tafte was laid by thofe who placed 
irony among the primary tropes good tafte is a refult of com 
panions which could not have been made without nomenclature

a fyftem is a tool and it muft be employed upon materials

was obtained by help of wood one of the firft ufes of it was to 
make better tools toget more iron with which better tools ftill 
were made and fo on and in this way we may trace back any 
art to natural tools and to materials which are to be had for the 
gathering the aflertion made by mr macaulay and many 
others that in logic only of all the abftraft fciences our natural 
means are as good as thofe which refult from diligent analyfis is 
one which terminates in an iflue of faft the inftances given 
are contained in the aflertion that a man offenfe fyuogizes in cefare 
and celarent all day long without fufpesiing itj and though he 
does not know what an ignoratio elenchi is can always dete£l 
it when he meets with it 

mr macaulay begins with an indefinite term a man offenfe 
and the claufe is deficient in logical perfpicuity firft what is a 
man offenfe i grant that i fhould doubt the fenfe of a man who 
could not make the inferences defcribed by cefare and celarent 
but do men become men of fenfe by nature without education 
if yes i deny the aflirtion that men of fenfe reafon corre£uy in 
cefare c the man of fenfe who is not educated is as likely 
to afliert that cefaro is all that can be obtained or to invent the 
foxvn fefape as the plain man to forget to try the mince pies 
without brandy before he concludes if no then the afliertion 
is itfelf ignoratio elenchi for the very queftion is how to make 
men of fenfe can they not be ceteris paribus formed better and 
fafter with ftudy of logic than without it being agreed on all 
hands that this man of fenfe is always a practical logician 

next a man of fenfe reafbns c without fufpefting it 
sufpebing what that he is reafoning or that he is reafoning in 
cefare i fuppofe the latter that is to fay i take it to be meant 
that a man of fenfe may not muft for fome ariftotelians are men 
of fenfe not know that the logicians call the form of reafoning 
he ufes cefare this is cafily granted but what is it but the 
celebrated ignoratio elenchi of locke who fancied that he raifed 
an objeflion againft the pretentions of the logicians when he 
declared he never could believe that god had made men only 
twolegged and left it to ariftotle to make them rational no 
one ever denied that men reafbned before ariftotle and would 
have reafoned ftill if he had never lived 

mr macaulay probably without fb much as a new application 



 on induslion 

to the inkftand after falling into the ignoratio elenchi fingles out 
this vfery fallacy as the one which a man of fenfe is fure to dete£t 
but if there be a fallacy which is the ilaple of paralogifm it is 
this one delelat domi for ordinary difcuffion efpecially after 
dinner is little elfe impedit foris for three fourths of public 
debate from the houfes of parliament downwards is made up 
of it a man who expofes it in converfation is confidered a

no converfation he harps upon one fubjes he wont let

i have made the above comments upon a very marked paflage 
of an eminent writer in preference to introducing their fub 
ftance as a diftertation of my own that i might have the advan 
tage of the reader feeing that i meet real arguments inilead of 
my own verfion or feleftion it woidd probably be difficult to 
find a better concentration of the fubflancc of the antagonift 
views with refpes to the formal fludy of reafbning than is 
contained in my quotation from mr macaulay and i may fafely 
take his adoption of them as proof that thefe views yet require 
the notice of a writer on logic 



there is one refult of the theory of probabilities clofely con 
nected with induction proper which it will be advifable to notice 
here 

when the fyllogifm is declared illegitimate on account of 
both premifes being particular a probable conclufion of great 
flrength may be admitted in many cafes this mufl be the 
more infifled on becaufe it is too common to attend to nothing 
but the demonflrative fyllogifm leaving all of which the con 
clufions are only probable however probable entirely out of 
view 

i take as the inflance the fyllogifm or imperfeft fyllogifm 
 some xs are ys fome zs are ys therefore there is fomc pro 
bability that fome xs are zs if the number of xs and zs 
together exceed the number of ys as in chapter viii there is 
a certainty that fome xs are zs let us then fuppofe this is 
not the cafe 

let the whole number of ys in exiflence be and let m and 



on indusiion 

n be the numbers of xs and zs which are among them i 
fhall confider two diftinft cafes — firft when the diftribution 
of the xs and zs among the ys is utterly unknown fecondly 
when their diftribution is that of contiguity that is when the ys 
being for fome reafon arranged in a particular order the xs 
which are ys are fucceffive ys and the feme of the zs which 
are ys 

for the firft cafe a very rough notion will do confined to the 
fuppofition that few xs and zs are mentioned compared with 
the whole number of ys when the xs and zs together make 
a large proportion of the ys in number then if we have no 
reafon for making them contiguous or otherwife limiting the 
equdlly probable arrangements it may be aid to be a moral cer 
tainty that fome xs are zs 

in the firft cafe if we divide times the produft of m and n 
by too times it gives us a fufficient notion not large enough 
of the common logarithm of the odds in favour of fome 
xs being zs being to i say there are ys and that 
too xs are ys and zs are ys then x x 
divided by x is which is the logarithm of 
it is then more than to i that in this cafe one or 
more xs are zs a more exaft rule is as follows to 
divided by iooi add its hundredth part and to the refult add 
fuch a fraftion of itfelf as is of u thus ioo 
being which with its hundredth part is and w 
 being the tenth part of u or we add to its 
tenth part giving which is about the logarithm of oo 
ftill under the mark it is more than to i that fome xs 
are zs when the fraftions are very fmall this rule is accurate 
enough if n be confiderable its refult is that if y be very con 
fiderable and if a perceptible fraftion of the ys be xs and a 
perceptible fraction zs and if we really have no reafon to make 
the limitation of contiguity or the like then we are juftified in 
treating it as a moral certainty that fome xs are zs but i fuf 
peft the relation of contiguity to which i now proceed better 
reprefents the aftual ftate of the cafe in ordinary argument 

when the xs which are ys are contiguous and alfo the zs 
which are ys the probability that no xs are zs is the fraftion 
having the produft of — — and u— — for nu 



 on induslion 

merator and the produft of u— and u— f i for denomi 
nator thus in the example above propofed looo ys contaming 
among them loo xs and loo zs each fet contiguous we have 
 x for numerator and x for denominator this 
fraction is about tenths j fo that it is now to or to i 
againji any xs being zs 

in order to find the probability againft the number of xs 
which are zs exceeding i add k to both the multipliers in the 
numerator which then become — w — ii and —— 
hif for example there are loo ys containing xs and 
 zs each fet contiguoufly what is the chance againft the 
number of xs which are zs exceeding the numerator is 
x the denominator is x this fra£hon is by 
 whence it is to againft or to more 
than to ifor the number of xs which are zs exceeding lo 

the chances it is to be remembered are all minima ex 
cept when we mean that m xs and not more are ys c thefe 
queftions may ferve to give fome notion of the manner in which 
arguments not logically conclufive may be morally fo 

what is called circumjiantial evidence is a fpecies of indudion 
by probability the thing required to be found has the marks 
pqrs c this y has the marks pqrs c there is then 
a certain amount of circumftantial evidence that this y is the 
thing we want to find if it can be fhown that there is but one 
thing which has all thefe marks then the circumftantial evidence 
is demonftrative but if there were fay ys of which 
have the mark p the mark q c then having afcertained 
one y which has all the marks the queftion is what chance is 
there againft another y having them all the fame chance at 
leaft is there that the y found is the one fought inftead how 
ever of attempting the problem in this way which is never 
reforted to for want of data i mean that the refemblance which 
the rough proceffes of our minds bear to thofe of the theory of 
probabilities does not here exift i take it as follows if the 
poiteffion of the mark p give a certain probability to the y 
found being that fought it is as a witnefs whofe teftimony has a 
certain credibility similariy for qrs c compound thefe 
teftimonies when known by the rule in page and the refult 
is the value of the circumftantial evidence 



 



chapter xii 
on old logical terms 

in this chapter i propofe to fay fomething on a few terms of 
the old logic which though they keep their places in works 
on the fubjeft and have fome of them paited into common lan 
guage are very little ufed they relate generally to the fimple 
notion and the name by which it is expreffed and have little of 
fpecial reference either to the propofition or fyllogifm they 
are moftly derived from ariftotle whofe incidental expreffions 
became or give rife to technical terms and whofe fingle fentences 
were amplified into chapters and here as in other places i 
have nothing to do with the degree of correftnefs with which 
ariftotles meaning was apprehended nor even with how much 
was drawn from ariftotle and how much added to him but only 
with the aflual phrafes and their ufual meaning 

the words logic and dialeics are now ufually taken as 
meaning the fame thing the old diftindion is that dialectics is 
the part of logic in which common and probable but not necef 
fary principles are ufed but the diftinftion is neither clearly 
laid down nor faithfully adhered to even by ariftotle himfelf 

the term in this work always called name was divided into 
fimple and complex the fimple term was the mere name the 
complex term was what all moderns call the affirmative propofi 
tion thus man and run were fimple terms man runsj a com 
plex term later writers rejefted this confufion and divided 
the a£ls of the mind confidered in logic into apprehenfion judg 
ment and difcourfe taking cognizance of notions propofitions 
and arguments the common meaning of the word difcourfe 

 our language is capricious with regard to the ufe of iingular and plural 
of words in ic thus we have logic and dialecticr arithmetic and mathema 
ticr phyiic and phyficr for medicine and natural philofophy some modern 
writers are beginning to adhere uniformly to the fingular in which i cannot 
follow them for i am afraid an engliih ear would not bear with matte 
mafic as a fubftantive would it not belter coniift with the genius of our 
language if the plurals were to be always ufed and the fingulars made ad 
jectives without the termination al 



 on old logical herms 

which now generally applies to ibmething fpoken is derived 
from its place in this divifion the word argument which is 
now equivalent to reafontng againft oppojition exprejfed or implied 
was originally nothing but the middle term of a fyuogifm 

the fimple term was univerfal or jingular univerfal when 
of more inftances than one as man horfe ftar lingular when 
of one inftance only as the fun the firft man the poleftar this 
book singular names were called individuals from the etymo 
logy of the word as belonging jto objefts not divifible into 
inftances to each of which the name could be applied i have 
not dwelt upon the diftin£tion between angular and univerfal 
becaufe it is ineffeflive in inference and moreover a lingular 
propofition is only objeftively fingular but ideally plural jidius 
caeiar was a roman in point of fa£t there was but one cseiar 
but take any imaginary repetition of the circumftances of caelars 
life fuch for inftance as occurs to thofe who have thought of 
the poffibility of the lame courfe of events returning into exift 
ence after a certain cycle and then the term csefar becomes 
plural or even without fo forced a luppofition we may lay 
that if we defcribe caeiar we muft defcribe a roman that our 
delinition of caeiar is fo clofe as to fit only one man that ever 
lived makes no eltential difference in the chara£ler of the prp 
polition 

but a further diftin£tion which was made divided lingular 
terms into fubjefts of univerlal and lubjess of particular propo 
litions a determinate or definite individual as csefar this 
man was the former a vague or indefinite individual as a 
certain man the firft comer was the latter the diftinftion is 
that of fome man and this one man 

certain notions of eflence or relation accompanying the ap 
prehenlion of a name were called categoriesy or predicaments 
meaning modes of altertion with relpeft to the objes named 
ariftode gave ten categories and might have given ten hundred 
in their ufual latin form they were fuhftaniiay quantitasy quali 
tasy relatioy asfioy pajjioy ubiy quandoy jitusy habitus 

the word tranflated by fubftance ktrloy means mode of being 
and its literal latin is ejfentiay eflence it is ctuxqa fubjlance that 
which ftands under as fupporting accidentsy prefently explained 
it is fdx too metaphylical a term to come into common life with

which a thing is compofed whether material or not accordingly 
we have the material fubftance of a coat the intellefkual fub 
ftance of an argument but as we ufe the word its meaning 
belongs to the other predicaments in faft the fubftance of the 
old logicians ftands as to exiftence in the fame fituation as mat 
ter page with refpedl to our fenfible perceptions or objesi 
with refpeft to our ideas the fubftance it was faid is per fe 
fubjijiens while the accident could not be faid ejfe but inejfe 
the diftinftion between the fubftance mode of being and the 
material fubftance in the modern fenfe may be helped by the 
diftinsion between fubjiantia prima and fubjiantia fecunda the 
firft referring to the individual the fecond to the general term 
thus the fubftance of ohn ls johnws fubantia prima as 
man fubjiantia fecunda all thefe very metaphyfical notions 
were the ftudents firft introdu£tion to logic and were confidered 
as of the utmoft importance 

the predicament of quantity derived from the notion of whole 
and part was conceived as either continuous or difcrete in con 
tinuous quantity the unit was divifible in difcrete indivifible 
thus ten feet is continuous ten men difcrete the diftinftion 
is precifely that of magnitudinal and numerical 

ality was fubdivided into i habit and difpojition the latter 
term being ufed for the imperfeft ftate of the former power 
and want of it patibilis qua lit as and pajioj applied to the 
ideas of that which is undergone the firft permanently the fecond 
for a time form nd figure 

relation then as now referred to the fuggeftions derived from 
comparifon of twathings or ideas it was divided into verbal 
and real fecundum did zxajecundum ejfe thus the relation of 
profit to profitable was verbal that of father to fon or of above 
to belbw real the two things related or correlatives were called 
fubjesf and term fo that of two correlatives giving two oppofite 
relations the fubjeft of either was the term of the other the 
fundamentum of the relation was that in which it took its rife 
when it had a beginning 

asfion and pajjion the produftion and reception of an effeft 
requiring the producing agent and the receiving patient were 
divided into immanent or enduring in the agent and tranfient

according as their eifeds were of the fame or different fpecies 
a few years before the publication of newtons principia it was 
taught in a work imported into cambridge that when mice bred 
mice the adion was univocal but when the sun bred mice the 
writer muft have been thinking of ariftode and fome of the 
fchoolmen aequivocal there was alfo the terminus a quo and the 
terminus ad quem to reprefent the ftate before and the ftate after 
the aftion thus when all this nonfenfe was fent to coventry 
the terminus a quo was an immenfe quantity of univocally bred 
learning of the preceding kind the terminus ad quem was the 
rooting up of the wheat of logic with the tares

relative pofition gave no peculiar terms of fubdivifion the 
habitus sxev referring to pojfejjion generally in the firft inftance 
was materialized by fome of the old logicians till it related to 
drefi only or habit in the thence acquired meaning 

the word predicament and category as well has been intro 
cuced into common language to fignify a fet of eircumftances

the predicahles kamyopifabva are diftinguifhed from predica

the differentia is that by which one clafs be it fpecies or 
genus the difference being accordingly ttrma jpecific or generic 
is diftinguiflied from another thus the difference or one differ 
ence feparating the fpecies man fvom the other fpecies of the 
genus animal is the epithet rational 

the proprium or property is that which belongs to the fpecies 
only whether it be to all or only to fome thus to ftudy and to 
fpeak are equally propria of man but the old commentators 
give definitions of the property as follows there are four 
kinds i that which belongs to the fpecies alone but not to 
all to all the fpecies but not to that alone to the 
fpecies only and to all of it but not at all times to tha 
fpecies alone to all and always 

the accidens or accident is that which may fometimes be 
long to the individual of a fpecies but not neceffarily nor to that 
fpecies alone in modern language the term is limited to what 
is unufual and unexpected 

the word caufe was ufed by the ancients in a wider fenfe 
than by us more nearly in the fenfe of the latin caufa or the 
italian cofa caufes were diftinguiflied into material formal 
efficient ixia final the material caufe was the very matter of 
a thing confidered as a kind of giver of exiftence formal 
caufe was its form in the fame light j the efficient caufe our 
common englifli word the agent or precedent and the final 
caufe the ultimate end or objeft confidered as a reafon for the 
exiftence of the thing sometimes writers ftill talk of final 
caufes and are as unintelligible to moft readers as if they had 
talked of final beginnings 

the word form was ufed in a wider fenfe than that of figure 
or fliape to mean as it were law of exiftence mode difpofition 
arrangement mere figure or fliape was only one of the acci 
dental forms as diftinguiflied ftova fubjlantial forms belonging to 
the fubftance and motion was as widely ufed zform it meant 
any alteration thus corruption was one of the motions of mat 
ter change from place to place to which the modern word is 
confined was local motion 

the original ufe of the ttvms fubjesf and objesf is to denote a 
thing confidered as that which may have fomething inherent in 
it or attached to it or fpoken of it c and as that which may

be objesfed to the mind or reafbn or made to come in its way 
thus it was iaid that matter is the fubjesf of thofe properties 
which are the objesfs of the mind in natural philoibphy the 
tranhtion to the modem fenfe of objesf namely end propofed is 
natural enough in modern times fiibje£l and obje£t are ufed

technically under probability chapter ix from neceffity to 
impoffibility the theory of probabilities i take to be the un 
known god which the fchoolmen ignorantly worlhipped when 
they fo dealt with this fpecies of enunciation that it was faid to be 
beyond human determination whether they moft tortured the 
modals or the modals them their gradations were necejfary 
contingent pojjible impojible contingent meaning more likely 
than not poffible left likely than not thefe they conne£ed 
with the four modes of enunciation a i o e and when by 
fome is meant more than halfy the connexion is good the con 
troverfy about modal forms continues up to this day among 
logicians who are not mathematicians i fhould fuppoie that the 
latter would never give it a thought except as a branch of the 
theory of probabilities and except as to the confideration how 
the terms by which the nonmathematical logician indicates his 
degrees of belief are to be placed upon the numerical fcale in 
like manner he reads the thermometer by graduation and though 
he admits the freezing and boiling point which have an origin 
in nature he leaves temperate fummer heat blood heat c to 
the fancy of thofe who choofe to employ them 

at the feme time it is clear that thefe modal forms were con 
fidered not merely as ufeful in expreffion of the nature and amount 
of belief but as fuggeftive of real branches of inquiry iubfervient 
to that great a priori inquiry into the nature of things to which

mediaeval logic was applied we are not fit to judge of the in 
ftrumental part of this philofophy unlefs we confider alfo the 
materials on which it was founded in an age in which much 
more faith was demanded of the ftudent than now when he was 
much more frequently required to decide in one way or the 
other upon a fingle teftimony when in addition to the non 
mythic wonders recorded in ancient writers which there was no 
mode of contradifting all that was known of immenfe regions 
and countries refted upon very few accounts and thofe filled 
with ftories quite as ftrange — the abfence of other means of 
diftinguifhing truth fiom falfehood obliged thofe who thought to 
lay much ftrefs upon a priori confiderations it matters litue to 
us whether we infer the necejjity of man being a walking animal 
from the nonarrival of exceptions and thence the univerfality 
of the rule or the univerfality from the fuppofed perfefl indusion 
of inftances and thence the neceffity but it was of much more 
confequence to the old logician of more real coniequence he 
did not know but that any day of the week might bring from 
cathay or tartary an account of men who ran on four wheels 
of flefli and blood or grew planted in the ground like polydorus 
in the neid as well evidenced as a great many nearly as mar 
vellous ftories as he could not pretend to inductive and demon 
ftrative univerfality even upon the queftion of the form of his

one leading feature of the fchoolmen acute as they were and 
as to reprefentation of notions inventive and which is ihared by 
many more modem writers who have not difciplined themfelves 
mathematically is een in their employment of quantity there 
are inftances of the ftrange ufe the wrong ufe and the noufe 
moft of them arife from indiftin£l apprehenflon of continuity 
which obliges them to accept fuch ftages of quantity as are ex 
prefled by exifting terms without any efibrt to fill up gaps 
there is alfo a flovenlinefs of definition in what rdates to quan 
tity thus dozens of inflances might be given in which the 
fome of the particular propofition is fo defined that we might 
fuppofe it is fome not all inflead of fome it may be all and 
the former is the expreis definition of fome writers and it is only 
when we find in rules that xy does not allow us to infer x y 
nor to contradia xy that we afcertain the real intended 
meaning logicians fays sir william hamilton have 
referred the quantifying predefignations plurimiy and the like to 
the mofl oppofite heads fome making them univerfal fome 
particular and fome between both they mufl have had curi 
ous ideas of quantity who made the propofition mofl xs are 
ys either univerfal or between the univerfal and particular i 
fhould fuppofe that thofe who did the latter mufl have imagined 
fome to refer to a minority 

there is a flrange notion of quantity revived in modem times 
which confifls in making plurality attributes a part of the quan 
tity of a notion it is called its intenfiue quantity or its intenjion or 
comprehenjion it is oppofed to extenjive quantity or extenjion 
which is the more common notion of quantity referring to the 
number of fpecies or of individuals it may be either the individual 
is the real infima fpecies contained under the name thus man is 
not fo extenfive as animal but more intenfive the attribute ratio 
nal ys greater comprehenfion but man refiding in europe is 
lefs extenfive and more comprehenfive than either it is faid that 
the greater the intenfive quantity the lefs the extenfive but this is 
not true unlefs no two of the figns ofintenfion be properties of 
the fame fpecies thus according to fuch flatements as i have 
feen man refiding in europe drawing breath north of the 
equator feeing the fun rife after thofe in america would be a 
more intenflvcly quantified notion than man refiding in europe 



on old logical terms 

but certainly not more extenfvue for the third and fourth dements 
of the notion muft belong to thofe men to whom the firft and fe 
cond belong thus in the portroyal logic one of the earlieft 
modern works according to sir w hamilton in which the dif 
tinflion is drawn it is faid that the comprehenjion of the idea of a 
triangle includes fpace figure three fides three angles and the 
equality of the angles to two right angles but the idea of recti 
linear threejided figure has juft as much extenfion 

the relation between comprehenfion and extenfion exifts and 
is ufeful but not i think as that of different kinds of quantity 
in page where i hold that the propofition is contained in its 
necefltary confequence the view is one of extenfion the ordinary 
view is one of comprehenfion every cafe in which p is true 
is a cafe in which q is true tells us that all the pcafes are con 
tained as to extent number and location of inftances among 
the qcafes but as to comprehenfion every pcafe contains 
all that diftinguifhes a qcafe from other things when in 
page it is faid that the idea of man is contained in that of 
animal i fpeak of extenfion all the inftances to which the firft 
idea applies are among thofe to which the fecond applies but 
as to comprehenfion the idea of animal is contained in that of 
man all that defines animal goes to the definition of man and 
other things befides in page the is of poflteffion of all 
eflential charafteriftics refers to comprehenfion the is of 
identity to extenfion both pofiteffing equally the chara£ber 
under which the verb may occur in logic there is no diftineuon 
which affefts inference for xy has exaduy the fame proper 
ties whether we interpret it as expreffing that y has all the ex 
tenfion of x and may be more or that x has all that y has in 
comprehenfion and may be more 

in pages c we have the mode of reprefenting names 
of more or lefs comprehenfion thus p q r c being cha 
rafteriftics the obvious propofition pqp illuftrates the theorem 
that where the comprehenfion of one name has all that of a fe 
cond as pqh that of p the extent of the fecond is at leaft 
a great as that of the firft and the felfevident poftulate in page 
 by which we may diminifh the extent of a term univerfally 
ufed or increafe that of one particularly ufed may be expreffed in 
language of comprehenfion that is we may augment the com 



 on old logical terms 

prehenfion of a univerfal or diminifh that of a particular thus 
xy gives xpy and x y gives xpy but xyp gives 
xy 

it will be eafily feen that comprehenfion has the irft attribute 
of quantity page there is more and lefs about it but it is 
not of the meafurable kind page as to extent in 
ftances bear a definite ratio to which we can ufe becaufe 
our inftances are homogeneous but different qualities or defcrip 
tions can never be numerically fummed as attributes to any pur 
pofe arifing out of their number does the idea of rational ant 
mal two defcriptive terms fuggeft any ufeful idea of duplication 
when compared with that of animal alone when we fay that 
a chair and a table are more furniture than a chair which is true 
we never can cumulate them to any purpofe except by abftraft 
ing fome homogeneous idea as of bulk price weight c to 
give equal quantitative weight to attributes as attributes feems 
to me abfurd to ufe them numerically otherwife is at prefent 
impofcble 

the reader will havefeen the origin of feveral very common 
terms which are ufed in a enfe coinciding with or at leaft much 
refembling that put upon them by the fchoolmen but there is 
one which has diametrically changed its meaning it is the word 
injlance the word injiantia and alfo svcrraoig implied a cafe 
againjly not for the latter was exemplum fo that injiance to the 
contrary would have been tautology 

i have referred the word enthymeme to this chapter though it 
is always regularly explained in connexion with the fyuogifm 
according to ariftotle evdiu kari ouxxoyiafmi arehiig l euotcov 
kou oyifaslav an enthymeme is an imperfeft fyuogifm from probables 
and figns the modem critics rejeft the word areij imperfesf as 
interpolated the word jign feems to mean indication fymptom 
or efffeft which makes the caufe almoft neceflary or highly 
probable but the fchools took the word enthymeme to mean a 
fyuogifm with a fuppreffed and implied premife fuch as he mufl

on fallacies 

there is no fuch thing as a claffification of the ways in 
which men may arrive at an error it is much to be 
doubted whether there ever can be as to mere inference the 
main obje£l of this work it is reducible to rules thefe rules 
being all obeyed an inference as an inference is good confe 
quently a bad inference is a breach of one or more of thefe rules 
except then by the produftion of examples to exercife a be 
ginner in the deteftion of breaches of rule there is nothing to do 
in a chapter on fallacies fo far as thofe of inference are con 
cerned neverthelefs there are many points connefted with the 
matter of premifes to which it is very defirable to draw a readers 
attention and above all to queflions in which it is not at firft 
obvious whether the miftake be in the matter or in the form or 
in which it may be the one or the other according to the fenfe 
put upon the words 

if there be anything ridentem dicere verum quod vetat writers 
on logic have in all ages moft grievoufly neglefted the prohibition 
in treating this fubjeft and have given the ftudent a prefcriptive 
right to fome amufement one reafbn of this was that the

enough to maintain that x generally meant communication paflage 
from one mind to another by any means as much at leaft with reference to 
the receiving as to the imparting mind and that it is here oppofed to pnotc 
fpeeth in that fenfe throw the verbs back to their primary meanings 
and it will be that which is picked up of the predicate utiwfiyw out about 
the fubjeft if my conjefture be correft the modem enthymeme is here 
put on the fame footing as the fully exprefted fyllogifm

greeks endeavoured to try the new art by inventing inferences 
the fklfehood of which could not be dete£bed by its rules thefe 
as may be fuppofed were whimfical efforts of reafbning never 
thelefs they have been handed down from book to book unfur 
paffed in their way another reafon is that jefts puns c are 
for the moft part only fellacies fo obvious that they excite laugh 
ter j and the greater number of them can be fhown to break one 
or another of the rules of logic accordingly they furnifh 
ftriking examples of thefe rules the application of which in k 
rious terms has itfelf a tafte of the ludicrous boccacio has by 
his inimitable mode of narration made a good ftory the jeft of 
which could be defcribed as confiding in nothmg more than the 
affumpdon that what can be predicated of ftorks in general 
can be predicated of roafted ftorks which is what logicians 
would call the fallacia accidentisj or arguing a didfo jimpliciter 
ad dictum fecundum quid 

the terms fallacy fophifm paradox and paralogifm are ap 
plied to offences againft logic but not with equal propriety 
fallacy and fophifm may technically have been firft applied to 
arguments in which there is a failure of logic but it is now very 
common to apply them alfo to arguments in which there is a 
wifehood of faft or error of principle though logically treated 
and if this lafl ufe be not corre£l writers on logic have lanc 
tioned it in their examples many perfbns go further and call 
the erroneous ftatement itfelf a fallacy that men are in the 
habit of walking on their heads they would fay is a very obvious 
fallacy a paradox is properly fomething which is contrary to 
general opinion but it is frequently ufed to fignify fomediing 
felfcontradi£lory thus the newpaper which recently avowed 



• a fervant who was roafting a ftork for his mafter was prevailecupon 
by his fweetheart to cut off a leg for her to cat when the bird cam upon 
table the raafter defired to know what was become of the other leg t 
man anfwered that ftorks had never more than one leg the mafter very 
angry but determined to ftrike his fervant dumb before he puniihed lum 
took him next day into the fields where they faw ftorks fbudding each on 
one leg as ftorks do the fervant turned triumphantly to his mafter on 
which the latter ftiouted and the birds put down their other legs and flew

its opinion that the repeal of the corn laws would make food 
both cheap and dear is faid to have maintained a paradox the 
modern ufe of the word implies difrepe£l but it was not fo for 
merly thus in the fixteenth century the opinion of the earths

meant neither praife nor blame but only reference to the opinion 
of copernicus as an unufual one the more precife writers of 
our day ufe the word paradox for an opinion fo very angular and 
improbable that the holder of it is chargeable with an undue 
bias in favor of fingularity or improbability for its own fake 
paralogtfm by its etymology is beft fitted to fignify an offence 
againft the formal rules of inference it has been frequently 
abufed by mathematical writers who have fignified by it errors 
of ftatement and undue afiiimptions but it is not completely 
fpoiled for the purpofe and i fhall therefore ufe it to denote a 
formal error in inference as a particular clafe of fallacy or fo 
phifm words which it would now be difficult to diftinguifh in 
meaning some have defined paralogifm to be that by which a 
man deceives himfelf and fophifm that by which he tries to de 
ceive others on what grounds i do not know 

the queftion of a premife being right or wrong in faft or 
principle unlefs indeed it contradict itfelf does not belong to 
logic nor could it fo belong unlefe logic were made in the wideft 
fenfe that attempt at the attainment of the cognitio hri which 
fome have defined it to be all that relates to the colleclion of 
true premifes with refpeft to the vegetable world belongs to 
botany with refpecl to the heavenly bodies to aftronomyj with 
refpeft ta the relation of man to his creator to theology even 
were it within the province of logic it would be impoffible in 
lefs fpace than an encyclopaedia to enter upon queflions con 
nefted with the matter of fyllogifms with regard to paralogifms 
or logical fallacies fo called as an error about the meafure of 
jc ift called a geometrical tvvox the claffification under breach 
vqf rules would be good in form but would afford no bafis for

of evafion thefe it would be almoft impoffible to arrange in 
fatisfaclory order 

ariftotle made a claffification of fallacies which was of courfe 



 on fallacies 

adhered to by the writers of the middle ages in this as in 
every other place when i fpeak of ariftotle and his fyftem i 
fpeak of it as underftood by thofe writers how far they dif 
dndly comprehended their mafter is a queftion into which i 
could not enter here even if i were competent to write on the 
fubje£l it is however iifficiently apparent that the logic of 
ariftotle is not of the purely formal charader which marked the 
diale£bics of the middle ages there is a much more decided 
introduction of the attempt to write on the matter of fyuogifm 
than many perfbns think there is the daffification of fallacies 
feems to be one proof of this and the interpretation of that claf 
fificadon by the middle writers feems to add their teftimony to 
the aftertion in this part of the fubjed they abandon techni 
calities almoft entirely 

it ought to be epecially remembered that we are very diffe 
ently fituated from thofe writers not as to what is fallacy but 
as to what the fpecimens of it produced are likely to be out 
of a world of general principles declared by authority or declared 
to be ielfevident by authority they had to produce logical de 
ductions and of courie the pure fyuogifm and its rules were 
to them as familiar as the alphabet the idea of an abfolute and 
glaring offence againft the ftruclure of the fyllogifm being flip 
ported one moment after it was challenged would no more 
fuggeft itfelf to the mind of a writer on logic than it would now 
occur to a writer on aftronomy that the accidental errer which 
might happen to any one of affixing four cipher inftead of five 
in multiplying by a hundred thoufand would be maintained after 
expofure accordingly their formal chapters on fallacies would 
naturally relate if not entirely to fallacies of matter at leaft to 
thofe in which the fallacy of matter very clofely hinges upon that 
of form and b it is in all the old fyftems which i have exam 
ined the ariftotelian divifion or rather felection for it is far 
from including everything lends itfelf eafily to this adaptation 

we on the contrary live in an age in which formal logic has 
long been nearly banifhed from education entirely we may fay 
from the education of the habits the ftudents of all our uni 
verfities cambridge excepted may have heard leftures and 
learnt the forms of fyuogifm to this day but the pra£lice has 
been fmall and out of the univerfities and too often in them 
the very name of logic is a bye word 



on fallacies 

the philofophers who made the difcovery or what has been 
allowed to pafs for one that bacon invented a new fpecies 
of logic which was to fuperfede that of ariftotle and their fol 
lowers have fucceeded by falfe hiftory and falfer theory in driv 
ing out from our fyftem all ftudy of the connexion between 
thought and language the growth of inaccurate expreffion 
which this has produced gives us fwarms of legiflators preachers 
and teachers of all kinds who can only deal with their own 
meaning as bad fpellers deal with a hard word put together 
letters which give a certain refemblance more or lefe as the cafe 
may be hence what have been aptly called the flipfhod judg 
ments and crippled arguments which everyday talkers arc content 
to ufe offences againft the laws of fyllogifm which are all laws 
of common fenfe are as common as any fpecies of fellacy not 
that they are always offences in the fpeakers or writers mind 
but that they frequently originate in his attempt to fpeak his 
mind and the excufe is that he meant differently from what 
he faid which is received becaufe no one can throw the firft ftone 
at it but which in the middle ages would have been regarded 
as a plea of guilty the current notions about what logic is are 
beautiful and wonderful i have heard a difputant an educated 
man a graduate efcape from allowing himfelf to be convinced 
that he was arguing with a middle term particular in both pre 
mifes by declaring thztfasfs were better thzn fyllogifms the form 
of his argument would have proved that men are plants becaufe 
both require air i he faid produce you fa£f like bacon 
you quibble about their combination like ariftotle 

the ariftotelian fyftem of fallacies contains two fubdivifions 
in the firft which are in disfione or in voce the miftake is aid 
to confift in the ufe of words in the fecond which are extra 
disfionem or in re it is faid to be in the matter 

of the firft fet fix kinds were diftinguifhed as follows — 

i mquivocatio or homonymia in which a word is ufed in two 
different fenfes giving really no middle term if the middle term 
be in queftion or a term in the conclufion which is not the fame 
name as that ufed in the premifes for example all criminal 
anions ought to be punifhed by law profecutions for theft are 
criminal a£lions therefore profecutions for theft ought to be 
punifhed by law here the middle term is doubly ambiguous 

r 



 on fallacies 

both criminal and aslion having different fenfes in the two pre 
mifes but here as in many other cafes the choice lies with 
the fophift to bring the fellacy under the head to which we refer 
it or not it may pleafe him to affert that he means the fame 
thing by criminal asfion in both premifes in which cafe the in 
ference is logical but one or the other premife muft be denied 
as to the matter again finis rei eft illius perfeftio mors eft 
finis vitae ergo mors eft vitae perfeftio here the ambiguity 
may be thrown either on finis or on perfesfio the following 
example can be traced through books for three centuries every 
dog runs on four legs sirius the dogftar is a dog therefore 
sirius runs on four legs it has been the defeft of many old 
works on logic that all their examples have been of that obvious 
abfurdity which is well enough in one or two inftances such 
as nothing is better than wifdom and virtue dry bread is bet 
ter than nothing therefore dry bread is better than wifdom and 
virtue some of the old examples are a moufe eats cheefe 
a moufe is one fyuable therefore one fyuable eats cheefe and 
again ifte pannus eft de anglia anglia eft terra ergo ifte 
pannus eft de terra 

where the fyuogifm is formally put equivocation of the mid 
dle term is generally feen with great eafe the moft difficult 
exception is i think the old fallacy in which giving the name 
of the genus is confounded with giving the name of the fpecies 
and thereby of courfe giving the name of the genus as in to 
call you an animal is to fpeak truth to call you an afs is to call 
you an animal therefore to call you an afs is to fpeak truth 
this equivocation will puzzle a beginner as to its form and the 
more fo from the evident falfehood of the matter the middle 
term is he who fays that you are one among all animals he 
peaks truth and the one who calls you an afs or a goofe cer 
tainly fays that you are one among all animals the equivocation 
is in the two different ufes of the word one in the firft premife 
it is an entirely indefinite one in the fecond it is a lefs indefinite 
one this one is not attached to the quantity of the middle term 
which is univerfal in the firft premife and particular in the fe 
cond but is part of the middle term itfelf 

the manner in which the ferious fallacy of equivocation moft 
frequently appears is in the connexion of the old affociations of

a word which has fhifted its meaning with the altered meaning of 
the fame the word loyal for inftance originally meaning no 
more and no lefs than lawful which as applied to a man meant 
one who refpefted the laws and had not forfeited any right by 
mifbehaviour now means attached to the crown and to the title 
of the holder of it in contefts for fucceffion the winner would 
of courfe affume that lawful men were on his fide in more 
recent times the term was always felfapplied at eleftions by 
thofe who fupported the party which had the confidence of the 
crown for the time being but on fuch occafions abftinence 
from the fallacy which the french call the vote du fait is the 
utmoft which can be expected of human nature 

the word publication has gradually changed its meaning ex 
cept in the courts of law it ftood for communication to others 
without reference to the mode of communication or the number 
of recipients gradually as printing became the eafieft and moft 
ufual mode of publication and confequently the one moft fre 
quently reforted to the word acquired its modern meaning if 
we fay a man publilhes his travels we mean that he writes and 
prints a book defcriptive of them i fufped that many perfons 
have come within the danger of the law by not knowing that to 
write a letter which contains defamation and to fend it to another 
perfon to read is publijhing a libel that is by imagining that 
they were fafe from the confequences of publifhing as long as 
they did not print in the fame manner the welleftablifhed 
rule that the firft publifher of a difcovery is to be held the difco 
verer unlefs the contrary can be proved is mifunderftood by 
many who put the word printer in the place of publifher i 
could almoft fancy that fome perfons think rules ought to travel 
in meaning with the words in which they are exprefted 

a fimilar change has taken place in the meaning of the word 
to utter the fenfe of which is to give outy but which now means 
ufually to give out of the mouth in words as yet i am not 
aware that any perfon charged with the utterance of counterfeit 
coin has pleaded that no one ever uttered coin except the prin 
cefs in the fairy tale but there is no faying to what we may

governments permit what would otherwife be equivocation to 
take a flrong air of truth by legiflating in detail againfl the prin 
ciples of their own meafures the windowtax is a fpecial in 
ftance a newfpaper calls it a tax upon the light which gods 
beneficence has given to all the anfwer would be plain enough 
namely that it is an income tax levied upon a ufe of that light 
which how truly matters not here is afterted to be a fair criterion 
of income but this anfwer is deflroyed by the permiffion to 
block up windows and thereby evade the tax which is thus 
made to fall upon the light ufed and not upon the means of 
ufing it which the fize of the houfe affords according to the 
principle of this impofl the blocked window is as fair a crite 
rion of the income of the occupant as the open one and ihould

among the forms which the fallacy of equivocation frequently 
aftumes is that of the fbphifl altering or qualifying the known 
meaning of a word in his own mind without giving the other 
party any notice fo that there may be if not two meanings in 
 e mind yet different meanings in the two minds concerned

there is a wide range of equivocations arifing out of mean 
ings which are fometimes implied and fometimes not a large 
clafs of them is made by the ufual but not univerfal practice 
of giving to the thing the name pf that which it is intended 
to be whether the attempt be fuccefsful or not this is now 
abbreviation or courtefy but it was the rule according to old 
definitions bad reafoning is reafoning fyllogifmus fophtfticus is a 
fyuogifm and in an old book now before me the fruits and effefts 
of demonftration are fcience opinion and ignorance the latter 
containing belief of falfehood derived from had demonftration 
which we fhould now call no demonftration 

one fallacy of our time and a very favourite one is the fet 
tlement of the merit of a perfon or an opinion not by arguing 
the place of that perfon or opinion in its fpecies but by arbitrary 
alteration of the boundary of the fpecies with the intent of ex 
cluding the individual in queftion altogether 

it is fomewhat analogous to the proceeding of the landlord 
who unroofs the houfe to get rid of a tenant thus we have 
had the controverfy whether pope was a poet not whether he 
was a good poet or a bad one but whether he was a poet at all 
the difputants or fome of them claimed a right to define a poet 
and decided that none but verfemakers of a certain goodnefs to 
be fettled by themfelves were poets they might juft as well 
have decided on their own authority that none but men of a 
certain amount of reafoning power were men had they done 
this laft as long as they fixed the amount at a figure which in 
cluded themfelves under the name nobody would have thought 
they materially altered the extent of the term it is not eafy to 
fee why they have rights fo arbitrary over words the objeftive 
definitions of which are nearly as well fixed as that of man 

another form of the macy of equivocation is the afluming 
without exprefs ftatement that the meaning of a phrafe can be 
determined by joining the meanings of its feveral words which 
is not always true in any language when two words come to

gether it often happens that their diftionary meanings would 
never enable us to arrive at their known and ufual and therefore 
proper compound meaning though they might help us in ex

crofe a bridge in an incredibly hort time and redeems his pledge 
by croffing the bridge as one would crofs a ftreet that is by 
traverfing the breadth now though it be true that in general 
to crofs is to go over the breadth or fhorter dimenfion yet in 
the cafe before usj the phrafe is elliptical and fignifies croffing

it is common enough in controverfy for one fide or the other 
to have fixed meanings of words in his own mind on which he 
proceeds without any inquiry as to whether thofe meanings will 
be conveyed by the words to the other fide or to the reader it 
is very difficult to avoid this form of the fallacy without giving 
the meanings of the moft eflential terms on the firft occafions 
of their occurrence it is not uncommon to meet with a writer 
who appears to believe at leaft who certainly afts upon the 
notion that the right over words refides in him and that others 
are wrong fo far as they differ from him i do not only mean 
that there are many who have an undue belief in their own 
judgments both as to words and things but i fpeak of thofe 
who though fhowing a proper modefly in refpeft to their own 
conclufions feem to be unable to do the fame with refpeft to 
their definitions of words if all mankind had fpoken one lan

perhaps a univerfal fchool of philofophers who would have be

equivocation may be ufed in the form of a propofition as 
for inftance in throwing what ought to be an affirmative into 
the form of a qualified negative with the view of making the 
negative form produce an impreffion thus a controverfial

 the fallacia amphiboliay or amphibologia differs in nothing 
from the laft except in the equivocation being in the conftruc

or as in qui funt domini fui funt fui juris fervi funt do

ftruflion in our language arifing from want of inflexions and 
genders are tolerably and intolerably numerous the dif 
ficulty of determining the emphatic word often gives a doubt as 
to the meaning but very often indeed there is a want of the 
diftinftion which the algebraift makes when he writes threeand 
four tens as diftinguifhed from three and fourtens

it mufl be remembered that the word ally in a propofition is not 
neceftarily fignificative of a univerfal propofition it may be a

the term all is coueftive no more diflinguifhing one peer from 
another than one of johns fingers is diflinguifhed from another 
in the phrafe john is a man the fame remarks may be made 
on the word fome as in fome peers are dukes and fbme peers 
are the committee of privileges the all zndfome of the quan

amphibologia as do mofl fources of fellacy falling under this head 
which can therefore hardly be confidered as anything more than 
a cafe of the laft we want another idiom or the algebraical 
diflinftion as in all peers hold of the crown all peers are

he would openly fay by italics or notes of exclamation or 
otherwife is guilty of the fallacia accentus

the alteration of an opponents propofition fo as to prefent it in

is generally not reafoning but retort which is the objeft of the

my opinion have been clear of it though he haa only taken advan 
tage of a wrong but evidendy wrong placement of emphafis on 
the part of the aftailant the ufe of fuch a weapon as to its 
legitimacy depends entirely upon the manner in which the quef

is in the affirmative a very obvious fallacy as a farcafm may be 
permitted but i may here obferve that irony itfelf is generally 
accompanied by the allacia accenttis perhaps cannot be aftumed 
without it a writer difclaims attempting a certain talk as above

i the fallacia accidentis j and that a disfo fecundum quid

on fallacies 

of a disfo jimpliciter ad disfum fecundum quid for the two are 
correlative in the manner defcribed in the two phrafes the firft 
confifts in inferring of the fubjecsl with an accident that which 
was premifed of the fubjecsl only the fecond in inferring of the 
fubjedl only that which was premifed of the fubjeft with an acci 
dent the firft example of the fecond muft needs be what you 
bought yefterday you eat today you bought raw meat yefter 
day therefore you eat raw meat today this piece of meat 
has remained uncooked as frelh as ever a prodigious time it 
was raw when reifch mentioned it in the margarita philofo 
phica in and dr whateley found it in juft the fame ftate 
in of the firft we may give the inftance wine is per 
nicious therefore it ought to be forbidden the exprefled 
premife refers to wine ufed immoderately the conclufion is 
meant to refer to wine however ufed this fpecies of fallacy 
occurs whenever more or lefs ftrefs is laid upon an accident 
or upon any view of the fubjeft in the conclufion than was 
done in the premifes as in the following — all that leads to 
fuch philofophy as that of the fchoolmen with their logic muft 
be unworthy to be ftudied except hiftorically the intent of 
fuch a fentence is not formally to propofe the falfe fyuogifm 
 the fchoolmen had that which led them to a falfe philofophy 
the fchoolmen had logic j therefore logic led them to a falfe phi 
lofophy but only to take the chance of the ftreis thus laid upon 
logic producing a difpofition to fuppofe that the logic was in fault 
the premifes are really — 

the philofophy of the fchool f 

men who paid particular atten is i a falfe philofophy 

tion to logic j 

that the guides to which 
ihould be neglefted except 
as hiftory 

whence it is rightly inferred that the guides to fuch a philofophy 
as that of the fchoolmen who ftudied logic are only of hiftorical 
ufe and the fame thing might equally be inferred of the fchool 
men who ate mutton a praftice to which moft of them were as 
much addifted no doubt as to making fyllogifms the art of 



 on fallacies 

the fbphift conflfts in making the accident which is either un 
fairly introduced or withdrawn or fubftituted have an apparently 
relevant relation to the fubjedl itfelf undoubtedly the fchool 
mens logic has a connexion with their philofophy which the 
mutton they ate has not but as long as it is not the connexion 
which permits the inference it is abfblutely irrelevant 

all the fallacies which attempt the fubftitution of a thing in 
one form for defame thing as it is called in another belong to 
this head fuch as that of the man who claimed to have had one 
knife twenty years giving it fbmetimes a new handle and fome 
times a new blade the anfwer given by the calculating boy 
page note was relatively to the queftion a worthy aniwer 
and took advantage of the common notion that a bean after 
being kinned is ftill a bean as before more ferious difficulties 
have arifen from the attempt to feparate the effintial from the 
accidental particularly with regard to material objefts the 
cartefians denied weight hardnefe c to be eflential to mat 
ter until at laft they made it nothing but fpace and contended 
that a cubic foot of iron contained no more matter than a cubic 
foot of air 

the law in criminal cafes demands a degree of accuracy in 
the ftatement of the fecundum quid which many people think is 
abfurd and it appears to me that the lawyers often help the 
popular mifapprehenfion and give it excufe by confounding 
errors of things with errors of words after the example of the 
world at large any error of any kind provided it be fmall in 
amount pafles for a miftake in words only by virtue of its fmall 
nefs by a miftake in words i mean the addition or omiflion 
of words which whatever they might do under another ftate of 
things do not as matters ftand affect the meaning 

take two inftances as follows j — some years ago a man was 
tried for ftealing a ham and was acquitted upon the ground that 
what was proved againft him was that he had ftolen a portion of 
a ham very recently a man was convifted of perjury in the 
year and an objeftion which the judge thought of impor 
tance enough to referve was taken on the ground that it ought 
to have been in the year of our lord there may of 
courfe be acknowledged rules which as long as they are rules 
muft be obeyed and which may make the fecond miftake as ne

on fallacies 

ceflarily vitiate an indi£lment as the firft but in difcufling the 
policy of the rules it would feem to me that the two cafes are 
entirely different in both no doubt the reft of the indiftment 
might by implication make good the meaning required but 
there feems a great difference between allowing the remainder to 
correft an errorj and allowing it to make good an infufficiency 
fuppofing the date in the fecond cafe to be really infufficient 
in the fecond cafe the accufed may fee the omifeon as well as 
another nd may confider of his defence againft every alterna 
tive in the firft he may be aftually led to appear in court 
with a defence not relevant to what will be brought againft him 
the fecond may be a hardfliip the firft is an injuftice and this 
even on the fuppofition that the reft of the indiftment is to be 
allowed in explanation for we have no more right to fuppofe 
tha the true parts will correft the erroneous ones than that the 
erroneous parts will affeft the conftruftion of the true ones but 
there is good reafon to think that the fufficient defcription of one 
fentence may fupply what is wanted in the infufficient defcription 
of another when infufficiency is all 

but perhaps it will be held to be the better rule that the re 
mainder of the indidlment fliould not be allowed in explanation 
it will then be admitted by all that a material error or a material 
infufficiency fliould be allowed to nullify the charge the dif 
ference between the law and common opinion entirely relates 
to what conftitutes a material amount of one or the other and 
here it is impoffible to bring the two together for the law muft 
judge pecies while the common opinion will never rife above 
the cafe before it in the two inftances which by many will be 
held equally abfurd a great difference will be feen by any who 
will imagine the two defcriptions in each cafe to be put before 
two different perfcns one is told that a man has ftolen a ham 
another that he has ftolen a part of a ham the firft will think 
he has robbed a provifion warehoufe and is a deliberate thief 
the fecond may fuppofe that he has pilfered from a cookfliop 
poffibly from hunger as things ftand the two defcriptions 
may fuggeft different amounts of criminality and different mo 
tives but put the fecond pair of defcriptions in the feme way 
one perfon is told that a man perjured himfelf in the year 
and another that he perjured himfelf in the year of our lord 



 on fallacies 

 as things ftand there is no imaginable difference for 
there is only one era from which we reckon the two defcrip 
tions mean the fame thing nor can it even be aid that one is 
complete and the other incomplete but only that one is leis 
incomplete than the other the next queftion might have been 
what lord was meant our lord jefiis chrift or our lord the 
king both being phrafes of law the anfwer will be that the 
number leaves no doubt which was meant a very good 
anfwer certainly but equally conclufive as to the fimple phrafe 
 in the year the firfl cafe is one in which the two de 
fcriptions have a real difference of meaning it is not o in the 
fecond 

 the petitio priticipiis one of the logical terms which has 
almofl found its way into ordinary life it is tranflated by the 
phrafe begging the quejlion that is aftuming the thing which is 
to be proved this is alfb called reafoning in a circle coming 
round in the way of conclufion to what has been already for 
mally aftumed in a manner expreffed or implied i ihall referve 
what i have to fay on the juflice of this tranflation and take it 
for the prefent as good 

every coueftive fet of premifes contains all its valid conclu 
fions and we may fairly fay that fpeaking objeftively of the 
premifes the affumption of them is the affumption of the con 
clufion though ideally fpeaking the prefence of the premifes 
in the mind is not neceffarily the prefence of the conclufion but 
by this fellacy is meant the abfblute affumption of the fingle con 
clufion or a mere equivalent to it as a fingle premife if the 
conclufion be every x is z and if it be formally known that 
a and x are identical names and alfb b and z then to affume 
 every a is b as a premife in proving every x is z would 
be a manifefl petitio principii or begging of the queflion but 
even this mufl be faid hypothetically it is fuppofed fully agreed 
between the difputants that the two identities are granted let 
it be otherwife and there is no petitio principii it is then fair to 
propound ab which if difputed is to be proved and afterwards 
to reafon as in abf bzaz xaf azxz striaiy 
fpeaking there is no formal petitio principii except when the very 
propofition to be proved and not a mere fynonyme of it is 
affumed this of courfe rarely occurs fo that the fallacy to 



on fallacies 

be guarded againft is the afltumption of that which is too nearly 
the fame as the conclufion required and then the fellacy is 
nothing diftinfl in itfelf but merely amounts to putting forward 
and claiming to have granted that which ihould not be granted 
when this is done it matters little as to the charadler of the 
fallacy whether the undue claim be made for a propofition which 
is nearer to or further from the conclufion to be proved when 
proof is offered the advancement of the conclufion in other words 
is of courfe not petitio principii when proof is not offered the 
affumption of that which with other things proved would prove 
the conclufion is a fallacy of the fame charadter in all cafes 
there is an opponent fallacy to the petitio principii which i fuf 
peft is of the more frequent occurrence it is the habit of many 
to treat an advanced propofition as a begging of the queflion the 
moment they fee that if eflablifhed it would eflablilh the quef 
tion before the advancer has more than flated his thefis and 
before he has time to add that he propofes to prove it he is 
treated as a fophifl on his opponents perception of the relevancy 
if proved of his firfl flep are there not perfons who think 
that to prove any previous propofition which neceflarily leads to 
the conclufion adverfe to them is taking an unfair advantage 

there is another cafe in which begging the queflion may be 
unjuflly imputed it ihould be remembered that demonjirative 
inference is not the only kind of inference there is elucidatory 
inference recapitulatory inference c a propofition may have 
its afterted explanation prefented as a fyllogifm the inference of 
which as demonflration might well be called a refiilt of petitio 
principii say it never could have been doubted that men would 
apply fcience to the produftion of food if there fhould be any 
hefitation about this the explanation of man under the phrafe 
which is exclufively charadleriflic of him rational animal would 
remove it the animal mufl have food the rational being will 
have fcience but it would be begging the queflion to affert that 
the fyllogifm of elucidation a rational animal is c man is 
c therefore man is c is a demonflration and out of this 
arifes the fallacy of prefuming that an author meant demonjlration 
when he can only be fairly conflrued to have attempted elucida 
tion of what he fuppofed would upon that elucidation h granted 
the forms of language are much the fame in the two cafes

had a principium for its major and an exemplum for its minor 
as in all men are mortal principium socrates is a man ex 
emplum therefore socrates is mortal the petitio principii 
then occurred when any one to prove his cafe made it an ex 
ample of a principle which was not among thofe received with 
out offering to bring the former under the logical empire of the 
latter and fome writers define the fallacy as occurring ji 
contingat in fyllogifmo principium petere where by principium 
they mean the principle which generally occurs in the major pre 
mife and by their inftances they clearly how that they mean to 
include nothing but the finiple fyllogifm of principle and example 
they would leave us to infer that if any one hould happen to 
conftrudl a fyllogifm in which both premifes are principles one 
or both not received the inference though denied by fimple 
denial of one or both premifes would not be confidered as tech 
nically the petitio principiiy which with them was as it were 
petitio principii exemplum continentis 

it has often been afterted that all fyllogifm is a begging of the 
queflion or a petitio principii in the modern fenfe an aftumption 
of the conclufion that all premifes do when the argument is 
objectively confidered contain their conclufion is beyond a doubt 
and a writer on logic does but little who does not make his reader 
fully alive to this but the phrafe as applied to a good fyllo

it to what is aftumed in one premife the mofl fallacious pair

mortal plato is a man therefore plato is mortal we dp not 
know that plato is mortal becaufe all men are mortal but that 
we need to know that plato is mortal in order to know that it 
is really true that all men are mortal there is much ingenuity 
in this argument but i think a little confideration not of the

anlwer it 

when we fey that a is b we do not merely mean that the 
thing called a is the thing called b if we fpoke of objedls as

be no other than b is b and the very propofition itfelf would 
be of its own nature a mereidentity an affertion that what is is 
it feems fo me that between objedls thus viewed there can nei 
ther be propofitions nor fyllogifms a may remind us of a thing 
as fuggefting one idea to our minds b of the fame thing as 
fuggefting another and the propofition a is b then aflerts that 
the two ftates of our mind are from the fame external fource 
our logic in wholly feparating names from objefts and dealing 
only with the former makes a fort of fymbolic reprefentation of 
the diftinftion between ideas and objedls 

now the objeftion above ftated to the fyllogifm appears to me 
to be founded upon thinking of the obje£t as if it had no names

by a man of that name plato does not carry man with it his 
major tells him nothing about plato until he has the minor 
 plato is a man and then no doubt he has abfolutely acquired 
the conclufion plato is mortal the whole objeftion tacitly 
aflumes the fuperfluity of the minor that is tacitly aflfumes we 
know plato to be a man as foon as we know him to be plato 
grant the minor to be fuperfluous and no doubt we grant the 
necefety of connefting the major and the conclufion to be fuper 
fluous alfo grant any degree of neceffity or of want of necec 
fity to the minor and the fame is granted to the connexion of 
the major and conclufion 

in the preceding cafe the yllogifm is looked upon as one of 
communication by the authors of the objelion while at the 
fame time it is tacitly afltumed that the minor does not commu 
nicate plato by virtue of our acquaintance with the name is 
taken to be a man 

moreover it is to be noted that the propofition ufed in argu 
ment whether to ourfelves or to others is very frequently not 
fo much the mere attribution of one idea to another as a decla 
ration that pro hac vic£ the idea contained in the more extenfive 
term is all that is wanted and that the diflferences which con 
ftitute the fpecies are not to the purpofe or page it is 
the diminution of the comprehenfion which is neceflfary and the 
increafe of extenfion is only contingent it is ftripping the com 
plex idea of the unnecefiary parts to prevent only what is requi 
fite thus any one who will afiiert that in the mofiuc account 
no animal life whatever was deftroyed by flaughter before the

the place in which it is or in the place in which it is not and it

 the ignoratio elenchi or ignorance of the refutation is what 
we fliould now call anfwering to the wrong point or proving 
fomething which is not contradiftory of the thing aflerted it 
may be confldered either as an error of form or of matter and 
it is of all the fallacies that which has the wideft range such 
for inftance as the cafe of a writer i have read who admits that 
certain evidence if given at all would prove a certain point and 
admits that fuch evidence has been given but refufes to admit 
the point as proved becaufe the evidence was given in aniwer to 
objesions and in a fecond pamphlet the pleadings in our courts 
of law previous to trial are intended to produceout of the varieties 
of ftatement which are made by parties the real points at ifliie

counterfallacy which has no correlative name but might be 
called ignoratio conclujionis if a man were to fue another for 
debt for goods fold and delivered and if defendant were to reply 
that he had paid for the goods furniflied and plaintiff were to 
rejoin that he could find no record of that payment in his books 
the fallacy would be palpably committed the rejoinder fup 
pofed true fliows that either defendant has not paid or plaintiff 
keeps negligent accounts and is a dilemma one horn of which 
only contradicts the defence it is plaintifps bufinefs to prove 
the fale from what is in his books not the abfence of payment 
from what is not and it is then defendants bufinefs to prove 
the payment by his vouchers 

it is commonly faid that no one can be required to prove a

negative and often that no one can prove a negative there is 
much confufion about this for any one who proves a pofitive 
proves an infinite number of negatives every thing that can be 
proved to be in st pauls cathedral at any one moment is fairly 
proved not to be in more places than i can undertake to enume 
rate what is meant is that it is difecuit and may be impoffible 
to prove a negative without proving a pofitive accordingly 
when the two fides of the queftion confift of a pofitive and nega 
tive the burden of proof is generally confidered to lie upon the 
perfon whofe intereft it is to eftablifli the pofitive this being 
underftood it is ignoratio elenchi to attempt to transfer the charge 
of proving the negative to the other party but this rule is by 
no means without exception there are many departures from it 
in the law for example though not und the moft logical 
phrafes for inftance a homicide as fuch is confidered by the 
law a murderer unlefe failing juftification he can prove that he 
had no malice here in the language of the law the homicide 
fuppofed unjuftifiable is in itfelf a prefumption of malice which 
the accufed is to rebut it is not true in point of faft that fuch 
prefumption exifts on the mere cafe of homicide independent of 
the manner of it if the law will confult its own records it will 
find that for one homicide with malice of which it has had to 
take cognizance there are dozens at leaft done in heat of blood 
and called manflaughters but the cafe ftands thus — the alter 
natives are few fo that proving the negative of one which the 
accufed is called on to do can be done by proving the affirmative 
one out of a fmall number there are but malice heat of blood 
miladventure infanity c to which the a£lion can be referred 
of thefe few things it is eafier for the accufed to eftablifli fome 
one out of feveral above all when motive is in queftion of which 
only himfelf can be in poflfeffion of the moft perfeft knowledge 
than it is for the profecutor to eftablifli a particular one and 
the principle on which he is called on to eftablifli a negative or 
rather another pofitive is that the burden of proof fairly lies on 
the one to whom it will be by much the eafieft the proof of 
a negative then being as eaiy as in facst identical with the 
proof of one of the pofitive alternatives fuch proof may from 
the circumftances lie upon a difputant particularly when the

very different thing is of its own nature hardly attainable and 
therefore hardly to be required a book has been miflaid is it

it has been correftly examined no one in fed can prove

somewhat akin to the preceding is the conftant fallacy of con 
troverfialifts conveyed in their ftrong aflertion of the refults of 
their own arguments few can bear to admit that there is a 
queftion for others to decide j and after fumming up both fides 
to feparate the points which the reader is to pronounce upon 
they muft decide for him and thus zgt both counfel and judge 
probably becaufe their arguments are not fo convincing to their 
own minds as they wifli them to be to the readers they prove 
at the utmoft their own conviftion that they have the right fide 
but the thing to be proved is that fuch convidbion is well founded 
they know the maxim si vis me fitre dolendum eft primtim ipfe 
tibi and think it will hold good of the reaibn as well as of the 
feelings as it will to fome the confequence is that the deli 
berate reader fufpefts them and feels inclined rather to differ 
than agree he will not dance to a writer who pipes too much 
juft as pll tell you a capital thing fets the hearer upon avoid 
ing laughter and gives him notice to try fo i intend to give 
moft unimpeachable proof puts the judicious reader upon look 
ing for inadmiffible affumptions and he is feldom allowed by 
fuch writers to look in vain but if the difputant who begins by 
declaring his intention to be irrefiftible be fufpicious the one 
who ends by announcing that he is fo is abfolutely felfconviled 
if it be very clear why fliould he fay it does he tell his reader 
that he muft remember to diftinguifh the black letters from the

white paper or does he print at the top of the book keep this 
fide uppermoft thefe things effential as they are he really 
does leave to the reader but he dares not truft the latter to find 
out though he fays it is as clear as black and white that his ar 
guments are fo flrong and fo good that nothing but wilful dif 
honefly or hopelefs prejudice can refifl their force 

another common form of the ignoratio elenchi lies in attri 
buting to the conclufion afterted fome ultimate end or tendency 
thus an argument in favour of checking the powfer of the 
crown is called jacobinifm of an increafe of that power abfo 
lutifm though the argument propofed may be found indepen 
dently of its propofers wifhes this is a cafe in which the refult 
of the method is juflifiable though the method is wrong many 
readers will remember the advice given by an old judge to a 
young one give your judgments without reafons mofl likely 
your decifions will be right and it is jufl as likely that your 
reafons will be wrong this advice fhould be followed by many 
of thofe who judge or decide arguments the propofer is of a 
known opinion which gives him a flrong bias towards the con 
clufion of the argument he is a witnefs page and the 
effes upon the mind of the receiver is to be that of the united 
argument and teflimony the teflimony is in the receivers 
mind of a low order the propofer is a radical and the receiver 
is of opinion that a radical would pick a pocket or elfe perhaps 
the propofer is a tory and the receiver is of the belief that a tory 
mufl have picked a pocket thefe opinions may be right or 
wrong but they exifl and there is certainly no formal fallacy 
in admitting them as affefting the teflimony to fubtradl from 
the probability of the truth of the conclufion but there is a 
formal fallacy a decided ignoratio elenchiy in throwing all the in 
difpofition to receive upon the invalidity of the argument

cares more for than for all the reafbnings that ever were put

of their oppofition both proceed as if the train of reafbning were

upon teflimony which is more likely to be a guide to truth for 
the mind in queflion than any appreciation of argument which 
that mind could make mufl according to the maxims of the age 
be referred to argument and argument only the perpetual and 
wilful fallacy of that mind is the determination that all argument 
fhall fupport and no argument fhall fhake the conclufion if 
there were only a diflinfb perception of another fource of con

aflertor to attempt to lay down a canon by which to diftinguilh 
the rule from the exception every thing depends upon it for 
the queftion will always be whether the example belongs to the 
rule or the exception when one cafe is brought forward which 
is certainly exception the aflertor will in nine cafes out of ten 
refufe to fee why it is brought forward he will treat it as a 
fallacious argument againft the rule inftead of admitting that it 
is a good reafon why he fliould define the method of diftinguilh 
ing the exceptions he will virtually and perhaps abfolutely de 
mand that all which is certainly exception ftiall be kept back 
fimply that he may be able to aflume that there is no occafion to 
acknowledge the difficulty of the uncertain cafes 

the ufe of the extreme cafe its decifive effedl in matters of 
demonftration may furnifh prefumption as to what it is likely to 
be in matters of aflerted near approach as in the following in 
ftance it feems almoft matter of courfe when ftated to thofe 
who have not ftudied the fubjeft of life contingencies that the 
proper value of a life annuity is that of the annuity made certain 
during the average exiftence of fuch lives as that of the annuitant 
that if for example perfons aged live one with another 
 years an office which receives from every fuch perfon the 
prefent value of forty payments certain will without gain or lofs 
in the long run be able to pay the annuities if this be as was 



 on fallacies 

ftoutly contended by fome writers of the laft century a univerial 
truth it will hold in this extreme cafe let there be two per 
fons one of whom is certain to die within a year from the grant 
and therefore never claims anything and the other of whom is 
certain to live for ever it is clear that the value of an annuity 
to both is o the value of a perpetual annuity but the average 
life of both is eternal one perpetual duration makes the average 
of any fet in which it is perpetual hence by the falfe rule the 
value is two perpetual annuities or juft double of the truth 

we might fuppofe that moft perfons have no idea of a uni 
verial propofition but ufe the language never intending all to 
fignify more than moji and in the fame manner principles are 
ftated broadly and generally which the aflfertor is afterwards at 
liberty to deny under the phrafe that he does not carry tbemfo 
far as the inflance named it would not do to avow that the 
principle is not always true fo it is flated to be always true but 
not capable of being carried more than a certain length kyq 
not many perfons under fome confiifion about the meaning of 
the word general in fcience it always has the meaning of 
verfal and the feme in old englifh thus the catechifm of 
the church of england afterts that there are two facraments 
which are generally neceflary to falvation meaning neceftary for 
all of the genus in queflion be it man chriflian member of the 
church or any other but in modern and vernacular englifh 
general means only ufualy and generally means ufually 

a great deal of what is called evafion belongs to this head 
or to that of the ignoratio elenchiy as the fbphifl anfwers the 
advocates for inflance of the abfblute unlawfulnefs of war never 
tell unlefs prefted what they think of the cafe of refiflance to 
invafion is the country to be given up to the firfl foreigner 
who choofes to come for it sometimes the extreme cafe comes 
into play fbmetimes the aftertion that no one will come which 
is irrelevant as to the queflion what would be right if he did 
come 

among amufing modern evafions are there is no occafton to 
confider that and i dont confider it in that point of view 
any one who watches the manner in which men defend their 
opinions will frequently fee a is b and b is c therefore a is 
c anfwered not by denial of either premife but by that i not 



on fallacies 

the proper point of view or i dont fee it in that light this 
ihould be called the confufion between logic and perfpeftive 

the denial of one univerial is often made to amount to or to 
pafs into the aflfertion of the oppofite or fubcontrary univerfal 
this craving after general truths the moft manifeft fault of the 
old logicians in their choice of premiies did not expire with them 
bacon fays the mind delights in ipringing up to the moft gene 
ral axioms that it may find rejl many perfons are defirous of 
 fettled opinions which is well unlefs by fettled opinions they 
mean univerfal as is often the cafe that bme are and fome 
are not is no fettlement it makes every cafe require examina 
tion to fee under which it falls and with the above we may 
couple the tendency to believe that refutation of an argument is 
proof of the faliehood of its conclufion and that a falfe confe 
quence muft be a falfe propofition hence it arifes that fb many 
perfons dare not give up any argument in favour of a propofition 
which they fully believe they think they abandon the propo 
fition 

it fbmetimes happens that an aflertion is piade which it is 
difficult to fuppofe can be anything but a cafe of a univerfal pro 
pofition and yet the aftertor takes care not to make his pro 
pofition univerfal but perfifts in the particular cafe a logician 
in our day has afterted that when calvin fays that all officers of 
the church ihould be elefted by the people he muft be under 
ftood as fpeaking in reference to deacons only becaufe the 
aflfertion is made in the chapter on deacons if it had been 
roundly ftated that all univerfal propofitions are to have their 
univerfes limited by the headings of the works or chapters in 
which they occur — for inftance that the aftertion that all men 
are mortal occurring in a hiftory of england is to be taken as 
made of englifhmen only — there would have been at leaft no 
ambiguity but as it is we are left to furmife whether this be 
meant or whether the propofition be to apply to calvin only or 
to reformers only or to men whofe names begin with c c 
the odds are that the application of a univerfal propofition will 
be di£lated by the heading of a chapter but the extent to which 
a premife is ajferud as true is not to be judged of by that to which 
it is wanted for ufe and the lefs the nearer we go to the day of 
the old logicians 



 o fallacies 

wrong views of the quantity of a proportion are as frequent 
as any fallacies sonuy meaning moft ndfomty meaning few 
are frequently confounded this is the neceflaiy confequence 
of the nature of human knowledge in which we can but rarely 
form a definite idea of the proportion which the extent fpoken of 
bears to the whole it is part of the value of the mathematical 
theory of probabilities that the mind is accuftomed to the view 
of refults drawn from perfe£uy definite fuppofed cafes y as ufelefs 
it may be in themfelves as many of the queflions in a book of 
arithmetic but neverthelefe good for exerciie it is not furprif 
ing that fallacies about quantity fhould be capable of mofl flrik 
ing expofure in queflions concerning meafurable quantity that 
is in queftions of mathematics nor that there fhould be claftes 
of fallacy of which it is difficult to illuflrate the deteftion by any 
other inflances what can be more clear for example to ordi 
nary apprehenfions than the broad flatement that of things of 
the fame kind that which is ibmetimes right mufl be better than 
that which is always wrong but a little confideration will 
fuggefl that what is always wrong may be as good as that which 
is fometimes right if we do not know how to diflinguifh the 
cafes in which the latter is right and alfo that what is not 
much wrong generally may be more ufeful than that which is 
moflly very wrong when it is not abfolutely right a watch 
which does not go is right twice a day but it is not fo ufeful as 
one which does go though very badly 

to give an account of all the fallacies which depend upon 
wrong notions of quantity would require much fpace and more 
aftumption of mathematical knowledge in my reader than is con 
fiflent with my plan but i may mention the miflaken ufe of 
abfolute terms and notions in queflions of degree there can 
be a difputant will fay but a right and a wrong and if this be 
not right it is wrong many perfons will announce that their 
watches are quite right abfolutely at the true time to a fecond 
and will end by giving the time which was fhown when they 
looked as being accurately that of the inflant at which they 
announce it the proverb frujira fit per plura quod fieri po 
teji per pauciora contains an inaccuracy of degree a bargain 
which cofls twenty fhillings and is worth fifteen is not twenty 
fhillings lofl but only five though the vexation of the party 
overreached will feldom fuffer him to fee this

proverbs in general are liable to this miftake they are often 
uied in exacstly the fame manner as the firft principles of the old 
logicians in hst remembering that thefe firft principles were 
bandied from mouth to mouth till they were perfeftly proverbial 
as we now call it among the learned and obferving the appli 
cation of our modern proverbs as made by the mafs of thofe 
who have not profited by mental diicipline we may fee that the 
faults of the ichoolmen are only thofe of the ordinary human 
mind it is hard indeed if there be a purpofe which a proverb 
cannot be found to ferve it is a univerfal propofition of no very 
definite meaning fan£honed by ufage having the appearance of 
authority and capable of ftretching or contradling like prince

all miftakes of probability are eflentially miftakes of quantity

degree of force which is meant to be given and ftill more fo 
to retain it throughout the whole of a difcuifion a perfon be

require confideration as the cafe may be the forms of language 
by which we endeavour to exprefe diflterent degrees of probability 
are eafily interchanged fo that without intentional difhonefty 
but not always the propofition may be made to aide out of one 
degree into another i am iatisfied that many writers would 
fhrink from ietting down in the margin each time they make a 
certain aflertion the numerical degree of probability with which 
they think they are juftified in prefenting it very often it hap 
pens that a conclufion produced from a balance of arguments

be reprefented by a claim of fuch odds as four to one in its favour

who thus proceeds would not do o if he were required to write 
 in the margin every time he ufes that conclufion this would 
prevent his falling into the error in which his partian readers are 
generally fure to be more than ready to go with him namely 
turning all balances for into demon ftration and all balances

the difpofition to judge the prudence of an aftion by its refult 
contains a fallacy when it is applied to fingle inflances only or 
to few in number that which under the circumflances is the 
prudent rule of conduft may neverthelefs end in fomething as bad 
as could have refulted from want of circumfpeftion but upon 
dozens of inflances fuch a balance would appear in favour of pru

ftylemaker for none but a bad reader and may very poffibly be 
a good arguer for none but a bad logician of courfe i ftiould 
not deny that recurrence of both word and emphafis is a defeat

the confiifion between the means and th end and putting 
one in the place of the other is well enough known in morals 
but there is a correfponding tendency to forget the diftinftion 
between the principle which is to be a£led on and the rule of 
aftion by which adherence to that principle is fecured a refe 
rence to the derived rule is in all refpefts as good as one to the 
firft principle between parties who underftand both and the 
connexion between them but thofe who underftand the rule 
only are apt to forget that a rule may or may not be the true 
expreffion of a principle according to the circumftances ixi which 
it is propofed to apply it if indeed it were of univerfal appli

the preceding caution may be applied in all departments of

it open to inquiry what are the cafes in which this condition is to 
be fetisfied and many cafes might be and are propofed in which 
the inquiry is not eafy to a beginner in law there are not only 
rules but rules for their application to an unlearned fpedator 
particularly in the courts of equity in which the advocate addrefles 
a judge and not a jury the argument takes that technical fqrm 
which makes many perfons think that the whole law is at beft 
only arbitrary rule it may be that fome of thofe who there 
addrefs the court can make nothing better of it and juft as there 
are arithmeticians and good ones too who are but the flaves and 
never the mafters of their procefles fo there may be advocates 
and even judges who have not one element of the legiflator in 
them but there are enough of a higher pecies 

the great art of ufing rules is to apply them in aid and not 
in contravention of the principles which they are intended to 
embody a rule may have exceptions it is faid but this is 
hardly a correfl ftatement a rule with exceptions is no rule 
unlefs the exceptions be definite and determinable in which cafe 
the exceptions are exclufions by another rule the parallel is 
perfect between rules and propofitions page thus all

 on fallacies 

not fo eafy to perceive it is that of drawing upon our former 
felves for the premifes which are to guide us for the time being 
conclufions remain in our minds long after the grounds on which 
they were formed are abandoned and it may happen that one 
premife of an argument will ftill have force when the very rea 
fbns on which the fecond premife is now admitted are contra 
diftory of thofe which once induced us to admit the firft thus 
many who have learnt to advocate the legal toleration of opinions 
which they ftill believe by force of education to be abfolute 
crimes againft fociety are logically the advocates of toleration of 
crime whereas the arguments which they have learned to think 
valid for the firft premife ought if worth anything to teach 
them to deny the fecond i have myfelf heard from one mouth 
in one converfation of courfe not in one part of it that all fins

in printed controverfy the ftatement of the oppofite opinion 
or aftertion may be made by defcription without citation by 
chapter or page by defcription with citation or by quotation 
with or without defcription the firft is not allowable the 
prefumption is ftrong that a perfon who oppofes an opinion im 
putes an error or makes a charge upon the writings of another 
is bound at leaft to cite in a manner which cannot be miftaken 
the part of thofe writings to which he refers there are writers 
who refer defcriptively and even commehtatively putting the 
reference of citation and thus as bayle fays moreri conftantly 
does lead the reader to fuppofe that the words of their para 
phrafe and comment are thofe of the paftage itfelf i do not fee 
that quotation is obligatory though highly defirable but the 
reader muft remember when there is only citation that it is not 
the author cited who fpeaks but the perfon who brings him for 
ward it is a mans own account of his own witnefs with the 
advantage of an apparent offer of enabling the reader to go and 
verify the ftatement for himfelf if the citer be honeft the paf

confequently whenever the citers honefly or judgment is ex

when citations are few they ought perhaps to be quotations 
when they are many it may be imprahcable to make them b 
but extenfive citation ought to be encouraged lazy readers 
do not like it they are not pleafed to have a power of verifica 
tion offered of which they do not mean to avail themfelves j and 
they would rather in cafe of being mifled have to throw the 
blame upon the author than upon their own nonacceptance of 
the offered means of verification accordingly they exprefs 
their difguft at pages loaded with references but the more 
diligent readers confider every citation as a boon at the fame 
time it is to be remembered that there are writers who relying 
on the common difinclination to verify add a large number of 
citations and give the appearance of a ftrong body of authorities 
which are often nothing to the purpofe and fometimes not taken 
from a£tual examination but copied from other writers 

perhaps the greatefl and mofl dangerous vice of the day in 
the matter of reference is the pradice of citing citations and 
quoting quotations as if they came from the original fources 
inflead of being only copies it is in truth the readers own 
fault if he be taken in by this or by the falfe appearance of au 
thority jufl alluded to j for it is in his own power to certify him 
felf of the truth though there may be difficulty when the cita 
tions are many or when fome of them are from very rare books 
honefly and policy both demand the exprefs flatement of every 
citation and quotation which is made through another fburce 
if a perfbn quote what he finds of cicero in bacon it fhould be 
 cicero cited by bacon fays c it has happened often 
enough that a quoter has been convidted of altering his author 
and has had no anfwer to make except that he took the paffage 
from fome previous quoter 

quotations are frequently made with intentional omiffion and 
alteration but no rule ought to be more inflexible than that 
all which is within the marks of quotation ought to be a literal 
tranfcript of the book quoted sometimes the omifiion is made 
becaufe part of the fentence is unneceffary as the quoter thinks 
but this is jufl the point which he has no bufinefs to decide 
without letting his reader know that he has decided it which is

if he decide upon omitting tyrii tenuere coloni in this cafe

categorical than it is in the original turning it from there was

the epithet or even offer proof deftrudlive of it what if he 
fhould deny the antiquity of tyre the omijjion may or may 
not be right but the omiflion without notice or fupprejjion is

the time i write this a clergyman a man of high education and 
charafter both publiihed a fermon in which he gave a verfe 
from the bible within marks of quotation in which he wilfully 
ftruck out one word and inferted another without notice and 
his fermon went through feveral editions either without detec 
tion or without that detedion leading to fuccefeful remonftrance 
i do not fuppofe there was difhonefty here but rather the fol 
lowing reafoning — i am fure it was meant therefore i may 
ftate that it was laid such reafoning is one of the curfes of our 
literature 

there is one alteration within the marks of quotation which 
may at firft feem reafbnable it is alteration of grammar to bring 
the quoted phrafes into connefted engliih with the quoters 
context as when a man fays i know and another perfon 
quoting him fays he knows but it is furely juft as eafy 
to put down he fays i jcnow there is often an alteration 
of emphafis in this adaptation of grammar and generally an in 
troduction of irony and it is xht premier pas to fomething worfe

apt fometimes to put their own paraphrafes under marks of quo 
tation a writer fhould fuit his own grammar to that of his 
quotation and not the converfe 

omiffion of context preceding or following the quotation 
may alter its character entirely and this is one of the moft fre 
quent of the fallacies of reference both intentional and uninten 
tional the only way to infure full confidence is to give the egg 
in its hell that is to begin at a point which clearly precedes 
the immediate fubje£t of quotation and to continue until the 
matter is as clearly paft to give a fentence preceding and a 
fentence following the matter quoted for its own fake diftin 
guifhing the latter this is not always conclufive becaufe the 
fubjecl may be refumed in a fentence or two or in another part 
of the book but it will inform the reader in moft cafes whe 
ther he is or is not likely to differ from the quoter as to the 
meaning of the part quoted and this refers particularly to quo 
tations of opinion thofe of fafl may often be more briefly 
treated with fafety 

in quoting ancient authors in cafes where the text is not no 
torious the various readings hould be given efpecially when it

or if this cannot be done the edition fhould be cited shameful 
things have occurred in controverfy by omiffion of a part of the 
ordinary text which the quoter chofe to conjider as an interpola

liberty to judge for himfelf on that point 

among the cafes of indiret citation fhould be included that 
in which a book is mentioned as exifting not on the authority

chapter xiv 

on the verbal defcription of the syllogim 

in page have made a firft attempt to exprefs the rela 
tions of propofitions in language which will make iyllo 
gifms capable of verbal defcription and the inference of their 
conclufions matter of felfevidence it is deflrable that this fhould 
be more fully done and i accordingly renew the attempt with 
the beft words of defcription which i can find or make any 
one who can fuggeft words which better convey the meaning to 
himfelf will find it eafy to fubftitute them for thofe which i 
have ufed 



defcription of the syllogifm 

the conditions to be fatisfied are that the words fhould have 
as much imported meaning as poffible that everr word and its 
contrary fhould have the connexion of contrariety well marked 
and that the verbal defcriptions fhould be capable of being eafily 
formed from the fymbolic notation as may be fuppofed thefe 
conditions are to fbme extent contradiftory of each other the 
facrifice of either to the others is then to be made to the moft 
advantageous effecst 

there are two ways in which it may be neceftary to defcribe 
the iyllogifm firfl the one hitherto ufed throughout this work 
in which one concluding term is referred to the other by the in 
tervention of the middle term what x is of y and what y is of 
z determine what x is of z secondly that in which the two 
terms are referred to one another by comparifon of both with the 
middle term what x and z feverally are of y determine what 
x is of z 

in the firfl mode the middle term is mentioned and its de 
fcription is middle in the fentence while the reference term is 
underflood in the predicate of each defcription thus when we 
fay a fubcontrary of a fupercontrary is a fubidentical it is that 
a fubcontrary of i fupercontrary of is a fubidentical of z j 
and th fupercontrary of z is the middle term 

in the fecond mode the middle term is underflood in the fub 
jeft and the concluding terms in the predicate of the defcrip 
tion of the iyllogifm thus when we fay genus and pecies are 
genus and fpecies it means that two terms which are feverally 
genus and fpecies of the middle term one entirely containing 
the other entirely contained in the middle term are genus and 
fpecies to one another the firft genus the fecond fpecies 

now it will be very eafily feen that the way to change the 
firft defcription into the fecond is as follows say the defcrip 
tion runs thus p of q is r if q be its own correlative as 
happens when y and z are convertibly connected then p of 
q merely becomes p and q but if qhave another q for 
its correlative then p of q becomes p and qj again if 
r be its own correlative its plural takes its place but if r have 
r® for its correlative it becomes r and r® thus fubcon 
trary of fupercontrary is fubidentical of the firft mode becomes 
 fubcontrary and fupercontrary are fubidentical and fuperidenti 



 on the verbal defcription 

cal meaning that ci and c of the middle term are di and d 
of each other but fubcontrary of fuperidentical is fubcontrary 
becomes fiibcontrary and fubidentical are fiibconlraries 

i need hardly fey that p of q is r with refpeft to x in 
terms of z muft be read q of p is r with refpeft to z in 
terms of x this riile we have already ufed 

it is thus fhown that it is only neceflary to dwell on the firft 
mode and now arifes the queftion what words are to be em 
ployed in defcribing the eight ftandard proportions after a 
good deal of confideradon i prefer to denote the univerfel rela 
tions by pofitive terms and their contrary particulars by the cor 
refponding negative ones not without full perception of the 
acrifice which enfues of the firft condition above mentioned to 
the third 

the words genus zna pedes immediately fueft themfelves to 
denote the relation of y to x and x to y in x y thefe are 
to be underftood as employed up to their limit or the genus and 
fpecies may be coextenfive for two names which have no 
thing in common as in x y i propofe to fay that they are ex 
ternals of each other and for two names which have nothing 
out of one or the other as in x y that they are complements of 
each other remember that complemental does not mean only 
juji complemental which is contrary but may be contrary or 
fupercontrary 

in xy i call x a nortfpectes of y and y a nongenus of x 
thefe words have not as much as i could wifib of imported 
meaning nor are there any pofitive terms which i can propofe 
to fupply their places they appear as fynonymous with not 
entirely contained in and not containing the whole in xy let 
x and y be nonexternals and in xy let x and y be noncom 
plements accordingly in defcribing what x is with refped to 
y we have as follows fhowing the fubflitutions which occur in 
reading the fyllogiflic fymbols into this language 



ai fpecies 
a genus 
£i external 
e complement 



oij nonfpecies 
o nongenus 

ii nonexternal 

r noncomplement 



if we condatx genus and complement as larger terms znd jpecies 



of the syllogifm 

and external fmaller mesj and if we put down each univerfal 
followed by its two weakened particulars writing firft that which 
is of the fame accent we have 



univerial 

a genus 

ai species 

e complement 



firfl weakened form 

r noncomplement 
ii nonexternal 
o nongenus 



el external i oi nonfpecies 



second weakened form 

ii nonexternal 

r noncomplement 
oi nonpecies 
o nongenus 



thus it appears that the primary weakened form of a larger 
name contains a larger name and of a fmaller a fmaller and 
the contrary for the fecondary forms the words primary and 
fecondary do not refer to importance but only to order of deri 
vation thus ai was in our table xy weakened into xy 
before it became yx weakened into yx or xy 

the rules for forming particular fyllogifms by weakening uni 
verfal premifes may now be repeated in a univerfal fyuogifm 
fubftitute for thefrl premife and for the conclufion their primary 
weakened forms or for the fecond premife and for the conclufion 
xheix fecondary weakened forms in a ftrengthened fyllogifm 
fubftitute for thefirji premife its fecondary form or for the fecond 
premife its primary form 

i now write down the whole body of fyllogifms that the rea 
der may exercife himfelf in the independent comprehenfion of 
their meaning and in affent to their inferences deducing the 
particular fyllogifms from the univerfals only

no perfbn could propofe to himfelf a better exercife in the 
acquifition of command over language than praftifing the de 
monftrations of thefe relations or more properly their reduion 
into fpecific fhowing as to the matter of the inference in what its 
extent confifts for inftance the complement of a noncom 
plement is a nonfpecies how and by how much the non 
complement leaves fomething which is neither in the term un 
derflood nor in that noncomplement this the complement 
of that noncomplement muft fill up and by this then at leaft 
the complement of the noncomplement is not in the term under 
ftood of which it is therefore lb far nonfpecies 



r 

of the syllogifm 

in the preceding view i have particularly confidered the con 
nexion between contrary forms and the adaptation of language 
to that connexion but in the firft derivation of the fimple fyl 
logifms page the univerfals were related not to their con 
trarie§ but to their particular concomitants i now proceed to 
the confideration of this view and to the juftification on felf 
evident principles of the aflertion that there is a real and ftriking 
affinity between the univerlal iyllogifm and its concomitants as 
aiaiai and oaio eeia and etoi c 

the complex propofitions di d and ci contain each a uni 
verial which in common language is generally confounded with 
it and a particular the exiftence of which is therefore for the 
moft part fuppoied in thought to accompany the univerfal the 
remaining univerfal e is differently circumfljnced if we fay 
that x and y complete the univerfe we fhould generally mean 
that they only juft complete it and fhould not think ofthe fuper 
contrary relation or of their overcompleting it to be contained 
but not to fill to contain with room to fpare or to overfill to 
exclude and be excluded without completion and to exclude and 
be excluded with completion or to complete and be completed 
without incluflon — are our mofl ufual ideas of the relations of 
the extent of names 

the reduction of the complex propofltion to the fimple uni 
verfal when done by removal of the concomitant particular is 
in all cafes a lowering of the quantity by the removal of an ex 
cefs as follows — 

di means that x is contained in y and more is contained 

d means that x contains y and contains more 

ci means that x excludes y and excludes more 

c means that x completes y and more than completes 

drop the fecond claufes and di c are reduced to ai c 
drop the firfl claufes and it would feem as if we had flill the 



 the alteration of grammar here feen is in deference to the word com 
pletcy the befl i can get in this propofition the verb refers to tae univerfiy 
and it is xjoins in completing the univerfe y and joins in completing more 
than the univerfe 



 on the verbal defcription 

complex propofitions for mre will contain its tacit reference to 
that which it is more than let this tacit reference be dropped 
and then we have inftead of the whole complex propofitiononly 
its particular and this abandonment is adually made in com 
mon language by what would be called perhaps a lax but is a 
very logical ufe of the word more there are more than fifh on 
the dry land would be perfeuy intelligible and not as implying 
that there were any fifh he was actuated by more than the 
motive c very often means other than the motive c 

now in the complex fyllogifm as we have feen page the 
exceffive part of the conclufion whence comes its fecond claufe 
its additive more is the fiim of the exceffive parts of the premifes 
if one of the complex premifes be deprived of its aflertion of 
excefs or lowered into a fimple univerial the conclufion ftill 
remains though not a fortiori neceflarily this being done the 
valid excefs of the conclufion depends upon the excefs of the remain 
ing premife and the concomitant particular fyllogifm confidered 
as part of the mixed complex fyllogifm is the expreffion of this 
without the reft finally the excefs may be ufed in the lax or 
noncorrelative fenie and then the concomitant fyllogifm ftands 
by itfelf 

for example oiaoi may be read thus — confider oi as 
concomitant of a in d x contains more than fomething 
that is not in y z contains x therefore z contains more 
than fomething that is not in y if more than y mean y 
and more this would be dad again oej is more than 
x fomething not x is contained in y y excludes z there 
fore x excludes more than z fomething not in z if more 
than x were x and more c this would be dieici and 
fo on for other cafes 

i now proceed to what i may call the quantitative defcription 
of the fyllogifm by which i mean the expreffion of its cafes in 
terms of the quantities only of its names and propofitions leaving 
the alternative of affirmation and negation to be fettled by the 
law of thefe quantities my reafon for the prefentation of the 
fyftem in fo many different points of view will be obvious enough 
that which claims to be complete muft fhow itfelf to contain juft 
the fame and no more as to refults whatever may be the prin 
ciple which is chofen as the bafis of conftru£tion 



of the syllogifm 

every propofition in fpeaking of two names fpeaks of their 
contraries and page of the four terms two direft and two 
contrary two are univerfel and two are particular since univer 
fal and particular are themfelves properly contraries for every 
x is xs known to be all and some xs are xs not known to 
be air let us fignify the univerlal and particular forms of the 
propojition by v and v again fpeaking of a name let its mode 
of entry univerfal and particular be denoted by t and t writ 
ing down v or v applied to t or t t or t we can make eight 
varieties which give us the eight ftandard forms applied to one 
order fay x y as follows — 



a vtt a vtt eivtt 



evtt 



o v tt oi v tt r v tt ii v tt 

thus i or xy may be defcribed as the particular in which 
both terms are univerfal for x and y are both univerfal in xy 
or x y or yx and vtt defcribes it thus 

if underftanding the order to be xy yz xz we write 
down any three propofitions we make an attempt at a fyuogifm 
valid or not as the cafe may be as in 

vttvttvtt or vvvtttttt 

which muft be ajia it will affift the memory to obferve that 
fubfymbols have vt or vt at the beginning fuperiymbols vt or 
vt alfo that affirmatives have an even number of capitals 
none or two and negatives an odd number one or three a 
univerfal and its particular concomitant have the fame entries of 
t and t and contranominals have inverted modes of entry of 
thefe letters the convertibles have t in both places or t the 
inconvertibles have t and t 

firfl it is unneceftary to write down the termletters of the 
conclufion for they mufl be taken from the premifes in every 
cafe in which the conclufion is the flrongefl that can be drawn 
from the premifes and our fyflem has no others nor indeed 



 the reader mufl here follow the mathematician in confidering o as an 
even number 



 on the verbal defer iption 

has the ariftotelian any other except bramantip thus tttt 
being the term letters of the premifes ftrike out the fecond t 
and the firft t which refer to the middle term and tt muft be 
long to the conclufion to prove this obferve that we know 
that t in the premife cannot give t in the conclufion therefore 
t cannot give t for if the term being z t gave t then put 
ting z properly in its place t would give t which it cannot 
again we know that the valid forms as to propofitions are 
vvv vvv vvv vvv fo that v occurring once only muft 
come third and v muft come in the firft pair further in the 
four term letters of the premifes vvv vvv vvv require tt 
or tt to come in the middle while vvv alone requires tt 
or tt obferve thefe laws and every formation which can take 
place under them leads to a valid fyllogifm putting dots to re 
prefent a blank place we form the eight univerfal fyllogifms by 
filling up the blanks in vvv tt and vvv tt 
the eight ftrengthened fyllogifms from vvv tt and 
vvv tt the eight particulars which begin with a univer 
fal from vvv • tt and vvv tt • and the eight par 
ticulars which begin with a particular from vvv tt and 
vvv tt and under the rules juft given we have no 
other cafes 

taking the preceding as a bafis we might make the rules of 
accentuation follow from it for fince the firft blank in our 
fymbol and the firft concluding term muft agree and fince ac 
cents depend only on the firft two letters in the fymbol of a pro 
pofition we may proceed as follows let k and l each of 
them mean t or t as the cafe may be but with the provifo that 
what it means in either place it fliall mean in the other then 
in vvvkttlkl and in vvvkttlkl in which fym 
bols of conclufion are introduced we fee that the firft and third 
accents muft agree which is part of the direft rule as to the 
firft and fecond accents they agree in the firft inftance above if 
k be t which puts an even number of capitals in the firft fym 
bol vkt or an afiirmative propofition at the commencement 
they differ if k be t which puts a negative propofition firft 
in the fecond inftance they agree if k be t which puts an 
affirmative firft c i leave it to the reader to deduce the other 
cafes of this rule the inverfe rule and alfo that premifes give an 



of the syllogifm 

afermative or a negative conclulion according as they have like 
or unlike figns and thus it will appear that the fymbolic rules 
given in chapter v are really expreffions of the general rules of 
quantity 

it will be obferved that the concomitant fyuogifms of a univer 
fal have the fame term letters as that univerfal and only change 
vvv into vvv or vvv alfo that the inverted fyuogifms of 
page only invert the order of all the termletters and the 
letters of the premifes when different 

thus eiaei being vvvtttt its concomitants tat 
and eioii are vvvtttt and vvvtttt but the in 
verted form aieiei is vvvtttt contranominals have 
different quantities in all the termletters the weakened forms 
of a univerfal change the firft premife letter and the firft term 
letter or the fecond of both thus eieai being v v vtttt 
its weakened forms oieii and eioj are vvvtttt and 
vvvtttt 

the forms of the numerical fyuogiftn page may be re 
covered by few and eafy rules in which the premifes as they fland 
determine the conclufion as follows — let be defignated as 
the number of x and s as that of x and fo on let a term 
of the conclufion be called diresf when it is in the premife and 
inverfe when its contrary is in the premife then 

 in every cafe the conclufion has the fum of the quantities 
mentioned in the premifes as part of the expreffion of its quan 
tity 

 for every inverfe term in the conclufion the number of 
its direft term appears in the quantity of the conclufion fub 
tra£led thus x in a premife with x in the conclufion mufl 
have — in the concluding quantity but the diret terms of 
the conclufion never introduce anything into the concluding 
number 

 when the entrances of the middle term are fimilar yy 
or yy the terms of the two forms of conclufion are both diredl 
and both inverfe with fubtraftion of the number of the middle 
term in the former addition of the number of its contrary in the 
latter thus yy gives — u in the direft i in the inverfe 
form 

 when the entrances of the middle term are difemilar yy 



 on the verbal defcription c 

or y y each form of conclufion has one diredl and one inverfc 
term and no number from the middle term enters the conclud 
ing quantity 

thus the conclufions from wxy wyzare immediately 
written down as 

 — xz and i vi——oxz 
while thofe from mx y yz are at once 

wxz and i — xz 

there are relations exifting between the forms of the fyuo 
gifm which i have not confidered for inftancc the defcription 
of x with refpedi to z being that it is a fpecies at the de 
fcription of its contrary x is thatjt is a fupercontrary e if 
then we give the name of contradefcriptives to ai and e we find 
that a and ei l and o i and oi are alio contradefcriptives 
the arrangement of fyllogifms by contradefcriptives and the laws 
of connexion thence refulting will be an eaiy exercife for the 
ftudent

 leftual rafhnefs is fufficiently manifefl from your pretention to advance 

 logic without having even mattered its principles 

with regard to the fubfequent infinuation of a retraced charge my 
explanation believing as i do that sir w hamilton always peaks fub 
jedive truth is that his mind ihfeniibly fell back to its old bias as he 
felt that the fubftitute for his charge wanted flrength my conclufion is 
that it is unneceftary henceforward to notice any thing he may fay or 
write on my charafter and my determination is to aft accordingly 

sir w hamiltons pamphlet contains about a fcore and a half of quo 
tations on which hang fundry jokes and fneers fbme of them at mathe 
maticians in general and myfelf as one of the body on thefe i fhall 
only fay that my notions of the common fenfe of controverfy and my 
determination to perfift generally in the tone of relpeft to my oppo 
nents learning and charafter which i have hitherto preferved would 
were there nothing elfe prevent my adopting the habit of which they 
are fpecimens but as no man willingly ftands an unreturned fire of 
bicetiae without defiring to prove that his forbearance does not arife from 
want of ammunition i will permit myfelf difclaiming the animus under 
which fuch things are ufually written jufi to how that quotation ap 
plication allufion fneer joke and fling at an opponents ftudies are all 
among the weapons which i could have employed if i had thought 
them worthy of my antagonift or of thofe whom i want to convince 

i might for inibnce have written fomething like the following — 

among the aflets of the old logicians difcovered when the fchools 
were fwept out there was found as is well known the queftion vtrum 
chimiera bombinans in vacuo poffet comedere fecundas intentiones a very 
good title as curll would have faid wanting nothing but a treatife 
written to it now whether it be comedere or whether the fchoolmen 
invented comedere sir w hamilton on whom their mantle has fallen 
has written the treatife and fuccefsfully maintained the affirmative his 



appendix 

notion that his communication could give any hint is clearly and apdy 
defcribed by chimara his ftyle by bombinans his proof by vacuum and 
the fecond intentions above noticed chewed up and given forth with 
his firft ones are a praaical example of the poffibility of the qei he 
or rather the bombinating chimaera which has perfonified itfelf in his 
form as the sao ovsipo did in that of neftor is thus both retraftor 
and detradlor but though the traniition from flops to folids generally 
indicates convalefcence yet as here made manifeft the paflage from 
liquid to dental may be only the growing weaknefs the perifcence of the 
cafe 

i aflert the following documents to be all that are relevant with 
refpeft to the literary part of the controverfy they are given at the 
end of this appendix 

a is an extradl from a communication of mine to the cambridge 
philofophical society made before i received any communication what 
foever grom sir w hamilton i aflert it to contain a diftinft an 
nouncement and ufe of the principle of fitfrrr of the middle term 
be that middle term fubjedl or predicate on this point the reader is to 
judge 

b is a communication from sir w hamilton to me the reader 
is to judge firft whether it contain anything which is intelligible with 
refpedl to any fyftem of fyllogifm fecondly whether if it ihould fo con 
tain anything that fomething would have been information to me who 
had written a on fome matter afterwards found in c 

c is the relevant part of an addition made by me to a when the 
latter came before me in proof the reader is to judge firft whether c 
contain anything more than an application of a fecondly if fo whe 
ther that fomething more is derived from anything intelligibly hinted at 
in b 

the only bare faft on which sir w hamilton and myfelf are at 
ifliie is this i aflert and maintain that the matter of c was written in 
my pofleflion before i received b sir w hamilton holds me mif 
taken and thinks he can prove from the correfpondence that in this 
point my memory has failed this i continue to treat as irrelevant 
for we are both agreed that the corpus delisii if delisium there be lies 
in c containing fomething not fubflantially contained in a but fuffi 
cientiy hinted at in b any reader who thinks that c does contain 
fomething fuggefted by b which is not in a may declare againft the 
correbiefs of my memory any one who thinks the contrary will hold 
it of no confequence whether my memory on the difputed fal be good 
or bad with thef reader i have no cafe with the fecond i have 
all i think worth caring about 

sir w hamilton maintains my letters to be eflential parts of the 
cafe they may become fo as foon as it is pointed out what c contains 
which is hinted at in b and not contained in fubftance or principle in 
a when sir w hamilton points out by citation from c what he 
alleges to have been taken and by citation from b what he thinks it 
has been taken from and when i thereupon fail to produce equivalent 



 appendix 

knowledge from a or clfe to expofe the irrelevance of his citation from 
b — then thofe letters may become of importance this he has not done 
though fpecially challenged to do fo and when i come to difcufs iii 
and iv it ihall appear that he admits he has not done it 

i now give the beft account i can of the origin of the difpute pre 
mifing that up to this d of september do not abfolutely know 
what the fyftem is which i am charged with appropriating there is a 
fyftem which i think is moll probably the thing in queftion but a fyf 
tem containing a defeat of fo glaring a charadler that i will not attribute 
it to sir w hamilton who defcribes his own as adequately tefted 
and matured until he expreffly claims it or until i have the moll indu 
bitable proof 

in the common or ariflotelian propofition the quantities of the fub 
je£l and predicate are determined the lirll by exprejjion or implication 
the fecond by the nature of the copula fee page of this work and 
the only quantities confidered are alliafome the latter meaning any 
thing that not none may mean fome it may be all but not known to be 
all perhaps not more than one the matter contained in a fuggefled 
itfelf to me in the funmier of and was forwarded to cambridge 
with the reft of the memoir on the th of oftober 

i will now introduce sir w hamiltons defcription of the various 
kinds of quantity p 

 your statement is chiefly plaulible from a wretched confulion 

 of diftind things this confufion with which you delude yourfelfi 

 and many of your readers is of two independent fchemes of logical 

 quantification the one aflerting an increafe in the expreflly quantified 

 terms the other a minuter divifion of the forms of quantification itfelf 

 to dilintricate this entanglement we have fimply to confider in their 

 contrafts the three following fchemes of quantification — 

 the firft fcheme is that which logically — confines all exprefled 

 quantity to the subject prefuming the predicate to be taken — in 

 gative propolitions always determinately in its great eft and leaft ex 

 tenfion univerfally and iingularly in affirmative propoiitions always 

 indeterminately in fome part of its extenfion particularly 

 tiq fecond fcheme is that which logically extends the expreffion 

 of quantity to both the propofitional terms and allows the predicate to 

 be of any quantity in propolitions of either quality this not only 

 fupplies a capital defeft but affords a principle on which logic ob 

 tains a new and general development 

 the third fcheme is that which logically — admits more exprejfed 

 quantities than a determinately leaft or greateft extenfion quantity fin 

 gular and univerfal and an indeterminately partial extenfion quantity 

 particular this though it correls perhaps an omiffion yields no 
 principle for a general logical development 

 the firft dolrine is the common or ariftotelic the fecond is mine 

 and in the third — in fo far as you have gone and apart from the con 
 fideration of right or wrong — i do not queftion your originality 

 now the fecond and third fchemes are both oppofed to the firft 
 but in different refpefts confequently the fecond and third may each 



appendix 

 of them combine with itfelf either the whole other or that part of 

 the firft to which it is not itfelf oppofed more is impoffible 

 let the following be noted — tour old view that in the body of 

 the cambridge memoir is a combination of the rnikdfcheme ofquan 
 tification with the first your new view that in its addition is a 

 combination ofthemulufcheme of quantification with the second and 

 the confufion of which you are now guilty is the recent and uniform 

 and perverfe identification in your present statement of the second 

 fcheme with the third 

 before however proceeding to comment on your confufion of the 

 fecond and third fchemes i may alfo relieve a confiilion in the term 

 definite and its reverfe indefinite as applied to logical quantification 

 in the firft common or ariftotelic meaning definite y or more pre 

 cifely predefinite biokptog ffpofiopiar is equivalent to exprejed 

 overt y or more proximately to dejignate and predefignate s in this 

 fenfe definite quantity denotes exprejfed in oppofition to merely under 

 ftoody quantity 

 in hit fecond meaning that which i have always ufed and certain 

 ancients i find were before me definite is equivalent to determinately 

 marked out a fenfe in which definite quantity is extenfion undivided 

 or indivifibhy univerfal or fingular this including any colledled plu 

 rality of individuals as oppofed to particular quantity 

 in the third meaning which you have ufurped definite is equivalent 

 to numerically fpecified and in this fenfe a definite is an arithmetically 

 articulate quantity as oppofed to one arithmetically inarticulate — 

 this your meaning of the word i did not before the appearance of 

 your statement apprehend for of courfe i prefumed you to ufe it 

 in its firft or common meaning from which you never hint that you 

 confcioufly intend to deviate 

three fchemes of quantity are here mentioned 

firft the ordinary one 

secondly that in which the ordinary quantities alldxafome are ap 
plied in every way to both fubjeft and predicate 

thirdly that in which numerically definite quantity is applied to 
fubjedl or predicate or both the eifential diftindlion of this cafe is nume 
rical definitenefs it really contains the fecond fyftem when numerical 
•quantity is algebraically expreifed of thefe it appears sir w ha 
milton claims the fecond or rather the application of fuch a fcheme to 
the fyllogifm what then is it i fuppofe it to be the following my 
order of reference is xy 

 let the following alfo be noted — my old view that in the body of the cam 
bridge papor is entirely on jirji fcheme except in one digrejpve fedlion and one 
fubfequent paragraph from both of which a is quoted in which the ficond znd third 
are combined my next view that in the addition is alfo a combination of the fecond 
and third fchemes and my statement contained alfo a uniform but not recent 
identification of the cune fecond znd third fchemes which i never feparated in thought 
until i faw this paragraph any one who can form an opinion of the way in which 
the fubjedl would prefent itfelf to the mind of a mathematician will fee that the fecond 
fcheme would prefent itfelf concomitantly with and as an eflential part of the alge 
braical form of the third a de m

all x is till y means that x and y are identical it is my d all 
x is fome y is ai some x is all t is a some x is fome y is i 
as to negative propofitions all x is not all t is £ some x is not 
all t is oi all x is not fome t is o some x is not fome t is true 
of all pairs of terms one of which is plural in its indefinite fbrm it is 
what i have in chapter viii chltdifpurious 

the propofitions of this fyftem are then the complex d or aa 
the fix ariftotclian forms ai a ei oi o ii and the fpurious form 
which may be called u in looking over sept sir w hamiltons 
pamphlet i happened to light on the afiertion incidentally made that 
his fyftem gives thirtyfix valid moods in each figure on examining 
the preceding fyftem i find this to be the cafe i fhould not have pub 
lifhed the refults had not sir w hamilton made it neceflary for me 
to conmient on them i fhall denote the propofition u or some xs 
are not fome ys by x y and i fhall fuppofing each cafe to be formed 
in the firft figure then tranfpofe it into my own notation 

 there xt fifteen forms in which d enters whenever d is either 
of the premifes the other premife and conclulion agree thus wc have 
ajdai duu c c 

 fifteen ariftotelian forms ajaja aaa aiejei ejaei 
ajoo oa aooi oajo alj iiaji eo iieo 
aa i • aeio e a o 

 six more u fyllogifins aou oiaju auu uaju iu 
oiu 

the two things to be confidered are — the introduduon of the iden 
tical propofition and that of the fpurious one as i call it 

it is i fuppofe a fundamental rule of all formal logic that every pro 
pofition muft have its denial its contradiduon now d has no fimple 
contradiction in this fyftem that o and oi both contradid it and sdfo 
e is true but the mere contradiaion is the disjunction o or o 
a perfon who can fhow that one or the other of thcfe is true has de 
monftratively contradided d even though it could be proved impofiible 
to determine which of the two it is 

the propofition u is ufually fpurious but if we introduce it wc 
muft introduce its contradidory alfo now if either x or y be plural 
names it muft be true confequendy the contradiction of u is x and 
y are lingular names and x is y when a fyllogifm having the pre 
miie u is introduced either that premife may be contradicted or it may 
not if it may there is no form to do it in if it may not then it is a 
fpurious propofition and cannot by combination with others prove 
anything but a like fpurious concluiion 

let x y denote some xs are not fome ys and xy denote there 
is but one x and one y and x is y then either x y or xjy muft 
be true and one only a logical fyftem which admits one and not the 
other which contains an afiertion incapable of contradiction without 
going out of the fyftem can hardly be faid to be adequately tefted and 
matured and is not felfcomplete the propofition xy includes in 
itfelf the conditions of d and is a kind of ftngular form of d 



appendix 

i prefumc from the number of sir w hamiltons moods thirtyfixy 
as above obtained that the contradiduon neither of d nor of u finds a 
place admit them and the contradiftion of u alone call it v de 
mands iizteen new moods in each figure i will now proceed 

in my publication fpeaking now of a what was fent to cambridge 
before i communicated with sir w hamilton i had no quantification 
intermediate between the ordinary one and the numerical one applied 
to either fubjedl or predicate as wanted in the canon of the middle term 
there given look at the laft of the feven fyllogifms in xhafecond extrast 
where both the predicates being of the middle term are quantified and the 
condition of validity is quantitatively ftatcd but for yiy lefs than 
 fliould be readyy greater than i the equivalence of this 
to yiy lefs than i is a miftake in tkt jirft extrast the general 
canon is given which is afterwards ufed in c 

up to the time when sir w hamilton publilhed his letter in reply 
to my ftatement ii i never had feparated the idea of his fecond fcheme 
of quantification from that of the third 

thus then we flood on odlober when i fent my paper to cam 
bridge sir w hamilton had been teaching the application of the 
ordinary quantities to both fubjedt and predicate i had arrived at the 
algebraical reprefentation of the numerical quantification of terms whe 
ther fubjed or predicate matters not as long as they were middle terms 

 ohober my communication containing a was in the 
hands of dr whewell as he informs me for tranfmiffion to the cam 
bridge society i never faw it again till the next february october 
 sir w hamilton wrote to me in anfwer to an application of mine 
on the hiftory of the fyllogifm further informing me that he taught an 
extenfion and amplification of its theory which he offered to commu 
nicate november the offer having been accepted sir w ha 
milton forwarded the communication b which i give entire confifling 
of a letter and the requifites which he had furnifhed to his iludents 
for a prize eflay december he wrote again forwarding a printed 
profpesius of his intended work on logic this is not material for 
on receiving it i thought certain what from the previous communica 
tion i had thought poffible that sir w hamilton was in pofteffion of 
the theory of numerically definite fyllogifms but this was a miflake of 
mine as will prefently appear i accordingly to preferve my own 
rights immediately forwarded as will prefently be flated more in de 
tail an identifying defcription of the fheets of paper on which my nu 
merical theory was written and an account of both my fyftems in 
letters dated december and january i of this sir 
w hamilton who has publifhed both letters is my witnefs 
february i dted the addition to the proof fheet of my cambridge 
paper which was defpatched to cambridge the next day this addi 
tion contains c which itfelf contains in fubftance all that part of my 
letter of january i which refers to the difputed point march sir 
w hamilton wrote the letter containing the charge of plagiarifm hav 
ing been for two months prevented by illnefs from refuming the fubjedi

all fubfequcnt correfpondencc referred to proceedings and not to the 
fubjeft matter of the charge 

many days before the middle of oftober i had applied the fyftem of 
quantification in the manner hewn in c sir w hamilton thinks my 
memory has failed here i know better my memory does not depend 
upon a date but upon the opening of the univerfity collegp seifion 
which takes place in the middle of odlober but it matters nothing 
for the notion of the complete quantification of a predicate when wanted 
becaufe it is the middle term will prove the pofleffion of that procefs as 
well as quantification in all cafes whether wanted or not on receiving 
b i looked with curiofity at ® on which in faft sir w hamilton 
grounds his declaration of having made a communication he demands 
of his pupils 

 the reafons why common language makes an ellipfis of the exprejfed 
quantity frequently of the fubjes and more frequently of the predicate 
though both have always their quantities in thought 

on looking at this and feeing mention of the quantities which the 
terms have in thought in common language i took it for granted that 
the common quantities were fpoken of namely that of the fubjeft horn 
the tenor of the propofition that of the predicate from the nature of the 
copula i never fhould have imagined that in the common language of 
common people there were any other quantities even if in their minds 
the predicate have thefe had this been all i fhould have pafled it over 
as referring to common quantities and making common people a little 
more oi logicians as to the predicate than i have found them to be 
that this common language meant the language of any fcientific fyftem i 
had not the leaft idea ftill lefs that it referred to the language of the 
writers own unprinted fyftem current only between himfelf and his 
hearers and though i gained a fufpicion that sir w hamilton might 
have which he had not adopted numerical quantification it was not 
from this paftage which by itfelf was nothing but from what is now 
coming which made this paftage ambiguous 

on looking further into b which fee i found that sir williams 
fyftem whatever it might be noted defels in the converfion ofpropofi 
tions and a general canon of fyllogifm now i had two fyftems each 
of which had its own way of adding to the converfions and each its 
own canon of fyllogifm in my firit fyftem which has now grown into 
chapter v the permanent introduduon of the contranominals is a com 
pletion of converfion and the redudlion by the remarks in pages 
c of all fyllogifms to univerfal affirmative premifes was the canon of 
fyllogifm in the fecond feen in a and c which has grown into 
chapter viii there is the univerfality of fimple converfion and the 
canon of the middle term sir w hamilton may deny i believe he 
does that thefe are canons let it be fo but i took them for canons 
and thought of them when i faw the word canon in his fummary and 
then the quefuon was had sir w hamilton one of thefe fyftems or a 
third one i had been throughout our correfpondencc well pleafed with 
the idea that i had hit upon fomething in common with sir w ha 
milton and in my anfwer to communication b i faid 



appendix 

 i am not at all clear that i fliall not have to claim only ccondary 

 originality on feveral points when i fee defefts of the common 
dodlrine of converfion and a fupremc canon of categorical fyuo 

 gifm i muft wait for further information i think i may yet be 

 able to flatter myfelf that i have followed you in fome points unknow 
ingly 

the reader will obferve that this inftru£uve communication is fup 
pofed to tell me that in my thoughts the predicate has all kinds of 
quantity though in truth bothohave their quantities is not englifh for 
either may have any one of two pedes of quantity sir w hamilton 
has exprefled perhaps the dilum which is to have taught me new 
quantification in terms of that new quantification unknowii by both 
have quantities he feems to aflert that he meant both have all quantities 
that both have their quantities is true in the conmion fyftem thefe 
words which exprefs a truth of the common fyftem sir w hamilton 
declares to be a fure mode of communicating the difierenc between his 
fyftem and the common one this may do in his own icdlure room 
in which he has the arbitrium et jus et norma hquendi in his own 
hands a diftinduvely unmeaning phrafe may in virtue of his expla 
nations pafs current between him and his pupils and a private bank 
of courfe muft receive its own notes but they are not lawful tender 
anywhere nor good tender out of the neighbourhood 

i fliall now proceed to the letters in the athenaeum iii and iv 
thefe contain the iflues raifed by the pamphlets my fliort letter con 
tains the ftrength of my cafe i am to prefunie that my opponents 
letter contains the ftreagth of his anfwer and i think it does fo at

quite fatisfied with your own an 
fwer to your pwn charge 

there is nothing left which i 
care to difcufs with you our 
views of logic their coincidences 
their differences their firft dates 
my memory c i am content to 
leave to thofe who will read my 
ftatement and your letters with 
two remarks 

there is no ftrength in an abandoned pofition my pamphlet was 
publiihed in defence of my own character when sir wm hamilton 
retraced his charge of breach of confidence and falfe dealing there was 
nothing to which i flood engaged nothing i cared to write feparate 
pamphlets on efpecially when the approach of this prefent publication 
was confidered any one who reads page of my pamphlet in which 
the promife was made will fee that it has reference to what i there call 
the infamy which would attach to any one who had deferved the 
terms he ufed for the conduft he defcribcd i certainly forgot to fay 
 unlefs you retraft but as he had already refufed to retradl though 
he had propofed to jufpend the charge provided i would then undergo 
an examination it did not enter into my head to provide for fuch a con 
tingency the affertions about weaknefs misflatement c are for the 
readers judgment i did not in this letter allude expreflly to sir w 
hamiltons various infinuations that the old charge might be true both 
becaufe at the firfl hurried reading i did not become aware of their 
extent and alfo becaufe i wifhed to take time before i made up my 
mind as to the way of treating what i faw of them 



mr de morgan 

i as foon as the queflion of 
character was difpofed of it was 
your bufinefs to fhow that my ad 
dition written after i communi 
cated with you contained fome 
principle not contained in my me 
moiry written before i communi 
cated withj you this you do 
not do you aflert and you de 
fcribe and you fum up but you do 
not quote — except a few words 
which are not in that part of my 
memoir which i declared to con 
tain the principles ufed in my 
addition 



sir w hamilton 

you do not deny that your cor 
refpondence aflerts a claim to the 
principle communicated to you by 
me but you complain that i have 
not fhown that your addition in 
volves a new dolrine uncontained 
in that part from the overt con 
tradidlions of its other parts i had 
of your memoir which you de 
clared to contain the principles 
ufed in your addition and this 
you can fay when i explicitly 
flated that throughout the whole 
paper the memoir not only is 
there much in contradidlion — there 



• here given in c f here given in a fo far as relevant 

x sir w hamilton part of this is b 



appendix 

is abfolutely nothing in more then 
fortuitous conformity with the 
theory of a quantified predicate 
l p this too you can 
fay whilft before your eyes unan 
ffveredf there was lying ray for 
mal requefiy that you would point 
out any pajfage of your previous 
writings in which this dodlrine 
that asterted in your statementy 
of a quantification of the middle 
term be it fubjeft or predicate is 
contained ibid — for could find 
none and none has by you been 
indicated 

i do deny in one fenfe that my correfpondence aflerts a claim to the 
principle communicated by sir w hamilton for i deny that he com 
municated any principle i prefume of courfe that the profpeftus and 
letter fent on the th of december are out of the queftion fince i 
gave the fyftem on which the charge was made by return of poll sir 
w hamilton has very properly confined himfelf in his pamphlet to 
his communication b of november as containing the communica 
tion which he afferts me to have ufed let the reader look through it 
and ajfk himfelf what new principle is communicated and where 

sir w hamilton aflerts that he has ftiown my addition to contain 
a new doctrine not contained in one definite part of my memoir y by the 
contradidions of its other parts let p q r be parts of a memoir 
and s an addition by fhowing that p and qcontradift one another 
sir w hamilton thinks he fhows that s contains a doctrine not in 
volved in r the fad is that all my memoir except sedlion iii on 
the quantity of propofitions and one other paragraph from both which 
a is taken belongs to the fyflem of chapter v in this work while 
seduon iii the other paragraph and the addition belong to chapter 
viii let the reader take notice that sir w haniilton who by the 
way feems to confider i explicitly flated as a fufficient anfwer to 
you have not fhown does nd fomething in my memoir in conformity 
with the theory of a quantified predicate he fays it is fortuitous 
but it did not feem to him requifite to bring it forward and point out 
its fort uitoufnefs this point is for the reader to judge of how 
dare you he fays rob me of my quantified predicate good sir 
i anfwer i had it before i knew you what if you had he 
replies it is enough if i inform you that it was only by accident 

sir w hamilton cannot find either in the memoir or the addition 
he fays here only in the previous writings but in his pamphlet p 
he flates it of both memoir and addition any thing about the dolrine 
of quantification of the middle term whether it be fubjedl or predicate 
which doftrine he fays repugnant to all that is there taught it is 



o appendix 

true that in the next fentence he refers to previous toritings as cited i 
will therefore conclude that sir william included the addition by mis 
take and meant the memoir only whether my section iii a is or 
is not full of quantification of the middle term without reference to 
whether that middle term be fubjeft or predicate i am quite content to 
leave to the reader sir w hamilton fays he cannot find it this i 
believe and wonder at but it does not follow that it is not there let 
the reader look 

m 

again when sir w hamilton averted that c contains fomething 
which i got from him and which is therefore not in a i repeat that 
he ought to have pointed out what it is his afiertion that he cannot 
find it in a neither proves that it not in a nor that it in c 

this is the pinch which obliged him to write fortyfour pages of r 
eufation in anfwer to fixteen of defence and this is the point on which 
the queilion will finally turn i am tedioufly often obliged to bring 
the whole matter to its abc but what elie can i do with an oppo 
nent who writes an ignoratio elenchi of fortyfour pages long 

sir w hamilton is not good at finding inmiediately after what 
he has quoted from himfelf as above comes the following paflage — 

 in regard to your third aftertion that perfestly definite quantifica 

 tion defiroys the necejfity of diftinguifiing jfuljeb and predicate this 

 is altogether a miflake it is not definite quantification in what 

 ever fenfe the word definite be employed but the quantification of both 
 the terms which deftroys the neceflity of diftinguifhing fubjeft and 
 predicate and this by fhowing that propofitions are merely equations 

 and enabling us to convert them ai—fimply 

i now quote from myfelf of the two sentences now coming sir 
w hamilton quotes the firft omits the fecond which fhows that my 
phrafe perfebly definite means definite in both terms and then makes 
the preceding remark 

 in fad perfectly definite quantification deftroys the neceflity of dif 

 tinguifhing fubjeft and predicate to fay that iomc xs out of 

 are all to be found among ys or that out of xs are out of 

 ys is precifely the fame thing as faying that out of ys are 

 out of xs 

in a writer of whom difhoneft intention might be concluded we 
fhould know how to explain the omiflion of the fecond fentence but 
there is no diihonefty in sir w hamilton the omiffion muft be 
referred to the fame difpofition which prevents him from feeing quan 
tification of the middle term in a what i take that difpofition to be 
matters nothing to my reader perhaps this fentence alone will enable 
fome to deteft that i had not any idea of the fecond fyftem ofquantifi 
tion independently of the third

done this — and even then you 
will have to ihow that your com 
munication was intelligible 

in glancing over my letters and 
the mafs of notes which you have 
written on them i fee that i have 
feveral times ufed inaccurate lan 
guage as people do in hurried let 
ters still more often you have 
mifunderftood me if my occa 
iional inaccuracy and your occa 
iional mifunderftanding fhould be 
held to furnifh fome excufe for you 
when you precipitately charged me 
with diflionourable conduft i ihall 
be better pleafed than not 



nication was intelligible you 
forget that it is for you to explain 
how having fubfcribed toi as 
having rightly undfrjioodi twen 
tytwo fentences of my profpeftus 
l pp you could fubfe 
quently declare that communica 
tion to be unintelligible l p 
 i have now no doubt how 
ever that you then fubfcribed 
to more fentences than by you 
were rightly underllood in 
deed had you only betimes avowed 
that all you had fubfcribed to as 
rightly underftood was to you 
really unintelligible and that the 
repetition of my dodbine was in 
your mouth mere empty found 
two pamphlets might have ealily 
been ipared 



firft the profpebus is not the communication the communica 
tion is that of november b let the reader look at it and fee 
whether it be intelligible communication of new principle 

in my pamphlet have feveral times fpoken of the conmiunication 
though there were two this was natural enough inafmuch as there 
was one communication that of nov on which the charge was made 
againu which that pamphlet was a defence sir wm hamilton has 
never ventured to maintain that i derived anything from the communi 
cation of dec containing the profpedhis to which i replied on the 
evening i received it as prefently mentioned but he makes in various 
places of which the above is one a mixture of the two communica 
tions 

secondly i have looked carefully at pages and of sir wm 
hamiltons letter and at all the refl of otlr correfpondence without find 
ing that i have ever admitted that i fubfcribed to any part of the prof 
peftus as by me rightly underflood page is no doubt a mifprmt 
for i have neither found nor have i the flightefl remembrance of 
any fubfcription of mine to any thing sir wm hamilton ever wrote as 

rightly underflood 

i repeat the account given in my pamphlet of the manner in which i 
fubfcribed to this profpeftus — 

 the next communication is dated dec and confifled of — i a 

 letter a printed profpedhis of sir william hamiltons intended 
 work on logic nothing turns on this for the fimple reafon that my 

 anfwer contained the mofl exprefs and formal proof that come by it 

 how i might i was then in the mofl complete written pofteflion of all 

 i have fince publifhed the profpedus which accompanied this letter

 o appendix 

 is very full on the refults which sir william hamilton can produce 

 from his principles but gives nothing i think certainly nothing intel 

 ligible to me on thofe principles themfelves 

 as foon as i faw thefe refults i inftantly faw that many of them 

 agreed with my own i had then no doubt that we poflefted fomething 

 in common and i faid fo very diftinftly in my reply as the reader 

 will prefently fee this firft impreffion has not been confirmed feeling 

 it now time to fecure whatever of independent difcovery might belong 

 to me i anfwered sir william hamilton in two letters dated decem 

 ber and january i in thefe letters — 

 i i returned the printed profpedhis with the refults underlined 

 which my fyflem would produce 

 i ftated that i had a fyftem written on certain fheets of paper 

 which i defcribed as to number fize c adding the head words of 

 each page i felt inclined to get the fignature of fome good witnefs put 

 upon thefe papers but at the fame time i felt reluftant that sir wil 

 liam hamilton ihould fee if it ever became neceffary to produce thefe 

 papers that i had been taking precautions againft him i therefore de 

 termined to make himfelf my witnefs 

 i flated diflindlly the firft principles of both my fyftems and the 

 fyllogiftic formulae to which they lead 

thirdly i fubftantiate the above fo far as the fubfcription is con 
cerned by quoting two paffages from sir w hamiltons publication 
of my letter of december 

 i received your obliging communication this morning and am now 

 fully fatisfied that i have in one of my views of fyllogifm arrived at 

 your views in fubftance or fomething fo like them that i could fub 

 fcribe in my own fenfe to a great part of your paper this 

 chapter meaning the one on the fheets of paper above referred to 

 i might exprefs in your words wherever they are underlined in the 
 profpeftus which i returti hoping you will fend another 

where are thofe words rightly underftood which sir w ha 
milton attributes to me three times in one paragraph 

he muft have been quoting from memory seeing bis refults i 
found they were alfo my refults s io i told him that i could fubfcribe 
and i cannot find i have ufed this word more than once and it is in 
page referred to by sir william in my own fenfe to a great part 
of his paper if words can fpeak meaning i here tell him that i 
fubfcribe in my own fenfe leaving it to the future to fhow whether i 
fubfcribe in his that is whether i underfland him rightly 

i was reading this for the prefs when i found out the words which 
applied in one fenfe hypothetically to one of his refults sir w hamilton 
has transferred in a different fenfe to all one of his refults fpeaking 
of the moods is the eftablifhment of their numerical equality under 
all the figures the italics being his i could not make out the englifh 
of this the others i underfiood in the grammatical fenfe for ex 
ample the abrogation of the fpecial laws of fyllogifm is intelligible 
i did not know whether my fenfe of thefe words that is to fay my 



appendix 

abrogation of thofe laws was the fame as sir w hamiltons ftill that 
he did abrogate certain laws was clear but numerical equality of moods 
i could only underftand as referring to the numerical quantities which 
i fuppofed the reader will remember that i fent back the profpeftus by 
the next poft and had little time to look at it sir w hamiltons fyftem 
to contain it means i find that there are the fame number of moods 
in all figures but to attribute numerical equality to different things is a 
mode of faying that there is the fame number of them in different fets to 
which i was unaccuftomed having however as i thought divined 
what the englifh of this might mean i underlined it adding as sir w 
hamilton ftates in one of the footnotes which i never remarked till 
now thefe words if i underftand this rightly i may underline it i 
think i meant if i can make out the zvords this underftand 
rightly sir w hamilton adlually takes from this fentence joins it to 
my fubfcription mentioned in another document and reprefents me 
as declaring that i have fubfcribed to as rightly underftood twentytwo 
fentences c and himfelf as quoting from one paffage 

but had i betimes avowed my nonunderftanding two pamphlets 
might have been fpared where are we now i did avow my not un 
derftanding the firft communication and my fubfcribing to the fecond 
in my own fenfe to which sir w hamilton fubfequently anfwered 
to the effeft that i fpoke falfe that i did underftand the firft for that 
i had fent him in letters written immediately after the fecond was 
received his fundamental dolrine and many of its moft important 
confequences what have i been contending for all along except 
that the dodlrine of his firft communication was to me mere empty found 
and that all i was able to produce when i received xht fecond was my 
own but sir w hamilton adually gives me a right to fay with 
reference to the fecond the more developed and more intelligible com 
munication that i did not underftand it infifts upon my faying it and 
reproaches me for not faying it well then to ufe a scottifh phrafe 
the lefs i lie when i fay i did not underftand the firft which is the 
point at iftue so that as to the matter of our controverfy sir w ham 
ilton admits that there was fortuitous he calls it entrance of the theory 
of the quantified predicate in my writings prior to his communications 
and as to the conduft of it he admits that i did not underftand his 
communication and in the face of faft reproaches me with maintain 
ing that i did till after the pamphlets were written when it was of the 
eftence of my fbtement firft that i did not underftand fecondly that 
neither i nor any one elfe could have underftood fave only the pupils 
to whpm the requifites were addrefted 

mr de morgan sir w hamilton

difcover them to be true the reft

one retort from me on the fame

forming new words and as is 
hit you put your own image and

age i think you have got into 
the habit of aftuming the fame 
authority over that already exifting 
portion of our language which is 
conmionly faid to belong to the 
queen — and that you need an in 
terpreter if i can arrive at your 
meaning by the time i write the 
preface to my work on logic i 
will ftate your claim accompanied 
by your own words if not i can 
ftill ftate your own words till 
then i have nothing more to fay 



appendix 



when your excufable irritation 
has fubftded you will fee that i 
could only iecure you from a ver 
di of plagiarifm by brining you 
in as fufiering under an illuiion 
what however is all in all — my 
criticifms will not i think be 
found untrue 

if guilty of lefe majelty by re 
ference to the queens englifti 
have i not my accufer as abettor 
for you not only pafted my min 
tages quantify and quantification 
as current coin but in borrow 
ing aftually thanked me for the 
words l p however 
my verbal innovations are at leaft 
not elementary blunders i do 
not for example confound a term 
with a proportion the middle with 
the conclufion of a fyllogifnu 



sir w hamilton unconfcioufly adapts his language to a very true 
fuppolition namely that he has in his pamphlet made himfelf the jury 
in this cafe he is unfortunate about the mintage i fay to him you 
make new words well but i am afraid you alter the old ones to 
which he replies why you thanked me for my new words so i did 
and fo i do again but what has that to do with the lefe majefty part 
of my inftnuation 

sir w hamilton fays that i have fomewhere where he does not 
fay ufed term for proportion middle for conclufon collebively for dif 
tributively this may be fuch flips of the pen are common enough 
he fets them down as blunders of ignorance i am not afraid the 
reader will follow him he ought to have faid where they occur that 
is when he firft mentioned them in his pamphlet till i put thefe 
letters together i was fatisfied on sir wm hamiltons ftatement that 
i had done all thefe enormities but now after the cafe of rightly 
underftood which i have juft had to difcufs i do not feel fo well fatif 
fied 

sir w hamilton 

finally i beg leave to remind you — there is now evidence in your 
pofleflion that for feven years at leaft the doftrine of a quantified pre 
dicate has been puclickly taught by me whilft on your part there is 
a counter aitertion or innuendo which as you cannot prove it concerns 
your chamber formally to annul 

i never denied that sir w hamilton had taught a doftrine of the 
quantified predicate by the time i wrote my pamphlet i was pretty 



appendix 

fure that it was not the fame as mine sir w hamiltons anfwer 
confirmed me in this as appears in page 

i now come to mention a part of the difcuflion which i fhould per 
haps have omitted if i had not pledged myfelf in my pamphlet to give 
an account of a certain offer which i there made to sir william ham 
ilton in the event of that offer not being accepted it is a curious 
inftance of that difpofition to hold a correfpondent or an opponent 
capable of folving enigmas and bound to do it which appears in his 
prefuming that fee b paragraph ° an obfcure reference to what is 
done in common language would enable me to guefs at the uncommon 
language of his fyftem and his ledlures i infert it alfo as a fpecimen 
of the various mifunderftandings and mifapprehenfions which sir w 
hamilton imputes to me referring to a matter which readers will fepa 
rately comprehend had i fpace or inclination to deal with them all 
i believe i could ferve them all in the fame way 

o i learnt from sir wm hamilton that his doftrine 
had obtained confiderable publicity through the notes and ejfays of his 
ftudents in my reply referring to this fyftem and to his offer of 
communicating it i afked if he had a pupil whom he could truft with 
the conmiunication the anfwer was b prefently given but dec in 
fending the profjpiedhis sir w hamilton informed me that before 
forwarding it the firft communication in which that he had other than 
ariftotelian quantification was intelligibly announced he had waited for 

a reply from mr that gentleman continues sir w 

hamilton in words fome of which i place in italics was a pupil of 

 mine £x years ago and obtained one of the higheft honours of the clafs 

 he was therefore fully competent to afford you information which i 

 begged him to do in regard to my logical dodlrines as they were taught 

 fo far back i knew him to be a graduate of your college and he tells 

 me that he was for three years a pupil of your own if you are ftill 
 interefted in the matter you can therefore obtain from him as an 

 acquaintance what information yoii wifh more agreeably than from a 

 ftranger when he attended me befides the twofold wholes in which 

 the fyllogifm proceeds the quantification of the predicate and the effeft 

 of that on the doftrine of converiion on the dodbine of iyllogiflic 

 moods on the fjpecial fyuogiftic rules c were topics dif cuffed and 

 partly given out for exercifes they were in fail then mere common 

 place 

jan mr called on me at univerfity college after 

an evening lefture of mine put his notes into my hands and has fince 
flated in which i have no doubt he is correft though i do not remem 
ber it that he informed me he toas doubtful whether they contained 
exactly what i wanted and that he would gladly furnifh any additional 
information now i conceived as i thought it was intended by sir 
w hamilton i fhould do that the notes of one of the beft fludents 
even if not exadlly what i wanted were fure to contain fomething of 
the mere commonplace by which i took to be meant the ordinary matter 
of the ledures which was dif cuffed and given out as exercifes to thofe 



 appendix 

who attended but in thefe notes i found nothing on quantification i 
had now this key word which did not appear in the main communica 
tion b differing from what is ufuai and after expreffing this in my 
pamphlet i proceeded as follows 

 but if there really be anything in which sir william hamilton has 

 preceded me i fhall be of all men except himielf moft interelled in 
 his having his full rights and i make him this offer and will take his 
 acceptance of it as reparation in full for his fufpicions and aflertions 
 with the confent of the gentleman to whom thefe notes belong which 

 i am fure will not be refiifed to our joint application i will forward to 

 him a copy of their table of contents having more than a hundred and 

 mty headings from thefe sir william hamilton fhall feleft thofe 
which are in his opinion fure to contain proof of his priority on any 

 point which i have invefligated of thefe i will have copies made and 
 fent to him and will print in the work on logic which i am preparing 
 and in fome one part of it the parts which he fhall feleft as fit to 
 prove or to fhow that he coixld prove let him call it as he likes his 

 cafe or the germs of his cafe as he pleafes again provided always 

 that the matter fhall not run beyond fome eight or a dozen odlavo pages 
 of fmall print and i on my part propofe that i fhall be allowed to 

 print to onehalf the amount felefted by sir william hamilton of ad 

 ditional extraft but if this be refiifed i will not infifl on it with this 

 i will put a heading fully defcriptive of the reafon and meaning of the 
 infertion and fuch diflinft reference and account at the beginning of 

 the prefece as fhall be fure to call the readers attention to it so that 

 my book fhall eflablifh the claim if it can be eflablifhed from the notes 

 of one of the befl ftudents if this offer be not accepted an account of 

 it will take the place of any other refult if sir william hamilton or 
 any one elfe can propofe anything to make this offer fairer i fhall pro 

 bably not be found indifpofed to accept the addition and though i 

 will frankly fay my prefent convition is that the acceptance of the 
 offer would alone caufe my work to knock sir william hamiltons 
 affertions to atoms yet i will pledge myfelf in any cafe to abide by it 

had our places in this difcufson been changed i fhould have taken 
care that no reader of my anfwer fhould have been left in ignorance of 
fo fair an offer on the part of my opponent more efpecially if that 
opponent had been accufed by me of fraud and falfehood in a manner 
which i felt obliged formally to retradl but sir wm hamilton does 
not notice the offer even by an allufion and refers to the notes in the 
following way 

 in regard to mr — and his notes i beg leave to fay that in 

 my relative letters neither to that gentleman nor to you did i ever 

 refer to his notes of my leftures but exclufively to his perfonal infor 

 mation in regard to them and for a fufficient reafon the paragraphs 

 on logic dictated to and taken down by my fhidents on which i after 

 wards preled were written fo far back as the year and prior to 

 many of my new views and to the whole dodrine of a quantified predi 

 cate thefe views as developed were and are introduced in a great 



appendix 

 meafure as correlions of the common dodrine in the older notes 

 efjpecially they may therefore not appear in the didlated and numbered 

 paragraphs at all whilft frequently particularly at firft they were 
 given out as data on wliich previous to farther comment the ftudents 
 were called on or excited to write expolitory eflays i diftindlly recol 
 left that in the seffion during which mr — — attended my courfe of 

 logic it was required on the hypothelis of a quantified pre 

 dicate — to ftate in detail the valid moods of each fyllogilfic figure and 

 i further diftinlly recolleft that mr was one of thofe who 

 eitayed this problem if wrong on this point i fhall admit that my 

 memory is as treacherous as yours it was indeed quite natural that 

 mr fhould give and that you hould receive his notes but 

 of courfe you could have fought or obtained no perfonal information 

 from him in reference to the point in queflion without mentioning the 

 faft were it however requifite to give proof from notes of fo 

 manifefl a faft i doubt not that fcores of fludents would be willing to 

 place theirs at my difpofal 

on the appearance of sir w hamiltons pamphlet mr 

wrote him a very flraightforward letter of which he fent me a copy 
with permiffion to both of us to ufe it the general tenor is that sir 
w hamilton is corredl in his flatements of what he had taught which 
flatements i never impugned as to faft i did not know what they 

meant on the point in queflion mr fays the italics are 

mine — 

during the seffion in which i attended your leftures and 
 your new fyftem bafed on the thorough going quantification of 
 the predicate the fecond of the three fyflems mentioned in page of 
 your publifhed letter and its confequences in making all propofitions 

 fimply convertible c was not developed by you in your ordinary feries 
 of lectures i believe it was not touched upon in them but it was partly 

 explained to the clafs verbally and then given out as afubjeiifor ef 
fays when the eftays were given in they were read aloud in the clafs 

 and commented upon by you and in fo doing you fully explained the 
 fyflem as a fiill extenfion and thereby a complete fimplification of the 

 fylldgiftic theory 

 thefe fads which were flrongly fixed in my memory becaufe i 
 believe on that occafion i happened to be the only eftayifl who had 

 rightly apprehended and worked out the thefis will account for the 

 circumflance that my notes which were originally taken in fhorthand 

 although containing a full report of all your ordinary leftures are 

 completely filent on the fubjeft 

the reader may find out if he can where sir w hamilton re 
ferred to perfonal information s difunguifhed from notes or to his 
teaching of his new fyflem as a matter diftinft from that of his ordinary 
leftures and mufl judge what his fuccefs is in faying what he means 

 i think this fhould be extempore meaning that sir w hamilton ufually reads his 
ledhires 



 appendix 

to fay and he may find out further how i was to guefs that the 
mere commonplace of the topics dif cuffed in sir williams teaching was to 
come after an interval of fix years from his old pupils perfonal infor 
mation and not from the fiiu and as i found them excellent notes which 
he made at the time 

i fhould add that mr fubfequently to the printed contro 

verfy anfwered every query which i put to him on sir w hamiltons 
fyftem but did not feel juftified as in a like cafe i fliould not either in 
anfwering pofitively as to the minute details of it after laying it by for 
years 

i have mentioned one or two inftances in which as feems to me 
sir w hamilton has a ftrange idea of the fenfe of his own words i 
will now take one of the cafes in which he has dealt as ftrangely with 
mine the way in which we ufe language is one of the means which 
the reader has for forming his judgment on the whole of this difpute 
and he muft decide which of us is incapable of giving to the phrafes of 
the other their proper fignification 

when i returned to sir w hamilton his profpehis with thofe 
parts underlined which i could interpret in my own fenfe the more 
important parts relating to logical mood and figure were not thus un 
derlined in the accompanying letter i ufed thefe words to mood 
and figure i have attended but little what i get on thefe points will 
be from your hint or from your book the whole letter was on what 
i had done in the way of inveftigation not of elementary reading and 
i may fafely fay that it is clear i meant that i had not made mood and 
figure as conftituent parts of a theory of fyuogifm fubjedls of inveftiga 
tiony with a view to new properties but sir w hamilton in two 
places makes me avow ignorance of the ordinary fyftem of mood and 
figure in a footnote to the above he fays and yet though con 
 fefledly to feek in the very alphabet of the fcience mr de morg 
 would be a logical inventor what is here acknowledged in terms h 
fufficiently manifefted from miftakes and in his pamphlet irp 
 he reprefents me as no proficient — no thorough ftudent — in thi 
fcience and refers to this paragraph of mine as the ground of the 
aflertion it would have been ftrange if avowing ignorance of the 
ordinary doftrine of mood and figure i had faid that what i ftiould get 
on thefe points muft be from sir w hamiltons hint or unpublifhed 
book when any ordinary treatife would have given it fo ftrange that 
this claufe ought i think to have fuggefted the obvious meaning is 
sir w hamiltons interpretation a fair one i do not doubt that he 
meant it to be fair what i afk is has he the power to read fairly as 
well as the will 

the two preceding cafes that of the notes and that of the avowed 
ignorance are fpecimens of sir w hamiltons give and take of the 



• sir w hamilton fhould have cited a few but when he declares i have made 
elementary blunders he does not give io much as a reference the plan is a fafe one

section iii on the quantity of propofitions 

 the logical ufe of the word fome as merely more than none 
needs no further explanation exai knowledge of the extent of a pro 
pofition would coniift in knowing for inftance in fome xs are not ys 
both what proportion of the xs are fpoken of and what proportion 
exifts between the whole number of xs and of ys the want of this 
information compels us to divide the exponents of our proportion into 
o more than o not neceflarily i and i an algebraill learns to con 
fider the diftindion between o and quantity as identical for many 
purpofes with that between one quantity and another the logician 
muft all writers imply keep the diftindion between o and a however 
fmall a may be as facred as that between o and i — a there being but 
the fame form for the two cafes we fliall now fee that this matter 
has not been fidly examined 

 inference muil confift in bringing each two things which are to be 
compared into comparifon with a third many comparifons may be 
made at once but there muft be this procefs in every one when the 
comparifon is that of identity of is or not it can only be in its ulti 
mate or individual cafe one of the two following — this x is a y 
this z is the very fame y therefore this x is this z or elfe this x 
isa y this z is not the very fame y therefore this x is not this z 
and colledively it muft be either each of thefe xs is a y each of 
thefe ys is a z therefore each of thefe xs is a z or elfe each f 
thefe xs is a y no one of thefe ys is a z therefore no one of thefe 
xs is a z 

 all that is eflential then to a fyllogifm is that its premifes ftiall 
mention a number of ys of each of which they ftiall affirm either that 
it is both x and z or that it is one and is not the other the pre 
mifes may mention more but it is enough that this much can be picked 
out and it is in this laft procefs that inference conftfts 

 ariftotle noticed but one way of being fure that the fame ys are 
fpoken of in both premifes namely by fpeaking of all of them in one 
at leaft but this is only a cafe of the rule for all that is neceftary is 
that more ys in number than there exifi feparate ysfldll be fpoken of in 
both premifes together having to make greater than unity when 
neither m nor n is fo he admitted only that cafe in which one of the 
two m or n is unity and the other is anything except o here then 
are two fy uogifms which ought to have appeared but do not 



 appendix 



moll of the ys are xs moft of the ys are xs 

moft of the ys are zs moft of the ys are not zs 



 some xs are zs some of the xs are not zs 

and inftead of moft or of the ys may be fubftituted any two 
fraftions which have a fum greater than unity if thefe fraftions be m 
and n then the middle term is at leaft the fraftion r— i of the ys 
it is not really even neceflary that all the ys fhould enter in one pre 
mifs or the other for more than the fra£lion mn — i of the whole 
may be repeated twice 

 and in truth it is this mode of fyllogifing that we are frequently 
obliged to have recourfe to perhaps more often than not in our uni 
verfal fyllogiims all men are capable of fome inftruftion all who 
are capable of any inftrufuon can learn to diftinguifti their right and left 
hands by name therefore all men can learn to do fo let the word 
all in thefe two cafes mean only all but one and the books on logic tell 
us with one voice that the fyllogifm has particular premifcs and no con 
clujion can be drawn but in faft idiots are capable of no inftruftion

wholes or quantities in which a fyllogifm is caft i had intended fend

rate to have drawn up but i have not as yet been able to write this 
i will fend it wheti it is done from what you ftate of your fyftem 
having little in common with the old one and from the contents of 
your firft notions we ihall not i find at all interfere for my dodlrine 
is limply that of ariftotle fully developed 

it wul give me great pleafure if i can be of any ufe in your invefti 
gations concerning the hiftory of logical dolrines i have paid great 
attention to this fubjedl on which i found that i could obtain litde or 
no information from the profeffed hiftorians of logic and my collec

but as i mentioned to you in my former letter it is only in fubordinate

lafty and which papers though i hold it immaterial i affert to have 

been written before i received any logical communication from sir 

william hamilton to be compared with the extracts given in a 

 since this paper was written i found that the whole theory of the 
fyllogifm might be deduced from the confideration of propofitions in a 
form in which definite quantity of aftertion is given both to the fubjedl 
and the predicate of a propofition i had committed this view to 
paper when i learned from sir william hamilton of edinburgh that 



appendix 

he had for fome time paft publicly taught a theory of the fyuogifm 
diflfering in detail and extent from that of arillotle from the pro 
fpeftus of an intended work on logic which sir william hamilton has 
recently iflued at the end of his edition of reid as well as from infor 
mation conveyed to me by himfelf in general terms i ihould fuppofe it 
will be found that i have been more or lefs anticipated in the view juft 
alluded to to what extent this has been the cafe i cannot now 
afcertain but the book of which the profpedlus juft named is an 
announcement will fettle that queftion from the extraordinary extent 
of its authors learning in the hiftory of philofophy and the acutenefs of 
his written articles on the fubjel all who are interefted in logic will 
look for its appearance with more than common intereft 

 the footing upon which we ihould be glad to put propofitions if 
our knowledge were minute enough is the following we ihould ftate 
how many individuals there are under the names which are the fubjeft 
and predicate and of how many of each we mean to fpeak thus 
inftead of some xs are ys it would be every one of a fpecified xs 
is one or other of b fpecified ys and the negative form would be as 
in no one of a fpecified xs is any one of fpecified ys if propofi 
tions be ftated in this way the conditions of inference are as follows 
let the effehive number of a propofition be the number of mentioned 
cafes ofthfubjesi if it be an affirmative propofition or of the middle 
term if it be a negative propofition thus in each one of xs is 
one or other of ys is a propofition the effelive number of which 
is always but no one of xs is any one of ys is a propo 
fition the effeuve number of which is or according as x or y 
is the middle term of the fyuogifm in which it is to be ufed then 
two propofitions each of two terms and having one term in common 
admit an inference when i they are not both negative the 
fum of the eflfeduve numbers of the two premifes is greater than the 
whole number of exifling cafes of the middle term and the excefs of 
that fum above the number of cafes of the middle term is the number 
of the cafes in the affirmative premifs which are the fubjedb of inference 
thus if there be ys and we can fay that each of xs is one or 
other of ys and that no one of zs is any one of ys — the 
effeduve numbers are and and exceeding by 
there are xs of which we may affirm that no one of them is any 
one of zs mentioned 

 the following brief fummary will enable the reader to obferve the 
complete deduuon of all the ariftotelian forms and the various modes 
of inference from fpecific particulars of which a fhort account has 
already been given 

 let a be the whole number of xs and the number fpecified in 
the premifs let c be the whole number of zs and w the number 
fpecified in the premifs let b be the whole number of ys and u and 
v the numbers fpecified in the premifes of x and z let xy„ denote 
that each of xs is affirmed to be one out of ys and x y that 
each of t xs is denied to be any one out of u ys let x„„ fignify m 



 appendix 

xs taken out of a larger fpecified number n and fo on then the five 
poffible fyllogifms on the condition that no contraries are to enter either 
premiies or conclufion are as follows —

 the condition of inference exprefles itfelf in the x of the con 
clufion m muft neither be o nor negative the firft cafe gives no 
ariftotelian fyllogifm the middle term never entering univerfally of 
neceffity into any of its forms under any degree of fpecification which 
the ufual modes of fpeaking allow the other cafes divide the old fyl 
logifms among themfelves in the following manner they are written o 
as to ihow that there is fometimes a little difference of amount of fpeci 
fication between the refults of different figures which changes in the 
reduction from one figure to another the rpman numerals mark the

appendix 
on fome forms of inference differing from thofe of the arijlotelians 

i think it defirable to ftate all i know of any attempt to deal with 
the forms pf inference otherwife than in the ariftotelian method 
since the time of wallis three well known mathematicians have written 
on the fubjedl euler lambert and gergonne there may have been 
others but i have not met with them 

eulers lettres a une princefle dauemagne fur quelques fujets de 
phyfiqueet de philofophie vols vo peterfburg accord 
ing to fufs contain the repreientation of the fyllogifm hy fenjtble terms 
namely areas there was a paris edition by condorcet and lacroix 
in as is ilated by dr henry hunter who publifhed an englifh 
tranllation from it and from the original edition london vols 
vo euler makes ufe of circles to reprefent the terms in a traft 
publifhed or completed in in the library of ufefiil knowledge 
under the name of the study and difficulties of mathematics i fell 
upon this method before i knew what euler had done uiing for dif 
tindlion fquares circles and triangles as in chapter i of this work 
the author of the outlines prefently mentioned has what i con 
fider a very happy improvement on euler the propofition fome x 
is y is reprefented by the latter as the circle of x partly infide and 
partly outfide the y the author of the outlines puts a broken 
fegment of the circle of x infide the circle of y leaving it unfettled 
whether the refl of the circle is united to the broken piece or tranf 
ferred elfewhere 

but euler had been preceded in the publication of this idea by lam 
bert in his neues organon c leipzig vols vo in 
this work the terms are reprefented by lines and identical extents by 
parts of the lines vertically under one another as in page the 
whole notion is reprefented by continuous line the part left indefinite 
in particular propofitions by dotted line some of the contranominal 
forms are more diflindly mentioned than is ufual but there is no intro 
dudlion that i can find of any form of inference which is not ariflote 
lian 

 i fhould fay that euler does not ufe the numerical but the magnitu iinal notion 
fee page of this work 



 appendix 

in the feventh volume of the annales de mathematiques nifmes 
 and to there is a paper by the editor m gcrgonne 
entitled ejfai de dialesique rationelle i did not fee this paper nor 
lamberts work until after my memoir in the tranfations of the 
cambridge society had been publifhed the fecond would have given 
me no hint the firft might have done fo there is the idea and fbme 
formal ufe of a complex propofition but the divilion is erroneous 
the fubidentical identical and fuperidentical forms are there thefe 
are not eafily miiled the others which gergonne ufes are the complete 
exclufion the contrary or fub contrary of my fyftem which disjundlively 
are only the conmion univerfal negative and partial inclufion zoitb par 
tial exclufion the complex particular or fupercontrary of mine the 
ufe of contraries is expreflly forbidden the old codverfion by contra 
pofition formally declared falfe and the particular propofition aflerted 
to be incapable of being made univerfal but m gergonnes complex 
propofitions fuch as they are are ufed in a manner refembling that in 
chapter v of this work though requiring a feparate tdtonnement for 
many things the analogues of which appear as connefted refults of my 
fyftem accordingly i am bound to attribute to m gergonne the firft 
publication of the idea of tf complex fyllogifm and of the comparifon of 
the fimple one with it but numerical ftatement is not hinted at 

sir william hamiltons fyftem dates as to its publication in ledhires 
from as far as has yet appeared what i have to fay of it will 
be found in another appendix 

in there was publifhed anonymoufly outline of the laws of 
thought london and oxford pickering and graham osavo in twos 
fmall the author is the rev wm thomfon tutor of queens 
college oxford it is a very acute work and learned the fyftem of 
propofitions is extendedby the introdulion of both the common quanti 
fications of the predicate into the affirmatives only which introduces the 
propofitions u and y as the author calls them or all xs are all ys 
and some xs are all ys 

the memoir in the cambridge tranfalions in which i gave the firft 
account of what has fince grown into chapters iv v viii and x of 
this work is deferibed as to date in the preceding appendix with re 
ference to the fubjeft of chapter v i may note the following defers 
of that memoir i that only one arrangement of x and z as pre 
mifes being taken only half the fyftem is given and many correlative 
arrangements are not obtained fee page that owing to my 
not feeing diftinftly that each univerfal propofition has two weakened 
forms the fyllogifms ajai and eeii are confidered as a clafs apart 
 that much of the power of forming eafy rules is not gained by the 
order of reference being made xy zy xz inftead of xy yz xz 
the former appears at firft the more natural order and is certainly 

• i am told that feme works on logic ufed in the irifli colleges formally announce 
that the truth of the ordinary laws of fyllogifm depends upon the qclufion of contra 
ries but i have not met with any of them 



appendix 

more eaiily defcribed namely to refer each of the concluding terms to 
the middle term with which both are compared i obferve iince 
that m gergonne adopts this laft order of reference but the other is 
by an inmienfe deal more convenient in its refults as i think i have 
fhown 

with refpeft to the numerical quantification what i did in the me 
moir and addition is given in full in the preceding appendix sir 
william hamilton who diftinduy renounces all claim to the arithme 
tically articulate fyftem and doubts whether it afford any bafis for a 
logical developement ftates that he had formerly obtained the ultia 
total quantification page and thrown it away as a cumbrous and 
ufelefs fubtlety without publiihing it as i underftand in any way to 
his reply he appends a note which i think it defirable to republifh at 
length as a document in the hiftory of this fpeculation and that i may 
make that hiftory complete ii p 

 i have avoided in the previous letter and poftfcript all details in 
 regard to the third fcheme of quantification p becaufe that fcheme 
 except in fo far as it is confounded with the fecond has no bearing in 
the controverfy and i admit that whatever mr de morgan has 

 therein accomplifhed he has accomplifhed independently of me fur 
 ther i fhall not deny him any claim of priority to whatever he may 

 have ftated in our correfpondence in reference to this third fcheme 

 finally i fhall acknowledge for i think it not improbable that his 
 fyllogiim p fuggefled a reconfideration on my fickbed of a cer 
 tain former fpeculation in regard to the ultratotal quantification of the 

 middle term in both premifes together — a fpeculation determined by 
 the vacillation of the logicians touching the predefignations morey mofly 

 c but which i had laid afide as a ufelefs and cumbrous fubtlety 

 ariftotle followed by the logicians did not introduce into his doc 
 trine of fyllogifm any quantification between the abfolutely univerfal 

 and the merely particular predefignations for valid reafons — ° such 

 quantifications were of no value or application in the one whole the 

 univerfal potential logical or as i would amplify it in the two cor 
 relative and counter wholes the logical — and the formal adlual 
 metaphyfical with which logic is converfant for all that is out of 
 clafljfication all that has no reference to genus and fpecies is out of 
 logic indeed out of philofophy for philofophy tends always to the 

 univerfal and iieceftary thus the higheft canons of dedu£live reafon 
 ing the disia de omni et de nulloy were founded on and for the 

 procedure from the univerfal whole to the fubjeft parts whilft con 
 verfely the principle of indulive reafoning was eflablifhed on and for 

 the real or prefumed colleftion of all the fubjeft parts as conftituting 
 the univerfal whole — ° the integrate or mathematical whole on 
 the contrary whether continuous or difcrete the philofophers con 
 temned for whilft as ariftotle obferves in mathematics genus and 

 fpecies are of no account it is almoft exclufively in the mathemati 

 cal whole that quantities are compared together through a middle 

 term in neither premife equal to the whole but this reafoning in

 appendix 

which the middle term is never univerfal and the concludon always 
particular is — as vague partial and contingent— of little or no value 
in philofophy it was accordingly ignored in logic and the prede 
fignations more moj c as i have faid referred to univerfal or 
as was moft common to particular or to neither quantity this 
difcrepancy among logicians long ago attraded my attention and i 
faw at once that the poffibility of inference confidered abfolutely 
depended exclufively on the quantifications of the middle term in both 
premifes being together more than its poffible totality — its diftribution 
in any one at the fame time i was impreffed — i with the almoft 
utter inutility of fuch reafbning in a philofophical relation and ® 
alarmed with the load of valid moods which its recognition in logic 
would introduce the mere quantification of the predicate under the 
two pure quantities of definite and indefinite and the two qualities of 
affirmative and negative gives abftrally in each figure thirty fix 
valid moods which if my prefent calculation be correal would be 
multiplied by the introdulion of the two hybrid or ambiguous quan 
tifications of a majority and a half to the fearful amount oi four hun 
dred and eighty valid moods for each figure though not at the 
time fully aware of the flrength of thefe objelions they however 
prevented me from breaking down the old limitation but as my fu 
preme canon of syllogifm proceeds on the mere formal poffibility of 
reafoning it of courfe comprehends all the legitimate forms of quanti 
fication it is — what worft relation of fubjesl and predicate fubfifts 
between either of two terms and a common third term with which one 
at leafty is pofitively related s — that relation fubfifts between the two 
terms themelves in other words — in as far as two notions both 
agree or one agreeing the other dif agrees with a common third notion 
— info far thofe notions agree or dif agree with each other this canon 
applies and proximately to all categorical fyllogifms — in extenfion 
and comprehenfion — affirmative and negative — and of any figure it 
determines all the varieties of fuch fyllogifms is developed into all 
their general and fuperfedes all their fpecial laws in fhort without 
violating this canon no categorical reafoning can formally be wrong 
now this canon fuppofes that the two extremes are compared together 
through the fame common middle and this cannot but be if the 
middle whether fubjeft or predicate in both its quantifications to 
gether exceed its totality though not taken in that totality in either 
premife 

 but as i have flated i was moved to the reconfideration of this 
whole matter and it may have been mr de morgans fyllogifm in 
our correfpondence p which gave the fuggeflion the refult 
was the opinion that thefe two quantifications fhould be taken into 
account by logic as authentic forms but then relegated as of little 
ufe in praftice and cumbering the fcience with a fuperfluous mafs of 
moods as to mr de morgans flatement in our correfpondence p 
 of the principle on which by his later fyftem fuch fyllogifms 
proceed this to ufe his own expreffion i did not comprehend at

let the effebive number of cafes in a propofition be the number which it makes ef 
fedlive in inference then the effeve number in a pofitive propofition is the num 
ber of cafes of the yv 

the effeve number in a negative propofidon is the number of cafes of the mddle 
term 

and the criterion of inference being pofiible is that the fum of the effeve num 
bers of the two premifes not both negative is greater than the vbole number of cafes 
of the middle term

 by the logician as affording valid inference but which without fcien

 definite whole ultratotal it is enough for a

 before concluding i ought to apologife in the circumflances for 

 the details that have infenfibly lengthened out of a part of my doc 

 trine which i have found to a certain extent coincident with what 

 appears in your paper i was anxious however that you and others 

 fhould have no grounds for furmifing that i borrowed any thing from 
my predeceffors without due acknowledgment — on fecond thoughts 

 however i deem it more proper to make this communication through 

 a third party 

the difcufljon between sir william hamilton and myfelf called a 
very able third party into the field who addrefled the following letter 
to the editor of the atbenaum in which journal it was publiftied june 

i 

 sir — as two great logical innovations — the one due to sir william 

 hamilton the other due to mr de morgan — ufed in conjunftion have 

 led me to the iimpleft and moft general formulae of fyllogifm that ever 

 have been given formulae which corredl a ferious miftake into which 

 both sir william hamilton and mr de morgan have fellen i think 

 it will gratify thofe interefted in logical fcience if yoii would give them 

 publicity through your columns 

 r c are any numbers when placed before a term as 

 nxsy marks the total number of the clafs x placed before a pro 
 pofition it marks the number of things of which we mean to ipeak 

 thus n of nxs are of means that a number of things are 

 alleged to have both the charafteriftics x and y and are to the whole 

 clafs of xs n to ni and to the whole clafs of jj as to r • fimi 

 larly with the negative propofition of rxs are not of 

 things being here faid to have the charafteriftic x and to want the 

 charafteriftic y it is clear from the nature of a propofition that in 
 affirmatives n can never be greater than the leaft extenfive of the 

 terms and in negatives never greater than the number of the clafs 
 whofe charadleriftic it is faid to have but within thefe limits the pro 



 appendix 

 portion to r may be wholly undetermined we then mark it with 

 the word fome — we call this with sir william hamilton indefinite 

 quantity it may be perfeuy determined as of equality when we mark 

 it with a ezery or following mr de morgan any other arithmcti 
 cal proportion — as a half sir william hamilton has erred in calling 
 a half femidefinite it is thoroughly definite all this we call defi 
 nite quantity lallly the indefinitude may be reduced within limits 

 — indefinitodefinite as mofi c 

 the firft formula contains all fyllogifms with an affirmative conclu 

 fion without any exception 

 i of nxs are o£nys 

 ofnzs are o£ nys 
„i„iy — „in ofnxs are of nzs 

 as sir william hamiltons principle takes away all diftinftion of 

 fubjeft and predicate in affirmative propofitions it will be feen that by 

 varying the proportions of the fy mbols c every poffible affirma 

 tive logical inference in whatever mood or figure emerges 

 the fyllogifms with negative queftions or conclufions arc not fo 
iimple they fall into two divifions according as in the negative 
 premifs the things fpoken of have the charafteriftic of the extreme or 
of the middle and from each of thefe two conclufions not one are 
 drawn according as the things to be fpoken of in the conclufion have 

 the charafteriflic of the extreme in the affirmative premifs or of that 

 in the negative premifs 

 ii n of n xs are of nys 

 n of rtzs are not of nys concludes 
 doubly i® — n of nxs are not of nzs 
 n — of ftzs are not of nxs 

 it is to this formula i referred as correcting a ferious error into which 

 sir william hamilton and mr de morgan have fallen — of holding as 
 a general principle of all inference that the two quantifications of the 

 middle term fhould exceed it as a whole for this fyllogifm proceeds 

 wholly irrefpelive of the total quantity of the middle which is excluded 

 from our fymbolic conclufion 

 iii of tixs are of i™ys 

n of rys are not of if zs concludes alfo 
 doubly v jt •n — rf of n°xs are not of tfzs 

 r r — ™ — of ffzs are not of ffxs 

 such are the three fymbolical formulae of every poffible logical infe 

 rence i have the demonftrations that thefe are in all thir extent valid 

 and are the only poffible forms but it is fufficient to give here the re 

 fults 

 it will furprife no one who confiders that the negative propofition is 
 not converted in the fame fenfe as the affirmative that the negative 
 fyllogiftic formulae are not reducible to one for the rule of negative 



• 



appendix 

 converlion changes the things fpoken of and is as follows n of jxs 
 are not of nys converts n — of nys are not of nxs the 
 confequence of a forn univerfally true nn oinys are not ofnxs 

 as to the two conclufions they are but the converfe of each other 

 it will not be difficult to interpret thefe by n zi as every or n 

 tf indefinite zzfome c the ufual ariftotelic forms will be fcen to 

 be derived from them thus the mood cefare and the correfponding 
 indireft mood or if you will the mood of the fourth figure call it at 

 another time celantes or cadere at will but let it be celantes for the 
 nonce come forth from the third formula 

 n gives no yls z n irf indefinite 
 n zz every z is y r™ indefinite 

 hence in cefare no ir is from our firft 

 and in celantes no is f from our fecond conclufion and fo of all 

 the others 

 i owe it to sir william hamilton and mr de morgan to fay that 

 without their improvements i could not have advanced one ftep mr de 

 morgan has even attempted a like reduftion to general formulae and has 

 failed chiefly through a mifappreheniion of sir william hamiltons prin 

 ciple of quantified predicate he has introduced a fuperfluous quantity 

 — one logically ufelefs or worfe than ufelefs as the refult has fhown 

 this confufion explains his errors had it not been for this circum 
 fiance i fhould not have had the honour of prefenting thefe formulae 

 to logicians 

 permit me to add what i think alfo of fome value i am not of thofe 
 who think with sir william hamilton that the fyllogifm always pro 
 ceeds in the two counter wholes of intenfion and extenfion — that it 
 muft always be an involution or fevolution in refpeft of claffification 

 this is no doubt true in the moft important reafonings of fcience but 

 it is not fcientifically accurate to aflert this univerfally 

 quality which is the comprehenfive element is of three kinds — not 

 two as heretofore affirmed for fince kant the divifion of affirmatives 
 into analytic and fynthetic or as sir william hamilton wiihes expli 

 cative and ampliative has been eftablifhed james bernouilli has puz 
 zled himfelf to reduce thefe two to the fame form but without fuccefs 
 for that contains an immediate relation of part to whole and only a re 

 mote one of part to part while this contains an immediate relation of 

 part to part and remote of part to whole thefe as diftinft kinds of 

 quality are erroneoufly elided in language as the words ampliative 

 and reftriitive are generally oppofed in logic perhaps we might replace 
 the old divifion of propofitions according to quality into affirmative and 

 negative — by one into explicative ampliative and reftrislive 

where then both premifes are ampliative the fyllogifm proceeds 

 purely by force of extenfion there is neither involution nor evolution 

 — neither induction nor dedulion — but a paflage or tranfition from one 

 mark to another or from clafs to clafs of this kind are all angular 
or as ramus calls them proper fyllogifms let us call this new 



 appendix 

 clafs of fyllogifms tradulive to contrail it with the indulivc and de 

 duftive 

 the ufe of thefe in philofophy as independent modes of inference will 

 eafily appear when we colleft the fcattered fragments of our know 
 ledge into unity of fcience we ufe indusiion and indusiive fyllogifm 

 when we apply the principles of fcience to fpecial events of things we 

 ufe deduct on and deductive fyllogifm s but when abandoning one fcheme 
 of claffification we transfer our knowledge diresily to another we ufe 
 tradubion and traduilive fyllogifm thus in political fcience what 
 has been predicated by hiftorians of men claffed geographically is tranf 

 ferred to men claffed according to conflitutions of government by tra 

 duftion this lail efcapes sir william hamiltons rule and never 

 concludes through a comprehenfive containing and contained 

 i fhall not add at prefent any attempt to prove a priori the exclufive 

 validity of fyllogiflic inference 

 i admit that i ought not without good ground to diffent from a ma 

 tured opinion of sir william hamilton in any part of philofophy ftill 

 more in logic but i obey the force of demonftration — and as ludo 
 vicus vives faid in refpeft to ariflotle verecundi dijjentio

my reply to this confifled in forwarding on the fame th of june 
to the editor of the athenaum a fummary of the refults of chapter vii f 
then written this fummary appeared on the th i do not infert it 
becaufe the chapter in queflion is a better anfwer and though the pub 
lication faved my rights the republication is unneceftary mr brouns 
three forms are the firft without the contranominal the ninth and the 
eleventh of page mr broun was wrong in deducing from the 
two latter forms that the principle of the middle term was erroneous 
for in thefe very forms the two quantifications exceed the whole being 
the whole in premife one plus fome in the other as to the fiiper 
fluous quantity it only becomes fuperfluous when fuch quantifications 
are introduced as diflinguifh fpurious from admiffible propofitions fee 
pages in which it is fhown that the forms are correft 

nothing but clofe comparifon and that after pralice would deteft 
the accordance of the two fymbolic modes of expreifion in pages 
and i am not therefore furprifed that mr broun fhould having 
obtained cafes of that in page pronounce that in page erro 
neous 

in the anfwer which i made i promifed to ftate diilinuy how much 
of the chapter was written before mr brouns letter appeared this 
i now do with the exception of pages the matter of which 
is moflly from my cambridge memoir the whole of it was then written 
excepting fuch verbal alterations and occafional introdulion of fentences 
as take place at the prefs or at the lafl reading of the manufcript i had 



appendix 

thoyght that there would be no neceffity to introduce thofe pages ex 
cept flightly and in anfwer to certain obje£lions which teemed likely to 
occur the examination which the aflertion that they are erroneous 
made me give my previous forms pointed out the defirablenefs of intro 
ducing them as they now ftand 

september i had finifhed the preceding appendix when i 
became aware of the exiftence of the commentationes philofophicae 
seledliores of godfrey ploucquet of tubingen utrecht quarto 
the laft title p is de arte charafteriftica subjicitur methodus 
calculandi in logicis ab auftore inventa i js i find by a catalogue 
that this methodus calculandi had been previoufly publiihed in at 
tubingen at the end of a work entitled principia de subftantiis et 
phaenomenis alfo that the methodus demonftrandi direfte omnes 
fyllogifmorum fpecies of the fame author which is probably the thing 
i am going to defcribe was publifhed at tubingen in from the 
title of a work which i am informed exifts namely sammlung der 
schriften welche von logifchen calcul des prof ploucquet betrefien 
tubingen one would fuppofe that this fyftem had obtained great 
local currency i give a fhort account of it premifing that ploucquet 
appears to have been a well informed mathematician much given to 
pure fpeculation on mental fubjefts 

the calculus a term which ploucquet ufes in as wide a fenfe as i do 
when i call the contents of chapter v a part of the calculus of infe 
rence confifts in the invention of a iimple notation and the mechanical 
fubftitution in one premife of an identical equivalent to the middle term 
therein contained taken from the other premife this laft being one in 
which the middle term is univerfal there is neither ufe of contraries 
nor numerical definition but there is every variety of quantity of the 
predicate which can be produced by fimple converfion of the ordinary 
forms a term ufed univerfally is denoted by the capital letter par 
ticularly by the fmall letter affirmation by juxtapofition negation by 
interpofing thus xy is xy xy is x y xy is xy xy is 
x y the following is a complete fpecimen 

sint prae pm 
miftse sm 



calculo s mp quoddam s non eft p 

omnis ducatus eft aureus 
qusedam moneta non eft aurea 

m a 
calc m ad feu m d qusedam moneta non eft ducatus 

as ploucquet feems to think that this aftual application of the calculus 
to concrete inftances by aid of their initial letters is a material part of 

 the jecond edition of mr blakeys eflay on logic recently publiihed contains 
a catalogue of upwards of a thoufand works on logic briefly titled 



 appendix 

his fyftem i have inferted the cafe entire the rationale of the fyftem 
confifts in that fubftitution of identicals for each other which i under 
ftand sir william hamilton with perfedt truth to employ in every 
cafe thus we have in the above some of the ss are not any ms 
are not thofe ms which make up all the ps are not therefore any ps 
this demand for identical fubftitutes requires both kinds of quantity for 
every predicate and ploucquet ufes them accordingly as as wanted 
to eftablifh the ariftotelian fyllogifms sir w hamilton goes further 
and invents fyllogifms for all the kinds of quantity thus ploucquet 
ufes mp or fome ms are all the ps and p m or all ps are not fome 
of the ms but not mp or p m 

at the fame time with the knowledge of ploucquet i obtained that 
of the work of a follower and extender m w drobitfch author of 
 neue darftellung der logik nebft einen logifchmathematifchen 
anhange leipzig odavo as far as the fymbolic part is con 
cerned mr drobitfch begins by a convention which would reconcile 
any one to the found not merely of barbara and celarent but even of 
baroko and frejtfon he makes s and p the fubjeft and predicate of 
the conclufion and m the middle term and puts the ariftotelian vowel 
between them thus sp is sap and ps is pos hence his pre 
mifes may be map f am or mop fam and one of his fyllogifms is mep 
famfep in the algebraical part he ufes large and fmall letters for the 
univerfal and particular or for the whole and part extent of a term 
hfe alfo introduces the figns rz and to lignify identity and what i 
call fubidentity this ufe of the mathematical figns involves an ex 
tenfion which is made by all thofe who fignify the identity of x and 
y by xy the mathematician thinks of extent as quantity only 
the logician includes both quantity and pofition thus when the for 
mer fays that five feet are lefs than feven feet he means any five feet 
be they part of the feven feet or not the latter when he fays that x 
is a name of lefs extent than y means not only that the former can be 
contained in the latter but that it is to make negative propofitions 
mr drobitfch takes a limited univerfe call it u as i have done an 
extent greater than the utmoft extent of all the names otherwife inde 
finite and here he fells into fome confufion x and y being the 
names he fays u muft be of greater extent than xy now if we had 
xy u need only be of greater extent than y if from the genus y 
be taken all the fpecies x the remainder is denoted by y — x ac 
cordingly the contrary of x is u — x 

mr drobitfch then lays down eight forms of predication of which 
however he only ufes the ordinary ones and i cannot find out that 
the limited univerfe or the contrary has any ufe except to fiirnifh means 
of notation the eight forms are — firft xy or my xy fecondly 
xy or xyyx thirdly xy or xy fourthly uy or 
yx fifthly xju — y which tells us that x is all contained in 
what is left of the univerfe after y is removed or is xy fiixthly 
xz z ju — y a very roundabout way of faying that x vifubcori 
trary of y or xyxy feventhly xu — y or xy eighthly 



appendix 

xx — y which tells us that y is a fubidentical of x or yxxy 

this is in faft a mixture of two fyftcms both in principle and nota 
tion the forms are a a and o e i d d and d and 
ci alfo c is virtually given but e i c do not appear the 
ordinary rules under which the mathematicians ufe and j remain 
true in this logical ufe of them and thus there is an elegant mode or 
exhibiting the inference in fyllogifms for inftance in cameftres we 
have pzzm s u— m ju— m u— p or s u— p 

it would have been more confiftent to have made n j and in 
troducing this laft ferve all purpofes but it has happened very often 
that a fyftem of notation already exhibited has been extended by a better 
one and mended only inftead of being reconftrudled ploucquet had 
ufed the large and fnlill letters and for denial the latter fymbol a 
ftrange one if mathematical analogy were intended mr drobitfch 
has ingenioufly contrived that fhould reprefent denial and has been 
led to what might have ufefully amended all he had to begin with tak 
ing little x to reprefent a part of the extent of x c and u for the ex 
tent of the univerfe the following notation might have been adopted 

firft when j and both include their limit we fhould have 



a xyoryx 

 xu— yoru— yx 

e xu— yoru— yx 

ii xjy or yx 



a yx or xy 
o yu— xoru— xy 
e xu— y or u— yx 
i is inexpreffible 



to exprefs i we muft invent a fymbol for a part of u — x 
next when and do not include their limits we have 



d x y or y x 
d xy or yx 
d xyorylx 



c xu— yoru— yx 
c xu— y or u— yzix 
c xu— y or u— yx 

p is inexpreffible 



i am inclined to think that the reprefentation of quantity and location 
both under one fymbol is objeftionable if that fymbol be one already 
appropriated in mathematics to quantity only i would on no account 
accuftom myfelf to read a b as a is lefs than becaufe a part of b 
mr drobitfch is much more complete than his predeceitors in his enu 
meration of the various kinds of forites 

osfober while this fheet was paffing through the prefs 
i became acquainted with a fyllabus of logic in which the views of 
kant are generally adopted and the laws of fyllogifm fymbolically ex 
prefled by thomas solly efq cambridge vo the 
fymbolical expreffion here given is of a peculiar character the algebraic 
ligns are adopted in a fenfe which preferves the rules of fign while the 
fymbols reprefent the terms of the fyllogifm or elfe the notions of par 
ticular and univerfal thus if ftand for particular u for univerfal 
and m for one of the terms of a fyllogifm mzzu or m—uzio implies 



 appendix 

that ot is a univerfal term and r —— o implies the alternative 
that either m is univerfal or is particular by means of fuch alter 
native relations the conditions of validity of the various figures are 
expreifed mr solly contends for fix forms in each figure by intro 
ducing all forms which have weakened conclufions and proves a priori 
from his equations that fix and no more are pofiible in each figure if 
i had admitted weakened forms there would have been fixteen more 
fyllogifms which might be deduced either from the eight univerfals or 
from the fixteen particulars
