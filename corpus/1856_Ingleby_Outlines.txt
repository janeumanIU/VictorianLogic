pkeface 

the following pages are designed to form the 
basis of classinstruction in the science of theo 
retical logic as many modem works of this kind 
are in circulation a few words may be expected in 
explanation of the motives whichhave induced me to 
give this treatise to the public the discoveries of 
sir william hamilton upon which these outlines 
are mainly founded do not date further back than 
 in which year they were first promulgated of 
the treatises which have been published since that 
date two only profess to embody those discoveries 
and those two are not fitted to form the textbook 
of a lectureroom all other treatises are deficient 
in several of the staple subjects of the science and 
the majority intrench upon the domains of lan 
guage rhetoric and philosophy a good text 
book is therefore a desideratum accordingly 
when i commenced my lectures at the institute i 
was thrown entirely on my own resources for the 
exposition of several important branches of the 
science and it was not long before a request was 
preferred to me by several of my claas to print for 



vi preface 

their benefit certain of the notes with which i had 
famished them and which consumed much time 
in dictation 

the peculiar characteristics of the following 
treatise are the doctrine of extension and inten 
sion the quantification of the predicate the 
solution of opposed propositions the reduction 
of the thirtysix moods in each figure to nine es 
sential moods the evolution of all additional 
moods caused by the introduction of the sign of 
partial quantity on the one hand and by the ultra 
total quantification of the middle term on the 
other and the doctrine of induction the 
treatise is likewise characterised by the exclusion 
therefirom of the doctrine of modals and of enthy 
memes and sorites 

in the treatment of syllogisms i have employed 
no scheme of pictorial notation for the simple rea 
son that i am thoroughly convinced of the general 
uselessness of any such and therefore strongly de 
precate its use i am acquainted with the schemes 
of euler ploucquet lambert hamilton and 
boole of which i take lamberts to be the best 
but i am far firom thinking it desirable to trouble 
the student with it 

li the course of the following pages i have not 
scrupled to avail myself of the demonstrations of 



preface vii 

others and where i have found such expressed 
with a truth clearness and precision which i 
should despair of approaching i have transplanted 
into my own work as much as i found necessary 
in all cases except in the statement of the canons 
of syllogisms which are taken from sir william 
hamiltons disquisitions acknowledging the obli 
gation by annexing the name of the author but 
inasmuch as in all such cases i have not unfre 
quently amended the grammatical construction i 
have been unable to indicate the extracts by the 
usual addition of 

i have already stated the immediate design of 
my work independently of that i have sufficient 
fidth in my own labours to entertain the hope that 
they may not be without influence upon logic as a 
branch of liberal education in the universities 
this hope will be fully realised as far as cam 
bridge is concerned if i am in the most indirect 
manner instrumental in giving logic a place in 
the curriculum of her studies and thus removing 
from her a stigma as disgracefril as it is peculiar 

my claims to originality are small they are 
confined to the treatment of logical opposition and 
the principle of the congruity of syllogisms in 
stating the thirtysix moods of the syllogism i 
have not borrowed from any other writer but have 



draim them up from my own investigation how 
ever i believe they will be found to agree with 
those of sir william hamilton

introduction 



of the definition and sphere of 
theoretical logic 

theoretical logic is the science of the 
laws of thought 

thought is conversant with conception 
 judgment reasoning science 

the mind in performing the act of conception 
forms a concept of every object of thought 

conception is the process the concept is the 
product 

a concept is the cognition or idea of the gene 
ral attribute or attributes in which a plurality of 
objects coincide hamilton 

this process of conception obviously involves 
the perception of a number of objects their com 
parison the recognition of their points of similarity 
and their subjective union by this common attri 
bute baynes 

accordingly a concept may either refer to an 
individual or to a species that is a class compre 
hending several individuals or to a genus that is 
i l 



 introduction 

a class comprehending several species or to higher 
clasps 

judgment is the action of referring one concept 
to another the result of such action put into 
words is a sentence expressing the relation between 
two concepts the concepts in such a sentence 
are called the terms and the sentence itself is 
called the proposition 

a proposition is an expression thaf two notions 
or concepts can or cannot be reconciled thomson 

keasoning is concerned with the relation that 
subsists between two propositions the two being 
compared the result is the generation of a third 
proposition 

in certain cases which will be explained in 
the right place an inference expressed in words 
is called a simple illation in other cases a syl 
logism 

a system of such illations and syllogisms con 
catenated according to the laws of logical progres 
sion is called an organon 

an organon may be either for the discovery of 
truth or for imparting it to others 

what logic is not 

logic is not concerned with the philosophy of 
language or in any way with the means of ex 
pressing what is thought 

language expresses all that is thought logic 
is the instrument of which language is the material 
and philosophy the result as the prerequisite of 
philosophy is logic so the prerequisite of logic is 



introduction 

language logic abhors an ellipsis when an el 
lipsis is presented to logic logic demands whether 
the ellipsis is an ellipsis of thought or of language 
merely whether there is in point of fact an un 
certainty in thought which language has faithfully 
expressed or whether the thoijght is simple sure 
clear and language has introduced the ellipsis as 
an idiom merely if the thought is uncertain 
logic applies itself to deal with the ellipsis which 
is the faithful exponent of that thought but it 
may oblige language to eliminate the ellipsis for 
the sake of clearness and precision if however 
the ellipsis is one of language merely the thought 
being explicit logic will not deal with the ellipsis 
at all but will demand as the prerequisite of its 
action that the ellipsis should be eliminated and 
the implicit thought should be rendered explicit in 
language in all cases logic deals with what is 
thought and with that only 

logic does not concern itself with any existing 
real objects nor with the content or matter con 
tained in any term or proposition 

as language deals with the representation of 
thoughts with a view to the communication of 
them fixm one thinker to another philosophy re 
gards only the matter the content of those thoughts 
and the evolution of practical truth now logic 
being the instrument that enables philosophy to 
deal with language it is an intrusion for logic to 
pretend to deal with the matter or content of 
thoughts philosophy requires logic to fiimish the 

— 



 introduction 

formal organon for the inyestigation of practical 
truth i e the determination of facts in all cases 
then logic deals with the form of what is thought 
with concepts and their relation in judgment and 
inference 

a term may refer to an aaually existing 
thing or to a class under which seyeral objects are 
subsumed 

but logic has nothing to do with the concrete 
object that is the object considered in itself but 
solely with the concept of which the term is the 
sign 

so also a proposition may be true or false or 
it may express a contingent truth or an apodictic 
truth an universal and necessary truth 

but logic has nothing to do with these things 
it is concerned only with the form of the pro 
position 

 accordingly the only fallacies of reasoning that 
logic can take cognizance of are departures from 
the formal laws of the syllogism all other fallacies 
bjplong to physics or to metaphysics 

so also logic has nothing to do with the ad 
visability of suppressing a premiss or otherwise 
accommodating an argument to the habits of 
thought of men in general such matters belong 
exclusively to rhetoric 

from the above remarks it is plain that neither 
the doctrine of modals nor any exposition of 
enthymemes or sorites ought to find place in a 
treatise on logic

of terms 



had man no power of classifying in intellect 
the confiised multitude of objects presented to the 
senses he must remain for ever destitute of any 
thing worthy of the name of knowledge with no 
clear recognition even of the individual since 
comparison and discrimination would be impossi 
ble he must for ever abide amidst the obscurity 
and vagueness in which knowledge commences — 
helpless amidst a multiplicity of objects which 
he could not comprehend — bewildered by a con 
fusion which there would be no possibility of re 
calling to order the earliest effort of the mind is 
accordingly directed to extricate itself from this 
confasion and this determines the exercise of the 
comparative faculty and the formation of concepts 
batnes 

amidst the multitude of confiised objects pre 
sented to the mind in perception apprehension 



 op terms 

some are found to affect us similarly in certain 
respects these objects the mind considers by 
comparison it recognises their resembling qualities 
by attention these qualities are exclusively con 
sidered since the concentration of the mind on 
them involves of necessity its abstraction from those 
in which they are severally dissimilar since the 
resembling attributes which these various objects 
possess in common cannot when separately con 
sidered be discriminated the objects themselves 
are in this restricted point of view necessarily con 
sidered as one in other words the understanding 
grasps into unity a multitude of objects severally 
distinct by a common feature of identity on this 
unity thus formed it sets the seal of a name that 
it may be enabled ever afterwards at once to discri 
minate the various objects of its knowledge and 
commodiously to refer each to its own class and 
thus be saved the endless labour of enumerating 
all the particulars by which objects are individu 
ally discriminated a notion is thus a purely 
ideal or subjective whole which the mind from the 
limitation of its power is necessitated to form in 
order to classify in thought and discriminate in 
language the various objects of its knowledge 
batnes 

this being the case it is obvious that a concept 
can afford only a partial knowledge and has only 
a relative existence it can only afford a partial 
knowledge since it embraces some only of the 



of terms 

manj marks by which an object is known it has 
only a relative existence since this knotiedge is 
not given absolutely but only in connection with 
some one of the objects to which the concept is 
related for a notion though potentially appli 
cable to all the objects which it contains can only 
be truly known on occasion of its being actually 
applied to some one of these objects this is at 
once the test and the evidence of its relative cha 
racter and this being its character it is obviously 
altogether dependent on the objects from which it 
is formed a concept has thus in its totality 
a purely subjective existence destitute of any ob 
jective reality being what it is namely an ideal 
whole subsisting only by relation to the objects 
whose resembling parts it embraces it is obvious 
that as it has no independent existence it can 
convey to us no independent knowledge and that 
if we destroy the objects we destroy the resem 
bling attributes in each and destroying the resem 
bling parts we annihilate the whole which they 
together constituted namely j the concept as 
however a concept has only a subjective being 
existence and knowledge are here identity if 
no qualities be discriminated in objects as similar 
we have no knowledge of a concept that is no 
concept exists if we cannot assign an object to 
any class that is cannot say that it does or does 
not belong to any concept we do not imderstand 
or comprehend it we think an object that is 



g of tebms 

recognise it to he what it is only as we think it 
under ime concept 

concepts being thus formed the great prerequi 
site of logic is that they shall be expressed in 
language in every part of logic grammar is 
called upon to express everything that is con 
tained in thought whether impliedly or not the 
triumph of language is the expression of a perfect 
analysis of thought concepts considered through 
the medium of a name are called terms let us 
suppose that the mind is taking cognisance of a 
number of objects and has discerned in each some 
common point of resemblance let us suppose that 
this point of resemblance has been considered apart 
from the object and that the concept of the com 
mon attribute has received the seal of a substan 
tive name this name henceforth stands for all 
 the objects severally and collectively from the 
analysis of which it sprung and each object will 
be referred to under that name with the prefix of 
the definite or indefinite article 

the more searching the analysis has been and 
in consequence the greater is the number of com 
mon points of resemblance comprised in the term 
the fewer number of objects in the universe will that 
term stand for and conversely the more superficial 
has been the scrutiny of the objects and the fewer 
the common features of identity the greater will 
be the number of objects that will stand under 
that term for example in reviewing the vege 



of terms 

table world a veiy superficial glance enables us to 
discern the circumstance that an immense number 
of different objects have the common attribute of 
green if however we descend to the more minute 
particulars than the colour of foliage if for in 
stance we seize upon such common points of re 
semblance as roots trunk boughs branches leayes 
and such like and bring these under a common 
term we shall find that the number of objects 
comprised in it is immeasureablj reduced consist 
ing in fact only of trees and shrubs in like man 
ner we shall find universally that the wider the 
term the greater the number of objects and the 
fewer the number of marks of identity whereas 
the narrower the term the fewer the number of 
objects and the greater the number of marks of 
identity this canon has been called by sir 
william hamilton the cardinal point of logic 

it is evident then that we may regard the 
term whether summum genus subaltern genus 
species or infima species as expressing two things 
st the mark or marks of identity in the indivi 
duals ndly the objects or object subsumed 
under the term 

for example body expresses primary qua 
lities namely geometrical solidity physical solid 
ity impenetrability autantitypy absolute in 
compressibility mobility and situation and also 
secundoprimary and secondary qualities it like 
wise stands for all our concepts of objects in seve 
ralty which possess these attributes in common

now to take the case of a single genus and 
a single species to begin with for the sake of sim 
plicity let x be a genns consisting of diyers 
species of which y is one it is evident that 
either of these may be considered the greater logi 
cal whole of the two that is we may consider the 
genus x as comprehending all the indiyidual 
objects of the species y or we may consider these 
indiyidual objects and therefore the species y as 
including all the marks of identity of the genus 
x in other words we may at pleasure treat the 
genus as comprehending the species or the species 
as including the genus in the former case we are 
said to proceed in the logical whole of comprehen 
sion or intension or depth in the latter we are 
said to proceed in the metaphysical whole of ex 
tension or breadth to explain which fully we 
must proceed to that branch of logic which treats 
of propositions 



paet ii 
of propositions 

for all purposes of logic a proposition nday 
be considered as simple and as such may be de 
fined to be the expression of our judgment that 
two notions or concepts do or do not agree 

it accordingly consists of two terms and a 
sign of relation is or are which is called the 
copula the one notion being afltaned or denied 
of the other the leading term of which the other is 
afltaned or denied is called the subject and the 
other term so affirmed or denied of the subject is 
called the predicate 

of the subject it is easy to see that if it stand 
or a class and not for an individual we may 
affirm the predicate of some indefinite part of it 
while on the other hand whether it stand for a 
class or an individual we may affirm the predicate 
of all the subject 

the subject then has always a quantity definite 
or indefinite and for all purposes of logic this 
quantity must be distinctly expressed in words 
and in such case the subject is said to be quantified 

thus when we say 

all men are mortal or 
some men are cowards 



of propositions 

the words ah and some are signs which ex 
press the quantification of the subject men 

owing to the ambiguities of language it is 
desirable to have recourse to the expedient of 
attaching the signs of quantity by means of a 
hyphen to the terms to which they belong thus 
 allmen 

in the previous chapter we have exhibited and 
explained the various relations of concepts in a 
system of classification from what has been 
there said it may be readily perceived that when 
we bring an object under a concept that is when 
we predicate of it that it belongs to such a class 
we must know that it occupies a certain place in 
that class for if we were uncertain what place 
the individual object occupied in the class or 
whether it occupied any place at all we should 
not know the class and could not therefore bring 
any object under it 

for example if i do not know whether rose 
comes under the concept flower or whether it is 
equal to some part or the whole of that concept or 
whether it is superior to it i do not know the 
class flower and cannot of course predicate 
 flower of rose in other words i cannot bring 
rose under the concept flower since i do not 
know what the concept means what it contains 
or what it does not this is clear for as we 
have already explained since a concept as a facti 
tious unity in thought a logical whole is abso 
lutely worthless and indeed not cognizable out of 



 op propositions 

relation to the individual objects the aggregate of 
whose resembling qualities it constitutes and since 
an object is truly known only as it is thought 
through or under a concept it follows that com 
prehension in such a case would be impossible 
k therefore we understand the object at all we 
must by an act of judgment fix in thought the 
sphere which it occupies under the class to which 
in predication we have assigned it in other 
words if we comprehend what we utter every 
notion holding the place of predicate in a proposi 
tion must have a detenninate quantity in thpught 
and therefore the predicate ought to be quantified 
in language baynes notwithstanding this un 
questionable conclusion the impropriety of such 
quantification has been tacitly assumed or expressly 
aflsrmed by the majority if not the whole of the 
logical writers of antiquity whose works are xtantl 
the few who have touched upon the subject seem 
for the most part to have conceived the possibility 
of its express quantification only universally as 

omnis homo est omne animal 
yet in point of fact there is nothing in logic more 
certain than the propriety of quantifying the predi 
cate for its quantification must always take place 
in judgment and logic as we have already said 
demands as its prerequisite that everything that is 
contained in thought shall be expressed in lan 
guage in affirming the predicate of a subject we 
simply express the relation of quantity in which 
a class stands to an individual or two classes to 



of propositions 

one another if this relation were indetenniriate 
that is if we were uncertain whether it was a part 
or whole or none there could be no predication 
the very fact of predication is therefore always 
evidence that the concept constituting the predi 
cate holds a relation of determinate quantity to the 
subject in other words we think only as we think 
under some determinate quantity all thought 
being nothing more nor less than a comparison of 
part and whole or let us put the argument in 
another form all predication is but the utter 
ance of thought the predicate has a determinate 
quantity in thought all predication must there 
fore have a determinate quantity baynes it is 
true that common language generally makes an 
ellipsis of the quantification of the predicate in the 
proposition but it does the like in respect of many 
other things which are unambiguous in thought 
more especially in inference and argumentation and 
yet in all such cases the postulate applies that for 
all purposes of logic everything that is contained 
however implicitly in thought shu have a deter 
minate expression in language we conclude then 
that in all propositions both the subject and the 
predicate ought to be quantified 

quantity belongs to terms not as some logi 
cians say to propositions but it is by an act of 
judgment that the quantity of any term is deter 
mined in respect of any other term the prin 
cipal signs of the quantity of a term are air 
and some when the proposition is negative 
il 



 of propositions 

that is contradictorily denies a predicate of a 
subject the english language necessitates the 
adoption of the sign any or no aflsrma 
tion being as we have said indicated by the copula 
s or are negation is indicated by is not 
or are not or no — is that attribute of a 
proposition which consists in its being an affirma 
tion or negation is called its quality hence 
while we speak of the quntity of the terms we 
say the quality of the proposition which expresses 
the relation between those terms 

the following table will shew the different 
species in the several genera quantity and quality 

universal • j 
particular j of a term 
individual i j 
faflsrmative 



c 



quality i negative j i of a proposition 
infinite 

it will be observed that in each of these genera 
a third species appears this is but the form of 
the coexistence of the other two thus the indi 
vidual is in respect of its species a particular but 
it constitutes in itself a universal again a pro 
position in denying an indefinitely quantified pre 
dicate of a subject affirms thereof a predicate of 
indefinite quantity thus if i say the soul is 
not mortal i posit the soul in the complement of 
 immortal that is i affirm that the soul is 
some immortal and this is called an infinite 



op propositions 

judgment because the remainder of the logical 
universe immortals is unlimited save hj the 
abstraction of all mortals and therefore is for all 
logical purposes considered as infinite however 
the indimdtuzl quantity of a term and the infinite 
quality of a proposition belong rather to the matter 
or content of such term and proposition respect 
ively and as such are not subjects of which logic 
can in strictness take cognisance though the 
term quality is properly restricted to the affirm 
ative or negative character of propositions yet 
we may without departing from this just restric 
tion treat in this place of the efiect of qualifying 
the quantity of a term t e of regarding it as in 
cluded or excluded and first of dichotomy 

dichotomy is the separation of the logical 
universe into two parts we take for instance 
x out of the imiverse what is left is notx 
these two complementary terms are called contra 
dictory terms their peculiar property is that they 
exclude one another and that the two together 
make up or exhaust the universe of thought they 
exclude each other since by including x we 
virtually exclude notx and by including notx 
we virtually exclude x they exhaust the imi 
verse because whatever is not x must be notx 
and whatever is not notx must be x 

now if after making a dichotomy of the uni 
verse x notx we seize on a common attribute 
of a part and a part only of the subclass x and 
thus dichotomise it into the contradictory parts y 

— 



 



of propositions 



and noty these last tenns are said to be con 
trary their peculiar property is that they agree 
in certain marks of the subclass but contradic 
torily differ in certain marks of the higher class y 
and that not only are they mutually exclusive in 
the class y but they are both excluded from the 
negative side of the first dichotomy notx 

let us illustrate this by reference to the table 
at page and take the summum genus a the 
universe consists of a b c and d and notna not j 
notc and not€ now from the a extract such 
individuals as have the marks a b c and d then 
all the individuals in are either b c and rf or 
not notc and notrf but these terms do not ex 
haust the universe they are contrary only te are 
contradictory in the subclass and in that only 

besides the symbols of quantity all and some 
i shall employ the symbol certain by which i 
mean some at least notall their contradictories 
are notall notany notcertain thus

terms

it may be objected that the negative propo 
sitions are ambiguously expressed we reply 
without the hyphen between the sign of quantity 
and the term the objection would be valid but 
with the hyphen we are convinced that no more 
precise modes of expressing these contradictories 
are to be foimd in the language however if it 
be considered desirable the negative propositions 
may be expressed as follows 

negative 

 somex is not somey 

 somex is not anyy 

 anyx is not somey 

 anyx is not anyy 

the word some in all these propositions 
means notnone perhaps au bearing this in

mind it is easy to discern that some of these pro 
positions are comprised in others according as an

tions to express the contradictories of the four 
affirmative propositions we may entertain a rea 
sonable doubt for example let aux is 
ally be the affirmative proposition now what 
is the proposition which denies this or in other 
words what is its contradictory the answer is 
 aux is not auy this is hardly english 
but in the absence of a native idiom it must suffice 
it means that the whole class x is not coincident 
with the whole class y and as all concepts refer 
to individual objects it denies that the same indi 
viduals constitute both classes this may happen 
in these cases only when there is one indivi 
dual at least in the class x which is not foimd 
in the class y or when one individual at least 
in the class y is not found in the class x or 
 when both and are concurrent or to take 
a concrete example let our fundamental proposi 
tion be allclovenfooted animals are somerumi 
nants the contradictory of this is established by 
the production of a sow which is clovenfooted but 
not ruminant or by the production of a hare which 
is ruminant but not clovenfooted or by the produc 
tion of both the contradictory therefore may be 
always expressed under one of the two following 
forms somecloven footed animals are not any 
ruminants and someruminants are not any 
elovenfooted so far all is clear but the difficulty 



 of propositions 

is in the attempt to express these two propositions 
in one the nearest approximption to the exact 
contradictory expressed in a native idiom is some 
clovenfooted animals axe not someruminants 
in using which we must always bear in mind 
that one of the signs of quantity may mean 
 any 

accordingly for all purposes of logic the pro 
position somex is not somey may be em 
ployed as the contradictory of the proposition 
 aux is auy by a similar train of reasoning 
it will readily appear that somex is not anyy 
is the contradictory of aux is somey also 
that anyx is not somey is the contradictory 
of somex is ally and lastly that anyx is 
not anyy is the contradictory of somex is 
somey to verify these assertions the reader is 
strongly recommended to examine closely the rels 
tions set forth in the table at page and besides 
the exercise of substituting for the symbolic propo 
sitions therein their equivalents derived from nature 
an exercise highly to be commended the student 
should experimentalise on the abstract formal pro 
positions being careful to give some its possible 
maximum value of ah in affirmative propositions 
and of any in negative propositions 

the advantages accruing from the quantifica 
tion of the predicate are innumerable not the 
least important of these is the result that all con 
version of propositions is simple by the term 
conversion logicians ordinarily understand a 



of propositions 

transposition of the terms and snch change of 
qnantitj or even of quality as is necessary to ren 
der the converted proposition the exact equivalent 
of the original one t e so that the former contains 
neither more nor less than the latter but with a 
quantified predicate no such change of quantity 
or quality is necessary to preserve unchanged the 
sense of the propositions in any proposition where 
both terms are quantified conversion is effected by 
simply transposing the terms with their quantitated 
adjuncts thus 

aux is ally aut is allx 
aux is somey somet is aux 
somex is auy auy is somex 
somex is somey somey is somex 

the student may readily satisfy himself of the 
fact that these observations are applicable to the 
four negative propositions 

in fact the effect of quantifying the predicate 
is the annihilation of all essential distinction be 
tween subject and predicate so that either term in 
a proposition may be made by conversion if 
iiecessary that of which the other is predicated 
let us investigate this result more closely take 
the proposition x is y in which no quantities 
appear what does this mean in extension it 
signifies x is contained under y in intension it 
signifies x comprehends in it y in the former 
case we mean that y is the larger logical whole 
and that x is subsumed imder it in the latter 



 op propositions 

case we mean that x is the greater metaphysical 
whole and that y is subordinated to it in the 
proposition then x is y in whichever whole 
we proceed x is the subject and y the predi 
cate now let us quantify both terms and it will 
appear that there is no longer any necessity for 
interpreting the copula differently according to the 
whole in which we proceed but that the copula 
becomes a mere sign of identity thus we say 
 aux is somey or somey is allx and 
similarly spmex is auy or auy is some 
x and the essential distinction between subject 
and predicate is no more similar remarks apply of 
course with as much force to negative propositions

 of propositions

in the process of generalisation we begin with 
the real individual objects logically regarded 
they are severally indivisible we cannot affirm of a 
that somea is not somea or of a that somea 
is not somea c we select from among those 
individuals a a a c being all that have the 
mark of infima species a we accordingly sub 
limate that group into the place of species we now 
select from among the marks of the a that mark 
which is next shallower and therefore wider than 
ar viz a and we accordingly sublimate the 
same group again viz to th subaltern genus but 
there are other individuals a a c which 
though not possessing so deep a mark a have 
the shallower mark and all such individuals 
we group under that name and sublimate at once 
to th subaltern genus vide nd column we now 
select from among the various attributes of the 
two groups a and the next shallower and 
therefore wider attribute than a viz a and 
these two groups we accordingly sublimate to th 
subaltern genus but there are other individuals 
a a a c which though lacking the deeper 
marks at and a possess the shallower mark a 
these we group and sublimate at once to the th 
subaltern genus vide rd column and so on imtil 
all our groups are found in the summum genus and 
as a finishing stroke all the individuals a a a c 
which lack the marks hr ar at a a a 
and a but possess the attribute a the shallow 
est and broadest of all are per sauum sublimated 
from the region of reality to the summum genus 



of pkopositions 

in employing this table it must be bome in 
mind that all propositions can be read in either 
whole without changing the sign of quantity 
thus alla is somea may be read either all a 
contains in it as attribute some a depth or 
all a contains imder it as constituent some a 
breadth 

terms have the same extension or are co 
extensive when they stand for the same objects 
thus man rational are coextensive because 
speaking of course with sole reference to beings 
of this world every man is rational and every 
rational is a man that is the same objects are 
denotedhj both terms 

terms have the same intension or are cointen 
sive when they stand for the same marks thus 
rood acre are cointensive because every mark 
except that of the extension possessed by a roodia 
likewise possessed by an acre and vice versa 
that is the same marks are connoted by both 
terms allman is allrational is the coex 
tensive relation between terms that are not co 
intensive allrood is someacre is the non 
coextensive relation between terms that are co 
intensive terms have equal extension or are 
equiextensive when the objects denoted by each 
are equally extensive 
thus 

justices of the court of queens bench 
and 

justices of the court of queens bench 



 op propositions 

are terms which are coextensive though in point 
of fact some only of the former are some only of 
the latter terms have equivalent intension or 
are equiintensive when the marks connoted by 
each are of equivalent degrees of generalisation 
thus triangular trilateral are terms which agree 
in connoting triplicity but the one connotes angu 
larity and the other laterality and angles and 
sides are of equivalent degrees of generalisation 
viz geometricaloftwodimensions 

in the first of the last two examples the terms 
are cointensive as well as equiextensive and 
in the second the terms are coextensive as well 
as equiextensive we might have chosen differ 
ently thus for the first we might have chosen 

 the relation between jiours on the dial and a jury 
no hours on the dial are any of a jury and 
for the second we might have chosen equilateral 
and equiangular which are not coextensive since 
for instance an equilateral parallelogram not a 
square is not equiangular 

now what is the bearing of these remarks on 
the last table carry the eye down the first 

file or column the groups a a a ca 
are composed of exactly the same individuals 
a a a c they are merely sublimated firom 
the species gradatim to the summum genus ac 
cording to the attributes they possess accord 
ingly we say that no two of the groups a a 
a c at are cointensive but they are all 
coextensive again carry the eye along the first 



op pbopositions 

rank or row the groups a a a c have 
precisely the same mark or marks a but they 
do not contain the same set of individuals among 
the aa a a a a c accordingly 
we say that all the groups a a a c are co 
intensive but no two of them are coextensive 

similar remarks apply of course to all the files 
and all the ranks 

for all the table says to the contrary however 
any two or more of the groups in one file may he 
equiintensive and any two or more of the groups 
in one rank raay he equiextensive 

now if we introduce the new quantity certain 
indicating partial definite or indefinite inclusion 
or partial definite or indefinite exclusion of the 
term to which it is prefixed we shall have to add 
ten propositions to the foregoing eight which are 
all as important in a logical point of view as those 
eight simply because they validly express actual 
judgments these ten are as follows 

affirmative negative 

aux is certainy aux is not certain y 

certainx is auy certainx is not auy 

certainx is certainy certainx is not cer 
somex is certainy tainy 

certainx is somey anyxis not certainy 

i certainx is not any y 
certain here means some at least notall it 
indicates a partial quantification whether definite 
or indefinite its value may be known or un 
known it may if you please be numerically 

il 



 op propositions 

exprimaue the propositions certainx is cer 
tainy and certainx is not certaint where 
 certain is a definite quantity are called nvmeri 
aajly dejinite propositions 

we now proceed to state according to sir 
william hamiltons masterly analysis the result 
and process of affirmation and negation and to 
contrast the two qualities according to the wholes 
in which they proceed in result affirmation is 
indusim and universal affirmation is absolute in 
clusion that is the inclusion of a definite this or 
all individual or class negation is exclusion 
and universal negation is absolute exclusion that 
is the exclusion of a definite this or all individual 
or class in process affirmation proceeds down 
wards or inwards from greatest to least from the 
constituted whole to the constituent parts nega 
tion proceeds upwards or outwards from least to 
greatest from the constituent parts to the consti 
tuted whole in coifuarasty in proportion to the 
intension is affirmation in proportion to the exten 
sion is negation at the maximum of extension 
there are predicated by affirmation least of the 
most that is there are given the fewest attributes 
to the greatest number of things by negation there 
are given the most of the least that is there are 
withdrawn the greatest number of attributes from 
the fewest fhings at the maximum of intension 
there are predicated by affirmation the most of the 
least that is there axe given the greatest number of 
attributes to the fewest things by negation there 



jof psopcnsinonsf 

are given the least of the most that is there are 
withdrawn the fewest attributes from the greatest 
nnmber of things hence in breadth to posit the 
genus is not to posit the species or the individual 
but to sublate the genus is to sublate the species 
and the individual also in depth to posit the in 
dividual is to posit the species and the genus but 
to sublate the individual is not to sublate the 
species or the genus 

in the foregoing exposition there is one point 
which demands elucidation the direction in 
which affirmation and negation proceed may be 
discerned from the following considerations hav 
ing regard to the table at page and reading it 
in breadth or extension an individual or class 
contained in any superior class saj the sixth 
subaltern genus is necessarily included in every 
higher genus but is not necessarily included in 
any lower class in order then to include it in 
such lower class we must make an affirmation in 
which such class stands as predicate that is we 
proceed downwards similarly if an individual 
or term be not contained in the sixth subaltern 
genus it is necessarily excluded from every inferior 
class but not necessarily excluded from any 
superior class accordingly if we wish to exclude 
it from such class we must make a negation in 
which such class stands as predicate that is we 
proceed upwards if the table be read in breadth 
the individual is greater than any class while the 
summum genus is the least class so that if in any 

— 



 of pkopositions 

affirmation or negation the signs of quantity be 
made to stand improperly no doubt for the inten 
sion of the terms to which they may be prefixed 
affirmation would proceed upwards and negation 
downwards but as we have already seen page 
 terms are only expressly quantified with refer 
ence to the logical whole of extension affirmation 
therefore is always downwards and negation up 
wards the former proceeds inwards towards the 
most intensive class the latter outwards to the 
most extensive class 

when in a proposition the quantity of both 
terms is definite whether universal or particular 
the judgment expressed thereby is called a defi 
nition of the most implicit of the two terms de 
finition may be of three kinds by the inten 
sion of the defined concept by its extension 
 by accidental coincidence examples of 
man is a being endowed with reason conscious 
ness freewill and understanding of britons 
are those that dwell in england scotland or 
wales of a triangle is a figure contained 
by three straight lines 

having now treated of the quantity of a term 
and the quality of a proposition we proceed to 
consider the relation of propositions relation is 
properly predicated of a plurality of propositions 
only it is of three kinds as follows 

independent 
relation qonjunqjtive of propositions 
disjunctive 



op propositiols 

independent propositions are of tiie following 
forms 

x is t and x is z or z is x 

x is t and y is z or z is t 

x is t and z is w or w is z 

in any of these forms the propositions in each 
pair though in two instances intemallj connected 
are categorically independent 

conjunctive propositions are of the following 
forms 

if x is t xis z or z is x 
if x is y y is z or z is y 
if x is y z is w or w is z 

in all these forms the latter proposition is con 
sequentially dependent on the former 

disjunctive propositions are of the following 
forms 

either x is y or x is z or z is x 
either x is y or y is z or z is y 
either x is y or z is w or w is z 

in each of these forms the propositions are 
consequentially exclusive of each other 



part m 



of illation 



we restrict the term illation to that kind of 
inference which is direct and immediate and we 
confine the term syllogism to that kind of infer 
ence which is indirect and mediate when from 
the consideration of one or more propositions in 
volving only two terms we are enabled to arrive 
at a judgment not formally identical with the 
ludsnoients expressed in such proposition or pro 
possons the process of arriig at the second 
judgment is called immediate inference or illation 

illation by oppositicn 

the simplest instance of this excluding con 
version which when the predicate is quantified 
is no inference at all are the inferences depend 
ing on logical opposition two propositions are 
said to be in opposition when the terms of each 
are the same while the one proposition is affirma 
tive and the other negative accordingly it fol 
lows that when any one of the following proposi 
tions viz 



of illation 



 



 affirmative 



 auxisallt 

 allx is somey 

 somex is auy 

 somex is somey 

is asserted simultaneously with any one of the fol 
lowing viz 

 somex is not somey 

 somex is not anyy 

 somey is not anyx 

 anyx is not anyy 

the two are in opposition 



negative 



the following are all the pairs that can be 
formed by taking one proposition from the affirma 
tives and one from the negatives 

 
 
sixteen in all 

those pairs that exclusively contradict each 
other are as we have already seen called contrar 
dictories the one proposition denying exactly that 
which the other affirms in contradictories more 
over there are always two terms indefinite and 
two definite those propositions in any pair 
which are inconsistent with each other without 
necessarily excluding each other are called con 
traries those propositions in any pair which are 
consistent with each other but whose contra 
dictories are contraries are called subcontraries 



 



op illatiok 



those propqsitions in any pair which may be 
simultaneously either inconsistent or consistent are 
called subalterns the remaining combinations of 
propositions two and two viz those in which 
there is no difference of quality both propositions 
being affirmative or both negative are not cases of 
opposition at all they will be treated of under 
another head illations by fluxion 

the cases of opposition above enumerated viz 
four contradictories five contraries five subcon 
traries and two subalterns that is sixteen in all 
appear in detail in the following tables in all 
such pairs some of course means some at least 
perhaps all however in investigating the con 
ditions of their solution we replace every some 
by certain

aux is somey 
isomex is not anyy 

f somex is auy

in each pair the pro 
positions cannot both 
be true at once or both 
false at once one of 
the two must be true 
and the other false

in each pair the pro

cannot both be true at 
once

in each pair the pro

cannot both be false at 
once

r aux is somey 
isomet is not anyx 

rsomex is auy 
somex is not anyy 



in each pair both 
propositions may be 
true at •nee or both 
may be false at once 



these tables may be greatly simplified it is 
observable that in the table of contraries the pro 
positions of each pair are the contradictories of 
those in a corresponding pair in the table of sub 
contraries thus 



contraries 

allx is auy 
anyx is not anyy 


subcontraries 
somex is not somey 
somex is somey 


aux is auy 
somex is not anyy 


somex is not somey

anyx is not anyy 


somex is not anyy 
somex is somey 


somex is auy 
anyx is not anyy 


omey is not anyx 
somex is somey 



similarly the propositions in either of the two 
pairs of subalterns are the contradictories of those 
each to each in the other thus 



allx is somey 
somey is not anyx 



somex is not anyy 
somex is auy 



of illation 



i contradictortes 



there is no condition of solubility of a pair of 
contradictories inasmuch as the propositions so 
opposed cannot be simultaneously true 

ii and iii contraries and suhcontraries 

if the propositions in any pair of contraries be 
ffjse those in its corresponding pair of suhcon 
traries are true we may therefore confine our 
attention to the pairs of suhcontraries 

 

somex is not somey

i append a couple of examples 

somecivilian is not somemilitaiy 
somecivilian is somemilitary 

therefore if certain members of parliament be 
the civilians who constitute a portion of the mili 
tary the class civilian is divisible into militaiy 
mps and notmilitary and the class military is 
divisible into military mps and notcivilian 

again 

allhuman is somebiped 
somebiped is not anyhuman 

therefore if birds be the bipeds who are not 
human the class biped is divisible into birds and 
men and the other bipeds if any

and if somex is ally be simultaneous 

and somex is not anyy j ly true 

certainx is ally are the resulting

in all these cases certain implies definite quan 
tity 

these solutions are of more importance in ap 
plied logic than their form would lead us to suppose 

in concluding our remarks on these instances 
of immediate inference we may call attention to 
the fact that in every case in which an inference is 
drawn immediately from two propositions we have 
 only to lay down the illative result as the original 
proposition and the two opposed propositions will 
form a double immediate inference therefrom 

we now proceed to consider 

illation by privation 

the following table will exhibit all possible 
assertorial inferences from the eight general propo 
sitions by writing for one or both terms its contra 
dictory or infinite complement 



 of illation 

 aux is auy 

ianyx is not anynott 
anynotx is not anyt 
aunotx is aunoty 

example to the just are all the holy 
 no just man is unholy no holy man is un 
just all unjust men axe all the unholy 

 allx is somey 
anyx is not anynoty 
anynotx is not somey 
somenotx is aunoty 



therefore 



example to all the righteous are happy 

 none of the righteous are unhappy some 
happy men are not unrighteous a who are 
not happy are not righteous 

 somex is auy 

isomex is not anynoty 
anynotx is not anyy 
aunotx is somenoty 

example to some happy persons are all 
the righteous somehappy persons are not un 
righteous no unhappy person is righteous 

 all who are unrighteous are unhappy 

 somex is somey 

rp p f somex is not anynoty 
 anynotx is not somey 

example to some desirable events are 
probable some desirable events axe not im 



of illation 

probable some probable events are not un 
desirable 

these are all the immediate assertorial infer 
ences by privation that can be drawn from affirm 
ative propositions 

it will be observed that each proposition except 
the fourth affords three inferences and no more 
when we proceed however to negative proposi 
tions the circmnstances are very different 

no negative proposition can yield more than 
two assertorial illations and one negative propo 
sition affords none at all 

 somex is not somey 

on this proposition no categorical immediate 
inference by privation can be drawn 

 somex is not anyy 

t • somex is somenoty 
therefore a„yotx i ot somenoty 

examples of some possible cases axe not 
probable some possible cases are improbable 
 some improbable cases are not impossible 

 anyx is not somey 

rp n fsomenotx is somey 

 somenotx is not anynoty 

examples of no probable case is some 
possible some impossible cases are some possi 
ble some improbable cases are not impossible 



 of illation 

 anyx is not anyy 



therefore 



aux is somenoty 
somenotx is auy 
certain indefinite notx is not any 

noty 
anynotx is not certain indefinite 

notx 



examples of no human virtue is perfect 
 all human virtues are imperfect all perfect 
virtues are unhuman certain imhuman virtues 
are not imperfect certain imperfect virtues are 
not unhuman 

besides assertorial inferences of this nature 
there are copious hypothetical inferences namely 
conjunctive disjunctive and both together one 
example of this large family of illatives will suf 
fice 

take the proposition anyx is not anyy 
it is susceptible of the following conjunctive in 
ference if both the propositions allnotx is 
aupy and aux is aunoty be untrue then 
somenotx is somenoty 

it is evident that instances of this kind of 
illation might be multiplied ad infinitum we 
proceed then to 

illation by fluxion 

by this we mean to speak of immediate infer 
ences derivable firom the above eight propositions 



of illation 

hy supposing a quantity to shrink or swell that is 
decrease or increase towards the limits zero and 
infinity or towards the limit individual and uni

 op illation 

the following are examples of complex flux 

ional illation 

 

jaiix is somet and 

somex is auy 

therefore aux is ailt 
again 

jsomex is not anyt and 

anyx is not somey 

therefore somex is not somey 
numerous examples might be given from the 
same table of hypothetical illation thus from 
the proposition 

aux is not ally 

we have the disjunctive inference 

either somex is not anyy 
or anyx is not somey 

and the conjimctive inferences 

if somex is certain y 

then anyx is not somey and also 

if certainx is somey 
then somex is not anyy 

instances of this kind may be multipued to a 
great extent their amplification will be good 
practice for the student 

there is yet another class of fluxional illa 
tions 

the ordinary hypothetical syllogism as it is 
improperly called is as sir william hamilton 



op illation 

obeites no syllogism at all but merely an im 
mediate inference it is either conjunctive or dis 
junctive the conjunctive illation is of this kind 

ifwisx tisz 

but w is x 
therefore t is z 

there are however many other forms of this 
illation 

the disjimctive illation is of this kind 

w is either x t or z 

but w is not x or y 

therefore w is z 

with many other forms 

that these illations are nothing more than im 
mediate inferences is readily seen by transforming 
them thus 

let w x be u and y z be v 

then the conjimctive illation becomes 

auu is somev 
someu is somev 

which is an illation by fluxion 

again let us resolve the disjunctive premise 

w is either x y or z into its constituent 
propositions these are 

if w is x it is not y or z 
ik w is y or z it is not x 

 



li 



 op illation 






if w is tit is not x or z 
if w is x or z it is not y 

if w is z it is not x or t 
w is x or y it is not z 

the first pair means 

all cases of w is x is all cases of w is not y 
jgid w is not z 

the second pair tneans 

all cases of w is t is all cases of w is not x 
and w is not z 

the third pair means 

all cases of w is z is all cases of w is not x 
and w is not t 

now let w x be u w y be v and w z 
be q 

then we have 

auu is allnotv fl 
allv is aunotu fl 
aua is allnotu v 

which are three equivalent forms of the same ex 
pressions the illation being by privation 

any one then may stand as sumption in the 
disjunctive illation 

let auo is allnotu v be the sumption 

then someq is somenotu v is an illa 
tion by fluxion 

logicians reckon many other kinds of imme 
diate inference besides those we have mentioned 
all of them however are questionable 



of illation 



 



immediate inferences to which we deny the 
name of syuogisms have been called by kant 
 syllogisms of the understanding 

it must be careftdly borne in mind that though 
an immediate inference from a given proposition 
may immensely facilitate the process of reasoning 
yet that the neglect to do so will ijiever reduce the 
constituent parts of a system of ratiocination to 
enthymeme or sorites for the meaning of these 
words see whately bk ii c § 



paet iv 
of the syllogism 

the term syllogism is here restricted to mean 
the expression of an argument in which it is neces 
sary to compare two terms with a third term in 
order to determine the relation between those two 
terms this kind of inference is said to be medi 
ate and the third term with which the other two 
are compared is called the middle term thus 
if it be suspected that bitter beer is deleterious 
we should be unable to convert that suspicion into 
a certainty until we had found that it contains 
strychnine or some other determined deleterious 
drug this argument which all men go through 
every day of their lives is logically expressed as 
follows bitter beer contains stiychnine every 
liquid that contains strychnine is deleterious there 
fore bitter beer is deleterious 

in all such arguments it is evident that there 
must be two propositions which whatever other 
points of similarity or dissimilarity they may have 
agree in this that they both involve the middle 
term and disagree in this that they connect the 



of the stllogism 

middle tenn with different terms thi gbiienl 

canon of mediate inference is this 

the agreement or disagreement of one concept 
with another is ascertained by a third concept in 
asmuch as this wholly or in part agrees with both 
or with only one of the concepts to be compared 

the syllogism may accordingly be defined to 
be a formula of comparison of any two concepts 
with or through the medium of a third in order 
to ascertain whether they agree or not 

every syllogism therefore consists of three pro 
positions involying the three terms divers names 
have been employed by logicians to particularize 
these propositions and terms the following names 
appear to deserve the preference the most exten 
sive or most comprehensive of the two propositions 
from which the third is inferred we call the sump 
tion the other of those two we call the sub 
sumption the sumption and subsmpption we 
call the premises and the resulting proposition 
we call the consequence the term that is com 
mon to the premises which in most ancient writers 
is called the argument we have called the middle 
term in acquiescence with modem usage the 
term involved in the sumption besides the middle 
term we call the major term and the term in 
volved in the subsumption besides the middle 
term we call the minor term example all 
men are mortal gabriel was not mortal there 
fore gabriel wa not a man here man is the 
major tm gabriel the minor term they are 



 of the sylloaislt 

compared ttrough the medium of mortal which 
is therefore the middle term all men are mortal 
is the most extensive premise and as jhe syllo 
gism is in the logical whole of extension this is 
the sumption and gabriel is not mortal is the 
subsumption gabriel is not a man is the con 
sequence 

 not only must every syllogism as we have 
said contain three terms and no more and three 
propositions and no more but of the premises one 
at least must be affirmative moreover the conse 
quence must express the worst relation of the two 
terms with the middle term if one of the premises 
be negative the consequence must also be nega 
tive the comparison of each of the two terms 
must be with either the whole or some part of the 
middle term neither term must be distributed 
in the consequence that is imiversally affirmed or 
denied unless it has been so in the premise in 
volving it all these conditions are involved in 
the above canon for the copious illustration of 
all these points the student is referred to thomsons 
laws of thought § 

the necessity of quantifying the predicates of 
the sumption the subsumption and the conse 
quence of a syllogism may be easily shewn for 
since thesyllogism is but a means of stating the 
afgument or disagreement of two terms by means 
of their agreement or disagreement with a third 
it is imperative that the extent of these terms 
themselves should be taken into account apart 



of the syllogism 

fixm this there can be no measurement of extent 
and no conclusion of identity or difference of ex 
tent as the result of such measurement and there 
fore no conclusion of scientific significance the 
implicit quantification of the predicate has accord 
ingly been always held by logicians though they 
have with well nigh one consent most illogically 
rejected its explicit quantification as there is still 
some hesitation on their part to allow the claims 
of the new doctrine in reference to the syllogism 
i will enter into a more detailed demonstration of 
its truth 

in any syllogism the process of the reasoning 
and the evidence of its validity is the same and 
it is the following the middle term is the mean or 
measure in the first place one extreme is compared 
with the middle term and seen to agree with it so 
far then the other extreme is compared with the 
middle and also seen to agree with it so far and 
thereupon this identity of agreement is affirmed 
but in either case if i do not know the extent of 
the term compared cannot take it that is in some 
definite extent i cannot tell how far it agrees with 
the middle or again if i do not know the ex 
tent of the middle term cannot take it in some 
definite extent i cannot tell whether the term to 
be compared agrees with it in extent or not — 
whether it is part or whole or none the predi 
cate notion however in every reasoning is one of 
these terms and stands in one of these relations 
it is therefore absolutely necessary as we have 



 of the stlloaish 

said to the validity of the reasoning that the pre 
dicate should always be quantified baynes 
the incidents of the syllogism are 

 subordination of propositions 

 figilre 

 mood 

 action or motion 

 the syllogism may be deductive or induc 
tive but unta further notice when we speak of 
the syllogism we mean the deductive syllogism 

in the syllogism then the sumption must stand 
first and the subsumption must occupy the subor 
dinate place this distinction however may be lost 
sight of in dealing with the empty formulae of the 
syllogism where in point of fact any proposition 
may stead as sumption the form in which a 
proposition appears in the syllogism is of more im 
portance than the order of the propositions the 
english language generally requires that the 
second term in anyafltanative proposition in ex 
tension should be more extensive than the first 
but even this distinction may for the present be 
lost sight of and we may assume that any propo 
sition and its converse are equally admissible in 
the syllogism 

 the figure of a syllogism depends solely 
on the relative position of the middle term 

the figures are three in number in the first 
figure the middle term is the subject of the 
sumption and the predicate of the subsumption 
in the second figure the middle term stands as 



of the syllogism 

predicate in both premises in the third figure 
the middle term stands as subject in both pre 
mises 

galen on insufficient authority has had the 
credit or discredit of adding to these a fourth 
figure which through the lack of independence in 
logical speculation held an unquestioned place in 
modem treatises on logic until its claims were 
disputed and finally overthrown by sir willism 
hamilton in this supposititious figure the middle 
term was said to be the predicate of the sumption 
and the subject of the subsumption 

the real fact is that when a syllogism appears 
in this spurious figure one has simply to transpose 
the order of the premises to reduce the syllogism 
to the first figure and it is somewhat remarkable 
though perhaps never before remarked that if in 
the premises and consequence the more extensive 
term occupy the place of predicate there can be 
only one syllogism appearing in the fourth figure 
that is not reducible to the first figure namely 
the following 

j anyt is not anyx 
t auy issomez 

therefore somez is not anyx 

this of course is in the third figure but it will 
be also observed that the syllogism is redundant in 
the subsumption and that the same consequence 
would follow if the subsumption were somez is 
somet if this proposition stand as subsump 



 op the syllogism 

tion in the above syllogism the argument is 
ahready in the first figure 

each figure has its own peculiar canon 

canon of first figure in so far as two concepts 
are related either both positively or one positively 
and the other negatively to a common term of 
which the one is subject and the other predicate 
so far are these two concepts related positively 
or negatively to each other as subject and pre 
dicate 

canon of second figure in so far as two con 
cepts both subjects are either both positively or 
the one positively and the other negatively related 
to a common predicate so far are they either posi 
tively or negatively indifierently subject and predi 
cate of each other 

canon of third figure in so far as two con 
cepts both predicates are either both positively 
oi the one positively and the other negatively 
related to a common subject in so far arjb they 
positively or negatively indifferently subject and 
predicate of each other 

 the mood of a syllogism is determined by 
the quantity of the two terms and the quality of 
the two propositions which stand as sumption and 
subsumption 

the moods of each figure are thirtysix in 
ntimber of which twelve have positive conse 
quences and of these twelve seven are redundant 
ind twentyfour have negative consequences of 
which twentyfour twelve are redundant

the quantity all in brackets in tlie table of 
smrplos moods indicates a redundant distribution 
if some be written for all tbe consequence 
drawn is tbe same 

the sign standing between two syllogisms 
indicates that they are congruoua that is that if 
in either syllopsm x be written for z and z for 
x the other results 

from the above tables of moods in the first 

fioiire tables of moods in the second figure are 

y simply converting the sumption and 

uoods in the third figure by converting 

ptwn 

e purposes of natural expression it is 
to observe the rule of writing every 
proposition in soch order of terms as 
the most extensitq term the predicate 



op the syllogism 

for example we prefer to say aux is somey 
rather than the converse because t is the broader 
term a fact indicated by the quantity of both 
terms 

but on the other hand in negative propo 
sitions we prefer saying somex is not anyy 
 rather than the converse when both terms are 
definite however as aux is ally and anyx 
is not anyy it is indifferent in which order the 
terms stand as in the latter case we say nox 
is y and noy is x indifferently and a 
similar remark applies to propositions in which 
both terms are indefinite as somex is somey 
 somex is not somey 

the fallowing table contains the moods appli 
cable to any one or two of the figures or to all 
three of them the distinctions axe grounded 
upon two assumptions first that every propo 
sition shall stand in the natural order of the terms 
according to the english language secondly 
that congruous propositions shall be regarded as 
only one form of ratiocination 

for this purpose and especially with a view to 
avoid any particular succession of the major and 
minor terms let us write g and t for the major 
or minor terms either being major or minor at 
pleasure and we retain y as the sign of the 
middle term 

the following table then exhibits all the essen 
tially distinct moods of syllogism of which the 
english language is susceptible

in all then there are nine essential moods 

the following points must be carefully kept in 
view in studying this table 



j 



of the sxllomsm 

lat that in the form of syllogism it is indif 
ferent which of the extreme terms is major and 
which is minor in fact that g and t really 
differ in some point either in quantity and kind or 
in kind only but as to the difference in kind we 
know nothing whatever about it we know that 
there is such a difference and that is all 

ndly that in such form it is indifferent 
which premise is sumption and which is sub 
sumption 

rdly that the figure of the syllogism is 
only an unessential variety and becomes of mo 
ment only in consequence of the peculiar idiom of 
the language in which the reasoning is expressed 

thly that the english language in certain 
forms of affirmation and negation necessitates a 
particular order of terms and that this order is 
strictly observed in the above table 

thly that wherever a mood is competent for 
the first figure its exemplar is written in that 
figure that figure being at once the most formal 
and the most natural 

besides the thirtysix moods already investi 
gated there are twelve combinationa firom which 
no inference can be drawn viz 

somet is aux somet is somex 

somez is somey c auz is somey 



— 



 of the tllgism 

someyis aux 
auz issomey 



somey is somex 
somez is somey 



somey is allx somey is not somex 

somez is not somey auz is somey 



somey is allx spme y is not anyx 

anyz is not somey allz is somey 



somey is somex somey is not somex 

somez is not somey somez is somey 



somey is somex somey is not anyx 

anyz is not somey x somez is somey 



the reason why no third proposition in z and 
 x results from any of these twelve pairs is that in 
each case aristotles principle fails which requires 
that the middle term y shall be distributed ie 
universally predicated in one of the premises in 



of the syllogism 

all these twelve pairs the middle tenn has in both 
premises the indefinite quantity some 

the feint of drawing an inference in such cases 
is called the fallacy of the undistributed middle 
the following are examples of it 

l 

someyis allx 
auz issomet 



nonsequitur auz is aux 



somecases of rarefaction are caused by heat 
allcomets are cases of rarefaction 

 allcomets are rarefied by heat 

ii 

someyis aux 
¦ auz issomey 



hon sequitur auz is somex 

somecases of rarefaction are derived from other 

causes than heat 
allcomets are somecases of rarefaction 

• allcomets are rarefied by something else than 
heat 

aux is somew 

auz is somex firom 

auz is somew 



 of the syllogism 

all bodies undergoing rarefaction from some 

other cause than heat are cooled down 
allcomets are so rarefied 

 all comets by rarefaction are cooled down 

here the effect x excludes the effect w 
that is if the comet by rarefaction be made hotter 
it cannot be made cooler the same informal con 
cluding thus gives birth to opposite conclusions 

 iii 

somey is allx 
some or auz is auy 



somez is somex 



heat is caused by th proximity of comets 
it is hot today 

 comets are near the earth today 

iv 

somex is auy 
somez is allx 



somez is auy 



comets are discernible in hot weather 
today comets are seen 

• today it is hot 

now if for some wherever it is the quantity 
of the middle term y we write certain in the 



of the stllogish 

sense of partial quantity definite or indefinite and if 
we suppose that the certain y of the one premise 
in any pair together with the certainy of the 
other premise in that pair do together exceed the 
universal quantity of y then an inference can be 
drawn which extends to a quantity of y at least 
equal to the difference between the two certains 
in few words we say if of two propositions the 
middle term be not distributed as predicate in either 
but if it be quantified in both and the sum of its 
quantities exceed its universal quantity a conse 
quent may be drawn this is called the principle 
of the ultratotal qiuintification of the middle term 
for example 

half the brigade were slain 
a majority of the brigade were brave 

some brave men were slain 



i e — — y is somex 
 

 — y is somez 



somez is somex 



bearing in mind this condition of the over 
lapping of partial definites we may write all the 
twelve moods which have been dismissed as in 
competent and state the consequents 

 finrt schematised by lambert named by sir w hamilton 



 of the syllogism 

let certain in the one premise be definite or 
indefinite and certain in the other premise be 
greater than the diflference between au and certain 
in the first or vice versa 

then the following twelve additional moods 
are valid five being sufficient and seven redmi

writing each pair of congruous syllogisms as

the following represent the three valid sufficient

the syllogism is sometimes presented under a 
form involving six or perhaps more terms each 



 op the syllogism 

premise exhibiting two or perhaps more proposi 
tions hypothetically connectei accordingly some 
writers on logic have treated of these syllogisms 
under the head of hypothetical but the fact is 
that all such are immediately reducible to the 
assertorial form the following are examples of 
this class of syllogisms 

in all cases where u is v y is z 
in all cases where w is x u is v 

in all cases where w is x y is z 

in all cases where u is v y is z 
in some cases where w is x u is v 

in some cases where w is x y is z 

in all cases where u is v y is z 
in some cases where u is v w is x 

in some cases where w is x y is z 

in all cases where y is z u is v 
in all cases where u is v w is x 

in some cases where w is x y is z 

now in these formulae if u with the attribute 
v be u t with the attribute z be y 
and w with the attribute x be w these syllo 
gisms are reduced to the following assertorial forms 

allu is somey 
auw is someu 



auw is somey

somew is someu 



somew is somey 

auu is somey

ally is someu

it is obvious that by reference to the tables of 
moods hypothetical syllogisms may be multiplied 
without limit 

the syllogisms that we have already treated of 
are designated figured syllogisms in contradis 
tinction to another class which we have hitherto 
kept out of sight 

the canon of the unfignred syllogism is the 
following 

in as far as two concepts either both agreeing 
or one agreeing the other does not with a common 
third concept in so far these notions do or do not 
agree with each other 

the unfigured syllogism in the terms g y 
 r expiresses either that g and yare tdenticaly that 
is the same in kind and quantity or not identical 
as the case may be and that y and t are identical 
or not identical and that therefore g and t are 
identical or not identical as the case may be or 



 op the sylloaism 

on the other hand that g and y are the same in 
kind but that g is in y and that y and f are the 
same in kind but that y is in f and therefore 
that g is in f or that g y and f being of the 
same kind y is in g and f is in y and therefore 
that f is in g 

in such syllogisms there are indeed two ex 
treme terms and a middle term but no term is 
subject or predicate in any proposition and it will 
be often found that the attempt to reduce the un 
figured syllogism to the figured is fraught with 
complexity and redundancy if not with absurdity 

the student may for practice try the experi 
ment of throwing the unfigured syllogism hhe 
fruit is bigger than the stone the stone is bigger 
than the kernel therefore the fruit is bigger than 
the kernel into a figured syllogism 

syllogisms besides being figured and unfigured 
are also analytic and synthetic in the former 
which is the most natural method of reasoning the 
consequence is expressed first and the premises 
then stated as its reasons in the latter which is 
that cultivated by logicians and to which there 
fore exclusively all logical nomenclature is rela 
tive the premises precede and as it were effectu 
ate the consequence example if it be asked 
is z in x we reply analytically yes for z is 
in y and y is in x but synthetically we should 
reply yes for y is in x and z isin y the syl 
logisms in both cases being unfigured 



paet v 

of chains of reasoning deductive 

and inductive 

in rendering logical processes subservient to 
purposes of science the mode of procedure is to 
a certain extent determined bj the nature of the 
subjectmatter 

to that extent therefore the discussion of me 
thod is excluded from a treatise on formal logic 

the pure logical aspects of continuous chains of 
reasoning are but two 

reasoning may be analytic or synthetic it 
may be deductive or inductive 

for the sake of perspicuity we will first inves 
tigate the distinction between deductive and in 
ductive reasoning 

in deduction we reason from the whole to the 
parts from the genus to the species from the 
species to the individual 

all the forms of syllogism with which we have 
had as yet to deal are deductive 

the deductive syllogism may be figured or 
unfigured 



 of chains op beasonika 

in a simple chain of deductive syuogisms we 
start from the greatest whole either in extension 
or comprehension and we terminate with an indi 
vidual olgect or the allembracing attribute 

induction on the other hand is reasoning from 
the parts to the whole from the individual to the 
species from the species to the genus the induc 
tive syllogism is in one figure only in a simple 
chain of inductive syllogisms we start from the in 
dividual objects or the shallowest attributes and 
we reason to the most extensive class or to the 
most complex object extension or intension ac 
cordingly employing for the sake of illustration 
the whole of extension only we may descend 
from the most extensive whole to the smallest con 
stituent parts by a chain of deductive syllogisms 
and we may ascend through the same series back 
to the greatest whole by a chain of inductive syllo 
gisms or on the other hand we may first ascend 
by induction and then descend by deduction 
these two logical procedures are as it were the 
converse of each other hopeless then nay absurd 
must appear the attempt of nearly all locians to 
assimilate the one procedure to the other 

some have endeavoured to shew that the in 
ductive syllogism belongs to the third figure 
others that it ought to be classed with hypotheti 
cals both views are manifestly erroneous let 
us take examples of a single inductive and a single 
deductive syllogism in extension the two being 
the converse of each other 



deductive and inducttive 

inductive deductive 

aub is somea 



c c cf are somea 

c c cf are aub 

 allb is somea 



c c c are some or allb 
 c c c are somea 



in the inductive syllogism the predicate of the 
second premise must be universal or in other 
words c cf cf must be constituents of a given 
whole when this is the case the induction is said 
to be complete it is worthy of observation that 
if this predicate be indefinite no conclusion can be 
drawn the premises c cf are somea and 
c cfy cf are someb being incompetent for ex 
ample 

isaac levi and abraham are avaricious 
isaac levi and abraham are allthejews 
 all jews are avaricious 

this conclusion is just but if the three indi 
viduals named do not constitute all the jews no 
conclusion at all can be drawn it is true that by 
indefinitely increasing the number of individuals 
that collectively form the subject of both premises 
that is by indefinitely approximating to the uni 
verse of jews the conclusion can be made more 
and more probable but until our induction ex 
hausts the universe that is until we have found 
every individual jew to be avaricious we have no 
right to predicate that fact apodictically and it 
must be remembered that logic deals with none 
but necessary reasoning 



 of chains of beasonikg 

we maj extend what has been said on the in 
ductive syllogism to chains of reasoning of all 
aorts the simplest case is where the individnals 
if if iy belong to a species s that species to a 
genus to a genus fi and to a snmmnm genns 
a or we may extend the generalisation still higher 
in the example given the following are the induc 
tive and deductive series respectively 

inductive dedtictive 

f € are somea all is somea 

 are aus 

all is somea 



aus is somea 
all is somey 



all 


ia some 


auy

homeyis somea 

someyis somea 
all is some 

someis somea 

it is seldom in the application of logic to 
science that any inductive operation involving a 
longer chain of syllogisms is employed the diffi 
culty and complexity of an inductive process lies 
in something else than the length of the chain of 
reasoning or in any of the formal details of the 
syllogisms employed 

in the domain of nature everything is pre 
sented to us under the forms of substance and acci 
dent cause and effect or action and reaction 



deductive and inductive 

under the first form our judgments are assertorial 
that is a predicate is simply afbrmed or denied of 
a subject under the second form our judgments 
are conjunctive one proposition being affirmed or 
denied as the consequence of another of which it 
is logically independent under the third form our 
judgments are disjunctive an alternative being 
presented between two or more propositions now 
in point of fact these three forms are cognizable 
under a single form since the accident may always 
be affirmed or denied as the effect of the sub 
stance and in the case of action and reaction either 
may stand as cause and the other as effect ac 
cordingly in the investigation of nature with a 
view to determine the dependence of phenomena 
upon each other the occupation of the observer and 
inductive reasoner is commonly called the search 
after causes now as logic can take no cognizance 
of the content or matter contained in any term or 
proposition it is manifestly out of its province to 
inquire whether two phenomena presented in the 
form of propositions are connected by the relation 
of substance and accident cause and effect or ac 
tion and reaction the business of logic is simply 
to consider the relation of identity subsisting be 
tween two or more propositions formally distinct 

we proceed then to investigate the syllogistic 
forms hypothetical of course under which the in 
ductive philosophy can conclude from observation 
and experiment that two observed phenomena are 
universally connected in a certain manner 
i l 






 op the syllogism 

it is of course assumed that the laws of nature 
are constant and that the like effects follow the 
like causes in the absence of neutralising or modi 
fying concurrent causes it is by virtue of this 
assumption that the conclusions are invested with 
the character of universality 

now let us assume that we ar presented with 
a given instance which is analysed and resolved 
into four phenomena x x x and z let z be 
the phenomenon whose cause we seek and let x 
and x be two assigned causes selected on account 
of some apparent probability that one or other is 
the cause we seek then x is called the resi 
dual phenomenon and of course if neither x nor 
x be the cause sought that cause will be found 
among the constituents of the residual phenomenon 
now let us suppose that the circumstances of the 
case permit us to experimentalize on the effect of 
any two of the three constituents x x and x 
then the following are the only possible results 

i xandxgivez xandxgive z x and xdo not give z 
il xand xgivez xandx do not give z xand x give z 

iii xandxdo notgivez xand xdo not give z xand xgivez 

iv xandxdonotgivez xandxgive z xand x do not give z 
v xandxdo notgivez x and x give z x and x give z 

tl xandxgivezxandxdonotgivez xandxdo notgivez 
vil xandxgivez x and x give z xandxgive z 

these are the only practicable combinations 
from i it follows that x is the caaise sought 



of the stllogism 

from ii that x is the cause sought froin iii 
it follows that x is a contradictoiy cause and 
from iv that x is a contradictory cause from 
v we learn that the required cause is to be sought 
for in the residual phenomenon and from vi 
that the residual phenomenon contains a contra 
dictory cause from vii we learn that x x 
and x are all three equivalent causes these 
results are susceptible of a syllogistic schema 
tism 

let the concurrence of x and x present the 
phenomenon y let the concurrence of x and 
x present the phenomenon y and let the con 
currence of x and x present the phenomenon 
y then from i we have the following sche 
matism 

in all cases where y is z is 

in all cases where y is x is not 

therefore in some cases where z is x is not 

in all cases where y is z is 

in some cases where y is x is not 

therefore in some cases where z is x is not 



either in all cases where z is x is or in all cases where z is 
x is or in all cases where z is x is 

but in some cases where z is x is not and in some cases where 
z is x is not 



therefore in all cases where z is x is 



in this disjunctive idation the truth of the 
sumption depends on the fact that x x and x 



 

 



 of the syllogism 

comprise the whole universe of phenomena of 
course no induction can extend so far as that in 
practice the major premiss in question is of pro 
blematical modality only but logic as we have 
seen takes no cognizance of the problematioal or 
presumptive but only of the assertorial 

from u we have the following schematiatu 

in all cases where y ia z is 

in all cases where y is x is not 



therefore in some cases where z is ji is not 

in all cases where y is z is 
in all cases where y is x is not 

therefore in some cases where z is x is not 

either in all cases where z is x is or in all cases wbers z b 
x is or in all cases where z is x is 

but in some cases where z is x is not and in some cases where 
z is x is not 

therefore in all cases where z is x is 



from iii we have the following schematism 

in all cases where y is not z is 
in all cases where y is z is not 

therefore in some cases where not z is x is not 

in all cases where y is not z is 
in all cases where y is x is not 



therefore in some cases where not z is x is not 



either in all cases where not z is x is or in all cases where 
not z is x is or in all cases where not z is x is 









op the syllogism 

but in some cases where not z is x is not and in some cases 
where not z is x is not 

therefore in all cases where not z is x is 



from iv we have the following schematism 

in all cases whre y is not z is 
in tjl oeks where y is x is not 



therefore in some cases where not z is x is not 

in all cases where y is not z is 
in all cases where y is x is not 



therefore in some cases where z is x is not 

either in all cases where not z is x is or in all cases where 
not z is x is or in all oases where z is x is 

but in some cases where not z is x is not and in some cases 
where not z is x is not 

therefore in all cases where not z is x is 

in a similar manner the schematisms v and vi 
might be written the conclusions from v viz 
where z is x is merely informs ns that the 
cause of z is to be sought for in x the residual 
phenomenon 

the conclusion from vi where notz is x 
is merely informs us that in the residual pheno 
menon x there is a cause but for which z would 
be present the result of vii shews that the se 
lection of assumed causes x and x was unskilfdl 
or unlucky and recourse must e had again to 
experiment

 of the syllogism 

syllogistna hy hypothesis 

syllogiams are often employed hypothetically 
in a ciain of reasoning the following example 
may serve for an illubtration to prove that if 
there are more hairy people in the world than 
hairs on any one two persons at least must have 
the same numler of hairs 

i 

simple illation 

all the hairy people are more in nnmber than the 

hairs of any one datum 
therefore all the hairy people in the world are 

more in number than the hairs on a 

ii 

the number of hairs on a is equal to the number 
of different mimlders of haira from to the 
number a has mathematical truth 

 the hairy people in the world are more in 
number than the hairs on a consequent of i 

lerefore all the hairy people in the world are 
more in number than the different numbers of 
hairs from to the number of hairs on a 

the next is an assertorial syllogism hypothe 
ally posited 



of the syllogism 

iii 

let every one of the hairy people in the world 
have a different number of hairs from the num 
ber on any one else hypothesis 

all the hairy people in the world are more in 
number than the different number of hairs 
from to the number a has consequent of ii 

therefore some one at least of the hairy people 
in the world have higher number of hairs on 
them than the number a has 

iv 

disjunctive illation 

either each of the hairy people in the world has a 
different number of hairs from that on any one 
else or some two at least have the same 
number of hairs mathematical truth 

but if the first alternative be true there are some 
one at least who have higher numbers of 
hairs on them than the number a has which 
is the contradictory of the datum 

therefore some two at least have the same num 
ber of hairs 

this example which belongs rather to applied 
than to formal logic is introduced with the view 
of shewing in a small compass the value of a 
suppository assertorial syllogism the use made 

 is not this the syllogisrm which aristotle calls i inroa€a 



 of the syllogism 

of it in the preceding example is called die 
reductio ad absurdum 

without infringing on the sphere of applied 
logic it is difficult to discuss the subject of ana 
lysis and synthesis as methods of teaching science 
and of investigating scientific truths whether 
the names be well or ill applied as discriminating 
between algebraical and geometrical processes is 
a matter of great doubt we have already em 
ployed these terms to designate the direct and 
inverse methods of stating an argument see 
p the student must carefully bear in mind 
that no such sense is to be attributed to the terms 
analytical and synthetical as applied to distinguish 
such processes as those of algebra and geometry 
i specify algebra and geometry simply because 
these are the only sciences in which the two 
processes we are speaking of are exhibited in per 
fection 

in the opinion of the writer both those pro 
cesses are deductive and further that there is no 
logical difference between them in other words 
they differ only in their subject matter
