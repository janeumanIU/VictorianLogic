preface 



for some years past i have been 
occasionally writing essays on different 
subjects in the hope of being able one 
day or other to publish them of these 
the present work is a specimen but 
as i proceeded so many considerations 
pressed upon me that i could not confine 
it within tne ordinary limits and it insen 
sibly swelled into a small book instead 
of being only part of one containing 
several essays 

this will account for some circum 
stances that seem to require explanation 
had i originally intended it for a separate 
volume i should have been more atten 
tive to form and arrangement and to what 
regards chapters or particular divisions 
it is evidently deficient in that regular 
connexion which constitutes a book as the 
extended appendix shows to make 
some amends therefore for the conse 
quent inconvenience in perusal i vm 



preface 

given a longer table of contents than so 
small a work might otherwise appear to 
demand 

what i have now said will also as i 
should hope excuse me in another respect 
it first i designed only to explain for 
ordinary capacities that long enslave 
ment of the human faculties which is 
rarely understood by common readers 
my intention was to confine myself solely 
to that but as i went on and being 
obliged to consult authors of various con 
flicting opinions i found the strongest 
arguments for the syllogistic theory so 
weak that t could no longer restrain 
myself on that point i considered that 
it would be a dereliction of my duty not 
to express my real sentiments and i at 
length proceeded to language of the most 
unreserved and decided character this 
has made my treatise appear in some 
instances rather inconsistent i was at 
first afraid of my own prejudices against 
that theory and i spoke of it in qualified 
terms compared to what i afterwards 
used yet on reviewing the whole i 
did not make any alteration — not even in 
the title it is perhaps best to begin 
somewhat mildly and to gradually in 
crease the strength of expression i am 
glad therefore that i did not think of 



preface 

dr whatelys work on logic till i was 
pretty far advanced had looked into 
it earlier i might not have been able to 
gpeak of aristotle with proper respect 
for though i was never peripatetically 
inclined i must own that i approached 
him with timidity but on reading dr 
whatelys treatise i gave all my scruples 
to the wind never was there a work 
better calculated in my opinion to make 
any thinking man a decided baconian 
though its object is directly the reverse 

as to attaining the end for which i 
originally took up my pen i must of 
course wait with patience for the result 
but let that be what it may deem no 
apology whatsoever necessary for my un 
dertaking this work no one will deny 
the importance of explaining for humble 
capacities the years enslavement 
of the human mind and as i can boldly 
assert that every similar attempt has 
hitherto failed it should be followed up 
till successful 

my strictures on the classics flowed 
naturally from considering logic as a 
subject of tuition and from viewing them 
as also materially affecting the morals 
they will probably appear extraneous 
for admit that they came unexpectedly 
and did not form any part of my first 



preface 

design it is for tlie public to pronounce 
on the propriety of their introduction here 
and to decide whether the time is come 
when the satyrlike absurdity of praising 
and teaching pagan and christian morality 
both together in the same breath should 
be reprobated 

the public being quite unused to find 
an author without some tincture of vanity 
and as i have no ambition to set myself 
up for an exception i may be allowed to 
mention that i now follow the principles 
laid down in my work on composition 
and punctuation but as it would be 
unpardonable to enlarge on them here i 
shall only observe that their principal 
features are the exclusion of the colon 
semicolon parenthesis and notes in the 
text pages

logic 



preliminary explanation 

there are always many persons of humble 
attainments or rather of confined education who 
are nevertheless exceedingly anxious for some 
acquaintance with the higher branches of litera 
ture but however laudable their desires they 
are most comnonly disappinted if they in 
quire of the learned they are just as wise as 
fore for some how or other your learned 
men can seldom make themsdves intelligible 
except to those who are conversant with the 
matter in question — that is if you already know 
it they will explain it further the only resource 
then is books but though when professedly 
intended for the commonest capacities they are 
found equally useless to the inquirer unless he 
be a man of more than ordinary penetration and 
comprehension 

now i take all those feilures to arise from 
want of examples without them explanations 
will avail only for the few rules may be laid 
down unexceptionably clear and still they will 
be of little general use suppose that our gram 
mars contained nothing dse the child though 
aided by a master would learn but very slowly 
indeed even the article vbvcxvta 

b 



 old and new logic 

timplest part of all is much better comprehended 
by an example and accordingly after giving 
the rule that a is used before words beginning 
with a consonant and an before wordb beginning 
with a vowel or h mute there is added as a man 
a horse a cow — an ass an eel an hour that 
little elucidation is a wonderful help to the un 
derstanding and the comprehension is only in 
proportion to such helps by some strange 
fatality our grammars are remarkably sparing in 
examples of wjio and wlwm and of the functions 
of the participle and past tense and it is for this 
reason that we so often hear those on whose 
education money has not been denied saying 
i seerty i have wenty he mmg who did you give 
it to and such like violations of concord when 
a friend corrects them and they feel ashamed 
they refer to the grammar but there seeing 
only rules which they cannot now lay themselves 
down to study they give the thing up altogether 
though a few wellexplained examples would 
enable them to guard against such errors 

yet whatever may be said of former time 
the present certainly cannot be charged with 
any churlish opposition to the spread of know 
ledge especially the last fifteen or twenty years 
literature is now so decidedly a trade and com 
petition is so active that any speculation pro 
 luisiug remuneration is eagerly embraced and 
able writers present the sciences with every 
attraction of plainness for the gratification of 
those who desire information without painful 
study yet owing to the want of that assistance 



old and new logic ll 

to which i have alladed they are seldom satis 
hedy uotwithutanding all those efforts to suit 
every degree of capacity — the grand cardinal 
defect is still unremedied there is hardly any 
thing more interesting to those persons whom i 
described in the opening of this essay than 
ancient and modem philosophy this is very 
natural when they frequently read of the 
ituman mind being kept enslaved for two thou 
sand years till bacon broke the fetters that 
aristotle had imposed on it their curiosity is 
strongly excited and no wonder by an asser 
tion so fiill of importance they seek with 
avidity every source that promises familiar infor 
mation but they find them either too obscure 
or devoid of instruction on the very points which 
they wish to have clearly explained watts 
logic though the object was as he says himself 
not to suffer the art to be engrossed by school 
men and to make it plain to al gives them 
no satisfaction it is now a hundred years before 
the public and i think i may assert that no 
one ever learned from it the difference between 
the systems of aristotle and bacon in fact it 
almost studiously keeps that out of sight inso 
much that the reader who knows nothing pre 
viously of logic is led to think that the author 
is describing a plan invented by himself though 
it is not my business to criticise his work i may 
be permitted to remark that it is strongly biassed 
towards the complicated machinery of aristotle 
and that is no recommendation as a booked 
instruction for youth but sevevx xxsfevvi 



 old and kfiw took 

appeared within the last fifteen or twenty years 
ihe sole object of which was to explain to com 
jnon understandings the difference between the 
systems of aristotle and bacon and yet not 
one of them has succeeded this i can take 
upon me to boldly assert for i have questioned 
several who read them attentively andthyhave 
after some hesitation for no one likes to bethought 
dull or stupid frankly avowed that they could 
not comprdiend wherein lay that so much vaunted 
emancipation from two thousand years oi intel 
lectual bondage now i propose to supply this 
great desideratum that is i propose to attempt 
that in which so many others in comparison to 
whom i am as an ignorant man have foiled 
if i very properly here put a note of admiration 
how much more will my masters be surprised at 
my presumption when i state the following 
pfuliculars — 

i know very little of logic because i always 
disliked it — i mean that which is taught dn col 
leges looking on it as a deception id h 
dreadful waste of valuable time how eanit do 
otherwise than dislike it my great consollitioii 
is that so few understand it and that the num 
ber of empty pedants is consequently much dimi 
nished there are perhaps youths in 
the great colleges of england scotland and 
ireland and if all of those understood the logic 
that they are there taught it would indeed be a 
great cidamity fortunately however not more 
tiian one in five hundred do understand it and 
most of them forget it entirely after leaving col 



old and new logic 

lege but there are always some who recollect 
just as much as serves to make them ridiculous 
and woe to the youth who fancies he caq wield 
that of which he has only got a glimpse for 
he then most assuredly becomes either a miserable 
sophister or an unmeaning pedant who perverts 
all his other acquirements to the most unprofitable 
purposes his constant observation is i see 
no jofiic in that while the plainest people are 
laughing at him because he is himself the weak 
est arguer imaginable when forced to yield 
or rather when overpowered by unanswerable 
objections he scorns to avow conviction and 
exclaims still i do contend that the premises 
are false because the poor creatures head is 
stuffed with syllogistic notions of major and 
minor propositions or conclusions a£brmative 
and negative which if he had marshalled well 
he is certain must have secured him a victory 
he therefore thinks that he suffered only a 
negative not a positive defeat and thus the 
vain dupe continues in darkness all his life 
unless some ray of light may haply dart on his 
clouded intellect and show him the futility and 
absurdity of his logical illusions 

since aristotles philosophy has been exploded 
by all sensible men our colleges dare not con 
demn bacon openly and yet they do it covertly 
by treating his simple structure as a thing hardly 
worth notice the truth is that they cannot 
var simplicity they wish to make every thing 
mysterious and complicated so as to appear sci 
entific and the showy system of aristotle ua 



 old and new logic 

we aim in a scientifically progretssive manner 
its object isy or ought to be the discovery of 
truth for when it deviates from that and looks 
only to victory it degenerates into sophistry 
it may also be defined as the cultivation of 
reason for though a man of an uncommonly clear 
head and luminous judgment may without any 
knowledge whatsoever of logic come to a sound 
conclusion yet still to say nothing about such 
qualifications being extremely rare some assist 
ance might be usefiil just as an exquisitely 
natural fine ear may be further improved by an 
acquaintance with the rules of music the 
utility of logic is beyond any reasonable doubt 
and the only question that can arise is whether 
it can be taught into that it would be prema 
ture to enter because one object of what follows 
is to put you in possession of the efibrts that 
have been made fir that purpose 

a common misnombb explained 

before proceeding further it is extremely 
important to explain what i venture to designate 
a misnomer and that is calling aristotle and 
bacons systems of logic philosophy with 
the learned this is no indonvenience btit i know 
that it is very embarrassing to others you 
have every one has some idea of philosophy 
and if you think that it is the exposition or 
practice of some profound speculations or 
doctrines your notion is perhaps substantially 
correct as that of the most eminent scholar 



old and new logic 

logic being the art of arradging our thoughts 
and of conducting an inveetigationy cannot be 
philosopby since it is only a general plan for 
explaining any kind of philosophy or science 
you would laugh at him who should say that a 
pack of cards was whist jbecause you know that 
it is only the means of playing that game just 
as a piano ia not music but an instrument for 
its performance aristotle may have written 
and did actually write philosophical treatises 
but tihey should not be confounded with his 
logic which was at most only a general gram 
mar for the guidance of all philosophers but 
this word philosophy which is so often abused 
has such charms with bookmen that they are 
maneuoiffily fond of it and will lug it in on 
every possible occasion now that i have ex 
plained its misuse when treating of logic you 
will be no longer puzzled to draw the distinction 
for it is really of no consequence when knovm 
but this little explanation must be very satisfac 
tory to you because the commentators on 
aristotles system will sometimes when tired of 
repeating this word philosophy a thousand 
limes call it his logics and then you think that 
they are speaking of two different things i 
may here remark just for amusement uiat the 
pluralising of logic is no proof of juiaent in 
le learned for they would smile at hearing a 
petit maitre talk of kind attentions while their 
own logics are equally ridiculous 

i shall however be particular hereafter in 
distinguishitig logic from philosowakx 



 old and new logic 

is extremely necessary for oar immediate 
pmpose it was the logic of aristotle that kept 
the human acuities so long enslaved and it 
was the better logic of bacon that achieved 
tiieir liberty the philosophy of aristotle did 
certainly great injury because it was replete 
with grave errors but then according as those 
errors were discovered the injury was lessening 
whereas his logic being a vicious stem of 
general reasoning or argument affords no 
prospect of relief except in the rejection of it 
altogether 

on the origin of logic 

man acquainted with writing cannot be long 
advanced in study or science without thinking 
of logic it is the natural result of a tolerable 
progress in civilisation to say nothing of the 
vulgar multitude the many blunders of the 
educated and the erroneous conclusions to 
which they arrive in argument would suggest 
the necessity of some fixed plan a love of 
order is the first fiuits of a departure from the 
savage state and this goes on gradually till it at 
last extends to the regulation of our very 
thoughts it is probable that rhetoric which 
means forcible speaking gives the first hint of 
logic when one orator invariably leaves adeeper 
impression than others and when it is found 
that this superiority does not altogether consist 
in his words or gestures however elegant or 
appropriate nor yet in strength of argument it 



old and new logic 

i discovered that his power is attributable to a 
better anangement of his topics and a more 
connected detail by which he rivets the attention 
of his hearers and influences them to the end of 
his discourse this i say might lead to logic 
but as that is only a surmise of my own it 
matters little whether the inference be erroneous 
or true 

rise and prooress of aristotles logic 

and philosophy 

as we know but little of ancient egypt 
where science first dawned we may as well 
turn at once to greece it is there that we 
have the first record of logic she had her 
poets historians philosophers science scholars 
painters sculptors architects musicians and a 
refined theatre when the rest of the world was 
in a rude state accordingly we find that at a 
very early period several of her learned men 
put forth different systems of logic but they all 
soon fell into the shade when aristotles 
appeared he was a philosopher of a matchless 
grasp of mind and capacious intellect gifted 
with a rare sagacity and a wonderful knowledge 
of the human heart he penetrated as it were 
into futurity and he furnished a system so 
artfiilly contrived that its mere developement is 
an exercise of skill to use it as an art in itself 
each expounder plumes himself on the supe 
riority of his illustrations and what could be 
more gratifying to the pride tke wv ca 



 old and new logic 

weakness of man than a system which left victory 
either undecided or disputable aristotle knew 
this well when he gave his fatal present to pos 
terity it was worse than the fobled box of 
pandora for that contained hope but our 
philosophers pernicious gift provided no allevi 
ation for its immeasurable evils he wrote his 
evermemorable work probably in b c 
so that it is now about years old and yet 
its influence despite of bacons acknowledged 
refutation is still very considerable 

aristotles success was equal to his mighty 
genius his philosophy taken in the roost 
comprensive meaning spread through greece 
even before his death notwithstanding the oppo 
sition of many eminent rivals who felt themselves 
humiliated at being nnceremonionsly thrown 
aside it was adopted by the romans who 
indeed hardly excelled in any thing bat the art 
of war and gigantic stmctures though they 
borrowed the principles of architecture from 
greece after their colossal empire was dis 
solved it began to influence the christians who 
had previously been rather inclined towards 
plato whose system of reasoning was of a mor 
amiable and persuasive character in the sixth 
century it appears to have lost ground but in 
the next its operation is described as something 
like enchantment the entire learned world 
was occupied in commentaries glosses and dis 
sertations on it which served however to 
render it only the more dark and unintelligible i 
translations of it were made into arabic and 



old and new logic 

latin— it was revered alike by christians jews 
mahometans qr other sects and it spread like a 
pi ague as it proved to be not only through 
europe but also into such parts of asia and 
africa where there were any meti who pretended 
to learning in sbroe instances kings icom 
manded that tto other system should be read or 
taught and tb show its extraordinary ascen 
dency the power even of a pope was unavailing 
as was proved by innocent iii having 
through the solemn council of lateran prohibited 
the use of aristotles physics and metaphysics 
which are properly speaking his philosopfay it 
was soon found niecessary to rescind the order 
this will appear astonishing when we consider 
that the popes mandate then in matters of 
apparently less consequence shook the greatest 
potentates on their thrones but the truth is 
that like swifts big and little endians in lilliput 
where eleven thousand persons cheerfully suf 
fered death sooner than break their eggs at the 
smaller end men were so bewitched by this 
philosophers writings that they would deem it 
nothing less than martyrdom to die in its defence 
their cry was for aristotle entire as john bull 
clamors for the whole constitution and nothing 
but the constitution though it is well for him that 
some inconvenient parts of it have been altered 
at length aftr blood had been actually shed 
in disputing about aristotle the many important 
discoveries by a friar roger bacon together 
willi those of the itaariuers compass and america 
proved boixif of the t pvioscjikftt ogcc

to be false and even his most ardent admirers 
were forced to admit that he was not always 
infallible the invention of printing having by 
the cheapness of books made reading accessible 
to thousands who were before debarred from it 
there was a great increase of that portion of 
society deemed learned and of course a new 
augmentation to diversity of opinions in half 
a century after printing copernicus a catholic 
priest demonstrated the true theory of the earth 
and planetary system and tlus helped much to 
shake the supremacy of aristotle as it proved 
incontestably that he was wrong in several of 
his assertions and often presumptuous in his 
inferences luther the great champion of the 
reformation who had been at one time his 
supporter now attacked him violently and 
chiefly because he was pretty generally favoured 
by the catholic clergy which was almost 
enough to determine his opposition many 
eminent catholics though opposed to protestant 
ism joined in the aristotelian war and it now 
seemed easy to pull the great ruler from that 
throne which he had occupied for almost twenty 
centuries 

but who was to perform the daring feat 
the throne could not be left vacant and the 
difficulty was to find a substitute for the mighty 
despot there must be philosophy and 
without some plan of reasoning there can be 
none but when those doughty assailants began 
to cool a little and to look around them they 
found that they were only a mob who rail 



old and new logic 

against a bad governmenty though unable to 
devise a better aristotles philosophy had 
been successfully attacked because a good part 
of it was proved to be erroneous but though 
many exposed no one yet was able to remedy 
the defects in his system of logic here we 
shall leave it for a moment in order to note a 
few things that may be satisfactory to you 
hereafter 

aristotle whose greek name is aristoteles 
is sometimes called the stagirite because he 
was bom at stagira on the borders of macedonia 
and the place was deemed honored if not sacred 
by his birth which was in b c after 
being many years under plato he set up a 
school of his own at athens with gieat success 
his followers were called peripatetics from a 
greek word signifying to walk about because 
he lectured and instructed his pupils as they 
moved to and fro in the lycaeum his great 
work on logic is called the organon or organum 
which signifies a machine or instrument it 
consists of fifteen distinct books or treatises — 
one on categories one on interpretation two 
on first analytics two on last aiialytics eight 
on topics and one on sophisms some are 
supposed to be lost but those mentioned now 
constitute his organon or logic and there 
is usually prefixed to them an introduction by 
porphyry a platonic philosopher and a noted 
enemy of the christians who died a d 
aristotle opened his school in b c being 
then years old but he had itvnfc y 



 old and new logic 

long before gillies says that be died in 
at but if be were bora in that would 
make bim out only on tbose points tbe 
accounts do not agree exactly 

it is necessary that i make some remarks on 
tbe word organon as it will bereafter occur very 
often for your greater convenience i always 
spell it as in tbe greek witb tbe termination on 
tbougb wben latinised and preceded by tbe 
word novum new it requires um very 
eminent classical scholars do however fre 
quently write novum organon whether through 
inadvertence or choice know not and i have 
determined to use no other orthography except 
in quotations 

short notice op bacns logic 

the man who wast destined to dethrone 
aristotle at length appeared this was francis 
bacon lord verulam and viscount st albans 
but most commonly called lord bacon he 
was bora in london january nd and 
died at highgate near that city april th 
at the age of and was buried at st albans 

bacons great logical work was called 
novum organum scientiarum or a new 
method of studying the sciences in that he 
demonstrates that induction is the natural and 
the only rational mode of analysis or investiga 
tion this was the talisman that opened the 
door of aristotles mystic tabernacle and 
discovered that its wonderful effects arose as all 



old and new logic 

attempts at human mysteries must from some 
thing like a ehowbox contrivance which by 
pullingc a string exhibits many pleasing delusions 
when viewed through a glass ouiside 

this great work first printed in was 
preceded by another on the advancement of the 
sciences or learning which bur author deemed 
necessary in order to prepare the public mind 
for his organon it ought to have been called 
the deficiencies of science for its chief object is 
to enumerate the defects and omissions in the 
various attempts of former writers and inquirers 
some of those chains have been since supplied 
from the hints of bacon and it was certainly a 
most valuable present to science and the literary 
world 

why his organon or logic has not made so 
rapid a progress as it ought after being published 
almost two centuries and a quaiter will be 
noticed in the proper place 

bacon is at once the glory and disgrace of 
england enlightened to a degree that rarely 
falls to the lot of man he was stained with some 
of the most revolting vices his conduct 
towards his generous friend and benefactor the 
unfortunate essex is an instance almost un 
paralleled in our annals of the blackest 
ingratitude — that crime for which nations 
provide no punishment and which religion only 
can check his taking of bribes from suitors 
while he sat as chancellor and which he was 
obliged to admit when found guilty is a 
sickening instance of depravity in the highest 



 old and new logic 

judge in a civilised country and his general 
meanness to obtain bis ends and bis fulsome 
adulation of tbe great are absolutely disgusting 
those who wish for a specimen have only to 
read in the second paragraph of his advance 
ment of tbe sciences addressed to james i 
that part beginning with for i am assured 
and ending at miracle or down to hermes 
or philosopher which is a tissue of the vilest 
sycophancy and isebood but the whole 
paragraph is indeed a model for the sorriest 
poetaster when inscribing bis wretched doggerel 
to some person of rank and this sample of 
reckless mendacity from him who opened the 
road to truth 

infinitely worse characters than bacon are 
every where found but our indignation is 
particularly raised against him who could 
practise vice while he was illuminating the way 
to right reasoning the parliament did their 
duty in condemning him and perhaps james 
is excusable for remitting the sentence if one 
who invented a telescope by which men and 
animals could be distinctly seen in the moon 
were to commit a serious crime would not all 
nations petition to spare him who had made 
such a valuable contribution to science and 
yet bacons organon is of much more import 
ance to the world 

the frailties of this highly gifted man have 
nevertheless their use they serve to lower 
our pride to show us the value of that humility 
so energetically recommended by christ and to

correct a belief that had before very generally 
prevailed that it was impossible for a master 
mind and surpassing intellect to be superlatively 
mean selfish and dishonest 

sketch of aristotles logic 

the basis of this system is the syllogism 
this is a form of couching the substance of 
your argument or investigation into one short 
line or sentence — then corroborating or support 
ing it in another and drawing your conclusion 
or proof in a third thus suppose that you 
wound yourself up to such enthusiasm about 
virtue as to think that in order to enforce it all 
sins as being transgressions of virtue should be 
punished by death you would condense the 
narrow of your doctrine into some such shape 
as this — 

 every sin deserves death 

 every unlawful wish is a sin 

 therefore every unlawful wish deserves 
death 

these are usually named the major minor 
and conclusion but diere are great differences 
ttnth respect to the two first lines sometimes the 
first is called the premises and sometimes the 
first premiss and tiie next the second premiss 
the first is sometimes called the proposition or 
subject or affirmative and the next the predicate 
and sometimes the middle term but in analysing 
a syllogism there is a middle term and a 
predicate too in each of the lines often the 
minor is first and the major next but tvgw 



 old and new logic 

some of those distinctions are mere varieties of 
name just as we say house or mansion indiffer 
ently others are of essential consequence for 
according as the syllogism is constructed the 
minor may be actually first and the major next 
and so of other differences i merely make 
those remarks because i know that you are 
puzzled when you read any account about 
syllogisms and you often think the printer has 
made some mistake or transposed the names of 
the different lines 

afer having composed your syllogism you 
proceed to explain and enforce its truth in 
detail but as you go on a necessity fof new 
syllogisms will arise for every new point 
or assertion must have that form at least implied 
— that is it must be reducible into that shape 
though you need not parade it in separate lines 
like blank verse in this way you arrive step 
by step at the end of your investigation or 
inquiry but if you have an adversary to cotn 
bat the labor is considerably increased for 
he may deny your premises which means that 
he denies the justice or legitimacy of your 
syllogistic affirmations and as there are regular 
rules for the construction of all kinds of syllo 
gisms you must rectify yours if his objections 
be wellfounded or otherwise you will be 
deemed to have been defeated and the victory 
will be awarded to him but if you be both 
equally expert tacticians in this logic you may 
go on till each is tired and then the contest 
ends like a drawn battle 



old and n£w logic 

po one who has not studied this system 
bay e nothing appears sd absurd as an argument 
aaatbe syllogism you see two dogmatical 
assertions which nobody is bound to believe 
d then a conclusioa • drawn with all the 
arrogance of one who seems to think that his 
word is a law not tobe questioned it appears 
iiowevr to be very simple and easy but take 
care j it is anything but simple aristotles 
plan iiad three figures or kinds of syllogisms to 
which the celebrated galen in about five hun 
dred years after ided a fourth to supply as 
iie said ian omission of the gieat founder 
each figure has modesf or forms of con 
struction making in all it is true that 
 our modem logicians generally reject galens 
figure and seldom use more than about of 
each of the three others but even that would 
make and to master which completely 
•would i assure you require more study than 
you could well believe i forbear entering into 
tny review ef these because that is not my 
proince and besides you must recollect that 
my bargain with you is of quite a different 
nature another reason is that while it would 
tequire a volume in itself it would be incom 
prehensible unless you laid yourself down to a 
most serious and irksome study i shall only 
botice two piincipal distinctions in syllogisms — 
at they are either affirmative or negative of 
the first you have already an example— the 
xjihet is used to deny or refute something that 
you think is untenable and it mx vnb 
word notf as thus — 



 old and new logic 

 every thing virtuous is praise worthy 

 some pleasures are not praise worthy 

 therefore some pleasures are not virtuous 
or thus — 

 whatever is not praise worthy is not vir 
tuous 

 some pleasures are not praiseworthy 

 therefore some pleasures are not virtuous 
but a kind of negative syllogism may be so 

constructed as to dispense with noty as in this 
example— 

 no work of god is bad 

 the natural passions and appetites of men 
are the work of god 

 therefore none of them is bad 

this is for our purpose enough on ordinary 
syllogisms which you perceive have only three 
sentences or propositions and it is indeed gene 
rally taken that if they require more they are 
vitiated but aristotle who did not like to do 
things by halves foreseeing that cases would 
occur requiring more has obligingly furnished 
other kinds of syllogisms where half a dozen 
sentences may be used and they are generally 
classed under the head of compound syllogisms 
of these the most remarkable are the prosyllo 
gism and sorites and i give a description and 
example of each fixm dr watts — 

 a prosyllogism is when two or more syllo 
gisms are so connected together that the con 
clusion of the former is the major or minor of 
the following as blood cannot think but the 
soul of man thinks therefore the soul of man 



old and new logic 

is not blood but the soul of a brut e is his 
blood accordinlrta gciluturii lliyi tte 
soul f tim is diiferenc from the soul of a 
brute 

nothing saves this example from being down 
right tomfoolery but according to scripture 
because we admit it to be of divine authority 
even with that help it appears to be a very 
meager kind of argument to prove the immor 
tality of the soul for that is evidently its drift 
the doctrine of plato though a pagan is more 
convincing and we need not wonder that young 
men who learn logic by such illustrations are 
much worse reasoners than if they had never 
known any thing of it whatsoever 

 a sorites is when several middle terms are 
chosen to connect one another successively in 
several propositions till the last proposition 
connects its predicate with the first subject 
thus all men of revenge have their souls often 
uneasy uneasy souls are a plague to them 
selves now to be ones own plague is folly in 
the extreme therefore all men of revenge are 
extreme fools 

you have now i should think a notion of 
the part that the syllogism plays in argument 
for i do not look to or expect more with this 
aristotle took extraordinary pains and he dis 
tinctly claims the invention that is as to theory 
and doctrine and a regular system for its 
application or use the syllogism was always 
known as i shall show in another place but he 
was the first who anatomised it av nvo a 



 old and n£w logic 

it the principal material of the most gorgeous 
structure of logic that wfis ever erected yet 
the syllogism was the subject of his analytics 
only and if you look back to the list you will 
find two works before them on catpries 
and on interpretation concerning vhicby 
and the other books in rotation we shal say a 
few words 

categories 

though i thought it right to begin with the 
syllogism as being the actual foundation and 
main support of aristotles logic he or perhaps 
whoever arranged bis organon commences 
with the categories as a preliminary step in the 
art of reasoning their object is to divide or 
class under ten heads whatsoever can come 
within human apprehension anything like an 
intelligible elanation would require a great 
deal of writing and i shall only say that like 
chemistry they reduce what is whole into its 
component parts you may however have 
some idea of their use from this description— 
 as every soldier belongs to some company 
and every company to some regiment in like 
manner every thing that can be the object of 
human thought has its place in one or other of 
the ten categories and by dividing and sub 
dividing properly tbe several categories all the 
notions that enter into the human mind may be 
mustered in rank and file like an army in the 
day of battle 



old and new logic 

these categories are at once tiie admiration 
and the torment of logicians they must ever 
be admired as a prodigious effort of genius but 
they are exceedingly difficult of management 
several attempts have been made to render them 
more tractable but without much success 
locke reduced them to three but in doing 
that he left the whole thing defective nor have 
the more recent attempts at general divisions 
been much more successful every one admits 
that a regular distribution of things under proper 
classes or heads is a great help both to memory 
and judgment but aristotles project was too 
vast to be embraced by man — the human 
powers are unequal to so bold a flight into the 
regions of methodical delineatidn 

now whether you understand all this or not 
is of little consequence at present you can at 
least perceive by it that aristotles genius was 
of immense extent and it is my duty to impress 
that on your mind we rarely leave one 
extreme without going into another those 
who fancy tbat they have caught the spirit of 
bacons logimink that unless by decrying the 
abilities of his grat predecessor they can never 
sufficiently show their sincerity and conviction 
but that only betrays tiieir ignorance and i wish 
to put yott on your guard against such an ex 
posure 

interpretation or definition 

the work on interpretation is a necessary 
preparation for the study of any logical vexiv 



 old and new logic 

and i venture to say that it ought to be placed 
first it gives instructions for the proper under 
standing of every thing that enters into the 
composition of speech and that is of great 
importance to right reasoning hence it is 
unavoidably a kind of philosophical grammar 
and it actually begins by examining what is a 
noun or a verb— an affirmative or negation and 
even speech itself it embraces a variety of 
views and definitions all tending to the correct 
use of words and at length proceeds to pro 
positions future contingencies and various dis 
sertations that make up as it were the science 
of language the writers on logic borrow largely 
fiom this work when treating of judgment and 
propositions 

topics 

after the analytics come the topics 
of this work it is very difficult to explain the 
natme to a nonlogician because the design 
appears to be a further extension development 
or dissection of the categories which you have 
already seen are not easily comprehended 
aristotles method here is not generally ap 
proved of but though the logicians do not 
follow it they draw their topics or heads of 
argument fiom this work which is a rich 
storehouse of all possible distinctions all that 
can be said on one side or other of every ques 
tion is collected as it were into one grand 
inexhaustible arsenal fiom which all future 
combatants might be furnished with arms offen 



k 



old and new logic 

sive and defensive in every cause so as tcf leave 
no room to future generations to invent any 
thing new what a creative genius does 
aristotle constantly exhibit need we wonder 
that his bitterest opponents are forced to admire 
his wonderful ingenuity 

the topics conclude with a code of laws for 
managing syllogistic disputations on the part of 
both assailant and defendant — from which it is 
evident that aristotle trained his disciples to 
contend not merely for truth but for victory 

sophisms 

we are now arrived at the sophisms — 
the last part of this famous organon or logical 
machine this is what has thrown the greatest 
shade on aristotles honesty of intention and 
which has tended most to shake his stately 
fabric not content with a labyrinth of simple 
syllogisms sufficiently perplexing to both parties 
— not content with adding to this a maze of 
complex conjunctive disjunctive relative con 
nective categorical and compound syllogisms — 
not content with laying down an insidious code 
for the management of those syllogisms by 
which the disputants might like two equally 
skilful fencers tilt at one another with impunity 
— not content i say with all those allurements 
he gives his sophisms as the last or finishing 
step to deception it is possible though barely 
possible that he might have conceived a syllo 
gistic scrutiny to be a good means of detecting 



 old and new logic 

eitor but it is very hard indeed to believe tbat a 
roan of his penetrating intellect could write his 
sophisms with a view to aid in the discovery of 
tnith they are truly a masterpiece of im 
posing ingenuity he introduces them as 
fallacies which of course every honest reasoner 
would be glad to detect but in the end they 
jmove to be weapons for both attack and defence 
and by which truth may be rendered unavailing 
it is from this that we have our word sophistry 
which is explained in the dictionaries fallacious 
reasoning — a very remarkable meaning when 
owe consider that the inventor proffered it as a 
protection against fallacy 

the friends of aristotle and they are still 
very numerous have strained hard to defend his 
sophisms but they appear to have a bad cause 
in handg for if they maintain his honesty of 
intention it is at the expense of his abilities 
which they will not allow to be called in ques 
tion one who is anxiously impartial says 
 it was probably aristotles aim to reduce all 
the possible variety of sophisms as he had 
attempted to do of just syllogisms to certain 
definite species but he seems to be sensible 
that he had fallen short in this last attempt 
now it is not easy to discover where he seems 
sensible of any failure for after having 
with his usual confidence enumerated the various 
kinds of sophisms he goes on with new instruc 
tions in the art of managing syllogistic disputes 
and his peroration or conclusion is a specimen 
of anything but diffidence 



old and new logic 

but it is nevertheless possible that the 
analysis of such a prodigious ramification of 
syllogistic contingencies and all the consequent 
justifications might have been too much for 
even the gigantic powers of an aristotle — why 
then should he as a man of integrity promul 
gate a system which was manifestly pernicious 
by its imperfection i fear that we must agree 
with a commentator who says but how is it 
possible that a man of his capacity could long 
remain ignorant how insufficient a syllogism is 
for discovering any latent truth he certainly 
intended his system of logics chiefly if not 
solely for disputation and if such was his 
purpose he has been wonderfully successfiil 
for nothing can be better contrived than that 
iystem for wrangling and disputing without 
€nd he indeed in a manner professes this to 
be his aim in his work de sophisticis elenchis 
observe well that this vtork is his book on 
sophisms 

you will now be surprised to learn while 
reading of the human mind being kept in 
fetters by aristotle for years that the 
real value of his sophisms was known even in his 
lifetime as will appear by the following anecdote 
of alexander the great who was educated by 
him and for whom he always had the highest 
respect and the warmest affection some per 
sons having travelled from macedon all the way 
to persia with complaints against antipater 
alexander observed that they would not have 
made so long a journey had the tcevx v 

c 



 old and new togic 

injur cassander son of antipater replying 
that their long journey was an argument against 
them as tinisting that witnesses would not be 
brought from such a distance to give evidence 
of their calumny alexander smiling said 
 your argument is one of aristotles sophisms 
which will serve either side equally well 
this shows that he at least was not gulled 
tiiou instructed from the very lips of the great 
logician himself but the enlightened are 
always few when error is popular 

why do t dwell so much on these sophisms 
it is because they cannot be displaced witliout 
ruining the whole system though they show how 
its chief support the syllogism might be effec 
tively vitiated here aristotle like some over 
eager titneses on a trial proved too much 
though his followers were not bright enough to 
perceive the blunder vauban after demon 
strating how the strongest places could be taken 
regretted that he had done so much for their 
attack and thought to counteract the effect by 
showing how they could be rendered impregna 
ble but he found that he bad foiled himself 
already by the efficiency of his plans for siege 
anstotle after constructing with immense labor 
a huge fortress of syllogisms taught how to 
demolish it or in other words to undermine his 
own entire system of logic but as this is a 
matter of great importance we must examine it 
plainly and lay aside all figurative language 

the aristotelians say that tiie sophisms serve 
only to prove the weakness or defective con 



old and new logic s 

struction of a syllogism if we grant that we 
must yield because nothing surely is more 
reasonable than to have means of meeting a 
canning or dishonest opponent and of preventing 
him from baffling truth by an artful and de 
ceiptiously contrived syllogism but we cannot 
admit such an explanation because the sophisms 
while they detect either designed or accidental 
misconstruction furnish the defender of false 
hood with new and endless yes endless 
resources for opposing truth and show the folly 
of attempting to reason under a system mainly 
supported by such a flexible thing as the 
syllogism 

it were well for aristotles fame if he had 
locked his sophisms up in his own breast for 
though they kept the learned world long con 
tending they ultimately overthrew his system 
by proving the poverty of its fabrication he 
did not calculate badly however on the weak 
ness of mankind and the slow progress of 
reason and judgment as the duration of his 
power shows but had he stopped at the 
topics and heaven knows there would then 
have been quite enough about syllogisms his 
reign might probably have been further extended 
the inefficiency of the syllogism might be seen 
as indeed it actually was before bacon but the 
sophisms exposed its insidious nature and men 
the more gladly embraced the new logic which 
delivered them from a system of unmanly 
stratagem in direct hostility to all notions of 
equity

aristotelian mania fairly described 



this glance at the books comprising the 
whole of aristotles organon or logic though 
not exactly belonging to an ordinary view will 
nevertheless forward our main object and i 
doubt not that it has afforded you some assist 
ance i shall now make some remarks on that 
aristotelian mania which is represented by our 
writers in such astounding terms doubtless 
you think as i once thought that nations were 
all convulsed and as in a state of warfiare in 
contending about aristotle but they were no 
such thing for they remained as quiet as at 
present those temble contests of which 
we have heard so much were confined to the 
learned and the people took little or no part in 
them for this very plain reason that they did 
not understand what the combatants were about 
besides you must keep in mind this important 
fact that the learned were then very limited 
for reading now so common was deemed a 
high accomplishment previous to printing and 
consequently the numbers engaged in those 
strifes must have been small but they appear 
formidable when aided by glowing language 
just as homers catalogue of the ships makes 
the grecian forces seem innumerable because 
he takes care not to mention the amount 
even now when almost every peasant can 
read there are important questions agitating the 
scientific world of which very few have heard 
as for instance the parallax of the fixed stars 



old and new logic 

you might go into every genteel company and 
not find one present who knows any thing at all 
of the matter or yet what parallax means 

but we must admit that what the learned are 
doing is of great consequence to nations they 
are the instructors of the people and whatever 
errors they make are disseminated throughout 
no one ever heard of a country where the lower 
orders were better informed than the higher 
you must not think however that the general 
state of enlightenment is in proportion to that of 
the upper ranks for any gross error promulgated 
amongst the people is unfortunately very hard 
to eradicate afterwards and it remains firmly 
engrafted on them long after being exploded by 
men of discernment and education i need now 
only instance witchcraft ghosts and fortune 
telling because i shall have occasion to touch 
on the subject again 

furilier exposiiion of the syllogism 

it is right in justice to the world that you 
should know that there was always great oppo 
sition to aristotle and that he did not impose 
quite so extensively as our flaming accounts 
might lead you to think there were always 
thank god some sensible men in the world 
who saw through the cheats of mystery though 
they sometimes wanted either ability or influence 
to stem the torrent of blind credulity in all 
ages since aristotle wrote he has been ridi 
culed lampooned satirised or more qtvovsia 



 old and new logic 

attacked which shows at least that there were 
never wanting men who saw the real tendency 
of his system and who would not debase their 
understanding by worshipping his phantom of 
logic i may mention lucian a witty giebian 
author who died ad in a humorous 
account of a supposed sale of slaves or old 
philosophers he introduces chrysippus a fol 
lower of aristotle to be sold and mercury acts 
as auctioneer chrysippus after the buyer has 
asked him many questions which we shall pass 
says 

you deride me good sir but take care that 
i do not shoot you with an indefinite syllogism 

buyer and what evil is to be feared from 
that weapon 

chrys doubt and silence and distraction of 
mind but what is greatest i can if i wisb 
instantly make you a stone 

buyer how a stone 

cjirys thus is a stone a body 

buyer yes 

chrys why then is not an animal a body 

buyer yes 

chrys are you an animal 

buyer i think so 

chrys ergo you are a stone being a body 

buyer not at all but liberate me i pray 
you and make me a man again 

chrys it is not difficult — be then a man once 
more tell me is every body an animal 

buyer no 

chrys what is a stone an animal 



old and new logic 

buyer no 

chrys but are you a body 

buyer yes 
 chrys being a body then are u an animal 

buyer yes 

chrys therefore you are not a stone being 
an animal 

buyer you have done well since already my 
legs like those of niobe were chilled and 
stony but i will however buy you 

it is curious to observe that lucian here 

seems to give the merit of the syllogism to 

chrysippus though he lived a century after 

aristotle who claims the invention mercury 

next calls the great peripatetic himself and then 

puffs him off as being the wisest philosopher in 

the universe who knows amongst many other 

wonderful things how long a gnat lives to 

what depth the sea is rendered pellucid by the 

sun what sort is the soul of oysters that man is 

a risible animal but that an ass is not nor fit 

for building or sailing in consequence of so 

many valuable qualifications he is knocked 

down at a higher price than chrysippus brought 

yet lucian is particularly severe upon him for 

he ridicules through chrysippus his syllogistic 

logic and derides his philosophy by a ludicrous 

exhibition of himself but though the raillery 

is certainly overstrained it shows the unfitness 

of the syllogism for discovering truth indeed 

it exposes its pliancy and its accommodating 

miture so plainly that i think you will derive 

some information by seeing the thing in regular 

syllogistic form — 



i 

 



 old and new logic 

 every body is an animal 

 every man is a body 

 therefore every man is an animal 
here man is proved to be an animal and then 
our syllogist goes on — 

 every stone is a body 

 every man is a body 

 therefore every man is a stone 

man id now proved to be a stone but having 
before proved that he is an animal he can be 
easily restored to animation thus — 

 a stone is not an animal 

 man is an animal 

 therefore man is not a stone 

the great locke in his human understand 
ing b ch sec approves of lucianh 
satire yet our peripatetics will scout it as a 
broad caricature of the syllogism but if they 
lay aside their prejudices they will find that it is 
not a very gross perversion we admit that 
the syllogism is useful and that it is necessary 
in its proper place and they ought to concede 
that a theory mainly depending on it for 
support is better calculated for disputation than 
for the detection of error or the veiification of 
any asserted truth 

lucian again takes occasion to attack the 
syllogism in his philosophers revived where 
be represents them in a great iage and bringing 
liimself to trial for having sold them as slaves 
but there were hundreds of much abler op 
ponents who literally shook both the logic anl 
philosophy of aristotle to pieces and that too 



old and new lic 

at the risk of suffering for some of them were 
severely punished by their respective sovereigns 
for daring to question his infallibility do not 
be surprised however that they all failed in 
overthrowing him i told you before that there 
must be some kind of logic and as none of 
them offered a better substitute for aristotles 
it was in vain that they exposed its weakness 
and futility were it possible for a man to 
demonstrate and that so clearly as to convince 
every one that our present system of astronomy 
was erroneous we would still stick to it unless 
be furnished a more rational one in its stead 
a score or two of learned men have attacked 
newtons attraction and repulsion but none of 
them have devised a superior scheme and so they 
all lie unheeded we are not gienerally satisfied 
with our theory of the tides but the moon will 
retain her influence till some better agent for the 
ebb and flow of the sea shall be discovered so it 
was with aristotles logic long and long ago 
was its ineptitude exposed but no one could 
undertake to fill its place the glory of that 
achievement was reserved for lord bacon 

you are by this time i flatter myself 
beginning to comprehend the years of 
mental slavery and also to understand some 
thing about the unfitness of aristotles logic for 
unravelling error or discovering truth before 
you can however have that clear conception 
at which i aim there are some other explana 
tions necessary concerning his system but these 
i reserve because they will come in the xwck

insitriictively when treating of his great and 
successful opponent 

sketch of bacons logic 

this is much more easily explained and com 
prehended than the old system its basis is 
induction which is thus described in the library 
of useful knowledge no in an article 
specially devoted to a familiar exemplifi 
cation of the baconian logic — 

 the grand principle which characterizes this 
great work bacons organon and by the 
proper use of which its author proposes the 
advancement of all kinds of knowledge is the 
principle of induction which means literally a 
bringing in for the plan it unfolds is that d 
investigating nature and enquiiing after truth 
not by reasoning upon mere conjectures about 
natures laws and properties as philosophers had 
been too much accustomed to do before but 
by bringing together y carefully and patiently a 
variety of particular facts and instances view 
ing these in all possible lights and drawing 
from a comparison of the whole some general 
principle or truth that applies to all 

from this which you would do well to get 
off by heart you will already perceive that there 
is a great difference between the new and old 
logic the first is the logic of nature while 
the other is that of artifice — it is the logic of 
truth while the other is that of stratagem and 
dexterity it disclaims all skill except what 



old and new logic 

legitimately belongs to tle art of reasoning 
while the other does not scruple to pot an ftppola 
nent down by cunning or legerdemain vve 
may indeed emphatically say that one is really 
the art of reasoning and the other that of ignoble 
disputation 

induction teaches that when you set about 
any discussion investigation inquiry or argument 
you must collect all the information that you can 
on the subject and in doing this you must 
spare neither time nor trouble you must then 
examine each fact deliberately compare one 
with another and observe the agreements or 
disagreements then you must review them 
all in relation to how they respectively support 
each othr reject those that do not appear to be 
sufficiently authenticated or which present man 
fest contradictions and having thu laid as it 
were a foundation of general materials for your 
argument you proceed to a more particular 
investigation and at length draw from the whole 
strengthened by your own observations and 
reasoning the conclusion which is your object 
to demonstrate some say that you proceed 
from particulars to generals but that does not 
seem so plain to ordinary understandings you 
certainly come at last to a general conclusion 
and though my explanation may be objection 
able it cannot i think lead you astray 

the process is the same on abstract matters 
or such as offer no facts or instances such as —

the last sigh or remains for a short time aftec 



 old and new logic 

that in the new or baconian system you begin 
at the bottom and work upwards to the top 
whereas in the old or aristotelian they began 
at the top and worked downwards to the bottom 
i think you ought now to comprehend what that 
means formerly they disdained as it were 
common labor in any exertion of the mental 
faculties and therefore in a disquisition or 
argument they began by discussing the most 
intricate parts of the subject and frequently 
wandered into topics that had nothing to do with 
it at all which brought them into frivolous dis 
putes about words and nice distinetions of no 
consequence whatsoever in this way and in 
arranging their syllogisms they lost so much 
time that they hardly ever dived into their subject 
 — insomuch that one might say that they began 
and finished their inquiry at the top and did 
not work downwards hence their conclusions 
were commonly arrogant or iilfbunded 

directly contrary is the new system after 
a pioper preparation which shall be hereafter 
explained you begin by the patient and labo 
rious method of induction to clear your way to 
the top where you arrive step by step and thus 
gradually complete your inquiry does not this 
appear to be the more natural plan and is not 
there a strong probability that your conclusion 
will be the more rational 

in the old system they set out with presump 
tion and cockcrowing for their object was 
victor — in the new modesty is or ought to be 
the leading feature otheiwise induction is dis 



old axd new logic 

torted because its object is the discovery of truth 
and it inculcates that you should rather be 
defeated than victorious when defeat convinces 
you of having been in error 

the old system allows of stratagems and 
hitches without end — the new permits no advan 
tages to be taken over an adversary when it is 
plain that he erred merely through inadvertence 

 prevailing error 

i have before remarked that we seldom leave 
one extreme without running into another 
jsome persons and they are more numerous 
than could be wished hearing aristotle cried 
down and being relieved from his cumbrous 
theory of syllogisms and impressed with the 
simple nature of induction think that they are 
emancipated from all the trammels of logical 
rules and that they are now free to conduct an 
argument as they please this is a great 
mistake and it has produced too many pre 
tended logicians every art must have its rules 
and as reasoning is an art we cannot dispense 
with certain precepts those laid down by 
aristotle can never be wholly thriivn aside and 
though his syllogistic system is justly replaced 
by a better it does not follow that he should be 
entirely rejected he traced the rudiments of 
logic with such a comprehensive hand that 
however they may be modified or improved 
they will always furnish materials for the 
constiuction of any other system bacon 



 old and new logic 

himself leaves a great part of his tem 
undisturbed — insomuch that the novum or 
ganon is but a review of its main defects with 
the remedies proposed for their rectification 

llemarks on the elements of logic 

every study miist begin with the humbler or 
rudimental parts in music we commence with 
the simple notes — in grammar with the parts of 
speech or in reading with the alphabet and eo 
logic has likewise its progressive steps what 
seems first necessary is definition this teacher 
that you aflsx a settled meaning to your words 
and so use them consistently throughout your 
discourse or investigation but this applies 
only to such words as are of obvious importance 
in your inquiry and not to those that cannot 
possibly be misunderstood or mistaken sup 
pose that you were writing or speaking on ao 
ordinary subject as the impolicy and miseries of 
war you might use the words perception y con 
caption and apprehension indiscriminately 
lecause they would not affect the drift of your 
inquiry but if on a metaphysical dissertation 
on our mentauculties those words become of 
great consequence and you must then be precise 
in your choice and meaning ordinarily you 
may say the perception the conception or the 
apprehension of such a thing but now you can 
give no latitude or scope to the sense that you 
intend to convey perception may be the 
consciousness of an object when present and 



old am new logic 

conception the forming an idea of tbe object 
wiietber present or absent while apprehension 
may be found too loose and vague for any 
specific application here then you must 
define clearly what you mean by the word you 
adopt whether it be perception or conception 
and stick to that given meaning invaiiahly 
throughout or if yon have occasion lor both 
you must assign them their separate and 
respective functions your oonent has a 
right to call upon you for an exact definition of 
any leading word that you use but when you 
give that satisfactorily as regards your own 
meaning he is not now allowed to question that 
fiirther though it may be quite at variance with 
his own notions this is a striking feature in 
the new logic and which it may be ceptable 
to explain more particularly 

formerly they were so fascinated wilii hair 
splitting and nice dissections that every 
discussion was almost sure to involve a gram 
matical contest and the parties appeared more 
like pedagogues squabbling about trifling lis 
tinctions dian scientific men seriously engaged 
in coming at truth it mattered not how 
clearly one explained certain words or terms 
— the other might dispute the propriety of 
his definitions and thus in such silly alterclatioos 
they wasted a greiat deal of time wandered 
away fitmi the main object of inquiry and nd 
imfiquently lost sight of it altogether they 
required words to be defined which were 
ifieapable tf a better definition than what thft 

o 



 old and new logic 

words themselves implied aristotle defined 
motion an act of a being in power so fer 
forth as it is in power which was as a sensible 
writer observes unintelligible jargon and 
some modems still infected by the old school 
attempt an amendment by calling it change of 
situation now one is fully as impertinent and 
obtrusive as the other every one knows what 
motion is a stone during its flight when cast by 
the hand or a sling or rolling down a precipice 
or falling from a high tower is in motion so 
is a man while walking or running a wheel 
turning round a ship sailing water running or 
any thing in — what can we say better after all 
than in motion some wretched bungler might 
substitute movementy but that would not be half 
so good as to call it the opposite of rest true 
logic does not require nay it prohibits any 
attempt to define by additional words what is 
already sufficiently clear for it generally follows 
that some of those explanatory words must be 
defined and then comes that notable absurdity 
definitions of definitions would not power 
itself seem to require here a definition 

you must take notice that dictionaries v 
not serve for definitions the meanings there 
given are of too general a character and their 
plan requires that every thing however well 
known must be explained thus they give 
motion the act of movement which is very 
correct though it may not answer the logician 
i have somewhat enlarged on this in order to 
convince you that definition is an essential 



old and new logic 

point in the art of reasoning and i must now 
inform you that it is of great extent and that it 
embraces numerous considerations on which this 
limited essay will not allow me to touch from 
the slight view taken you may perceive however 
that its difficulties have been greatly smoothed 
by the light derived from lord bacons 
organon and that the strawcavilling and the 
unprofitable minute subdivisions of aiistotle 
no longer encumber our road to this important 
department of logic 

ideas are the next branch this contains 
rules for the proper classification and arrange 
ment of all the operations of the mind by this 
you learn the relation of one thing to another — 
the necessity of a just separation when that is 
necessary for clearness and in short of avoiding 
all those incongruous associations auto which 
men not accustomed to reason metbocuoally are 
usually betrayed this requires such profound 
study and it necessarily extends lo such a 
variety of heads or particular kinds of ideas 
that it would be useless to attempt a decription 
unless in a treatise devoted to the purpose i 
shall therefore only remaik that it is by far the 
most toilsome part of logic though lord bacon 
has done much to render it less thorny and 
intricate but i will not dismiss it however 
without observing that i think it ought to be 
placed after definition and not before as is 
usually the case am afraid that this arises 
from that blind veneration of aristotle which 
has made men revere his very errors and see 



oi old and new logic 

danger in a departure even from his routine 
because he though probably his collators 
placed the categories before the interpretation 
so our modem writers on logic must needs 
follow the same order without daring to question 
its propriety true they give this reason that 
definition is only a further help to the compre 
hension of ideas but i will venture to call it the 
hornbook of logic and if that be admitted it 
should undoubtedly be first it seems to be 
naturally the preliminary step to logic and as it 
is not very hard to be understood it would be a 
good preparation for the much more difficult 
part that of ideas no study is so dry or so 
vapid as logic in pursuing latin greek 
algebra mathematics the idlest and dullest 
youth knows that if he persevere he will learn 
them but in the dreary desert of logic the most 
attentive and diligent see but little reward for 
their labor and not more than one in some 
hundreds stick to it except through compulsion 
it behoves us then to do all we can to make the 
way easy and by beginning with definition the 
pupil might be the more readily encouraged to 
proceed farther i am sorry to say that 
notwithstanding all our pretended improvements 
we have yet no work on logic that offers any 
inducement to even a sedate and settled man for 
its study the attempts to blend the plainness 
of bacon with the gaudiness of aristotle have 
considerably increased our difficulties and the 
worst of it is that our writers leat i might almost 
say invariably more to aristotle than bacon 



old and new logic 

it may appear impudent and i believe it is 
for me to dictate to professed logicians in their 
orders or arrangements but as i do not offer 
my suggestions in any spirit of petulancy i do 
not think that an apology is necessary 

you are to note that what i have called 
 ideas might as well have another name and 
i use that in deference to custom only after 
definition a certain preparation for reasoning is 
necessary and indeed the old plan is intolerably 
tedious and farcically abstruse it tends mora 
to darken than to illuminate the way and 
requires a complete change altogether a 
valuable compendium might be compiled fixm 
bacons initiatory instructions but as we have 
not that i shall go on apd observe that the 
 ideas take in such a large portion of logical 
elements and fmnish such a variety of the toois 
required that little more remains then but to go 
to woik yet our teachers still make us proceed 
to the study of syllogisms though that vague 
process has been justly supeiseded by the more 
rational and efficient operation of induction 
the reason that they give is that the syllogism 
cannot be dispensed with and that it must 
therefore continue to be an indispensable con 
sdtuent of logic it is true that we all syllogise 
tmavoidably for when we make an assertion 
and back it by a for or because and suppcnl it 
still further by a therefore or for which reason 
we syllogise as thus — 

i know that mr dee was at home this morn 
ing at ten oclock r though his servant dented 



 old and new logic 

bim my messenger wlo knows his voice well 
heard him speaking at the time in the parlour 
and therefore or for which reason i am certain 
he was then at home 

now who denies that we do and must 
syllogise in spite of ourselves no one i 
believe but we deny that it is an argument 
for making the art of reasoning to depend on 
syllogisms wood or iron is found to be the 
best material for doors but is that a reason that 
we should build our houses with either one or 
the other in preference to marble stone or 
bricks the syllogism may be convenient but 
it is not fit for the construction of a logical 
edifice if a syllogism be true it is nothing 
more than a truism i e a thing that no one 
denies like two and two making four and it 
consequently neither strengthens nor weakens 
an argument but if it be false it can be 
shattered to pieces by induction which admits 
of no quibbling the old way was if a syllo 
gism were contested to require it to be refuted 
by another but now we attack it by induction 
and regularly examine its materials if opposed 
to one who argues on the syllogistic plan we are 
not bound to produce syllogisms in reply — we 
oppose him by induction and if he object to 
that we may be quite certain that he is not 
worth contending with and we may fairly 
decline any further argumeut no false 
syllogism can resist the inductive process of 
sifting particulars the last one would not 
stand a moment before it because the assertoi 



old and new logic 

gives us in the first place only secondary 
evidence that of his messenger but supposing 
that he went himself instead we should require 
seme better proof than his own mere assertion 
of there being no possibility of his mistaking the 
sound of mr dees voice again — supposing 
that he actually saw him i tibe parlour why 
then we must in common courtesy admit his 
assertion but then there will be no occasion for 
the therefore or conclusion indeed the very 
best constructed syllogisms are only superero 
gations as to their conclusions for any one 
can see that the conclusion is not a proof 
elicited in consequence of the propositions 
they already contain it in themselves and 
therefore the civilest thing that can be said of the 
conclusion is that it is superfluous but lest it 
may be thought that i am now sayitig too much 
from myself i shall give a quotation from lord 
kaims progress of reason — 

 aristotle has done hurt to the reasoning 
faculty by drawing it out of its natural course 
into devious paths his artificial mode of 
reasoning is no less superficial thaqi intricate i 
say superficial for in none of his logical works 
is a eingle truth attempted to be proved by 
syllogism that requires a proof the propositions 
he undertakes to prove by syllogism are all of 
them selfevident take for instance the 
following proposition that man has a power 
¦of selfmotion to prove this he assumes the 
following axiom pon which indeed every one 
•of is syllogisms are founded viz that 



 old and new logic 

whatever is true of a number of particulars 
joined together holds true of every one sepa 
rately which is thus expressed in iccal termff 
whatever is true of the genus holds true of 
every species founding upon that axiom he 
reasons thus all animals have a power of 
selfmotion man is an animal ergoy man has 
a power of selfmotion now if all animahi 
have a power of selfmotion it requires no 
argument to prove that man an animal has that 
power and therefore what he gives as a con 
elusion or consequence is not really so it is 
not inferred from the fundamental proposition 
but is included in it at the same time uie 
selfmotive power of man is a fact that cannot 
be known but from experience i add that the 
selfmotive power of man is more cleariy 
ascertained by experience than that of any odi 
animal and in attempting to prove man to be 
a selfmotive animal is it not absurd to found 
the argument on a proposition less certain than 
that undertaken to be demonstrated what h 
here observed will be found applicable to the 
bulk if not the whole of his syllogisms 

i beg you to read this quotation attentively 
for i confidently assure you that whatsoever 
our aristotlestricken logicians may say to the 
contrary what is there asserted cannot be easily 
overturned our most celebrated reasoners are 
of the same opinion and it will be quite suffi 
cient to mention the name of locke he held 
the syllogism as a basis for logic in utter con 
tempt and yet where shall we find so profound 



old and new logic 

a reasoner his work on the human under 
standing though frequently assailed is read i 
mean only a select part of it in all the universi 
ties of christendom and even where aristotelian 
logic is still taught notwithstanding that it is an 
admirable specimen of the force of the inductive 
or baconian process and a powerful antidote 
against the quackery of syllogistic argument 
but why is lockes work countenanced by those 
professed baconhaters that is easily an 
swered — they were shamed into it which is a 
well authenticated fact nor are all their peripa 
tetical skulls united even yet able to produce 
any thing equal to it for solidity they find 
that induction resists all their artillery of syl 
logisms and their heaviest battering train of 
sophisms and yet still they cry with all the 
obduracy of unmeaning conservatism bar 
bara cesare and darepti yea and baralipton 
too for ever huzza these are barbarous 
words invented for the analysis of syllogistic 
jigures 

dr watts who i believe would bring in the 
bible if he were writing on algebra finding syl 
logisms in scripture imbibes such a veneration 
for them that one can see plainly on reading 
his logic that he thinks there can be no reason 
ing without them now that is a poor defence 
of the syllogism for of all books the bible is 
that which stands the least in need of logic we 
receive it as gods word and do not question 
its precepts logic has been indeed used and 
properly too to prove it of divine authmity for 



c old and new logic 

the satisfaction and conviction of unbelievere 
but having done that it would be irreverent to 
enforce by logic truths that we require to be be 
lieved even where they are as for instance the 
trinity beyond our comprehension 

the doctrine of syllogisms is no longer ne 
cessary in studying logic and it is quite sufficient 
to have just such a knowledge of them as will 
enable you to understand the difference between 
the old and new systemtii would not say this 
well knowing it to be an assertion of some con 
sequence did not feel myself backed by men 
of ten thousand times my own judgment and i 
will venture still farther by declaring my opinion 
that were a man as well skilled in syllogistic 
lore as aristotle himself he would not be the 
more advanced in what is really the art of rea 
ioning l e a sincere desire for the enforcement 
of truth 

after going through the ordinary rudiments 
which are in great part drawn as was before 
observed from the precepts of aristotle the next 
step to actual working or induction is the idols 
or prejudices this great improvement in logic 
belongs solely and entirely to lord bacon and 
it is impossible to praise or to estimate it too 
highly he lays down as a leading principle 
that it is hopeless to pursue any investigation 
successfully without first divesting ourselves of 
certain prejudices arising from the infirmities of 
human nature itself and fiom our education 
habits company associations prepossessions 
fallacy and incompetency of the senses and nu 



old and new logic 

merous other causes extending even to our very 
constitutions these he lays out under four 
general heads or classes and very particularly 
details ose that belong to each class — so that 
the vihole together forms a complete view to 
which nothing indeed seems wanting of all the 
obstacles that impede accurate reasoning and 
investigation of the sciences of such import 
ance did he consider this scrutiny that lie labors 
it with unusual precision as if he wished to im 
press that induction or any the best devised 
system could avail but little unless we come to 
it with an unbiassed mind and an understanding 
emancipated from those prejudices that impair 
tle judgment 

the world has seldom seen a finer production 
than this part of bacons organon but it is not 
fet appreciated as it deserves without any 
other knowledge of the art it would of itself 
alone make a tolerable logician for accurate 
reasenihg depends in a great measure on free 
dom from prejudices it ought tp be peculiarly 
acceptable to christians because it teaches hu 
mility and the suppression of vanity and self 
love though i do not remembei that this view 
has been ever taken of it before i have some 
times pushed this consideration farther so as to 
think that no pagan could have produced it on 
account of its being so remarkably opposed to 
the notions inculcated by heathenism — but enough 
of that lest i be carried too far in my admiration 
one cannot however sufficiently laud the mag 



 oiid and n£w logic 

nanimity of bacon in givmg the prejudices as 
an indispensable part of logic he knew 
that it must be exceedingly unpalatable to the 
aristotelians — he knew he could not but know 
that while during his own lifetime he could 
hardly expect half a dozen adherents a whole 
army of opponents would presently start up btt 
nobly disdaining any immediate fame he rnaaw 
fully resolved to write for posterity and to iliai 
mine future ages 

but you will perhaps ask and the queationr 
would be by no means unreasonable what is 
this treatise on prejudices after all but a good 
moral lecture such as one might expect from 
the pulpit granted that it broaches soimd 
morality it has two other distinguishing merits 
first it is so inseparably connected with indue 
tion that without it we cannot proceed to rea 
son inductively and next it is a masterly ex 
amination and a most comprehensive detail f 
all the sources whence those prejudices spring 
that are apt to warp or mislead the judgment 
and this task is executed with such surprising 
minuteness and fidelity that it must ever remain 
as a monument of intellectual power such as 
none but a mighty genius could erect i wish 
that i could induce you to think so highly of thid 
part of the baconian logic as i do myself fori 
though enthusiastic admiration may be some 
times a fault its more general study would be 
sides inevitably conducting us into the right 
channel of reasoning go a good way to realize 



old and nbw logic 

all that seems practicable in mr owens amia 
ble but visionary scheme to imbue us with more 
cbaritable notions towards each other 

lord bacon then enters into other disquisi 
tions previous to the exposition of his grand 
plan of induction these chiefly relate to the 
errors of former philosophers and logicians and 
to the necessity of our pursuing a different 
method in all our inquiries they form a va 
luable mass of instructions in reasoning but this 
short notice of them is enough here the next 
and last step is induction by which you really 
go to work in fact and in earnest but that i 
have already explained sufficiently for our pre 
sent purpose 



having thus exposed the two systems clear iv 
enough as i should suppose to show you the 
diffbrence of bo i have written to little purr 
pose if you do not now nearly understand how 
the human mind was enslaved by aristotle for 
 years till bacon set it at liberty ne 
vertheless wishing to do all that i can towards 
this object i shall throw together some other 
observations that may afford you further assist 
ance 

i shall here observe that my description of 
the books composing aristotle s organon is 
chiefly taken from dr reid he is one of the 
few who has read his author for most of our 
writers on logic know nothing of aristotle ex 



g old and new logic 

cept through the narrations and commentaries of 
others though they talk much of his obscure 
style just as if they had great labor in making 
out the sense hardly one of them reads him 
in the original greek nor yet even in the latin 
translation which is much easier — they glean 
their knowledge from the explanations of oihr 
indefatigable ancestors and thus appear prodi 
giously knowing by a kind of secondhand 
learning i mention this to show them that 
they must not think that they impose on every 
one though we must admit that their impositions 
are very extensive dr reid too makes a fair 
distinction between the philosophy and the logic 
of aristotle while the superficial gentlemen te 
whom i have alluded seem not to know how to 
separate one from the other though they very 
magnanimously stoop to write for the logical in 
struction of youth 

difference as to difficulty betw£en 
the old and new systems 

a very general notion prevails among ihose 
who have only a slight knowledge of logic that 
the baconian method is far easier than the arils 
totelian it is natural to suppose this though 
the contrary is the fact the torturing per 
plexity of syllogisms was indeed both vexatious 
and unprofitable but though that part is replaced 
by induction which is very easily comprehended 
yet on the whole the new method is the most 
laborious but it is necessary that you should 



old and new logic 

understand this clearly when i say laborious 
i mean in point of real work the old method 
was certainly more difficult to learn because it 
consisted of a complicated and intricate machi 
nery which required a knack to manage but 
when that knack was acquired skill and cun 
ning chiefly did the rest it did not exercise 
the depths of the understanding as induction 
does for it only skimmed the surface induction 
demands considerably more mental abor and 
besides it requires much toilsome research — a 
thing we might say unknown to aristotelian 
logic but if induction be more laborious we 
are better paid for our labor since we are almost 
certain to elicit something worth notice whereas 
the old method offered nothing as a reward to 
the truly sensible mind 

aristotlbs errors 

this great philosopher k not entitled to such 
unqualified praise as his devotees would exact 
he made numerous important errors but it may 
suffice to notice his astronomical ignorance 
with his usual dogmatic presumption he insisted 
that the sun and planets went round the earth 
and in circular orbits for he had peculiar notions 
about the perfection of circular motion as he 
was the great lawgiver of science no one was 
minded who dissented from him and this vidi 
culous theory was believed for near years 
i e down to the time of copernicus 

here the admirers of aristotle have no ex 



 old and new logic 

cuse whatsoever we do not blame him br 
not discovering the true planetary system but 
we are justly indignant at his rejectiou of it 
when discovered two centuries before he 
was bom pythagoras who was also a greciaii 
philosopher demonstrated the true theory and 
what is more surprising considering the poor 
state of instruments or other astronomical aids 
at that early period that the planets moved ia 
eliptical orbits aristotle had thus the tnitk 
ready proved to his hand but he was either not 
enlightened enough to comprehend it or not 
honest enough to admit it his defenders must 
take either horn of the dilemma and either is 
sufficiently humiliating 

now what can compensate for aristotle hav 
ing thus kept mankind for so many centuries 
in such lamentable ignorance not surely his 
natural history ethics politics rhetoric or 
poetics no it were better that he had never 
written a line than to have inflicted such a ter 
rible injury on astronomical knowledge 

as far as any one can pretend to judge of 
what might be it seems a fair question whether 
the world would not have been benefited had 
aristotle never been bom that he was the 
propagator of this follacious planetary scheme 
must be assumed as a fact for i am sure that 
his warmest defenders will admit that a word 
from him would have established the pythago 
rean system but we need not go beyond his 
own testimony here are his words heavy 
bodies naturally tend to the centre of the uni 



old and new looic 

erse we know by experieoce that heavy 
bodies tend to the centre of the earth therefore 
iie centre of the earth is the centre of the uni 
rerse have we not here a proof that he ad 
vocated this absurd theory and does it not at 
once clearly exhibit the scienceretarding nature 
of both his philosophy and his logic he takes it 
for granted without the least evidence and con 
trary to truth that all heavy bodies tend to the 
eentre of the universe and then he proves the 
earth to be that centre by an impertinent syl 
ksm 

had aristotle never appeared men might 
have wandered about cchisiderably for want of a 
fixed plan of reasoning but those very wans 
derings however dishucting for a while must 
give a freedom to thought that would end in 
something rational and probably light at last on 
induction whatever might have been the re 
oh it is hard to imagine that they could have 
led ta a more mischievous system than syllogis 
tic reasoningy for that is dogmatic logic which 
must ever be a fruitful source of error may 
we not at all events suppose that the pytha 
gorean doctrine would have been adapted which 
would alme have rescued mankind from innu 
merable frdse notions and have given a better 
direction generally to opinion and speculation 

what i hanre said respecting the probability 
of a better logic will not on due consideration 
appear to be mtiher visionary or too fanciful for 
it is in some measure strengthened by feet all 
classical scholars have heard of the socrati 



 old and new logic 

method of disputation and if they know it they 
must adnait that it approaches very near to iu 
duction it was a mild and unpresuming mode 
of enforcing truth by first asking a question as 
it were purely for your information when that 
was answered you asked another that seemed 
at variance with it and begged your friends as 
sistance to reconcile the difference this brought 
on a general drcussion in which you watched 
his discrepancies though you alluded to them 
only as if with a view to assist him but if be 
used a word in two different sensesyou requested 
to know which he meant to the end that you 
may neither misconceive nor misrepresent what 
he really wished to express if you drew him 
at length into obvious contradictions and you 
saw that he was getting angry you seized the 
first opportunity to close the argument ou the 
plea that you had pushed it too roughly and 
would be glad of some time to review what you 
had said the consequence of this conciliating 
procedure was that if you really had truth at 
your side the next time you met your friend 
you had generally the satisfaction of hearing him 
admit that he believed you were right 

this method of argument might be consider 
ably varied so as to avoid the suspicion of any 
fixed or settled plan but its general feature was 
conciliation and suavity now as its founder 
socrates lived before aristotle it might have 
prevailed and have been shaped into a regular 
system of logic were it not for aristotle for 
when his glittering scheme came out ias men ar 



old and new logic 

always taken with show and pageantry the un 
ostentatious process of socrates appeared too 
simple and it presently fell before that which 
promised victory to both sides an irreparable 
injury was thus done to logic and consequently 
to the whole course of the sciences since logic 
i admitted to be necessary for studying the 
sciences 

i must here observe that at aristotles death 
is writings were lost and not recovered tiu 
about two centuries after because much is said 
icodcerning that circumstance it is alleged that 
during this kmg period the world was free to 
adopt any other system but that is not true 
greece uiough so small a spot was then the 
world with reference to learning or science and 
both the logic and philosophy of aristotle were 
in effect preserved through his pupils by tra 
dition the spirit of them certainly remained 
and kept down any other attempt at improve 
ment because they suited the greeks who were 
of a lively airy turn and delighted in showing 
their skill in extempore disputation this made 
his logic particularly acceptable and though it 
was not so complete as when his works were 
recovered enough of it was remembered to 
cause the rejection of any other we may 
therefore fairly ascribe to him all those evils 
to science and reasoning which are so much 
deplored there is no exaggeration in the 
round numbers of years that are ge 
fierally ascribed to his dominion over the humah 
nind down to bacon he was teaching his 



 old and kew logic 

logic long before be published it and when 
bacons system appeal bis reign was witbin 
a trifle of years but we may reckon it 
as exceeding tha because unfortunately for tiie 
world bacon had little influence till a longtime 
after his death especially in england to her 
great shame it was on the continent that jtis 
merit was first appreciated 

a curious defence of aristotle which i forgot 
when noticing his book on sophisms is that he 
did not invent sophistry as there were before 
his time several philosophers called sophists 
who prided themselves on putting down an op 
ponent whether right or wrong but what did 
aristotle did he like socrates oppose those 
shameless ba£ers of truth no but on the 
contrary he materially aided them by his book 
on sophisms which was to all intents and pur 
poses a manual for their greater convenience 
sophistry was originally only irony to annoy 
the petty philosophers who then pestered greece 
but when aristotle gave it a place in his logic 
the sophists saw its valine and used it to attack 
both truth and falsehood 

here is another instance to show that aris 
totle was not a witch as the vulgar say nor yet 
a sorcerer it is taken from lord kaims and 
i shall give it without a word of observation — 

 many reasonings have passed current in tbe 
world where premises and conclusion are both 
of them felse aristotle who wrote a book 
upon mechanics was much puzzled about the 
equilibrium of a balance when unequal weights 



old and new logic 

are hung upon it at different distances from the 
centre having obsened that the arms of the 
balance described portions of a circle he ac 
counted for the equilibrium by a notable argu 
ment all the properties of the circle are 
wonderful the equilibrium of the two weights 
that describe portions of a circle is wonderful 
ergoy the equilibrium must be one the properties 
of the circle what are we to think of aris 
totles logics when we find him capable of such 
childish reasoning and yet that work has been 
the admiration of the world for centuries upon 
centuries nay that foolish argument has been 
espoused and commented upon by his disciples 
for the same length of time 

you have had already a specimen of aristo 
tles sapiency in defining motion and which 
if followed up would reduce definition as indeed 
it did to a mere childs play about absurd at 
tempts at useless distinctions i shall now give 
you another instance of this as noticed by the 
preceding author zr 

 can anything be more selfevident than the 
difference between pleasure and motion yet 
aristotle attempts to demonstrcue that they are 
different no motion says he except circular 
motion is perfect in any one point of time there 
is always something wanting during its course 
and it is not perfected till it arrive at its end but 
pleasure is perfect in every point of time being 
the same fiom the beginning to the end the 
•difference is clear from perception merely but 
is far from being clear from this demonstration 

b 



 old and nsw logic 

besides the puerility of this demonstration 
cannot we perceive something like an insinuation 
if his meaning can be at all divined that motion 
is necessary to pleasure certainly on a pro 
found examination i believe that ihey will be 
generally found inseparable but not always 
so however a man heartily tired with heard 
marching feels pleasure and great pleasure too 
in sitting immoveable on a comfortable seat — 
insomuch that he experiences an interruption of 
that pleasure if obliged to stoop for his handker 
chief should he drop it accidentally 

these instances show that this great philoso 
pher and great he undoubtedly was cannot justly 
be deemed that paragon of wisdom which his ad 
mirers work themselves up to believe for they 
might be yet multiplied though i shall add only 
what dr reid says 

 in the ancient philosophy there is a ran 
dance rather than a defect of first principles 
many things were assumed under that charac 
ter without a just title that nature abhors a 
vacuum that bodies do not gravitate in their 
proper place that the heavenly bodies undergo 
no change that they more in perfect circles 
and with an equable motion such principles as 
tiiese were assumed in the peripatetie philosophy 
without proof as if they were selfevident 

vou see by the word peripatetic that dr 
reid who will shortly assist us much imputes 
those errors to aristotle and it was only in 
mercy to him that he spared a more formidable 
exhibition 



old and new looic 

the miad cannot contemplate witbout excited 
feelings the loss that astronomy alone has sus 
tained by aristotle copernicus published his 
work de revol orb in whichiwas only 
a revival of the pythagorean doctrine and not 
withstanding that sevotai eminent men were sue 
eessively clearing tiie way for newton by im 
portant discoveries die principia did not appear 
till almost two hundred years afterwards since 
that time the bare names of distinguished labor 
ers who have been hard at work at the study 
would fill a volume apd yet we know that much 
still remains to be done we certainly can 
show a good deal but we must not forget that 
it is the labor of near years and the great 
est part of those aided throughout europe by 
royal encouittgment and all asieted by the 
powerful arm of printing the erroneous sys 
tem of aristotle prevailed for years and 
if fae had sanctioned prthagoras in what a state 
taittst not astronomy have been down to copemi

mnence before piiikting there would have been 
 years of comparative experience instead of 
which the whole were in a great measure 
lost to astronomy by aristotles abiburd immove 
ability of the eartti 

to aristotle may also be attributed the in 
numerable sects of pitiable philosophers with 
which the world so long abounded and wh 
seemed to vie with each odier in exuberance of 
iblly as to instance the sceptics it is true that 



 old and new logic 

they first appeared rather before aristotle but it 
was certainly his lc that caused the spread oi 
their tenets seeing the imposdbility of coming 
at truth by his system and being unable to over 
throw it by a better some men began to suspect 
that there was no such thing at all as truth or that 
if there were nature would not or could not re 
veal it to human understanding accordingly 
the academics professed to know nothing and 
spent their lives in asking questions of others 
in order to discover if any one else knew any 
thing but the pyrrhonists reproached them 
with being only a kind of mongrel doubters in 
asmuch as they admitted that they knew nothing 
which was acknowledging that they knew some 
thing whereas they the pyrrhonists doubted 
whether they doubted that they knew nothing 
were not these fine pranks for the philosophy 
cal world to be playing and yet des cartes 
a french thinker who died so lateas hadiv 
a strong tincture of this frivolity he spent 
some years in fiiiitless endeavours to discover 
something of which he could be certain and at 
length after a patient hatching the shell 
of his understanding opened and happily brought 
forth a panacea for his doubts in the shape of his 
own existence but i will let lord kaims 
describe this wonderfiil phenomenon and particu 
larly because he treats des cartes with tho 
highest respect 

 he des cartes was the greatest geometer 
of the age he lived in and one of the greatest pf 



old and new logic 

any age which insensibly led him to overlook 
intuitive knowledge and to admit no proposition 
but what is demonstrated or proved in the regu 
lar form of syllogism he took a fancy to 
doubt even of his own existence till he was con 
vinced of it by the following argument coffua 
ergo sum he wrote according to the en custom 
of the learned in latin thmky therefore i 
esffist and what sort of a deonxistration is this 
after all in the very fundamental propositiob 
he acknowledges his existence by the term li 
and how absurd is it to imagine a proof neces 
sary of what is admitted to be true in the fonda 
omental proposition in the next place how 
does our author know that he inks if 
nothing is to be taken for granted an argument 
is no less necessary to prove that he thinks than 
to prove that he exists it is true that he has 
intuitive knowledge of his thinking but has he 
not the same of his existing would not a 
man deserve to be laugbed at who after warm 
ing himself at afire should imagine the following 
argument necessary to prove its existence 
 the fire bums ergo it exists 

as his lordships forcible reasoning cannot be 
strengthened by anything that i could say i 
shall content myself with directing your attention 
to the beginning where he alludes to syllogistic 
argument and where you hae a melancholy proof 
of its workings when we see the intelligent 
mind of a des cartes absolutely hoodwinked 
and hugging itself in comfortable deception we re 
cognise the danger of following aristotle he 



 old and new logic 

resolutely opposed lie philosophy bot he unfor 
tanately tbllowed his logic and the usual conse 
quence ensued that he reasoned unsoundly 

this logic backed by an an eqnally fallacious 
philosophy operated as a dragchain on almost 
every study and its influence penetrated where 
one might suppose that it could not be felt 
vou will probably be surprised to learn that 
chemistry which ieems more like an art than a 
science suffered in a greater proportiin by it 
than perhaps any thing else and yet this can be 
as well proved as any historical t accuse 
tomed in reasoning to explore first causes 
rather than effects the oldcheroists pursued the 
same injudicious routine and speilt their time in 
such fanciful pursuits that they commonly ended 
in being alchymists or persons who believed i 
possible to transmute the baser metals into gcad 
— in popular language to find the philosophies 
tone if in the course of their experiments 
they made any useful discovery it was generally 
owing to chance for nothing but an inductive 
process will lead to discovery by judgmeut in 
chemistry even the illustrious roger bacon 
who is reputed to have possessed more general 
knowledge than ever fell in either ancient or 
modem time s to the lot of any single individual 
degraded his mighty genius by alchymical expe 
riments though a common tinker would now be 
ashamed to own that he believed in the art of 
goldmaking 

in short this subtle logic affected the whole 
range of science by leading men at once into 



old and new logic 

airy speculations beyond human capacity aiid 
teaching them to despise the laborioub and re 
gular approaches of induction by which only we 
can distinguish attainable from unattainable 
knowledge to what else can we attribute the 
great extension of astrology or the art of fore 
telling events by the stars men of the finest 
intellect spent their lives in this ridiculous study 
deceiving alike themselves and others and even 
now the large sales of piedictiug almanacs 
would show that there are still many ranking 
above the vulgar who believe in this trickery 

i cannot help thinking too that christianity 
suffered not a little by aristotle we know what 
turmoil and vexation the early fathers expe 
rienced from the various heresies that were con 
stantly springing up and how ineffectual their 
pious labours were in many instances to stem 
the progress of error but we need not wonder 
at these occasional failures the leaders of 
those sects were men who had all the learning 
of the times and of course they argued through 
all the wiles of syllogistic logic the others 
were obliged to meet them with the same wea 
pon for if they did not they would iu those 
days seejn unable to contend and as it was 
specially contrived for endless disputation a 
practised opponent might appear not to be van 
quished even when truth and reason were manir 
festly against him some of those heretics 
broached doctrines that could not stand a mo 
ment before rational logic but the sort then 
in use could give plausibility to the most absurd 



 old asd new logic 

tenets— even to a t heism itself accordingly 
all those leaders ibund adhiffcnis no matter hour 
contrary to scripture their precepts were and 
the true church of christ notwithstanding the 
vigilance of her pastors was scandalised and 
hurt by men who would have been impotent but 
for anstotles logic 

if i should seem in some of my observatiou 
to bear radier hard on aristotle recollect thta 
my object is to arm you so as not to be bam 
boozled by the extravagancies of his defendi 
of all enthusiasts they may be ranked amongst 
the most incorrigible nothing will satisfy them 
but the absolute perfection of their idol for in 
this they are as determined as a turk is to hear 
nothing against mahomet and every one who 
will not join in their adoration is reproached by 
them as an ignoramus or an infidel in reason 
no one can speak of any imperfection in this 
god of their idolatry without a certainty of being 
assailed volumes have been written iaiiit 
locke for his strictures on the syllogism and 
there is not a line of my quotations £nm lord 
kaims but what has been fiercely attadsed 
even his remarks on the famous definition of 
 motion have been bitterly impugned though 
he happens not to be the first who noticed tiiis 
imbecile attempt for locke was before him on 
that very point and i have now l ying beside me 
an old work on icic without any authors namoy 
printed leoreeilotdship was bom wherein it 
is reprobated in much stronger language but 
those outrageous fanatics are rather ay of dr 



old and new logic 

jtceid becaase lie was a great admirer of aris 
totle and looked on him as a firstrate genius 
tie considers his stnicture of logic taken alto 
gether as the most stupendous fabric ever de 
signed and completed by the labor of ont man 
and yet with all this admiration he was too im 
partial to overlook his defects it was at the 
pressing solicitations of lord kaims that he wrote 
the accoimt of aristotles organon and he ap 
pears to have undertaken it with reluctance— 
probably because he foresaw that he would be 
compelled as a man of truth to speak unfavora 
bly of a philosopher whose vast genius he so 
highly respected now then see what he says — 

 if his aiistotles talents had been laid 
out solely for the discovery of truth and the good 
of mankind his laurels would have remained for 
ever fiesh but he seems to have had a greater 
passion for fame than for truth and to have 
wanted rather to be admired as the prince of 
philosophers than to be usef ul so that it is 
dubious whether there be in his character most of 
e philosopher or of the sophist 

what do you thinkof that but we go on — 
 his writings carry too evident marks of 
that philosophical pride vanity and envy which 
have often sullied the character of the learned 
observe this picture of his honesty as a writer — 

 his conduct towards the writers that 

went before him has been much censured 

 he rarely quotes an autiior but with a view to 
censure and is not very fair in representing the 
opinions which he censures the faults we have 

f 



 old and new logic 

mentioned are sucb as might be expected in a 
man who had the daring ambition to be trans 
mitted to all future ages as the prince of philo 
sophers as one who had carried every branch of 
human knowledge to its utmost limit and who 
was not very scrupuloiis about the means le took 
to obtain his end 

note particularly the last sentence which i 
have put in italics as a sketch of aristotles chi 
racter speaking of his definitions he says — 

 the principles laid down by locke with 
regard to definition and with regard to the abuse 
of words carry conviction along with them 
 if aristotle had understood those principles 
many of his definitions which furnish matter 
of triumph to his enemies had never seen the 
light let us impute them to the times rather than 
to the man 

and so we will but does not this show that 
aristotle was at least fallible though every petty 
whipster will abuse a kaims or any one else 
who exposes the absurdity of his definitions 
now as to syllogisms which are the prop and 
stay of his entire system and which his mis 
guided friends defend with a zeal bordering on 
ferocity hear what dr reid says — 

 the whole theory of syllogisms he claims 
as his own and as the fiuit of much time and 
labor and indeed it is a stately fabric a nionu 
ment of a great genius which we could wish to 
have been more usefiilly employed 

there what do you think of that is it 
not a very strong opinion as to the utility of 



old and new logic ss 

fiyllogisms but we will continae our extracts 
treating of the second book of frst analytics 
he says — 

 we have likewise precepts giiren in this 
book both to the assailant in a syllogistical dis 
pate how to carry on his attack with art so as 
to obtain the victory and to the defendant how 
to keep the enemy at such a distance as that he 
shall never be obliged to yield 

now after this undisguised exposition and by 
one who admired aristotle of the dishonest ten 
dency of syllogistic art are we to throw away a 
locke a kainos or a reid and to surrender 
our reason and judgment into the hands of men 
who write logical treatises for colleges no 
surely not let them weary hapless youths with 
syuogistic leamingy and sneer at induction but 
i hope that you will not be one of their dupes 
nor suffer yourself to be frighted out of your 
propriety by such bugbear declaimers again 
see what our author says when specially treating 
of tiie syllogistic theory considered as an en 
gine of science — 

 the slow progress of useful knowledge 
during the many ages in which the syllogistic 
art was most hily cultivated as the only guide 
to science and its quick progress since tiiat art 
was disused suggest a presumption against it 
and this presumption is strengthened by the puer 
ility of the examples which have always been 
brought to illustrate its rules 

he goes on— and i pray yon to read what 
follows with marked attention — 



 old and new logic 

 the ancients seem to have had too high 
notions of the force of the reasoning power in 
nian and of the art of syllogism as its guide 
mere reasoning can carry us but a very little way 
in most subjects by observoiion and expert 
ments properly conducted the stock of humittbl 
knowledge may he enlarged without end but the 
power of reasoning alone supplied with vigor 
through a long hie would only carry a man 
round like a horse in a mill who labors hard 
but makes no progress 

observe particularly the part that i have put 
in italics that alludes to induction and yob 
may there estimate its value in comparison to 
syllogising you see that our author by no 
means denies the necessity of a regular isystem 
of reasoning b ut he mainta ins in substance that 
asl it will carry us only apart of theway we 
must bring it finally to bear on induction if we 
look for any result the whole paragraph fomis 
indeed an admirable epitome of what profitable 
logic is and you would do well to treasure it up 
in your memory 

inaccuracy of method is a serious defect m 
any system of logic yet dr reid shows by a 
very remarkable fact that aristotle who is held 
up as fauulese by his worshippers failed in this 
important particular — 

 in his enumeration of topics aristotle 
has shown more the fertility of his genius than 
the accuracy of method the writers of logic 
seem to be of this opinion for i know none of 
them that has followed him closely upon thift 
jbubject 



old and new logic 

i am amot tired of extracts for i am rery 
slow in copying and would rather write a page 
out of my own head than transcribe half a 
dozen lines yet i cannot forbear quoting the 
following i gave part of it before in my sketch 
of aristotles logic but i will not now refer you 
back as it is so very short — 

 the last book of the topics is a code of 
the laws according to which a syllogistical dis 
putation ought to be managed both on the part 
of the assailant and defendant from which it 
is evident that this philosopher trained his disci 
ples to contend not for the truth merely but for 
victory 

any one who reads this with an unpre 
judiced mind must i think turn away in 
disgust from such an insidious logic if he be 
above treachery and craft and have not a lurk 
ing or sneaking regard more for unprincipled 
triumph than conviction or truth 

those extracts are extremely valuable — com 
ing from one who had so high an opinion of 
aristotle whatever may be said of locke 
kairas campbell stewart or others dr reid 
cannot at least be classed amongst his ene 
mies they will therefore always supply 
you with answers to his friends because they 
know that the doctor well understood both his 
author and his subject his essays on the 
active powers of man furnish a proof that he 
had a great turn for logical disquisitions and that 
he reasoned soundly it would be difficult in 
deed to find any one better fitted for the task that 



 old and new iic 

he undertook and it woum require a good deal of 
sophistry to contradict lord kaims assertiooy 
 no man is better acquainted with aristotles 
writings and without any enthusiastic attach 
ment he holds that philosopher to be a firstnto 
genius 

you cannot imagine how proud i am of this 
chapter i began it merely with a view to pre 
vent you from being gulled by the specious re 
presentations of aristotles perfection but i now 
see that it is a powerful aid to my grand object 
— that of enabling you to comprehend how the 
human mind was kept enslaved for years 
till bacon broke the fetters that aristotle had im 
posed on it i flatter myself that you have 
now a clear conception of what once puzzled 
you so much if you have not i fear that i 
must despair of being able to make you under 
stand it for i do think that were i now to stop 
you ought by attentively reading what i have 
written to be completely in possession of what 
is meant by that figurative expression respect 
ing the long impionrnentof the human facul 
ties 

i will not leave you yet however it shall 
not be my fault if you complain of wanting as 
sistance and i shall therefore now give as an 
appendix a variety of considerations just as 
they occur without any regard to regular orden 
you will find however that they all bear on the 
point that i have undertaken to explain and i 
consequently recommend them for your attentive 
perusal do not pass any of them for though 



old and new logic 

some may seem to have little connexion with 
our main subject you will find that they throw 
light on it and every help is necessary towards 
arriving at its comprehension with very slen 
der abilities i have engaged in a very difficult 
undertaking and it is not unreasonable that 
before you pronounce me to have failed i should 
expect you to read every word of this book 
thst i have written

aristotles life 

on this i should not say a word were it not 
of some consequence in one poipt of view 
would you believe that the peripatetics are 
as testy here as on his writings determined 
to hold up their idol as immaculate they 
brand all both ancients and modems as 
calumniators who do not admit iu spotless pu 
rity in every respect the case stands thus 
aristotles private life according to the various 
historians is liable to suspicion as to honorable 
or disinterested conduct and they wax exceed 
ing wroth at the slightest imputation tending to 
himg his complete perfection in question they 
represent him as surrounded from the earliest 
to the present time by enemies — their conunon 
name for all who do not join in their own ful 
some adulation and they write whole books to 
prove that his historians were either open de 
famers or were misled by fisdse reports now 
it matters little to us who are only investigating 
his logic whether he were a good or a bad 
man but is it not curious that he who had al 
ways so many admirers should not find a single 
historian of antiquity to do him common justice 
according to their assertions the thing is 

p 



 old and new logic 

really not worth our consideration i grant 
that when reading an able author it is more 
pleasing to know that he was a virtuous man 
but we must not carry t hifl to ajc else we may 
scruple to hear a sermon without first ascertain 
ing whether the preachers life correspond with 
his precepts 

but beware you have artful gentlemen to 
deal with this rage for making aristotle en

ganon began to attract considerable notice aad 
it has continued ever since unabated it serves 
to prejudice the weakminded against that noble 
worky by contrasting its author with aristode 
lord bacons character is unfortunately beyond 
defence and the insinuation thrown out is that 
nothing good could be expected from such a pcd 
luted source whereas the unsullied purity 
aristotle ought to recommend his loffic you per 
ceive now diat this bepraising of aristotles life 
answers an important object but i should hc 
that you will not be swayed by such a mia 
ble ruse de guerre bacons novum organcm 
is the most precious gift that was ever presented 
to science and were its author covered frmi 
head to foot with crimes it would not be the 
less valuable he is however immeasurably 
above the stagyrite in this respect — that he de 
livers his inestimable precepts with all the mo 
desty of a pupil at an examination before his 
masters while pride vanity and envy are 
distinguishing characteristics of the other as you 
may see in my extract no from dr reid 



old and n£v loqic 

all the faults of style and grammar — all the 
appearances of pride vanity or envy — all un 
sound reasonings inconsistencies or deviations 
from truth — all wilful omissions misquotationsy 
or injurious sifppressions— all indications of vi 
cious morality or corrupt views and in short 
all the defects that we can discover in a mans 
writings are legitimate objects of censure and 
criticism dr keid who strives assiduously to 
be impartial towards aristotle cannot forbear 
mentionmg the blemishes discernible in him ob 
an author while he says not a word to the dis 
paragement of bacon where he had scope 
enough if he looked to his life but he was too 
highaiinded or rather he had too much rectitude 
to shelter aristotle by any allusion to bacons 
frailties 

let us then leave those pious enthusiasts in 
quiet possession of their stainless philosopher 
without ofiering a word of contradiction on the 
innocency of his character as a man they 
may if they please put him among the gods 
and i believe indeed tiiat they would have done 
that long ago were it not rather a hasardous 
proceeding without greek or roman authority 

aristotles obscurity 

as a great deal is constantly said about this 
it is right that you should not be entirely unac 
quainted with a matter of so much interest to 
logicians 



 old and new logic 

it id generally admitted that aristotle wrote 
bis organon with such studied brevity as to ren 
der it very difficult in many instances to make 
out the sense of what he means this is ex 
ceedingly perplexing in addition to that while 
he is prodigal of rules he is so miserly of ext 
amples that almost every part of his work is a 
painful study to understand even when oa 
his great favorite the syllogism be is not more 
explicit instead of an example he uses the 
letters of the alphabet a b c for the termg 
of a syllogism and then goes on in this manujer 
 if a is attributed to every b and b to every 
c it follows necessarily that a may be attri 
buted to every c you may easily conceive 
that it must be very troublesome to compose a 
real syllogism from such a description and in 
fact were it not for the unwearied labors of suc 
cessive writers who have illustrated his meager 
rules by examples little now would be known 
of this fiimous organon patricius has com 
puted that down to the close of the ith centuri 
full commentaries and not a few of 
them very bulky have been written on it aad 
his other works and we have now real examjdes 
of all the rules which are a great help to the 
proper understanding of them yet dr reid 
in noticing those of syllogisms says that though 
the object was charitable to assist the imagina 
tion in the conception of matters so very abstract 
he doubts if it were prudent for the honor o 
the art as he is afraid that those examples have 



old and n£w iiooic 

only served to uncover the nakedness of the 
theory no great compliment this to either 
the syllogistic system or its commentators 

dr reid who read his authors text and did 
not like others depend on commentaries or 
paraphrases acknowledges tihedifiicalty of com 
prehending his obscure mode of writing speak 
ii of his demonstrations on the conversion of 
propositions a branch of the syllogistic theory 
he says i — 

 shall give his diemonstration of the first 
mli let a b be aii universal negative pro 
position i say that if a is in no b it will fol 
low that b is in no a if you deny this conse 
quence let b be in some a for example in c 
then the first supposition will not be true for c 
is of the b s in this demonstration if i under 
stand uy the third rule of conversion is assumed 
tiiat if b is in some a c 

this will suffice to give you some idea which 
is all that you now require of this so much 
talked of obscurity hear now the causes as 
signed that which appears to have most 
wht is that as aristoue lived chiefly by pri 
vate or public teaching he wrote his organon 
purposely obscure so as not to be comprehended 
except through his owi instructions this is 
confirmed by plutarch who gives a letter fiom 
alexander to him and his answer alexander 
complains of his haying published what he taught 
him as secrets and he replies that they are 
published and not published since they can be 
understood by no one without his aid the

allusion here was to his metaphysics and organ 
nody which were written in the acrocuic or ob 
scure style as distinguished from his other works 
as those on ethics rhetoric politics natural his 
tory which were in the exotericy i e plain and 
intelligible language 

now this is the head and front of aris 
totles offending fen which he heis been sevaelj 
abused yet who am no very ardent admirer 
of any thing but his great genius must here stp 
in to give him my feeble assistance supposing 
all this to be true though it may not be noble 
or disinterested still there is nothing in it 
baseness or criminality what is it mdte than 
schoolmasters have been always and are still 
doing they write books of instructions for 
jfjtheir pupils which arejjno use whatsoever to 
 them unless aided by their own additional in 
structions to confine ourselves strictly to our 
subject is there any one of our very numerous 
works on logic written expressly for young men 
in college that they can understand without 
their tutors aid they can answer that best 
and i think that i may safely anticipate a uni 
versal no let us therefore at least be just 
and not make that criminal in aristotle which 
as we well know is done by men who have no 
sinister or unworthy intentions 

but this obscuri is lamented by his defend 
ers as a great calamity inasmuch as it has pro 
duced interpretations of his system quite con 
trary to his meaning this is poor locic why 
do not they since they seem to know his inmost

mind fiunisli us with an unclouded view and not 
keep those valuable explanations curlishly to 
themselves god knows we have waited long 
enough lliey cannot reasonably complain df 
our impatience if we now abandon au hope 
after having given them the advantage of above 
 years consideration but the fact is and 
how could it be otherwise afber such an amazing 
combination of literary exertions that the 
organon has been feirly laid open and the re 
suit has been to uncover the nakedness of the 
syllogistic theory as an engine either for sound 
reasoning or for the development of truth 

attempt to explain induction 
by example 

induction being now of the first importance 
in reasoning i must give you whatever informa 
tion is in my power and here i have to regret 
that it is very scanty descriptions may an 
swer for buildings mechanical contrivances 
steamengines or works of art generally or even 
such sciences as astronomy and music thek 
illustration can be rendered complete by the as 
sistance of engraving but any intellectual pro 
cess is very differeirt and it cannot be under 
stood unless by very painful study if examples 
be not furnished 

now here it is that we are miserably deficient 
if aristotle was niggardly of examples bacon 
is still worse for it may be said that he gives 
none innumerable commentators hav how 



 old and new logic 

ever remedied aristoties neglect but no one 
lias as yet illustrated bacon on this i may 
have to remark hereafter and i shall now only 
observe that not having brains enough myself 
to supply an example of induction i have hunted 
a long time and can only find one that i could 
venture to ofier when i say this i mean 
that i could find only one sufficiently concise 
for our purpose for there are many splendid 
examples of induction extant as for instance 
lockes essay on the human understanding 
which is fiom beginmng to end an inductive 
process of reasoning but then for such exam 
ples as these you would have to read a very 
bulky volume through and that could not be 
cshled illustrating induction — it would be almost 
as disingenuous as aristotles occult mode who 
set his readers hard at work in the first instance 
to find out what he meant 

the example i am going to give is sir hum 
phrey davys discovery of the safety lamp you 
must know then that before its invention tlie 
workers in coalmines were in constant danger c 
an explosion of what is cued firedamp this 
is a gas that will sometimes issue imperceptibly 
fitma vein and when a certain quantity mixes 
with the common air it then becomes ignitible 
by flame only to remedy this danger as the 
miners must have light in those subterraneous 
recesses various kinds of lamps were devised 
but none of them afforded any protection that 
could be relied on as a security some used 
 steel mills or wheels which when kept rapidly 



olp and new logic 

whirling round and striking against numerous 
bints in their revolutions elicited such myriads 
of sparks as gave the miners in their vicinity suf 
ficient light tor working they were no doubt 
a perfect security but we may easily judge that 
they musty if only from their bulk be exceedingly 
inccmvenient in such a place as a mine — so trou 
blesome indeed that the wkmen generally pre 
ferred the lamps with all their awful danger a 
lamp being then the only thing that stood a chance 
of general use on account of its conyeuiait porta 
bility su humphrey davy applied himself to the 
construction of one which should secure its flame 
from any contact with the firedamp we can 
hardly imagine any discovery of greater import 
aace you have often read of explosions which 
suddenly buried numbers of human beings alive 
and sometimes rendered a mine useless after a 
prodigious expenditure of money and labor 



sir h commenced his investigation by a par 
ticular examination of firedamp so far as its 
commixture with atmospheric air was concerned 
this was a rational and regular procedure be 
cause it was absolutely necessary es a step to 
his further progress i shall not enter into the 
detail as my object is only to show his mode of 
proceeding and it must svd£ce to say that he as 
ctained by a great number of trials the va 
rious proportions of conmion air requisite for 
slight or powerfid explosions and also when 
none could take place having satisfied him 



 old and new logic 

self minutely on that heal he set about ascer 
tuning tiie temperature required for causing aa 
explosion he found that the strongest ex 
plosive mixture may come in contact witii irony 
or other solid bodies heated to redness or eren 
td whiteness without detonating provided they 
are not in a state of actual combustion whereas 
the smallest point of flame owing to its higher 
temperature instantly causes an explosion ¦ 

in this manner he went on steadily investi 
gating and patiently toting every thing neces 
sary for his great object it might be interesting 
to follow him through all his various experi 
ments and persevering researches but our pur 
pose does not require such particulars and it 
will be sufficient to observe that after havmg 
carefully examined in every possible way what 
ever appeared indispensable for preparahve 
measures he then and not till then pro 
ceeded to his ultimate aim this was as has 
been before remarked to prevent the flame of a 
lamp from coming in contact with firedamp 

sir h having thus cleared away every ima 
ginable obstacle proceeded to his grand and final 
experiment many and various were the trials 
that he made but they at leigth led to the im 
portant discovery that flame cannot pass through 
a narrow tube he next discovered that tibe 
power of tubes in preventing the transmissicm of 
flame is not necessarily connected with any par 
ticular length and that a very short one will 
have the effect provided its diameter is propor 
ijonably reduced he had now the satisfactiop 



old and new logic 

of seeing that he had attained his grand object 
but there etull remained something to he done 
to surromid a lamp with a covermg of smau 
tabes would from the nature of such workman 
ship be exceedingly expensive and what must 
be evi a great objection it would hide the 
light so as to rend the lamp almost useless 
following up his inquiries therefore he found 
that fine wire gauze was in fact an assemblage 
of short narrow tubes and consequently if a 
common oillamp be completely surrounded witii 
a cage of such gauze it may be introduced into 
an explosive atmosphere of firedamp and air 
without kindling the mixture thus was that 
invaluable acquisition the safettlamp com 
pleted by a purely inductive process of inquiry 
and experiment 

it now only remains to be observed that 
when the mixture is highly explosive it takes 
fire as soon as it has passed through the gauze 
and bums on its inner surface while the light 
in the caitre of the lamp is extinguished but 
 h previously ascertained all that and he 
furnished such directions as enable the miners 
to know by the appearance of the lamp when 
there is any danger and they can make their 
escape in perfect safety the mine is then ven 
tilated and no explosion can ever occur if they 
observe only common attention 

for the satiseution of those who are entirely 
imacquainted mth tliis lamp i shall also ob 
serve that the reason why the mixt air that gets 
through the gauze doea not exvaaai 



 olid and nrw logic 

in the passage its temperature is so lowered or 
cooled that it is not ignitible except in the ex 
treme case explained in the preceding paragraph 
i may also mention that as every one knows 
by a candle flame being much more powerful at 
the top than at the side it would soon bum the 
gauze but for the great height of the cage which 
is about five times that of the diameter of the 
lamp at bottom 

this safetylamp is an inestimable present 
to humanity and to science it has saved thou 
sands of human beings from premature and 
dreadful death and it has rendered coal the 
cheaper by preventing many collieries frcmi par 
tial or irremediable destruction which is an in 
calculable advantage as there is now no article 
of greater importance for our domestic comfort 
and for the prosecution of the arts manufactures 
and sciences the name of sir humphrey 
davy will by this discovery go down to th 
latest posterity 



this is considered to be a very pure and it 
certainly is a very important specimen of induc 
tion the method reconmiended by bachi id 
here strictly and most triumphantly followed it 
is indeed a noble instance of his plan for study 
ing the sciences yet it might be more satisfibkc 
tory to produce an example of an ordinary argu 
ment and to show how syllogistic artifice must 
yield totts superior tbrce inis is however oi 
great consequence for our main object as it 



old and new logic 

gives you a proof of how the sciences must have 
suffered by the old plan and enables you the 
better to comprehend how the human mind was 
enslaved for years till bacon came to its 
aid it will also make you understand why 
chemistry lingered so deplorably in aristotelian 
times for if we suppose one of that school at 
tempting to find out a safetylamp it will seem 
clear that he never could arrive at the discovery 
we will suppose him to know previously as much 
as davy did which was indeed no more than 
every miner knew that flame only would ignite 
firedamp his first proceeding is to make out 
a syllogism the conclusion of which is that flame 
is indispensable for the ignition of firedamp 
having thus proved satisfectorily what no one 
denied he then instead of examining as davy 
did what proportion of common air is requisite 
to produce an explosion goes into e philosophical 
investigation of fire itself in the enlarged sense 
of the word he finds that it is according to 
aristotle one of the four elements and con 
sequently a thing not to be lightly dismissed 
that flame is fire he proves by a syllogism but 
then why flames and sparks should be so very 
different in their powers — this seems to argue 
that the difference is very important it is use 
less therefore to proceed further till this point 
be probed to the bottom accordingly he rea 
sons most logically and very extensively on this 
subject assists his reasonings by numerous ex 
periments and has finally the satisfaction of de 
monstrating that that part of fire called sparks 



 old and n£w logic 

or redhot iron will not ignite any mixture of 
 atmospheric air and firedampbut that flame 
vnll 

any one else would think that he is now only 
where he was when he first set out on his voyage 
of discovery but our worthy peripatetic thinks 
very difierendy according to his profound no 
tions he believes himself to have made consider 
able progress and he now suggests the possibility 
of ascertaining by unremitting attenticm whence 
those streams of firedamp issue and then of 
stopping up the apertures as we do ratholes 
but as a great number of men should be con 
stantly employed for that purpose he does not 
think that this suggestion would be well received 
and he directs his energies towards means for 
drawing ojqfthe firedamp as this would be in 
deed an effectual remedy he labors hard to dis 
cover thef best modes but they would be all so 
expensive and generally so tedious that in 
most instances the explosion must take place 
before they could be brought into operation 
forced to see the impracticability of that he sits 
down seriously to try whether firedamp could 
not by a mixture of some other body be neu 
tralised or at least rendered comparatively harm 
less this appears to be very reasonable nox 
ious smells have been quickly destroyed in large 
apartments by overpowering them with a 
stronger and yet a more agreeably scent — ergoy 
the ignitible quality of firedamp and common 
air might be at least weakened by a mixture of 
iomething else to this end he trie innume 



 old and nsw iogic 

rable experimaits and though he does not suc 
ceed as he could wishy he feels perfectly satisfied 
like the alchymists in pursuit of goldmaking 
hat the thing will yet be discovered 

while he is thus toiling in deep philosophical 
researches the lamp seems to be lost siglit of al 
together and yet the miners insist as ignorance 
is always impatient that notliing will do but a 
lamp the flame of which shall be secured against 
contact with the external air those fellows 
do notand what is more never did in any 
times understand syllogistic argument and when 
they hear how he has been laboring for their 
good without producing any thing which they 
like brutes as they are have not intellect to 
appreciate they exclaim that he might as well 
be whistling jiggs to a milestone as to get up a 
 lamp such as would suit them by that there kind 
o way he does however ek length turn his 
thoughts towards the lamp and he then demon 
strates diat £re cannot exist without oxygen and 
that as a lamp cannot bum without a supply of 
 that fluid its flame must be in contact wiui the 
external air his conclusicm is therefore that 
it is quite impossible to contrive any lamp 
that wsl not be liable to cause explosions 
should this be doubted he is ready to confirm it 
by new syllogisms in addition to those which he 
has already given and which he pledges himself 
cannot be controverted 

now i assure you that in all this there is 
very little of exaggeration is it not proved by ex 
perience every one admits that the old che 



 old and nfiw logic 

mists madc hardly any progress during twenty 
centuries while the discoveries of the last eighty 
years fill us with astonishment we cannot as 
sign an earlier date to modern chemistry ajeid 
that means when chemists began generally to 
shake off the aristotelian fettars and apply inh 
duction to the science they then began to 
work in earnest — hefote that they were only 
philosophising 

i think that you must be highly gratified by 
this example it shows you more clearly than 
by any description the connexion of logic wftii 
the study of the sciences i dare to say tha 
notwithstanding all the pains that i had pre 
viously taken you could not well conceive what 
it had to do with chemistry which seems to be 
more a work of the hands than of the heftd and 
which requires the use of machines instruments 
and even ordinary tools you now see fikait 
plainly which was before indistinct fhis ib 
very important because every one easily appm 
hends why logic is necessary for an agmnent 
or for the discussion of abstriise questions bift 
only a few can understand how it is applicable 
to science you see also the real working of the 
two systems on the same occasion the davy 
example proves the value of induction by ite 
splendid result — the peripatetic example shows 
how valueless the old system is as to any rational 
usefulness

a peep into philosophy 

 it is right that you should know something 
vof what the philosophical world are doing you 
musty however be satisfied with even less than 
an outline a bare list of all the various sys 
temsy as they are cedled would require a heavy 
ume and i can do little more than explain 
what it is that is designated philosophy 

from the earliest ages of literature certain 
men applied themselves to the discovery of 
truth of these not only the names but the 
particular doctrines of some who lived 
years b c have come regularly down to us 
and it is scarcely necessaiy to say that they 
were grecians these men were called philo 
sophers because the business of their lives was 
to acquire what was in their opinion real know 
ledge for instance one of them anaxagoras 
who died years b c at the age of 
ufied to say that he preferred a grain of wis 
dom to heaps of gold yet still though he travel 
led into egypt for improvement some of his no 
tions particularly on the heavens were absurd 
in the extreme the discovery of truth 
means the establishing of some particular point 
tenet or doctrine b y irresistible argument s but 
unfortunately no philosopher ever yet mamtain 
ed any position or assertion that was not as 
sailed by another we may say without any 
overstraining that the aim of philosophy appears 
to be undoing rather than doing no sooner 
does a philosophical work appear than another

is preparing to refute it either partly or entirely 
demolition seems to be the grand business c 
philosophy for as new subjects cannot be always 
found there is never a lack of employment in 
taking to pieces the labors of others eveiy 
new system is followed as a matter of counie 
by its refutation and sometimes we are favored 
with retations of refutations this has been 
the usual routine of philosophy from the earliest 
times of antiquity and it still continues tiie same 
each professor tibdnks nay is quite certain that 
he is right but we who must keep at humble 
distance from such profound reasoners know 
this truth at least that they cannot be all right 
ergoy some of them are wrong 

the philosophy to which i have adverted is 
xhe higher department or that which relates to 
our faculties powers or affections and is called 
ontology or generally metaphysics here it ib 
that there is such sad disunion might i dare 
to offer an opinion i would say that it arises 
from not admitting exceptions philosophers 
maintain that there can be no exception in yof 
of any thing proved to be true or fake good or 
bad just or unjust or of any other character 
if it be true or £bdse or good or bad it must 
be so without any extenuation under every 
circumstance whatsoever this is much too 
severe for poor human nature and conse 
quently they have been laboring for twenty 
five centuries without establishing even one 
solitary unassailable truth except such little 
truisms ba have been knani to ever child iipce 



old and new logic 

the banning of the world i think that i can 
give you a clear explanation of this by an ex 
ample and it shall be by the very word tnuh 
itself you are asked is not truth good 
amd you of course unhesitatingly answer yes 
then since truth is good should it not be 
spoken at all times to which as an honest 
man you again as promptly say yes see now 
in what a predicament you stand by the fol 
lowing case — 

an amiable young gentleman who was fol 
lowed by hired assassins escaped unperceived 
hy them into the house of a rigid noexception 
philosopher who was his dearest and most inti 
mate friend and to whom he explained his 
danger the assassins coming up and seeing 
the philosopher at his door asked if he were 
there his character for veracity was such 
that on a simple denial they would have imme 
diately gone away but his principles would not 
allow him to say no and they accordingly went 
in found tlie young gentleman concealed in a 
bak apartment and murdered him 

now were you this young mans father 
would not you account our philosopher as the 
murderer of your son your answer would be 
that which every father would give and you 
would bitterly curse such wretched philosophy 
but let us examine the matter calmly and per 
haps even then we shall find nothing for admira 
tion we will suppose the philosopher deeply 
affected as no doubt he was by such a terrible 
sacrifice to principle but was there no vanity or 



 old and new logic 

selflove at the bottom of it he had acquired 
a character ior undeviating truth which would 
be lost if he swerved in this instance the assas 
sins might afterwards have learned though too 
late for their wicked purpose that the gentleman 
was in the house when they inquired and the 
philosophers fiune would be tarnished is it not 
a fair question therefore whether he sacritised 
more to selflove than to truth or principle it 
would indeed have been a noble sacrifice to 
save his innocent fiend on the altar of his own 
popularity or £bime but vanit selflove finlse 
pnde and uncontrollable ambition were stronger 
incentives 

turn this proceeding in what way soever we 
can it shows the danger and the folly of whtbt 
some weakminded men would in the simplicity 
of their hearts call philosophy nature and re 
ligion teach us to prevent as fiu as we can tiie 
perpetration of crime murder especially of 
the innocent and virtuous is one of the fink 
magnitude but according to those ravers we 
must see it committed sooner than utter the 
monosllable no nature religion and every 
thing else is with them as nothing compared to 
the iolation of a philonophical principle 

i presume to offer a remedy for this defect in 
philosophy for surely that must be a defect 
which has produced nothing tenable or available 
for our guidance en investigating any 
truth or principle after haing demonstrated its 
propriety utility or excellftnce we should then 
diligently examine whether it may not be liable 



old and new logic 

io some exceptions i know that thii proposi 
tion will be laughed at by the philosophers but 
i may laugh at them in turn since by main 
taining a contrary doctrine they are laboring in 
vain and literally doing nodxmg but wasting 
paqper human nature is too imperfect for in 
variable rules and the only way to develop 
truth is to make the necessary allowances for 
our imperfections many things are easily proved 
to be so and so but it is not quite so easy to 
prove that they are always the same ebccep 
tions are the inheritance of our nature and 
to refuse them is to despair of truth thus 
every one admits that prudence is a virtue but 
to prove satisctcvily what prudence is unex 
ceptionably may be found somewhat difficult 
however we will suppose it proved what 
thai phidence has often lost a man while 
acknowledged imprudence has saved another 
but then it will be alleged that this does not at 
eb militate against prudence being a virtue 
be it so but we must recollect diat in pro 
ttouncing prudence a virtue we mean that it 
issdom and a want of wisdom has sometimes 
proved to be more serviceable than wisdom itself 
when i mentioned prudence it was because 
it occurred to me at the moment but it is only a 
poor instance in comparison to others that might 
be adduced it serves however to show the 
necessity for an exceptive system when we 
ask for results as to those philosophers labors 
what do we find but a beggarly account of 
empty boxes they have in fact been doing 

g 



 old and new logic 

little else than quarrellingrkriocking one an 
other down for the pure love of truth but in 
stead of trying to catch an unmanageable illusion 
they might have been usefully employed in ex 
amining the imperfections of received truths 
and vithout fundamentally destroying such 
truths in enumerating and classifying the con 
tingent exceptions that must by reason of onr 
great distance from perfection inevitably occur 
by received truths i mean those only which for 
sake of convenience or morality we must admit 
such as that of prudence being a virtue — for 
when the complete fellacy of any assertion how 
ever popular or long sanctioned is discovered 
it should be vigorously attacked without the 
least ceremony had philosophers directed 
their attention as i have hinted even from the 
time of bacon without at all alluding to anterior 
ages we should now have a vast accumulation 
of valuable points of knowledge in metaphysics 
jestablished and confirmed by successive investi 
tions it would also have prevented a num 
ber of absurd theories which under the attracttite 
glare of ieaming have tended to degrade ratlier 
than to exalt the mind of man by filling it with 
dangerous doubts as to the possibility or exist 
ence of any truth 

great britain france and germany are the 
chief seats of this philosophy writers and 
systemmakers have sometimes appeared else 
where but while scotland teems with feeloso 
phers as cobbett used to call them it is re 
markable that ireland is nearly a blank in this

respect though i am far from looking on it as a 
discredit have not we plain people a right to 
inuire about what they have been doing down 
to the present time may we not respectfully 
ask whether they have fixed any one point of 
positive utility established any one rule of gene 
ral advantage or brought to light any one thing 
or principle of undeniable service to man ob 
serve that we with all our ignorance are not 
unreasonable we do not look for wonderfid 
developments or brilliant discoveries inquiries 
about our intellectual powers cannot be expected 
to lead further than to solid conclusions but 
it would appear that they have led to nothing 
decisive 

indeed if we press for results i believe that 
locke will bear away the palm by proving 
that we have no innate ideas he did actually 
open a field for practicable experiment for it 
ias on this that mr owen founded his grand 
•jooperation plan he proceeded on the 
assumption that our notions are formed for 
and not by us which is essentially the noinnate 
klea doctrine accordingly he believed it quite 
possible to educate children with notions and 
dispositions very different from what are gene 
tally inculcated and that they might be brought 
to such amiable habits as to live in charity to 
wards each other almost free from those vices 
or turbulent passions that produce such unhap 
pmess in the world he completely established 
the teasibility of his plan at new lanark for

change sufficient to justify his assertions hi 
project failed only because from the constituticm

it is difficult for us to conceive what possible 
benefit can arise from certain questions on which 
philbsophers have written volumes and vehe 
mently contradicted each other such as mans 
free will or agency and why he can stir a finger 
or let it alone just as he pleases — synchronous 
ideas or whether we can think of two things af 
once or whether the mind does not glide though 
imperceptibly from one to the other — whether 
smelling is not more in the mind than the nose 
and whether it is not thus that we distinguish 
between the disagreeable and the pleasant — 
why we can without seeing either know the 
noise of a drum from that of a cart— how we 
can fix our sight on a single speck or on an ex 
tension of miles to us it seems of no im 
portance whether such points be ever definitivdy 
settled but as philosophers have considered 
them more deeply than we our best plan is not 
to meddle with such profound matters but 
since they sometimes enter upon discussions not 
quite so harmless i think it right to observe that 
dr reid says when reprobating humes 
 shocking paradox that things may begin to 
exist without a cause what is there so ridicu 
lous as not to be maintained by some philoso 
pher 

this must suffice for ontology or the abstruse

department you see that i could not avoid 
being tedious though i fear that i have very 
imperfectly satisfied your curiosity but you 
must recollect that i have been endeavouring 
to convey some notion of what has occupied 
a hundred thousand volumes and you must give 
that consideration its due weight 
 the other branches of philosophy ar much

called after the names of their founders the

tttany valuable discoveries that enlarge our ge 
neral comforts or knowledge because they are 
chiefly based on actual inspection or experiment 
ut they are nevertheless called philosophy 
because they must necessarily embrace a good 
portion of speculation or what is purely philoso 
phical thus astronomy attempts to demon 
slxate that the earths atmosphere extends to g 
miles in height though no balloon ever yet as 
ended much beyond our highest mountains the 
business of a geologist is to explain the structure 
of our globe as far as it can be knovm yet he is

the synchronousideas philosophy because i 
think that i can make it tolerably intelligible 
they regard it as extremely important and 
it has occupied many and many a ream of 
foolscap 

this means as i said before whether we can 
think of two things at once as usual our phi 
losophers are not here in accord for some 
maintain that we can while others insist that 
there is a gliding of the mind though scarcely 
perceptible from one to another they gene 
rally illustrate the matter by a guinea one 
says he is silre when he looks at it that he can 
at once see and comprehend its circular form and 
yellow color but another is equally certain that 
he only imagines that he does so because the 
mind must pass however instantaneously from 
the circular form to the yellow color or from the 
yellow color to the circular form both parties 
lavish a great deal of logical argument to prove 
their respective doctrines yet despite of logic 
neither convinces the other for he who is iso 
chronal — look in johnson — will not yield to the 
tionisochronal nor this last to the isochronal

now you have doubtiesg seen an able master 
of the pianoforte harp or organ play at first 
sight and in strict time a piece where the bass 
was entirely different fiom the treble here to 
say nothing of chords or pedals are four distinct 
operations at once that is reading and playing 
each of the two lines but there are some who 
will in addition sing another part different froni 
the treble with words and here we have no less 
than eight operations comprising four of the sight 
two of the hands one of speaking and one of 
singing all done at the same time and without 
the advantage of any previous preparation i 
know not whether our worthy metaphysicians 
ever lighted on this but i know that i never saw 
it in any of their dissertations and i conceive that 
it goes very near proving that we can think of 
two things at once but i advise you however 
to keep your peace and never show your skfll 
by any contention of this kind you would gain 
nothing by it for the gliders would insist that our 
performer slips unawares from one operation to 
another let us admire in silence and not dis

i cannot conceal my gratification on finding 
that lord bacon strongly supports my exceptive 
views it is extremely peruous for one like 
me to hazard any suggestion concerning philoso 
phy and i am therefore greatly relieved on 
being backed by such authority he particu 
larly recommends the registering of doubts 
and that comes very close to what i have ven 
tured to propose after dividing doubts into 



old and new logic 

two kindsj particular and total he says in hi 
advancement of learning — 

the registering of doubts hath two excel 
ant uses the onesiat it saveth philosophy from 
errors and falsehoodswhen that which is not 
fully appearing is not collected into assertion 
whereby error might draw error but reserved in 
ubt the other that the entry of doubts are 
as so many suckers or spunges to draw use of 
knowledge insomuch as that which if doubts 
had not preceded a man should never have ad 
vised but passed it over without note by the 
suggestion and solicitation of doubts is made to 
be attended and applied 

the last sentence is an exceedingly bad spe 
cimen of composition but we can perceive 
however that the doctrine if it be not exactly 
my exceptive system is at least an indication of 
 and eows how difficult it is to think of any 
thing connected with reasoning that bacon has 
qot considered he further says — 

 but that use of wit and knowledge is to be 
allowed which laboreth to make doubtful things 
certain and not those that which labor la 
boreth to make certain things doubtful 

now that is not £eir from my idea about ex 
ceptions and as to what i have said on the 
utility of enumerating or pointing of them out 
i think that i am strongly supported by bacon 
for he adds — 

 therefore these calenders of doubts i com 
mend as excellent things so that there be this 
caution used that when they be thoroughly 

h 



 old and new locttc 

sifted and brought to resolution they be from 
henceforth omitted discarded and not continued 
to cherish and encourage men in doubting 

this is exactly the principle that i have in 
culcated that when the complete dlacy of any 
assertion however popular or long sanctioned 
is discovered it should be attacked without ce 
remony i am therefore eased of any scniplee 
that i may have had about an exceptive system 
and i now offer my considerations with increased 
confidence 

receipt for answering a fa 
mous question of the aris 
totelians 

when they are driven into a comer by an 
able logician who is not scared by their heaviest 
fire of popgun syllogisms they will as a last 
resource ask with seeming humility whether 
the agreement of nearly the entire learned worid 
for above years and which still continues 
pretty generally is not something like a proof 
that aristotles syllogistic system could not be 
very wrong should any of them ever put that 
question to you answer immediately no and 
then proceed to support your negation induc 
tively that is by collecting fects and instanceer 
and deducing fiom them a general conclusion 
as a single instance will in some cases serve as 
well as a thousand i shall furnish you with one 
which will set this famous question at rest — 

thr heathkn mytbology — we arj 
every day discovenng proofs that the greeki 



old and new logic 

however unwilling their historians appear in ad 
mitting it originally borrowed a great part of 
their learning science and civilisation itself 
from the egyptians that they took their my 
blogy or religion from them is not denied for 
osiris the great deity of the eigyptians was 
deemed the son of jupiter the kingdom of 
sycion was founded years b c but 
without going so fiar back we shall take no ear 
lier than the siege of troy which dates about 
 the greeks must then have been in a 
tolerably advanced state for hesiod who lived 
say two and a half centuries after says that they 
reckoned in his time gods and god 
desses — a proof that they must have been a peo 
ple of considerable literature for a long period 
before it is admitted that they engrossed learn 
ing and civilisation to themselves and that they 
justly looked on the rest of the world not except 
ing even the romans their ultimate conquerors 
as barbarians when rome became the mis 
tress of the world and the centre of polished 
society she continued the heathen mythology 
which she had originally imported from greece 
till about a d when constantine estab 
lished christianity but julian the apostate 
introduced heathenism once more about 
and though it was quickly superseded again by 
christianity we can hardly suppose that it was 
extirpated in less than a century after by 
extirpation i mean its general rejection or 
abandonment and i think i may very fairly set 
that dowti to if not now added 



 old and new logic 

to make years during which it was 
the religion of the most learned people in the then 
world as is acknowledged by all our writers 
but it was also that of egypt for probably 
years before the siege of troy though i shall say 
only to obviate any cavilling and this added 
to makes years during which the 
heathenism in question was professed by three 
of the most polished nations of antiquity suc 
cessively without including the years of its 
decline which would make 

the sun of egypt was setting when troy fell 
but she is allowed to have been the grand if not 
the exclusive emporium of learning and science 
for a long period when greece was in a rude 
state her mythology was svbstantially the 
same as that which prevailed afterwards so ex 
tensively for the vast additions of the greeks 
were only what they would call improvements 
here then we have three of the most cele 
brated communities professing during 
years such a rank absurdity as that no one for 
many hundred centuries has ventured to advo 
cate the reestablishment 

for a christian to speak of its absurdity might 
seem to be superfluous but i wish to show ex 
clusive of its incompatibility with reason or com 
mon sense its striking inconsistency even vidth 
itself to say nothing of the inferior divinities 
some of whom were murderers thieves drunk 
ards robbers or cheats and appointed to filthy 
offices from which decency tinns with disgust 
we should expect that jupiter at least the 



old and new logic 

 almighty jove would be a pure character 
but what do we find him a fornicator an 
adulterer and worse than all as supreme ar 
biter a partial and often a cruelly unjust judge 
besides several mistresses he had seven wives 
¦with the last of whom his own sister juno 
 the queen of heaven he lived very unhap 
pily owing to her wellfounded jealousy they 
used to have regular scolding matches in one of 
which words went so high that he called her 
a mtchf according to the authority i think of 
homer and he often beat her severely his 
lust was so unbridled that he has frequently 
come down from his high olympus and de 
flowered innocent maidens on eartih so that pa 
rents who had handsome daughters were kept in 
a state of constant inquietude as he was a great 
judge of female beauty and assumed shapes to 
accomplish his purpose which it would be inde 
kcate to mention even before he married lus 
sifter he violated her by stratagem 

on reading this one would think that the 
chreeks and romans set at naught chastity con 
jugal fidelity justice temperance moderation 
and all other virtues yet they estimated them 
m a certain manner while their gods and god 
desses practised all sorts of crime and here it 
is that their strange inconsistency appears 
some who are classicmad attempt their de 
fence by saying that the well informed did not 
believe in this mythology and that they kept it 
up only to overawe the vulgar but this is a mis 
erable attempt at their vindication it is in 



 old and new logic 

peril that our belief in a religion appears w 
commonly assert that sailors who never nuyed 
before do utter prayers for their souls when e 
ship is settling and all hope of saving their bo 
dies gone and we find the greeks and romans 
when under any great calamity offering solemn 
sacrifices to appease the anger of some god 
whom they had as they believed provoked by a 
neglect of his customary honors yes it is in 
vain to deny that they believed in this mytho 
logy they prosecuted the greatest men for 
idasphemy or irreverence to tiie gods and 
enforced their strict worship by nmnerous laws 
and regulations socrates himself who was 
so enlightened as to arrive at a just notion of a 
supreme being and who cheerfiilly suffered 
death sooner tiian deny it — socrates who ap 
proached so near to christianity before it was 
known had still some qualms as to respect 
towards certain gods for he acknowledged it on 
his trial and his last words were we ow a 
cock to esculapius— discharge that vow da 
cier attempts to defend this but what defence 
can avail against te simple undisputed het 

in short it betrays great ignorance to say 
that the learned did not believe in the gods 
there were to be sure some who did not but 
have not we our voltaires humes and other 
deistical writers in perhaps a greater proportion 
when the roman consuls entered into office 
they were always obliged to offer juno a solemn 
sacrifice and if we allege that none of them be 
lieved in its efficacy why then we must allow 



old and nfiw logic 

the romans to say supposing them the modems 
and we the ancients the speaker of the bri 
tish house of commons always before proceed 
ing to business prayed £br a blessing through 
christ jesusy but it is unnecessary to observe 
that none of that illustrious and enlightened body 
believed in its efficacy as the whole thing was 
merely a piece of policy for an example to john 
bull — a common name for the vulgar multitude 

so £bur from concurring in such opinions i do 
not hesitate to say that the belief of the learned 
greeks and romans was much more sincere and 
universal than what is found in christianit 
their dissentetsy if we except the epicureans 
rarely went so r as total unbelief while we 
have besides unblushing deists entire sects 
living as christians two of whom might be parti 
cularly mentioned who are justly suspected of 
not believing in the divinity of christ since they 
will never give an explicit answer on that im 
portant point 

the heathen mythology was in every possi 
ble view the most senseless ridiculous impious 
stupidly inconsistent and outrageously mon 
strous religious system that was ever devised 
it was a complete inversion of every thing in the 
nature of religion for it made the deities chief 
and all devils what can be imsined more 
unnatural than to pray and offer sacrifices to 
those whom we believe to be infamous we 
deplore the unlettered savage who worships the 
un or a piece of wood that he fashions with a 
sharp stone into a frightful gure though this 



 old ast new logic 

is not worse for nollung could be worse than 
the detestable heathen mythology the nm 
sionaries at ceylon were shocked at finding the 
natives worshipping the devil but they gave in 
substance this explanation god is too good 
to do us any harm and we tiberefore rather pro 
pitiate the devil who is constantly at work for 
our injury now that is a better reason thaa 
could be given for the abominable heathen wor 
ship for diey at least admitted one good deity 
whereas the greeks and romans seemed deter 
mined to have all their divinities male and fe 
male not excepting jove himself either shamer 
lessly bad or stained with some particular vice 
they would not let even their guardians of aiiy 
virtue remain pure and accordingly diana the 
patroness of chastity aft havmg long pressed 
her virginity at last makes a slip and not only 
prostitutes herself to endymion but agtuafly 
seduces him after that she was intimate wita 
pan and the giant orion and yet the most 
splendid temple that at ephesus which was one 
of the seven wonders of the world was erected 
and consecrated to her memory and worship as 
 goddess of chastity v 

in reviewing this sickening prostration of 
reason and common sense our only consolation 
is that such a diabolical faith for it surely was a 
worship of monsters has been so completely 
eradicated after the year or perhaps 
somewhat before no people were foolish enough 
to profess it for those who the most obsti 
nately resisted christianity as the slavons or

reviving the hettthen mythology no that 
was too gross for the wildest visionaries — too 
nonsensical even for the fitmtic — too blasphe

for the lowest rabble 

the utter ctinction throughout the worid of

if we had no other evidence of its absurdity 
yet it was the reiificn of the philosophers sag

general agreanent of the learned in any hmi 
or doctrine for any length of time is no proof at 
its soundness it has been fully demonstrated 
that the syllogistic system is inefieicient as an 
engine for the discovery of truth or for studyii 
the sciences — it has been tested experiment 
ally by the superiority of induction and an ajj 
peal to its being so long cherished by the leametl 
is no better argument than to say that because 
they so long believed in the heathen mythology 
it should nev have been superseded by chnsk 
tianity 

astrology — though the heathen mythcdogy 
completely answers the aristotelian questioi 
yet since this opportunity presents itself i msuf 
introduce it as a second argument but having 
detained you a good while with the preoedingv 
my notice of it shall be very brie£ 

astrology is the oldest science on record if 
we except astronomy even with that it may 
be pronounced coeval for the first use that was 
made of it appears to be the prediction of events 
it was practised m assyria babylonia the 
hindus and egypt and we may say that its 
origin dates from b c when the celes 
tial observations were begun at babylon we 
know that it was extensively cultivated by the 
oreeks and romans as appears from their very 



oid ani new logtc 

jticular accounts of many celebrated profi 
cients in the art of divination nor was its pro 
gress at all impeded by the introduction of chris 
tianity for it was pursuednot only as a regular 
but a most important science everywhere by 
men ardent in their belief of the gospel it was 
scarcely shaken by even newtons discoveries 
and in fact his prmcipia was published full half 
a century before the rejection of astrology be 
came general 

now here is a study dignified with e name 
of science f in the hands of the learned for nearly 
 years that it was their exclusive pro 
vince cannot be denied none could be an as 
trologer without being well versed in whatever 
was known of astronomy at the time and none 
but the learned could have that knowledge we 
cannot date the rejection of astrology by the 
teamed generally speaking earlier than 
for even after that some of them did not disdain 
its study and it was not completely relegated to 
empirics and impudent impostors mud more 
than half a centmy ago perhaps there never 
was a grosser delusion than astrology it was 
liill as ridiculous as the inspection of entrails by 
the greek and roman priests and i now ask 
our aristotelians a second time is the general 
agreement of the learned in any opinion or doc 
trine for any length of time a proof of its sound 
ness they would modiet insinuate that it 
is but if after these two instances to the con

what we designate ignorance 

but all is not yet told those laws were 
passed by a numerous body — the very first 
class of conmionersy chosen as the representa 
tives of a great nation with the concurrence of 
three hundred noblemen whose rank descent 
education and fortune placed them in this in 
stance certainly above any views beyond the 
public good and the monarch gave assent witii 
equal sincerity it cannot be denied that all the 
learning of the country heartily agreed in the 
necessity and wisdom of those laws and they 
were in active operation less than a century and 
a half past for they were not repealed until 
 we are to ke in mind too that simi 
larly wise doings were going on about the same 
time in france and elsewhere on the continent

guinary proceedings we find it to be that ah 
learned intelligent and equitable men bieved in 
the power of a silly old woman to inflict serioo 
injuries on whomsoever she pleased by the 
agency of old nick or of other evil spirits 

after this sample will the aristotdians insi

proof that what they advocate or encourage must

the braying of an ass which no way frightens 
us though it would seem terrible to those who 
hastrd it for the first time we are not now as 
they were formerly our state or condition is 
greatly altered and i must premise that the 
change is entirely owing to bacon some part 
of it may be referred to printing but without 
him that would have been only a feeble assist 
ance in dispelling long established errors he 
first taught us to insist on evidence and that 
struck a deadly blow against general acquies 
cence in delusion this is the reason why your 
wouldbe philosophers are so hostile to him 
they hate him because he opened the eyes pf

them for proofe of their mostprofound speculations 
or assertions the learned all believe it has 
no longer its former weight and is it any wonder 
that they should be incensed against him who 
drove them unceremoniously from their dignified 
monopoly of knowledge and enabled plain men 
to question the infallibility of their decisions 

believe me that you need not from my re 
ceipt conjure up any fears about the difficulty 
of judging aright there seems no likelihood 
whatsoever that the learned can ever again sway

always talking of the republic of letters for 
you will find that expression in very old books 
whereas the truth is that literature was not 
republic properly speaking till the present ceor 
tury nor has it even yet a free constitution 
you may rely on it that the learned can never 
again do the injury that they formerly did to be 
sure they must always have some hobby such as 
craniology which they have been for twentyfive 
years saving to bolster up into a science but 
all will not do though they have changed the 
name to phrenology and enlisted the medical 
world bx their side they cannot now hood 
wink as they used in the good old times 
that means the times of implicit obedience to 
them and which they are constantly extolling 
but alas for them i those times will never again 
return do not you perceive constant sarcasms 
against the march of intellect and the school 
master abroad every blunder of the illiterale 
and every specimen of bad spelling is bcmv 
paraded under those heads but neither this nor 
any other manoeuvre can arrest the spirit of 
vulgar inquiry 

but what greatly i may say effectually 
secures us against the fiightfid deceptions of for

themselves they may be divided into the old 
and new school and these again into two other 
classes or descriptions the first comprises the

us the trouble of thinking by doing that for us 
lemselves the new school comprises those 
who have read or looked into bacon and those 
who have not but who have caught the spirit of 
his scrutinising logic and are prone to ask ex 
planations of what seems unintelligible — a thing 
hated by the old school now between those 
two parties who may be generally regarded as 
aristotelians and baconians in spirit we are 
tolerably safe for if they sometimes prevent by 
their collisions unanimity in a sound doctrine 
tiiere is no chance of that extensive and obedient 
agreement in gross error which formerly pre

great man has clearly traced the causes of all the 
mischief done by what he very fitly designates 
 learned ignorance he shows that ambition 
to rule over the multitude was the grand incen 
tive and that an appearance of superior know 
ledge was the weapon — that men profotmdly 
ignorant themselves overawed the mass by a 
jargon of hard words which they called logic and 
philosophy and that the world would have been 
almost at a stand in real knowledge but for the 
plain and unpretending alluding to what peri 
patetic impostors called learning he says — 

 this learning very little benefits society 
for notwithstanding these learned disputants 
these allknowing doctors it was to the unscho 
lastic statesman that the governments of the 
world owed their peace defence and liberties 
and fiom the illiterate and contemned mechanic 
a name of disgrace that they received the im 
provements of useful arts nevertheless this ar 
tificial ignorance and learned gibbensh prevailed 
mightily in these last ages by the interest and 
artifice of those who found no easier way to that 
pitch of authority and dominion they have at 
tained than by amusing the men of business and 
ignorant with hard words or employing the 
ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about 
unintelligible terms and holding them perpetually 
entangled in that endless labyrinth 

this is but a very trifling extract and i must 
request you to read the whole it is in the 
human understanding book ch and the 
work is now easily procured the chapter is 



old and new logic 

entitled abuse of words it throws a surpris 
ingly clear light on the contrivances of those 
literary cheats who called themselves learned 
and by which they so miserably deluded the unso 
phisticated world if you cannot go through the 
entire let me entreat you to read from section 
to only about eight pages and you will gain 
most valuable information on a subject of the 
highest importance 

as a further proof of what the learned have 
been always doing for our benefit look well to 
the following ominous fact it is taken from 
lockes life in wood£alls edition of his works 
london printed — 

 this work essay on the human under 
standing which has made our authors name 
unmortal and which does honour to our country 
gave great offence to many people at the first 
publication it was proposed at a meeting of 
heads of houses of the university of oxford to 
censure and discourage the reading of it and 
ajqier various debates among themselves it was 
concluded that each head of an house should en 
deavour to prevent its being read in his college 
the reason of this is obvious mr locke let in 
more light upon the minds of men than was con 
sistent with the dark designs of some persons 

what an abominable scheme this we hear 
a great deal about combination among artisans 
though it is only to raise their wages but here 
we have one of the most villanous nature ima 
ginable it was a conspiracy against the spread 
of knowledge — nothing less than high treasofn 



 old and new logic 

against the diffusion of light locke exposed 
the foul designs of learned ignorance and ior 
that he was to be crushed by a vile conspiracy of 
our university teachers happily this base plot 
to murder science did not succeed lockes 
work made so much noise abroad that those pnyi 
fessors who planned its destruction were obliged 
by the force of public opinion to take it iti 
and were reduced to the mortification of endmf 
a mean and cringing request to the author 
correct copies of his invaluable writings what 
a humiliating submission to one who despised 
them locke graduated in oxford and pub 
licly declared his opinion of that seat of learn 
ing thus as recorded in woodfalls edition 
 he often said that what he had learned there 
was of little use to him to enlighten and enlarge 
his mind 

but fw that occurred a long time ago yort 
will perhaps say that such things could not 
be attempted now grieved i am to be of fei 
contrary opinion they are attempted as ftcr 
as is practicable — the same crusade against real 
enlightenment is still maintained why do our 
colleges prefer aristotles trumpery logic of 
words to bacons rational system of reasoning 
because aristotles keeps down sifting inquiry 
while bacons lets in more light upon the 
minds of men than is consistent with the dark 
designs of some persons

some additional remarks con 
cerning the heathen mytho 
logy 

with respect to wliat i have said of the hea 
then mythology i must obsve that it is only 
amall part of what i had designed for a sepa 
rate essay i intended to take a general review 
of that religious system and to prove by imdis 
puted facts that it influenced the notions and the 
conduct of its professors much more powerfully 
and extensively than is commonly supposed 
vary able writers are puzzled how to account 
for some of their proceedings when they recol 
lect their high state of polish and refinement 
those of the greeks in particular were often so 
extraordinary that they appear quite unaccount 
able and to argue a want of even common sense 
they banished or put to death their most vir 
tuous men they rewarded vice and they tried 
and punished their generals and magistrates for 
rendering real services to their country on the 
other hand they sometimes gave noble instances 
of just discrimination and a proper estimation 
of merit — so that they appear in us like a 
community of men who had only certain intervals 
of reason 

sometimes perhaps when they reflected on 
the inmous character of their deities they 
treated them with contempt — anon they became 
afiaid of their vengeance and offered them splen 
did propitiatory sacrifices their greatest men 
were commonly suspected of irreverence to the 






 old and new logic 

gods and lived under continual apprehension 
of prosecution for aristotle himself was obliged 
at the very close of his life to fly his country pre 
cipitately to avoid a process of that kind they 
were collectively taken a mixture of discretion 
and folly justice and injustice deliberation and 
phrensy mercy and cruelty patriotism and ty 
ranny learning and ignorance modesty and ar 
rogance con£idence and superstition moderation 
and intempce prudence and impatience loy 
alty and sedition refinement and barbarity — in 
a word a compound of virtue and vice such as 
seems quite incompatible with that high state of 
civilisation which forces admiration from the 
inost rductant and which enabled a handful of 
men to maintain their liberty against the mightiest 
efforts and to scatter armies whose mere pres 
sure alone seemed sufficient to crush them 

now i intended to trace all these discrepan 
cies to their incoherent religion which left them 
without any fixed guide to distinguish between 
right and wrong but having embodied so much 
of my design in the preceding article i must give 
up all thoughts of a separate essay on the sub 
ject i have not however much to rret on 
that account as i strongly doubt my ability for 
the task it would require tiie penetration and the 
learning of a niehbuhr and i gladly leave it open 
to others who may feel themselves adequate to 
the undertaking but i hope that the lunt may 
not be lost such a work would be very useful 
to correct the erroneous notions not only of 
youth hut of mature age on a subject of great 



old and kbw logic 

hnpertance for while we axe impressed with 
the common notion that none but the lower or 
ders believed in this mythology it is vain to think 
of reading greek and roman history in its true 
light 

as a corollary i intended to institute a 
comparison of christianity with other faiths 
and to show that notwithstanding all the cala 
mities and bloodshed that it has occasioned 
it is the only consistent system of religion and 
the only one that can lead to true morality or 
civilisation this i intended in order to satisfy 
unbelievers or those who think lightly of chris 
tianity even the devil of which sceptics make 
the greatest handle is perfectly consistent and 
quite reconcileable to tiie most latitudinarian 
philosophy that we should be tempted to evil 
is surely quite rational while we are taught that 
the tempter can have no power over us if we put 
our trust in god here is our moral free 
agency fully established — insomuch that the 
toxngest arguments of pedestinarianism are 
but a feeble opposition our god is all powerful 
all justice yet tiie extent of his clemency is incon 
ceivable byus compared with tihis how 
utterly contemptible is the wretched heathen 
mythology where the halfomnipotent jupiter 
though dubbed almighty is constantiy con 
trolled or annoyed by other gods or by lus ter 
magant sisterwife and where he is represented 
as sometimes tampering with the fates in order 
to delay predestined events 

then as to christ i intended to qtn s 

i 



 old and new logic 

ferent arguments and particularly by two which 
appear to be as yet untouched that to believe iii 
his divinity can be no possible humiliation to 
reason and that those who pretend by its denial 
to be the more enlightened evince more incon 
sistency and weakness of intellect than we who 
admit it to the fullest extent such considera 
tions however seemingly extraneo us i deemed 
necessary for elucidating the absurdity of the 
heathen mythology and for exhibiting the folly 
of any attempt to depreciate the doctrines of 
christianity they are the finest code of mora 
lity that can be even imagined by the most fim 
ciful philosopher and they have this strong re 
commendation that they are perfectly practica 
ble if christian nations do not follow them it 
is therefore their own fieiult and it only unhap 
pily proves that we are more inclined towards 
evil than good — to be vicious more than to bfe 
virtuous 

it is too true that the heathen mythology has 
never been reprobated as it deserves our 
admiration of the greeks has kept our reason in 
check do we not suspend our very senses 
when speaking of their poetry and its ctuxste 
 machinery volumes have been written on 
that said machinery and yet soberly examined 
it is a thing of but little merit no great genius 
is required where gods and goddesses of various 
viaws and dispositions are always at hand to 
save a hero firom a deadly blow to interpose a 
mist or unnerve the arm of a powerful antago 
nist we have ourselves ipxiavxc swens 



old and new logic 

of poetry more meritorious than the iliad or 
jeneidy if we consider that we cannot use this 
accommodating machinery and that our lan 
guage is rude compared to the refined state of 
greek or latin no machine of homer or 
virgil has so much merit as a scene in voltaires 
mahomet it is where zaphna is just going to 
kill him when he is suddenly arrested by the 
poison which the wily impostor had secretly 
administered in his food the divine protection 
here seems quite natural tumult subsides into 
reverential awe and tiirious enemies are instantly 
changed into servile adorers the dying zaphna 
himself believes that heaven interposed and yet 
there is nothing marvellous throughout 

but we often read in our classic enthusiasts 
of this beautiful mythology is not such 
thoughtless praise calculated to give us a wrong 
notion of it altogether a heap of absurdities 
despicable by their incongruities revolting by 
their wickedness or disgusting by their inde 
cency — such a mass of deformii i say to be 
represented as beautiful v truly it is high 
time that our youth should be better instructed 
than by instilling into their minds such anti 
christian ideas which like ghoststories told in 
childhood leave an impression too deep to be 
effaced in mature age 

i find that m rollin examines that absurdity 
of paganism which i have treated and the 
inconsistency of the greeks with respect to its 
observance and he comes to the curious conclu 
sion that they had a kind of dowvaj tisi 



 old and new logic 

he says that they were no way conceraed about 
the lives or actions of their gods which they 
freely allowed to be ridiculed in proof f 
this he adduces aristophanes whose plays were 
constantly acted and with great applaus 
though they turned those gods into mockery 
but it was very different with respect to their 
 oracles augin offerings and sacrifices 
these he says were their real religion and any 
contempt or neglect of which they punished 
severely even with death itself as in the case ci 
socrates and others it was by this standard 
he says that they regulated their piety and 
against which they would not suffer any attempt 
whatsoever but there was another religiob 
founded on fable and fictions for which they 
were little concerned and abandoned it entirely 
to the poets to the representations of the 
theatre and common conversation 

now really this looks something like a desire 
to rescue tiie greeks firom the charge of religious 
absurdity for in speaking of their sentence 
against socrates he says — 

 from whence could so evident so univefsal 
and so determinate a contradiction arise amongst 
the athenians a people abounding in other 
respects with wit taste and knowledge must 
without doubt have had their reasons at least 
in appearance for a conduct so different and 
sentiments so opposite to their general charac 
ter 

it is after this that he goes on to explain 
their double religion but i would ask why not 



old ad new logic o 

at once refer such monstrous proceedings to the 
nature of their abominable mythology we 
need nothing else for a sufficient explanation 
could we reasonably expect any consistency 
under a system of piety so vile so revolting 
and detestable no rollin could have 
found a much easier mode of solving what seems 
to him a riddle he had only to suppose a 
ehristian government that allowed christ to be 
ridiculed in common conversation by the 
poets and on the stage and his miracles and 
other attributes to be there held up in derision 
while death awaited those who had not demure 
feces in church or who did not observe the 
duties that our saviour enjoined would not 
he think such a government and such a people 
execrable for their inconsistency i think he 
would and further that he would be at no loss 
to account for any monstrous proceedings 
in their public acts or councils for he was i 
believe a man of sound religion as appears from 
his occasional moral reflections but this anxiety 
to redeem the grecian character inllibly leads 
us to absurdity and it absolutely deprives the 
learned of clear vision is it to our credit that 
we admire the representation of medeas butchery 
of h childri or the horrid feast of atreus no 
doubt we should scout them were they of english 
or french origin but being specimens of grecian 
wit taste and knowledge we only evince our 
classical judgment by intioducing them on our 
stage most of the grecian tragedies have indeed 
little to recommend them but the vq q 

 



 old and new loaic 

language and yet our critics lose themselves 
entirely in admiration of the story but to say 
nothing of an cedipus or such characters lt 
me ask them calmly in some interval of dieir 
transports do they think if a modem were to 
write philoctetes that it would be endured a 
man with an ulcer on his foot emitting a fetid 
stench enough to knock down a horse — poh 
the bare idea is disgusting without faking of 
the wisdom of ulysses which is here both im 
moral and contemptible yet the rev dr 
manwaring who ranks high as a critic calls it 
 a beautifdl drama and praises it so highly 
that one is inclined to think that he regarded 
it as the best of the gredan theatrical pro 
ductions fenelon is so enraptured witii it 
that he makes it the subject of a long episode in 
his telemachus but in order to save the wisdom 
of ulrse from contempt he represents him as 
giving a sign to neoptolemus to restore the 
arrows whue sophocles makes him nesist to 
the last 

let it not be imagined that i wish to tbrow 
the classics aside nothing is rther frcttn my 
thoughts i otily desire thctt they should be 
read with a proper estimation of their merits and 
defects but no one can say a word agateit ihetn 
without being assailed as a barbarian ye hi 
the fece of this malediction i am not afraid 
to ask is not the odyssey taken altogeth a 
most contemptible stoiy there we can mly 
estimate grecian notions of wisdoiii juce 
¦clememcyy and gttieral mwaut it was the 



old axo new logic 

jhtoduction of homers old age when his fire 
liad abated as longinus observes and when he 
perhaps ban to think of making his soul 
and it is on that account the more valuable for 
our purpose to pass the merciless slaughter 
•of te suitors the punishment of the offending 
iiftndmaids is shocking and as for that of melan 
thus it is revolting even to decency it comes 
near to that for hh treason formerly in eng 
land which prolmbly was suggested by t 
classic model the odyssey is altogether an 
outrage to our present ideas of moral conduct 
and cannot but he iiurions to youth who read 
it as a beautiful poem describing the life of the 
wisest of the greeks by which from the conf 
mentaries in praise of him they infer the wisest 
of mankind his conjugal fidelity is an admira 
ble pattern fin some modem husbands though it 
may be right to give their wives hint as they 
iiave all heard of the chaste penelope but are 
generally ignorant of her worthy spouses doings 
in the opposite way it is proper then to inform 
them that the sage ulysses when away from his 
ithful rib freely went to otiier people and 
that to comfort himself for her absice he slept 
•every night during a whole year with circe a 
much younger and handsomer womfm but he 
would kill herself as he did her suitors if he 
found that she had been unchaste let wives 
have an eye to this i say for it is the conjugal 
morality that is taught and praised throughout 
claxsum literature 

the odyssey used not to be tesam c 



 old and mew logic 

on account of its epic inferiority to the iliad 
yet as if tlie dragging of hector round the 
walls of troy were not sufficient to sound the 
praise of ferocity the dublin university not 
long since introduced probably in imitation of 
oxford or cambridge four books of it in 
ordinary and three for honors this makes the 
course of classic morality complete in the 
jeidwehave a picture of roman piety by 
the astute and cautious virgil for he constantly 
calls his hero the pious prince his cavalier 
treatment of dido after a sham marriage his 
heroic indifference on seeing the smoke of her 
funeral pile and his killing tibe suppliant tumus 
to appease the manes of his fiieud pallas are 
 beautiful specimens of both piety and mercy 
even horace himself who is so madly bepraised 
by schoolmen strongly exhibits the barbarian in 
his notions but i cannot now stop to review his 
writings and shall only just mention his brutal 
ode to lycei 
 of what the greeks and romans deemed 
moral and rdigious men we cannot desire a 
more faithfid picture than the odyssey and 
neid yet tlie heathen mythology has found 
innumerable christian excusers or defenders in 
pure zeal for the justification of a peqle who 
had carried poetry learning the fine arts and 
politeness to a surprising extent but why 
attempt to defend what was evidently bad and 
which plainly produced the roost vicious effects 
cannot we admire their language architecture 
jbcuipture or patriotism wthout striving to 



old and new logic 

palliate their senseless proceedmgfs aribjiig from 
a genseiess religioln all school or college 
classics should oe illustrated by english ex 
fanationsy pointing out the gross notions and 
aibburdities of the ancients but there seems to be 
afear that the young students admiration of 
those chaste models might be diminished it 
ii however a very injudicious fear at all 
evenisy i have done my duty in suggesting a 
counteraction to this evil and i shall now show 
how it may be the more easily acconqlihed 

take for example homer and virgil 
instead of running notes which distract the 
attention let each book be preceded by what i 
would call a moral analysis in english in 
which the student should be regularly examined 
tkis would be very little additional labor and 
for its greater difiision in education it should 
also be requiad ki college entrance course 
sy that means it would be spread through the 
schools and the lse notions generated in youth 
fitm an ynguided admiration of the ancients 
would be afitened down to a proper estimation 
in accordance with christianity 

it is vain to defend what is radically bad 
me imprudent friends of lord bacon have 
striven to extetmate his private conduct but 
i never read one ot those attempts not excepting 
even that by the shrewd addison himself which 
did not appear flat and unavailing it is right 
however to observe that bacon cannot be 
accused of defending what is bad he saw no 

beauty in the heathen micaook

learned of his time praised it extravagantlyr 
touching on divinity towards the end of m 
adv of learning he says — 

 and therefore the heathen religion was n 
only a worship of idols but the whole reugiosl 
was an idol in itself for it had no soul that ky 
no certainty of beliet or contession as a maa 
may well think considering the chief dootois tf 
their church were the poets and the reason was 
because the heathen gods were no jealous godsy 
but were glad to be admitted into part as thejf 
had reason neither did they respect the 
pureness of heart so they might have external 
honor and rites 

the marrow of all my arguments onsummed is

shall therefore conclude by once more remon 
strating against our present educational system 
as regards this antimoral mythology it is a 
paramount duty to consider the rising generatteou 
that a change must take place is certain inrt 
are we to let posterity be laughing at out

merit of undeceiving them and not suffer future

just begun my investigation but though not 
strictly speaking a digression i feel that i have 
said too much on what should be a matter of 
sefparate discussion nothing calls more loudly 
for reformation — certainly nothing connected

an entirely new exposition without that edu

and unchristian it cannot be otherwise while 
we train up youth to admire relentless slavery 
of our fellow creature insatiable revenge con 
temptible wisdom revolting cruelty parental 
unfeelingness perverted notions of suicide virtue 
and morality and to crown all a logic opposed 
to probity or philosophical research 

slow progress of bacons logic 

 this is the most painful though a very im 
portant part of our subject after having heard 
and read so much of the years of mental 
slflevery you would think that when bacons 
crganon appeared or shortly ailer aristotles 
syllogistic theory was laid aside i have how 
ever gradually prepared you for the contrary by 
various observations dispersed throughout this 
treatise and i regret that i am now obliged to 
tell you plainly that greater efforts than ever are 
making to throw bacon aside 

and by whom are those efforts making by 
antiquated dunces you will guess whose exer 
tions can signify nothing in these enlightened 
times no but it is by the earuedl ytjaow k 



 ojud and new logic 

that the colleges of oxford cambridge dublin 
and in short ell our great universitiesy have been 
for many years pas sedulously endeavouring u 
bring bacons admirable system of induction into 
disrepute and that they have at length dirowir 
off the mask and openly declare that it is not 
logic at all nor in any way coaeemed with the 
art of reasoning this indeed is what they have 
been doing for the last two centuries for all 
their books of instruction on logic have eith 
passed it by entirely like those by walk and 
others or have mentioned it contemptuously 
as a thing almost beneath notice but the hi 
encomiums bestowed on it by men of liberal 
minds and unquestionable erudition in various 
publications of the first respectability particularly 
during the last twenty years having made a 
deep impression the colleges those sfrongholdg 
of old doctrines wheth er right or wrong have 
been torced to notice it and that is by pro 
nouncing it to be out of the province of logic 
trinity college dublin will do as well ae any 
other to explain this for it takes its tone from 
the mother country and there is not mudi 
difference in its general routine from the english 
and scotch imiversities in when ccm 
siderable changes were contemplated there wa 
a kind of temporary suspension of logic and a 
rumor prevailed that it would be no longer 
taught on the old plan and that bacon would 
be substituted the next year however saw 
murrays logic brought in with the addition of 
wbatelys — and the ancietit syllostic system 



old and new logia 

eo justly condemned by the voice of truth and 
vason is now firmly established as being the 
best for instructing the rising generation it is 
true that a small portion of bacon was then for 
the first time admitted ¦ but special care was 
taken to exclude even that fractional part from 
e general course — it being solely reserved for 
e few who read for moderatorships yet the 
iublin university is held to be more liberal 
than that of cambridge and fax before oxford 
in point of enlarged views 

there is no necessity to say any thing of old 
murray his work is like all other college 
books on logic completely aristotelic but that 
of dr whately now archbishop of dublin 
being one of the latest and in great university 
estimation is of too much importance to be 
passed without observation his graces book 
consists of pages including a great deal of 
small print and how much do you think is 
devoted to induction only jt pages he 
would evidently like his predecessors have left 
it unnoticed only for the noise that it has latterly 
made read now what he says he is 
adverting to the inaccuracy of writers on induction 
and the syllogism — 

this inaccuracy seems chiefly to have 
arisen from a vagueness in the use of the word 
induction which is sometimes employed to 
designate the process of investigation and of 
collecting facts sometimes the deducing of an 
inference yrom those £a£ts the former of these 
processes viz that of obecvaiiotv w i 

k 



 old and new logic 

periment is undoubtedly distinct from that which 
takes place in the syllogism but then it is not a 
process of argument the latter again is an 
argumentative process but then it is like all 
other arguments capable os being syllogisticajuy 
expressed 

observe how strenuously his grace labors to 
depreciate induction he admits that one part 
of it is an argumentative process and surely 
that is a wonderful admission from a college 
logician but then as it is capable of being 
syllogistically expressed he speaks as though 
it were hardly worth notice in comparison to the 
syllogism with which his book is for the most 
part occupied 

his grace says that it is a fallacy to call 
induction a distinct kind of argument from the 
syllogism and further — 

 induction thefore so far forth quatenus 
— how beautifully logical as it is an argianenty 
may of course be stated syllogistically but so 
far forth as it is a process of inquiry with a view 
to obtain the premises of that argument it is of 
course out of the province of logic 

you see how industriously he works to dis 
connect induction from logic and at last he 
drives it by clapping his shoulders manfully 
to the wheel entirely out of the province 
altogether but afrer slightly adverting to the 
nature of the inductive process he says that it is 

 a process by which we gain properly new 
truths and which is not connected with logic 
beii not what is btrct cdiw keaiontng but 
investicfation 



old and n£w looic 

admirable so then a process by which we 
gain new truths has nothing to do with logic 
would you now think that dr whately was 
really serious or would not you rather imagine 
that he had made an unlucky slip in his warmth 
against induction why this is an entirely new 
description of lc all our peripatetics used 
to admit and even dr watts whose aristo 
telianism it would be cruel to doubt admits 
logic to be the pursuit and acquisition of 
truth but as new ttu is not mentioned there 
may be a great difference between old and new 
truths in the estimation of dr whately we 
have it however very particulaiiy assted by 
him that logic has nothing to do with the 
gainii of new truths does he mean that 
induction discovers new truths and logic old lost 
ones we can hardly suppbsethat ff it 
woulcl be making almost a caricature of logic 
does he mean then that logic has nothing to do 
with the discovery of truth that is what he 
means for he inveighs against the common 
error in calling logic a means for the discovery 
of truth and he takes no small pains to represent 
it as only a process of argumait now that is 
reducing it to a very humble rank since it then 
becomes nothing more than a weapon widi 
which by skilful management you may defeat 
an adversary or at least give him no vantage 
ground by this he pays the highest possible 
compliment to induction though we are certainly 
under no obligation to him for itany one can 
see that it came out in his qxcebvn nsckfiscvkv 
for the syllogism 



 old and new logic 

logic that is syuostic logic is ten 
according even to dr whately only an ar 
gumentative or otherwise a disputative process 
while induction is one that discovers truth 
consider that well logic will enable you to 
conduct an argument but it does not pretend to 
discover truth — if you aspire to that you must 
have recourse to induction think well on that 
also for i assure you that it is very important 
coming as it does through dr whately but 
then he says that induction is not what is 
strictly called reasoning but investigation 
he thus teaches that induction which he admits 
develops truth is not reasoning i e that 
reasoning is not necessary for its development 
or to prevent any caviulng about words for 
its discovery did you ever think before that 
the discovery of truth was so simple as to 
require no reasoning philosophers have been 
since the earliest ages of literature striving to 
discover it and so difficult did this appear that 
many in complete despair made up their minds 
that there was no snch thing what pity that 
they did not know induction but college 
logicians will tell us that it was always known 
why so it was just as the syllogism was known 
before aristotle though he claims and very 
justly the invention since it was lying nearly 
useless like iron in the mine till he developed 
ite use in the same manner mduction was 
unknown witii ref erence to its value till bacon 
unfolded its great powers and showed it to be 
the only engine save cliatice bvoive caile of 



old and new logic 

dislodging truth from concealment the at 
tempts to depreciate induction by covertly 
robbing bacon of its invention are contemptible 
— they exhibit only a disposition not a power 
to inflict wanton injmy aristotle might be 
more feirly deprived of the syllogism for it was 
actually used by other logicians before he 
published his celebrated analysis but would not 
one evince great folly in decrjring it on the 
grounds that it was not aristotles invention 

but dr whatelys assertion calls for still a 
more strict examination he says that in 
duction will discover truth though it is not 
reasoning now a regular process that seeks 
from the beginning to discover some truth and 
that ultimatdy succeeds must include reasoning 
for induction is not the accumulation of cts and 
instances throwing of them into a heap and 
then saying there contradict them if you can 
it requires a great exercise of both the reason 
and judgment simple as it appears it cannot 
be used effectively without following bacons 
rules implicitly and they are sufficiently exten 
sive to demand a profound and laborious study 

dr whatelys description of induction seems 
to be upon the whole fairly entitled to be called 
a paradox but suppose we take it in its strict 
meaning that induction is no use in argument — 
even there no one need be afrtdd to meet him 
he has told us too plainly to be mistaken that 
induction has no chance in contention with a 
syllogistic opponent where argument is con 
cerned and i think that vie vr £lca ss£

insist that the wlwle sacred volume should be 
put into the hands of every child who can read 
without the least restriction as to any part for

assail them with is it not the word of god 
and can you deny that it is all the word of 
god being answered with a yes and no 
they then cry can the word of god teach any 
thing improper having got their answer 
no they then come down with their ergo it

since they are already w known and it is 

sufficient to say that they chiefly occur in the 

books of moses as i do not wish to hurt any 

ones feelings unnecessarily i was going to 

recall the word improper and to substitute 

ttseless or uninstructivey but i now find that i 

cahnot children are always curious it is 

quite natural that they should be so when reason 

is only budding when they meet certain 

words or sentences that they cannot understand 

they ask for an explanation which any father or 

mother would uush to give is it pr op er or 

improper to put such passages into their hands 

ihey are first told that the biwe is the word ot 

god and that it can contain nothing but what is 

good yet when they ask for an ducidation of 

some parts parents are under the necessity of 

either giving them a false version or checking 

them for impertinent curiosity which is virtually 

telling them that it is not proper for them to 

know the meaning 

 every one admits that the jews have been 

always singularly exact with respect to the old 

testament so tenacious were they of its 

purity and so anxious to preserve the text 

from any the slightest corruption or innovation 

that they counted not only the words but the 

letters compomng the entire this would argue 

that they regarded the minutest portion as of the 

highest importance yet there were some parts 

which they would not allow of being read by any 

of the male sex before thirty and by females

afraid of what why of conveniencing cul 
their readers only a few have ventured to 
adopt my suggestion which has given great 
satisfeiction and i have no doubt that it wiu yet 
be universally followed though not probably till 
the present generation has passed away — unless 
indeed that the colleges should sanction it and 
then all ear would quickly vanish 

but you will naturally ask why do all those 
learned men who write logical treatises 
advocate the syllogistic theory because they 
all write with a view to their adoption by the 
colleges for they are read no where else if 
tlie author be a man in humble or middling 
circumstsdnces that is a fortune to him and for 
one to whom any profit on the sale of his book 
would not be an object there is that great 
incentive fame there can hardly be a higher 
gratification to a literary man than to have his 
work entered in a college course it must be 
felt to be conceived and it has sometimes 
induced men to write against their own prin 
ciples and conviction indeed it has sometimes 
affected tiie reason — an instance of which i 
could menfionbut i siqpress any account 
because it might give pain to the friends of the

you may ask too why so few eminent authors 

lve written against the syllogistic theor 

 the reason for this is twofold — tliey regard it as 

hopeless on account of the public apathy on sudb

fktcasions and they do not choose to attract a 
warm of hornets about their ears no great 
writer ever yet exposed the inanity of syogistic 
reasoning without being tormented by its buzzing 
defenders great writers have always an 
extensive acquaintance with the heads of 
colleges who are all professed aristotelians 
and tiiey do not like to cend them which they 
undoubtedly would if they wrote against what 
is taught by them they content themselves 
therefore by secretly despising it and following 
bacon in reality as their guide few have the 
courage to encounter this hostoity like a locke 
a kaims a campbell or a stewart and fewer 
still have the manliness of dr reid who 
though an ardent admirer of aristotle exhibited 
a rare example of integrity by combating his 
own prejudices but let the colleges once 
declare for bacon and we should then be 
astonished at the number of able writers who 
would break through their speotatorial silence 
openly proclaim their sentiments and denounce 
syllogistic logic as a waste of time a grave 
delusion an empirical farce an impudent cheat 
a literary bugbear — in one word a humbug 

yes we should then be astonished and so 
would dr whately himself at the number of 
able opponents of syllogistic logic convenient 
opportunity alone is wanted nor can our 
really great men bear the thoughts of teaching 
this degrading and equivocative system as we 
see in the instance of dr adam smith author 
rf the cdebrated weauh of nations lu 



 old and new logic 

he was elected professor of logic in tlie 
imiveraty of glasgow and the year fouowmg 
he was removed to the professorship of moral 
philosophy in which situation he continued 
thirteen years but why was he removed 
because he could not bring himself in justice to 
reason to teach a system that distorted 
reasoning this is fiainly seen in the following 
which was written by one of his pupils and 
which dugald stewart gives verbatim in his 
life of smiifli — 

 in theprofessorship of logic to which mr 
smith was appointed on his first introduction 
into this university he soon saw the necessity of 
darting widely from ihe plan that had been 
followed by his predecessors and of directing 
the attention of his pupils to studies of a more 
interesting and useful nature than the logic and 
metaphysics of the schools accordingly after 
exhibiting a general view of the powers of the 
mind and explaining so much of the ancient 
logic as was requisite to gratify ciuriosity with 
respect to an artificial method of reasonii 
which had once occupied the universal attention 
of the learned he dedicated all the rest of his 
time to the djelivery of a system of rhetoric and 
belles lettres 

here we see plainly the cause of his quick 
removal from the chair of logic it was not for 
want of the requisite knowledge for he had 
studied the ancient logic deeply and metaphysics 
too as is shown in his writings on those subjects 
tlie fact is that as an honest man he would 



old and new looflc 

not teacb sucb a minddebasing thing as syllo 
gistic logic and accordingly he was removed 
to make way for those of a more pliant and 
unscrupulous spirit 

it is proper here to remark that dr smith 
was a philosopher of very enlarged understanding 
he wrote several works evincing a profoimd 
acquaintance with classic literature and his 
wealth of nations has been translated into all 
modem languages although the first it is still 
the best treatise on politiced economy though 
subseiquent writers on the subject endeavour 
to depreciate him by industriously pointing out 
some errors into which he was led naore tijough 
want of instances to akl him than of judgmgit 
time having furnished those proofe tiiey affect 
to despise dieir great master and yet though 
they have the assistance of sixty years additional 
experience and which particularly the last five 
and twenty or thirty include the most enter 
prising commercial periods ever known their 
speculations are for the most part either 
visionary or too hasardous for practice they 
seem to forget entirely that there are very few 
perhaps not more than half a dozen fixed 
principles in political economy — that the peculiar 
circumstances of a country and its people call for 
different views — that what would suit one nation 
will not another and that even in the same 
country what would be highly beneficial at one 
time must be extremely hurj at another period 
according as she advances or retrogrades in 
power or influence but they are blinds v 



ig old and new logie 

the ambition of being philosophers and they 
scorn at any thing but generalization they 
aim at showing their amazing profundity by 
laying down rules applicable to all and they 
and their books go regularly down together into 
the common guh of oblivion 

i do maintain what i said elsewhere to which 
i cannot now conveniently refer that the syllo 
gism is hx inferior as an argumentatire engine 
to induction and further that it is inferior as a 
process of reasoning even fully admitting dr 
whatelys distinction between reason and 
 reasoning it is incumbent on me to be very 
plain for every one must confess that his grace 
is remarkably candid in that respect he differ 
widely from his predecessors who in many in 
stances seem to imitate the obscurity of their great 
peripatetic master but dr whately is every 
where dear intelligible and decided and never 
uses ambiguous words or phrases from which 
two meanings might be drawn but boldly 
declares his sentiments in perspicuous languager 
i say then that the syllogism is an indifferent 
process of reasoning compared to induction 
which he describes as being only investigation 
it appears to me however that he is somewhat 
too metaphysical in his description of logic if 
it do not pretend to discover truth may we not 
ask of what use is it in reasoning any 
process of reasoning describe it as we may has 
for its object the detection of error and that is 
virtually the deelopment of truth what is 
ali attempt to obtain ihe itemises of au argu 



old ad nkw logic 

meut but an attempt to discover whether they 
are or are not fiallacious though he will not 
allow it to have any pretensions to discovery 
neither in short every inquiring process 
must inevitably have truth for its object for 
even the mechanical process of common arith 
metic seeks to find the true amoimt or required 
distinctions of multifarions quantities 

the less complicated any system is so much 
the better and for this reason i am rather 
unwilling to separate induction from inves 
tigation yet there seems to be a difference 
tt deserves notice an argument syllo 
gistically based might be overturned by pure 
investigation alone ie without bringmg 
forward a single ct or instance but that is 
only as the case may be for fskcts and instances 
will be sometimes indispensable here it is 
that the syllogist has an advantage when 
they are necessary and when time will not 
allow us to supply them he may maintain an 
absurd doctrine with the most plausible 
appearance of victory appearance indeed 
for what sort of victmy is it nothing more 
than the triumph of clacanery your syllogist 
is a noexcptkm man who rests pertinaciously 
on his dogmas till they are scattered by the 
searching process of induction for as far as 
my observatioq has gone i never knew a 
syllogist to defeat in argument any one who 
came properly prepared to meet him by induction 
i do contend that the sylfogin is an 
unmanly weapon admitting that w ni t

knavish opponent are we to oppose him bjr 
knavery lawyers well know and we all 
know that a dishonest witness will break 
down on an able crossexamination and what 
is that but a process of combined investigation 
and induction we must certainly agree with 
dr whately when he asserts that logic by 
which he implies the syllogistic theory is not a 
method for the discovery of truth 

you may now begin to perceive why bacons 
logic has been retarded it is too plain no 
show no ornaments no gaudy trappings it is 
downright reasoning — a real exercise of the 
understanding only think how learned two 
ltlemen appear when discussing whether a 
syllogism is in ihe figure of barbara or cesare 
or whether again it may not belong to the mode 
celarent or festino why it is enough to 
 dazzle the crowd and set them all agape 
when we simple folk hear them we are awed 
into respectful admiration and we think that 
they are initiated into profoimd mysteries which 
demand superior intellect to comprehend can 
you wonder when you consider the extent of 
human vanity that they fear the being placed 
on a level with us and that they consequently 
hate induction because we can at least under 
stand what it means while on the contrary 
coue logic is so hard to be understood that 
only a few choice spirits ever become adepts in 
its mysterious secrets of this dr whately 
himself bears testimony speaking of oxford he 
says —

old and new logic 

¦ the truth is that a very email roportiony 
ven of distinguished students ever become 
proncients in ltogic and that by far the greater 
part pass through the university without knowing 
any thing at all of the subject i do not mean 
that they have not learned by rote a string of 
technical terms but that they understand ab 
solutely nothing of the principles of the science 

what a force then is this logic there are 
generally eay about students at oxford 
and there must be amongst so many a number 
of bright youths every one of them learns 
logic and yet all but a mere fraction complete 
their studies without knowing any tiling at all 
of the subject and this is exactly the case 
at all our other universities 

but notwithstanding this formidable hostility 
for it is useless to deny that it is formidable i 
have great pleasure in acquainting you that 
bacons logic is silently malung way and that 
the day seems not for distant when in spite of 
university opposition all sensible and really 
learned men will be ashamed to advocate the 
delusive and worse than all the dishonesty sys 
tem of aristotle there has evidently been 
alarm in the camp for some years past what 
else produced dr whatelys novel declaration 
that logic did not pretend to discover truth 
 ne fact is that people were constantly asking 
what it did and nothing could be shown while 
the amazing success of the baconian method 
is such that to point out its results would be 
as is observed in the ldbrary of useful know 
ledge to give nothing lees than the history of 



 old and new logic 

science for the last two hundred years to 
fjuence such impertinent inquiries dr whately 
therefore makes the curious discovery that all 
his brother logicians have been wrong in repre 
senting the syllogistic theory as a method fr 
finding out truth do not you see the important 
object of this it was to put down those 
annoying inquiries by announcing that logic 
was only a process of reasoning but that as i 
have already explained is a very poor answer 
and will not prevent forther inquiries concerning 
the utility of this truthdisclaiming process 
beyond a doubt its use appears no where but 
in treatises on its use its very advocates make 
bo use of it now when discussing other matters 
and as for the sciences it has been long since 
discarded from them— experience having amply 
proved that it wofuuy retarded their advance 
ment 

this theory of uselessness is manifestly touch 
ing on its last days we may consider the 
confession of having nothing to do with truth as 
its expiring speecl though no doubt it will 
like the ninelived cat struggle long for 
existence dr whately laments that several 
experiments tried at oxford have not contributed 
towards its resuscitation amongst these was 
the requiring of its study to be indispensable 
for testimonials or a sort of inferior honors but 
that did nothing for the professors found that 
if they proceeded to real examinations testimo 
nials would indeed be rarities you will probably 
stare at this word realy for i suppose that you 



old and n£w logic 

like others who do not trouble themselves much 
about what colleges are doing believe that all 
their examinations are real i must therefore 
let you into a secret you must know then 
that there is a particular exception with regard 
to logic for that the examinations are only 
pro formay or a matter of form the studait 
answers only according to wlmt he happens to 
recollect aiul even where his answers are all 
wrong or where he gives none at all this does 
not in any way affect his advancement in the 
other sciences or in classics if he do not answer 
correctly he loses his examination as it is 
called which is not only a great mortification 
but a disgrace he is ius put three or four 
months back and if he be not well prepared 
at the next trial he is again remanded and so 
on till he answer satisfectorily but experience 
proved that strict examinations in syllctic 
mysteries would dispeople the colleges and the 
farce of fictitious ones was of necessity per 
mitted 

another experiment was to encourage the 
voluntary study of this hateful logic by a 
statute of candidates for testimonials 
were allowed their chmce of substituting logic 
fw a portion of euclid this appeared to be 
most flattering in twentyfive presented 
for euclid and one hundred for logic the 
worthy directors of oxford ware in transports of 
joy but alas their triumph was shortlived it 
was found that the candidates preferred logic 
because that was only a gettingoffbyheart 



 old and new logic 

affair whereas euclid required serious study 
the professors thought that they might in this 
case exact real examinations as the adoption 
of logic was left optional but they found that 
it would be imprudent though dr whately 
seems to thmk that nothing else will revive this 
half dead science 

parents may see here how the college time of 
their sons for which they pay so dearly is 
wasted they are all obliged to study or rather 
to read logic which consumes many months 
uselessly and as if that were not bad enough 
those who aspire to testimonials are now per 
mitted to use between ekiclid and this bubble 
such are college improvements is not this 
highly reprehensible mathematics are univer 
sally acknowledged to be of the greatest utility 
and yet this phantom of logic diat eludes the 
grasp and flits away like an ignis tuus 
gets greater encouragement agam j remind 
parents whose sons have the laudable ambition 
to obtain university rank not to overlook those 
considerations 

pro forma examinations are injurious to edu 
cation and should be left to their proper sphere 
the nobility perhaps you do not imow that a 
noblemans son who is styled in college aihus 
nohilisf is entitled to pass his examinations as a 
matter of course the origin of this was pro

wuvenity and therefore every filius nobilis can

of b a as a thing of rights whether he merit 
it or not some of them turn out notwith 
standingy to be excellent bcholars for i believe 
that their fimhers can if they please insist on 
real examinations but this does not at all 
concern us and i therefore proceed to what 
does which is logic suppose that our college 
jshould determine on bona fide examinations in 
it what would be the consequences why that 
instead of four years five six or seven would 
be requisite or the young men would be so 
harrassed that their health must suffer or tho 
strictness of examination in their other studies 
must be lessened or they would be so dis 
gusted that they would lose a relish altogether 
ior study and learn little or nothing some 
persons can nevar be brought to know the differ 
ence between youths and childri a child 
may be forced to learn reading writing and 
even conunon arithmetic but it is futile to think 
of forcing young men to learn what they detest 
what they feel that they can never understand 
and what they are satisfied if they did under 
standy could be no accession of knowledge 

i much regret to see dr whately strongly 
inclined to the farcing plan he says that logic 
would rise in estimation and be studied with 
real profit if it were made optional to those 
who are merely candidates for a degree but 
indispensable for the attainment of honors 
the examination might then he thinks be a 
strict one without any reasonable objecticm 
indeed why what is it thjt bi ft a

and all other distmctionsy but the voluntary as 
piration to honors it is that which causes a 
noble emulation and is confessedly one of the 
wisest devices for the encouragement of study 
or the advancement of education but if the 
whatelyan bar be thrown across the path to 
honors we shall find fw who will aim at them 
for their attainment is aheady sufficiently diffi 
cult and any additional obstacle would operate 
as almost a prohibition i must inform you that 
honors are £ar before testimonials which are 
only like an admowledgment of superior an 
swering in the usual presoribed course whereas 
honors are given for the voluntary prosecution 
of extra studies they are therefore a great 
incentive to learning and it would be both un 
wise and cruel to put any impediment in the way 
of such a laudable source of emulation

been rejected there we invariably see the good

the same course some deviations have indeed

 olo and new logic 

there ianow a bona fide overwhelmmg majority 
tot it by this i mean when we include thom 
whoy for reasons already stated say nothing 
against the syllogistic theory 

thoughts on a new system of 

logic 

what i mean by a new system is only a new 
arrangement it seems futile to aittempt any 
novelty in logic having at last after a search 
of prodigious length lighted on what appears 
to be the only rational method there we must 
rest 

but while men have been for ages striving 
to explain a theory more injurious by for than 
useful no one has yet illustrated bacon this 
is the chief thing necessary and whoever does 
it first will earn great honor for himself and 
render an important service to the world we 
can hardly blame the author for leaving that to 
others nothing is so disheartening as to know 
that we are writmg for remote generations and 
i think we should rather wonder how lord 
bacon had the courage to be so minute in his 
details his organon mill not however be 
studied as it deserves till it be digested by e 
amples i find that dr reid has considered 
this with his usual fairness and judgment — 

 most arts have been reduced to rules after 

they had been brought to a considerable degree 

of perfection by the natural sagacity of artists 

ond the rules have been duavm om the best 



old and new logic 

examples of the art that had bei before ex 
hibited but the art of philosophical induction 
was delineated by lord bacon in a very ample 
manner before the world had seen any tolerable 
examples of it 
 those remarks are strikingly impartial and 
make us see the value of bacon in a new light 
but he continues — 

 this though it adds greatly to the merit of 
the author must have produced some obsemrity 
in the work and a defect of proper examples 
for illustration this defect may now be easily 
supplied from those authors who in their philo 
sophical disquisitions have most strictly pursued 
the path pointed out in the novum organum 

yes it may indeed be easily supplied but 
though dr reid wrote that about seventy years 
ago no one has yet done it while the syllogistic 
bubble has had scores of expounders and editors 
in that time 

he who undertakes this great desideratum 
and i know of nothing in literature more wanted 
need give himself no uneasiness about the extent 
of his work it must necessarily be too bulky 
for the purpose of ordinary tuition but thai it 
will serve as a great store or magazine whence 
he or others may draw materials tor school books 
or minor compendiums while it will itself be a 
treasury of knowledge for the studious who 
wish to explore the genuine sources of reasoning 
and information there is no use in concealing 
that it would be a most laborious undertaking — 
so laborious indeed that we cowvivox t

pendt of them dr reid at once saw their 
great worth and though engaged specially 
upon aristotle he says — 

 i think lord baccm was also the first who 
endeavoured to reduce to a system the prudices 
or biasses of the mind whichare the causes of 
felse judgment and which he calls the idols of 
tlie human understanding some late writar 
of logic have very properly introduced this into 
their system but it deserves to be more copi 
ously handled and to be illustrated by real 
examples 

the opinion of a reid who so nobly con 
quere d his o wn preju dices is surdiy ititled to 
the bluest respect yet what are we to think 
of dr whatelys sapience in taking no notice 
whatsoever of the idols i have looked through 
his book for the purpose and i think that i am 
not mistaken in saying that he has not oxk

mentioned them is this commendable in a 
christian clergyman when instructing youth in 
the art of reasoning 

it may not be amiss to say something about 
 real examples illustration does not require 
that they should be real for supposed or invented 
ones will answer as wdl and dr lieid probably 
thought so tooi bnt if he did mean the word 
in its strict sense it shows the value of the 
baconian system very forcibly when he thought 
that instances enough could be easily collected 
in his own time and there is certainly a vast 
addition since both for induction and the idols 

my first design was to confine myself to the 
idols and induction and to recommend their 
substitution fir the syllogistic theory i intended 
not to meddle witib any departments of prepare 
tory initiation and to leave them open for any 
one to draw as he pleased fiom aristotle but 
oh considering bacon more attentively i feel 
that he contains nearly every thing necessary to 
form a logician what need is there for a pro 
longed dissertation on definitions if we study 
his further remarks preparatory to the induc 
tive method which embrace the substance of 
definition especially if some additions were 
made which time and circumstances may have 
rendered necessary there is surely no occa 
sion for an appalling exhibition of ideas sub 
stances categories propositions and other things 
equally embarrassing to the young student when 
the first part of tte novum organon is fiom 
beginning to end a series of plain rules for the

notions our powers our judgments and in short 
for all the operations of the mind indeed dr 
whately himself complains that a great deal 
of irrelevant matters are brought into logical 
treatises and be accordingly after a few pre 
liminaries goes suddenly into the syuogism 
but that is perhaps only stepping from one ex 
treme to another both the syllogistic and 
inductive theories seem to require some initiatory 

separation definition is surely necessary for 
aeon himself who thought very little about the 
schoolmens rules when spealang of it says 
 for it cometh to pass for want of this that 
we are sure to end there where we ought to have 
begun which is in questions and differences 
about words udv of leamingy book 

to illustrate babon properly he must be 
rewritten no great system can be composed 
in what we may call a teacjiable order lliat 
must be the work of others whose minds are 
not weighed down by the pressure of respon 
sibility and invention besides there is in the 
present case a particular consideration of 
another nature bacon is now one of our old 
authors and upwards of two centuries would go 
near to antiquate any spoken tongue but along 
with that he had a most reprehensible fancy for 
 uncouth phraselogy and comparisons beneath 
his genius and he appears to have little tasie

what is vulgarly called qveer and the necessity 
for a general remodelling is obvious it is 
curious how some great geniuses are tormented 
by this fancied inadequacy of present language 
spencer was so fond of old words that his fairy 
queen is almost as hard to be read as chaucer 
and lord byron was so enamoured of them 
that he sends us constantly to baileys dictionary 
¦ but the most remarkable mstanc e is j eremy 
bentham lliat profound logician for surely 
there never was one if he is to be excluded from 
the list had no paltry desire for singularity of 
expression but he imagined our modem english 
insufficient for the precision of his views and 
lelt himself forced to com some of the most 
barbarous and unpronounceable words ever 
fabricated by man nay even with tibis aid he 
was ometimee absolutely driren to french for 

the utterance of his conceptions but what an 

unwarrantable digression am not i making 
lest it might however be supposed as an 
apology for bacon must now say that i 
regard his harsh style as not only inexcusable 
but reproachful to his learning i have been 
sometimes inclined to look on this foible as a 
kind of superstition in the case of great men 
for conceited pedante are not worth notice a

that ordinary language will not express his

more about the iqustraaiod of bacon though i 
oould wish to oser some further hints i dball 
however strengthen my proposal by some other 
quotations from dr reid — 

 although e art of catorical syllogism jg 
better fitted for scholastic litigation than for 
real improvement in knowledge it is a voierable 
piece of antiquity and a great effort of ha 
gemus we adnme the pyramids of bigypty 
and the wall of china though useless burdens 
iqon the earth 

when this is all that can be urged for the 
syllogistic theory and that by an admirer of its 
founder i ask should not we hasten even at the 
eleventh hour to illustrate bacon here now 
is another reason — 

 after men had labored in the search of 
truth near two thousand years liord bacon 
proposed the method of induction as a more 
effectual engine for that purpose his novum 
organum gave a new turn to the thoughts and 
labors of the inquisitive more remarkable and 
more useful than that which the organum of 
aristotie had given before and may be con 
sidered as a second grand sera in the progress 
of human reason 

pray observe the words more useful 
pseudophilosophers may in the arrogance of 
pragmatic conceit smile at utility while every 
one else believes that anything more useful 
than another is to be preferred the following 
is a further reference to the utility of induction — 
 the art of syllogism pioduced numberless 



old and new logic s 

disputes and numberless sects who fought 
against each other with much animosity 
without gaining or losing ground but did 
nothing considerable for the benefit of human 
life the art of induction first delineated by 
lord bacon produced numberless laboratories 
and observatories in which nature has been 
put to the question by thousands of experiments 
and forced to confess many of her secrets which 
before were hid from mortals and by these 
arts have been improved and human knowledge 
wonderfully increased 

oh but all that is nothing in the estimatioa 
of a whately induction is only investigation 
not a process of reasoning and our youth 
are therore to be instructed in the syllogistic 
art which teaches them how to dispute wiout 
gaining or losing ground to benefit human 
life is only a vulgar consideration and to 
improve hman knowledge has no concern with 
his logic 

the £dllawing comes however more home to 
dr whatelys particular v iews — 

in reasoni by syllogism from general 
principles we descend to a conclusion vutually 
contained in them the process of induction is 
more arduous being an ascent from particular 
premises to a general conclusion the evidence 
of such general conclusions is not demonstrative 
but probable but when the induction is 
sufficiently copious and carried on according to 
the rules of art it forces conviction no less than 
demonstration itself does 



 



 old and new logic 

after this are we to pin our feitb to dr 
whatelys sleeve and to believe with him that 
induction is no process of reasoning why 
what is reasoning at all if it be not what is her 
described he may enigmatise about in 
duction not obtaining the premises of an 
argument but if it force conviction it is 
something very like logic though he would keep 
it outside the pale it is quite futile any longer 
to trifle about the universal applicability of 
induction there is no department of logie 
which it cannot meet and it can besides 
discover truth which according to dr whately 
syllogistic logic cannot or at least do not 

alluding to induction which distinguishes 
first principles taken for granted fiom pro 
positions that require proof and to the necessity 
of separating them by a distinct line dr reid 
says — 

this has been done in mathematics fiom 
the beginning and has tended greatly to the 
emolument of that science it has lately been 
done in natural philosophy and by this means 
that science has advanced more in an hundred 
and fifty years than it had done before in two 
thousand every science is in an unformed 
state until its first principles are ascertained 
after that is done it advances regularly arid 
secures the ground it has gained 

is not this great encouragement to prosecute 

the study of induction in preference to that 

of the syllogistic stalkinghorse or as lord 

kaims calls it the enciwve ce oc syllo 



old and new logic 

gibiny whre empty phantonm pass for realities 
but dr reid las summed up as it were the 
inestimable character of bacons system in the 
following when speaking generally of the 
novum organon — 

 those who understand it and enter into 
the spirit of it will be able to distinguish the 
chaff from the wheat in philoschical disquisitions 
into the works of god they will learn to hold 
in due contempt all hypotheses and theories the 
creatures of human imagination and to respect 
nothing but facts sufficiently vouceed or cop 
elusions drawn trom them by a tau d chaste 
interpretation of natura 

this is cheering encouragement for the 
illustration of bacon from tibis we learn that 
his organon developes the means or process of 
obtaining all the knowledge that is of anyvaluelj 
and of separating delusion from attainable 
informationt there can be little doubt that 
such a work as i propose would pay for the 
labor bestowed its sale must daily increase 
for the public mind is now fully prepared to 
throw off in good earnest the fetters of 
aristoue the very colleges seem weary of a 
useless opposition to general opinion they 
have in feet offered terms of capitulation by 
admitting a scrap of bacon and we can plainly 
perceive that were he presented in a regularly 
teachable form they feel that they must 
surrender imconditionally it is evident that 
they wish to compromise there are some 
 signs of the times that cannot be toiaksscu 



s old and new logic 

one of tliem is the whatelyan dibcoveries that 
induction is not reasoning and that it is out 
of the province of logic and another is that 
which may be called a sop in the pan of 
allowing bacon to come at all within the gates 
time was when he would be fired at even 
though he came with a flag of truce dr 
vvhately complains that the scotch colleges 
have admitted part of his organon into their 
courses which he seems to regard as an in 
consistent mixture with the syllogistic theory 
but he will ere long have the same complaint 
to make against his dear oxford and cambridge 
too dublin as i have already observed has 
followed the scotch example fimd admits one 
book of the augro scient with the prefeces to 
the inst mag and nov org but this is 
however only for moderatorships and entirely 
out of the general course we may here 
wonder that bacons latin is permitted when 
we have his original english at least in the 
augmentis scientiarum for surely such latin is 
no better than monkish against which our 
college folk have such an antipathy 

having fallen in perhaps unfairly with the 
general censure of bacons uncouth phraseo 

llogy justice requires me to observe that it 
chiefly appears in his philosophical workst his 
new atlantis is even an excellent specimen of 
the narrative style it is easy smooth and 
flowing and making due allowmices for the use 
and acceptation of some words or phrases that 

me or fashion has condeiniieda certain 



old and new logic 

uir of simplicity and freedom that is peculiarly 
pleasing and attractive 
 as i have mentioned the atlantis i cannot 
forbear to notice that it is there stated under 
cover of a fiction that america was anciently 
ihe seat of a lettered and scientific people 
lord bacon who looked backwards and for 
wards with equal penetration felt convinced 
of this and promidgated his opinion though 
unsupported by a single adherent all the 
learned believed that writing and literature were 
confined to the old world and that the mexicans 
and peruvians had no progenitors more advanced 
than themselves this belief continued till the 
other day when the remains of a city were 
discovered furnishing indisputable proofe of 
bacon s conclusions yet his name is not men 
tioned as far as i know in any account or 
review of that most important discovery such 
is the fate of a man whose lightest works teem 
with matter for the philosopher b ut our wise 
men now so far from appreciating tis transcen 
anflnent are striving to throw him into the 
shade before he is half known or read 

the baconian and aristotelian 
systems considered in respect 
to their consequences 

it is admitted that hardly any one who gra 
duates in college understands logic though all 
there are obliged to learn it as a matter of course 
what a stupid imposition this and what a jrof 



s old and new logic 

ligate waste of time but we will soppoee thd 
baconian system substituted and that it were 
found equally difficult what tiien some 
trace or other generally remains on the memcny 
and here the balance is undoubtedly in fevor of 
bacon an imperfect recollection of syllogistic 
logic does great injury it makes a young man 
petulant headstrong and averse to sober 
reasoning — insomuch that those who forget it 
in toto have a decided advantage now in the 
other case tibe consequences are essentially 
different what though our student forget the 
entire routine he is at least taught humility and 
that no impression can be made by overweening 
confidence he may forget the whole list of 
prejudices completely but this much will remain 
that the object of the idols is to divest ourselves 
of all prejudices before we enter on any in 
tellectual investigation of induction he will 
recollect that it is a mode of inquiry by a 
dispassionate and industrious examination and 
which requires us to hear and consider without 
impatience opinions oppos e d to our own 
which of thetwo systems the baconian or tbe 
aristotelian should parents wish their sons to be 
taught 

syllogistic logic viewed in every possible 
way appears to be something worse than useless 
it never yet made a good reasoner for when 
it was used by the learned their disquisitions had 
generally an air of flightiness and uiey rarely 
arrived at any solid conclusions those who 
know it now do not use t m ia wxltia or 



old and new logic 

otherwise and a little knowledge of it is 
extremely pernicious the baconian logic is 
on the contrary every way useful it is the 
grand engine for investigating the sciences and 
for beating down the petty wiles of syllogistic 
quibbling while the most trifling knowledge 
of it has this merit that it layg a foundation 
for unexceptionable morab ty wc ftiay asseir 
without anystrammg at amplification that it 
does some part of the business of the clergyman 
and the pulpit 

parents would not let their sons be taught 
aristdtelian logic if they were sufficiently aware 
of its demoralising tendency the question is 
simply viould they have them modest be 
comingly diffident and not full of what the 
french call opinicureti if they would let 
them learn the baconian logic in its stead i 
hope to see the day when they will generally 
insist on this for that would indeed lay the axo 
to the root and prostrate the old peripatetic 
prejudices of oih universities 

the baconian system is christian logic for it 
accords with the amiable spirit of christianity — 
that of aristotle is pagan logic and is in keeping 
with the character of paganism i state this 
without any concern about what some who 
believe themselves to be excessively liberal 
may think proper to say let them not say 
however that i btame the greeks for not having 
been christians how could they be christians 
before christ appeared no but i blatofe

mythology whi a w as their relion that they 
could have doij but it would not appear to 
suit their views we may see their notions 
of wisdom in the vaunted ulysses who was 
distinguished for mendacity and craftiness — to 
say nothing of his being an adulterer and 
debauchee for those seemed to be almost indis 
pensable requisites to a place among their 
divinities could we reasonably expect any 
logical system except one based on stratagem 
to be u favorite among a people having such 
ideas of wisdom i boldly assert that syllo 
gistic logic is not only inconsistent with but 
disgraceful to christianity it suited paganism 
well but let those who now advocate it consider 
whether they are not however unconsciously 
supporting pagan morality they ought to put 
the spartan boy as a frontispiece to their 
treatises in order that oiu youth should be 
continually reminded of the admirable grecian 
precept that thiea d ng is a virtue provided it be 
managed so as to elude discovery to render 
it still more impressive it might be made up 
into a very instructive syllogism 

again i call on parents who profess 
christianity to look to their sons i tell them 
that they have no excuse for they have every 
thing in their own power they have only 
to require that their sons be taught the baconian 
not syllogistic logic let them not be under 
any apprehensions of a refusal college direc

completion of bacon 

it is well own that lord bacon was unable 
to complete his grand design as regards philo 
sophy this he foresaw and declared himself 
but he continued notwithstanding to work at it 
till death called him away it was to establish 
a system of philosophy on the severe and chaste 
principles of experimental research and he 
labored at this herculean imdertaking with a 
vigor and earnestness considering his dis graces 
and bad health that must ever be a subject 
of admiration fortunately he has left his 
whole plan so completely laid out and the 
materials for construction so ample in his 
prodromi or fifth part of the instauration that 
the completion is now quite practicable it was 
intended as a means for erecting the sixth and 
last part called philosophia secunda sive 
scientia activa of which he had only put up 
the scaffolding 

yet no attempt has been made to finish this 
magnificent and supereminently usefiil structure 
is it that intellectual capacity cannot be found 
or that aristotles fiippery is more attractive 
as it would be pauifui lo movc ovss aa 



 old and new logic 

causes i shall content myself by exhorting the 
learned to turn their thoughts towards this very 
important owect true it is a vast undertaking 
for many additions must now be made but let 
them recollect that one man would have com 
pleted it as far as knowledge then permitted if 
death had spared him a few years longer and 
that he left the plan and the materials ready i 
do not say this with any view to diminish their 
merit bu on the contrary to encourage ihem 
bacon is like a homer or milton wluch cen 
turies on centuries are required to produce and 
the npblest work in which the learned could en 
gage would be the completion of that which 
death alone prevented him from accomphshing 

speaking on this subject a writer of his life 
who was probably dr birch says — 

the learned of all countries from his 
bacons days have been only laboring some 
separate or lesser parts of this amazing edifice 
which ages to come may not see finished 
according to the model left them by this one 



man 



now i earnestly call on england to rescue 
herself from this reproach to her intellect her 
judgment and her understanding what a 
disgrace if germany or france should be the 
first to finish that which her own philosopher 
planned she has not yet i llustrated effn hig 
inductive system her universities are ousied 
in the silly task of i make no blunder as dr 
whately testifies teaching an unteachable logic 
whilst the mightiest gemi ix evet mmed

neglected and sheds his light in vain on stultified 
afistotelianism 



¥ 



i find that the rev w whewell in the 
preface to his history of the inductive sciences 
feebly adverts to the completion of bacon 
t eebly i say because in such a work he should 
have spoken out most emphatically and de 
cidedly on what concerned science and his own 
general subject so very materially but we 
need not wonder at this when he sap hardly 
any thing about logic though it was that which 
retarded and debased the inductive sciences 
and kept them so long the sport of whimsical 
speculation an unsound method of reasoning 
was the cause of so much tbliy inphiiooph 
and he ought to have exhibited the source ot 
all that folly i am very proud however to 
have so distinguished a name as whewell on 
my side for the completion of bacon 

bacon and aristotle compared 

no persons are better fitted for comparison 
than those two great philosophers one ruled 
over the mental faculties for twenty centuries 
and the dominion of bacon will in all likelihood 
be as lasting as the world itself for we can 
hardly suppose printing to be ever extirpated 
and while there is any utewtoa a a 
the guide of reasoning andbdetic 



 old and new logic 

but a regular comparison is beyond my 
ability that would require talents and learn 
ing which i do not possess and i must therefore 
premise that i mean to take only a cursory 
view of the general value of their respective 
writings 
u i shall begin with their organons as they 
are my principal concern aristotle is here 
greatly praised for his inventive genius yet 
surely the categories are a most important part 
of his structure and they are not his production 
this is admitted even by dr whately who 
says without any reserve that they were 
invented by archytas take them away from 
aristotle and his great system of logic would 
be very naked and then again there are the 
predicables which it is said though i think 
without good proofe belong to porphrry 
the syllogism itself was vielded by other 
logicians before aristotle so that he has not 
the merit of its first introduction to the art of 
reasoning and it is well known that sophisms 
were used lon g be fore his time in point of 
invention he has not therefore such mighty 
claims as his encomiasts allege especially if we 
consider what a great deal of knowledge he 
must have drawn from his amiable and un 
assuming master 

as an inventer bacon has infinitely more 

merit we may fairly say that he invented 

induction as a logical engine what was 

known before was worse than total ignorance 

for it was as lainbe£ tr ovjtves utterly 



old and new logic 

vicious and incompetent it sought to invent 
not to seek the principles of sciences which 
was a sad misuse of intellect and as different 
from his induction as light is from darkness 
the similitude is a very common one though 
here of singular aptitude for his was light itself 
while the other was truly a melancholy darkness 
— a fit companion for the syllogistic theory 

then as to the idols they are solely and 
entirely bacons this is the opinion of dr 
reid from whom i have already given a quo 
tation to that eflfect if there be any thing new 
they are for no one else ever thout ot such a 
foundation for logic and it certainly is the only 
true one for any system of reasoning or of 
intellectual inquiry i am far from considering 
invention as a test of superiority for greater 
genius may be required in perfecting or im 
proving what has been already sketched out 
but if there be a question on the merit of 
invention i think that bacon must bear away 
the palm as to the utility of the two 
organons i may be allowed to say that the 
good sense of the world has decided against 
aristotle 

but much is said of aristotles other works 
and of the mighty genius and versatility of 
talents that he there evinced i have no wish 
to underrate his merit but i should suppose 
that a philosopher prides himself most on his 
ontology and physics and those of aristotle are 
replete with errors chiefly arising from pre 
sumption and a total coivtfttkl qi vmssi 



 old and new logic 

his zoology considering that he was the first 
who treated the study rularly is a valuable 
work and his judgment in rhetoric and poetry 
is generally adinitted as he was a pagan it 
might be unfair to speak of his ethics but i 
believe that his politics are much inferior to 
some modem treatises on government he 
wrote on several other subjects too for gillies 
tells us that he left treatises of which 
we have only though dr browne says 
in his classical dictionary almost all his 
writings which are composed on a variety of 
subjects are extant we have however 
sufficient whereby to judge of his abilities and 
certainly bacon need not fear to stand in com 
petition it is comparatively easy to speculate 
or moralise at least it comes easy to a man 
of genius but to be constantly pointing out new 
sources of knowledge is in fact to be constantly 
making new discoveries and requires vastly 
superior abilities now bacons principal works 
are all of that description and they evince such 
powerful resources of mind and such amazingly 
varied information that aristotle seems little 
indeed when placed by his side 

we must also take into account that owing 
to the influence of aristotles pernicious logic 
and erroneous philosophy bacon found the 
sciences and general knowledge in a state of 
infancy or at most of adolescence he had 
literally to set up as their schoolmaster and 
to undertake their education in this gigantic 
scheme it may be said that he left nothing 



old and new logic 

untouched from the most abstruse studies 
he did not disdain to investigate the lowest — 
even husbandry dovn to a compost or manure 
his capacious intellect penetrated into every 
thing that concerns life or society — he ascended 
and descended dth equal fieicility in such a 
prodigious range is it any wonder that he 
should sometimes appear weak or trifling 
yet some occasional observations of little or 
no value in the midst of ten thousand im 
portant suggestions have called forth petty 
sneers though such fidlures should redound 
to his praise he had no paltry anxiety about 
fame and when any thing occurred which he 
thought might tend to the improvement of an 
art or study however slight his acquaintance 
with it he gave the hint regardless of whether 
he exposed his own ignorance or not i think 
that it forcibly shows his magnanimity and his 
ardent desire to be useful even at uie risk of 
that which is so dear to us all reputation 

how different this picture from that of aris 
totle that conceited philosopher whose 
distinguishing feature was vanity tells nothing in 
an artless way for he is as well supplied wi th 
cloaks as horaces lucullus dr keici alluding 
to his presumption lu delurmining things above 
all human knowledge says — 

 rather than confess his ignorance he hides 
it under hard words and ambiguous expressions 
of which his interpreters can make what pleases 
them 

read that ye silly peripatetics who rave 

m 



 old and new logic 

about the omniscience of your idol there he 
is plainly charged with ignorance and that in 
addition to all his dogmatical errors whatever 
ye may say of me ye cannot affect to think 
lightly of dr reid for he knew his author well 
and could properly estimate his merits and 
demerits but indeed he could not as a man of 
impartiality speak otherwise he found aris 
totle constantly assuming his mere opinions as 
facts for he does so even in his zoology and is 
not that ignorance if he were alivays or 
even mostly right it would certainly show his 
acumen but he is oftener wrong his ignorance 
is of the most unpardonable description for he 
presumed to know more than he did know 
here his vanity overpowered what good sense 
he possessed and that is perhaps the worst kind 
of ignorance especially when attempted to be 
disguised by ambiguous and mjrsterious lan 
guage it is true that ignorance is defined as a 
want of knowledge and that he had a large 
share of varied information but i fear that his 
greatest admirers must admit that he was not 
honest as a writer and a certain degree of 
ignorance is inseparable from such dishonesty 
what a contrast does bacon exhibit he 
disarms his enemies by his modesty while 
aristotle disgusts his very friends by his pride 
vanity and envy the english philosopher 
throws open his vast stores of knowledge 
without any ostentation and offers them as 
merely a collection of hints or suggestions

othe original inventor or discoverer take for 
an instance the following — 

 in preparation of medicines i do find 
strange especially considering how mineral 
medicines have been extolled and that t hey are 
safer for the outward than inward parts that no 
man hath sought to make an imitation by art of 
natural baths and medicinable fountains which 
nevertheless are confessed to receive their virtues 
from minerals and not so only but discerned 
and distinguished from what particular mineral 
they receive tincture as sulphur vitriol steel or 
e like which naturie it it may be reduced to

will be increased and the temper of them will 
be more commanded 

now you can fairly judge of bacons unos 
tentatious mode there is the discovery of 
medicated baths announced without any parade 
whatsoever indeed so far from any pride he 
labors to despatch it in a protracted single sen 
tence as though it were not worth a second 
what a rout would not others make about such 
a thought why they would contrive to occupy 
an entire volume in its development but with 
him it was only as a grain of sand out of a heap 
his modesty in thus mesrely suggesting has caused 
him to be overlooked in several instances we 
have medicated baths every where now and i 
verily believe that not one of their proprietors 
know that they are indebted to bacon for the 
discovery of this i can give nearly a proof 
sir arthur clarke a leained mxojwgt a 



 old and new logic 

faculty and author of some valuable medical 
publicationty has an excellent establishment of 
that kind in dublin where one may have any 
of the spas of england or the continent and 
of a stronger quality if required — and yet in a 
treatise on artificial mineral waters wherein 
their origin and progress are traced he does not 
mention the name of bacon now as he is a 
writer of more than ordinary research and eru 
dition and who is besides well versed in both 
the practice and history of chemistry i need 
not go further to show how little is known of 
our inmiortal philosopher though we have all 
grown wiser by his labors when he thus escapes 
sir arthur i may almost presume that no other 
writer on a similar subject has assigned him 
tiie discovery 

yet upwards of two centuries have not ex 
hausted bacons rich treasury of knowledge for 
many important hints lie there still unheeded 
he is in good truth only spoken of — not read 
those who chance to look into him flpantly 
turn away in disdain when they stumble on 
some things now well known to every one wi 
out ever recollecting that it was he who made 
them trite i do think that one might work on 
a valuable hint out of bacon and take credit 
for the originality without any fear of detection 

this great man knew well how undeserving 
his own country was of his philosophical labors 
and for which reason he caused what he wrote 
in english to be translated into latin in order 
to the diffusion of his immortal works qn the 



old and new logic 

continent he reserved however the expres 
sion of his displeasure for his last will which 
has these remarkable words my name and 
memory i leave to foreign nations and to mine 
own countrymen after some time be passed 
over whata prophetic spirit it is indeed 
a disgrace to ttngland that he should be so ne 
glected and that a pagan and perriwigpated 
logic should still be taught in our colleges instead 
of his christian and rational system there is 
a saying on the continent even among the com 
mon people as learned as bacon which 
proves how early his merit was there estimated 
while here one must be of some reading to have 
heard of him at all there every one knows 
at least that there was a very learned man called 
bacon — here we have our hundred thousands 
perhaps millions who know not that such a 
person ever existed 

of ignorance such as that charged to aris 
totle bacon cannot be accused though he 
sometimes evinces weakness i of course allude 
only to what are properly his philosophical works 
and this must be taken also in a very particular 
sense for instance in the advancement of 
learning his base flattery of james must be 
left out as having nothing to do with our pre 
sent considerations he was strictly honest only 
in his scientific inquiries — we can place little 
dependence on him in other respects as a 
philosopher he was singular in his zeal for 
truth — as a man he was too much biassed by 
selfinterest to have a proper regard for integrity 



 old and new logic 

keeping this distinction in view we shall no 
where find so much learning and knowledge 
with so little alloy the trifling matter 
occasionally found in his works and which is 
much dwelt on by those who would depreciate 
him calls for no remark beyond what i have 
already observed that it redounds more to his 
praise than his discredit but some go further 
and accuse him of sometimes assuming hypo 
theses as facts in violation of his own rules 
now suppose though no instances are given 
that we admit the charge ill they say that he 
lays them down as positive or unerring pnnci 
pie s after the fashion of aristotle i think 
nol here lies a great differencetetween the 
two philosophers bacon assumes no magiste 
rial air his very errors are instructive because 
where he does not enter into a proper scrutiny 
he submits himself in a manner to our examina 
tion and does not dictatorially insist besides 
he showed us a certain method of detecting his 
own errors as for instance his opposition to the 
copemican system while anstotlej by his 
dugmaticatebbimptions filled the world with 
visionaries and left them no mode of relief 
because he blocked up the road to truth by a 
formidable army of categories and syllogisms 
i know of only one instance where bacon 
approaches to that ignorance of which aristotle 
is so often guilty and that is in his christian 
paradoxes he begins by showing that in 
christianity we must believe in things that are 
incomprehensible to our teaaoxi iwvnct 



old and new logic 

proper for if we reject all mysteries away 
goes the christian religion at once but as he 
proceeds he becomes more and more paradoxi 
calf till at last he leaves his christian a fair 
subject for pity or scorn here he conceived 
more than he had ability to delineate for he no 
where appears to be irreligious and if he were 
he was not the man to proclaim what would 
injure him with his patrons h e ought to have 
torn that fatal paper for god knows he had 
traiities enough without needlessly exposing 
himself to the additional charge of deism or at 
least of ridiculing christianity — of which i think 
we may safely pronounce him to be completely 
innocent 
ter in summing up the merits of our two philo 
sophers there appears an astounding difference 
let us call on the admirers of aristotle to re 
count his services perhaps they will say that 
he has given us good rules tor the stage which 
by the bye we do not follow— that he has fur 
nished the principles of rhetoric and written 
very learnedly on poetry and has left us a his 
tory of philosophy and the zoography of his 
own times very well but let them now put 
in the balance the injuries he has inflicted he 
kept the noble study ot astronomy degraded for 
eighteen centuries as shown in page where 
i beg that may be read for — he 
debased mens understanding by a mse philoso 
phy and kept the sciences stationary by a per 
fidious logic during the long period of almost 
twenty centuries i o nox w w w 



 old and new logic 

words but i cannot help calling that logic per 
fidious which as ample experience has confirmed 
is inimical to the integrity of reasonings and to 
morality itself 

bacons services are so nimierous that it would 
be vain to attempt a recapitulation we must 
therefore take only a kind of general view 
whatever advancement the sciences have made 
for the last two hundred years belongs to him 
he first showed the true method to study them 
and the proof of its efficacy is their rapid pro 
gress notwithstanding the opposition of univer 
sities to him we are also indebted for a more 
rational turn to metaphysics by showmg that 
syllogistic pageantry led only to chimericed pur 
suits such as those in which aristotles followers 
were so uselessly engaged along with these 
inappreciable benefits we are not to forget his 
actual discoveries nor his direct suggestions for 
the improvement of particular branches of sci 
ence he liberated the human faculties fiom a 
disgraceful slavery and by furnishing a better 
logic than the delusive syllogism he opened the 
road to a real instead of a deceptions process 
of argument 

then as to injuries he inflicted none 
he was the fiiend of wellregulated fieedom 
and the enemy of licentious excursions into the 
regions of intellectual inquiry the world never 
produced a philosopher who had less of the 
dictatorial or dogmatic spirit it is astonishing 
how he could keep such stupendous intellect 
under so complete a subjection we feel no 



old and new logic 

humiliation in acknowledging as our mast 
him who first knocked off our fetters and then 
assumed no other authority than to warn us of 
those errors that lead to an abuse of our liberty 
he is the safest guide that ever appeared both 
in rule and practice for the exercise ot our 
reasoning faculties— his own example itself 
being a perpetual admonition against selfconceit 
prejudice or hasty judgment 

the friends of aristotle find it difficult to 
defend him while the enemies of bacon are 
always puzzled how to turn us against his 
doctrines in rees cyclopaedia under the 
article aristotle which is altogether rather 
favorable to that philosopher there is the follow 
ing as a kind of summary or general estimate — 

 upon the whole it has been observed by 
competent and candid judges that the philosophy 
of aristotle is rather the philosophy of words 
than of things and that the study of his writings 
tends more to perplex the imderstanding with 
subtile distinctions than to enlighten it with real 
loiowieage 

the article bacon in dr brewsters edin 
burgh encyclopaedia is evidently penned in a 
spirit of hostility to that great man chiefly i think 
on account of lus unfortunate character l hough 
that should never mtluence any one against his 
immortal genius i am willing to take it here as 
some ejccuse for prejudicial feelings and yet after 
all what do we find general but not specific 
charges the writer labors to show that his 
merit is overrated because mens minds had 



 old and new logic 

been previously prepared to cast off the yoke 
of authority and to revolt from the dogmas 
of aristotle but after several general accu 
sations without producing even one solitary 
instance he says — 

 with all these faults and others on which 
it might seem invidious to dwell bacon must 
be allowed the merit of having bequeathed to 
the world a larger and more precious mass of 
sound logical instructions deduced from his own 
reflections than are to be found in the wtitings 
ot all the authors who preceded him 

look now at the two summaries — on 
this picture and upon that bring forward 
aristotles friends and bacons enemies hear 
what they have to say respectively and bacon 
will be found to outweigh aristotle as an ele 
phant to an ass 

the london university 

ultra conservatism is bad enough in politics 
but it is exceedingly stupid in literature i have 
no objection to even a large portion of caution 
because it is necessary to keep rash innovators 
in check but when it extends to a fear of any 
change it defeats its own object and converts 
moderate reformers into ultra radicals who 
generally succeed in carrying more than they 
originally contemplated ultra conservatism is 
the parent of narrow principles and confined 
views and those who profess it however other 
ivise learned can hardly be supposed to have 
an enlarged understanding 



old and new logic 

our colleges are renowned for this doctrine 
they see danger in every change and would 
tremble at any in the students caps or gowns 
occasionally indeed they substitute one greek 
or roman classic for another which they regard 
as a great concession to the hateful spirit of 
novelty but in science they are filled vith 
 saucy doubts and fears and with admiration 
of the medes and persians whose laws were 
never to be altered as they are to a certain 
extent under government control they are con 
sequently to a certain extent not fiee and it 
was all ihose considerations that gave rise to the 
london university which was to be wholly 
uninfluenced and independent and at full liberty 
to adopt the most enlightened plan of instruction 

now i would ask its managers what they 
are doing about logic have they rejected 
aristotles system and caused bacons to be 
digested into a teachable form they profess 
not to interfere with religion which i think is 
very proper but every one expects that they 
should inculcate sound morality aristotles 
logic is opposed to honesty and fair dealing 
it is the logic of gamesters or triflers and is 
consequently injurious to morals bacons logic 
is from its nature in hostility to quibbling or 
petty advantages it is the logic of integrity 
and candor and conduces to lay a foundation 
for good morality whatsoever may be our reli 
gion let parents look to this who send their 
sons to the london university in expectation 
of an improved course of educatioxv 



 old and new logic 

i know not what sort of logic is taught there 
hut i am quite sure that it is a matter of great 
consequence in education whatever kind we 
learn in youth though we may completely forget 
the entire routine or management leaves a cer 
tam impression and its influence is afterwards 
felt according as it is an artful and captious or 
an honest and investigative system the lon 
don university is a perfectly free and unshackled 
institution it has no old prejudices to combat 
and is at full liberty to adopt what the public 
have been led to expect a liberal and enlight 
ened course if it teach peripatetic logic it 
departs from the spirit of its original professions 
but i should hope that it requires only a hint 
to do what is right 

at all our colleges the fellows or teachers 
find time to write learned works and i submit 
to those of the london university to take bacon 
into their serious consideration let them first 
illustrate his inductive system and then proceed 
to the completion of his grand philosophical 
scheme their leisure could not be more nobly 
or more usefiilly employed it would confer 
literary immortality on themselves and render 
their establishment celebrated throughout the 
civilised world 

conclusion 

in taking my leave i will not conceal that i 
depend a great deal on the ladies for thslt 
reformation which i bo strenuously advocate 



old amd nsw logic 

they are allowed hi be generally muck more 
religioua than men and when they eee plainly 
the demoralising tendency of byllogistjc logic 
they will no doubt exert their powerful 
influence against it and support the baconian 
method hitherto they have been completely 
excluded from logic as a teience utterly above 
their compreheneion for even madajne de 
stael who waa a man in literature contented 
herself with the examination of philosophical 
syateme but i flatter myself that i have ren 
dered its cmiftilution universally intelligible 
and that they will now venture to interfere 
at least where the education of their sons is 
in question i have a strong hope too that 
they will materially contribute towards reforming 
the mode of teaching the classics from my 
sketch of the plan pursued though much more 
concise than i could wish they will eee the 
necessity of some change for they cannot but 
perceive that morality is there also deeply 
involved it is surely right to aak their md 
when men perdneciously combine to disseminate 
ignorance and profligacy — and it would be a 
curious and triumphal epoch in female history 
if the ladies achieved the victory of correcting 
those vicious systems of universities which i 
think i have shown to be aotichristian 

i am fully aware that the knowledge 
retardere will laugh heartily at my appealing 
to the sex but perhaps they will not have to 
laugh so long as they may think barefaced as 
they are they dare not defend irreligon and 



 old and new logic 

well they know that female power is here 
anything but contemptible with christian 
and knowledge in their mouths and pagan 
and ignorance in their hearts they have too 
long imposed on the lords of the creation — 
we shall now see whether the women can be so 
easily cajoled i have shown that syllogistic 
logic is suitable only to that absurd heathenism 
whence it sprang and that the mode of classic 
instruction is repugnant to christian notions and 
sure i am now that an unhallowed combination 
is fairly exposed that no educated lady will 
hesitate to oppose an organised system of 
demoralisation and intellectual debasement 

not having the vanity to think that what 
i say should have a convincing effect i request 
the ladies to keep a steady eye on the authorities 
that i have quoted against syllogistic mummery 
the names of bacon and locke two of the 
most enlightened philosophers that any age or 
coimtry ever produced would be alone sufficient 
to condemn such a burlesque on reasoning for 
who will have the presumption to say that he 
is superior to them here we might securely 
rest but when we find them openly supported 
by succeeding great men besides the numberless 
others who as explained in page to 
silently approve the evidence and conviction 
become absoluiely irresistible let me there 
fore recommend tlie ladies to read only from the 
nineteenth paragraph to the end of lecture 
and brst nine paragraphs of the next following 
by the late very leamea dx tvxotfta btown 



old and new looic 

on the philosophy of the mind which are 
devoted to an examination of the syllogigtic 
theory and written in a plain and rather play 
ful style considering his general ecrioiuiiiess 
there they will find that worse than triflbg 
art as he justly calls it frly exhibited to 
view and impartially examined in al its 
bearings by an upright and competent judge 
here is mcrtter for another tremendout laugh — 
bending ladies to read philosophy aye indeed 
the sublime philosophy of syllogistic trickery 
— but lest our worthy anti knowledge leaguers 
ehould get into convulsions i must administer 
something to allay their fearful risibility akin a t 
to adam smiths removal from the choir of itc ft 
in glasgow dr brown one of the most profound 
reasoners of our times was refiised it in 
edinburgh though no one could then fill it 
so efficiently but his sentiments on the worse 
than trifling art were known and he too wae 
appointed professor of moral philosophy in 
order to quiet him he there proved however 
to be a little too honest for management and in 
that situation he hsd the courage though it 
basarded his prospects in life to deliver those 
two lectures to which i now invite tie attention 
of my female readers there is not much here 
as apprehend to excite iaughtrindeed 
college proceedings too often make the judi 
cious grieve 

is it to be endured that to keep up a gross 
imposture weak or designmg men should lay 
down a rule that none of tttt okua a 



 old and new logic 

comprehend the awul mybteries of syllogisldc 
 science to which nevertheless boys of 
fifteen are admitted this is making a rare 
distinction truly between male and female 
intellect so then their mothers who may be 
forty or fifty years old must not even ask what 
this questionable logic means though their sons 
not yet weaned off fiom tops and marbles 
are deemed wise enough for its study will 
they any longer i seriously ask them submit to 
such a degradation — such a contemptuous insidt 
to their understanding if they do then let 
them rest satisfied to be held as inferior beings 
in the scale of intellectual creation they have 
as good a right nay it is their duty to inquire 
about what their sons as well as their daughters 
are learning for this it is not necessary to 
to know greek or latin there are now 
either literal or fiee translations of all the 
classics and they should examine at least those 
for school and college use nor would it be 
amiss to look into some others that are not 
taught there for by reading certain portions 
that are omitted through mere shame they will 
be the better enabled to judge of the shocking 
and revolting principles of heathenism altogether 
this might seem to be an arduous task but 
how could mothers be better employed than in 
qualifying themselves to oppose an educatioiial 
system so prejudicial to their offspring the 
labor would not however be so great as it 
might appear many of them have readily 
gone through the eiiliie oicoxvssvdoems

therefore to see that her eon be taught an

testimony that the baconian is tlie only honest 
hnd rational method and that aristotles is 
calculated for opinionative petulance and to 
warp end mislead the judgment the two 
systems are now exposed — the rubbish is 
removed that prevented them from being 
generally understood and mothers should do 
tiieir duty where fathers will not 

i have only glanced at what some persons 
as lockes biogruiber significantly says in my 
quotation page ere doing with respect to 
education no one surely will accuse the 
colleges of intentionally fevoring any thing 
bordering on irreligion their greatest enemies 
could not do that and yet it is to be feared that 
they are fay teaching a aty msm bkjairof

modating logic and an unqualified admiration 
of pagan writers unintentionally promoting that 
bane of society religious infidelity or fiee 
thinking and also laxity of morals i hope 
yet to have an opportunit of going into that 
subject at the length which its importance 
demands and i must now content myself with 
observing that some persons know well that 
i have been necessarily obliged to touch lightly 
on what is called classical learning yes 
necessarily for they know that my hands are 
in a manner tied up and that i dare not soil 
my paper with even an allusion to the horrid 
depravity of their favorite poet virgil whose 
praise they are never tired of sounding 

but lest they may impose on the uninformed 
by alleging that history however revolting 
should not be falsified for any purpose i must 
anticipate such petty deception by observing 
that what i condemn is not concerned with the 
validity of history it is to the poets i allude 
who absolutely smg the praises of the most 
shocking and disgusting vices juvenal is the 
only one who boldly lashed corruption and yet 
he when attacking certain licentiousness of his 
day proposes a corrective at which human nature 
shudders and turns with horror fiom the monster 
who could deliberately publish that which 
would be enough to blanch tiiie sable cheek of the

indignation against swift and who scruple to 
admit a monument to lord byron in west

there would be no objection to erect a cenotaph 
though to the great honor of gospel light the 
most abandoned or prothgate christian never 
wrote any thing half so impious or scandalous 
as what we find in the classics 

let not •some persons think that i write

hands of every schoolboy leammg latin but 
you never heard of this no more than of the 

dread jupiters thought to mention it 

but my courage fails a more fitting oppor 
tunity will yet be presented for unmasking the 
infiimous conceptions of what we are told to 
call classical taste 

the mischief is in fact already done to its 
extent and it is but crud mockery to any longer 
affect delicacy it only now remains for the 
well disposed to repair the damages and to 
arrest the further progress of heathenish con 
tagion even setting aside the disgusting gross 
ness of pagan writers their general principles 
are injurious the learned french jesuit 
sanadon who most laboriously collated and 
reviewed horace a century ago cites one of his 
odes to show that he was an epicurean and 
that he believed in the mortality of the soul 
though he strives to generally conceal it through 
policy and is constantly invoking the gods 
mortality here means that himian death is the 
same as that of a dog or a rat or properly 
speaking that we have no souls that is 
bad enough but epicurism goes further — it 
is atheism its followers attributed every thing 
to nature or chance and that is atheism in 
the strict sense despicable as was the mytho 
logy it at least acknowledged a providence 
though in a bungling manner and also a future 
state but epicurus denied both one and the 
other now sanadon cites another ode of 
horace to show that vie eeftd ilia impious 



old and new logic 

doctiine of fortuitous jumbling of atoms or 
chance and yet this man of no religion — this 
preacher of abstemiousness in mockery and of 
voluptuousness in earnest — this atheist i 
say is held up to youth as the great enlightened 
guide and sage moralist no writer is so often 
quoted by the learned and every line of him 
is taught even in the entrance course prescribed 
to our schools by the colleges 

i must not dismiss sanadon thus lightly for 
i have here a crow to pluck never was 
there a more elaborate or painstaking editor 
of horace as a restorer he astonishes us 
by his prodigious industry extensive reading 
and indefatigable perseverance he did not 
leave a single word of his author unconsidered 
— he fixes the chronological accuracy of all his 
pieces — ogives his age when he wrote each — 
removes verses lines and sometimes even 
solitary words into their presumed locality 
elsewhere — corrects the errors of former trans 
cribers and commentators and makes a new 
arrangement altogether in text disposition and 
order we may judge of his unwearied dili 
gence by one expression in his preface of 
all the pieces of horace i leave but three in 
their ancient situation he further says i 
every where prefix new titles and new argu 
ments one piece i sometimes divide into two 
and of several i sometimes make but one i 
weed out several verses which have sometimes 
appeared under the poets name in some others 
i change the received distributoi ¥at sr

alteration he gives his reasons at length and we 
must not forget that he also translated his 
author 

yet the able article in the last quarterly 
review no on mr tates horatius 
restitutus does not say a word of sanadon 
but for this i do not think that the reviewers 
should be blamed we cannot reasonably 
expect that amidst their varied literary duties 
they should know every author on each par 
ticular subject indeed we ought rather to 
wonder at the intimate knowledge those all 
work critics commonly evince especially when 
we know that there cannot be aflforded a 
separate writer for each department of art or 
science he who now reiew a classic may 
be next called upon for strictures on astronomy 
railroads chemistry mathematics or politics 
and here it is that they are very differently cir 
cumstanced from mr tate who tell us that he 
was closely engaged vith horace for more 
than one third of a century now though 
i have not seen mr tates work i presume 
that if he had mentioned sanadon the quar 
terly reviewers would not have passed him by 
entirely and assuming the omission to lie at his 
door what can he say in defence after 
thirty four years study of his author it would be 
a reproach nay he ought himself to deem it an 
insult to suppose him unacquainted with 
sanadon — his fellowlaborer in the horatian 
vineyard and who toiled so learnedly in the 
same restituting vocation mr tate calls his 



old and new logic 

work horatius restitutus or the books of 
horace arranged in chronological order which 
is also the grand object of sanadon and 
therefore these two questions obviously arise 
did mr tate think sanadon beneath his 
notice or did he draw unacknowledged 
information from his ample but neglected 
stores 

the quarterly reviewers dwell forcibly on 
the benefits of having through a consecutive 
order like mr tates a view of rome by such 
a masterhand as horace at the very interesting 
period in which he lived now let them read 
what sanadon says after many other observa 
tions on the utility of a just chronological 
arrangement — 

but the most considerable advantage is 
that in reading this excellent poet we shall read 
a series of faithful history of the first emperor 
of rome written by an author his contemporar 
and adorned with all the graces of the most 
charming poetry this alone should suiquce 
to justify the new order i have given to the 
works of my author 

after that i think they will admit that the 
merit of mr tates restitutus cannot be 
fauly estimated without a diligent comparison 
with that of sanadon mr tates may be 
superior but that must be tried 

i shall make no apology for this digression 
on the contrary i claim thanks from the en 
glish and scotch for introducing the forgotten 
sanadon because he does full justice to their 



 old and new logic 

learned countrymen beutley and cunningham 
he calls them the best critics of our times 
and acknowledges that he has chiefly profited 
by their labors such praise fiom an erudite 
foreigner is always grateful though i grant that 
he fieauently disagrees with bentley while he 
pays cunningham the high comphment of sel 
dom dissenting fiom his judgment 

since i have digressed i shall trespass further 
in order to insert a remark that should have 
appeared in page when giving the meaning 
of peripatetic some overclassical writers have 
without any corresponding explanation called 
christ the divine peripatetic because he 
sometimes lectured or delivered his precepts 
while walking with his disciples the religious 
propriety of this application may be questioned 
inasmuch as the word has for centuries been 
understood to exclusively mean a follower of 
aristotle or used adjectively as pertaining to 
his doctrines yet where no irreverence is 
intended it might seem captious to raise an ob 
jection and i notice it only for the purpose of 
warning my unlearned readers who might be 
puzzled or misled by the expression that they

any more than the common dictionary meaning 
of peripatetic and is it not unworthy sport for 
the literati to make a plain man assert in com 
pany upon what he may deem safe authority 
that our saviour was an aristotelian 

to resume our subject of classical instruc 
tion — when the matter comes to plain speaking 
and an open investigation seems now unavoid 
able people will be shocked to think how long 
a corruptive and an antichristian system of 
education has prevailed and the public voice 
will irresistibly demand a change but its ad 
vocates know that the ablest men might write 
in vain for an alteration they tremble justly 
at enlightening the female world on this subject 
because they know that reformation mill be then 
inevitable and once more i say that no hypo 
critical cant about modesty will signify a jot 
the smooth faced declaimers may ring that 
tocsin as loud as they please — it will serve only 
to rally the foes of revolting turpitude inde 
cency and heathenism along with the pagan 
christian ethical education down goes as a matter 
of course the worse than trifling logic and 
then grave deceptions occupation is gone 

it cannot be said that the system has 
worked well — the common answer to all who 
desire any reformation if space permitted i 
could show that it never did work well but i 
must now confine myself to almost a single

educated than among those who have not it 
cannot well be otherwise under the plan pursued 
though there have been and will be always i 
hope many eminent exceptions for as it is 
not easy to imagine any thing more opposed to 
christian precepts than pagan morality when 
we are taught at an early age to admire it and 
to regard classical as a word including every 
thing that is chaste or beautiful can we be 
surprised at finding the pure doctrine of scrip 
ture so neglected it is almost as hard to 
admire one and revere the other properly as it 
would be to profess tvvo different religions at 
once 

what would be thought of him who should 
recommend through some wild notions of reli 
ioiis liberalism that a chapter in the koran 
ould be read in conjunction with one in the 
bible would he not be deemed a silly fanatic 
or denounced as a fit object for legal prosecu 
tion yet the approved mode of classical 
tuition is no less monstrous and incompatible — it 
is teaching a reverence for heathenism and 
christianity together 
 the change which i so earnestly advise is 
now especially desirable in fact no time ought 
to be lost for the enemy is at our very gates 
dr strauss a german savant has recently 
issued a third edition of his life of jesus 
the object of which is to show that christ was 
but a common man and that all his miracles

phemous work though comprising only two 
plain octavo volumes sells in london at the now 
very high price of a guinea and ahalf and that 
two editions were exhausted in little more than 
twelve months we may judge of the dangerous 
interest that it excites here is one of the 
most darnig attempts ever known to uproot 
christianity for strauss attacks no sect — his 
efforts being all directed to the one point that 
of proving or rather a christian should say 
endeavouring to prove our saviour to be an 
fmpostor are we then by continuing the 
teaching of a trickish logic and an admiration 
of heathen impurity to aid this wicked wretch — 
to be at least indirectly his allies in his profane 
war against christianity we see the deistical 
wolf prowling in our gospel fields and shall 
we still hesitate to secure the sheep

the impositions that are practised on them — if 
they really knew what lessons their sons are

 i am barely in time to notice the course of trinity

there is an augmentation of the old logic whue 
bacon remams as before which we may presume to 
be in conformity to the judtciaus determination of our 
british universities such are the auspicious pros

general another for its unflinching veneration of 
heathen precepts and the third for its magnanimous 
contempt of bacons idols and indvction
