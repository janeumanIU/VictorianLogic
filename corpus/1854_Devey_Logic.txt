preface 



the following pages comprise an attempt to systematise 
the various forms of inference engaged either in the con 
struction of science or in the generation of opinion and 
belief notwithstanding the diversity of the subject the 
author has endeavoured to meet its widest requirements 
not neglecting while he has devoted the greater portion of 
the treatise to the consideration of the laws and methods 
of inference in their simplest and most complex combina 
tions to include in his design a description of the different 
subjectmatter on which they are ordinarily employed and 
the foundations on which their processes ultimately rest 
if to views so discursive he has been able to impart any 
thing like systematic completeness the merit is due not 
so much to him as to the excellent treatises which have 
already elaborated distinct portions of the subject and guided 
him through much of his labour 

logic owing to the opposite schools of metaphysicians 
lias met with various and even conflicting treatment in 
nearly every age it appears to be the only subject of which 
the difficulties multiply with the spread of knowledge and 
which instead of disentangling itself from the quarrels of the 
past periodically carries forward all its old perplexities to be 
added to the account of the present the disputes of jenesi 
demus with the ancient stoics is still rife in germany and

the gauntlet which bacon threw down to the peripatetics of 
his age is as warmly taken up by their successors in the 
present as if the novum organum had been only yesterday 
ushered into the world hence in the present vacillating 
state of the science with its limits as well as its subjectmat 
ter depending on each individuals fancy or caprice no one 
knows when he finds the name of logic on the back of a 
work what he is to expect it may be a dish of metaphysics 
a dry piece of scholastic wrangling or an abstract treatise 
on method and should the views of the author be ultra 
the reader will not improbably find a great many pages taken 
up with anathematising every view of logic but that assumed 
in the text 

now this is not a satisfactory state of that science which 
concerns the operation of the faculty in which men chiefly 
glory not only as the mark which preeminently divides them 
from the brute creation but also as the primary source of 
those distinctions of rank and supremacy which obtain in 
society nor has the writer met with anything in logical 
treatises to necessitate the conflicting diversity of view in 
which they regard the science there is nothing in the body 
of aristotles speculative views to hinder them from being 
engrafted on the practical doctrines of bacon nor anything 
in the a priori methods of descartes essentially antagonist 
even to the inductive methods propounded by comte and 
helvetius apart from the metaphysical tenets of these 
schools the general body of their logical doctrines may 
be combined in one system all have their distinct func 
tions in the generation of scientific belief and by the diver 
sity of view which they bring to bear on any object tend to 
strengthen and verify the accuracy of each others processes 
the writer has therefore avoided the fragmentary treat 
ment of logic pursued by his predecessors and attempted 
to place the science on its right basis by grouping around 



preface vii 

the central idea of inference the various methods and sys 
tems which are connected with its functions in the leading 
divisions of knowledge the instruments may be diverse 
but they all range themselves as so many subordinate con 
ceptions round the leading idea of the science and may be 
regarded as so many means of dissipating doubt detecting 
error and placing trath beyond cavil 

some persons manifest as much care in adjusting the limits 
of a science as if they were laying down the confines of pro 
vinces or the boundaries of empires the writer has not 
deemed this exact nicety beneficial to a science which is in 
a greater measure than any other interwoven with every 
department of human knowledge he has therefore intro 
duced into his pages everything which had a strong bearing 
on inference whether as regards metaphysical discussions 
on the foundations of evidence or collateral disputes which 
have been raised in the present day on the doctrine of quan 
tification he has not however adopted any of the innova 
tions which sir w hamilton would introduce into the 
scholastic logic nor indeed omitted any portion of the 
aristotelian system except the part excluded by the intro 
duction of special canons for each figure with regard to 
the utility of the peripatetic system and its correlation with 
the other branches of logic the views of the writer are in a 
mean ratio to those of mill and whately while he concurs 
with bacon in deeming this branch of the subject more 
directly applicable to the moral sciences he does not con 
sider it entirely useless in physical investigation inasmuch 
as there can be no inference which may not be faulty as to 
form and which therefore is not open to receive the aid of 
the syllogistic canons 

in conclusion the author expresses his conviction that 

 bacons restriction referred to politics and theology but politics 
in his days was considered an a priori science 



till pkeface 

there are only two legitimate methods of treating a practical 
system of logic viz either by pursuing the method adopted 
in these pages of systematising all the processes of infer 
ence which are embodied in the various departments of 
knowledge or by selecting some particular province or 
group of sciences and pointing out the inferential methods 
employed in their construction in the direction of the first 
or general system of logic mills is the only attempt that has 
hitherto been made and he has excluded the aristotelian 
portion of the subject of the last or specific kind several 
treatises have appeared but in most cases carrying down the 
subject to subdivisions too minute to entitle logic to the 
claim of a distinct science when confined to the investi 
gation of a single subject as in oersterlens medicinische 
logik or in the clever treatise of george cornewall lewis 
on the methods of observation and reasoning in politics 
logic however valuable the results in other respects is taken 
out of its niche in the temple of the arts and blended with 
the substance of the other sciences

historical introduction 



it does not appear that either the african or asiatic 
nations were able at least before the grecian era to distin 
guish between the value of rational causes and fabulous 
traditions or ever habituated themselves to analysing their 
thoughts with a view to elaborate a code of rules for the 
practical guidance of the reasoning faculty the early 
greeks were the first people who deemed it requisite to the 
acquisition of correct knowledge to inquire into the real 
causes of things but their method of investigation faltering 
and uncertain led to few discoveries nor gave them sufficient 
confidence to draw up a code of logical rules for any other 
purpose than that of verbal dispute zeno the eleatic is 
the earliest logician to whom antiquity refers as furnishing 
the greeks with a method of wrangling calculated to ensure 
its possessor a triumph over any opponent who might venture 
to question his thesis but without further use or pretence 
unless it might be the collateral one of sharpening the 
mental faculties and leading to habits of intellectual acute 
ness though socrates charges the author of this work with 
obscurity and confusion in that part which treats of conse 
quences he did not scruple to adopt the interrogatory 
method of disputation epwrrjoir which forms the leading 



 an account is given in colebrookes essays vol ii p of an

blances to the aristotelian system that critics are disposed to rank its

feature of the work and to apply the collection of sophistical 
questions it contains for the purpose that zeno pointed out 
of leading any person with whom he might happen to dispute 
by the concession of some point which seemed unavoidable 
into the meshes of absurdity 

socrates however in furnishing brilliant illustrations of the 
efficiency of zenos dialectics distinguished three modes of 
analysis and laid the foundation of logic proper by intro 
ducing the terms genus and definition into the greek 
language the first analytical method which is similar to 
that employed by geometricians consists in admitting by 
hypothesis the truth of a proposition until we reject or affirm 
our judgment by inferentially linking it with some other 
recognised truth or absurdity of which an example may be 
found in the instruction given by socrates to critobulus re 
lative to the means of obtaining true friends and where he 
teaches euthydemus the necessary conditions of true go 
vernment the second of these methods either ascends from 
particular facts to abstract truths or detaches general notions 
from the particular groups which they include and may be 
characterised as analogous to the method pursued by natu 
ralists and the inductive system of bacon the third 
separates the notions which are associated with complex 
ideas and by distinguishing their properties tends to dis 
pel the confusion which is apt to lurk beneath their indis 
criminate assimilation this method has some resemblance 
to the resolving process of mechanicians and chemists and is 
warmly recommended by condillac perhaps there is nothing 
on which socrates bestowed more attention than this case of 
determining complex ideas by a close examination of the 
elements into which they are capable of being resolved as 
may be seen in the memorabilia where he endeavours to 
define the idea of wisdom virtue goodness justice and piety 
and in the second alcibiades where he distinguishes the dif 
ferent species of ignorance with their corresponding effects 
and in the crito where he fixes the true value to be at

tached to the opinion of the people and the essential cha 
racteristics of justice occasionally socrates weaves the 
three modes of procedure into the same demonstration alter 
nately employing each according as the different parts ad 
mitted of their application 

previous to the time of socrates philosophy had been 
delivered in language borrowed from the poets and even as 
taught by zeno it only furnished a species of amusement to 
the sophists who met beneath the royal portico of athens 
to perplex each other with metaphysical subtleties and 
darken thought by words of vague import socrates was 
the first to aim at the creation of a philosophical language 
by introducing and insisting upon the practice of definition 
as an essential preliminary to correct inference and re 
solving all the disputes of his day into cases of verbal equivo 
cation he dared to strip philosophy of the meretricious 
ornaments of rhetoric and make language a faithful mirror 
for the reflection of the most delicate rays of thought 

of the pupils of socrates euclid and antisthenes de 
veloped the doctrines of zeno the former expanded the 
third part of his treatise which referred to sophistical ques 
tions and is the author of many of the fallacies attributed 
to the stoical school simon of athens and simmias of 
thebes were closer followers of socrates but the logical 
treatises in which they professed to methodise the system 
of their master have not come down to us 

plato wrote no treatise on the science and what he de 
livered must be collected from the body of his writings and 
his method of treating the subjects of the dialogues from 
these sources it appears that he had an adequate conception 
of the inverse methods of analysis and synthesis and wrote a 
work explanatory of their different properties which how 
ever has not come down to us in his philebus he prefers 
the latter method but in his written or exoteric works 
he constantly employed the other plato only discrimi 
nated two modes in which reason can be exercised viz 
that of departing from general principles to arrive through 
the medium of perception at the knowledge of individual 
facts and the mounting from these general principles with

out the aid of perception to reach a primary principle by 
which the different branches of knowledge are linked to 
gether and obtain a fixed and immutable character his 
a priori doctrine concerning ideas which he made the key 
stone of his system would not allow him to admit any species 
of inference to be legitimate from the particular to the 
general and compelled him to place the perfection of reason 
in resolving notions into all the qualities they bore and in 
seeking to educe from abstract propositions all the furniture 
of the universe he however contributed to keep alive 
among his countrymen that caution respecting the use of 
complex notions which socrates had introduced by tracing 
most of our errors to the vagueness and obscurity of 
this class of ideas and by viewing language simply as an 
instrument of thought which caprice as well as nature and 
analogy had conspired to form he impressed upon his fol 
lowers with no less force the necessity of defining all terms 
of a compound or abstract character before employing them 
in reasoning 

the treatises of aristotle which his greek as well as mo 
dern commentators have agreed to consider under the title of 
the organon as parts of one work embrace an exposition of 
every principle which concerns method truth the operations 
of the reasoning faculty and the foundations of evidence 
subjects which being widely distinct from pure metaphysics 
evidently show that aristotle had not that limited idea of 
the domains of the science within which some illustrious 
modern logicians would fain confine it aristotle regarded 
logic as the code of human reason but since ideas are the 
materials of the edifice it is called to construct the stagy 
rite deemed it expedient to commence the work with an in 
ventory of the immense number of conceptions with which 
the mind is furnished marshalling them in distinct rank and 
file that every notion may be found in its proper class and 
every class ranged under the head of its appropriate divi 
sion this portion which comprises the categories may be 
regarded as the frontierground where psychology is blended 
with logic where the one science terminates and the other 
begins

abistotle 

to combine the isolated elements expounded in the cate 
gories is the function of judgment which verbally expressed 
gives rise to propositions several propositions connected 
by certain laws constitute reasoning and the most simple 
form of it is that which unites two ideas by declaring 
their identity with a third through the medium of three pro 
positions termed the premises and the consequence hence 
the construction of the syllogism a greek word signifying 
this association of verbal judgments which aristotle follows 
out into all its developments and of whose legitimate forma 
tion he clearly enounced the rules the book of interpre 
tation comprising the second portion of the organon re 
lates to the exactitude of propositions the prior analytics 
which immediately succeeds expounds the law of the syllo 
gism its figures and modality 

the art of combining syllogisms in a compact chain of 
conclusive demonstrations aud the general principles of evi 
dence are taught in the posterior analytics the subjects 
of syllogistic probability and the laws of dispute so far as 
matters of opinion are concerned are laid down in the 
topics while the concluding section of the organon is 
employed about sophistical arguments or the means of de 
tecting error in syllogisms constructed in contravention of 
the laws of reasoning 

of the general doctrines of aristotle concerning the founda 
tions of evidence and the different scientific methods it may 
be sufficient to state that he regarded experience as the 
source from which the materials of each science must be 
drawn and pointed to induction as the proper mode of con 
structing general propositions out of the facts which it 
yields nevertheless he rather inconsistently refused to 
the intermediate axioms so derived any character of cer 
tainty until they had been applied by deduction to demon 
strate the existence of the particular facts out of which they 
had sprung his nominalism did not even lead him to deny 
the existence of universal axioms which derived their co 
gency from other sources than experience or hinder him 
from tracing our knowledge as much to the intrinsic percep 
tion of such principles and the consequences evolved out of 
them by deduction as to the recognition of simple facts and 
 de interpret c 



 historical intboduction 

the general laws to which they inductively led hence he 
clearly distinguished the two modes of knowledge mediate 
and immediate the former identified with proof the latter 
with first principles which he strongly insisted that no person 
could attempt to prove without landing himself in the belief 
of the impossibility of knowledge he also assigned a limit 
to definition as well as evidence and clearly shows that any 
effort to define simple terms must involve the logician in a 
vicious circle since it can only be achieved by words of a 
more complex character whose signification already has as 
sumed the object of the definition which is sought to be esta 
blished aristotle also distinguished the definition of names 
i e that which assigns any arbitrary meaning to a term 
otherwise indeterminate from the definition of things which 
he instructs the logician to express in terms of the nearest 
genus and most approximate difference if he would compare 
the thing defined with those which have most analogy with 
it and discriminate their common properties and several 
points of difference to define however is not to demon 
strate the object of definition being rather to serve as a 
basis of science by fixing the sense of terms to be employed 
in eliminating new truths than as a direct inlet to fresh 
knowledge 

we meet also in the same part of the organon a dis 
tinction between absolute and relative principles the first of 
which aristotle places in the nature of things being ex 
pressed in universal axioms and propositions the furthest 
removed from sense he assigns the latter to the judgments 
we make respecting individual facts vhich as they are 
mainly derived through sensation and are most proximate 
to sense are the first in the order of knowledge to this 
contrast he refers three others that of the universal and 
particular that of the necessary and contingent and that of 
the essence and accident absolute knowledge embraces 
the real essence of things which aristotle invested with the 
attribute of necessity relative knowledge comprises what is 
particular and contingent and every other property con 
nected in aristotles view with the accident of things the

first only admitting of demonstrative proof deserved the 
name of science the second as affording scope merely 
for the inductive method appertained solely to belief and 
opinion 

it is unfortunate that these distinctions should have been 
mainly founded upon a glaring error in the aristotelian 
physics viz that of attributing contingency and accident 
to what were simply isolated instances of general laws modi 
fied by peculiar circumstances as they led the stagyrite to 
divest one branch of proof of the certainty which belonged to 
it and thereby mainly contributed to disseminate those false 
ideas concerning induction which kept positive science sta 
tionary for nearly two thousand years if induction could 
only explore contingent events and if experience can only be 
consulted through its method it is evident that all the facts 
derived from this source must partake of uncertainty and that 
aristotle resolved all our knowledge into a principle which 
had no sufficient basis by what means demonstration con 
verted the facts to which it led into a certainty they could 
not possess even from the most compacted link of induc 
tive inference or how universal absolute and necessary pro 
positions can be identical with particular and contingent 
judgments derived from sense the stagyrite does not inform 
us and the organon is consequently transmitted to posterity 
with doctrines upon the applied part of logic which conflict 
with each other and convey with respect to the most fecund 
methods of introducing the empiric element into science the 
falsest impressions it is however fair to add that the greater 
portion of aristotles logical treatises has been lost and that 
those which have come down to us have not escaped the 
ravages of time and the mutilations of commentators 

with the exception of theophrastus and eudemus who 
extended the boundaries of the aristotelian logic by the in 
vention of the five moods and the important doctrine of hy 
potheticals we meet with no important writers on the 
science till the early centuries of the christian era in the 
intervening period the writings of aristotle seem to have 
been buried though the logical portion of them was tradi 
tionally handed down by his disciples and contributed to

 histoeical introduction 

guide the speculations of some of the roman sages in the 
second century however owing to their discovery by an 
dronicus of ehodes they met with a considerable revival 
and we find them the subject of many learned commenta 
ries by galen ammonius alexander and porphyry yet 
not one of these made any valuable accession to logic the 
labours of galen being confined to the discovery of the 
fourth figure and those of porphyry to his work on the pre 
dicables their writings however though unimportant in 
themselves were not unproductive in results they gave 
rise to a spirit of philosophic inquiry among the arabians 
when the thirst of conquest had subsided and by broaching 
the question of nominalism and realism among the maho 
metan and christian doctors led thought out of the stagnant 
flats in which five centuries of war and rapine had con 
fined it 

from the scholastics logic inherited a great abundance of 
acute distinctions which helped to disperse much of the con 
fusion apt to lurk in terms and propositions of a complex 
character but it is hard to say whether the waste of verbal 
subtleties with which they encumbered the science and their 

 this is the current opinion at oxford but it is fair to state that 
galen wrote a treatise on the art of demonstration which on the 
authority of hipp decreta ii cap ix cap had it reached us 
would have placed him in the rank of the most pioneering logicians 
of the present day galen is there represented as placing the radical 
vice of the ancients in seeking fecund propositions for science in abstract 
dialectics and in abusing general notions by substituting them for the 
light of facts and is made to define with surprising exactness the na 
ture of synthesis and analysis with their correlative methods point 
ing out the errors of relying on either of these methods to the exclu 
sion of the other and the necessity of combining both as the condition 
of perfect science de hipp et plat decret ix cap if we may 
believe these authorities he makes sense the criterion of simple 
objects the understanding those of complex and rational ones but sub 
sequently establishes the mutual dependence of these two channels of 
knowledge observation imparts the signs of things the understand 
ing abstract truths the first is the origin of discovery and leads to the 
decomposition of the principles of the sciences the second extends dis 
covery to new cases by demonstration and establishes the alliance of 
the facts so pointed out with empirical truths a union which alone 
constitutes perfect knowledge de optim sect c de cujusque 
animi prec cogn atque med c de optim docendi genere de 
hipp et plat decret vii ix galen traces the greater part 
of our errors to precipitate assimilation 



the scholastics 

constant use of the syllogism in its naked skeletonlike form 
did not counterbalance the advantages which undoubtedly 
sprung from the exactness of their terminology their want 
of elegance however in logical exposition must be traced to 
the slender resources which boethius translation afforded 
them to whom they were mainly indebted for their know 
lege of the organon while the entire absence of anything 
like physical science or experimental observation threw their 
minds upon abstract principles and a priori reasoning and 
may form some excuse for their devotion to pursuits in 
which the most gigantic intellects must have run to seed 
their logical works are multitudinous yet all wear the same 
aspect and teach the same doctrines unless in the solitary 
point about universals on which only they presumed to 
differ diligent bibliographers have been able to catalogue 
nearly two thousand treatises from this source all of which 
may be characterised as the bare formulising of the peripa 
tetic logic it is strange that men should have taken such 
pains to reecho what had been so often repeated before 
them but there were only two or three subjects upon 
which the mind could be employed viz metaphysics logic 
and theology and the religious uniformity of the age caused 
the same doctrines on these topics to be continually re 
produced 

as soon however as greek learning had been scattered 
over europe from the shrines of constantinople a spirit of 
disaffection at once manifested itself against the stagyrites 
supremacy and as his assailants deemed the organon the 
citadel of his empire they sought in destroying that to 
complete his overthrow their efforts do not appear to have 
ended in anything very decisive since they attacked the old 
logic entirely on false grounds and had nothing to set up in 
its place save some crude theories about method and the 
value of dichotomies nizolius flanks his attack on the 
organon with the strange assertion that correct reasoning 

 published at the commencement of the sixth century see 
blakeys logical catalogue even he has not mentioned half of them

encountered in looking over a formidable number at the cheetham and 
bodleian libraries de veris principiis et vera ratione philo 
sophandi ii c 



 histoeical nfteoduction 

consists in a clear and transparent diction and confounds 
persuasion with conviction in attributing to the flashes of the 
rhetorician the effects which can only follow from sound 
reasoning eamus who endorsed many of the views of 
nizolius affirmed with rather amusing gravity that he had 
studied the organon for ten years without becoming a better 
geographer or a wiser historian and proceeded to attack 
that treatise on the ground that it did not teach men facts 
tet the method of division by dichotomy which he at 
tempted to substitute for the peripatetic logic was simply 
an unnatural extension of the disjunctive syllogism whose 
functions the organon had already pointed out and which 
if practically enforced would have stunted the growth of 
reason by reducing the entire sphere of its operations to one 
of its least significant forms this substitution however 
does not appear to have been sufficiently absurd to lack 
supporters in more recent times its innovating character 
found strong favour with milton while condillac advocated 
it in his calcul and bentham in his chrestomathia 

the zeal with which eamus went about the demolition of 
the organon was frequently displayed at the sacrifice of 
consistency and the charges which he urged against its 
author if they had any weight would often rebound with 
much more force against himself he reproaches aristotle 
with his exclusive adoption of the analytic method and 
gives his preference to synthesis while his celebrated divi 
sions dichotomise are so many glaring instances of analysis 
his system received the name of the causal method not 
because it offers any instrument for the investigation of 
causes but because it places in causes a means of definition 
and one of the characters which determine the conformity of 
argument with things 

patrizzi and concio likewise became famous about the 
same era by their audacious attacks upon the stagyrite but

as the system they attempted to pull down patrizzi indeed 
gave bacon that magnificent hint about laying the foundations 
of philosophy entirely anew and erecting the fabric by the scaf 
folding of induction but his attempt at the task was converted 
by the platonic ideas he adopted into a ludicrous travesty of 
his own principles concios views of method were far more 
distinct and they are laid down with a particularity which 
shows that his conceptions grew out of a practical acquaintance 
with the modes by which the sciences might be moved out 
of the ruck in which they had so long been embedded in 
his work on the subject he places the problem of logic in 
determining the relation of the known to the unknown which 
may be distributed under different classifications that of the 
relation of the general to the particular of the whole to 
its parts of the compound to the simple of the cause to 
the effect or that of the reverse order of these divisions 
each development of these relations led him to distinguish 
three sorts of analysis not discriminated up to his time and 
subsequently confounded by condillac viz that which pro 
ceeds from the general to the particular from the whole to 
its parts and from the ends to the means they are how 
ever commonly united though one of them generally pre 
dominates in the same investigation of the three concio 
gives the preference to that which proceeds from the end to 
the means or from the effect to the cause and controverts 
the notion that analysis is the best instrument of discovery 
and synthesis the most available for the purposes of exposi 
tion according to concio the true method of instruction 
is to reveal the paths which led the discoverer to the truths 
we seek to explain for the rest in his definitions nomen 
clature and classifications he follows aristotle asserts with 
the stagyrite the illogical consequences of defining the first 
and last terms in the ladder of reasoning and like him pro 
pounds the general principles but failed to develope the 
theory of the combination of rational deductions with experi 
mental truths

to lose ground in proportion and a voice was heard from 
englands great chancellor arraigning the author on the 
charge of having corrupted science by an extravagant per 
version of logic bacon however in descending into the 
details of the impeachment did not evince any clear ideas of 
the points where aristotle had failed though he exhibited 
astounding ingenuity in unmasking the several causes which 
had impeded the progress of science and in constructing a 
system calculated to neutralise their effects in future the 
error of the stagyrite was hardly as bacon alleged in intro 
ducing a mode of reasoning compounded of propositions and 
middle terms which were liable to all the illusions of lan 
guage since no one can demonstrate without the aid of this 
method but in the assumption of metaphysical axioms and 
definitions untested by experience in conformity with which 
he attempted to prejudge every fact that nature presented 
against the errors which arose from the application of such 
principles bacon effectually provided by excluding every 
generalisation from the domain of philosophy which did not 
fairly arise out of the rigorous examination of the pheno 
mena it included and in framing a code of rules by which 
the mind might be led from particular facts to intermediate 
axioms and from these ascend to the universal laws which 
enchain the universe when general propositions were so 
reached through the medium of a legitimate induction 
bacon allowed the utility of the inverse method of demon 
strating the individual facts which these universal state 
ments included and tracing their remotest consequences 
by which we are led not only to the particular propositions 
by whose immediate consideration we rose to their dis 
covery but to others of which we had no previous know 
ledge 

hence it will appear that the doctrines of the two orga

that nature abhors a vacuum the abstract perfection of circular

nons are not so conflicting as is commonly reputed and that 
after abating some exaggeration of view on each side one 
may be fairly taken as supplementary to the other aris 
totle insists as well as bacon upon the necessity of blend 
ing abstract with experimental truths if we would attain to 
perfect science but both mistook the exact forms in which 
the combination should be effected one making induction 
the instrument of investigating truth the chief agent in 
the j formation of each science the other deduction which 
is more properly the means of demonstrating truth when 
discovered the error however lies only in the extreme 
length to which they pushed the two mutually corroborative 
poles of proof and would have disappeared had each only 
taken the pains to reconcile the discrepancies of their own 
statements on the subject bacon refused to take things 
as principles of evidence upon any other testimony than ex 
perience he nevertheless frequently admits the cogency of 
demonstrative laws which derive their force from abstract 
truths to discover facts which have not fallen under our ob 
servation aristotle while he resolves all our knowledge into 
experience strips induction the only method by which it 
can be consulted of every claim to certainty it does not 
appear to have occurred to either that abstract principles 
can only be combined with experimental truths through the 
blending of their correlative methods and that their respec 
tive functions must be employed according as each science 
admits of their influence to deny the relevancy of demon 
stration because the laws of induction have been legitimately 
propounded is as absurd as to impugn the utility of the wind 
mill because the steamengine has been invented and if 
aristotle and bacon have contributed to this error they have 
contradicted themselves as much as each other 

though bacons method has received no brilliant confir 
mations out of the circle of the experimental sciences he ex 
pressly urges its competency to meet all the purposes of 
scientific inquiry this statement however is only true so far 
as the introduction of the empiric element is concerned and 
the verificatory functions which it is only competent to dis 
charge where abstract evidence can be brought to the touch

stone of facts out of this sphere its application is unnatural 
and the attempt to obtrude it into ethical science has given 
birth to utilitarian chimeras as wild and fanciful in their way 
as those which arose from the unseasonable application of the 
countermethod to physics in general however abstracting 
from the zeal of one or two small philosophical sections who 
place each other out of the pale of reason the functions that 
the two organons are destined to fill have been practically as 
signed to them and their spheres kept perhaps even more 
distinct than is advantageous for science aristotle still rules 
over ethics hermeneutics and jurisprudence and as the master 
of scholastic divinity he yet contrives to mould the minds of 
those who sway the christian world but it is the distin 
guished prerogative of our immortal countryman to preside 
over the field of nature and teach man to unveil its secrets 
and subject its wildest elements to his will 

notwithstanding that the claims of the inductive method 
in all cases of appeal to facts had been urged before lord 
bacon and by none with more philosophical exactness than 
his great namesake he was the first to give them an ex 
tensive development and to announce them witli that spirit 
stirring eloquence which conspiring with the awakening 
thought of the age gained them a speedy entrance into the 
scientific mind of europe after the publication of the 
novum organon all logic seemed to be resolved into method 
and the success of that great work raised up rivals as well 
as imitators in that department of the science descautes 
would not admit that diversity of doctrines could be attri 
buted to any other cause than the diversity of modes pursued 
in their establishment and as he regarded mathematical 
proof as furnishing the highest gradation of certainty he 
endeavoured to raise a theory of method on the geometrical 
model and in its execution penetrated into some of the 
most subtle operations of thought in conformity with his 
general principle he was obliged to avow the homogeneous 
nature of all knowledge which he placed in the composition 
of known things and by not accepting anything as certain

but what immediate intuition or legitimate deduction reveals 
to limit induction to the functions of determining the state 
of a question of disengaging it from irrelevant matter and 
subdividing it into complete and consecutive categories all 
which operations descartes viewed with aristotle as so 
many preliminaries to demonstration hence he does not 
establish his series of truths by classes of facts gradually 
becoming more general and less complex in the ascent of 
proof but by chains of inference which derive their force 
from the most abstract laws of thought and here we meet 
with the great divergency of the two paths pursued by him 
and lord bacon 

evidence according to descartes is the result of the le 
gitimate exercise of all the operations of reason in the 
acquisition of knowledge induction and analysis prepare 
the way intuition commences but deduction completes the 
work in the pursuit of the latter branch we are led from 
words or abstract principles to things from the same to 
the same from the whole to its parts and vice versa or 
from the effect to the cause and inversely all his rules 
for the direction of the mind in these operations may be re 
duced to the following to submit our thoughts to the test 
of a rigid analysis removing all simple presumptions doubt 
ful opinions and obscure notions to examine if the thing 
to be determined spontaneously presents itself to us or 
whether it is known through the medium of another object 
and in the latter case to discover the class from which it is 
to be deduced for the rest every scientific question may 
be reduced to the solution of a mathematical problem since 
it encloses an unknown object which it is necessary to dis 
engage and explain by obtaining the sign and determining 
the conditions which belong to it descartes failed to dis 
criminate with sufficient precision the methods of analysis 
and synthesis misled by the error that they admitted of the 
same development in speculative philosophy as in geometry

 historical introduction 

he deemed his meditations an instance of analysis because 
they established the knowledge of god as a cause from the 
effect of his own existence notwithstanding his proof of the 
divine being is eminently synthetic in another portion of 
his works he attempted to establish his metaphysical system 
upon a synthetic basis but on comparing the two modes 
of procedure we find only a difference of arrangement in the 
compilation of the work and not a reverse order in the de 
velopment of the ideas 

with these principles it will be readily seen that descartes 
could admit no other criterion of truth than the logical 
axiom all that which is included in the idea of a thing may 
be affirmed of it he considered this principle competent to 
legitimise all inference and as he called his celebrated enthy 
meme i think therefore i am his generative principle 
or the cornerstone of the edifice he deemed his philosophical 
criterion the regulating line which determined the rectitude 
of the facts of which the structure was composed the dis 
crepancy however of limiting intuitive certainty to one me 
taphysical maxim and of assuming at the same time a logical 
axiom having no connexion with it as the test of the exten 
sion of that certainty to other truths he does not endeavour 
to explain or to show how a principle purely logical can 
be rationally applied to any objects out of the sphere of ab 
stract and conditional truth wishing to impose upon every 
science the same criterion of evidence and to unfold their 
truths by the same method he applies a maxim which can 
only regulate the interior combinations of our ideas to legiti 
mise the relation of real things in the objective world hence 
as far as natural science was concerned descartes wrecked 
his genius on those abstract principles which bacon had 
pointed out as the philosophical charybdis of antiquity by 
degrading induction from its legitimate functions and en 
deavouring to reason out natural facts by the a priori method 
his theories burst like soapbubbles almost as soon as they 
were formed while the system of bacon in the hands of the 
illustrious newton gave rise to a philosophy founded on the 
basis of observation and experience which will last so long as 
reason and the nature of things remain as they are

maeiotte and the poet eoyalists 

with the exception of a stray treatise or two like lord 
herberts de veritate tschirnhausens medicina mentis 
and spinosas de emendatione intellectus nothing of any 
importance appeared upon methodology after descartes but 
logic did not retire to its old limits without making some 
provision for the new processes of inference that had arisen 
and attempting to reconcile the operations of reason in the 
pursuit of the new sciences with the principles it had ap 
plied to the construction of the old mariotte was the first 
to extend the aristotelian logic by the introduction of ex 
perimental principles and to endeavour to bring all the 
operations of inference into harmony with each other by 
linking the increasing powers of the new calculus the laws 
of induction and demonstration to the same homogeneous 
axioms and definitions thus seeking to make logic stand to 
the other sciences as algebra to mathematics a supreme 
and universal science offering the key to the unknown in 
every department of knowledge and expounding all the 
methods by which truth can be sought out and demon 
strated 

a work of this kind though without aiming at so close an 
assimilation of the different methods of proof appeared in the 
port royal logic written by arnauld and jstichole with a 
view to bring the old organon in closer alliance with the 
cartesian philosophy the peripatetic logic however though 
not absolutely disparaged is considered of subordinate im 
portance to the rules of their master and the methods of 
geometry in the natural and speculative sciences and an 
examination of the sophisms apt to spring from selflove 
interest or passion in points of dispute is held out as far 
more likely to lead to the dissemination of truth and the 
overthrow of error than attention to the laws of quantifica 
tion or to the legitimacy of syllogistic moods the eight 
rules condensed from descartes intended by the authors to 
comprise the different methods to which the sciences owe 

 essai sur la logique printed at the end of the two volumes of 
his physical treatises first appeared in for a more detailed 
account of this work we must refer the reader to the introduction to

tlieir development are not so calculated to guide the mind to 
the discovery of truth as to fortify it from error a failure of 
design which arose from their absolute neglect of the induc 
tive element and the nonchalance with which they treated 
judgments of facts even this exclusive adherence to de 
monstration did not enable them to bring the new methods 
into harmony with the syllogysm or to promote anything 
like consilience of parts in the exposition of their doctrines 
they treated the old logic as a thing going out of fashion 
yet too respectable to be despised while their exclusion of 
the most powerful instrument of discovery left tlieir demon 
strative code much in the position of quixotes system of 
strategics which defined with the greatest precision the 
movements to be observed after the defeat of an enemy 
without throwing any light upon the mode by which that 
defeat was to be accomplished 

locke whose treatise immediately followed revived the 
old cry of the absolute worthlessness of the aristotelian 
syllogism even in matters of speculative reasoning where 
bacon had confessed its power and seemed inclined with 
eainus to limit the functions of reason to correct definition 
and methodical analysis beyond these preliminaries to 
demonstration he refused to acknowledge the efficiency of 
any rules for the guidance of the judgment and assimi 
lated like descartes moral proof to mathematical in 
ference that the consequence might follow from the correct 
statement of the conditions of the question in determining 
the origin of our simple ideas the growth of their complex 
forms the reality of knowledge which he made to consist in 
the conformity of words with things the use and abuse of 
language and the nature of truth which he placed in the 
conjunction and separation of signs according as the things 
they denote agree or differ locke found a field better 
adapted for his keen analytic powers than the regions of 
pure logic in which through his inability to demonstrate 
he was peculiarly unfitted to move but the attempt of the 
essay on the understanding to carry the inductive method 
into psychology is not without its uses to the logician it 
accustoms him to analyse his notions with rigorous precision 
to provide against the errors of popular phraseology and dis 
perse the equivocations apt to cluster round certain forms of 



locke and condillac 

expression it is wrong however to confront it with logic 
or include it in the same category it only takes us to the 
threshold of the science and leaves us there 

condillac gave a more explicit development to the views 
of locke by resolving the elements of all kinds of reasoning 
into the mathematical principle that the same is the same 
thus referring all truth to identity of ideas and reducing the 
artifice of reasoning to the mere transformation of signs 
between propositions brought into relations of equality 
hence as algebraical forms constituted the only laws to be 
observed in the process of inference the functions of logic 
were restricted to definition the syllogism was treated as a 
joke and the highest results of reasoning in any walk of 
science deemed of no further utility than the formation of a 
philosophical language as aristotle delighted in contrasts 
condillac was singularly enamoured of unity and simplified 
everything according to him there was only one criterion 
of certainty one method of proof only one order of analysis 
and one source of error his unique analysis consists 
merely of a method of division already laid down by des 
cartes the specific object of which was to make a complete 
inventory of all the parts which constitute a whole his 
sole fount of error is the employment of words without de 
termining the ideas they are intended to convey 

the principal merit of condillac consists in his clear expo 
sition of the principles which lead to the legitimate alliance 
between abstract truths and judgments of fact but this 
portion of his work stands out in strong antagonism with 
the rest of his logical theory which reduces all propositions 
to abstract and rational judgments and makes their identity 
constitute the foundations of science the consequences of 
such a principle in psychology demonstrate its illogical 
nature and would land condillac in opinions quite opposite

 histobical introduction 

to those which he strove to establish and which he ia com 
monly supposed to represent if all science is limited to the 
identity of our ideas compared with each other irrespective 
of inductive evidence we surely can know nothing of the re 
lation of our ideas to things we enclose ourselves in a 
circle of idealism and place a gulf between our knowledge 
and the external world which no logic can bridge over 

against the extreme doctrines of descartes and locke 
there had been a strong reaction in germany headed by 
leibnitz but its logical bearings were not formally ex 
pounded before wolf issued his great encyclopaedia of the 
sciences the views of this eclectic are similar to those 
already attributed to mariotte being an attempt to combine 
all that was sound in the old and new organons and methods 
and vindicating for logic its natural position as a sort of 
propadeutic to all the sciences that knowledge might rest on 
consistent principles and a termination be put to many irre 
levant disputes in philosophy to this end wolf sought to 
shed a new light on the maxims of descartes of locke and 
leibnitz and to reconcile many of their statements with 
respect to the character of clear and confused adequate and 
inadequate ideas by introducing a distinction between the 
formal qualities with which the mind is apt to clothe its con 
ceptions and the material qualities which arise solely from 
the nature of the objects themselves this distinction forms 
the basis of the two branches of his logic formal conceptions 
being connected through abstract principles with demonstra 
tive reasoning while those of a material character are allied 
with experience and give rise to the functions of induction 
the principle of causality is the guide of the second the ne 
gative process that of the first he attempts to reconcile the 
discrepancies of aristotle between these two orders of truths 
by showing how universal propositions are connected with 
particulars by the scaffolding of inductive inference which 
bacon had designed though wolf failed to unite the two 
methods under one criterion of evidence the intuitive 

 wolf published in a small treatise on logic under the title

wolf and his german successobs 

judgments which underlie each mode of proof are distin 
guished with sufficient clearness the several uses of hypo 
thesis determined and the laws of causality traced out with 
the practised eye of a metaphysician 

notwithstanding the completeness simplicity and preci 
sion of these views wolf has been charged with investing 
simple truths with all the pomp of demonstration and with 
converting the proof of ordinary facts into theorems of geo 
metry but these attempts arose from a desire to bring the 
complex parts of his treatise into logical symmetry by con 
necting them with rational criteria and by making the in 
ductive and demonstrative methods coalesce and verify each 
other as much as possible in furtherance of the same sim 
plification wolf had asserted the homogeneous character of 
the speculative and mathematical branches of deduction sup 
posing that as the whole series of geometrical proof could be 
drawn out in syllogistic array to which indeed he attributed 
their cogency so the whole chain of philosophical inference 
admitted of the same rigorous precision as those of quantity 
a statement which was subsequently challenged by eudiger 
on the ground that mathematics embraced probability but 
philosophy the transition from the possible to the real 

among the opponents or followers of wolf we meet with 
few marked contributors to logical science till the time of 
lambert eudiger introduced the logic of analogy so much 
neglected by the moderns and entirely passed over by the 
ancients and walch pointed out the extensive application 
it might receive in the various branches of the moral and 
natural sciences crousaz who wrote his treatise on the 
principles of bacon and locke contributed an excellent 
chapter on probability and on causality in which he at 
tempted to rectify the peripatetic classification by substi 
tuting an exact category of all the relations to which the

word cause may be applied with their respective distinctions 
putting forth similar views of the science to crousaz pere 
regnault made a successful attempt to popularise logic by 
expounding it in a conversational form his book written 
in a clear and sketchy manner in imitation of fontenelle 
was issued in a spirit of compromise being an attempt to 
reconcile the old notions on logic with the empiric principles 
that domineered over his age 

but the most important accession to logic at this epoch 
was the introduction of a scheme of notation calculated to 
reduce its method to algebraic simplicity an improvement 
which grew out of the ancient constitution of the science and 
destined to be prolific in great results aristotle had con 
ceived that the combinations of abstract ideas in reasoning 
might be reduced to a certain number of formulas and that 
ideas might be distributed into certain classes hence 
sprung his rules for the syllogism his categories and com 
monplaces in the middle age raymond tally had founded 
his combinatorial art on the development and abuse of this 
great conception wilkins athanasius kircher and dal 
garno flattered themselves they were possessed of the power 
to represent the entire system of our ideas in a language 
competent to produce all their analogies an attempt was 
now made to apply the same notion to logic by giving that 
science the form of mathematical calculation and investing 
it with the rigour of its methods 

with this view plouquet introduced and lambert per 
fected a system of particular signs directed to express the 
logical relations of ideas following locke lambert first 
endeavoured to determine the signs of the relations of simple 
ideas and left those of the complex ones to be determined

knowledge can be reduced the latter fixing the general notions which

power proportionate to the extension of the distinguishing 
difference and those of opposition of analogy of quantity 
and quality of the known to the unknown are expressed by 
other marks analogous to those of algebra as there are in 
logic simple as well as compound relations this theory has 
its corresponding proportions and progressions and assigns 
to logic its series and limits as well as to the higher algebra 
but the greater part of the notation lies open to all the 
objections urged against investing matters of moral specula 
tion with the rigorous precision of quantity and has in fact 
remained unenforced unless by one or two stray logicians 
who like condillac made the homogeneity of the two classes 
of truths the groundwork of their system the scheme how 
ever led euler to devise a system of figures solely re 
stricted to represent the logical relations of our conceptions 
apart from any assumptions of particular doctrines and pre 
pared the way for sir william hamiltons mode of notation 
which by enabling us to render the equivalent and con 
vertible syllogisms in the different figures at a glance accord 
ing to extension or intention has simplified all the relations 
of pure logic and would form were it not narrowed to a 
particular system one of the most important features in its 
progress 

since the fall of the wolfian system and the inaugura 
tion of a popular literature in germany logic has gradually 
subsided in that country into a history of dreams even

the importance of maintaining the independence of their art 
bound it up to a great extent with empiric psychology 
while more audacious thinkers have confounded its axioms 
and rules with a mass of metaphysical hypotheses framed for 
no other purpose than the invention of argument to contra 
dict common sense yet with a view to clearness and pro 
priety of thought it is evidently necessary that every science 
should be treated strictly on its own grounds and most 
scrupulously distinguished from the sciences which lie upon 
its confines while it is no less essential to the progress of 
knowledge that those mental phenomena which admit of irre 
fragable proof and stand upon a certain foundation should 
be separated from a heap of supposititious paradoxes whose 
leading object appears to be to deny what is and to prove 
what is not kant felt the truth of these views and in his 
new philosophy assigned to logic its old limits but his suc 
cessors have found in his doctrines principles which impugn 
this division and their final development by hegel has ter 
minated in a position which tears up the old logic by the 
roots introducing as the criterion of truth the very tenet that 
it upheld as the test of falsity 

in italy a few excellent treatises have appeared on the 
science within the last hundred years among which the works 
of genovesi and galluppi stand conspicuous for complete 
ness precision and exactitude though they follow wolf 
in applying the mathematical methods to the speculative 
sciences they do not invest them with the same degree of 
certainty but as evidence admits three classes of truths

the introduction is longer than the entire work and contains little 
worthy of remark beyond some formal distinctions principally de 
signed to separate pure from applied logic it is idle to attempt 
to refute a man who assumes the livery of falsehood as the badge of 
truth and who asserts that when you have involved him in a contra 
diction you have only established the truth of his principles it would 
appear that hegels wissenschaft der logik screens itself by such an 
assumption from any attack on the part of the old and that there 
requires a logic absolutely superior to both to decide the controversy

as the views of the principal english logicians of the 
present century are discussed in the body of this work we 
need not here go further into detail than to point out their 
general features and show the different aspects which the 
science assumes from their embodiment at the commence 
ment of this era logic which had restricted itself to the 
scholastic garb was fast declining as a study not less owing 
to the sweeping censures of brown and dugald stewart 
than to the blighting railleries of our comic dramatists and 
the feeble talents of its own expositors kett belsham 
and kirwan only repeated what had been said as well if 

 galluppi adds memory and evidence but subsequently resolves 
memory into an auxiliary agent of the others evidence is plainly no 
faculty but simply the result of the legitimate exercise of the mental 
faculties in reasoning a the most methodical treatise of this class 
and surpassing all others in the completeness of its views is one by

son and others and it appeared that the aristotelian form 
of the science was on the point of being restricted to scien 
tific theology had not an advocate of colossal dimensions 
archbishop whately stood forward to reassert its em 
pire and answer the scotch professors with arguments 
quite as striking as any which they had urged the work 
achieved its object a host of treatises appeared more or 
less embodying its principles two or three of course in 
the natural order of things venturing on a condemnation 
and the science experienced a revival which has during the 
interval of a quarter of a century manifested no signs of 
abatement 

the great object of dr whately is to extricate logic from 
the false views with which it had been connected and defend 
and expound its doctrines according to the limits assigned to 
it by the scholastic divines with regard to method in the 
cartesian sense or to the trains of thought which have led 
philosophers to grasp the highest axioms of science logic 
has nothing whatever to do it simply confines itself to 
analyse and determine the reasoning process so far as it is a 
verbal operation beyond this dr whately will not admit 
the possibility of an abstract science of evidence the field 
being too large and multifarious to permit the methods pur 
sued in each science to be succinctly generalised hence if 
a reader wish to have any idea of the processes by which the 
mind is led to attain truth or to appreciate their relative 
force he has no other resource than to attack with leibnitz 
the entire group of the sciences and familiarise himself with 
the encyclopaedia of knowledge of the general theory of 
inference he can know no more than what aristotle told him 
some two thousand years ago when reason had made but a few 
illdigested efforts to explain mans position in this world 

 among the former may be mentioned hinds introduction to

and when its highest results were to be found in the victories 
of the sophist it is evident such a statement must be 
received with caution had dr whately confined his re 
marks to those who confounded metaphysical discussions 
mnemonic aids and educational suggestions with the science 
of inference his censures would have been as applicable as 
they are forcible but to strike at those who claim for logic 
the analysis of all the methods of inference which reason 
employs in the investigation of truth and limit the science 
to that part of it which the deductive syllogism involves is 
arresting generalisation in logic at a stage when it was mani 
festly impossible that it could be otherwise than imperfect 
even the a priori forms of the logical faculty cannot be cor 
rectly analysed without a distinct reference to the tangible 
facts about which they are employed and when aristotle 
wrote physical science was a blank and law and theology 
were unborn 

an attempt has been made to supply a logic embodying 
the leading forms of inference pursued in the chief depart 
ments of science by john stewart mill whose treatise is 
perhaps the only one which presents an adequate concep 
tion of the science were it not for the ultra nominalist 
theories of the author and his disposition to regard material 
objects as the only things to which real inference can be 
applied his work we doubt not would have been one of 
the most perfect expositions that logic as the science of 
inference could have received at the present day he sees 
distinctly through his subject exhibits compact and con 
secutive thought in harmonising its various details and 
withdraws the mind from too much attention to empty 
formulas and trifling distinctions which is the bane of the 
peripatetic logic and fixes it on the realities of nature 
in expounding the theory of induction which he makes the 

 in proof we refer the reader to aristotles theory of induction 
 we regret in addition he should have referred his readers to 
scholastic logicians for an exposition of the laws of the syllogism and 
taken up much valuable space with frivolous metaphysical disputes 
with whewel in which his arguments only go to prove that he is on 
the wrong side mill will not admit there is such a thing as in 
ference in law and theology but only interpretation

basis of inference ratiocination being in his view a de 
pendent and subsidiary process he takes the laws of the 
material world as a sort of middle term by which the methods 
pursued in all the sciences may be presented even to the 
uninitiated in a general and perspicuous form and considers 
these laws under every point of view in which they are 
capable of shedding new light upon the processes of science 
the result is a masterly analysis of the logic of the physical 
sciences in the spirit of lord bacon whose chief merit it 
was to commence the undertaking in supplying the very 
gap which bacon pointed out mr mills treatise has placed 
logic on its legitimate foundations and constitutes an era in 
the science destined to be of paramount influence over future 
times 

the newest phase however which logic has assumed in 
the present century is that which arises from a thorough 
going quantification of the predicate which sir w hamilton 
ventures to think will remove many cumbrous forms that 
now clog the peripatectic development of the abstract law of 
reasoning and both simplify and extend its general results 
though this distinguished metaphysician has not yet com 
municated his views to the public a general outline of them 
has appeared from the pen of spencer baynes in the shape 
of a prize essay which sir william hamilton who proposed 
the subject to his pupils has endorsed with his sanction 
we are unable however to see from mr bayness state 
ment of his views that the proposed alterations will effect 
any improvement in this branch of the science so far as 
practical utility is concerned however serviceable such 
emendations may be in simplifying the abstract statement of 
the laws of thought our reasons will be found in the parts 
of the treatise which the complete quantification of the pre 
dicate would modify where sir w hamiltons opinions are 
noticed in detail de morgans treatise which deserves 
honourable mention for its list of privative judgments em 
bodies we believe most of sir w hamiltons views on pure 
logic but the mathematical mnemonics which run through

mans ed had started but did not continue the subject

the whole of it will ever tend to render it a sealed book to 
those not over enthusiastic about algebraic symbolism 
mr thompsons laws of thought is avowedly written to 
introduce the alterations proposed by a complete quantifica 
tion of the predicate in a popular treatise on logic but 
the author by no means adopts the entire doctrines of the 
illustrious edinburgh professor he ventures to think that 
many of the new syllogistic moods in his system are useless 
and nugatory to a clear exposition of pure logic thomp 
son subjoins an analysis of the scientific processes which con 
stitute the mixed branch of the science but in too isolated a 
manner the work is lucidly written and forms an in 
valuable accession to the literature of logic 

notwithstanding the success of these efforts the age has 
not been without impugners of the peripatectic system who 
with brown and locke would tear it up root and branch and 
hardly leave a single vestige of it in the science of inference 
though their objections are strikingly stated we meet with 
nothing of a very novel character in their works nor do we 
think the reasons adduced at all likely to shake the empire 
of the stagyrite so long as that is confined to its strict 
domain

all reasoning is founded upon judgments and these can 
only be employed about the minds conceptions of things 
which enunciated in language are called terms hence 
logic at the outset concerns itself with the formation of 
and verbal expression of conceptions so far as these opera 
tions concur to the deduction of correct inference this 
limit we conceive may be as easily drawn as that which 
marks the boundaries of any other science in the group of 
those which have language as a subjectmatter in common 
if it is obvious that grammar has to deal with terms only as 
they concern correct speaking and rhetoric only as the em 
ployment of them is calculated to excite certain emotions it 
is no less obvious that in logic we must restrict ourselves to 
that view of them which concerns the operations of the mind 
in correct reasoning and the part they play in the process to 
attain this object two things are manifestly requisite first 
to trace the results of the diiferent processes of thought to 
which objects must be subjected before their relations of 
agreement or disagreement to each other can be adequately 
ascertained the second to examine the process by which 
notions and signs become the representatives of these objects 
with a view to discover how far and under what sense the 
abstractions and names with which they axe clothed may be 
relied upon as a correct designation of the properties which 
they imply these two heads cover the entire ground of the 
aristotelian and baconian analysis of terms and will if fully 
developed exhaust the subject the first is intended to ex 
plain all that relates to conceptions with regard to their form 
while the second will comprise everything which has reference 
to their matter the prior member of the division naturally 
resolves itself into material and formal relation the first of 
which will form the opening chapter

 conditions of conception substance attribute 

it is clear that the mind can form no distinct conception 
of an object without ascribing to it some property or with 
out receiving an impression of its existence in some mode or 
manner the object which is thus supposed to exist by 
itself is denominated substance the property assigned to it is 
called its attribute thus in the proposition that stone is 
flinty we assign the mode or attribute of flintiness to the 
substance stone and not unfrequently condense both into 
one expression as a flinty stone 

the names of objects were denominated by the schoolmen 
substantive or absolute the names which represent things 
as modified for example round hard just prudent as con 
notatives from the latin word connotare to mark along 
with because while they point out distinctly the mode they 
also denote the subject in which it inheres this designa 
tion is of great use in keeping in view the distinction be 
tween the names which simply denote objects without any 
reference to their attributes such as proper names and those 
which imply along with them denotation or marking out of 
the object the attributes with which it is invested 

all attributes are either adjectives or substantives gene 
ralised from them as human or humanity corporeal cor 
poreality rational rationality and necessarily imply rela 
tion to some substance of which they are the mode this 
relation may be either essential or accidental that is con 
tingent an essential attribute enters so far into our idea 
of the substance to which it refers that we cannot conceive 
it to exist without incorporation with it in this manner 
rotundity is essential to a circle rationality to man and four 
sidedness to a square since these notions invest them with 
the properties that constitute their being a contingent

attribute may on the other hand as the term imports exist 
apart from the substance to which it implies relation be 
cause many men are found black it cannot be inferred that 
any particular colour enters into our conception of humanity 

 abstract and concrete connotative and nonconno 
tative terms 

when the mind embodies the attribute in a subject the 
notion thus definitely limited is called concrete when it 
views the attribute in a substantive form apart from the 
object the term is called abstract thus when the property 
of wisdom is considered with reference to man we get the 
concrete sage but if we generalise the term wise and 
view it without reference to the object it denotes we obtain 
its abstract wisdom all general names however since 
the time of locke have been denominated abstract and 
common usage has conventionalised the expression but the 
term was employed by the schoolmen solely to designate 
that large section of words which substantise attributes and 
to that sense it ought to be restricted hence as abstract 
terms generally refer to one special property as whiteness 
rotundity or smoothness they are designated nonconnota 
tive since they do not imply any object beyond it 

substances may be said to be singular when the mind 
employs itself about any one definitely as this tree that 

 the distinction between mode and substance is not as the port 
koyal logic asserts that the true mode cannot be conceived apart from 
its relationship with the substance which it implies while the substance 
can for when that relation is essential the substance can no more be 
conceived without it than the attribute the clear distinction between 
attribute and substance is fundamental to correct reasoning but it 
appears to us to lie in the discrimination of one property from a 
congeries of properties the former of which always finds expression 
in an adjective form or as a substantive generalised from an adjective 
 hence abstract words generally are not capable of being pluralised 
while all concrete are a principle which led the greeks to adopt the 
very elegant contrivance of using the same word to denote the general 
idea while they marked the abstract or concrete character it bore by 
a simple alteration of the number the plural of an abstract noun 
being used for the singular of a concrete for instance rfw is the 
abstract term for art revai the concrete designation of the par 
ticular exercise of the art see esch agam

house or when the thing actually existing stands apart by 
itself as the city of london the university of durham 
they are denominated general or common when they are 
viewed in connexion with the class to which they belong as 
tree city university c it may be necessary to distinguish 
general from collective terms the former can be predi 
cated of each individual of a multitude a collective name 
cannot be predicated of each separately but only of all taken 
together thus kellermans division of infantry could not 
be predicated of every individual who composed it but only 
of the collective body such a term is considered as a single 
collective name but if we mention a division of infantry 
without reference to any special one the name must be con 
sidered as general and collective 

all concrete general terms are connotative the word 
man for instance denotes an indefinite number of indi 
viduals of whom taken as a class it is the name but it is 
applied to them because they possess certain attributes as 
animal life corporeity rationality and a certain external 
form which is called human every existing being which 
possessed these attributes would be called a man but none 
could be so denominated that wanted any of these qualities 
if a race of animals were discovered like swifts houyhnhms 
possessing reason equal to human beings but invested with 
another corporeal form some other name than that of man 
would be required for their denotation on the other hand 
most singular names are nonconnotative since they denote 
the individual objects to which they are applied without im 
plying any attribute in connexion with them for example 
when we call a boy edward or name a girl clotilda it 
is simply to enable these individuals to be distinguished from 
their kind without awakening in the mind any impressions 
concerning their attributes 

 relative and absolute positive and negative terms 

when the mind considers any object as connected in any 
way with another the term in which it is expressed is called 
relative such are father son ruler subject cause effect 
and those various degrees of comparison by which subjects 

d 



 eelation teems to each othee b i 

are contrasted together as like unlike longer shorter c 
absolute terms are those which express the object inde 
pendent of such relation as man house animal when 
two objects which are pairs are viewed in reference to the 
relation they hold to each other the terms in which they 
are expressed are denominated correlative thus though a 
king is the ruler of men king and man are not correlative 
but king and subject are 

when the mind attributes any definite property to a sub 
ject the mode so assigned is termed positive as a man 
reasoning if the term denote that such a quality might be 
conceived to exist in the subject but does not the attribute is 
called privative as dumbness a man who is silent a blind 
child if the mode is inconsistent with the subject of which 
it is predicated it is then called negative as a dumb picture 
a lifeless statue we may notice however that attributes 
are often positive in form while they are negative in reality 
thus the words idle or sober though positive in form 
merely connote the absence of activity and drunkenness 
some terms on the other hand conceal a positive attribute 
under a negative form as truthlessness does not express the 
mere absence of truth but the positive attribute of lying 

notions are said to be contradictory when they completely 
exhaust all nameable things as animate and inanimate cor 
poreal and incorporeal organised and unorganised for it is 
impossible that one or other should not belong to every 
object as there is nothing that can be both so there is 
nothing that can be neither on the other hand contrary 
notions are those which cannot be predicated of the same 
subject at the same time though there are many subjects to 
which they do not apply at all and others to which they are 
applicable at different times nothing can be at once dis 
creet and imprudent but a man may be so at different 
epochs of his life while a tree can never be deemed either

 generalisation and abstraction 

the principal act by which the mind arrives at the various 
conceptions we have enumerated is abstraction by this 
faculty we can divide substance into its logical parts viz 
subject and attributes and restrict our attention to any 
definite mode apart from the subject in which it is supposed 
to inhere this is clearly evinced by geometricians who in 
treating their science do not as is the vulgar opinion sup 
pose that there are lines without breadth or surfaces without 
depth but simply that they are able to consider length apart 
from breadth which is even competent to the peasant when 
he measures the distance from one town to another 

it is obvious that by the same faculty we can detach our 
mind from the accidental properties of a subject and consider 
its essential attributes alone as in the case of a human 
being we may withdraw our thoughts from his individual 
peculiarities as height complexion colour of hair c 
and attend solely to those qualities which enter into the 
essentiality of his being as a particular form of corporeity 
endued with reason and animal life in the same manner 
when we draw a triangle on paper we are able by an 
instantaneous process of thought to withdraw our attention 
from the place where it is and the other accidents which 
determine it and consider the diagram as a figure bounded 
by three right lines we thus obtain a conception which 
applies to all triangles indiscriminately as in the former 
example we obtained a conception which included under it 
all members of the human family by fixing the results of 
these processes of thought in permanent language as man 
triangle animal we obtain the terms we have already de 
signated common from being applicable to all the indivi 
duals included under them alike and which are sometimes 
called predicables because they can be predicated of each 
affirmatively

 genus and species 

by this process of generalisation the mind is enabled to 
dilate or contract its view of objects to an extent only limited 
by the boundaries of human intelligence we may by ab 
stracting from or adding to any conception within the range 
of actual existence proceed through the varied scale of being 
till we reach the highest or lowest link it opens out to 
us thus by observing a particular horse bucephalus 
grazing with others in the same field and abstracting the es 
sential qualities of the group from those which are merely 
accidental as colour size age c we get the common 
notion of horse if again we contrast the notion of horse 
with cow wolf tigress we observe that they have one 
property in common viz that of suckling their young 
and abstracting this from the other qualities in which 
they differ we form the wider conception of mammalia car 
rying the process still further we may compare the mam 
malia with birds fishes insects and worms whence per 
ceiving that all these however different agree in connoting 
corporeal life and sensation we arrive at the wider conception 
animal which embraces all material living things in the 
same manner animal may be considered in relation to inani 
mate objects when the abstraction of life and sensation will 
leave us the residuum of corporeal substance common to 
both another step will lead us to the most general con 
ception the mind is capable of forming viz that of being 
as synonymous with substance i e a substratum in which 
certain properties inhere the mind in its view of objects 
ranges with equal freedom through the descending and 
upward series and by bringing any two notions into the 
scale can ascertain their definite relation to each other 
thus the notion animal connotes distinct qualities in which 
mammalia and insects equally participate it can therefore 
be predicated of both but mammalia and insects though 
included in one compact term designate different attributes 
in the kinds which they represent and on that account reci 
procally exclude each other 

when a notion is considered as included in one more 
general it is called a species and the containing term in con 
nexion with it is denominated genus thus body and mind 



c h formal eelation 

are contained in the notion of substance as rhinoceros and 
elephant in that of animal they are therefore species of 
which substance and animal are the genera things which 
are species to one genus may be respectively genus and 
species when viewed in relation to each other thus man 
and animal are species with reference to substance but 
animal is the genus of man who in turn is a species of 
animal species however of the same genus which mutually 
exclude each other are denominated coordinate species as 
mammalia and insects are the coordinate species of animal 
in like manner the same notion may be a genus when com 
pared with the things to which it extends and a species 
when compared to another term which is more general 
thus body which is a genus in respect of organised and 
unorganised things is a species in relation to substance and 
quadrilateral which is a genus with reference to parallelogram 
and trapezium is a species in relation to figure such terms 
as are respectively genus and species according to the light 
in which they are viewed are called subaltern genera or 
species there are however species which cannot become 
genera as circle includes only individual circles which are all 
of the same species these are termed infirma species of 
which there are many kinds but there can only be one 
absolute genus summum genus which is not a species 
whether we choose to call it being or substance is a point 
for metaphysical rather than for logical discrimination 

 differentia property and accident 

but besides genera and species which being the results 
of the general ideas that represent their objects to us as 
things or modes of things denoted by substantives there 
are a class of notions formed by the abstracting power of the 
mind that have reference to objects as things modified and 
are generally expressed by adjective or connotative terms 
these when compared with the substances to which they re 
late will fall under the head of difference property or acci 
dent 

when we divide a genus into its species as animal into 
horse bird or man c we have regard to some essential 
attribute which not only distinguish them from their com 



 belation of teems to each otheb b i 

mon genus but separate them from each other without 
such attribute it is evident the species would be confounded 
with the genus and with each other eor example body 
and mind are two species of substance but we are only led 
to conceive them such because body though included in sub 
stance is distinguished from it by an attribute which sub 
stance does not connote viz that of extension and mind 
by that of thought which attributes in turn serve to 
separate the species from each other now such essential 
attribute whatever it be that leads us to discriminate the 
species from the genus is called as the sense implies its dif 
ference hence the genus with its difference makes up our 
idea of species thus metalwire endued with polarity con 
stitutes a magnet so that the species includes all the attri 
butes of the genus just as the genus includes all the subjects 
of the species or to take a plainer instance man is a 
responsible animal the term animal genus includes every 
kind of organised being endowed with sensation among 
which man finds a place while the term man species in 
cludes all the qualities of freewill and reason combined with 
material agency in which the attributes of the genus viz 
organised and percipient sensation necessarily are com 
prised 

the species however may be distinguished from the genus 
by other essential attributes besides that which constitutes 
the difference and which as the difference is generally the 
leading quality is often implied in or dependent upon it 
thus extension is the differentia of matter but in examin 
ing the nature of extension we find it connotes divisibility 
hence we call this quality a property of matter occa 
sionady however a property may be something distinct from 
the differentia that is not implied in it as it is an essential 
quality of a triangle that its three angles be equal to two 
right angles but this property is not implied in the dif 
ferentia which distinguishes a triangle from other figures 
viz three straight lines which enclose a space hence pro 

 difference does not occupy a distinct place among the predicables 
of aristotle though it may be inferred from his category see organ 
top ch iv the division of predicables in the text was first fully 
drawn out from his topics by porphyry 



c h foemal belatiojt 

perty may be taken to be such essential attribute of the 
species as is not employed for its differentia 

since the difference and property of a species must be 
essential to our conception of any of the individuals included 
under its class it is evident that their universality must be 
coextensive with it they are therefore creations which 
depend as much upon the minds generalising faculty as 
genera and species and are not improperly included with them 
in the same category it should however be observed 
as the mind is generally led to adopt that attribute as 
the differentia which is most important to the end it has in 
view that which may constitute the property of a species 
with one may form its differentia with another thus in 
naval science the polarity of the magnet is the quality which 
would be viewed as the differentia while by those who 
employ magnets for more expeditiously picking up bits of 
iron this might be regarded as a property but the attracting 
power of the magnet would constitute the differentia 

any quality that does not enter into our conception of the 
essence of a species but may be absent or present that 
species continuing the same is called an accident of the 
species thus a man may be walking or he may be a ma 
hommetan of these two examples the former is called a 
separable accident because it may be separated from the in 
dividual and the latter inseparable for a contrary reason 
every accident however must be separable from the species 
otherwise it would be a property 

it is very important here to observe that no term can be 
determined to belong to any of these five universal predi 
cables unless it be specified of what it is to be predicated 
for example the term red would be considered a species 
with regard to colour a genus in relation to the terms 
 pink scarlet c it might be regarded as the dif 
ferentia of red rose as a property of blood and as an 
accident of a house thus the power of resisting oxidi 
sation is an accident in reference to the term metal but it is 
a property of gold and several other metals and hence we 
may infer that in all cases the differences or properties of 
any lower species will be accidents in reference to the higher 
class in which they are comprised

 extension and intension 

by examining the relations which genus and species bear to 
each other and the different natures of the wholes by which 
one is said to be included in the other we shall distinguish 
a very important law of abstraction it is evident we 
cannot detach any properties from a notion without extend 
ing the list of objects to which it is applied thus if we 
abstract from a rose those peculiar properties which consti 
tute its essence and attend solely to those which it connotes 
as a plant we extend its application before limited to 
flowers with red petals to the oak fir lichen geranium and 
a countless variety of others this view of a conception re 
stricted solely to the number of objects it denotes is called 
its extension but in proportion as we extend the applica 
tion of a notion to denote a greater number of objects the 
notion must necessarily comprehend fewer properties as in 
extending rose to plant we dropped petals leaves stamina 
and pistals for vegetable growth the only property we can 
assign to plant but as we narrow the sphere of a notion 
the qualities which it comprehends proportionably increase 
as in restricting the term body to animal we are obliged to 
endue it with the qualities of life and sensation and if we 
still further narrow it to man we must comprehend reason 
in the list this view of a conception in relation to the 
properties it connotes is called its comprehension 

hence the comprehension of a notion is always in the in 
verse ratio of its extension the maximum of the one being 
necessarily the minimum of the other this arises from the 
different nature of the counter wholes which these quantities 
represent the one comprising an assemblage of attributes 
the other of objects the one a concrete the other an abstract 
whole thus in the individual when the greatest number of 
attributes is united comprehension is at its maximum and 
extension at its minimum while in the most abstract notion 
the mind can form viz that of being extension is at its 
maximum and comprehension necessarily at its minimum 
since it only connotes the single attribute of existence

in a general term or in other words when we state in full 
all the objects which such term denotes we are said to sub 
ject it to a logical division such a process is in fact identi 
cal with the statement of a conception in terms of its exten 
sion 

dr whately with all deference to such high authority 
confounds as it seems to us the operation of narrowing a 
term to certain attributes with the statement of the objects 
which are included under it in calling the process by which 
we obtain a logical division the reverse of generalisation 
this can hardly be correct in the majority of cases for 
in that process we abstract not objects but attributes of 
objects so that the inverted operation would lie in the 
annexation of the abstracted attributes that is in the 
narrowing a term to a smaller circle of objects by in 
creasing its definitive properties we need hardly say that 
such an operation is widely distinct from enumerating the 
several kinds of objects denoted by a common term which is 
the main branch of logical division thus body may be di 
vided into stone plant brute man and other things which 
form its coordinate species in the same manner organised 
substance may be divided into plant brute and man which 
are contained under its extension as subject parts 

this mode of division is regulated by rules the first is 
that it be complete or in other words that all the parts or 
members must be exactly equal to the thing divided as even 
and odd comprehend the whole extent of the term number 
there being no number which is not included under one of 
these branches it is a common error with the schoolmen to 
assume an incomplete for a complete division and having 
limited the subject to their own category to argue as if the 
thing discussed had no existence beyond it the mistakes in 

 a conception however is capable of being divided into the quali 
ties which distinguish its coordinate species from each other as 
every animal is rational or irrational every line is straight or curved 
every substance is organised or unorganised material or immaterial

these cases appear to have arisen from taking terms in a contra 
dictory sense which were only contrary and also from dealing 
with subjects so vague and abstract as to defy human intelli 
gence to fix them by any exhaustive denotation thus if 
one divided spirit in its rational sense into human angelic 
and divine and discussed its properties as if restricted to the 
beings whom those terms denote his inferences concerning 
them would be open to grave doubt in a philosophical point 
of view since we have no scientific data to confine the exist 
ence of such a principle to such tripartite sphere again did 
a philosopher divide men into ignorant and learned or a theo 
logian into virtuous and vicious a physician into diseased 
and healthy the least discerning would immediately perceive 
that if they dealt with these branches of their subject as in 
cluding the entire of the human family a serious error would 
be committed for there is a certain medium of knowledge 
which removes a man from the rank of the ignorant though 
it does not place him among the learned between virtuous 
and vicious there is a medium state to which we may apply 
what tacitus said of gralba magis extra vitia qiiam cum vir 
tutibits for there are many who are excluded from vice 
by the same inactivity which prevents them from doing good 
between diseased and healthy there is the state of conva 
lescence and of the man ailing and so with numerous others 
ramus to ensure obedience to this rule reduced all division 
to a twofold form which should exhaust the subject at every 
stage of the process this form did not as is expressly as 
serted by reid and others originate with eamus but was 
frequently employed by aristotle and the scholastics when 
ever the subject seemed to invite its application this divi 
sion proceeds upon the principle that a term along with 
its contradictory comprehends everything thus substance 
may be divided into material and immaterial material into 
organic and inorganic organic into percipient and non 
percipient and the repetition of the process so as to carry 
on the subdivision to the required length is called by phi

losophers abscissio infiniti though this bifurcate division is 
cumbersome from the vast quantity of subdivisions to which 
it leads and also obscure since it leaves us entirely in the 
dark with regard to the properties of the most extensive 
member of division there are many cases in which it can be 
turned to account in scientific discovery 

the second rule which a logical division ought to observe 
is that the constituent members must exclude one another 
on the principle of the division which formed the logicians 
point of departure thus if a naturalist were to throw 
light on the horse tribe by dividing them into arabic 
french english horses racing horses waggon horses 
grey horses chestnut horses cab horses c no one would 
give him credit for any distinct knowledge of his sub 
ject yet ludicrous as this division may appear there 
are not wanting instances in which the greatest philosophers 
through losing sight of the mutual exclusion of the dividing 
member on the ground of one unique principle of division 
have committed follies quite as absurd in the higher walks 
of science thus bacon without any distinct point of de 
parture divides motion into every conceivable kind that can 
be presented to the eye or even entertained by the mind 
without any distinct idea of what he is aiming at save a 
loose cataloguing of every sort of motion on which a distinct 
name could be fixed in this way he enters into an elaborate 
detail of motions of pressure motions of coercion motions of 
liberty motions of art motions of union motions of strife 
and a dozen other kinds of motions equally homogeneous 
which like the above ludicrous division of the horse tribe 
present no real difference in kind and are capable of being 
affirmed of the same subject some of aristotles divisions 
are equally trifling and absurd 

as any subject may be considered in a variety of ways it is 

 as to what respect see history of logic ramus p novum 
organ book ii app his division of methods in the th book of the 
de augmentis not much better bacon was endowed with a spirit 
eminently nomenclative which led him to throw every thing he treated 
into tables but though he continually reproaches the scholastics with 
confounding the essential differences of things he never ceases to 
commit the same fault himself an instance of illogical divi

necessary to understand the object we have in view in subject 
ing it to a division and allow that to be our guide throughout 
thus horses would be divided by an agriculturist according 
to their uses by a naturalist with reference to their tribes 
but these two principles could not be introduced in the 
same division without giving rise to confusion by running 
the dividing members into one another and defeating the 
object of logical division altogether in like manner the 
division of a library could not be undertaken without some 
precise notion of the principle of the arrangement if 
books are to be divided according to their sizes we under 
stand that folios will comprise one section of the subject 
and quartos and duodecimos two others if the matter of 
which they treat is to form the basis of the arrangement all 
know that history fiction theology and the leading branches 
of science will form the prominent members of the division 
but should the language in which they are written be the 
ground of the division the dividing members are still more 
obvious 

it is not necessary that the dividing members absolutely 
exclude each other but only in the point of view upon which 
the division is framed thus writers of fiction may be divided 
into poets dramatists and novelists but the members of 
such division though mutually exclusive as far as the kinds 

sion quite as flagrant as either of those just given was furnished 
by watt in that very part of his logic written to guard his readers 
against it furnish yourself said he with a rich variety of ideas 
acquaint yourselves with things ancient and modern things natural 
civil and religious things domestic and national things of your native 
land and foreign countries things present past and future and above 
all be well acquainted with god and yourselves learn animal nature 
and the workings of your own spirits to which he adjoins the very 
sapient remark that so complete an acquaintance with things in 
general will be of very great advantage to the success of watts 
logic which is one of the most widely circulated books on the science 
in the english language may be ascribed much of the prevalent con 
fusion about logic it is a bad compound of the worst parts of locke 
with the worst parts of arnauld watt seems to have taken the chap 
ters on the human understanding and the port royal logic as they 
came to hand and stitched them together without caring how the 
apocryphal d priori principles consorted with the crude experimental 
notions so as he made a book out of them the elder degerando sets 
down this work as the textbook at oxford

of the division doea not imply that some poets may not be 
novelists or some dramatists writers of romances 

the reader will observe that division in a logical sense 
has a far different signification to the separation of the com 
ponent parts of a thing which is its natural meaning we 
divide a flower into leaves stamens and petals each of which 
is much less than the whole but in the metaphorical sense 
of the word which logic implies each member of the division 
is in reality greater than the whole for we cannot assign to 
the genus flower its constituent species rose geranium 
tulip c without expressing in addition to the general 
notion of the term the peculiar differences which separates 
one species from the other 

 examples of division the categories and predicdbles 

the most complete examples of logical division are fur 
nished by aristotle in his enumeration of everything that 
can be made the subject or the predicate of a proposition 
and of all the possible relations which the subject and pre 
dicate can have to each other the former class are de 
nominated categories or predicaments and muster every 
object of human apprehension under ten heads so that as 
every soldier belongs to some company and every company 
to some regiment in like manner all the notions that enter 
into the human mind have their place in one or other of 
these categories and by proper subdivision may be drawn up 
in rank and file and passed under review

this division commonly known by the name of the five 
predicables expresses every conceivable relation of subor 
dination or coordination to which the forms of inference 
necessarily subject these classes of predicaments so far

these notions can be compared together the categories deli

knowledge the predicables state the result of those laws of

 formation of distinct conceptions a part of logic 

thus far our design has been simply to register the dif 
ferent relations which any two terms assume when their 
agreement or disagreement is to be ascertained but for the 
comparison to terminate in a correct result it is evident that 
the terms themselves must be accurate exponents of the 
properties for which they stand and not as bacon says be 
rashly abstracted from things for instance suppose it 
required to be known if the quality spontaneous may be 
affirmed of the motion by which air rises out of water it is 
necessary that the word spontaneous should imply some 
distinct property and that the phenomenon denoted by the 
aqueous motion of air should be completely understood 
this part of the subject viz the obtaining clear concep 
tions of the terms which are brought into contrast is obvi 
ously the first step and the one most decisive in the investi 
gation of truth without it the most perfect accuracy in 
the subsequent processes will but propagate error so that 
we can only expect to be right by accident tet writers 
on the scholastic logic relegate this branch of the subject 
from the science as something extraneous to its object as if 
the operation of abstracting notions from things was not as 
necessary to the establishment of correct conclusions as a 
knowledge of the relations which such notions can bear to 
each other and the laws of inference to which they lead 
the warmth with which this view of the science has been 
maintained has driven bacon and his followers into the 
opposite error of depreciating the scholastic rules and nar 
rowing the entire scope of the science to the formation of 

 however obvious the remark may appear the neglect of it in the 
illustration alluded to led aristotle to lose sight of the fact that air 
was forced to the surface by the pressure of the water beneath and to 
assert that the motion was the effect of the air seeking to join its own 
element see bacons distribution of the great instauration and 
the preface to the novum organum with note upon the context

correct and appropriate conceptions and the inductive gene 
ralisations built upon them we however instead of per 
ceiving any antagonism between the two systems think 
that they so far coalesce as to form correlative branches of 
the same science what opposition can there be between 
the operation which abstracts notions from things and that 
which establishes the different modes in which such notions 
are contrasted together the same mental faculty is 
evidently at work in both cases and though on different 
objects with the same view viz the eliciting truth out of 
the material presented to the judgment in the first case 
the mind is employed in fitting notions to objects in the 
second in fitting notions to each other with much more 
reason might the craft of the stonemason which is the 
preparation of stones for building be viewed as something 
directly obstructive to the process of laying stones on each 
other to which it is a necessary preliminary in fact 
the very subjectmatter which each party claims as the 
peculiar province of their own view of the science show 
that the ground is common between them for what is the 
purport of a real definition in the scholastic sense but the 
adaptation of notions to convey the correct properties of 
things and what principles does the physicist put into 
requisition in seeking the same object but those involved 
in the rules of scholastic definition 

though the distinct conceptions is undoubtedly a part 
and no small part of logic it has its boundaries which it 
will be well not to go beyond in the first place it is not 
our province to treat of the mechanism of the formation viz 
whether objects are directly perceived by the mind or whe 
ther they convey impressions thereto by sensible or spiritual 
images or whether such impressions are only modifications 
of the percipient mind nor is it our business to enter into 
the origin of abstract ideas and consider how far they are 
conceptions of general properties or generalisations from 
individual groups or in what light their existence may be 
considered as restricted to the human mind or as existing 
in that of the divine artificer for all these questions involve 
metaphysical theories concerning which the greatest minds 
have differed and are quite extraneous to logic which deals 
with principles about whose cogency there cannot be the 



c iii what teems abe indistinct 

slightest doubt with that branch of the formation of con 
ceptions we have to do not which treats of the mechanism 
of our conceptions but of the principles and rules by which 
their trustworthiness may be ascertained as exponents of 
clear and definable objects but since this view is so ex 
tensive as to embrace in some measure the entire scope 
of logic it will be necessary to limit it at this stage to 
that part of the process which concerns the mere obtaining 
materials for inference we shall therefore at present con 
fine ourselves to pointing out the characteristics of distinct 
and indistinct conceptions the leading sources including 
language from which such marks arise and how far defini 
tion confirms those which are clear while it disperses un 
settled or indistinct connotation 

 what class of terms are liable to indistinctness 

and here it is necessary to refer to our distinction between 
the denotation and connotation of names as fundamental 
to the subject it is evident when we point out any special 
object as this book that table we imply i e connote 
no peculiar properties proposed by that object but merely 
point out i e denote the thing itself hence all singular 
names with few exceptions or general names used in a 
singular sense being employed not to convey information 
concerning the objects they denote but simply to point them 
out as things towards which the attention is directed never 

 genovesi correctly remarks that all reasoning is nothing else than 
the dispersion of what is confused and indistinct in a term by that 
portion of it which is defined and clear hence if some limit was not 
introduced in the exposition of terms it would absorb the entire field 
of logic the boundary drawn in the text is taken from whately 
book ii ch i note but reid see his hist arist organ p in 
the recent edition of his works by sir w hamilton is disposed to 
allow no place to terms in logic at all only with a view to and so far 
as is necessary to the explanation of propositions and these latter 
again only so far as is indispensable to the knowledge of the syllogism 
but this distinction however consonant to a system of formal logic is 
too wiredrawn for the purposes of practical utility the conno 
tative individual names alluded to are sun god or such as from the 
form of expression lead to the implication of some attribute as the 
first king of france or the present chancellor of the exchequer 
yet the latter names are used generally in a strictly denotative 
sense

fail to attain their object and can be in no instance the cause 
of confusion in our judgments they involve no abstraction 
of words from things no wrapping up of multiform pro 
perties in one expression like individual complex or concrete 
general terms and therefore do not require any elucidation 
at the hands of the logician there is another class of terms 
equally exempt from notice in this place viz those which 
are abstracted from one branch of the concrete general 
terms we have mentioned as rationality from rational 
corporeity from corporeal whiteness from white because 
they do not generally connote any attribute distinct from 
the abstract name they denote or if they do in some in 
stances it is only as names restricted to an individual sense 
simply by virtue of the process by which the general concrete 
term is formed it is therefore on individual complex and 
general concrete terms alone that the attention of the 
logician must be concentrated as the central points of con 
fusion in erroneous judgments since connoting several pro 
perties they are liable to be imperfectly known and not 
only seen in partial lights but connected with objects with 
which they can have no relation thus iron one of the 
simplest of this class conveys a widely diflerent notion of its 
properties to one who has heard of magnetism than to 
another in a contrary predicament the vulgar who regard 
this metal as incombustible and the chemist who sees it 
burn with the utmost fury and who has other reasons for 
regarding it as one of the most combustible bodies in 
nature the poet who uses it as an emblem of rigidity 
and the smith and engineer in whose hands it is plastic 
and moulded like wax into every form the jailor who 
prizes it as an obstruction and the electrician who sees 
in it only a channel of open communication by which that 
most impassable of all objects the air may be traversed by 
his imprisoned fluid have all imperfect and some conflicting 
notions of the word and so it is with other complex 
terms some are indefinite as hard or soft light or heavy 
and others so intricate as life matter instinct as to mock 
every attempt of science to unfold their entire connotation

c iii how conceptions become distinct 

 how conceptions become distinct and confused 

though this class of terms are in the generality of in 
stances formed for us and in no case do we create them 
except in discovering or combining new truths it is hardly 
possible for us to attain any clear insight into the causes of 
their distinctness or ambiguity but by analysing their com 
position and closely watching their growth in the mind to 
commence with some of the simplest examples it is evident 
that the word man implies an assemblage of properties which 
the mind through the faculty of abstraction has first de 
tached from the accidental qualities of the individual and 
then bound up into a conception which equally represents 
any member of the human family each of the properties 
which form the aggregate of the conception are known and 
possess marks which not only discriminate it from others 
but lay open its own nature and constitution the notion 
man is therefore called clear and distinct since we know all 
its properties viz rationality corporeity in a certain shape 
animal life c and can upon a minute survey adduce the 
marks by which these properties are so constituted take 
another instance that of matter this term also implies a 
congeries of properties some of which are as distinctly ascer 
tainable as those included in the last example it is evi 
dently an extended substance composed of divisible particles 
which are constantly undergoing change according to regular 
laws but we can scarcely predicate further concerning it 
with safety it has its accidental as well as its essential 
qualities and to a certain extent these can be pointed out 
for example it must be extended though this may occur in 
any diversity of form colour and shape are alike indifferent 
to it it may be animal vegetable or mineral but it would 
be hazardous to range its gravitating property in the same 
category to call it essentially inert or deny its incompetency 
to be invested with the attribute of thought hence our 
notion concerning its leading properties are incomplete and 
to predicate anything of them with dogmatic certainty would 
only expose us to error we know however sufficient of its 
properties to distinguish it generically from mind and to divide 
it into many subordinate species the notion is clear since

it communicates a distinct conception of its object but im 
perfect or inadequate to realise everything that it contains 

it is evident that such examples could be enlarged until 
they embraced the entire gradations of clearness and indis 
tinctness in ideas and though the boundaries fade by im 
perceptible degrees into each other philosophers have deter 
mined the classes which they divide with sufficient precision 
to assign to them the marks by which they may be distin 
guished on examining however any of their tables we 
find only one generating principle of the degrees of clearness 
or indistinctness they contain viz the capability of resolv 
ing any subject that may present itself into its constituent 
elements and decomposing these until the elements of their 
elements can also be resolved and we arrive at the simplest 
analysis thus the classification of leibnitz which is the 
most popular will tell us that those notions are most ob 
scure whose qualities are so impalpable that we cannot dis 
tinguish them from others that confused notions though 
they admit of such clear discrimination are perfectly inso 
luble with respect to their own nature while those ideas can 
only claim the privilege of being distinct and adequate whose 
properties can be resolved into others whose natures are 
known now this is only a more particular way of stating 
the general proposition that notions are clear and appro 
priate to the objects which they represent in proportion as 
they unfold their specific properties 

 double mode of resolving conceptions 
the general principles which preside over the process is 
ordinarily pointed out by the source from which bur con 
ceptions arise there being a wide difference between the 
determination of ideas which refer to sensible objects and 
those which represent spiritual and abstract ones it is evi 

 opera philosophica erdman p opera omnia dateus ii 
p i p first published in the acta eruditorum if 
the elements into which an idea can be resolved are unknown leibnitz 
terms it inadequate his classification will consequently stand as 
follows 

notion 



distinct adequate 

inadequate 



c hi double mode of besolying conceptions 

dent that with regard to objects of sense the accuracy of 
our notions will depend much upon the results of experience 
while the nature of those which refer to subjects purely ab 
stract and spiritual must be sought from inferences struck 
out of the primordial elements of the mind the sources of 
the first are simple facts derived from objects alien to the in 
tellect through the channel of sensation those of the second 
are pure cognitions either intuitive or obtained by formal 
inference from principles bound up with the nature of the 
mind itself and forming part of its constitution now the 
method of obtaining accurate conceptions of material phe 
nomena is either by analysing or dissecting the facts to 
which they refer and seeking to educe out of the points of 
resemblance and difference some determinate notion of their 
elementary properties or by forming such hypothesis as 
appear to suit the circumstances of the case and then test 
ing its legitimacy by using such verifications as the nature of 
the phenomena admit the mode of gaining an adequate 
knowledge of the second is by tracing their growth in the 
mind and fixing their accordance with the intuitive prin 
ciples out of which they spring 

if we confound the principles according to which each of 
these two classes of ideas are invested with distinct appro 
priate connotative powers our subsequent judgments are 
certain to be false in the precise proportion of their accu 
racy or in other words we can only expect to escape from 
the consequences of the wrong conceptions we have formed 
by a counter error in contradicting or affirming them of each 
other thus when aristotle induced by the abstract per 
fection of circular motion was led to assert that all the 
planets moved in perfect circles he falsely applied without 
looking at his facts an ideal conception to account for a cer 
tain mode of their existence and could only escape from the 
consequences of this misconception by mistakes in his subse 
quent deductions or when bacon restricted the summum 
bonum to the subjection of the individual will to that of the 
community he applied a principle founded upon experience 
to explain an idea which being purely native to the mind 
no facts can reveal to us and thus gave rise to a false sys 
tem of ethics 

 de augmentis b vii ch the utilitarian philosophy 



 teems with eegabd to things fi i 

the application of abstract principles whether real or 
supposititious which cannot be brought to the touchstone of 
facts to explain the properties of natural objects has been 
one of the great sources of all the errors which have hitherto 
obstructed the progress of physical science while the 
phlogistic doctrines of becher and stahl were assumed to 
account for all the phenomena of chemistry no attempt was 
made to bring the objects of that science to the test of ex 
perience and connect them with number weight and 
measure while the notion that nature abhors a vacuum 
was accepted as a perfect explanation of the rise of water by 
suction no essay was tried to determine the properties of the 
air and while the geometrical conceptions falsely attributed 
to the circle were deemed sufficient to determine the relation 
of forces in the lever the principles of mechanics could not 
assume a rational basis 

though the contrary error of introducing empirical prin 
ciples into moral subjects and of seeking to resolve happi 
ness integrity and similar ideas into the results of mere 
outward experience is less palpable it has been at the 
bottom of all the errors connected with false systems of 
ethics politics and theology hobbes for instance when he 
resolved the idea of natural right into brute force was neces 
sarily led to frame a system of government which if practi 
cally carried out would have transformed a subject into a 
slave and a king into a despot when hume in like manner 
traced all our notions of virtue and vice to the experience of 
the effects which society feels from their influence he founded 
a system of ethics on an empirical principle which completely 
subverted the moral nature of actions and made adultery in 
trinsically as innocent as going to church machiavelli 
could not restrict himself exclusively to the past in drawing 
out fundamental maxims of political wisdom without im 
pugning some of the plainest instincts of justice nor could 
mahomet or any of the grecian seers frame a system of 
religion to flatter the results of mans sensible experience 
without introducing depravity into olympus and making its 
denizens the mere roues of pleasure it is obvious that 

 thus platos doctrine of ideas as an oxford logician mr karslake 
correctly remarks is perfectly true on the side of moral truth but he 
unhappily extended his doctrine to truth at large and hence all the 



c hi consequence of ebbokeous methods 

the greater part of the conceptions to which these subjects 
relate being written on the heart of man cannot possibly be 
ultimately based on experience and to attempt exclusively to 
extract them from the latter source while we leave their true 
fountain unsealed tends to disenchant man of his high con 
ceptions and even when not practically carried out to lower 
art and in a proportionate degree to degrade his being 

conceptions when so applied to unfold the properties of 
objects which exist in an entirely different sphere may be 
properly denominated false but there is a class which 
though as fruitful in erroneous judgments as the ones to 
which we have adverted arises from a superficial examination 
of the properties they would connote thus aristotle when 
examining the subject of motion for once drew his attention 
from abstract principles to concentrate it on the facts he 
sought to explain and perceiving that bodies fell to the 
ground as it were spontaneously and that flame appeared to 
ascend and bubbles of air to arise in water by the same 
means he called such motions natural as they all seemed to 
arise from a spontaneous movement of each body towards its 
own place in order to mingle with their kindred element 
while other motions never occurred without the impress of 
an external force and when reluctantly set in action always 
manifested a disposition to cease on comparing these motions 
with each other he found they also agreed in one property 
quite opposite to the former viz that of motion from their 
own place and denominating the latter violent in contradis 
tinction to the former he flattered himself he had rendered 
a complete and satisfactory account of the matter now had 
aristotle only extended his list of motions apparently spon 
taneous to include that of the earth and the planets or to 
that of a fog rising from a lake when the motion takes place 

empiricists were ui arms against him while aristotles doctrine of 
the experiential origin of every idea was perfectly true of the physical 
sphere since there is no idea of man in our mind beyond what is ob 
tained by abstraction and generalisation from external nature but 
he extended his doctrine to universal truth and denied that goodness or 
virtue was an idea in any other sense than a generalisation from past 
experience and hence the outcry against him of all who were anxious

in a contrary direction to what his theory would indicate 
and had he submitted his instances of spontaneous motion to

bubbles of air for instance did not rise of their own accord 
but impelled by the force of the stronger element with which 
they were in contact he would also have discovered that his

 tests of accurate conceptions 

even in the rigid analysis of phenomena with a view to 
the formation of distinct and adequate conceptions we may 
fail to attain our object by relying too exclusively either 
upon sensation or the spontaneous processes of reason in 
the latter case we must crossexamine our consciousness 
view the objects which it presents us with in every light 
connect them in gradual sequence with higher truths test 
their accuracy by multiplied and diverging threads of argu 
ment and in all cases where such a procedure is possible 
verify them by a direct appeal to facts we must appeal 
in the former from sensation in its causes set one sense 
against the other and bring their testimony in all cases 
where it is feasible to the test of accurate measurements 
and quantitative laws if we referred like lord bacon 
only to sensation as an indication of the presence of heat 
we should be greatly deceived since many of those things 
which excite in our organs and especially of those of taste 
a sensation of heat owe this property to chemical stimu 
lants and not at all to their being hot again there are a 
number of sensations which by a wise arrangement of pro 
vidence are made to refer their seat of action from the mind 
to the parts of the body where they first occur though the 
contrary is the fact thus for instance the painful sen 
sation we experience in the hand or the foot when fire or 
steel lacerates them is nothing else than a feeling of aversion 
which the mind conceives at some movement in those parts 
contrary to the natural constitution of the body the con

ception of colour as something inherent in an object like its 
weight hardness c so that it would be impossible to see 
the object apart from its colour when nothing intervenes 
between the eyes and it seems perfectly rational and obvious 
by the evidence of vision yet we need only expose the 
object in a dark room to the different coloured prismatic 
rays to invest it with any particular colour we please and 
thus convict sight on its own evidence 

it was mainly to the want of a knowledge of experiment 
as an assistant to the analysis of natural phenomena that the 
ancients failed to obtain that command of clear and appro 
priate conceptions which have led to the formation of the 
physical sciences and marked the successive stages of their 
growth they failed to discover the laws of mechanics 
because they had no clear ideas of pressure resistance 
momentum and uniform and accelerating force but the 
absence of such conceptions must be attributed to their 
slight of experiment or their neglect to trace the principles 
of equilibrium and motion by producing those phenomena 
under circumstances of sufficient variety to reveal their laws 
in like manner the tardy development of optics electricity 
magnetism mineralogy and the higher generalisations of 
chemistry may be ascribed to the absence of any concep 
tion of polarity men contenting themselves with expressing 
wonder at what they deemed capricious freaks of natures 
workmanship instead of ransacking her laboratory with a 
view to discover kindred phenomena and to bind them up 
in one conception which should connote their peculiar pro 
perties and serve as a new kind of intellectual sense in 
leading to more wonderful discoveries 

it may however be observed that it is not essential to 
the clearness of a conception that we should know all the 
properties of the things we class together that would be 
as stuart mill correctly observes to have our conceptions of 
the class complete as well as clear it is sufficient if we 
never use a conception without having ascertained what 
attributes it is intended to connote and in virtue of what 
properties its component parts are bound together for 
the rest if we never strain a conception to mean more than 
our knowledge of the properties which it connotes implies 
op introduce it into a sphere foreign to its application if we

reject all those which are too vague and indefinite to admit 
of determinate extension and intension and endeavour by a 
strict analysis pursued in the spirit we have pointed out to 
invest those which only are distinct enough to bear a logical 
determination with a distinct connotative character our 
progress may be slow but the ends of logic will be gained 
in securing the preliminary operations of reasoning from

though our ideas are mainly acquired though the medium 
of sensation and reflection we should find ourselves at a loss 
to preserve the more general and complex ones in a perma 
nent form or to convey them to others without assigningto 
each a peculiar mark or name by which it might be distin 
guished with regard indeed to individual objects which 
have no connotative meaning or those whose properties are 
bound up with sensible objects and depend on no abstract 
ing faculty for their formation verbal signs would be hardly 
necessary to this end inasmuch as the appearance of the 
objects themselves would awaken their respective ideas in 
the mind yet even in these instances which comprise a 
very small class of the conceptions employed in ordinary 
language a sign is imperatively necessary to recal the idea 
in the absence of its object to the mind of others and to 
reason about it in conjunction with those of purely abstract 
formation in our own

c iv functions of language 

the importance of language however as an instrument 
of thought rises in proportion to the degree of abstracting 
power with which each individual is invested savage tribes 
and semicivilised people requiring it very little while nations 
of any pretension to refinement find its application on an 
extensive scale essential at every step not only as a means 
of intellectual progress but to maintain them in their actual 
position barbarous tribes and even a large mass of the un 
educated people of civilised communities seldom lift them 
selves above individual objects and in their inferences com 
monly creep along the ground of particulars hence in 
their reasoning nothing is required unless association to 
suggest ideas and sense to perceive their congruity or dis 
agreement a mode of inference of which brutes are capable 
though in a less degree but with men who deal in large 
generalisations language is peremptorily required to fix the 
complex ideas to which their minds have attained in com 
paring classes of particular truths and to enable them by 
combining a wide range of properties in one expression to 
start anew from groups of comprehensive details as if they 
were so many particular facts in order to reach still more 
extensive generalisations 

 errors to which the formation of general terms are 
liable 

but if language is thus essential to scientific reasoning 
in clenching the results of the minds abstracting power it 
must be said to accomplish this at no ordinary sacrifice since 
it introduces into the sphere of its operations all the confu 
sion to which vulgar conceptions the caprices of custom and 
the revolutions of the outer world give rise unless in 
matters of physical science where the formation of general 
terms is exclusively in the hands of professional guides such 
names generally owe their origin to the vulgar who struck 
with a confused feeling of resemblance between several 
objects combine them in one expression without exactly 
knowing the common properties which their appellation is 
designed to connote take the word civilised for instance 
having observed that men who live in cities agree in the 
possession of certain marks of refinement which the denizens 



 tebm in belation to signs fi i 

of forests do not manifest they call the former civilised 
though without knowing exactly in what the essential mean 
ing of the word consists or the number of properties which 
is required to justify its application hence no two persons 
even among the most educated would be found to agree in 
determining the limits of this word or its abstract civilisa 
tion and when it is predicated of anything no other person 
knows and even the speaker himself is ignorant of the pre 
cise objects he means to assert every person need only 
examine the vocabulary of general names he is in the habit 
of using as beauty greatness honour and gentleman to 
discover a host of others which exemplify this uncertainty in 
a still more striking manner 

even with names whose connotation is less exposed to 
cavil being determined with precision by men of accurate 
habits of thought or marked out by our common instincts 
much confusion may originate by the fluctuations of belief 
and opinion which fling the mind upon new modes of thought 
and unfix its old creations the word piety was doubtless 
applied by the ancients to denote that class of actions which 
took place in conformity with the moral law and the pre 
scribed usages of their religion with christians a stigma 
would be fixed on the majority of cases to which they applied 
the name the same term in the writings of a pagan phi 
losopher we could hardly take upon ourselves to determine 
until we knew the school to which he belonged while the 
sense which the modern divine attaches to it agrees with 
none of those schools and the meaning this word bore in the 
mouth of french society at the close of the eighteenth 
century conflicts with all 

when such names become connected with philosophical 
doctrines or habits of belief which men choose to uphold as 
the fundaments of truth or the arbiters of their destinies the 
contests to which they either give rise or serve to aggravate 
are innumerable and become too much interwoven with the 
feelings to be settled by the rules of the mere logician what 
acrimonious disputes have arisen among modern polemics 
about the respective merits of faith and works which had 
they only reflected that the scholastic theology employed the 
former term only to express a simple act of belief would 
never have taken place some controversialists seeking to 
resolve such disputes by having recourse to the derivation of 



c it teansfobmatiok of teems 

the word regard a bishop as a sort of moral inspector be 
cause the original greek word fniakoos signifies to over 
look they might as well call a policeman an apostle because 
he is sent forth atrooreaaeti or the church an assembly of 
democrats because exxijota was used by the greeks to de 
signate a popular meeting 

 confusion arising from the transitive application of 
words 

it is one great law of association of ideas that leads man 
kind to fix the same term to a congeries of objects some of 
which have nothing in common though they may be con 
nected by a confused feeling of resemblance in the interme 
diate links which led to the adoption of a common term 
thus as dugald stewart observes if we allow a b c d e 
to denote a group of objects in which a possesses some 
quality in common with b and b a quality in common with 
c and c with d c while no quality can be found in com 
mon with any three objects in the series the affinity between 
a and b may produce a transfer of the name of the first to 
the second and that in consequence of the other affinities 
which connect the remaining objects together the same name 
may pass in succession though the intermediate links from 
a to e and a common appellation be affixed to both of those 
objects though they may widely differ in their nature and 
have not one property in common when the association is 
slight and casual the several meanings will remain distinct 
from each other and assume in process of time the appear 
ance of capricious varieties in the use of the same arbitrary 
sign but where the association is so natural as to become 
virtually indissoluble these transitive meanings will coalesce 
in one complex conception and every new transition will be 
come a more comprehensive generalisation of the term in 
question 

this law in its last result has been the source of infinite 
confusion in reasoning since it generally gave rise to the be 
lief that the general name thus established connoted a com 
mon property among the objects it designated and led grave 
philosophers into the chimerical search of finding it out the 
endeavours of plato to abstract the essential properties of the 

 philosophical essays 



 teems in eelation to signs b i 

good the fit the becoming from a crowd of dissimilar objects 
though furnishing perfect examples of the preliminary pro 
cess to induction was really so much heating of the air since 
the phenomena whose common properties he attempted to 
discover had really no common properties at all and aris 
totles attempt to trace the common idea which in the case 
of any effect belongs to the efficient to the matter to the 
form and to the end with bacons inquisition into the nature 
of heat must be placed in the same category in each of 
these cases the above philosophers led astray by the confused 
generalisations of the vulgar which they unsuspectingly ac 
cepted as something real wasted an infinity of sober calcu 
lation to reach a definition which should serve for several 
distinct meanings at once and classify objects which had no 
property in common 

 twofold law of the transformation of names 

but in a greater degree than mental law custom is a great 
arbiter of language and tends to confuse the ideas they de 
note either by completely changing the signification of 
words or widening and contracting their logical or meta 
physical sphere the first case may be exemplified in the 
word pagan originally equivalent to a villager but which 
from having been used in the fourth century of the christian 
era to denote the countrypeople among whom the old my 
thology still lingered came gradually to suggest the idea of 
a worshipper of the old divinities until the additional pecu 
liarity of their residence being also wiped out the term sug 
gested nothing else in the same manner villain which in 
the middle ages signified a serf of the soil came to imply 
after serfdom had been abolished all the hateful qualities of 
crime and guilt by which many of that class had been distin 
guished 

these cases however are extreme instances of a move 
ment of generalisation continually going on in language and 
are not likely when the new meaning is completely evolved 
to generate confusion it is only in the transition state 
when two or three distinct conceptions are floating about 
a name or when words are extended to fresh classes of objects 

 from the word pagus a village 



c iv logical definition 

without sufficient discrimination between the old connota 
tion and the new cases to which they begin to apply that 
any error is to be dreaded the phrase landed proprietor 
for instance with the first english conquerors of our east 
indian settlement would have led to no error had it recast 
its connotation at the same time that it extended its sphere 
it was the application of the term in its old signification to 
fresh cases which the framers of that signification had never 
contemplated that led the conquerors of bengal by con 
founding limited with absolute rights to drive whole classes 
of men to ruin and despair to fill the country with banditti 
and to produce with the very best intentions the disorgani 
sation of the country 

a counter movement to the generalisation which custom 
produces in language may be witnessed in such terms as 
loyalty when the original meaning becomes specialised 
that word was accustomed to signify fair open dealing as it 
indeed still means in french whence it was imported 
whereas it is now restricted to the single case of fidelity to 
the throne this tendency to use general words in a re 
stricted sense is much increased as civilisation advances 
owing principally to the growing habit the refined manifest 
to keep the disagreeable aspect of things as much out of sight 
as possible and to speak of objects which give rise to any 
unseemly ideas so as to convey the faintest suggestion of 
their characteristic qualities the effect however of this 
law is not so much to unfit a language for the purposes of 
accurate discrimination as to render its general terms un 
steady exponents of their old meanings and to leave the par 
ticular ones whose places they have invaded to fall into 
desuetude and decay 

 logical definition 

to remedy the errors to which the mind is exposed from 
the fluctuations of language as also more distinctly to realise 
and determine the nature of its conceptions recourse is had 
to definition that is a mode of laying down their exact 
boundaries and marking each by so essential a feature of its 
nature as shall imply all the properties it connotes the 
logical rule for this purpose is to express the object whose 



 teems in relation to signs b i 

definition is sought in terms of its proximate genus and 
difference every conception capable of entering the mind 
aristotle as we hare seen ranged under the head of one of 
his ten categories and when he wished to hunt out as 
he called it the essential nature or according to albertus 
magnus the quiditas of a thing the enunciation of whose 
nature constituted its definition he divided the head of the 
category in which it was included into its subaltern genera 
until he reached the one under which the object before him 
was contained and this last genus along with the specific 
difference by which it was divided constituted its logical 
definition thus the definition of triangle is obtained by 
the subdivision of quality into its four kinds including 
figure and figure into its various kinds including plane recti 
lineal the last of which is the proximate genus as the 
triangle constitutes one of its species with the distin 
guishing difference of three sides we need not however 
follow so circuitous a route as a very slight knowledge of 
the subject with moderate habits of generalisation will be 
sufficient to suggest the proximate genus without the inter 
vention of a category 

it happens in the majority of cases that the distin 
guishing difference may be selected from a variety of 
properties each equally essential to a proper conception of 
the object as in the triangle the attribute of its three 
angles being equal to two right angles is of no less im 
portance than its possession of three sides yet there is one 
of these properties generally which strikes us as more pro 
minent than the rest or which is more important in re 
ference to the end we have in view and this consequently 
ought to constitute the differentia in our definition it is 
always essential however to the greater accuracy of our 
conception that we steadily keep the distinction between pro 
perty and differentia in view and do not employ an attribute 
which is virtually implied i e easily deducible from others 
of superior importance that property ought to be selected 
as the differentia out of which all the others can be the most 
easily evolved another caution to be observed is that 
the genus do not enter into i e constitute a part of the 

 anal post ch pacians division 



c iv logical definition 

difference in some cases however this blending is un 
avoidable as in the definition of curved and right lines the 
idea of rectitude and crookedness which form their specific 
difference cannot be viewed apart from length which consti 
tutes their genus 

the great end of logical definition appears to be to unfold 
the nature of a thing in as few words as possible that the 
notion may be clearly seized by the mind and no entrance 
given to words which admit of doubt or cavil if properties 
which are virtually implied in the specific difference were 
expressly associated with it in the definition it is clear this 
object would not be gained the mind being liable to view 
the two properties as separable thus to define a parallelo 
gram as a foursided figure whose opposite sides are parallel 
and equal might lead the mind to suppose that there may 
be a foursided figure whose opposite sides are parallel but 
not equal for the mention of any circumstance introduced 
into the statement of a definition or of a precept is to be 
presumed so necessary to be inserted that the definition or 
precept would not attach if this were absent if we were 
told that some celestial phenomena could not be seen by 
the naked eye it would be inferred that it might be visible 
through a telescope just as it has been concluded from 
st pauls injunction let a bishop be a man of one wife 
that the laity might have two 

the proximate genus is laid down as an essential part of 
this kind of definition since if a genu more remote was 
taken the definition would be too extensive i e include 
more than its object thus to define fish as an animal 
which lives in water would include under that name all the 
insects who live in the same element in like manner the 
definition would be inadequate if an accidental property was 
taken for the specific difference for instance if we were 
to define fish as an animal which has an airbladder the 
definition would be too narrow since there are many fish 
without any

it is clear that individual terms are not capable of strict 
logical definition though they may be distinguished with 
sufficient accuracy from others by an analogous process 
thus to describe a rosadendron we take the peculiar pro 
perties of its petals as its specific difference while we assume 
the species flower as its genus there are also a large class 
of simple terras merely used in a denotative character to 
define these in terms clearer than their own would be im 
possible and hence they are accepted by all as perfect ex 
ponents of their own meaning this is according to the 
nature of the case for if we attempted to define every 
word it is clear that in many instances the thing defined must 
enter into the definition since it would be impossible to 
commence the task without assuming some words in our 
first definitions as already sufficiently clear nor could we 
close it without defining the words so assumed in terms 
of the definitions which they had contributed to establish 
in every instance however in which this occurred our 
definition would be a nullity to say a circle is a circular 
figure is really to say nothing hence locke cautions us 
against using words in our definitions which are synonymous 
with the thing defined wolf calls this the vicious circle 
of definitions and cites as an instance of it the definition of 
a day as a part of time made up of twentyfour hours 



 definition how far real 

if we consider with locke the real essence of a thing 
that by which it is constituted what it is or that one 
quality if there be such upon which all its other qualities 
depend it is evident no definition that we can frame of any 
thing existing external to us can be accepted as unfolding 
the real essence of its subject but only what is commonlv 
termed the nominal essence viz that by which the miud 
conceives it to be what it is but as the ideal nature of 
a thing is identical with its real nature in all conceptions 

 descartes principes de philos x wolf however together with 
baumerster attempted to define existence but only succeeded in 
darkening the meaning of the word b c b 

c yet in b c v he restricts his meaning to the essence of 
simple ideas and those of substances and allowed the names of mixed 
modes and artificial things to signify the real essences of their species 



c it deal and nominal essences 

which are purely of the minds creation to define these in 
terms of their real essence we need only assign to them 
those attributes which led the mind to erect them into 
distinct conceptions in mathematics for instance every 
definition will imply all the properties that belong to the 
thing defined since they entered into the minds conception 
of it and in morals where any partial ideas are bound up 
into a complex one as in parricide incest sacrilege c the 
mind will at once recal the ideal attributes which led to its 
formation as constituting its real definition little solicitous 
whether such entities have existed or are ever destined to 
exist in nature 

it is very important however to observe that this ques 
tion cannot be so summarily disposed of as locke ima 
gined since that can hardly be called an ideal definition 
which has its roots in the nature of objective realities and 
is determined by their complexion if it does not unfold the 
entire nature of the thing or in other words leaves out even 
of its implied statement many properties which are involved 
in its existence it at all events suggests a portion of such 
nature and pro tanto is real the condition that the defini 
tion express that quality of the object on which all its other 
properties depend in order to be real is wholly hypothetical 
since no person can undertake to say whether such property 
exist and to postulate an imaginary essence as essential 
to unfolding the real nature of a thing is very much like 
proving what is by something which is not in many cases 
the absence of such allembracing quality can be fully shown 
without affecting the real nature of the definition as in those 
instances which refer to the actions of things rather than 
to their constitutive properties for example when examin 
ing the nature of motions produced by gravity it was found 
that their uniformity was the result of the ratio of the velo 
city to the time elapsed these coordinate attributes were 
allowed to constitute the real definition of uniform motion 
though they fail to express its entire nature and lead to no 
derivative properties 

 scientific definition 

clear definitions of the last kind are of immense scientific 
importance inasmuch as the quick progress of physical 
knowledge in modern times may be ascribed to the results to 



 teems in delation to signs b i 

which they have conducted and is involved in the process 
of their formation hence the establishment of scientific 
definition is the reverse of that laid down by aristotle 
beginning with the most scrupulous examination of the ele 
ments of the objects to be defined and endeavouring to 
arrive at their exact nature by subjecting it to every combi 
nation that experiment can devise the phenomena among 
which the elements of the object is to be sought will of 
course be pointed out by the nature of the question in 
volved as aristotles genus and differentia were hunted out 
from their corresponding category but these elements de 
pending on the laws of physical substances can only be 
selected through the medium of observation and comparison 
for example the inquiry concerning the law of falling bodies 
led to the question whether the proper definition of a uni 
form force is proportional to the space from rest or to the 
time taking it for granted what indeed had been fully 
proved that gravity was a uniform force the results of ob 
servation collected from a series of experiments being sub 
jected to the test of calculation showed that the ratio of the 
velocity was to the time elapsed in like manner when it 
was observed in the case of two bodies infringing upon each 
other that the momentum lost by the one is equal to that 
gained by the other the question naturally arose what is that 
of which a body when it sets another body in motion loses 
exactly as much as it communicates and when experiment 
had shown that this something was the product of the 
velocity of the body by its mass or its quantity of matter 
this became the definition of momentum 

the establishment of scientific definition therefore is part 
of the business of discovery and requires for its accomplish 
ment no small portion of that sagacity by which truth is de 
tected whereas logical definition in all cases where it is not 
hypothetical has really no other aim than to demonstrate 
truth when discovered in placing the essential nature of one 
of the terms out of which it is to be evolved clearly before the 
eye in moral speculations indeed when we arrive at 
truths unknown before by grave deduction from principles 
independent of experience it is quite possible and in most 
cases expedient to establish our definitions according to the 
aristotelian rule but where the laws of physical nature are 



c it what definitions peoyisionai 

concerned it is clearly absurd to attempt to frame our ideas 
of the objects they involve by any other method than that of 
registering their principal properties as observation and com 
parison point them out in this way many of our defi 
nitions will be necessarily progressive and provisional ex 
tending their connotation as the progress of discovery throws 
additional light upon the intrinsic nature of the object they 
design to unfold they will nevertheless be clear and explicit 
in drawing a boundary between the light and dark side of a 
subject and excite inquiry by placing the mind directly in 
front of the unknown 

 nominal definition 

up to this point all our remarks refer to those defi 
nitions which concern things there are however a dif 
ferent class which arise from giving a settled meaning 
to names otherwise vague and uncertain in their conno 
tation with a view to exclude any ambiguity from phrases 
in which they may happen to be employed such definitions 
are called nominal or definitions of names for instance 
the word spirit occurs in dispute and introduces the usual 
halfadozen meanings that commonly cluster round it we 
ought in that case with a view to avoid anything like 
equivocation to restrict the word to some one of these signi 
fications or if none of the attributes formerly assigned to 
it convey our sense to invest it with a new signification 

 aristotle being entirely unacquainted with the modern method of 
discovery had no distinct conception of the kind of definition it em 
ployed whenever he departs from his own method it is only to en 
tangle himself in vague metaphysical distinctions and imaginary 
assumptions as an instance of which we may take his definition of 
motion the act of a being in power inasmuch as it is in power and 
of light the act or energy of a transparent body inasmuch as it is 
transparent in these cases he first assumed the motion of body or 
being then that of act and potentiality and refused to consider nature 
unless under these two arbitrary assumptions archbishop 

whately seems to confound them with the etymological explana 
tion of a word which may be found in a dictionary logic b ii 
c v but there is a wide difference between nominal defini 
tions and the meaning arising from the conventionalities of a lan 
guage in the first case we define a word arbitrarily in order that 
our conceptions may be clearly communicated to others in the latter 
we adhere to that signification which is attached to it by the common 
usage of society 



 teems in belation to signs b i 

the meaning thence arising in either of these cases would 
constitute the nominal definition of spirit 

such definitions are clearly distinguishable in many re 
spects from the definitions of things though each come 
under the common classification and are subject to the same 
rules and exposition for a word being a sound to which 
we may attach any signification we please provided we ap 
prise others of our intention a nominal definition cannot be 
contested but must be taken as a principle but definitions 
of things may be contested by those who deem them false 
and cannot be assumed as principles until they are fully 
demonstrated unless indeed they are evident of themselves 
as axioms we are not however to infer anything more 
from a nominal definition than the idea which we have at 
tached to the name or believe that because we have given 
the name a definite meaning that it must signify something 
real for example if any one call heaviness the inward 
principle which makes a stone fall without being impelled by 
anything though we cannot contest the definition since it 
merely enables us to understand what he wishes to say we 
ought not to admit that to be anything real which he means 
by the word heaviness because there is no such principle in 
stones 

as a further instance of nominal definition may be ad 
duced the apparent discrepancy between the meaning of the 
term idea as taken in the peripatetic cartesian and lockian 
schools the first maintained that all ideas were false the 
second that all ideas were true and the third that ideas 
were neither true or false which opinions though their ap 
parent antagonism is apt to set precipitate people by the ears 
are really all correct since the relation of ideas to outward 
realities are assumed by each in opposite senses for aris 
totle taking the word idea as synonymous with the sensible 
image which the exterior object through the medium of the 
senses conveys to the mind maintained that such idea was 
false because it did not represent the object as it really 
existed in nature thus the visual impression we receive of 
the stars is that of small patens of bright gold and not 
suns or worlds as science demonstrates them to be but des 
cartes applied the term ideas to the reflection of the sensible 
image in the mind and consequently asserted their truth

on the ground that they correctly represented things as they 
appeared to us a doctrine of course which no peripatetic 
could dispute while locke using the term idea to denote 
the mere presence of an object in the mind asserted it could 
not be either true or false until we expressed some judgment 
concerning it and then the truth or falsity would not enter 
into the idea but into the nature of the inference of which 
we had made it the subject an opinion which we opine 
neither aristotle or descartes would be inclined to quarrel 
with 

the neglect of nominal definition when names are liable to be 
taken in a variety of senses occasions interminable disputes 
and leads men by confounding what is clear and true in con 
fused ideas with what is false and obscure into very decep 
tive errors thus philosophers formerly associating the word 
fire with heat and stone with heaviness believed that nothing 
could be clearer than that the former was hot and the latter 
heavy without in the least imagining that these two judg 
ments might be false in one sense and true in another if 
they signified by heat simply that which really produces the 
sensation of heat in us and by heavy that which falls to the 
ground when nothing upholds it the assertion evidently 
would be accurate but if they understood by heat that 
which is the cause of that sensation whatever it be within 
us and by weight that which has in itself a principle which 
makes it fall towards the centre of the earth without being 
impelled by anything it is evident that neither proposition 
would agree with facts 

it is also a very common practice and perhaps by none 
more assiduously followed than by aristotle and the scho 
lastics to confound the definition of things with the de 
finition of names and to invest the former with that un 
contested character which can only belong to the latter 
for example when the peripatetics defined that quality in a 
concave mirror which burns wood when applied to the sun 
beam to be an ustorious principle arising from its substantial 
form and insisted upon the acceptance of this definition as 
a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon in question 
or when they referred the hardness colour heat and other 
properties of bodies to certain occult qualities in virtue of 
which they are as they are and beyond which it is useless to

inquire further they palmed bad nominal definitions con 
veying no meaning of a positive character upon their age 
as correct exponents of natural facts and succeeded ridi 
culous as it may appear in passing on these deceptions 
through numerous generations by assuming the tone of 
men who had nothing to learn and pretending to treat 
those who denied such principles as men who were not 
worth disputing with

conceptions of themselves imply nothing beyond the 
fact of consciousness it is only by comparing them toge 
ther with a view to their mutual agreement or exclusion 
that we obtain knowledge and the sentence by which this 
act of the mind is enounced is called a proposition hence a 
proposition may be defined to be an indicative sentence that is 
a sentence affirming or denying the adjective being accessory 
as differentia to exclude questions and commands which are 
also sentences but unaccompanied by any act of judgment 
in whatever order the two terms which constitute the matter 
of a proposition stand that which we afiirm is called the 
attribute or predicate and that of which we affirm the sub 
ject the verb which connects them is called the copula 

it is hardly for us to inquire into the nature of the 

 definitions are commonly divided by logicians into other classes 
such as accidental which denotes one in which the differentia is an 
accident not an essential property of the subject as a man is an 
animal who sows wheat and plants vines and physical in which 
the object is simply divided into its natural parts as britons 
are those who dwell in england scotland or wales but we 
need not trouble the student with a host of distinctions which owe 
their rise to scholastic trifling if the student will remember 

that what we affirm is the attribute of every proposition and that 
of which we affirm the subject he can never be at a loss to dis 
tinguish these two terms in any proposition no matter however 
complex or in whatever order its members may be found for 
example in the proposition it is disgraceful to obey ones pas 
sions it is clear from the sense that to obey ones passions is 
the subject since we affirm of it the term disgraceful of a simi 
lar kind are such propositions it is foolish to listen to flatterers 
it is hail which falls propositions however may be blended with

mental phenomena which constitute judgment whether it 
consists as the conceptualists say in the expression of a 
relation between two ideas or according to the doctrine of 
the nominalists in the simple expression of agreement or 
disagreement between names such a discussion is rather 
of metaphysical than logical concernment though it is 
essential as the principal at stake deeply concerns the 
theory of reasoning that the logician should have made up 
his mind on the subject and shape his views of the science 
in accordance with the conclusions to which he has arrived 
that the structure may arise in harmonious consistency with 
its metaphysical foundations 

according to the opinions to which such speculations lead 
propositions are denominated real and verbal identical or 
essential and accidental as the different relations in which 
their terms stand to each other and to their subjectmatter 
determine if the predicate assign to the subject a deter 
minate attribute whose agreement has been ascertained from 
experience or withhold such attribute on the same evidence 
as man is mortal a charlatan is not worthy of esteem 
all would concur in denominating such propositions real 

matter extraneous to the mere attribution or denial of a quality with 
respect to the subject as in the instance of active verbs accompa 
nied with two or more cases thus god commands us to honour our 
parents the law bids us to respect the queen where without 
changing the active verb into its passive we may find it difficult to dis 
tinguish either subject or attribute as soon as this is done however 
the terms of both propositions by the application of the test be 
come easily apparent as our parents are to be honoured by the 
command of god the queen is to be respected according to the 
injunction of the law 

it occasionally happens that the attribute is one simple word while 
the subject is composed of many propositions as hi the stanza of 
horace 

beatus ille qui procul negotiis 
ut prisca gens mortalium 

paterna rura bobus exercet suis 

solutus omni faenore 

where beatus is the attribute and all the rest the subject we also 
sometimes meet with sentences hi which the determination of the 
predicate will depend upon the emphasis which the speaker chooses 
to lay upon a particular word thus the organon of bacon was 
not intended to supersede the organon of aristotle where at least 
six of the principal words may separately be taken as the predicate 
according as the stress is laid upon each in the enunciation of the 
proposition 



 peopositions b 

though some might deny their existence but should the 
terms simply relate to the meaning and extent of the 
words employed and not to the things signified by them 
as proper names are not connotative the resulting proposi 
tion is verbal in like manner propositions may be called 
accidental essential or identical according as the property 
represented by the attribute is merely an accessory of or 
inherent in or equivalent to the subject 

regarding the two terms of a proposition as expressive of 
its matter and the act by which they are confirmed or sepa 
rated as relating to its form all that the logician has to advance 
upon this portion of the science may be treated under these 
two heads the material aspect of propositions subdivides 
itself into simple and compound the former section branch 
ing out into complex and incomplex the latter into ex 
pressed and tacit propositions simple complex proposi 
tions may be subdivided into determinative and explicative 

 as hobbes and the extreme section of the nominalists mill 
gives a different account according to his theory of reasoning 
when we attribute to a subject any property which attaches to it as 
a class we form an identical judgment or in other words we sim 
ply affirm what is as man is an animal a tree is a substance 
since all the properties which constitute the class make up our idea of 
each individual included and to predicate the one of the other is 
simply tautological to such propositions he applies the three names 
essential identical and verbal denominating those accidental and real 
which register the results of our experience we however cannot see 
any ground for the distinction taken between the attribution of pro 
perties which constitute a class to one of the individuals included 
under it and of those derived from experience to a subject with whose 
nature they have never been associated for how are classes formed 
even according to mr mills own showing if the first category of 
properties do not grow out of the second but surely there is nothing 
beyond a distinction of time between the attribution of a property to 
an object that has been discovered by induction and that of a property 
which has already entered into our conception of it through the 
habit of association both marks may be equally essential to its 
constitution though the former may be less prominent and require 
something more than a superficial glance to distinguish it the 
name identical which mr mill gives to what he calls verbal defi 
nition appears equally unfortunate when a horse is said to be an 
organised being endued with sensation we do no infer that the predi 
cate is coextensive with the subject which however is the mark of 
identity in a proposition locke more correctly affirms that all identical 
propositions are tautologous and cites as examples those in which 
the subject and predicate are exactly equivalent to each other

 simple complex and incomplex propositions 



a proposition has only one subject and one attri 
bute it is called simple as mirandola was a platonist 
should either or both of these terms comprise more than one 
subject or predicate it is denominated compound as plato 
and pericles were cotemporaries or sir thomas more was 
both a judge and philosopher charlemagne and alcuin 
founded schools and erected churches there are however 
many propositions which embrace in reality only one subject 
and attribute but which nevertheless appear compound on 
account of certain incidental propositions being connected 
with one or both of the terms by who or which whose func 
tion is in these cases to constitute one proposition out of 
many thus alexander who was the most generous of 
kings conquered darius or expressing the incidental pro 
position as a latin substantive in apposition alexander the 
most generous of kings conquered darius or boethius the 
most learned man of his time translated aristotle such pro 
positions are termed simple complex for though the attribute 
or subject may embrace several propositions they do not on 
that account lose their unity by destroying that unity 
however they become compound propositions as alexander 
was the most generous of kings and the conqueror of darius 
boethius was the most learned man of his time and the 
translator of aristotle 

the complexity of a proposition may fall on the subject on 
the attribute or on both thus every man who fears 
nothing is a king is an example of the first piety is a 
good which renders man happy in the greatest adversity 
is a case of the second and the great who oppress the 
poor will be punished by providence who is the protector of 
the oppressed is an instance of the third as it is a pecu 
liarity of such propositions that they may be contradicted in 
two ways viz either by denying the attribute or the inci 
dental proposition of the subject it follows that all proposi 



c i simple pbopositioks 

tions compounded of active verbs and their objects must be 
reckoned complex since they admit of double contradiction 
and thus imply two propositions for example the statement 
brutus killed a tyrant may be expressed brutus killed 
one who was a tyrant and may be consequently contradicted 
either by denying that brutus killed any one or that the 
person whom he killed was a tyrant 

 simple complex propositions 

incidental propositions may be annexed to a subject either 
with a view to unfold some of its essential properties or to 
restrict its signification in the former case they are denomi 
nated explicative in the latter determinative thus men 
who are endowed with reason are responsible beings is a pro 
position in which the incidental term is explicative the feature 
of rationality being an essential part of man the attribute 
consequently may be considered apart from the incidental 
proposition as solely referable to the subject as men are 
responsible beings but when the incidental proposition 
simply restricts the meaning of the subject in annexing to it 
a property which is not coextensive with it as men who 
are pious are charitable such incidental proposition is called 
determinative and the attribute can no longer be considered 
as affirmed of the subject alone but must be applied to it as 
restricted by the incidental proposition por it would be 
evidently wrong to say men are charitable since we know 
that a great many of them are malevolent hence inci 
dental propositions which are explicative are readily dis 
tinguished from such as are denominative by omitting the 
part qualifying the subject in which case the explicative 
proposition will lose nothing of its truth while the deter 
minative will imply an absurdity 

error is only liable to steal into incidental explicative 
propositions since they alone affirm an attribute of the 
subject to which the relative pronoun appertains for ex 
ample the proposition horace walpole who was the son 
of the earl of orford affirms though incidentally that 
horace was the son of that nobleman and consequently 
if it be not so as some suspect it states a falsehood 
should error however lurk in the incidental proposition 
it cannot affect the truth of the principle thus horace 



 pbopositions with begahd to mattee u ii 

vvalpole who was the son of the earl of orford wrote the 
most delightful letters in the english language would not 
be considered the less true if horace was the son of another 
man incidental determinative propositions cannot be false 
since they are simply applied to restrict the signification of 
the object without affirming or denying anything concerning 
it beyond the mere assumption of their possibility for 
example when we say senators who never say or do any 
thing by favour or party feeling we do not say that there 
are senators who so comport themselves though we virtually 
imply the possibility of their existence and so far such 
propositions may be false 

 compound expressed propositions 

we have seen that compound propositions are distin 
guished from simple by the plurality of one or both of their 
terms now according as the composition is denoted ver 
bally or implied these may be denominated expressed or 
tacit the prior member of the division embraces copu 
lative causal disjunctive and conditional compounds of 
these copulative and causal may be united under the head of 
categorical 

as all propositions are termed categorical which affirm or 
deny anything directly of another every simple proposition 
may rank under that head but the term is taken here to 
distinguish that class of compounds connected by the copu 
lative conjunctions and and because from those which are 
hypothetical and disjunctive with a view to trace their 
peculiar laws and define the respective relations of each of 
these classes to one another 

copulative compounds may comprise a plurality of sub 

 dr whately takes categorical as opposed to compound which he 
calls identical with hypothetical syllogisms including under the latter 
term conditional and disjunctive syllogisms logic b ii c iv 
but this is surely wrong for compound propositions besides all 
simple propositions include many which are categorical while the 
term hypothetical is synonymous with conditional and to substitute 
it for compound is to confound a genus with its species boethius the 
first among the latins who elaborated this part of logic employs in 
differently the terms hypotheticus conditionalis non simplex for the 
genus as opposed to categoricus see edinburgh review april 
the division of categorical into pure and modal logic b ii c ii 
in which the archbishop as usual follows aldrich is equally unfortu 



c i compound propositions 

jects of attributes or of both and accordingly give rise to 
three corresponding kinds of propositions thus the pro 
position death and life are in the power of the tongue con 
tains a plurality of subjects while the dicta of horace that 
 a wellregulated mind hopes for prosperity in adversity and 
fears adversity in prosperity and neither houses nor 
lands nor heaps of gold and silver can chase away fevers 
from the body or cares from the minds of their possessors 
comprise a plurality of attributes and a plurality of subjects 
and attributes respectively the truth of these propositions 
depends on the truth of each of their parts the falsity of 
any one of which invalidates the whole 

copulative propositions are only considered negative when 
the negation falls on the conjunction which may however 
happen in various ways sometimes at the head of a sen 
tence as we cannot be in love and be wise occasionally 
in the centre as love and majesty do not agree together 

causal propositions are those which express the cause and 
effect of a thing together for example a stone unsus 
tained falls because it is heavy such a prince was un 
fortunate because he was born under a certain constellation 
to be true such propositions require the proof of three 
tilings viz the reality of the existence of both cause and 
effect disjointly and then the establishment of the fact that 
the effect really follows from the cause which has been 
assigned to it the neglect of the former of these con 
ditions gave rise to the absurd attempt of the royal society 
to solve the celebrated problem of charles ii why does 
a fish lose its weight by being immersed in water had 
the members set out with ascertaining the reality of the 

nate since it leads the student to infer that there are pure propositions 
which are not modal and restricts the term modality to a meaning 
which in its strict sense that word does not bear

fact which ms majesty called upon them to solve they 
might have escaped from the absurdity of applying their 
grave powers to account for a nonentity the falsity of a 
causal proposition may be shown by impugning either the 
reality of the effect or its sequence from the cause thus 
the statement that the change in the general climate of the 
globe is owing to the earth having cooled from a state of 
absolute fusion may be contradicted by proving that such 
absolute fusion could never have occurred or was insuf 
ficient to account for the phenomena in question if the 
existence of the subject only be disproved the proposition 
is simply put out of court as an assertion about nothing 

disjunctive propositions consist of two or more simple 
propositions into which the disjunctive conjunctions either 
neither and their correlatives enter and the force of which 
is to state an alternative for example a man is either a 
fool or physician at forty women either love or hate they 
are never indifferent every deliberate action is either 
good or evil the truth of these propositions depends upon 
the necessary opposition of the parts which ought to exhaust 
the subject and admit of no medium but as such absolute 
exhaustion is not attainable in all subjects those disjunctives 
may be considered morally true which approximate to it 
for instance though the proposition men act either from 
interest or fear is not absolutely true since there are some 
who act from neither of these passions but from a consider 
ation of their duty yet it may be accepted as morally cer 
tain because it embraces the two motives which influence 
the majority of mankind the proposition however that 
every man who disobeys the law is either ignorant of its 
existence or misconceives its import is neither morally nor 
absolutely true since the greater portion of defaulters in 
fringe it through defect of will though the truth of one and 
only one of the members is generally implied in these propo 
sitions and the division is consequently reckoned exclusive 
this as in the instance of the proposition just cited is by no 
means universally the case for all men are generally im 
pelled by interest fear and duty at some time or other in 
their lives and occasionally are influenced by the three 
motives conjointly so that from the affirmation of one we 

 aut amat aut odit mulier nihil est tertium p syrus sent 






c i seduction oe propositions 

are not led as in alternatives properly exclusive to reject 
the other 

conditional propositions are those which assert the neces 
sary dependence of one proposition on another for example 
if the soul is spiritual it is indivisible the clause which 
conveys the condition is called the antecedent the other the 
consequent these propositions may be true with regard to 
the necessary connexion of their parts but false with regard 
to their matter as if the will of the creature is capable 
of frustrating the absolute will of god god is not almighty 
if the earth was not made by a wise artificer it was either 
produced by a fortuitous concourse of atoms or must have 
existed from eternity hence in relation to the truth of this 
class of propositions we need only examine the connexion 
since if that be true the sentence so far as it is conditional 
holds good though in every instance where the depen 
dence is established the consequent follows from the ad 
mission of the antecedent the antecedent could not be 
inferred from the truth of the consequent thus though 
we may say if he be man he is a twofooted animal we 
cannot infer from his being a twofooted animal that he is a 
man for the same consequent may follow from other ante 
cedents 

 seduction of disjunctive and conditional propositions 
to categorical 

though the validity of these kinds of compounds can be 
sufficiently tested by the rules already given it is sometimes 
necessary to avoid all ambiguity in the higher processes of 
inference to reduce them to the simpler form of categorical 
propositions for this purpose we must consider every 
conditional proposition as a simple affirmative with the 
antecedent for its subject and the consequent for its pre 
dicate for example if its inhabitants are industrious 
a country is likely to prosper is equivalent to saying that 
the case of its inhabitants being industrious is a case of a 
country being likely to prosper no hypothetical proposi 
tion is valid which cannot be reduced to such a form 

this law of reduction springs from the identity of the 
logical function of categorical and conditional propositions 

 



 propositions with eegaed to matteb b ii 

which simply consists in affirming the invariable connexion 
between their two terms the only difference being that in 
categoricals the terms which are generally simple declare 
that a thing or class of things has some property while in 
conditionals the terms which always consist of propositions 
affirm either the causal coincidence of two facts or the de 
pendence of two truths when it is affirmed that all the 
tissues of the body continually decay and are reproduced 
it is signified that wherever one of the tissues of the human 
body exist decay and reproduction are going on and in like 
manner when we assert if the moon comes between the sun 
and the earth the sun will be eclipsed we mean that when 
the moon is found in that position a solar eclipse will accom 
pany it in both instances one thing is affirmed to be a 
concomitant of the other in the categorical a thing has 
the mark expressed by the predicate while in the conditional 
a fact has another fact for its mark the formula therefore 
represented by the case fact or notion of this existing is a 
case fact or notion of that existing is sufficient for the re 
duction of any conditional to a categorical proposition 

disjunctive propositions may be reduced to conditionals 
by assuming as an antecedent the contradictory of one or 
more of its members thus either the earth is eternal or 
the work of chance or the work of an intelligent being is 
equivalent to if the earth be not eternal it is either the 
work of chance or the work of an intelligent being the 
proposition in that case will nevertheless remain partly dis 
junctive it may however be divested of its hybrid cha 
racter and transformed into a compound categorical by 
adhering to the formula above laid down for example 
 the possible cases in this matter are that the earth is 
eternal that it is the work of chance and that it is the 
work of an intelligent being and again either horace 
walpole is right in his historic doubts or richard iii was a 
monster which proposition categorically expressed is the 
possible cases in this matter is that horace walpole is right 
in denying the existence of richard iii and that of the 
monarch being a monster

 tacit or implied compound propositions 
these may be discussed under the head of exclusives 
exceptional and comparatives those are termed exclusives 
which indicate that the attribute agrees with one subject 
and that it agrees with nothing else they consequently 
contain two judgments and are for that reason called com 
pound for example the conclusion of one of martials 
epigrams the only riches which will always remain with 
you are those which you have freely given away and the 
apothegm virtue is the only true nobility the truth of 
these propositions depends upon the agreement of the attri 
bute with the subject and with nothing else hence they 
can be contradicted in three ways viz either by denying the 
agreement of the attribute with the subject or by affirming 
that it agrees with something else or by pursuing both of 
these courses for instance against the expression of mar 
tial it may be urged that riches which we give away do not 
remain with us that the riches which we keep remain 
with us as well as those which we give away that the 
riches which we keep remain with us and not those which 
we give away in like manner the celebrated maxim of 
the academics that it is certain that there is nothing 
certain which affords another instance of an exclusive 
proposition was differently contradicted according to the 
opinions of the sects who opposed it for the dogma 
tists maintained that it was doubly false since in the first 
place if it could be affirmed that nothing was certain at 
least the act of the mind by which that judgment was pro 
nounced was certain and in the second place they main 
tained that many other things could be known with the ut 
most certainty the pyrrhonists said the proposition was 
false for a contrary reason viz that everything was so 
uncertain that it was even doubtful whether there tras 
nothing certain 

exceptives are only another kind of exclusives in which in 
stead of affirming the attribute of the subject alone we deny 

ep b v ep 



 quaa dederis solas semper habebis opes ep b v ep 
 nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus juvenal sat vii 
 or according to the inimitable author of don juan 
 who doubt that even doubt itself is doubting

it of everything else and express the subject as an excep 
tional case thus the platonists alone of the ancient 
philosophers recognised the spirituality of god becomes 
exceptive when we affirm that none of the ancient philo 
sophers except the platonists recognised the spirituality of 
god this proposition evidently involves two judgments 
first that the ancient philosophers believed god corporeal 
and the second that the platonists believed the contrary 
many of the terse sayings of p syrus and seneca are of 
this character as the miser does no good except by 
dying no one thinks himself miserable except by com 
paring himself with those who are more happy 

the truth of these propositions depends upon the truth of 
the whole and the truth of the exception and hence they may 
be contradicted in the same way as the exclusives for 
example the assertion of the stoics that except the wise 
man formed after their model of wisdom all men are fools 
may be met by maintaining st that the wise man of the 
stoics was as great a fool as other men ndly that there 
were others besides their wise man who were not fools and 
rdly that their wise man was really a fool and many 
others were not 

propositions which consist of comparisons involve two 
judgments first the existence of the thing in a peculiar 
mode and secondly the degree which it holds in that mode 
thus the sentence of syrus the greatest of all losses is 
the loss of a friend implies both that the death or estrange 
ment of a friend is a loss and the greatest of all losses also 
the remark of horace more impression even in important 
matters is produced by a little agreeable raillery than by the 
best arguments implies in addition to the degrees of the 
impression the reality of its existence 

 in like manner the exceptive proposition of terence 

 imperitus nisi quod ipse facit nihil rectum putat 
has been transformed by cornelius gallus into this exclusive 
 hoc tantum rectum quod facit ipse putat 

 avarus nisi cum moritur nihil recte facit p syrus sent

hence the truth of comparatives depends upon the truth of 
the two senses they bear and may be contradicted by denying 
either of them as the maxim of epicurus that pain is 
the greatest evil was impugned by the stoics on the ground 
that pain was not an evil at all while the peripatetics 
though allowing pain to rank in the category of evils main 
tained that vices and other irregularities of the mind were 
much greater evils

 quantity of propositions 

all propositions are divided into universal particular and 
singular according to the extent i e quantity to which the 
predicate is affirmed of the subject if the predicate is affirmed 
of the whole of the subject the proposition is universal if 
of a part of it only the proposition is particular for exam 
ple all vicious men are miserable no miser is rich 
are universal and their subject being applied to the attribute in 
its broadest sense is said to be distributed but some poor 
men are not unhappy all despots are not cruel are 
particular their subjects are consequently said to be not 
distributed being only connected with the attribute accord 
ing to a certain indeterminate part of their extension 

when the subject of a proposition is a singular term it is 
also called singular as colbert first introduced the funding 
system into france victoria is worthy of the homage of 
her subjects but as such propositions resemble the uni 
versal in having the predicate affirmed of the subject accord 
ing to the whole of its extension they are ranked under that 
head for it is only essential to the universality of a propo 
sition that its subject be taken in the whole of its sphere 
whether that sphere be great or small does not in the least 
concern it single propositions however may be fairly 
reckoned particular when accompanied with a qualifying 
word which restricts the attribute to a portion of the sub

properly considered singular the subject being not caesar but 
the parts of his character 

when the subject of the proposition is a common term 
the universal signs every all no each are used to signify 
it is distributed and the particular signs some there are 
c to indicate the contrary should the common term 
however be without any sign the quantity of the proposition 
which in that case is termed indefinite is ascertained by the 
matter of the judgment or in other words the nature of the 
connexion between the two terms where the mind conceives 
such connexion necessary either through its inability to con 
ceive the two terms apart or from its knowledge of their 
essential association the proposition which they constitute is 
deemed universal as birds are not quadrupeds circles 
have their radii equal the planets move in ellipses 
 the elementary atoms of matter combine in definite propor 
tions where the connexion is only casual or accidental 
the proposition will be particular as birds sing sena 
tors are eloquent food is necessary to life where the 
matter implies that the predicate cannot be said of the en 
tire class of objects for which the subject of the proposition 
stands should the nature of the connexion however be 

 whatelys logic b ii ch ii though the matter of 

these propositions i e the connexion between their terms is not 
equally necessary since the negation of the two first examples would 
be inconceivable while the denial of the two last would suppose no 
absurdity yet since the necessity of the connexion of the terms of the 
latter depends upon the laws of nature its competency to imply a 
universal may be presumed equal to the former archbishop 

whately after aldrich calls this kind of connexion contingent but 
that phrase is applied by the scholastics and their modern successors 
as also by kant to denote that class of facts which depend upon 
natural laws as contradistinguished from absolute truths which can 
not be conceived otherwise than they are in that sense the word 
would exclude many instances of necessary connexion and is there 
fore likely to mislead the port royal logicians cavil with 
the idea of the distinction between necessary and accidental matter 
as affording a clue to the quantity of indefinites and would sub 
stitute doctrine and circumstances of fact in their place logique

c ii quality of pbopositions 

doubtful it is evident since we can only affirm or deny tlie 
predicate of those cases in which we have tested the certainty 
of our judgment that the proposition must be particular 
hence indefinite propositions have no place in the logical 
system and are only mentioned here to put the reader on 
his guard against them 

 quality of propositions 

the division of propositions into affirmative and negative 
gives rise to their quality an affirmate proposition of course 
being that whose copula is affirmative as fish breathe and 
a negative one whose copula is negative as misers are not 
happy 

some logicians however hold that there is in reality no 
negative in thought but only in the form of expression to 
say adeline is not tall is to say that she is short this is 
correct in those cases where the negative is not referred to 
the verb but to one of the terms for then we regard the 
predicate or subject as a thing limited that is as a positive 
thing deprived of some property for example human 
knowledge is not perfect is equivalent to human knowledge 
is imperfect and some graduates are not learned is equal 
to some graduates are unlearned but when the negative 
is referred to the verb the proposition must be considered 
negative as respects the form otherwise we might argue 
that no proposition could be considered affirmative as every 
judgment is capable of assuming a negative form 

the quality or form of a proposition may be either simple 
pure or complex as well as its matter thus caesar 
loved cleopatra is an instance of the simple kind of affirma 
tion copernicus proved demonstratively that the helio 
centric theory was true is an example of the second for 

trine is universal while soldiers were engaged in review being 
one of fact is particular but this in reality is only expressing the 
same distinction in theological language logicians however 

distinguish a species of moral universality which though not without 
exception as in the case of absolute or metaphysical universality yet 
are sufficiently approximate to enable us to found an argument upon 
them as women are talkative old men are prudent professor

 propositions with eegaed to form b ii 

the terms copernicus proved demonstratively is only 
alleged in support of the affirmation that the heliocentric 
theory is true and consequently does not fall upon the 
matter but upon the form 

cases however sometimes occur where the complexity 
may be applied to both and according as it is so taken com 
pletely change the meaning of the sentence as locke 
asserts that all our ideas have their origin in sensation and 
reflection may imply a wish on the part of him who utters 
it to uphold that doctrine in which case the first part of 
the sentence locke asserts it must be regarded as an 
incidental proposition adduced in support of the affirmation 
in the latter or it may denote an intention to express this 
doctrine as the opinion of philosophers without affirming any 
thing about its truth in which case the first part viz locke 
asserts would become the principal proposition and the last 
would only form a portion of the attribute the complexity 
then would fall upon the matter but the signification would 
be entirely changed in such ambiguous phrases however 
the nature of the incidental proposition may easily be col 
lected from the intention of the speaker or writer 

many logicians in this place consider the morality of 
propositions that is the degree of certainty with which the 
mind affirms or denies the connexion between the terms of 
any proposition it may entertain of these there are many 
gradations as each person may ascertain by consulting his 
own consciousness but as their explication would involve 
the question of the foundations of evidence we join the 
modern schoolmen in relegating them from this part of 
logic 

 distribution of terms in propositions 

we have said the subject of a universal proposition is dis 
tributed since it is taken in the whole extent of its signi 
fication and the subject of a particular proposition undistri 
buted because only some of its parts are applied to or excluded 
from the predicate hence it follows that the distribution 
of the subject depends upon the quantity of a proposition 
and is distributed in universals and in universals alone 

the distribution of the predicate on the other hand de 
pends on the quality of a proposition for it is sufficient 



c ii distribution op terms 

to admit the predicate to be affirmed with truth of the 
subject that some part of it should agree with the subject 
we consequently cannot infer that it is taken in its whole 
extent from the bare act of affirmation but for a negative 
to be true it is necessary that the entire predicate should 
be excluded from the subject to fulfil this condition there 
fore in every negative proposition the predicate must be 
distributed hence the two practical rules generally given 
for distribution are that none but universals distribute the 
subject and none but negatives distribute the predicate 

but the last rule is not to be taken absolutely since 
affirmative propositions occasionally distribute the predi 
cate as in those cases where the proposition assumes the 
form of a definition as common salt is chloride of sodium 
some animals are all men and we may even conceive cases 
in whicli the rule is entirely overridden as some trees are 
not some plants no sinners are some men where the pre 
dicate is quantified in common with the subject but such 
propositions are evidently unnatural in their present form 
and if not entirely nugatory when transformed to their 
conventional shape may be brought under the two rules 
already given thus some animals are all men is equi 
valent according to the first rule to all men are ani 
mals and in ordinary parlance never appears in any 
other form again the negative proposition that no 
publicans are some men does not preclude our constructing 
an affirmative judgment out of the same terms as all pub 
licans are men not having therefore the force of a 
negative it never occurs in speech and is consequently 
useless but a negative proposition which contains two 
particular terms as some lichens are not some plants is 
still more nugatory as it might be affirmed of everything 
not only existing but even identical for if we define 
common salt to be chloride of sodium we may nevertheless 
affirm that some common salt is not some chloride of sodium 
meaning of course that the common salt in this saltcellar 
is not the chloride of sodium in that 

it is not essential to clearness of thought that the pre 
dicate be quantified i e have a determinate quantity 
either in judgment or expression in affirming the agree

ment or disagreement of two ideas the mind concentrates 
its attention upon the double sphere of the subject and 
never looks further into the nature of the predicate than is 
sufficient to enable it to affirm or deny it of the subject 
to this end it is by no means necessary that the logical 
sphere of the predicate be known at least in affirmative 
cases but only such parts of its connotation as are either 
identical with the subject or so distinct from it as to imply 
the nonagreement of the rest of its properties thus when 
we say all men are sinners we pay no attention to the 
extent to which sinners may be affirmed of other objects 
besides men it being a law of the mind never to examine 
further into the nature of the terms upon which it has to 
decide than the correctness of the judgment warrants for 
this purpose it is evidently sufficient to know that each man 
is peccable without inquiring what other things are so so 
much indeed is this the case that in affirming all men 
are sinners very few unless theologians upon whom the 
question has been forced by abstract study have ever dreamt 
of asking themselves whether all men are all sinners or 
whether all men are some sinners that is whether the 
term can be applied to angels and devils also and even if 
some brutes are not included under it again it is so 
far from being essential to the clearness of the proposition 
 some men are not rational to know whether rational is 
taken in its universal or particular sense that the very sug 
gestion of its quantification is apt to confuse the judgment 
in pronouncing it 

indeed so foreign is the effort of realising the new 
analytic to the mind that the thing would never have been 
dreamt of had not sir w hamilton been led to it by the 
development of the general idea of predicate quantification 

 we have gone into this case at some length as the contrary 
opinion has been distinctly put forth in favour of a thoroughgoing 
quantification of the predicate on the ground of its absolute necessity 
to the formation of clear judgments by spencer baynes a writer of 
some promise in his new analytic of logical forms which is 
simply intended to state the views of sir w hamilton as to the ex 
tensive and beneficial nature of the changes which such quantification 
is calculated to introduce into logic mr baynes in that work 
hazards the assertion that the quantity of the predicate is always 
contained in thought a statement which appears to us as in the ex 
ample cited in the text to be almost exactly the reverse of the truth 



modes of predication 



 



c ii 

yet no one surely would be bold enough to assert that 
every judgment formed up to this time was less clear from 
the fact that mankind had never attended to its twofold 
quantification the obliviousness in which the particular 
details of the general doctrine lay buried is the very proof 
required to show that the mind does not need them and in 
fact never adverts to them in the formation of its judgments 
since the agreement or disagreement which such acts pro 
nounce can be ascertained with certainty without further 
knowledge than the double sphere of the subject and the 
connotation metaphysical sphere of the predicate afford 

the propositions which we have examined in connexion 
with a quantified predicate if combined with those which 
arise out of a quantified subject will it is evident embrace 
every conceivable mode of affirmative predication and we 
need only negative each proposition it contains to get every 
conceivable mode of negative proposition and thus complete 
the list of simple categorical propositions real as well as 
possible annexing corresponding signs to each of these for 
the sake of brevity they stand thus

 mr baynes seems hardly to have been aware that in advancing 
his masters sir w hamilton claims to originality in the develop 
ment of the doctrine he was only proving its absolute inutility for all 
the practical purposes of logic he first writes a treatise to show that 



 peopositions with begabd to toem b n 

an examination of the above table will lead to tlie conclusion 
already pointed out that all the propositions the predicate 
of which is distributed or quantified against the rule save oc 
are unnatural and as such never used and that with regard 
to x the predicate is not strictly but merely casually de 
finitive not being implied in the form of the expression it 
will be moreover seen that the import of y u and z find 
their correct expression in a natural form only when their 
terms are arranged to bring them under a e i a we con 
sequently are led to reject the four other forms of judg 
ments as worthless so far as practical logic is concerned and 
rest satisfied with the rule already given as sufficiently in 
dicative of the logical sphere of the predicate viz that all 
universals and no particulars distribute the subject all 
negatives and no affirmatives distribute the predicate and 
thus we have a distributing its subject e both its terms 
i neither and o its predicate 

 opposition of propositions 

opposition of propositions is simply the relation of the 
agreement or disagreement of propositions which have the 
same subject and predicate matter but a different quantity 

the quantification of the predicate is essentially necessary to the forma 
tion of accurate judgments in fact invariably accompanies such 
mental acts and then proves by way of appendix that no person ever 
had such quantification in mind but sir w hamilton is not the 
effect of this procedure clearly to intimate that clear conceptions have 
been hitherto unknown or to land mr baynes in aflat contradiction 
the dilemma is inevitable and mr baynes must choose his horn 
 in rejecting the express quantification of the predicate we find 
ourselves in respectable company aristotle de enunciandi katione 
c vii and in anal prior i c also rejects it on the ground of 
its futility and is followed by nearly all his commentators including 
boethius opera omnia basil p averroes opera omnia 
venit b i fol and palius in arist de interp c vii and anat 
prior c fol ambrosius leo appears the most inclined to 
treat it with favour but this arose from his antagonism to averroes 
every one of whose opinions he made it a point to dispute castig ad 
aver in lib de interpret isenach one of luthers tutors also 
coquetted with the doctrine in his breviarum dialectica a divine 
attached to the old opinions whom luther says he killed by expressing 
before him his withering contempt for scholasticism for a develop 
ment of isenachs views on the quantification of the predicate see 
mr bayness appendix to his new analytic 



c ii opposition of peopositits 

and quality or both form as we can run any given 
subject and predicate through the four simple categorical 
propositions a e i o forming a distinct judgment in each 
any two of which may be said to be opposed it follows there 
are four different kinds of opposition viz istly the two uni 
versals a and which are called contraries to each other as 
 every man is a responsible agent no man is a responsible 
agent ndly the two particulars and which are called 
subcontraries as some man is a responsible agent some 
man is not a responsible agent these two cases differ only 
in quality but agree in quantity rdly a and i or e and o 
which differ in quantity but agree in quality as every 
angel is a rational creature some angel is a rational crea 
ture no metal is incapable of being magnetised some 
metal is not incapable of being magnetised which kind of 
propositions are called subalternans thly a and o e and i 
which differing both in quality and quantity are called con 
tradictories as all muscat is fruit some muscat is not 
fruit no forms of government are exempt from change 
 some form of governments are exempt from change 

in considering these propositions it will be observed 
that contraries can never be both true though they may 
be both false for if it be true that every man is ac 
countable for his actions it is false that some man is not 
accountable for his actions which is the contradictory and 
still more false that no man is accountable for his actions 
which is the contrary but the falsehood of the one does 
not imply the truth of the other eor example if it should 
be false that all men have a right to freedom it would not 
follow that therefore no men have 

subcontraries may be both true but cannot be both false 
as some men are rich some men are not rich may be 
both true if we do not consider the negation to regard the same 
subject as the affirmation but it is evident they cannot be 
both false unless we are prepared to assert a man can be 
rich and not rich at the same time it may however be 
observed that there is no real contrariety where the subject 
of the propositions are not identical and that consequently 
the term subcbntrary is entirely arbitrary and unmeaning 

there is also no true opposition in the case of subalternans 
since the particulars are consequences of the general so that 



 propositions with begabd to fobm b ii 

the relation between them is one of partial agreement for 
if all geraniums are flowers some geranium is a flower 
and if no man is faultless some man is not faultless 
but it will be at once seen that the truth of the particulars 
does not imply the truth of the universals though their 
falsity does and that the falsity of the universals does not 
imply that of the particulars hence it is evident that there 
are many cases in which these subalternate propositions are 
both true and others in which they are both false 

the opposition of contradictories is more perfect than any 
of the others as they are never both either true or false to 
gether and hence if any proposition is known to be true 
we infer that its contradictory is false if false that its con 
tradictory is true for example if every man is a dependent 
creature it cannot be true that some man is not a dependent 
creature and if contrariwise it be true that some man is not 
a dependent creature it is consequently untrue that every 
man is a dependent creature 

it is important to observe as the truth or falsity of any 
proposition must depend upon the nature of the connexion 
between the two terms that in necessary matter all affirma 
tives are true and negatives false thus all the radii of a 
circle are equal is an instance of the first no radii of a circle 
are equal or some radii of a circle are not equal is a case 
of the second that in accidental matter all universals are 
false and particulars true as all islands are fertile no 
islands are fertile are both false but become true by sub 
stituting some for all and no that in impossible 
matter all affirmatives are false and negatives true as is 
evident from the nature of the case by this means from the 
nature of the matter we shall at once be enabled to decide 
upon the truth or falsity of the judgments in every scale of 
opposition as e g in accidental matter contraries will be 
both false but never both true subcontraries both true 
but never both false and contradictories always one true 
and the other false 

denoting the four propositions by their symbols and the 
truth or falsity of each proposition in each matter by the 
letter v for verum true and f for falsum false the 
entire doctrine of opposition and everything which pertains 
to it may be elicited from the adjoining scheme

for practical purposes opposition is important as showing 
the force of any assertion exhibiting the power which it has 
of resisting any argument brought against it or against 
which it is brought 

 conversion of propositions 

the conversion of propositions consists in the transposition 
of their terms that is in making the subject the predicate and 
the predicate the subject without affecting the truth of the 
original proposition to ensure this it is evident that the 
quality of the judgment must be preserved and no term dis 
tributed in the converse that was not distributed in the con 
vertend for example because all salts are fusible we can 
not infer that all fusible things are salts for in that case we 
would employ the predicate universally in the converse which 
was only taken particularly in the convertend 

when the distribution of the terms however is not 
affected by the simple transformation of the subject and pre 
dicate the conversion is legitimate the truth of the converse 
being expressly implied in that of the convertend as 

no charlatan is a patriot therefore 

no patriot is a charlatan 

some boasters are cowards therefore 

some cowards are boasters 

but this species of conversion which is called simple only 
occurs with e and the first of which distributes both its 
terms and the last neither 

but in those propositions which distribute only one of 



 propositions with kegard to form fi ii 

their terms simple conversion would not be legitimate as in 
a and to render the terms in the converse equivalent to 
those in the convertend we must affix the word some to the 
predicate thus though we cannot infer from 

all birds are animals that 
all animals are birds 

we can by limiting the predicate in the converse to the 
exact extension it holds in the convertend effect a legitimate 
conversion as 

all birds are animals 

some animals are birds 

this species of conversion is consequently known by the 
name conversion by limitation e may thus be converted but 
a is generally so 

the proposition o however is inconvertible by either of 
these methods since whether the quantity be changed or 
not the predicate of the converse will remain undistributed 
which was not so in the convertend we are consequently 
obliged in order to effect its conversion to reduce the pro 
position to i by considering not as prefixed to the predi 
cate instead of to the copula it may then of course be 
converted simply that is by the mere transformation of its 
terms the subject assuming the form of an incidental propo 
sition thus some members of the university are not 
learned is equivalent to some members of the university are 
notlearned or some who are not learned are members of 
the university this may be termed conversion by negation 
or as it is commonly called by contraposition not alone o 
but every proposition may be converted in this way hence 
we may conclude that in one of these three modes every pro 
position may be legitimately converted e and i simply a e 
by limitation and o a e and i by negation 

an attempt has been made to get rid of the doctrine of 
conversion thus propounded by introducing the quantification 

 archbishop whately says only a but if the student chooses to try 
he will find the conversion applicable to each of the four categorical 
propositions it may appear that a is capable of simple con 

version as in definitions where the predicate is identical with the 
subject but as its truth does not follow from the original proposition 
there is no conversion in the case the resulting converse being a 
different judgment and not the same judgment in another form 



c ii conversion of propositions 

of the predicate which would reduce the whole affair to a 
mere transformation of terms the simplification however 
if at all practicable would be purchased at the expense of 
utility take the most complex form which the old doctrine 
assumes that of conversion by negation and transform the 
terms of a proposition in o after having quantified the pre 
dicate by this process the proposition some metals are 
not all conductors would become all conductors are not 
some metals or no conductors are some metals of 
what conceivable use can the latter judgment be which the 
first is not able more properly to effect conversion in 
such cases would frustrate every purpose it is instituted to 
effect by reducing a proposition from a form in which it is 
of some use as conveying substantial information to another 
in which it is deprived of a determinate meaning for it 
cannot concern us to know that no metals are some con 
ductors since there may be other conductors which are some 
metals yet only in the conversion of o could the quantifi 
cation of the predicate effect any direct simplification for 
the conversion of a the sole case where its application is 
admissible cannot be more simply provided for than by the 
old rule while that of e by limitation if effected in accord 
ance with the quantification of the predicate would lead to 
the inference of a particular proposition where a universal 
might be drawn and consequently be so far nugatory 

it appears to us that the advocates of a complete quantifi 
cation of the predicate are so absorbed in the means which 
logic employs as to lose sight of the ends they are intended 
to effect the object of conversion is to enable us to throw 
a proposition either into a clearer form or into one more 
fitted to sustain the argument which we may be endeavour 
ing to establish but either of these purposes must be 
defeated by crowding the brain with a series of unnatural 
propositions such as the quantification of the predicate would 
generate which are never used in ordinary discourse simply 
because the mind never considers them adequate either to 
express the clearness or the force of its conceptions even 
in the supposition of their competency they could not be 
substituted for those forms of conversion which logic already 
employs each of which has its peculiar functions to fulfil in

the hands of the dialectician to take the conversion by 
contraposition which is the one against which there is the 
most complaint its striking importance is manifest in en 
abling us to throw a proposition into the negative form 
when that form will more easily lead to the establishment of 
our position than any other as is done by paley in proving 
the main proposition of his evidences the means may be 
cumbrous but a complex arrangement is often required to 
gain the end in view where a more simple instrument would 
fail no doubt the cuirassiers at waterloo felt their armour

well or rather would they have been allowed to do their

syllogisms peoemium 

as the combination of two or more terms leads to the 
expression of a judgment concerning their agreement or 
difference so the union of two or more propositions is essen 
tial to the formation of inference or in other words we 
reason from a comparison of propositions as we may be said 
to judge from a comparison of terms but in order that 
two propositions may unite to form a distinct judgment it is 
necessary they should express something concerning the 
same object or in other words that they have one term in 
common the agreement or disagreement of the common 
term with the other terms involved will then lead to the 
enunciation of a new judgment declaratory of the relation in 
which the dissimilar terms stand to each other the evolu 
tion of such a judgment from two antecedent propositions 
asserting something concerning a common term is an in 
stance of one of the simplest forms of reasoning and the 
formal statement of the propositions concerned in their 
sequential order is called a syllogism thus 

all planets move in ellipses 

but mercury mars and venus are planets 

therefore they move in ellipses 



b iii two kinds of inference 

though every illative process implies three judgments in 
two of which one term is compared with two others in order 
that the relation between these last may be accurately deter 
mined in a conclusive proposition yet this number of judg 
ments is by no means necessary for every sort of inference as 
we have already seen in the opposition and conversion of pro 
positions we can make a series of inferences from two terms 
as from the fact of man being mortal it is competent to any 
one to infer that some mortal beings are men or that no 
man can be immortal that immortal beings are not men 
and that he who honours a man honours a mortal but such 
inferences do not embrace any illative process that is the 
evolution of any new judgment different from the one already 
expressed but only the same judgment in a different form 
and therefore are properly excluded from the domain of 
strict reasoning which is only employed in eliciting new 
truths or in presenting those already discovered in a de 
monstrative form to others each inference in the case of 
strict reasoning when completely analysed will be found to 
depend upon three or more such propositions as we have 

 the reader must have his eye on this distinction as it appears to 
us that the losing sight of it has betrayed some distinguished writers 
into an erroneous conception of the nature of reasoning thus dugald 
stewart resolves the whole process into intuition and memory and 
presents us with a case of immediate inference which the first kind is 
generally called as an instance of reasoning in which three judgments 
are irrelevant and then proceeds to reject the aristotelic theory on 
account of its nonapplicability to a case in which there is really no 
reasoning at all phil hum mind b iii c ii mr samuel 
bailey in his recent able essay on the theory of reasoning seems to 
fall into the same error in citing similar cases of reasoning as un 
recognised by and foreign to the aristotelic syllogism p as all 
men are fallible this man is fallible locke hum und b iv 
 who in this and other places seems above his disciples re 
stricts reasoning to the sense in which we have taken it and insists 
upon the distinction above laid down between the two kinds of in 
ference one of which he calls immediate the other mediate all the 
writers who adopt stewarts views confound the relation between the 
formal identity of a syllogism viz the necessity of the conclusion if 
the premises be true with its material identity viz the identical 
truth of each of the three judgments though we see the former in 
tuitively we do not see the latter a middle term is necessary to dis 
tinguish it truth like life is propagated by union two verities must

described and the properties which attach to them in their 
syllogistic union and the multiform modes in which they 
may be combined will form the subject of the present book 
under the former head we shall treat of the one great 
canon of mediate inference and the general rules which are 
to be observed in its application the moods and figures will 
follow with their special canons and rules and the number 
of valid cases of inferences to which these lead will be con 
trasted with the more enlarged series which a complete 
quantification of the predicate is said to establish the second 
portion will comprise the different kinds of syllogisms with 
the laws of the reduction of the more complex to a sim 
ple categorical form to which the syllogistic rules and 
canons are more applicable in this book therefore we 
restrict ourselves to the naked syllogism as the inferential 
link out of which the chain of proof is constructed how 
these links are bound together in the evolution of new truths 
or in conclusive lines of demonstration the inductive and 
deductive forms they usually assume with the laws of their 
combinations the grounds on which all proof rests and the 
various axioms which legitimise and discriminate its dif 
ferent degrees of certainty are evidently matters which re 
gard a higher step in the treatise than simple inference and 
may be regarded in lord bacons manner as certain pro 
dromi or anticipations which prepare the way for the con 
sideration of the consecutive forms of reasoning which 
are to engage our attention in the different sciences as 
such we shall consider them apart in the next two books

rules of the syllogism 

as all reasoning may be virtually resolved into a com 
parison of two terms with a common third term with a view 
to ascertain their respective relations to each other the 
geometrical axiom viz two things which are equal to a 



c i ttnivebsal caotf 

third thing are equal to each other which underlies all ma 
thematical inference may be said to be fundamental to every 
kind of valid inference on whatever matter employed but 
to transform this axiom into the universal canon of in 
ference in such a manner that it shall prospectively embrace 
all the general rules requires a preliminary remark respect 
ing the sense of the word relation 

two terms are said to be related when they stand to each 
other in the position of subject and attribute but this re 
lation varies in degree according to the different quantity 
and quality of the proposition in which it is expressed 
thus if a subject stand to an attribute in the relation of a 
universal to a particular the relation of the attribute to the 
subject is said to be inferior to that of the subject with the 
attribute because the latter embraces fewer objects and 
in like manner if a common term be affirmed of one object 
and denied or excluded from another the relation in which 
such term stands to the latter is called inferior to that of 
affirmation since it is much more definitive to affirm than to 
deny hence when two terms taken in the same extension 
are contrasted affirmatively with a common third term no 
difference of relation occurs between them in other words 
the relation is termed equal but when one is applied either 
particularly or negatively to a common term while the other 
is taken universally and affirmatively the relation of the 
former is said to be inferior to that of the latter with 
this proviso we may take the universal canon of reasoning 
to be what equal or inferior relation subsists between either 
of two terms and a common third term with which loth are 
related and one at least positively so that relation subsists 
between the two terms themselves observing this canon no 
syllogism can be formally invalid and we shall see the reason 
of this by tracing the manner in which it folds up within 
itself the general rules of the syllogism 

st every syllogism must contain no more than three 
terms of these the two whose relation is to be proved 

 see bacons primary philosophy de aug b iii c quce in 
eodem tertio conveniunt inter se conveniunt regula est itidem ex mathe

tum this canon with a little alteration we have taken from

are called the extremes of the conclusion or question and 
the term by which their relation is proved is called the 
middle of the extremes again the subject of the conclu 
sion is called the minor term and that which stands as 
predicate the major term 

the term major has been applied to the attribute of the 
conclusion and minor to the subject because in the most 
natural form of inference the major was by its position 
the most extensive and the minor least thus in the 
syllogism all wise men are circumspect but solon was 
a wise man therefore solon was circumspect circum 
spect the major term is more extensive than solon the 
minor for we include solon and all other wise men in 
circumspect when the conclusion however is either par 
ticular or negative it is impossible to ascertain the relative 
magnitude between the two terms there is nothing to 
prevent in such cases the socalled major term from being 
much less than the minor though there is always a pre 
sumption in favour of the contrary case arising from the 
mental habit of restricting the subject and leaving the 
predicate unquantified 

the fulfilment of this rule is secured by that part of the 
canon which enjoins the relation of two terms with a com 
mon third term by way of subject and predicate but this 
does not prevent one of the propositions from being con 
junctive that is from including several distinct terms under 
it for so long as one predicate is affirmed of them such 
plural subjects are logically considered as one term the 
rule is directly aimed against the assumption of two middle 
terms since in that case the extremes or terms of the 
conclusion not being both compared to the same term 
could not be conclusively compared to each other 

nd every syllogism can embrace only three judgments 
viz those commonly called the premises in which the 
extremes are respectively compared to the middle and the 

 in greek major to axpov 

minor to erepov 
middle to peaov 

 the first mood of the first figure see next section 



c i eules of the syllogism 

conclusion in which the relation of the two extremes is 
expressed of the premises that in which the middle term 
is compared with the major or attribute of the conclusion is 
styled the major premiss and that in which the middle is 
compared with the minor or subject of the conclusion is 
termed the minor premiss 

there may be some combinations of more than three 
propositions which seem to present simple cases of infer 
ence but if all such are carefully analysed they will be 
found to resolve themselves into plural inferences each of 
which when fully expressed expands into a distinct syllo 
gism with a triplex judgment the rule therefore strictly 
holds under every circumstance and indeed may be con 
sidered as a necessary corollary of that part of the canon 
which ensures the first rule for if there be only three 
terms each of which is to be compared once only with 
the two others it is evident there can be only three judg 
ments viz those which express the three acts of comparison 
since three terms cannot be incorporated in more than three 
propositions without repetition 

rd the middle term must be distributed once at least 
in the premises which is ensured by making it either the 
subject of a universal or the predicate of a negative for if 
it be taken particularly in both of the premises one of the 
extremes may happen to be compared with one part of its 
extension and the other with the other part as 

the wise are good 

some ignorant people are good 

therefore some ignorant people are wise 
here the term good being undistributed is applied to two 
different classes of people and in that double sense predi 
cated of ignorant and wise these extremes are conse 
quently compared with two different parts of the term 
good so that in lieu of one middle term we have two 
against the express sanction of the canon the same 
illusion equally obtains where the middle term is ambiguous 
or equivocal for in such instances two different senses may 
be struck out of the word and the same error committed as 

 thompsons laws of thought p nd ed 



 pbopebties of syllogisms b iii 

if the term had remained undistributed to cite a glaring 
instance 

light is contrary to darkness 
feathers are light 

therefore feathers are contrary to darkness 
as the purport of the rule however is to secure the 
comparison of each of the extremes with the whole or the 
same part of the middle this it has been argued may be 
obtained without an express distribution of the middle as 
when instead of introducing every part of a third term we 
specify what part of it is intended to be taken in botli 
premises but we cannot so specify the part of the middle 
without rendering it a singular term and such we have 
seen are universal and consequently distributive thus from 
the premises 

threefourths of the army were eussians 
threefourths of the army were slaughtered 
we may fairly infer that 

some who were slaughtered were eussians 
for even supposing the whole of the remaining fourth that 
were slaughtered were turks there would still remain two 
fourths in the second premiss to be put to the account of 
the eussians as the following lines will show 
eussians 

army i i i i i 

men slaughtered l 



but it is evident that in this case the middle term is of a sin 
gular character and consequently universal and as such dis 
tributed in both premises 

th no term must be distributed in the conclusion which 
was not distributed in one of the premises since that would 
be to employ the whole of a term in the conclusion when 
only a part of it had been employed in the premises which 
is in reality equivalent to the introduction of a fourth term 
thus

edward is wise 

therefore all wise men are melancholy

again 

all quadrupeds are animals 

a bird is not a quadruped 

therefore it is not an animal 

in the first example the minor term is taken more exten 
sively in the conclusion than in the premises an act which 
is called illicit process of the minor in the second example 
the major term is in the same position and is similarly 
termed an illicit process of the minor between the two in 
stances there is however this difference that the illicit pro 
cess of the major is far the worse fault as in that case we are 
not entitled to draw any conclusion at all but in the other 
we only draw a universal in place of a particular this rule 
is expressly provided for by that part of the canon which 
directs that the terms be expressed in the conclusion accord 
ing to the inferior relation which they hold in the premises 
th from negative premises we can infer nothing con 
sequently one must be affirmative for if both extremes are 
said to disagree with the middle term they cannot be com 
pared together thus from 

every wise man is not amiable 

wo miser is wise 

we can infer nothing this rule is expressed in the canon 
by the clause enjoining that one of the extremes shall be 
connected with the common third term positively 

th if one premiss be negative the conclusion must be 
negative for in that premiss the middle term is pro 
nounced to disagree with one of the extremes and in the 
other premiss which must by the preceding rule be affirma 
tive to agree with the other extreme but extremes which 
disagree with each other can only lead to a negative conclu 
sion this rule is also secured by that part of the canon 
already quoted as involving the fourth rule viz that the 
conclusion must follow the inferior relation of the extremes 
in the premises 

these rules in the common school logics are extended to 
eight and are thus expressed in hexameters 

terminus esto triplex medius majorque minorque 
latius hos quam praemissae conclusio non vult 
nequaquem medium capiat conclusio oportet 
aut semel aut iterum medium generaliter esto 



 peopeeties of syllogisms b iii 

utraque si prsemissa neget nihil inde sequitur 
ambse affirmantes nequeuut generare negentem 
nil sequitur geminis ex particularibus unquam 
pejorem sequitur semper conclusio partem 

but if these are examined the remaining two will be found 
to be included in the ones we have already particularised 
for example the third and fourth rule preclude all inference 
from two particular premises because the resulting syllo 
gism would involve either an undistributed middle or an 
illicit process as 

some minerals are crystals 

some stones are not crystals 

therefore some stones are not minerals 
the fourth rule also collaterally implies that if one of the 
premises be particular the conclusion must be particular in 
accordance with the canon that the terms in the conclusion 
must follow the inferior relation if such exist which obtained 
in the premises for the inferring a universal conclusion 
in that case would lead to the illicit process of the minor 
thus from 

all who live virtuously deserve esteem 
some pagans lived virtuously 
we can only infer that 

some pagans deserve esteem 

it may also be remarked that several of the rules assign the 
conditions for the existence of a syllogism rather than afford 
any direct test of its validity it is likewise important to 
remember that all the general rules already given are not to 
be regarded as something distinct from the canon but as a 
detailed exposition of its principles intended to secure in all 
cases every illative process from error 

 figures of the syllogism 

the figure of a syllogism is determined by the situation of 
the middle term when compared with the extremes of the 
conclusion in the premises this may obviously vary in four 
different ways for the middle term can either be the sub 
ject of the major premiss and the predicate of the minor 
which is the first figure or the predicate of the major premiss 
and the subject of the minor which is the fourth figure or the 



c i rigures or the syllogism 

predicate of both premises which forms the second figure or 
the subject of both which constitutes the third figure using 
the initial letters of the different terms in lieu of concrete 
exemplifications the scheme may be thus expressed 
st fig nd fig rd fig th fig 

m p p m m p p m 
m i m m s m s 
 s p s p s p s p 

each of these figures have their respective rules which how 
ever are involved in the universal canon and the rules already 
given and only lead to a separate statement by way of 
caution that none of the figures may violate the principles 
of the rules already given though the reader might easily 
evolve these special rules from an examination of each figure 
in connexion with the main canon we will state them at 
length together with the laws or principles which the four 
figures exemplify 

the construction of the first figure requires the major 
premiss to be universal and the minor affirmative as in the 
celebrated argument of aristotle to prove the inseparable 
union of the virtues 

he who possesses prudence possesses all virtue 

he who possesses one virtue must possess prudence 

therefore he who possesses one virtue possesses all 
por if the minor were negative the major must be affirma 
tive by the fifth general rule and the conclusion negative by 
the sixth the greater term which is taken only particularly 
in the major premiss would then be taken universally in the 
conclusion in contravention of the fourth rule now if the 
minor must be affirmative the major premiss must be uni 
versal otherwise the middle term being the subject of the 
latter and the predicate of the former would be taken twice 
particularly against the third rule 

the principle or law which the first figure exemplifies is 
the celebrated dictum de omni et nullo which aristotle sup 
posed to be inclusive of all reasoning it may be thus ex 
pressed whatever is affirmed or denied of a class may be 
affirmed or denied of any part of that class so that if 

 eth b ti passim arist cat ch v and pri an i ch v and 
vi see bohn s scientific library 



 pbopebties of syllogisms b iii 

one attributes to men free agency we may also affirm it of 
ethiopians as part of the class men or if it is denied that 
brutes are thinking beings we may also aver the same of 
apes which are included in the same category whatever be 
the subjectmatter this figure invariably illustrates the same 
principle since in it the greater term is affirmed or denied 
of the middle taken universally and this same middle is again 
affirmed of the lesser term in a particular sense which makes 
the subject of the conclusion stand in the same relation to 
the subject of the major premiss as part to a whole and con 
sequently produces a subordination of classes 

the first figure is generally deemed the most perfect be 
cause all the propositions a e i o can be proved by it 
and a universal affirmative by it alone the reason of the 
latter is that with a view to make the conclusion a universal 
affirmative the lesser term must be taken generally in the 
minor and consequently form its subject but the middle term 
being the predicate of the minor is particular whence arises 
the necessity of taking it universally in the major where it is 
the subject but this can only occur in the first figure 

since the second figure is that in which the middle term is 
taken twice as attribute it requires two cautions with a view 
to secure its adherence to the general rules of the universal 
canon the first is that one of the premises and conse 
quently the conclusion must be negative and secondly that 
the major proposition must be universal as in ciceros argu 
ment against the epicureans 

all true philosophers regard virtue as a good in itself 
but the epicureans do not reckon virtue a good in itself 
therefore the epicureans are not true philosophers 

for if both propositions in this syllogism were affirmative the 
middle which in this figure is always the attribute would 
be taken twice particularly against the third rule and since 
the greater term is universally taken in the conclusion it 
cannot be taken particularly in the major premiss where it 
is the subject without an illicit process which the fourth rule 
directly forbids 

 not as mr thompson states laws of thought p because 
it more directly exemplifies the dictum de omni et nullo de 
officiis b i and ii 



c i figfees of the syllogism ill 

the second figure illustrates the dictum de diverso being 
founded on the axiom if one term is contained in and 
another excluded from a third term they are mutually ex 
cluded and is obviously useful for showing the differences 
of things and remedying the confusion arising from indistinct 
conceptions for instance when we have to disprove some 
thing that has been maintained or is likely to be believed we 
show that the thing we are speaking of cannot belong to 
such a class either because it wants what belongs to the 
whole of that class or because it has something of which that 
class is destitute in either case the inference will fall into 
the second figure 

as the middle term in the third figure is twice taken as 
subject it follows with a view to the observance of the canon 
that the minor proposition must be affirmative and the con 
elusion particular as in adam smiths reasoning on the 
moral sentiments 

prudence has for its object the benefit of individuals 

but prudence is a virtue therefore 

some virtue has for its object the benefit of the individual 
for if the minor were negative the same consequences would 
follow which have been already pointed out in the case of 
a minor negative in the first figure while a general con 
clusion would lead to an illicit process as the subject which 
is only taken particularly in the minor premiss would then 
be universal against the fourth rule 

the principle which the third figure exemplifies may be 
called the dictum de exemplo that is two terms which con 
tain a common part partly agree or if the one contain a part 
which the other does not they partly differ and is generally 
employed to establish an objection to an opponents premiss 
where his argument is such as to require that premiss to be 
universal thus if any one contended that this or that 
doctrine ought not to be admitted because it cannot be 
explained or comprehended his suppressed major premiss 
might be refuted by the argument that gravitation as an 
occult quality cannot be explained or comprehended a great 
part of butlers analogy might be exhibited in this form 

the fourth figure is only employed by an accidental awk

rardness of expression and as the conclusion which the 
mind would naturally draw from premises in which the 
middle term appears as the predicate of the first proposition 
and the subject of the second would change it into the first 
figure this course is ordinarily taken by simple conversion 
thus in ciceros argument 
whatever is expedient is conformable to nature 
whatever is conformable to nature is not hurtful to society 
therefore what is hurtful to society is never expedient 
here the mind is naturally led to expect the converse of the 
conclusion to be drawn as the proper consequence viz 
 what is expedient is not hurtful to society which would 
transform it into a syllogism in the first figure it would 
therefore be only sanctioning a blunder to invest the fourth 
figure with axiom and rules and we mention it indeed in 
this place only to caution the reader against it 

some logicians it may be observed taking that proposi 
tion which is placed first for the major premiss and for the 
minor that which stands second apply to the fourth figure 
the reasonings of the first and condemn aristotle for not re 
cognising it if however the major and minor premises 
were to be determined by their situation in the syllogism it is 
obvious that the conclusion would be frequently confounded 
with them since in ordinary reasoning it is as customary to 
mention the fact and then proceed to the proof as it is to 
begin with the proof and then mention the fact while in that 
class of reasonings which take the shape of questions and pro 
blems it is invariably the practice to commence with a state 

 de officiis b iii it was notwithstanding done by lambert 
and the port royal logicians though arnauld treated the subject of 
his labour with some degree of contempt see art de penser part iii 
ch viii aristotle never alludes to the fourth figure and some logi 
cians on the authority of averroes in pri an ch viii vol i 
p have attributed it as an actual discovery to galen which is 
much about the same as to attribute phlogiston to beecher as a chemi 
cal discovery because no one had stumbled upon that error before 
mr thompson is of opinion that galen did not adopt the fourth figure 
from the inspection of a greek copy of galens dialectia recently 
published in paris from a ms of the eleventh century to prove 
however that nothing can be so absurd that will not admit even of 
elaborate apology zaberella has written a book in defence of the 
fourth figure gassendi institutio logica pars tertia canon i 

and zaberella 



c i abridgement of premises 

ment of the conclusion of the latter instance we of course 
find many examples in mathematics of the former any writer 
will afford us frequent examples thus horace 
qui melior servo qui liberior sit avarus 
in triviis fixum cum se demittit ob assem 
non video nam qui cupiet metuet quoque porro 
qui metuens vivit liber inihi non erit unquam 

which is reducible to 

he who is in continual fear is not free 
every miser is in continual fear 
therefore no miser is free 

the local arrangement of the propositions therefore which 
affect no change in the argument are not to be taken as 
an index of the major or minor premiss but that proposi 
tion must be considered as major one of whose terms is the 
attribute of the conclusion and that the minor in which the 
subject of the conclusion is found 

 moods of the syllogism 

the designation of the three propositions of a syllogism 
in their logical order according to their respective quantity 
and quality constitutes its mood thus the syllogism last 
given he who is in continual fear is not free is in the 
mood e a e since there are four kinds of propositions a 
e i o and three propositions in each syllogism all the pos 
sible ways in which these can be combined in a syllogism 
are sixtyfour for any one of these four may be the major 
premiss while each of these four majors may have four dif 
ferent minors and of these sixteen pair of premises each may 
have four different conclusions but by bringing each mood 
to the test of the canon twentyeight will be found excluded 
on account of negative and particular premises eighteen by 
the condition that the conclusion follow the inferior part 

 sir w hamilton asserts that the greeks pagan and christian 
peripatetic academic stoic epicurean and sceptic down to the 
taking of constantinople placed first in syllogistic order the minor 
proposition and that the latins up to the sixth century were of accord 
with the greek when the example of boethius caused succeeding 
scholars to follow the present practice which assigns the first place to 
the major premiss epist i

 peopeeties of syllogisms b iii 

six for the reason that a negative conclusion cannot follow 
from particular premises and one e o because the major 
proposition of a negative conclusion can never be a particular 
affirmative by the fourth rule when these fiftythree in 
valid moods are subtracted from the list there only remain 
eleven viz 

four affirmatives and seven negatives

each however of the valid moods are not admissible into 
every figure since some may violate the general canon in 
one figure though not in another thus i a iis a valid 
mood in the third figure but in the first it would be attended 
with a distributed middle so a e e would involve in the first 
figure an illicit process of the major but is legitimate in the 
second and a a a which is admissible in the first figure 
would in the third involve an illicit process of the minor by 
a similar application of the moods to the figures in detail it 
will be found that each will admit only six valid moods and 
of these several though valid are useless as leading to a 
particular conclusion when a universal might be drawn as 
for instance a e o in any of the four figures or a a i in 
the first figure thus 

all human creatures are entitled to liberty 

all slaves are human creatures 

therefore some slaves are entitled to liberty 
for this reason five out of the twentyfour moods arising 
out of the union of six valid moods in each figure are re 
jected so that nineteen remain as the only valid forms in 
which inference can lead to a useful result and even of these 
five may be very well neglected as belonging to the fourth 
figure as one mood may occur in two figures it is neces 
sary to distinguish both the mood itself and the figure in 
which it is to be found and to effect this purpose logicians 
have devised names with vowels corresponding to the several 



c i moods of the syllogism 

inoods and arranged them in verses each line of which 
answers to the respective figure in which the moods occur 
thus 

fig barbara celarent dam fmoque prioris 

pig cesare camestres festino baroko secundae 

fig tertia doroptt disarms datisi fielopton 

borordo feriso habet quarta insuper addit 

fig bromonttp camenes dimaris fesapo fresison 

the five moods of the fourth figure are sometimes ex 
pressed as 

boralzpton celantes dabitis fopesmo 
frzsesomorum 

which transform the minor into the major premiss for it 
was maintained as aristotle had not made a separate figure 
for these moods that they were only indirect moods of the 
first figure with the conclusion reversed and that conse 
quently the attribute of the latter was the true subject but 
as the conclusion is invariably supposed to be the thing which 
requires proof it is certainly preferable to take always as the 
major the proposition into which the attribute of the conclu 
sion enters and bring them under the first figure by simple 
conversion 

 the quantification of ike predicate new analytic 
considered with reference to mood and figure 

the list of valid moods has been enlarged by introducing 
into the combination the four additional propositions which 
emerge out of the express qxiantification of the predicate 
but as we endeavoured to show that judgments with a 
quantified predicate were never practically subject to the 
minds attention and that if it needed to express the rela 
tions about which they are employed it would fling them 

 these verses commence barbara ominously enough and hare 
been the subject of some wit and banter it must however be con 
fessed considering the age in which they were produced thirteenth 
century and the man in whose works they were first found peter 
hispanus that they display an ingenuity which might have excited 
the envy of the stagyrite himself in addition to the distinction 
of mood and figure the consonants combined with the vowels were 
intended to serve a distinct purpose in reduction which however the 
discovery of dicta quite as potent as the axiom de omni et nullo for each 
of the figures has rendered nugatory 

i 



 pitopebties of syllogisms b iii 

into one of the forms included in the four judgments a i 
e o to which we have restricted the consideration of logical 
quantity and quality we might rest the matter here since 
if that position be sound the extension of valid moods can 
only be gained by the interpolation of useless propositions 
leading to conclusions or inferences that no one ever seeks 
to establish it may however be important considering the 
high quarter from which the doctrine of the complete quan 
tification of the predicate emanates to give it an ampler con 
sideration here where it is designed to replace the old cate 
gory of syllogisms and which consequently is alleged to be 
the true sphere of its utility 

the two great ends which the new quantification is designed 
to accomplish are the amplification of the valid forms of rea 
soning and through it the abolition or simplification of all 
that is cumbrous in the old system of logic the first of 
these is certainly effected by the introduction of the four 
additional propositions v y x z already given as these 
would increase the list of judgments to eight and the dif 
ferent modes of combining eight propositions by three the 
number which constitute the syllogism would be x 
 x after the invalid syllogisms have been 
excluded from this large category there remain thirtysix 
legitimate syllogisms twelve negative and twentyfour affir 
mative for each figure so that if we even restrict ourselves 
to the three first figures we shall get forms of valid 
inference in lieu of the twentyfour obtained in the old table 
on examining the new forms of judgment however the 
majority of the inferences will be found so weak and indefi 
nite as to be of no practicable utility while there is hardly 
one of those which may be said to add something to our 
knowledge of the subject which the mind would not throw 
into one of the first four propositions as a more natural 
expression of the relation between the subject and the pre 
dicate than the constrained forms sought to be introduced 
thus to take the first case of what earthly use is it to infer 
by the mood o i z of the second figure the following 

some minerals are nonconductors 

some metals are conductors 

therefore some minerals are not some metals 
 we need hardly say the distinguished professor of logic and 
metaphysics in the university of edinburgh sir v hamilton 
 ante p 



c i the new analytic tested 

notwithstanding every mood in which x z occur that is forty 
five out of the end in some intimation of an equally 
startling character 

though the syllogisms in which y occurs alone or in com 
bination vith any of the four propositions o e i o are com 
petent to communicate information which might fairly form 
the subject of inference yet this is done in so unnatural a 
manner that the mind even in its most confused state never 
stumbles upon them by the remotest accident thus who 
could ever be led to infer y y y in the first figure 
some beasts are all clovenfooted 
but some animals are all beasts 
therefore some animals are all clovenfooted 

yet this is an average specimen of the class of syllogisms 
the reader would get from introducing y into the series of 
propositions it is obvious as we have before remarked 
that if the mind had to express such a relation it would 
transfer the terms thus 

all clovenfooted creatures are beasts 

but all beasts are animals 

therefore all clovenfooted creatures are animals 
which would bring the syllogism into the mood a a a on 
account therefore of that mental law which leads us in 
variably to affirm the particular of the universal and con 
sequently to assign to the latter the first place or in other 
words to make it the subject of the judgment the propo 
sition y may be regarded as deformed and useless in logic 
its place is always naturally supplied by a 

the moods in which u occurs though not so faulty in ex 
pression may be put out of court for the same reasons as 
y its functions being so completely discharged by a that no 
instance can be adduced of a practicable nature which would 
call for its interposition thus to take a casual instance in 
v a a of the second figure 

all responsible agents are all men 

but all ethiopians are men 

therefore all ethiopians are responsible agents 

we do not require the attribute of the major to be taken 
universally to get the conclusion which would be equally 
evident were the more natural judgment a viz ail 



 peoperties of syllogisms b iii 

responsible agents are men substituted in its place the 
mind indeed never adverts to the extension of the predicate 
further than is required to ascertain whether it can be 
affirmed or denied of the subject the consideration how far 
it may overlap it or to what other things it may be applied 
would be quite extraneous to the judgment before it and is 
therefore never dwelt upon admitting therefore the ex 
tension of the valid forms of reasoning at which the doctrine 
of quantification aims a close inspection of the new judg 
ments which arise from its application compels us to reject 
it as useless for where the inference to which they lead is 
not equivocal or ambiguous it is too awkward to be ever 
used and in the latter case the relations of the judgment 
and the subsequent inference find their natural expression 
in the nineteen moods already given 

nor is the plea of utility unadmitted by the advocates of 
the new system who advocate many changes on that ground 
although they involve themselves in not a little inconsistency 
by challenging at the same time for logic the evolution of all 
the conceivable modes of thought that the two principles 
are often in antagonism no one can deny since many modes 
of inference are conceivable which have no practicable utility 
and least of all the proposers of the new quantification who 
reject the fourth figure on the very ground that we extrude 
the new analytic from a practical system of logic viz that 
of its utility but as they have admitted the competency of 
that test to sweep away a figure along with its five moods 
they cannot shield themselves from its application to the new 
table of judgments which it will be found to explode quite as 
effectually as the fourth figure but we are disposed to carry 
the test of utility to higher ground and apply it to the very 
extension of reasoning forms which it is the professed mis 
sion of the new analytic to establish is it really conducive 
to those functions which logic was created to discharge that 
the forms of valid reasonings should be multiplied we 
think otherwise the aim of logical science is simply to 
teach men to reason legitimately and to place in their hands 
a body of rules by which sophisms may be detected and the 
fewer the forms to which all correct and habitual inference 
may be reduced the more compact the moods in which all 
legitimate reasoning can be represented the better and sooner 
 see mr baynessnew analytic 



c i the new analytic tested 

will this object be effected to scatter the nineteen legiti 
mate forms of inference over distinct moods comprising 
the conceivable as well as the actual forms of reasoning is 
only breaking down the fence which enables us to hunt a 
sophism into a corner and by multiplying the valid tests to 
which any argument can be brought to multiply besides 
the additional labour our chance of error in the application 
of them the aim of the new analytic therefore in enlarging 
the field of inference is hardly fortunate in a practical sense 
it does not succeed and even if it accomplished its object 
success would be worse than defeat for it would be accom 
panied by the destruction of the very simplification which 
render the doctrine of the syllogism really serviceable to the 
reasoner 

it is notwithstanding one of the professed aims of the new 
analytic to simplify logic and that through the very means by 
which its lists of valid judgments would be rendered more com 
plex and it is supposed to effect this object in three ways 
viz by reducing the general rules to one complete canon 
by the abolition of the special rules of the figures and by 
the removal of the erroneous doctrine of conversion of pro 
positions and reduction of syllogisms the first and second 
notion we need hardly say are simply absurd inasmuch as 
the general rules and even the special rules of the figures 
are in nowise distinct from the canon but only act as so 
many cautions which it is advisable for the reasoner to have 
before him in order that he may not violate any of its prin 
ciples they might therefore be omitted from the old logic 
with as much propriety as from the system sought to be 
established and with more security against error since its 
code of valid syllogisms are much fewer than those arising 
out of the quantification of the predicate and consequently 
afford less ground for the violation of the canon but in 
reality they can be spared in neither system as it is obvi 
ously necessary to secure the understanding from error that 
every mode by which a deviation can occur from the princi 
ples of right reason should be drawn out distinctly before it 
the ten commandments are reduced by theologians to two 
but it would hardly conduce to the fulfilment of the natural 
law to insist on that account upon their abolition 

with regard to the cranky doctrine of reduction it does 
 mr bayness new analytic 



 notation op the syllogism is hi 

not require the introduction of the new analytic to escape 
from its intricacies as the legitimation of each figure by its 
own axiom renders that doctrine not only nugatory but 
absurd it has been consequently avoided by many logi 
cians from the days of wolf downwards who never dreamt 
of quantification and we have omitted it in this logic on 
similar grounds as respects conversion we in the last 
book have shown the object which it is intended to effect is 
indispensable to many forms of solid argument and pre 
sents a lever of proof which could not be supplied by the 
quantification of the predicate its abrogation therefore 
would only weaken the science by depriving it of one of 
the means of producing conviction 

the introduction of the new analytic therefore can 
serve no purpose of simplification beyond that already 
attained while it would materially enhance the danger of 
error by enlarging the list of valid moods in each figure to 
which the rules would have to be applied and in some mea 
sure introduce the complexity into logic it was designed to 
abolish we consequently reject it on three distinct counts 
because a part of the object at which it aims is chimerical 
because it fails to accomplish the remaining part and 
thirdly because that portion of the object even if achieved 
would be destructive of the very simplification it is instituted 
to realise

notation of the syllogism 

 eulers method 

the relations which mentally subsist between conceptions 
have been attempted to be represented to the eye by dia 
grams and though some mathematical logicians have carried 

 it would exceed our limits to answer the particular charges which 
sir w hamilton through the medium of his pupils essay brings 
against the old doctrine of mood and figure such as that of inconsis 
tency in the discrimination of mood where there is no difference of 
quantity and quality but a mere transposition of terms and that of 
mere accidents of expression prevailing over essential forms of thought 
in rendering moods valid in one figure invalid in another every one 
of these allegations admit of a satisfactory reply which we reserve 
however for another place 



c ii ettlers method 

this species of notation too far it must be allowed if kept 
within moderate bounds to facilitate logical analysis 

the most celebrated scheme and at the same time the 
simplest is that of euler which represents the sphere of a 
conception by a circle an affirmative judgment by one 
circle wholly or partly contained in another and a negative 
by two separate circles thus since the proposition all 
plants are organised beings includes under organised beings 
many species of plant the former term is represented by a 
large circle and the latter by a small one enclosed within it 
if we consequently include avaleas in the class plant 
this term will fall into a smaller circle than plant and be 
enclosed by it in return we shall thus get the diagram 




as illustrative of the mood a a a of course in the first 
figure in which it can only occur 

again were we to infer that some stones have deter 
mined figures from the fact that all crystals have deter 
minate figures and some stones are crystals the scheme 
may obviously be represented by making the circle which 
denotes crystals cut the circles denoting stones and deter 
minate figures thus 




this constitutes a i i of the first figure the mood e t o 
of the same figure is represented in a simpler form thus 
supposing it required to prove some men are not respon 
sible agents our argument would naturally be 

 ploucquet one of the first to introduce it appears to labour under 
this error with condillac prof de morgan in his excellent trea 
tise on formal logic may be said to use a phrase of bacons to 
corrupt logic by mathematics what end can it serve to invest logical 
relations with the forms of the calculus and to be constantly carrying 
analogies below zero and considering them under some relation of in 
finitude lettres a une princesse dallemagne vol ii p 
and continuation 



 notation of the syllogism b iii 

none who have lost their reason are responsible 
but some men lunatics have lost their reason 
therefore some men are not responsible 

assuming a for the middle term b for the attribute of the 
conclusion and c for the subject we get either of the two 
figures 




for it is not necessary to know how far c may be included 
in b to infer the conclusion it may in fact either be iden 
tical with it or wholly included in it or only in part 

in addition to the transparent clearness with which 
this notation serves to bring out the relative extension of 
the terms of a syllogism it occasionally is useful in show 
ing the falsity of an argument hardly perceptible when 
conveyed in ordinary language as 

some learned men are misers 

no miser is virtuous 

therefore some virtuous men are not learned 

eepresenting the major minor and middle by the letters a 
j it is evident that no part of b virtuous men is in 
cluded in c misers their spheres consequently are quite 



separate j but because some of the class a 

s v v 

is included in jb that is q b we are not on that ac 



 

count entitled to say that part of c is not a as for anything 
we know it may be included in the whole of it the only 
legitimate inference it is competent to us to draw in this case 
is that part of a which is included in b is not c 
again suppose it required to notify 

some a is b some a is b 

all bis c or alibis c 

therefore some c is a therefore some c is b 






c ii geeman methods 

or its negative 

some a is not

therefore some c is not s 
the figures would evidently be

 ploucquet and lamberts method 

the method which ploucquet introduced and lambert 
perfected is more definite than eulers and consequently 
of much easier application it serves also to bring out 
many inferences which eulers notation hardly suggests 
from substituting for the sphere of a term the more logical 
idea of its distribution thus a distributed term is de 
noted by an horizontal line with the letter 

s p or m attached according as it is the subject predicate 
or middle term of the syllogism while an undistributed 

term is marked by a row of dots in a 

line with its significant letter 

now premising that every affirmative judgment is repre 
sented by drawing one line under the other the predicate 
being always uppermost and every negative by drawing the 
two lines apart we may represent the argument adduced 
by dryden in defence of christianity

 sir w hamiltons method 

the notation of sir w hamilton surpasses all its prede 
cessors in its completeness and simplicity and were it 
not exclusively framed to meet the extensive changes which 
the introduction of the new analytic would introduce into 
logic its practical value would be inappreciable the former 
systems of notation only embrace the extension of a syllo 
gism this includes its intension besides denoting the pre 
mises which may be converted without changing the mood 
of the figure to give the entire method would be useless 
as we have not adopted the system to which it corresponds 
its outlines however are well worthy of inspection as a spe 
cimen of learned ingenuity 

the middle term is invariably represented by its initial 
letter m while c and f stand for the two terms of the con 
clusion a colon denotes the distribution of the term to 
which it is annexed a comma signifies it is not distri 
buted when the middle term consequently has on one 
side and on the other its extension is determined by 
the term with which either of those marks is associated in 
judgment the agreement of two terms is signified by 
and disagreement by the thick end of the bar denoting 
the subject the thin end the predicate when we regard the 
extension of the terms but contrariwise when the syllogism 



c ii hamiltons method 

is interpreted according to its intension thus in the one 
case c m would denote all g is some m in the 
other all m is some 

the terms are generally stated in the same line with a bar 
drawn beneath them to indicate the conclusion but as in 
the second and third figures there may be two conclusions 
indifferently a second bar is drawn above the terms to ex 
press the second of them thus oersteds argument 
all cases of magnetic polarity are cases of opposite pro 
perties in opposite directions 

but some electric phenomena viz the voltaic pile and 
electrified minerals develope opposite properties in 
opposite directions 
therefore some electric phenomena are all cases of 

magnetic polarity 
would figure thus 




for according to this system it is of little moment whether 
we infer from the premises 

some electrical phenomena are all cases of magnetic 

polarity 
or 

all cases of magnetic polarity are some electrical phe 
nomena 

as its author will allow no distinction between major and 
minor premiss 

we may add the mark placed under a mood de 
notes that the premises may be converted without affecting 
either the quantity or quality but the sign between 

two moods signifies that this transposition of the premises 
cannot occur without the two corresponding syllogisms 
changing places with each other this may be easily per 
ceived without further explanation from the adjoining dia 
gram of syllogisms in the first figure 




 notation of the syllogism b iii 

 use of notation equivalent syllogisms 

the chief end of any adequate system of notation is to 
present to the eye by a species of symbolical language all 
the intricate relations which subsist between terms in a syl 
logism so that no point may be overlooked which has any 
bearing on the conclusion and the inference be viewed in all 
the various shapes which the premises allow it to assume 
it is not only serviceable in simply illustrating the rules of 
syllogisms though that utility is sufficiently great to chal 
lenge its admission into every logical system but it can 
moreover be employed by way of a glaring instance to 
test the validity of an argument when the application of the 
canon to its syllogistic form has been attended with a doubt 
ful result 

another great advantage attending notation is that if 
properly developed it must not only represent the mutual 
relations of terms but to some extent of propositions and 
syllogisms it is in many cases very desirable to know what 
premises can be converted without changing the mood of the 
syllogism i e without interfering with the quantity and 
quality of each proposition in it what syllogisms in eacli 
figure will pass into one anothers place on the transposition 
of the premises and also in how many figures the same ar 
gument may be stated so that if its cogency be denied 
in one it may be presented in another 

it is obvious though neither judgment or inference may 
derive more intrinsic light or force from one mode of state 
ment more than another that there are certain forms in 
which an argument will strike conviction to some minds 
which if presented in another though equally conclusive 
shape it would have failed to effect and it becomes there 
fore of moment to the logician to be familiar with all the 
modes in which a valid syllogism can be urged in order 
that when conviction does not attend his reasonings in one 
form he may produce them in another all the artifices 
indeed of mood conversion and figure comprise only a 
species of symbolical representation witli a view to show 
the various ways in which the relation between the terms of 
an argument can be expressed while that relation remains 
fixed and immutable 

with a view to exhibit the utility of this species of cipher 



o in equivalent syllogisms 

as far as equivalent syllogisms are concerned let it be re 
quired to be shown in bow many ways tbe following argu 
ment may be proved 

electricity will travel along a tied nerve 

the nervous fluid will not travel along a tied nerve 

therefore the nervous fluid is not electricity 

this is a syllogism in camestres and the permanent relation 
of the terms would be represented in lamberts method by 

m 

p 

but by a glance at the lines it is obvious we can express the 
same argument quite as conclusively in cesare thus 
the nervous fluid will not travel along a tied nerve 
electricity will travel along a tied nerve 
therefore electricity is not the electric fluid 
or instead of asserting that no part of s agrees with m we 
may express the converse which will lead to a syllogism in 
celarent of the first figure 

nothing that travels along a tied nerve can be the elec 
tric fluid 

electricity travels along a tied nerve 
therefore electricity cannot be the nervous fluid 
in this manner notation is preeminently useful in suggest 
ing all the inferences which may be drawn from the syllo 
gistic relation of terms thus leaving the logician at liberty 
to choose that which best suits his purpose either in the 
establishment or demonstration of fact or in producing con 
viction in the mind of others 



chaptee iii 

kinds of syllogisms 

 complex syllogisms 

every form of argument yet considered has been of a 
simple incomplex character with a view to place the nature 
of the syllogism in as clear a light as possible that there 
might be no difficulty in comprehending the full import of 
its various properties and the bearings of the rules which 



 ktnds of syllogisms b iii 

legitimise its forms but a large class of reasonings are 
composed of syllogisms some complex and others compound 
in their characters which it is obviously necessary to deal 
with either by resolving them into simple incomplex syllo 
gisms and thus bringing them under the rules already given 
or by creating new rules by which their validity may be 
tested on their own grounds 

of these perhaps embracing the largest class of reason 
ings and certainly the most difficult to bring under distinct 
rules are complex syllogisms they generally present a 
simple incomplex minor premiss combined with a major pre 
miss and conclusion in which incidental propositions are 
introduced and occasionally the complexity of the syllogism 
is enhanced from the conclusion not being taken entire in 
each of the premises and consequently being only in part 
compared with the middle term thus 

the sun is a thing insensible 

the persians worship the sun 

therefore the persians worship a thing insensible 

in which worship though excluded from the major is intro 
duced in the minor and conclusion 

to reduce this class of syllogisms to a simple incomplex 
form we need only follow the rules already given for the 
simplification of the propositions of which they are com 
posed eliminating every part of the terms which have no 
relation to the inference and limiting the major to the exact 
sense in which it is taken in the proposition thus in this 
syllogism 

the virtuous only are happy 

some rich men are not virtuous 

therefore there are rich men who are not happy 

the major being an exclusive proposition is in reality com 
posed of two propositions viz all the virtuous are happy 
and all who are not virtuous are not happy but since the 
force of the inference depends entirely upon the last proposi 
tion we adopt it exclusively and thus make the subject of the 
major all who are not virtuous the predicate in the minor 
premiss which changes its quality as 



c iii complex syllogisms 

all who are not virtuous are not happy 

some rich men are among the number of those who are 

not virtuous 
therefore some rich men are not happy 

to denude the syllogism of all words which are irrelevant 
to the inference and set the terms in a clear light it is fre 
quently necessary to transfer the active verb which generally 
enters into complex propositions to its passive tense as 

the divine law commands us to honour our rulers 
victoria is our ruler 

therefore the divine law commands us to honour vic 
toria 

although the term rulers in the major of this syllogism 
appears to be the attribute it is in reality the subject since 
we affirm of it that they are to be honoured on the authority 
of the divine law the syllogism should therefore stand 

rulers are to be honoured by the command of the 

divine law 

but victoria is our ruler 
therefore victoria is to be honoured by the command 

of the divine law 

where the clauses in brackets being obviously incidental 
only to the inference may be omitted without affecting its 
validity 

it often happens that a part of the premiss may be inci 
dental in one sense and an essential constituent of the judg 
ment in another as 

 many have cited such syllogisms to prove that the rule which 
asserts that no inference can be drawn from two negative propositions 
is false without observing that the negation in the minor falls on the 
term which is privative and not on the verb and that as in the above 
proposition if the attribute of the minor was not taken in a privative 
sense the term would not have the same import in both propositions 
of this kind of syllogism the following is taken from art de pensor 
part iii ch ix 

that which has no parts cannot perish by the dissolution of its 
parts 

the soul is a substance which has no parts 

therefore the soul cannot perish by the dissolution of its parts

 kinds of syllogisms b iii 

all philosophers maintain that heavy things fall to the 

ground without being impelled by anything 
but this is an error 

therefore all philosophers may teach error 
here the first part of the minor is the subject for we affirm 
of philosophers that they k teach a certain doctrine but 
should we argue 

all philosophers maintain that heavy things fall to the 

ground without being impelled by anything 
but stones are heavy 

therefore stones fall to the ground without being im 
pelled by anything 

the minor or complex proposition would become the major 
and that part of it which was the subject before would be 
come an incidental proposition merely qualifying the attri 
bute and having no bearing on the inference thus 
heavy things fall to the ground without being impelled 
by anything according to the teaching of philoso 
phers 

but stones are heavy 

therefore stones fall to the ground without being im 
pelled by anything according to the teaching of 
philosophers 

it is therefore necessary before eliminating from the terms 
of the syllogism such words as are only incidental to know 
distinctly what is aimed at by the proof as part of a propo 
sition may be a term in one sense and only an incidental 
expression qualifying a term in another 

some logicians desirous to find a shorter process to the 
validity of such syllogisms than their reduction to incomplex 
forms and the application of the general rules afford have 
placed the entire artifice of reasoning in showing that the 
conclusion is contained in one of the first propositions by 
the interpolation of another which establishes the inclusion 
and since no argument can be vicious which is true to this 
principle they are disposed to accept it as an easy test by 
which without reference to mood and figure the correctness 
of every syllogism however complex may be ascertained 

 as was the case anterior to the time of galileo see ante 

pp and arnauld and nicol see art de penser part iii 
ch ii 



c iii tjkiyeesal test of syllogisms 

thus on being required to snow that every vicious man is 
unhappy we first endeavour to find a more evident proposi 
tion in which this is implicitly contained as every man who 
is the slave of his passions is unhappy containing proposi 
tion but as this does not include the judgment which is 
sought to be established expressly we interpolate another 
proposition to show that the containing proposition unde 
niably includes what we desire to prove as every vicious 
man is the slave of his passions applicative proposition 
the syllogism would consequently be 

every one who is the slave of his passions is unhappy 
every vicious man is the slave of his passions 
therefore every vicious man is unhappy 

in affirmative syllogisms it is frequently optional which 
premiss is assumed to be the containing or applicative proposi 
tion as each will contain the conclusion in such case only in 
a different sphere the major in that of extension the minor 
in the counter one of comprehension thus in the above 
example the subject of the conclusion vicious is con 
tained under the extension of the subject of the major 
 slave of his passions and the minor shows this but the 
minor contains it likewise since slave of his passions 
comprehends in its idea that of unhappy as the major 
indicates as the major however is nearly always the more 
general proposition it may be commonly regarded as the 
containing proposition and the minor only the applicative 

in negative syllogisms the affirmative proposition whether 
major or minor will be the least general and consequently 
will form exclusively the applicative proposition as in the 
argument 

every happy man is content 

no miser is content 

therefore no miser is happy 

it is more natural to say that the minor contains the conclu 
sion and that the major which is affirmative proves the in 
clusion than contrariwise for the minor separating miser 
from content excludes it also from the term happy since 
that attribute according to the major is wholly contained 
under the extension of content 



 kinds op stllogisms b iii 

 conditional syllogisms 

there are other kinds of syllogisms corresponding to the 
different forms which the major proposition may assume and 
as this gives the name to the syllogism of which it forms a 
part the latter may be said to admit in some sort of the same 
multiform division as propositions themselves we have 
already dealt with that class of them which are simple in 
complex and complex we proceed now to deal with com 
pound syllogisms and take as the first in order that species 
which is termed conditional 

these may be defined to be syllogisms in which the major 
is a conditional proposition containing the entire conclusion 
for example 

if matter cannot move of itself its first motion must 
have been given to it by a spiritual being 

but matter cannot move of itself 

therefore its first movement must have been given to it 
by a spiritual being 

since the consequent may be inferred from the concession 
of the antecedent and the denial of the antecedent from 
the negation of the consequent we get two corresponding 
kinds of conditional syllogisms the affirmative being called 
constructive the negative destructive for instance in the 
proposition if the crops are bad corn must be dear 
should the antecedent be conceded the first case applies and 
the consequent may be inferred the argument would conse 
quently be 

if the crops are bad corn must be dear 
but the crops are bad 
therefore corn is dear 

this conditional is constructive but if the consequent is 
denied the second case applies and the syllogism emerges in 
a destructive form thus 

if any increase of population is desirable some misery is 

desirable 

but no misery is desirable 

therefore some increase of population is not desirable 

hence conditional syllogisms in addition to being faulty as 

to matter when the condition is irrational can with respect 

 see ante p 



c iii compound syllogisms 

to form be defective in two ways viz when we attempt to 
infer anything from the affirmation of the consequent or the 
denial of the antecedent for it is obvious from the conces 
sion of the consequent we can infer nothing since the 
same consequent may follow from other antecedents as in 
the above example corn may be dear from other causes 
besides a failure in the harvest therefore it does not follow 
from corn being dear that the harvest has failed in like 
manner we cannot infer from the denial of the antece 
dent viz that the crops are not bad that they are not dear 

yet arguments in which the latter fallacies are used are 
occasionally made to assume a very plausible shape thus 

if such an administration had involved the country in 
war it would have been a bad administration 

but it did not involve the country in war 

therefore it was not a bad administration 
or 

if i refused to meet my liabilities i should be a bad 
member of society 

but i do not refuse to meet my liabilities 

therefore i am not a bad member of society 
these we need not say are arguments which prove nothing 
since a bad member of society and maladministration may 
arise from various other sources besides those assigned 
when however there is an exclusion either understood or 
expressed in the major no objection can be taken to this 
kind of inference as in ciceros defence of muraena 

i could then only be accused with justice of acting 
contrary to my law if i maintained that muraena purchased 
the votes and was justified in doing so but i maintain 
that he did not buy the votes therefore i do nothing con 
trary to the law 

the same may be said of the argument urged in the follow 
ing passage of the eneid 
 si sine pace tua atque invito numine trees 

italiam petiere luant pecata neque illos 

juveris auxilio sin tot responsa secuti 

quaa superi manesque dabant cur nunc tua quisquam 

vertere jussa potest aut cur nova condere fata 

 o r at pro l muraena c iii ramus cites it as an example of bad 
reasoning but he is evidently in error neid x

tor supplying the exclusive term in the major the reason 
ing may be thus rendered 

if the trojans had come into italy contrary to the will of 
the gods they would then alone have been punishable 

but they came not contrary to the will of the gods 

therefore they are not punishable 

if the exclusive term however could not be established the 
argument would be nugatory these syllogisms may be 
changed into a categorical by the reduction of the major to 
that form 

 disjunctive syllogisms 

those syllogisms are disjunctive whose major contains a 
disjunctive proposition whose object is to state an alter 
nate which leaves us at liberty either by denying one part 
to infer the other or by affirming one part to reject the re 
maining of the first kind ciceros argument may be taken 
as an example 

those who have slain caesar are either parricides or 
defenders of liberty 

they are not parricides 

therefore they are defenders of liberty 
but it is not necessary that the alternative should be re 
stricted to two terms it may lie between several as 

all sciences are either pure inductive or mixed sciences 

but astronomy is not a pure or an inductive science 

it is therefore a mixed science 
gibbons argument may serve as an instance of the second 

mahomet was either an enthusiast or an impostor 

but he was an enthusiast 

therefore he was not an impostor 

disjunctives are rarely defective unless through the weak 
ness of the alternative which leaves a mean between the 
opposed members this indeed occurs in the last syllogism 
for there is nothing so antagonistic in the nature of an en 
thusiast and impostor as to prevent them being combined in 
the same person even at the same time as was undoubtedly 
the case with mahomet of course when both members of 
the major are true we are not authorised from the denial or 
affirmation of the one to infer anything with regard to the 
other but only when the members are exclusive 
 see ante p 



c iii compound syllogisms 

 copulative syllogisms 

these syllogisms are only another form of disjunctives 
with the alternative expressed in the major by the copulative 
conjunction at the same time and instead of either 
or for example 

a government cannot be at the same time despotic and 
the licenser of a free press 

but the english government permits a free press 

therefore the english government is not despotic 
now granting the truth of the matter in the above syllo 
gism it is evident we can only from the concession of one 
part deny the other but cannot conclude anything from the 
denial of one part otherwise we might argue 

a government cannot be at the same time despotic and 
the licenser of a free press 

but the english government is not the licenser of a 
free press 

therefore the english government is despotic 
which of course would be absurd since despotism may arise 
from a variety of other circumstances besides the violation of 
freedom of discussion and because matters may occasionally 
take such a course as to warrant the present government to 
place restrictions on the press with a view to preserve 
even liberty 

 the dilemma 

a syllogism with a conditional major in which either the 
antecedent or the consequent is disjunctive is called a 
dilemma thus the argument of divines against temporal 
felicity may be expressed in this form 

man can only be truly happy on earth by yielding to 
his passions or by combating them 

but either of these courses is attended with pain 

man cannot therefore on earth be truly happy 
neither antecedent or consequent however is restricted to a 
double member as the word dilemma implies but either or 

 which some mr disraeli are disposed to contest the 

word literally signifies double proposition hence the common ex 
pression of the two horns of a dilemma but the popular meaning 
of the term arises from the condition of some one of the antecedents 
being true or one of the consequents false though we cannot say which 
is so 



 kinds of syllogisms b iii 

even both may be compound to any degree as in the argu 
ment of st augustine 

if children suffer misery it must be either st as 

the consequence of sin committed in a previous life 

or nd the impotence of god who has not the 

power to prevent it or rd the injustice of god 

who inflicts it without a cause or th original sin 

but it is impious to allege the three first causes 

therefore the misery of children is to be attributed to 

original sin 

or if the major premiss have a compound antecedent with 
a simple consequent the latter may be aflirmed of any one 
member of the antecedent disjunctively granted as 

whether the soul perish with the body or survive it in 

the same or another form death is to be feared 
but either of these cases will happen 
therefore death is to be feared 

but should the different members of the antecedent have 
each its separate consequent then each member of the ante 
cedent being as before disjunctively granted the consequent 
can be only disjunctively inferred for example 

if ieschines joined in the public rejoicings he is incon 
sistent if he did not he is unpatriotic but he either 
joined or not therefore he is either unpatriotic or 
inconsistent 

the forms already given which end in affirmative infer 
ence are generally termed constructive there are however 
others of a negative kind in which having denied the whole 
of the consequent or consequents we deny the correspond 
ing antecedent these are termed destructive thus 
if despotic governments are conducive to the welfare 
of society then the restriction of individual rights 
the publication of arbitrary enactments and the re 
straint of public opinion is beneficial 
but none of these are beneficial 

therefore despotic governments are not conducive to 
the welfare of society 

 a belief of some pagan philosopher the argument of 

demosthenes in the de corona 



c iii pbinciples of the dilemma 

there are many dilemmas in which the proposition con 
taining the alternative is understood being sufficiently in 
dicated by the statement of each particular part of which it 
consists thus the argument urged by antisthenes that 
we ought not to meddle with the affairs of the state 
which seems to have had great influence upon some of the 
ancient philosophers 

if we conduct the affairs of state well we shall offend 
men 

if we conduct them id we shall offend the gods 

therefore it is not expedient to engage in them 
of the same kind is the argument of bias quoted by aulus 
gellius in defence of the bachelorate 

if a wife is beautiful she excites jealousy 

if she be ordinary she disgusts e 

therefore it is best not to marry 
in such cases the omitted proposition should be supplied 
before the force of the dilemma is tested as it may entirely 
invalidate the conclusiveness of its matter thus the 
dilemma of antisthenes when fully expressed would require 
as its major 

 it is not expedient to engage in state affairs if we 
either displease god or men 

a proposition which bears the falsity of its matter on the face 
of it pursuing the same course the universal proposition 
to the dilemma of bias would be 
it is not wise to marry if a woman creates jealousy or 
disgust 

a proposition which even if admitted would not establish 
the conclusion since many beautiful women so comport 
themselves as to leave no room for jealousy and many ordi 
nary ones possess qualities of mind which cannot fail to 
please all who approach them hence it is obvious with 
regard to the matter of dilemmas that each particular con 
clusion should be necessary and that the dividing member 
should comprehend the entire subject to which they apper 
tain 

as dilemmas belong to the class of compound conditionals 
they are reducible to two or three simple syllogisms of that 



 kittds of syllogisms b iii 

kind and the validity of their form may be tested by the 
same rules thus the dilemma if a man be wicked or 
insane he is unfit for society a criminal is either of these 
two for if he knew the consequences of his act he was wicked 
if he did not he was insane therefore he is unfit for society 
may be resolved into two simple conditional syllogisms in 
which wicked will form the attribute of one minor premiss 
and insane of the other dilemmas consequently admit of 
being stated like pure conditionals in a categorical form 
as 

the case of a being jb is a case of c being d or e 
being f 

this is not a case of c being z or e being f 

therefore it is not a ease of a being b 
in the same manner constructive dilemmas may be reduced 
to categoricals and if needs be tested by the general rules 
of the canon 

 the chain syllogism or sorites 

when a series of inferences occur in such order as to 
make the predicate of one proposition the subject of the next 
till the attribute of the last of the premises is predicated in 
the concluding proposition of the subject of the first we have 
what is termed a sorites thus a is b g is d d is e 
therefore a is j where the mind passes from proposition 
to proposition without expressing the conclusion until it 
reaches the attribute which it seeks to connect with the sub 
ject of the first proposition of this kind of argument we 
cannot adopt a better illustration than one given by lord 
eldon on the occasion of laurences injunction concerning 
the pirated edition of his book on the natural history of 
man i have a rational doubt whether some portion of this 
book do not lean to materialism what leans to materialism 
is inconsistent with the immortality of the soul what is in 
consistent with the immortality of the soul is contrary to 
scripture but as that which contradicts scripture does not 
come under the protection of the law i have a rational doubt 

 or accumulating argument from the greek oapbs a heap though 
we must confess the german name kettenschluss which we have adopted 
is more significant 



c hi the chaik syllogism 

whether the injunction can be maintained therefore the 
injunction is dissolved 

it will be observed that each intermediate proposition 
between the first and last contains a middle term of the 
sorites which on that account is capable of being drawn 
out into as many distinct syllogisms in the major of the 
first syllogism the second proposition of the sorites must 
be taken while the first proposition will form the minor 
premiss and to each succeeding syllogism the conclusion 
of its predecessor will form the second premiss hence 
the first proposition in the sorites is the only minor premiss 
which is expressed prom this we may conclude that the 
first proposition alone of all the premises can be particular 
because in the first figure into which the reasoning of the 
sorites falls the minor may be particular but not the major 
and all the other propositions anterior to the conclusion are 
major premises it may likewise be inferred that in a sorites 
there can be but one negative premiss and that the last for 
none other could be negative without involving contrary to 
the rule of the first figure the implied syllogism in a nega 
tive minor 

a sorites may be exhibited in two ways by reversing the 
order of the premises in the examples already given thus 
d is e c is d jb is c a is b therefore a is e in this 
form which is called the groclenien from the name of its 
originator extension is more conspicuous as the sorites 
starts from its two widest terms while in the common form 
intension predominates the former descends in extension 
from the predicate to the conclusion the latter ascends in 
intension from the subject 

it may be remarked that a chain of conditional syllogisms 
may be expressed in either of these forms thus if educa 
tion be indispensable to the progressive development of so 
ciety it is important that it should be well conducted if 
it is important it should be well conducted an order of men 
should be strictly trained for that purpose under the surveil 
lance of the state but education is essential c therefore 
an order of men should be strictly trained c of course 
if the sorites were destructive the procedure would as 
sume the goclenien form and we must go back from the

denial of the last consequent to the denial of the first ante 
cedent 

 of the enthymeme or imperfect syllogism 

it is usual for logicians to denote one or two abridged 
forms of arguments commonly called enthymemes and pro 
syllogisms though as these distinctions only arise from 
accidental forms of expression there is no reason for their 
admission into logic any more than a score of others of the 
same kind which might be mentioned the enthymeme is 
usually called a syllogism with one premiss suppressed but 
as all the terms are comprised in the conclusion and the ex 
pressed premiss the one omitted is commonly understood 
and may be readily supplied thus victoria is a sovereign 
who respects the forms of the constitution therefore her 
subjects are free the major premiss wanting to make the 
syllogism conclusive from the form of expression is the 
subjects of every sovereign who respects the forms of the 
constitution are free but this is so easily understood as 
to be dispensed with in the ordinary usage of language 

when one of the premises of a syllogism is itself an en 
thymeme the concluding clause of that premiss is termed a 
prosyllogism as the bracketed line in the argument 

everything which concerns the public weal ought to be 

under the control of the legislature 
but education is such since property cannot be secure 

without it 
therefore education ought to be under the control of 

the legislature 

sometimes the conclusion of the syllogism in common par 
lance furnishes a species of premiss from which a second con 
clusion is deduced in which case the last proposition is 
termed an episyllogism a statesman who involved the 
country in great debts could not be a good financier pitt 
involved the country in great debts therefore he was a bad 
financier and therefore he is unworthy of indiscriminate

when the truth of either premiss or both in a syllogism 
is not intuitively evident other arguments are required to 
establish its validity which gives rise to what are called 
trains of reasoning or combinations of inference an ex 
ample of this kind has already been furnished in the sorites 
which is nothing else than a series of syllogisms stript of 
the minor which is easily understood and so arranged as to 
connect an attribute or property with the subject of the first 
propositions apparently foreign to it through a group of 
inferences in which the connexion is intuitively discerned 
thus restoring the suppressed premiss in each of the in 
ferences drawn by lord eldon in the illustration already 
cited we should get the following train of reasoning what 
ever contradicts scripture is contrary to law this book con 
tradicts scripture therefore it is contrary to law though 
the major and minor premiss would be contested by a civilian 
of the present day in lord eld on s opinion the latter was 
only open to cavil and he consequently sought to place it 
beyond dispute by an additional inference whatever leans 
to materialism contradicts scripture this book leans to 
materialism therefore it contradicts scripture but the 
phrase leans to materialism is rather indefinite and it 
might be fairly argued that the natural history of man 
did not fall within its sphere the judge therefore proceeds 
to clench his argument by placing the book in the category 
of things that lean to materialism because it contradicts the 
immortality of the soul we in this manner obtain two syl 
logisms in corroboration of the minor premiss of the first 
argument such combinations of inference it is evident will 
grow more complex and involved in proportion as the two 
terms of the conclusion is removed from the middle in the 
syllogism whose validity we seek to establish as the farther 
the distance the more numerous will the intermediate links 
become through which the connexion is demonstrated 

these trains of reasoning exemplify certain laws and 



 gekebal pbzstciples of ineeeekce b iv 

methods are employed about different degrees of belief and 
rest upon various foundations of evidence each of these 
divisions developed in corresponding chapters will form the 
subject of the present book in this view it will only be 
preliminary to the great design of logic viz the repre 
sentation of the valid forms of inference employed in the 
construction of the moral and physical sciences and will 
serve to use a baconian phrase as a kind of prodromi or 
anticipations of those principles of evidence to which all the 
preceding parts of logic converge from the exposition of 
the laws of simple cases of inference to that of the multiform 
functions which they fulfil in the construction of the two great 
branches of knowledge is manifestly too wide a step to be 
taken at once and it is but consulting the methodical expan 
sion of the science to interpose between them a survey of the 
different grounds of evidence on which those inferences rest 
the primitive truths into which they can be resolved together 
with the laws and methods which they exemplify and the 
various degrees of belief which they excite in the subjective 

 the common school logics generally terminate with the first mem 
ber of this division viz method and leave the young logician in total 
ignorance of the mental laws which the theory of reasoning is supposed 
to illustrate of the foundations upon which it is raised and the 
different forms which demonstration and induction assume in the 
various sciences to which the preceding subjects are subsidiary such 
a procedure which is not an unapt illustration of the play of hamlet 
with the part of the prince omitted doubtless arose from the 
common habit of teaching the science in our universities before 
a course of physics was entered upon but we hope after mr 
mills system of logic the abuse will be corrected if logic 
both in the continental and our home universities is deemed an 
essential propadeutic to the study of theology and ethics it must be 
deemed equally necessary to the study of natural philosophy in 
both cases we have distinct groups of knowledge raised out of 
various combinations of inference and if it is essential in the pur 
suit of the moral sciences to have the general principles upon which 
the evidence proceeds in our grasp before we proceed to master the 
particular details the same course ought to be pursued in physics 
hence sir john herschel has very properly made this subject one of 
the leading divisions of his preliminary discourse on the study of 
natural philosophy dugald stewart philos of the mind passim 
however thought logic ought to follow and not precede the study of 
the sciences a view in which dr whewell seems to coincide by making 
their philosophy supplementary to their history we notwithstanding 
deem this opinion a very erroneous one 



c i analysis and synthesis 

mind that the reader may be presented not only with all the 
mechanism of the formulae of reasoning but have a clear 
insight into the structure of knowledge which they are em 
ployed to raise and a complete view of the foundations upon 
which the edifice reposes in pursuit of each branch of the 
subject we shall have to encounter two objections of a very 
formidable character either of which if admitted would 
prove fatal to the system of logic propounded in this work 
the first is that which resolves all our knowledge into a series 
of inductive generalisations with its two necessary corollaries 
viz that the interpolation of the major premiss in a syllogism 
is an assumption of the thing to be proved petitio principii 
and that there is no such thing as necessary truth existing 
unless what is of hypothetical creation the second is that 
which denies the existence of anything like certainty either 
in reasoning or in the first principles that inference assumes 
and which consequently attempts to rase every scientific 
structure to the ground the answer to these objections 
will bring into court everything connected with the rationale 
of evidence and expose every artifice that human ingenuity 
has contrived to convict its methods of falsehood and illusion 



chaptee i 

universal methods of infebence 

 analysis and synthesis 

keflection cannot be exercised and consequently no 
modes of reasoning be pursued without viewing the object 
about which they are employed in either of two ways viz as 
an obscure whole whose parts are to be resolved or as a group 
of detached parts to be linked together in the form of a con 
stituted whole the first process is called analysis from a 
greek word signifying decomposition the last synthesis 
from a term derived from the same source designating re 
composition these are the two vital functions of methods 
the two essential accompaniments of all thought as systole 

 for the different modes of analysis see history of logic pp 
and 



 analysis and synthesis fi it 

and deastole are the living conditions of the animal or 
ganism 

this will be more evident on interrogating ourselves as to 
the nature of truth in what else can it consist unless in 
the relation of things to each other and by what other mode 
can that relation be investigated unless by mounting from 
their primitive elements to their successive combinations or 
by descending from these to the simple parts out of which 
they arise nature by the process of growth and decom 
position going on within her is continually weaving and un 
ravelling the complicated web of existence and in whatever 
position the threads may be placed they can assume no other 
relation than that of combination synthesis or disentangle 
ment analysis 

although each of these methods vary in some degree ac 
cording to the subjectmatter of the different sciences in 
which they are employed they nevertheless preserve in their 
widest diversity those distinctive features which mark them 
out as varieties of one species and as such may be used to illus 
trate each other thus logical analysis by which a process of 
inference is resolved into syllogisms and syllogisms into pro 
positions and then again into the two terms and copula 
which form the connecting link or by which any of these parts 
may be again resolved into the divisions which we have already 
comprised under them is perfectly analogous to the ana 
lysis which the chemist employs to get at the ingredients of 
any mixture in his laboratory or to that which geometricians 
make use of when they convict any theorem of falsity by 
pointing out the ridiculous inferences to which the assump 
tion of its truth must lead the same may be said of the 
various synthetic processes which obtain in the different 
sciences as these are but the inverse methods of the cor 
responding analysis out of which they arise and consequently 
manifest in the same degree an opposite unity of method 
distinct however as the two paths are by which the stream 
of knowledge is either descended to its source or pursued 
out into the wide arm which unites all its tributary branches 
they are commonly more or less blended in every large train 
of inference and where the investigation is of such a nature 
as to allow either of the methods to predominate they are 
sometimes confounded together through the process re 



c i symbolical proof how fab analytic 

ceiving the name of the prevailing method thus sym 
bolical reasoning is generally termed analytic because we 
do not necessarily here as in geometrical reasoning proceed 
by linking one truth to another till we reach the desired 
result but commence with stating the unelicited truth or 
the given combination of known quantities in its symbolical 
form and then proceed in conformity with certain axioms 
to trace what other truths are involved in the one first stated 
resolving step by step the symbolical assertion with which 
we began into others which gradually reveal the meaning of 
the unknown quantities which entered into the original 
statement now the first process which consists in forming 
out of the quantities presented by the conditions of the ques 
tion one equation is evidently synthetic while the subse 
quent steps of the proof is analytic but as the latter com 
prise the main branch of the procedure all symbolical rea 
soning became confounded with it 

with regard to the relative value of these two methods 
that must be determined according to the subject which pre 
sents itself for investigation in physical science it is evi 
dent there can be no correct synthesis before analysis has 
legitimated the use of that method inasmuch as we can boast 
of no revelations of the mysteries of nature but those which 
arise from anatomising the interwoven mass of facts which 
she presents and acquainting ourselves with the mutual 
bearings of their distinct parts thus how vain would 
have been the attempt to manufacture lapislazuli until we 
had discovered that the components of the stone were silica r 
alumina soda sulphur and a trace of iron or to seek to 
discover at least without a number of wasteful experiments 
at what point of space the curved path of a given shot will 
terminate before examining the laws which the cannonball 
obeys from the first moment the match has been applied 
we might indeed in the first instance have accidentally 
thrown together the five components of ultramarine in the 
exact proportion required to produce the beautiful pigment 
referred to but such an instance would have given us no 
power to produce the combination at will and still left us 
dependent on the niggardly supplies which nature doles out 

 as did really occur in in a furnace used for the manufacture 
of alkali 



 analysis aih syitthesis it 

of this beautiful material by chemical analysis however 
we have wrung out of nature one of her important secrets 
and are thus enabled verifying a prediction of lord bacon 
to produce frequently what she does rarely and to achieve in 
a moment results which she takes centuries to consummate 

in physical science y therefore the legitimacy of all syn 
thesis is in direct proportion to the preceding analysis if 
we attempt to synthesise or construct a system of science 
before the analysis of the parts to which it refers is complete 
the result is a false science just as if we rest content with 
simple analysis and do not attempt its corresponding syn 
thesis as far as its data would warrant such a procedure the 
result is an incomplete knowledge but if an error is to be 
committed the latter course is much preferable to the for 
mer as an analysis one day or other is sure to find its syn 
thesis while if we commence with synthesis there is no 
return to the true path unless through the demolition of the 
vague hypothesis which such unwarranted synthesis has con 
structed of this truth the history of science is nothing less 
than a series of illustrations aristotle through leaping at 
inference before a complete analysis of the facts upon which 
his mind was employed affirmed that the matter of the sun 
was incorruptible and the falsity of the assertion was not 
detected until the examination of the suns disk by means of 
the telescope discovered spots in that luminary ptolemy 
with a very incomplete analysis of celestial phenomena at 
tempted to construct the whole theory of celestial mechanics 
the result was that astronomy for nearly fourteen hundred 
years was kept embedded in the ruck of fiction and could not 
advance until the orbs and epicycles with which he had peo 
pled space were swept away and the analysis recommenced 
from the point at which it had been broken off thus the 
entire course of philosophy has been no other than that of 
analysis with synthesis following in its train and the im 
pediments which have constantly beset its path have sprung 
from no other source than the rash commencement of such 
synthesis before the corresponding analysis was made out 

the contrary principle however may be said to obtain in 
all cases where law and revelation are concerned concerning 
either particular doctrines or individual acts for then we 
arrive at results not through the dissection of the matter to 
which they refer but by linking successive cases to each 



c i subjecthatteb of synthesis 

other in conformity with the laws enunciated in the revealed 
proposition everything consequently must be made to meet 
the truth which it expressed either directly in itself or by its 
immediate consequences as coming from an impugnable 
authority and hence arises the opinion that not alone in 
the moral sciences but in every complete system of knowledge 
which professes to trace the relations of all science to each 
other and their mutual blendings and ramifications the 
synthetic element must predominate and give the tone to the 
rest this ground however is of too uncertain a character 
to warrant any kind of dogmatism and the best course to 
pursue is that of conceding to each of the two great branches 
of knowledge the predominance of their correlative methods 
while we refrain from thrusting forward a probable inference 
in one department as sufficient ground for oversetting a legi 
timate conclusion in the other 

as in revelation we are not said to discover general laws 
but merely infer cases from laws already given the synthetic 
process which is its method is not said to discover truth but 
only to demonstrate it when discovered while that of ana 
lysis which prevails in the physical sciences brings new 
truths to light both with regard to particular facts and the 
general laws which are shown to arise out of them both 
therefore may serve as verificatory processes to test each 
others legitimacy since as truth is always in unison with 
itself a fact which has only been analytically inferred is 
doubly confirmed when found to be in accordance with moral 
truth and to stand the test of the correlative method as a 
principle must shine forth with clearer lustre when it derives 
renewed confirmation from the analytic examination of par 
ticular facts there is consequently no fundamental oppo 
sition between the two methods nor can they ever be viewed 
as conflicting unless from an erroneous conception of the 
nature of the sciences and the uses to which they are applied 

though the direction of these methods must depend in a 

 propounded by gioberti in his elementi dello studio di filosofia 
torn ii cap ii and covertly stated by chretien in his work on logical 
method p these writers in this case are only the exponent of 
the views advocated by catholic theologians both at oxford and rome 
but all the experimentalists and eclectics with victor cousin at their 
head condemn this view see itntroduction a la cours de phistoire

 induction and deduction meaning of the terms 

if any train of reasoning be minutely examined it will be 
found to proceed either in a descent from the more general 
to the more particular resolving a whole into its parts 
analysis or in an ascent from the more particular to the 
more general or framing out of the particular parts a consti 
tuted whole synthesis the former is called deduction the 
latter induction thus the physical sciences are commonly 
called inductive because they consist of a series of generali 
sations founded on the most circumstantially stated particu 
lars and carried up through intermediate axioms to universal 
laws which comprehend in their statement every subordinate 
degree of generality while the abstract sciences are usually 

 which may be either of intension or extension sir w hamilton 
restricts it to the former see ed kev vol ivii but he is evidently in 
error 



c ii their delation to each othee 

termed deductive because they follow the inverse method of 
proceeding from general axioms to particulars by which these 
axioms are traced back to their remote consequences and all 
the particular results deduced from them which are included 
in the general proposition of course each branch of know 
ledge not only admits but even exacts as the condition of its 
perfection the blending of the two methods but they are 
generally so designated as one or the other element predomi 
nates in the proof and fashions its initiatory processes 

every inductive train of inference as well as deductive is 
capable of being resolved into its appropriate syllogisms and 
is consequently amenable to the laws of the universal canon 
of reasoning the only difference between the two forms in 
this respect being that though the former equally ranges 
through all the figures it finds its most natural expression 
in the third while its deductive counterpart finds its most 
direct form in the first by employing the same symbols 
the correlation of the two processes may be thus exemplified 
inductive deductive 

x y z are a b is a 

x y z represent the class b x y z are contained in b 
 b is a x y z are a 

or or 

a contains x y z a contains b 

x y z constitute b b contains x y z 

 a contains b a contains x y z 

in the syllogisms the order of the terms remains un 
changed but that of the propositions is reversed the con 
clusion of the one forming the major premiss of the other 
of the terms the major is common to both but the middle 
term in the deductive syllogism becomes the minor in the 
inductive and the individuals which are the minor or deter 
mined notion in the deductive syllogism become the middle 
term or determining notion in the corresponding inductive 
syllogism the one process according to this view is only 
an inverted counterpart of the other 

 mr karslake estimating the inductive by the deductive syllogism 
restricts the former to the rd fig the scheme of sir w hamilton in 
the text presents the more correct doctrine see aids to the study of

 induction and deduction b it 

 different kinds of induction formal and material 
syllogism erroneously confounded ivith deduction 

much confusion of thought has arisen through the absence 
of distinction between the matter and form of induction and 
the propagation of the error thence resulting that because 
it proceeds in an inverted method to deduction and is 
generically applied to designate a distinct class of truths it 
must necessarily denote a species of inference not contem 
plated by the founder of logic a view which is countenanced 
by the fact that in the days when the laws of the syllogism 
were evolved no such thing as inductive science could be 
supposed to exist hence that class of moderns who like 
bacon and dugald stewart will admit of no other correct 
elementary process than induction are led to throw aside the 
syllogistic doctrine both as practically useless and as an im 
perfect exposition of the theory of inference 

seems to have had a correct idea of induction when he affirmed it to be 
a syllogism in which the major is proved of the middle by means of the 
minor etraycoyrj fjev ovv kai e evaywys irvaaoytcrios to ia tov

this extract clearly shows that bacon was entirely ignorant of the 
principles he condemns or he could not have written middle propositions 
for middle terms or urged as a reason for the rejection of the school 
logic the singular fact that it was open to the illusion of language for 
what reasoning is not bacon in this extract rejects middle terms as 
useless yet he could not reason without them and was necessarily as 
unsparing in their use as st thomas aquinas 

a great deal of the current notions about the inutility of logic springs 
from the confusion which such loose writing tends to involve the old 
and new methods we have seen a graduate escape from the hard 
necessity of allowing himself to be convinced that he was arguing with 
a middle term particular in both premises by declaring that facts were 
better than syllogisrr irhen the forms of his argument would have 
proved that men are ipdants because they require air i he ex 
claimed produce facts like bacon you quibble about their combina

c ii views of the jlntllents and modebns 

the error appears to us to have arisen in a great degree 
from the application of the term induction to the process in 
which there is really no illative inference at all viz the 
objective process of investigating particular facts as prepara 
tory to illation which is entirely intuitive and also from 
imagining because the truths arrived at by the process of 
illative induction are ordinarily tested by certain experimen 
tal canons of inquiry and the laws of the calculus that it is 
entirely foreign to the class of truths which the syllogistic 
theory contemplates the confusion however will disappear 
on considering that the syllogism after all only presents a 
mode in which an inference may be tested as to the conclu 
siveness of its form and that for this purpose its mechanism 
is quite as available for inductive as for deductive reasoning 
in all cases where an illative inference has been drawn now 
if a train of reasoning can err on its formal side as well as 
with respect to its matter it is surely no good reason to 
infer because we are provided with a code of principles by 
which the latter may be tested that we are quite at liberty 
to neglect the rules which relate to the correctness of the 
formal illation 

in both these respects with regard to induction the 
ancients and moderns appear to have entertained inverse mis 
conceptions bacon and his followers have marvellously 
advanced the doctrine of material induction but have entirely 
mistaken the import of its formal laws and the functions 
they are calculated to discharge aristotle on the other 
hand was right with respect to the form while in relation 
to material induction or the mode of obtaining the materials 
and determining under what circumstances certain indi 
viduals could be said to constitute or represent a class he 
was obviously in error for though in addition to the in 
duction per enumerationem simplicem or that which required 
every individual of a class to be tried before they could be 
affirmed to constitute a class he seemed to admit the induc 
tion of a class from a few of the objects which it embraced 
founded on the general analogies of nature neither he or 
his followers had any distinct conception of the kind of evi 

 aristotle attributes the discovery of induction to socrates deriving 
the word eirayuyr from the socratic accumulation of instances serv 
ing as antecedents to establish the requisite conclusion

dence required to warrant such induction but from a few or 
a single instance and even more frequently from no instance 
at all but only from some fancied analogy they jumped at a 
universal law and strove to submit nature to the fanciful 
hypothesis thus obtained by concealing every objection 
calculated to weaken or overthrow it the moderns with 
bacon at their head therefore justly allege that in 
stead of proceeding from wellgrounded particulars through 
the platform of intermediate axioms up to general laws 
they rushed up to axiomata summa and then attempted 
to deduce the axiomata media by which they ought to 
have ascended a method which of course involved them 
in undue assumption and proved the source of irretrievable 
error 

as an instance of the mistake of the moderns with regard 
to formal induction in addition to those already given may 
be cited the attempt to identify syllogism with deduction 
and the reduction of reasoning in the inductive form to the 
first figure with a view to show that all reasoning is syllo 
gistic in the deductive sense of the term aldrich describes 
induction as a kind of enthymeme or syllogism in barbara 
with its minor suppressed viz this that and the other 
magnet attract iron therefore all magnets attract iron 
though the illustration he gives if thrown into a syllogistic 
form would really require a major to be supplied and not a 
minor thus 

whatever belongs to this that and the other magnet 
belongs to all 

attracting iron belongs to this that and the other 
magnet 

therefore attracting iron belongs to all 

we are consequently obliged to infer that he inverted the 
premises in which case the inference would be unintel 
ligible 

archbishop whately on the other hand takes the sup 
pressed member of the syllogism in induction to be the major 
and reduces that method of inference to the deductive form 
in the following manner 

 see karslakes aids to the study of logic vol i p artis 
logicae kudimenta p whatelys logic b iv c i 



c ii in what eespects independent 

whatever belongs to the individuals we have examined 

belongs certainly or probably as the case may be 

to the class under which they come 
sheep deer and other individuals deficient in upper 

cutting teeth are found to ruminate 
therefore all animals deficient in upper cutting teeth 

ruminate 

although many instances of induction like the ones ad 
duced may be exhibited in a deductive form yet this does 
not prove that all can nor does the transformation add to 
the cogency of the inductive inference but rather weakens 
its force by representing it in an unnatural manner thus 

sir thomas more was incorruptible 

sir thomas more was a judge 

therefore some judge or judges are incorruptible 

would appear in the first figure as 

sir thomas more was incorruptible 
some judge was sir thomas more 
therefore some judge is incorruptible 

in which form there is not one trace of deduction nor is the 
inference strengthened but despoiled of much of the illative 
force it bore in the third figure there is consequently no 
object to be gained in such reduction since each figure has 
its own particular rules for testing the validity of every argu 
ment that falls within its confines and none of the dicta so 
far as certainty is concerned exercises a prerogative over the 
rest as long as the dictum de omni et nullo was considered 
as the paramount law of correct inference there was some 
pretext for reducing all arguments to one of the four moods 
of the first figure to which that dictum is alone applicable 
and considering deduction as identical with syllogism but 
since that view has been disclaimed there is as much reason 
and some think far more reason as we shall presently see 
for resolving all deduction into the inductive process as there 
is for the contrary procedure 

 theories of seasoning 

the false views which arose from making deduction 
synonymous with syllogism have invited attacks from dif

ferent quarters on the whole doctrine of the school logic 
which though varying in some degree in their form re 
semble each other so far in their general features as to de 
note a common origin 

facies non omnibus una 

nee diversa tamen qualem decet esse sororum 
and consequently admit of being dealt with in an aggregate 
form the common principle from which they spring may 
be traced to the assumption that all axioms are but gene 
ralisations from particular facts that there are no such 
things existing as a priori truths given as kant would say 
as ultimate principles of our intellectual constitution and 
the consequent corodary that all inference is from particu 
lars to particulars and that general propositions being mere 
registers of such inferences when interpolated in an argu 
ment add nothing to the proof but simply refresh our 
memories with the number of cases in which the law we are 
about to apply to a new instance has been already observed 
thus when it is inferred from the fact of the present pre 
mier being a man that he must die the major premiss from 
which we infer the conclusion is not all men are mortal for 
that would involve a petitio princvpii but simply the number 
of particular cases in which we have observed mortality to be 
a mark of the class men nor is the formula of previous 
instances in which the inference has been drawn necessary 
to be looked at on all occasions as there are a great quantity 
of particular inferences evident from the bare statement of 
the minor we would not require in order to affirm that 
the lines a f and b c from being equal to m n are 
equal to each other to recur to former cases in which we 
had observed the truth of the axiom that things which are 
equal to the same thing are equal to each other the bare 
enunciation of propositions of this character is sufficiently 
evident of itself without any previous generalisation to carry 

 met b ii this is mr mills view but dr brown will 
not even concede so much but affirms it is only necessary to know 
that mortality is associated with the idea of man to predicate that 
quality of any individual thus prince albert is a man therefore 
prince albert is mortal but the doctor does not seem to have been 
aware that the knowledge of mortality being an essential constituent of 
mans nature previous to making the inference was in reality the very 
assumption of the major premiss all men are mortal which he so 
stoutly ignored

conviction to the most undisciplined understanding as soon 
as they are understood the syllogistic theory therefore is 
not the universal type of reasoning but inference from par 
ticulars to particulars through marks of marks the conclu 
sion of an inference not being drawn from a general pro 
position even when it may be advisable to consult it by way 
of collateral security but according to it such general 
proposition cannot be considered as the real antecedent or 
premiss but the particular facts from which that general 
proposition was inferred accordingly the rules of the syl 
logism and in fact every artifice which the peripatetic 
logic embraces beyond absolute definition is perfectly use 
less in the sense of the scotch school and the work should 
be at once sent to the trunkmakers were it not as well for 
the purposes of curiosity and out of respect to the past to 
preserve so cumbersome a piece of mechanism by which the 
human species at least for nearly two thousand years con 
sented to guide the operations of the reasoning faculty 

some recent logicians though entertaining fundamentally 
the same views do not go so far though we do not draw 
the inference in reasoning from the general proposition 
where such is employed it is necessary to preserve con 
sistency between the particular conclusion we infer from the 
minor premiss and our former experience expressed by such 
general proposition and the rules of the syllogism serve as 
an indispensable guarantee for that purpose the use of 
the syllogism is consequently nothing else than the use of 
general propositions in reasoning and these are only certain 
formula generalised from the results of our former expe 
rience to determine what inferences may be drawn in any 
particular case the work of drawing the inference is that 
of applying the formula and the rules of the school logic are 
a system of security for the correctness of the application 

this middle ground between the scotch school and the 
peripatetic logicians was raised with a view to defend the 
syllogism from the charge of really assuming the conclusion 
in the premises an accusation that certainly had some

 induction and deduction b iv 

colour of plausibility so long as the syllogism was confounded 
with deduction and made to guarantee the cogency of every 
inference that could be thrust into the four moods of the 
first figure for if we argue from every man being a re 
sponsible agent that the present emperor of eussia is 
accountable for his actions it is evident we assert no new 
truth but merely particularise or draw out of the general 
formula major premiss one of the single instances already 
included under it such a form of reasoning it is conse 
quently contended is incompetent to advance us one step 
in the progress of knowledge or to corroborate any truth 
since it falls into the sophism which renders the conclu 
sion a mere tautological repetition of the premises tet 
taking logic on the high ground of the deductive syllo 
gism with which its adversaries have confounded it there is 
need of little ingenuity to invalidate the charges alleged 
against its method for waving at present the question 
how we come by the majority of general propositions which 
is really the cardinal point in dispute it cannot be denied 
that we frequently obtain such formula without realising 
onetenth of the meaning they are calculated when fully 
analysed to convey and that we can only exhaust them of 
their latent truth by casting about for middle terms either 
by experiment or reflection which link them with other 
classes of phenomena previously unknown to us and thereby 
extend our knowledge for example when newton first 
propounded his general law that material bodies attract eacli 
other with a force proportionate to the product of their 
masses directly and the square of their mutual distance in 
versely he hardly dreamt that the precession of the equi 
noxes could be deduced as a natural consequence of the 
same principle nor did pythagoras when he first realised 
the truth of the necessary relations between the base and 
sides of a rightangled triangle think of the consequent de 
velopment to which they subsequently conducted him in the 
construction of the th proposition at least he is said to 
have comported himself on the discovery of that famous 
theorem as columbus in sight of a new world or as kepler 
when he found that the satellites of jupiter verified his three 
celebrated laws of the elliptical motion of the planets 

to take another branch of cases which are generally 
deemed more akin to the syllogistic scheme viz those con 



c ii objections to nominalist doctrines 

nected with the moral sciences and concern either legisla 
tion theological doctrine or ethics whatever may be said 
as to the rise of general propositions from the agglomeration 
of particular instances in other sciences it is evident they 
are presented to us in these subjects at the outset in a gene 
ral form and that all the subsequent stages of inferences 
which these sciences embrace consist in the application of 
such general formula by means of middle terms to particu 
lar instances never previously contemplated by us all 
these deductions lead to new truths so far as tjuths can be 
called new in the human sense of the term and consequently 
must be looked upon as resulting in a real addition to our 
knowledge what are all the doctrines for instance which 
each denomination of christians have raised upon the teach 
ing of christ but so many inferences deductively inferred 
how far rightly or otherwise is not for us to say from the 
general scheme of doctrine he is reputed to have taught 
to select a single case it would be certainly going very far to 
aver that the colossal system of doctrines that the patristic 
fathers built on a few scattered texts of scriptures were 
assumed in the premises from which they were deductively 
inferred and yet all these tenets were embraced as original 
truths latent indeed in the general propositions from which 
they were drawn but not fully realised by the primitive 
church and that by the whole of christendom in their 
day and are so held by the majority of professing christians 
now 

now in all these cases which extend over all the compart 
ments of knowledge when a particular conclusion is deduced 
from a general proposition it is evident that the truth in 
ferred must be in some measure contained in the premises to 
warrant the illation but it does not follow that it must be 
explicitly involved but only in a virtual and implicit manner 
in which case there can be no direct assumption of the pre 
mises in the conclusion in which the petitio principii consists 
the process of inference in its deductive as well as its induc 
tive processes is perfectly analogous in this respect to the 
counter processes of natural truths which it seeks to evolve 
there is no effect which is not implied in the cause out of 
which it springs nor any state of nature which has not its

principles latently concealed in the state immediately pre 
ceding its existence the phenomena notwithstanding are 
substantially different though secretly involved and inter 
laced in one web of mutual dependence so that one series of 
facts cannot arise until their principles have been furnished 
at least in an inchoate state by another if therefore the 
syllogistic theory is to be set aside on account of its implied 
assumption of conclusion in the premises we must set aside all 
exposition of natural truths and forego reasoning altogether 
we do not then require mr mills theory to defend even 
the deductive syllogism from a petitio principii nor we fear 
can that theory be maintained without giving up the main 
uses of the peripatetic logic for if as that logician some 
what strangely avers the formal portion of inference must 
alone be tested by the experimental canons of inductive in 
quiry while that part which merely refers to the consultation 
of our former experience on the point at issue and keeping our 
inference in harmony with it can only fall under the surveil 
lance of the syllogistic rules the entire use of logic is at an 
end the functions which it has to discharge relate entirely to 
that part of inference which mr mill denies its competency 
to fulfil nor can it throw any light on the interpretation of 
the general formula by which we seek to cover any particular 
conclusion we have inferred the latter supposition is r in 
fact ludicrous and requires a very quixotic imagination to 
combine the two things in the same theory what help can 
mood and figure with the heavy accompaniment of a group 
of rules and canons which exclusively relate to pure in 
ference lend to the interpretation of general propositions 
formed from the results of ones individual experience the 

 baron galluppi in his lezioni di logica answers this futile objec 
tion in another way while he allows the two terms of the conclusion 
are fairly contained in the premises he denies that the illation is con 
tained in which the truth of the conclusion exists the latter he desig 
nates the formal part of the syllogism the former the material the 
inference of course springs from the comparison of the two terms of 
the conclusion with the middle and as the result of that act is only 
expressed in the conclusion the premises can by no means be said 
to contain it the logicians whose opinions we combat in the text 
confound the formal with the material part of the syllogism but 
though we see the latter intuitively it does not follow we see the 
former as we have before observed a middle term is necessary to 
distinguish it see mills logic functions of the syllogism where 
he distinctly propounds the doctrine in the text

syllogism even in its deductive dress which mr mill takes 
to be an essential part of its nature has no more relation to 
such a function than a flail has to the office of a windmill or 
a pistonrod to the uses of a compass the canons of in 
ference were exclusively framed to guarantee the reasoning 
process to deny their competency in their proper sphere 
and apply them to objects in which as mr mill asserts no 
inference is concerned would be a burlesque upon the ordi 
nary notions of adaptability between end and means 

the only things which can be of any service in the inter 
pretation of general propositions are a clear perception 
combined with a capacious memory and dugald stewart 
was consequently more consistent when entertaining the 
same principles with mr mill he rejected the syllogistic 
theory altogether and resolved all reasoning into intuition 
and remembrance 

 general truths exist independent of experience 
even in the supposition that all general propositions are 
the result of experience it would by no means follow that 
the school logic was practically useless since such an hypo 
thesis could not preclude an argument from being incon 
clusive as to form or present us with any means of detecting 
its inconclusiveness different from that of throwing it into the 
syllogistic form and bringing it under the universal canon of 
inference nevertheless the assumption would tend to weaken 
the syllogistic doctrine since it would show that reasoning at 
least in its elementary stage was purely restricted to one pre 
miss there being no common principle to serve as major until 
a number of particular inferences had become agglomerated 
into a general proposition now we fairly put it to each 
ones consciousness whether such an exposition of the 
manner in which he registered his first inferences is correct 
when a child has once felt the consequences of playing with 
fire does it ever trust itself again with the dangerous ele 
ment what need has it of a second experience to certify 
that sugar is sweet and acids bitter do the number of in 
stances in which these objects are felt through the course of 
the longest life add a single iota of strength to the first in 
ference if no one can say that they do without contra 
dicting the general experience of his species then is that first 
inference a general proposition not singly inferred from the 



 induction and deduction b iv 

individual case but from a constituent principle of our intel 
lectual constitution taken in conjunction with it which in 
teriorly assures us that whatever qualities we have found in 
combination with particular phenomena will invariably ac 
company the subsequent repetitions of that phenomena 

if our inferences never travelled beyond the particular 
cases out of which they spring it would not only follow that 
each repetition of the inference would act as an additional 
guarantee for applying it to an indiscriminate number of 
similar cases but that all the relative degrees of certainty as 
well in different minds as in each individuals consciousness 
would arise exclusively from the number of times the par 
ticular coincidence or disagreement about which it was 
employed had been experienced to this indisputable conse 
quence of the assumption of the empirical nature of all 
general propositions each ones experience gives the lie for 
though there are a class of facts that absolutely follow that 
law as those connected with contingent events and re 
sult in general propositions of an empirical character 
there are other classes of truths which do not require 
any sensible experience to assure the mind that they in 
clude every concrete case to which they are capable of being 
applied as abstract propositions the truth of which the 
mind perceives intuitively in its ideas while there is an ad 
ditional class which require one exemplification of the in 
ference but after that are so indubitable and certain in their 
character as to be instinctively generalised on the spot and 
extended to every subsequent instance of the same pheno 
mena the indispensable corollaries of the doctrine that all 
general propositions are only agglutinations of particular in 
ferences do not agree with the facts of which each ones 
own consciousness is a steady witness the principle itself is 
consequently to be rejected as untenable 

mr mill has attempted to confound abstract or necessary 
truths with those of a physical character by resolving them 
into hypothetical notions and making the necessity which 

 sir w hamilton will not admit this principle because it does not 
necessitate but only inclines we should like to know if the worthy 
edinburgh professor ever so far doubted of the burning qualities of fire 
as to put his hand into a flame twice or ever refused to eat bread 
because he mistrusted its nutritive properties with all due respect 
to so high an authority the practical exemplification of the principle 
he lays down would be a mark of insanity 



c ii necessaby and contingent tetjth 

we suppose to accompany them the simple result of habit in 
conformity with the consequence which we have attributed 
to his principle but here again this acute philosopher is 
strangely at strife with himself for if such propositions 
be hypothetical true it is evident they must be held neces 
sarily so as long as the hypothesis is maintained otherwise it 
would be competent to any one to aver that the same thing 
could be and could not be at the same time it is there 
fore absurd to say with such a doctrine in the foreground 
that their necessity springs from habit 

but does the necessity of necessary truths spring from 
their hypothetical character and can the latter mark be 
supposed to exist in combination with them we think 
neither of these cases can be maintained in the first place 
there is a class of necessary truths even conceded by mr 
mill to bear no evidence of hypothesis about them which 
are notwithstanding held by the mind with the same intui 
tive certainty as those which he deems of a suppositive cha 
racter that the two sides of a triangle must be always 
greater than the third that two straight lines cannot enclose 
a space and truths of a similar character do not involve the 
least particle of hypothesis in their statement is universally 
admitted yet they are embraced as soon as enunciated with 
the same confidence as the propositions which refer to the 

 dr whewell very properly distinguishes necessary from contingent 
truth by the utter impossibility of the former being otherwise than it is 
thus to take a numerical instance and are we cannot con 
ceive them by any freak of thought to make phil ind sciences 
i in reply mr mill takes the inconceivability of the re 
verse of a proposition as the only sign of its necessity and attempts to 
prove the futility of such a mark by citing cases of doctrines such as 
the antipodes once deemed inconceivable which have nevertheless 
subsequently taken their place as scientific truths but this is playing 
with the double sense of the word inconceivable in a manner which is 
unworthy of a logician of mr mills attainments the term evidently 
can be and is very frequently applied by dr whewell to denote two 
classes of objects one which cannot be entertained without conflicting 
with the primary laws of the reasoning faculty and the other which 
like some of the truths of revelation surpasses our comprehension 
simply because the truths it embraces belongs to a class of subjects 
which either through defective faculties or want of means of informa 
tion we are unfitted to realise it would be doing injustice to mr 
mill not to suppose that he understood dr whewell to take the term 
in the passage animadverted upon in the former sense logic

equality of the radii of a circle that is supposed to depend 
upon the possibility of abstracting length from breadth for 
its acceptance whence comes the difference if both classes 
of necessary truths are held with the like uniform and un 
varying degree of certainty by the believing mind even if 
we were disposed to save mr mill from the consequences of 
his first inconsistency which his words however will not 
allow us to do and assert that the truth of the purely sup 
positive group springs from their hypothetical character 
while that of the contrary class arises from habit the dis 
tinction could serve no purpose unless to overthrow mr 
mills doctrines for in that case the indisputable conse 
quence would follow that the hypothetical class must be 
granted as soon as the condition was expressed while that 
series whose truth was the mere creature of habit and asso 
ciation would be received with doubt at first and go on in 
creasing in certainty according to the number of times the 
phenomena in which they first took their rise was repeated 
but such a supposition is at war with the plainest truths that 
consciousness reveals to us and could not be entertained with 
out convicting the first principles of reasoning of imposture 
we can only escape from such false consequences by 
ascribing the uniformity of belief with which all abstract 
truth is held to the necessary relation between the classes 
of our ideas out of which they spring a relation which is 
assented to in the same moment as it is intuitively perceived 
and instead of depending on experience does not require one 
confirmation from that source to assure the mind that it in 
cludes all the cases that actual reality can bring under its 
judgment when we say that two straight lines cannot en 
close a space or affirm that the radii of a circle are equal 
there is no more hypothesis in the last proposition than 
in the first since we do not affirm that the things of 
which we speak exist out of our conceptions but that both 
are necessarily true as beheld in the percipient mind 
even viewed with relation to external objects the only con 
dition that is required in either case is the existence of space 
and sensible lines to which they can be referred for it is no 
more necessary that such lines should exist without breadth 
to realise the truth of the last case than that of the first 
since the radii would still be equal if drawn to the very edge

of the circumference of the circle and in that sense would 
fulfil the condition imposed by the geometrical definition of 
a straight line but the fact is owing to defective instru 
ments and the inexactness attending even the most delicate 
manipulations the minds conceptions can never be fault 
lessly cast into physical embodiments but this by no means 
argues a want of reality in the conceptions themselves but 
is to be ascribed to the grossness of our sensible perceptions 
which are not fitted to embody abstract truth to a greater 
degree of perfection than is requisite to attain mans end in 
creation if mathematical or abstract truth fall short of ab 
solute perfection when carried into the material world phy 
sical truth is in the same predicament ail concrete know 
ledge being only so many approximations to absolute reality 
but to call either it or mathematical truth hypothetical on 
that account would bring the whole structure of science 
about our ears 

from the foregoing considerations we conceive ourselves 
fully warranted in drawing a distinction between three classes 
of truths existing in the mind two underlying all our in 
ferences from particular events and the other furnishing 
the occasions by which either class are called into action 
when we restrict our judgment to a particular event the 
result is a simple intuitive truth but when the inference 
travels further than the affirmation of the agreement or dis 
agreement of the terms in that particular case a real illation 
has taken place which upon analysis will be found to 
consist in the combination of one of the first class of truths 
major with the particular case minor which called it into 
being thus when a child has once perceived that moisture 
is the effect of rain it directly concludes that in all future 
cases it cannot come in contact with that element without 
getting soaked from an interior conviction which assures 
it that similar effects follow from like causes and which 
expressly evolved constitutes the major proposition to the

to be of equal breadth the doctrine of hypothesis originated 

with dugald stewart the only distinction between the two classes 
of abstract truth which mr mill strives to discriminate by introducing 
the extraneous idea of hypothesis is that one admits of direct the 
other of indirect proof or reductio ad absurdum

inference in question if such a proposition be not in the 
mind instigating the judgment to leap to the general con 
clusion then we say there is no ground for illation for 
when the child forms a judgment in the absence of any such 
a priori truth it is strictly of a particular character thus 
it never concludes from the single fact that its nurse has 
been angry today that she will be so tomorrow simply 
because it has no general a priori judgment in the mind 
that could form a major premiss in combination with the in 
dividual case to warrant the supposition 

nor is it even necessary to concede though it does happen 
in many cases that individual occurrences are required to 
call the abstract truth into being with respect to every par 
ticular phenomenon before a child has experienced a prac

to the same thing are equal to each other a truism as long 
familiar to his memory as his own identity such prin 
ciples as these accompany the first exercise of thought 
fashion the first judgments that the mind forms and instead 
of being dependent on particular inferences comprise the 
very elements out of which such inferences are evolved and 
present the only means of testing or legitimating their 
validity had the divine economy ordered this otherwise 
and left the child entirely dependent for its knowledge upon 
its own solitary experience it would be the victim of de 
struction before leaving its nurses arms and such a thing 
as certainty could no more enter into the mind than the 
idea of colour into the conception of a blind man 

such a priori judgments which we agree with kant 
in accepting as the ultimate elements of our intellectual 
constitution may be distinguished into two classes viz 
those which have direct reference to external facts and are 
only true in the supposition that the laws of nature remain 
and will continue immutable such however may be denied 
as we shall subsequently see in certain cases without im

 various grades of certainty 

the elements into which we have resolved the syllogistic 
process partly correspond to the three divisions of aris 
totle touching the modality of propositions or the different 
degrees of belief with which a judgment is held by the mind 
which the stagyrite classes under the head of necessary cer 
tain and contingent probable the first term he refers to 
that class which spring out of the necessary relation between 
our ideas and which are so absolutely true that they cannot 
be denied without invalidating the reasoning principle itself 
in the scholastic sense this class was usually styled meta 
physical and even god is declared incompetent to render 
them otherwise than they are the things which they desig 
nate remaining the same as the supposition would lead to 
the confounding the intrinsic properties of things physical 
truth on the other hand while capable of demonstrative 
certainty is altogether dependent on the continuance of 
the laws of the external world and consequently may be 
abrogated when the author of them chooses to suspend their 
functions physical truth therefore is confined to the 
boundaries of the material world to space and time and is 
dependent on the will of the creator while metaphysical 
truth exists absolutely and universally and can in no in 
stance be supervened without the destruction of the concep 
tions which enter into its composition the supposition that 
fresnels law of the bifurcation of light in certain crystals 
was suspended would by no means involve the destruction 
of either the crystallised bodies concerned or an illuminat

ing medium but we could not for a moment conceive lying 
to be a virtue or a cylinder to be a sphere without annihi 
lating all the conceptions which enter into the respective 
terms of the judgment 

contingent or probable truth comprises that wide class of 
judgments which depend upon events whose operations we 
are unable to investigate and concerning which we cannot 
predict anything but with a very doubtful degree of certainty 
that the weather will be fine tomorrow because it has been 
so today is ajudgment that falls under this category because 
we can furnish no other grounds for it than mere conjecture 
this class of propositions is generally designated by the word 
chance accident c and was frequently so deemed by aris 
totle and the ancients but there is no such thing as chance 
or accident existing in nature everything being controlled by 
systematic laws and produced by the action of regular 
causes the only difference being that in the class of things 
termed contingent we are unable to penetrate into their 
operation the result of the derby for example next year 
depends upon the superior qualifications of a certain horse 
the manner of treatment in the interim and the honesty 
with which his owner and rider make use of his speed in 
the contest but the issue at best can only be conjectured 
with probable certainty because we cannot foresee the re 
sult of these causes or ascertain how far they will operate 

to this list the scholastics added that of moral truth 
which though when accompanied with strict marks of vali 
dity falls somewhat short of demonstrative certainty still ap 
proaches so nigh it that it may almost be ranked in the same 
category such are the foundations upon which rest our 
belief in the testimony of others with regard to facts which 
we have not seen and which impel us to believe histo 
rical truth when accurately verified with the same tenacity 
as we accept any scientific fact derived from our own inves 
tigation for that a number of men having no connexion 
with each other and influenced by no personal motives 
should conspire to cheat mankind with a lie is a supposition 
which we can no more entertain than any notion which im 
peaches the reasoning principle itself yet in all such pro 
positions there is room for cavil as many find it difficult to 
convince themselves that all the required conditions have been

fulfilled and when the testimony of individuals are incon 
sistent with the permanence and fixity of natures laws 
some philosophers choose to abide by the latter as more cer 
tain than the human testimony no matter how well sup 
ported which seeks to set them aside 

 twofold doctrine of modality 

the question of the different degrees of belief by which 
judgments are held has been deemed of so unsatisfactory a 
character by many modern logicians as to be excluded from 
the domain of the science on the ground that the certainty 
affects the predicate of a proposition and not the copula and 
as such does not come within the reasoning process there 
is no doubt a quasi species of modality which only concerns 
the predicate as when we say the wine is uncommonly good 
 the sun is very hot but this does not come within the 
proper definition of the term and consequently must not be 
confounded with it with regard to strict modality the 
copula as the link of connexion between the two extremes 
of a proposition is undoubtedly modified by any variation of 
the certainty which exist between their union if two 
weights are held together by a chain any diminution or in 
crease of the firmness with which they are held together 
must influence the chain uniting and not the weights which 
it holds the consideration of modality therefore becomes 
essential to any practical system of reasoning for the con 
clusion can in no instance involve any further degrees of cer 
tainty than is contained in the premises and if we would have 
the mind realise its full value it is essential to know the 
amount of certainty that accompanies each premiss in the 
syllogism moreover since the resolution of a point in dis 
pute will often depend upon the relative value we attach to 
different degrees of evidence it becomes a matter of very 
great importance to consider how far and in what respect 
one class of judgments is more certain than another 

the complete doctrine of modality would consequently 
embrace every degree of belief which the mind is accustomed 
to attach to the different classes of its judgments with the 
corresponding motives commencing with the lowest grade of 

 such as of miracles 



 different degeees of evidence b tv 

probability and rising through the intervening shades of 
belief to the highest metaphysical certainty each of the 
divisions in that case already given would admit of a minute 
subdivision thus for instance the class of moral truths 
might be arranged under four or five distinct heads first 
under that of historical testimony which even in itself has 
different branches of certainty that which relates to the de 
struction of nineveh not being commonly received with the 
same credence as we believe the burning of moscow or occur 
rences of a more recent date in this respect time seems 
to be in some respects the arbiter of the degree of belief 
we may attach to a fact depending on the testimony of tra 
dition the fate of troy has long been considered of very 
doubtful authenticity and the early account of eome is be 
ginning to loom through the twilight of fable which may if 
the world last long enough in the lapse of ages overspread 
its entire history secondly under that class of evidence 
which relates to the existence of the soul in a future state 
the belief of an overruling providence and the impression 
that man in the next life will be punished or rewarded for his 
actions in this all which judgments being incapable of de 
monstration or any very rigid proof are accepted by a cer 
tain class of minds with great distrust and even in the judg 
ment of those really confiding in them who form the vast 
majority of the human species rest upon other foundations 
than the purely moral proofs which are alleged in their sup 
port thirdly under that class of testimony which relates 
to present facts whose reality any one if he chooses may 
go and convince himself of by the evidence of his senses 
this class of truths is the most certain of any others de 
pending on purely moral grounds and men universally accept 
them with the same amount of credence as they receive the 
plainest revelations of their own consciousness fourthly 
under that of ethical doctrine for though the majority of 
mankind are disposed to call things by their right names 
and would really stone a man who ventured to preach up a 
loose morality among them there are not wanting many 
philosophers of very acute penetration who affirm that intrin 
sically there is no more vice in adultery than in saying ones 
prayers and that the vulgar distinctions of virtue and wicked 
ness only spring from the conventional notions of society 
that such opinions if practically acted upon would destroy 



c hi ceiteeia of evidence 

the ligaments by which nations and communities exist is 
universally admitted and since man was born for society it 
becomes a matter not of very hard calculation to determine 
how far it may be presumed that either god or nature 
would make the condition of one of the great ends of his 
destiny dependent on a delusion 

 the same subject continued criteria of evidence 
the doctrine of sufficient reason 

the branches of physical truth may be divided into ex 
perimental and demonstrative both are received with suffi 
cient certainty to displace doubt but assurance is doubly 
fortified and strengthened when physical truth has stood all 
the tests of the demonstrative methods for we then receive 
two different species of security for the existence of the fact 
or law whose validity may have been in question which is 
tantamount to a confirmation from two distinct sources of 
evidence the metaphysical portion of the general division 
may be considered under the heads of mathematical and 
logical the first member is sufficiently evident having been 
already dilated upon to some extent the nature of the 
latter will fully appear in considering the different criteria 
which have been laid down by logicians for sustaining the 
mutual dependence and harmony of the different branches 
of evidence both with themselves and with each other 

the first of these is the principle of contradiction viz 
 that the same property cannot be at the same time affirmed 
and denied of the same subject thus we could not main 
tain the existence of keplers laws while we believed in the 
ptolemaic theory of the heavens for that would be plainly 
tantamount to saying that the planets moved in complete 
circles at the same time that they described an elliptic 
course through the heavens yet trite as even this principle 
may appear it is more frequently violated in moral judg 
ments than we imagine for how often do we meet with 
men who talk about the existence of a free press in con 
nexion with absolute monarchy and who cast their lot with 
despotism while they affirm that all their opinions and predi 
lections are in favour of absolute liberty indeed there are 
a class of persons in whom this error is so deeply rooted 
that their statements only cease to be contradictory when 
they become tautological 



 diffebent degbees of evidence b iv 

the second criterion is the complement of the former viz 
that conceptions which agree with each other can be in 
thought united or affirmed of the same subject at the same 
time and is designated the principle of identity the third 
is the principle of the excluded middle lex exclusi niedii 
 either a given judgment must be true of any subject or 
its contradictory there is no middle course the result of 
this criterion is that we cannot accept one proposition as 
true without abandoning its contradictory as false and vice 
versa if therefore we can prove that the contradictory of 
any judgment is true we impugn its veracity quite as much 
as if we directly overthrew it the principle of sufficient 
reason may be said to form the fourth criterion of evidence 
viz that every judgment must rest upon a sufficient ground 
or reason which excludes from the consideration of evidence 
every belief rooted in ignorance prejudice or selfinterest 
from this law it would follow first that we cannot grant the 
reason without accepting what follows from it which is the 
foundation of syllogistic inference secondly that if all the 
consequences are held to be true the reason must be true 
thirdly that we cannot reject the consequence without re 
jecting the reason hence the mode of proof called reductio 
per impossibile 

logical truth however does not communicate to the 
mind a distinct degree of certainty from that of mathe 
matical both are accepted with the highest degree of belief 
that can be supposed to exist and are therefore properly 
termed metaphysical physical and moral truths when con 
firmed by the strict marks which we shall presently offer as 
a test of their validity are accepted with a similar degree of 
belief though it is hard to conceive this of so certain a cha

it does not follow that there is a cause for everything the latter is a

racter as that which accompanies metaphysical judgments 
inasmuch as the hypothesis of their being false does not lace

with great strength of argument by a group of very able phi 
losophers but moral testimony which does not bear the 
assigned marks of validity or physical events which seem to 
contradict the usual order of nature or refer to future 
results into the causes of which we are unable to penetrate 
must be regarded as probable but the precise amount of 
credence with which they must be accepted will form the 
chapter of a subsequent book 



chapter iv 

the foundations of evidence 

 number of primitive elements into which all knowledge 
can le resolved their relation to each other 

the motives which impel us to form those various judg 
ments we have just considered are stated differently by 
logicians according to the opinions they have formed on 
the nature of knowledge the widest division we have seen 
is that of galluppi who resolves these motives into seven 
distinct elements viz consciousness memory external 
sense analogy reasoning evidence intuitive we suppose 
he means and authority since it is impossible to demon 
strate the veracity of any one of these means of know 
ledge without falling into a petitio principii thus when 
descartes denied the infallibility of any other primitive 
fountain of knowledge unless that solitary act of conscious 
ness which informed him of his own existence and attempted 

 for analogy galluppi in conjunction with some other logicians 
uses the word induction may we be allowed to enter our protest 
against this abuse in applying terms whose functions are already 
sufficiently large to designate an entirely distinct class of subjects with 
which they have no connexion if this habit proceed much further 
all distinctions of philosophical nomenclature will become confounded 
and we shall be in the condition of geographers who owing to the cus 
tom of calling all the places in the new world after the titles of the old 
cannot tell when an occurrence is said to have happened at windsor 
or halifax whether it took place in europe australia or america 



 foundations of evidence b iv 

to demonstrate the veracity of the rest he assumed the 
infallibility of reasoning and memory as no truth can be 
proved without the exercise of these two motives of judg 
ments and when the scholastics who were addicted to the 
folly of demonstrating everything attempted to prove the 
veracity of memory by the veracity of grod they fell into as 
palpable a sophism inasmuch s the accuracy of tlie trains of 
inference they employed depended on the infallibility of the 
very faculty they were intended to establish 

these motives however are so related that while many of 
them can be exercised apart from the rest each requires a 
separate act of consciousness for the perception of its ex 
istence thus we believe in the existence of the external 
world on the immediate authority of the senses but these 
are entirely dependent for their action on the act of con 
sciousness so that the existence of matter is certified to us 
mediately through the act of consciousness again no act 
of memory can be exercised unless through the same 
medium and when that faculty assures us of our own 
identity consciousness is required as a means by which that 
act of memory may become manifest to us but though 
consciousness thus underlies every other primitive truth 
and is essential to their exercise it has functions apart from 
them and therefore may be said to have a distinct existence 
thus it reveals to us immediately and that without the aid 
of any of the other faculties the idea of our existence with 
that class of intuitive judgments which spring out of the 
relation between our ideas it consequently may be said to 
enjoy a prerogative over the other motives of judgments as 
it not only is the direct means of communicating to us a 
wide class of evidence but is the grand basement on which 
the certainty of the other motives rest the supposition of 
their invalidity involving in the impeachment of its veracity 
the destruction of all knowledge 

 keid and royard collard following the commonsense doctrine in 
stituted by pere buffier erected consciousness into a distinct faculty 
even existing separately from perception but for this they are pro 
perly censured by sir w hamilton the scholastic definition of 
consciousness or sensus iutimus is perceptio qua mens de presenti suo 
statu admonetur and as such it is usually taken as synonymous with 
conscientia the contrary opinion is maintained by sir w 

hamilton 



c it memory unimpeachable 

it may be observed that each of these means of evidence 
affords an inlet for original information except memory and 
that its function is simply to reproduce the past states or 
modifications of the thinking mind it is not therefore an 
original but an auxiliary motive of judgment but one of so 
important a character that it ranks next to consciousness 
in the function of generating knowledge since in the ab 
sence of its veracity as we shall presently show none of the 
other motives could be of the slightest avail in constructing 
a system of science in examining into the nature of the 
other motives each will be found to have distinct oflices en 
tirely independent of one another unless indeed evidence 
which according to our description of consciousness can 
have no place in the category even in the narrow sense of 
intuition in which alone its claims could be considered 
for the judgments which intuitive evidence embraces are 
either of a metaphysical character or they refer to particular 
coincidences in the external world in the former case they 
come immediately under the cognisance of consciousness 
and in the latter that of the external senses its presence 
consequently in the list leads to a cross division besides 
being entirely unnecessary but as of the six remaining 
principles consciousness never becomes the subject of the 
direct assaults of scepticism unless through the medium of 
the others we need only inquire in what respect the veracity 
of these may be placed out of the reach of its attacks 

 memory an ultimate source of evidence 
without the faculty of remembering the past modifications 
of our minds every moment of life would be the first moment 
for us we could not recal one experience or register one 
single judgment or inference no science consequently could 
exist the only conclusion we could arrive at would be 
i am and nothing more any attempt therefore to im 
pugn the veracity of this faculty lays the axe to the root 
of all knowledge and even aims at the destruction of 
personal identity sceptics have not neglected to avail 
themselves of the compendious method thus offered for the 
destruction of certainty and have directed their attack in 
two ways 
 first it is contended that memory is faltering and uncer

tain and in many cases has been convicted of deception 
who has not mistaken one object for another or been fully 
assured he was in possession of a fact which when he came 
to search for it either eluded his recollection or emerged out 
of his consciousness in another form our courts of justice 
and the system of arbitration to which mankind find it neces 
sary to have recourse hourly present cases of men each at 
the instigation of this faculty making the most conflicting 
statements and staking their veracity on the asseveration of 
an oath the answer to this objection is patent we only 
vindicate the certainty of memory in all those obvious cases 
in which its certainty cannot deceive us without arguing some 
degree of mental derangement in the understanding of the 
person who manifests it for certainty of memory in such 
cases is all that is required to legitimate the generation 
of knowledge so far as its operation is concerned but ii 
men choose to tax their memory with burdens beyond its 
strength or if they fail to remember things which persons 
who possess this faculty in any ordinary degree would easily 
recollect memory is not on that account to be declared inca 
pable of performing its ordinary functions otherwise we 
might argue that because man could not bear a camels load 
he was not able to sustain his body erect or from the fact 
that there were always a number of valetudinarians that the 
human organs were incapable of the performance of their 
healthy functions 

another attempt has been made to weaken the evidence 
of memory by depriving that faculty of the collateral secu 
rity which it derives from its connexion with consciousness 
for it is contended that consciousness never takes into ac 
count the objects of memory but only of an act existing 
within us called by that name but this is a distinction 
without a difference for memory is nothing else than the 
perception of the past modifications of our being render 
these illusory or wipe out their existence from the act of 
consciousness and no act of memory can exist again if 
the testimony of consciousness be veracious we must admit 
all that it reveals but it certifies to us the existence of 
three distinct faculties viz that of the perception of things 
actually existing of those which have been and are not of 
those which are not and have never been now if the 
objects of memory had no existence it would be confounded 



 iv memoey atd pebsohal identity 

with the last faculty that of simple imagination or in other 
words it would not exist in the manner in which conscious 
ness reveals its existence to us we cannot consequently 
admit the separation of the objects of memory from con 
sciousness without impeaching that faculty itself of error 

one of the principal functions of memory undoubtedly is 
to assure the consciousness of its individual identity but as 
it fails to do this beyond a certain period of existence it has 
been pronounced unequal to its mission and accused of 
leaving one of the most essential truths without any tangible 
foundation for what certainty have we against our exist 
ence from eternity in a state of metempsychosis or that we 
have not been in the world for three thousand years and 
even inhabited the body of a crocodile or a sparrow all 
that memory certifies is our existence down to a certain 
period of time but with regard to the state in which we 
existed anterior to that period as the assumed first months 
of our infancy and the nine months probation in the womb 
it says confessedly nothing it is consequently charged 
with leaving our personal identity uncertain and as a reflex 
consequence of this defect with rendering all knowledge 
which is built upon the assumption of this truth including 
its own posterior acts of an apocryphal character 

but this difficulty seems to arise from confounding the 
functions of a faculty with the remembrance of the exercise 
of those functions it does not at all follow that because 
memory ceases to recal the manner in which it assured con 
sciousness of the identity of me in the first moments of 
existence that it did not discharge that office it is a neces 
sary condition of our being that as we progress in years the 
remembrance of infancy become less and less distinct until 
we lose sight of its earliest stages altogether but if we con 
cluded from the inability to recollect the acts of memory by 
which our personal identity was revealed to us at the earliest 
stages of existence that no such acts took place we might 
also for a similar reason affirm the same result of those 
periods of adolescence whose manner of existence have 
likewise lapsed out of remembrance for in the same man 
ner as we feel assured that consciousness has always ac 
companied our being from the first dawn of life though 
we may not recollect the distinct acts in which it mani 
fested our existence to us do we believe that memory 



 foundations of evidence b it 

from the earliest stage of being carried forward the experi 
ence of one moment to the next and thus kept alive the 
assurance that the percipient soul constituted one identical 
person now so long as this identity of me has been 
always revealed by memory to our consciousness whether 
we remember the distinct acts or not the link of identity 
has always been preserved and the assurance we feel that 
this condition has been invariably fulfilled could only be 
contravened by recalling a moment of existence in which 
some knowledge of the past was inaccessible to the mind an 
act of course which is beyond human power we then are 
fully authorised to conclude that memory has steadily im 
pressed the existence of me upon the intimate sense and 
that from two principles first that memory itself certifies 
the fact down to a certain stage of childhood and secondly 
that the amount of sensible experience which she then 
assures us we possessed could spring from no other source 
than the constant act of memory keeping the identity of 
one constantly before the mind in transferring the experience 
of one hour to the next 

the denial of transmigration or even the maintenance of 
personal identity is not dependent on the argument we have 
adduced which as far as we know is perfectly novel but 
the aid of analogy is called in to assure the individual that 
what he perceives to be the general law of the human species 
has not been departed from in his case and though memory 
does not expressly guarantee his existence beyond a certain 
period or place the possibility of his eternal duration out of 
court that the immutability of natures laws comes to the aid 
of memory and proves that his existence could not have 
passed the limit of a certain time and that in the interval 
the identical nature of me has been preserved 

 with regard to personal identity it is necessary to distinguish 
three things which locke confounds viz memory consciousness and 
the object of memory memory is the object of consciousness the 
substantial and personal identity of me the object of memory the 
veracity of both is bound up with the reality of their objects per 
sonal identity consists in being able to affirm of one past and present 
existence yet locke makes it consist in the exercise of conscious 
ness whose only function is to declare the present see hum under

c iv objections of sextus empieicus 



 external sense an ultimate source of evidence 

the belief in the existence of matter and its various confor 
mations in the outward world is derived immediately from the 
authority of the senses but mediately is bound up with that 
of consciousness as sensation cannot exist without render 
ing us cognisant of the presence of the object felt thus 
when we affirm the existence of the desk on which we write 
the sense of sight and touch into which indeed vision and 
all the other senses may be resolved vouch for the presence 
of the object in question but the operation of both of these 
senses are accompanied by consciousness which guarantees 
their reality and assures us we are not speaking about a 
mere image or vision but of a substantial embodiment 
the authority of the external senses as a legitimate motive 
of judgment may be consequently invalidated by convicting 
them directly of deception or by separating either the sen 
sations themselves or the objects about which they are 
exercised from the domain of consciousness it was the fate 
of the ancient sceptics to follow the first course their 
modern representatives have made quite as potent an attack 
on human certainty by adhering to the second 

the reasons which impugn the authority of the external 
senses as a certain means of knowledge have received their 
most elaborate exposition at the hands of sextus empiricus 
and may thus be summarily expressed with regard to 

 sextus surnamed empiricus from the school of physicists to 
which he belonged flourished at the end of the second century he 
put the finishing stroke to scepticism by investing it with the form and 
method of a science in his three books entitled hvppaiian vnorvtrat

of comparing the appearances of the senses and thoughts

opposite sensations in men and animals that atmosphere 

everything was uncertain no one thing was to be preferred to another 
his system received a further development in his ten books against 
the mathematicians yrpos tovs adankovs in the last five of which 
he sets in a strong light the uncertainty of the principles of those dog 
matists who maintain that absolute truth is accessible to man by 
affirming it of their doctrines and denies certainty even to the sim 
plest axioms of geometry and arithmetic his writings form a com 
plete storehouse of sceptical reasons and have been pressed into active 
service by modern sceptics and by none more zealously than mon 
taigne at the commencement of his first treatise b i c he 
divides philosophers into three classes viz dogmatists who maintain 
they have found truth academics who affirm that it is impossible to 
discover it sceptics who affirm neither he repeats the latter distinc 
tion in his seventh book against the mathematicians but in 
one respect it does not hold since cenesidemus the reviver of the 
third academy taught substantially the same sceptical doctrines as 
himself the distinction indeed had its origin with cicero acad 
qusest i who discriminated the opinions of pyrrho from those 
of arcesilaus and carneades the founders in his time of the second 
academy for pyrrho maintained that the existence of probability 
and doubt itself was doubtful while these philosophers held that though 
everything was uncertain still there was such a thing as probable 
knowledge into which it was wise to inquire they divided probable 
judgments into three distinct classes triqavr fravtasia dtreprjiatraa

evang xiv sqq the doctrine of doubt or absolute suspension of 
judgment which the followers of the third academy maintained did not 
however originate with pyrrho but with the sophist protagoras who 
flourished about the ninetysecond olympiad or years before christ 
which places him nearly a century in advance of his more famous disciple 
of course there is nothing in the mere name of academician to denote a 
distinct species of opinions as obtains in that of dogmatists and sceptics 
since the word as is well known originated with the name of the owner 
of the gardens near the gates of athens who bequeathed his beautiful 
property to plato as a convenient spot for the delivery of his philoso 
phical lectures the distinction therefore cannot be introduced into 
philosophy without a cross division for the founders of the first 
academy were undoubted dogmatists though they taught opinion 
which legitimately developed their own thesis and led to the destruc 
tion of the universal doubt which followed while the revivers of the 
last academy were complete sceptics the correct division of ancient 
philosophical opinions would be that of dogmatism probabilism and 
scepticism of the latter it is singular to observe the exact resemblance

system at present so widely prevalent in germany

not convey to us any certain information respecting the 
objects whose existence they seem to testify and the as 
sumption of their competency to that end on which all 
physical science is reared is a delusion 

but this objection can only be urged with consistency 
against those who maintain that the absolute nature of sensi 
ble objects is attainable by man a vulgar error adopted by 
the first philosophers of greece but it does not invalidate one 
tittle of our belief in the certainty of experience which con 
stitutes the basis of physical science since it leaves its three 
fundamental corner stones untouched st that our sensa 
tions are real modifications of our beings ndly that they 
instruct us as to the existence of external objects rdly that 
these objects have some relations with us or in other words 
that they appear such as they appear and excite in us sensa 
tions corresponding to the functions we fulfil with regard to 
the healthy preservation of our being istow physical science 
demands the concession of no further principle than is in 
volved in these truths to show apodictically the relation 
which must exist between the objects which produce these 
different sensations as they are conceived by our conscious 
ness with regard to the absolute nature of the objects 
themselves whether they reveal to us the actual essence of 
things as viewed by superior intelligences or excite impres 
sions merely relative to the important ends which man has 
been destined to fulfil in creation science in reality pro 
nounces nothing 

the observation appears to have escaped this school of 
philosophers that men notwithstanding the different varieties 
of sensations generally contrive to perceive the same rela 
tions between their sensations thus whatever may be the 
nature of crystal and light all perceive the same relation 
between crystallised bodies and the illuminating medium 
this uniformity of judgment about the relation of sensible 
objects is amply sufficient to guarantee the inference of the 



 foundations of evidence b it 

laws which spring from this source and connecting their 
phenomena with rational truth to erect the superstructure 
of physical science 

again if the argument of the sceptics be worth anything 
it places beyond doubt the existence of two facts viz that 
there are as many different ways of perceiving nature as there 
are different species of beings and organisations and more 
over that these have as many distinct ways of acting as there 
are different states of the subject on which they act in 
stead therefore of proving there is nothing certain it really 
establishes an important truth in attempting to convict 
its opponents principles of imposture it destroys itself so 
true is the saying of pascal that there is a force of truth 
invincible to every scepticism an independence of demon 
stration invincible to every dogmatism 

the sceptics say we are ignorant of things absolutely and 
can only pretend to an acquaintance with their relative 
nature but it is absurd to affirm that we know things re 
latively without being cognisant of the terms of the rela 
tions the very idea of a body existing in a certain mode 
postulates the existence of four things viz existence ex 
istence of a thing distinct from me the existence in me of 
certain sensations produced by a thing distinct from me and 
that this thing is the cause and is able to be the cause of 
these sensations so far therefore from destroying cer 
tainty by such an argument the sceptics really establish the 
theory they intend to overthrow they find themselves in 
the position of a class of animals whose instinct leads them 
to seek the destruction of certain insects by performing the 
very act which is essential to their preservation 

the objections which a modern school of philosophers have 
urged against the testimony of sense with respect to the 
existence of an external world have taken their rise in some 
theories of perception which it will be necessary to explain 
and confute before we can place their nature in a true light 
or be well satisfied we have escaped from the hard necessity 
of affirming that space and all the worlds which it contains 
together with this great globe itself its cloudcapped 
towers and gorgeous palaces are but the splendid fabric of 
a vision of no substantial reality and merely existing in 
the mind as subjective states arising out of the preesta

wished mechanism of its own nature it has from time 
almost immemorial been a belief that the human mind being 
a spiritual substance was not cognisant of external objects 
directly but through the medium of certain spectra species 
which by an action analogous to luminous bodies conveyed 
the exact impress of the material substances which cast them 
off through the external senses into the mind from this 
opinion no moderns presumed to dissent until a very recent 
period and even descartes in citing every opinion of an 
tiquity before the bar of reason to show cause why it should 
not be consigned to the category of doubt allowed this opinion 
to maintain its place with one important modification that 
 idea should be assumed in place of spectra as the inter 
mediate agent by which external objects were impressed upon 
the mind it was contended however that the presence 
of such ideas in the mind could not be assumed as certain 
evidence of the real existence of the external objects to which 
they refer as they only arose out of certain modifications of the 
percipient being and consciousness did not warrant us to 
conclude the existence of anything beyond them a chasm 
was thus interposed between the existence of the internal 
states of our consciousness and the material world which 
philosophers attempted to bridge over by calling to their as 
sistance the veracity of god or by ingenious theories either 
about seeing all things in the divine nature or concerning a 
preestablished harmony between our internal states and the 
objective world to which they refer each however acting 
independent of the other and solely dependent for their 
mutual correspondence on the divine will such opinions 
of course together with the hypothesis of perception from 
which they flowed reduced the naked testimony of the 
external senses at best to a probable character and opened 

 in this part of the world reid has the credit of being the first 
philosopher to call the principle into question but he got the proof of 
its invalidity at least as he represented it from pere buffier and 
pere buffier obtained it from arnauld see the treatise of the latter

a breach for the sceptic to renew his attack upon the do 
main of certainty in a quarter that sextus empiricus little 
dreamt of trying the strength of and with far better vantage 
ground than that from which he had commenced his attack 
what sextus and genesidemus did for the probabilities of 
carneades hume and condillac effected for the probabilities 
of descartes and locke they showed that in consistency 
with their own principles no such thing as matter could 
exist and that with their postulates in the background even 
the reality of the appearances themselves might be validly 
called in question but that the principle itself is a true 
theory of perception we have no other proof than the very 
slender one of the consentaneous belief of nearly all philo 
sophers up to a very recent date in its veracity of itself it 
is supported by no intrinsic grounds whatever for even ad 
mitting its truth it does not lessen the difficulties it was 
called in to resolve since it is quite as hard to understand 
how external objects can generate spiritual ideas as it is to 
conceive their direct action on a thinking substance if 
matter be declared incapable of the latter it is doubly so 
of the former and berkeley hume and condillac were per 
fectly justified with such a theory in their heads in wiping 
out the external world altogether 

moreover this hypothesis has been introduced not only 
without an object but in total defiance of the revelations of 
consciousness if that principle can be said to assure us of 
anything it certainly is the existence of things external to us 
by the sensations they excite in the mind and all men even 
including those who pretend to disbelieve it act as if the 
testimony was of an infallible character the assumption of 
the contrary doctrine is so contrary to the common sense of 
mankind that it requires some advance in philosophy to en 
tertain it it involves the supposition that perception can 
exist without the reality of the object perceived which seems 
a contradiction in terms the opposition of this theory to 
the plainest instincts of consciousness may be further seen 
from the fact that it is at strife with the idea that we have 

 as descartes wolf malebranche and even locke who adopted 
descartess views on the subject maintained see hum under b iv 
 evxoyiorta 



c it modebn sceptics answebed 

of sensation as a phenomenon whose cause is identical with 
the object which produces it now sensation offers itself to 
the consciousness as distinct from the object felt and the sub 
ject which feels being essentially connected with both it 
manifests itself as an effect of the same object felt not being 
able to refute the testimony of consciousness we cannot 
deny the objectivity of the sensation and consequently the 
existence of the body again if we have a conception of a 
body that is not present to our senses that conception must 
refer to this object solely as an object conceived but not as 
the cause of the conception the absence of this double re 
lation of a conception to the same object converts the act 
into one of pure imagination we consequently cannot 
deny the presence of a body actually modifying our spirit in 
a case of sensible perception without confounding that act 
with the operation of the imaginative faculty and thus again 
convicting consciousness of imposture in blending two acts 
which it assures us are perfectly distinct 

it is urged however that dreams manifest cases analogous 
to those of sensible objects even when no external agents exist 
answering to the images excited in our mind but in the first 
place it may be replied that such impressions exist as simple 
objects of the imagination which are put to flight as soon as 
consciousness awakes us to the real appearance of things 
we do not embrace them with anything like the same de 
gree of certainty as the objects of the waking senses nor 
move our bodily organs to correspond with the illusions they 
excite in us in the same manner as we dispose our actions to 
suit the direct impressions of the sensible world in such 
states we are incapable of reflex acts of thought that is we 
are never able to distinguish between appearances and reali 
ties and the first moment in which we feel inclined to ques 
tion the reality of the impressions in the sensorium we are 
roused into a waking state and feel assured of the delusion 
that dreams owe their origin to the imaginative faculty must 
be admitted from the circumstance that the images which they 
excite in us do not occur in the same order in which they exist 
in nature but arise capriciously out of past modifications of 
the mind which the fancy sets together in the most illsorted 
and fantastic manner in sport as it were witli the solemn 
realities and conventionalisms of nature and society that we 
appear to accord to her pranks any semblance of belief arises 



 foundations of evidence b iv 

from the attention of consciousness being entirely withdrawn 
from the real world and fixed upon such representations of it 
that imagination chooses to give to the entire abstraction of 
everything else but that consciousness accords entire belief to 
such representations on that account is no more to be inferred 
than that of a readers assent to the truth of a tale which 
entirely absorbs his attention or that of a womans belief in 
the real characters of the mythic personages of a theatre be 
cause she swooned away at the finale of the play the only 
difference in these cases is the minor degree in which con 
sciousness is abstracted from surrounding objects which con 
sequently leaves less play for the exercise of pure imagina 
tion a modification which is also displayed in dreams them 
selves since some appear less real than others while there 
are others which accompany a half waking state whose illu 
sion is manifest from the commencement of the operation 

again the sensations excited by dreams never convey a 
new class of objects into the mind but simply reproduce 
the old and that according to the strength of the impression 
by which those objects have been previously communicated 
to the mind or the number of times it has experienced their 
presence hence hounds in their sleep open for their 
prey but no other class of the canine species do because 
they have never hunted in their waking state an orator 
who has controlled the decisions of senates or a general who 
has commanded armies imagine they hear in their sleep the 
murmur of applause or the thunder of cannon but a plough 
man or a huckster never finds himself in the same predica 
ment simply because he has never mounted either a breach 
or a tribune this principle is undeniable being attested 
by every ones experience if therefore nothing enters the 
mind in dreams but what has been there in some shape or 
other in its waking state these delusions instead of weaken 
ing our belief in the existence of external bodies really esta 
blish it or in other words they show the impression of the 
existence to have been so strong as to act when the object 
which originally produced it has passed away 

all the errors which have been propagated on the testimony 
of external sense have sprung out of the supposition that the 
veracity of consciousness can stand without the veracity of 
the other media of knowledge but we have shown at least as 
far as two are concerned that it assures us of their particular 



 iv extebnal sense united with consciousness 

existence both as to the relation of the exercise of the act and 
the object and therefore cannot be isolated from them this 
truth is further strengthened by the illogical consequences 
in which its contradictory has landed its opponents for 
while pere buffier with eeid formed the veracity of external 
sense on the common sense of mankind as distinct from con 
sciousness they fell into a palpable petitio principii since 
they had previously assumed the universality of the belief as 
a mark of such testimony being a primitive truth or in other 
words they first lay down the postulate that every truth which 
is universally received is primitive and must be received 
on its own evidence and then show the testimony of the 
external senses is such by affirming of it the very character 
istic which they ought to have proved though the car 
tesians avoided this paralogism by resting the veracity of the 
senses on the veracity of god whose existence they placed 
in the idea we have of the infinite still they were guilty of 
the inconsistency of affirming that consciousness was com 
petent to certify the presence of that idea while it was unable 
to assure us of the existence of finite bodies out of which 
such idea may be said to spring if however consciousness 
may be said to warrant us in assuming anything it is that 
external things are not only the cause of our sensations but 
the objects we perceive along with our sensation or in other 
words that our sensations are not only passive modifications 
but the immediate perceptions of things outside of us and 
we cannot invalidate such testimony without impugning its 
veracity and even calling into doubt our own existence

acquainted with particular facts but physical science can 

 pere buffier gives two other marks of primitive truth besides the 
one in the text viz the incapability they manifest of being esta 
blished by truths clearer than themselves nd that those who cavil 
with them act upon the belief of their existence see pessai sur les 
verits primitives c the gross instance of the fallacy in the 
text reminds us of the common reply of the farmer when we ask him

not draw any certain inference from them without a belief 
in certain axioms such as the stability of the course of 
nature that individuals similar in their apparent qualities are 
similar in their occult qualities that similar effects proceed 
from similar causes and other principles of the same import 
which as they spring from an interior conviction of our 
nature that the future will resemble the past are designated 
by the common term analogy as this principle is the 
foundation of all our knowledge of nature any attempt to 
overset it must be viewed as a direct attack upon the 
existence of the external world and therefore must be met 
before we attempt to expound the leading inferential forms 
by which its laws are established 

but beyond the objections whose confutation we have 
already attempted we meet with no direct assault upon this 
principle unless from the solitary pen of hume who con 
tended that the principle of analogy could not be maintained 
without falling into the sophism so often adverted to for 
it is impossible to affirm a likeness between two things one 
of which we have never seen or heard of we ought there 
fore to know the future in order to compare it with the 
present and the assumption of this knowledge which is 
required to be proved is the only foundation on which 
analogy rests but this argument supposes that analogy is 
an experimental truth which hume affirms it must be if it 
be any truth at all since it is obviously neither neces 
sary or identical the confusion however lurks in the 
word necessary it is not necessary as we have already 
shown in the sense of the highest metaphysical truth that 
is independent of all condition but it is necessary in the 
supposition that it does not depend upon experience but 
has been blended with the primordial elements of the mind 
with a view to guide its inferences with respect to the objects 
which envelope and surround its being in this sense the 

 we have shown in a former chapter we do not derive these axioms 
from experience but from an instinct which precedes or is coexistent 
with experience the establishment of this truth shows that inductive 
inference does not differ from demonstrative in the threefold character 
of the judgments involved in its illation of course those who 

refuse to admit the testimony of sense as a certain motive of judgment 
place analogy in the same category as wolf logica p 



c it humes objection to analogy 

word necessary is sufficient to raise it out of the category 
of experimental truth and rescue it from the objection 
which is only brought against it as belonging to that 
category 

but even on the ground of its being an experimental truth 
we think the view of this illustrious sceptic cannot be main 
tained for it is undoubtedly in our power to regard every 
moment of existence as future in relation to the first instant 
which memory can recal and every subsequent moment as 
past relative to the objects which succeeded it and future 
with regard to the moments already past thus every instant 
unless the first may be regarded as either past or future and 
running over these several moments we may perceive that 
the course of nature has invariably presented the future like 
the past and from the comparison are entitled to infer 
that it always will continue to do so without the illogical 
consequence which hume attributed to such an illation 

it may be important to observe that the analogy produced 
by certain knowledge is not to be confounded with con 
jecture for though intellectual superiority consists in 
some degree of the skill which is exhibited in employing the 
experience of the past to foresee the future yet the results 
are never more than probable as the will of man and the 
capricious nature of human events which refuse to submit 
themselves to the calculations of the exact sciences are liable 
to defeat the wisest prognostications the astronomer fore 
seeing with certainty what will be the future relations of 
celestial phenomena in a given time is able to determine 
the exact moment of the equinoxes and predict lunar and 
solar eclipses because a constant experience manifests to 
him the laws of the motions of the heavenly bodies and 
mathematical knowledge applied to observation gives him 
infallible results but if he turn his horoscope on the future 
of society both the vacillating nature of the will and the 
ignorance of the motives which determine its action in any 
weighty crises the sudden appearance of great men on the 
scene who unexpectedly found overset or remodel religious 
governments and dynasties prevent anything further than

probability even in predictions which fall within our own 
time while with regard to those which extend beyond it 
even probability in some respects is unattainable if the 
arms of the republic had been victorious at filippi what 
would have been the future of borne if bonapartes 
father had not married a corsican and thus brought that 
general into the world what would have been the condition 
of france now 

 reason an ultimate source of evidence 

another primitive motive of belief is reasoning or the 
necessity we feel in any legitimate argument of admitting 
the conclusion when we have conceded the premises the 
legitimacy of such a motive cannot be proved without as 
suming the thing in dispute and even those who deny its 
authority can only make out their case by an appeal to the 
authority which they call in question sextus empiricus 
however attacked the veracity of reasoning first on the 
ground that the majority of men who employ its methods 
come to different conclusions and secondly that since it is 
impossible to prove everything the whole structure of in 
ference rests upon assumed principles and partakes of the 
uncertain character of their foundation the first argument 
is logically vicious as the conclusion contains an illation 
more universal than the premiss being tantamount to this 
 some men have reasoned badly therefore none can reason 
correctly but as all men who reason admit the veracity of 
the means of knowing why does not their united agreement 
in some particulars coerce the sceptics into the admission of 
some truth if the discrepancy of opinion which men manifest 
furnish them with a motive for suspending their judgment 
even if the inference be granted it is at the expense of a 
double inconsistency 

from the premiss of their second argument that all 
truth is incapable of being demonstrated it does not at all 
follow that no inference is certain but points to a totally 
opposite conclusion that all the layers of stone which an 
edifice comprises are not indented into corresponding layers 
beneath them but that the first pile rests upon solid rock 
if it go to establish anything it surely is the security of the 
building so situate now on such solid rock repose primitive 



c iv authobity when unimpeachable 

truths for they are vouched for by the direct evidence of 
consciousness than which there can be no higher security in 
nature but the sceptics seem to forget in urging such 
objections they suppose the authority of reason in the act 
of destroying it and thus commit palpable suicide on their 
own principles they are in the position of the woodman 
who was so busy in felling the branches of a tree that he 
cut off the very bough on which he was standing 

 authority an ultimate source of evidence 

as man is unable to exist in all times and places or to 
assure himself of the certainty of every link of evidence 
which demands his attention he cannot avoid resting his 
belief on the authority of others if he would travel beyond 
personal experience and in fact does so with a confidence 
not less certain than he accepts the evidence of his senses 
this certainty which is termed moral has been attributed 
to analogy as we may be said to infer a thing will be 
true under certain circumstances which has always proved 
so when the marks which attended its veracity has been 
fulfilled thus we have heard that there is such a place 
as egypt by subsequent travel we realise the truth of the 
testimony by which we were led to believe in its existence 
we read of the demonstrations by which newton proved 
that the inequalities of lunar motion was a consequence of 
the universal law of force and though we may not have ex 
amined the consecutive train of inference by which that fact 
was established we do not believe it with less certainty from 
having proved the correctness of similar testimony when we 
applied the test of personal examination 

thougli authority may as a motive of judgment derive 
collateral support from such confirmations we hardly think 
the main trunk of its certainty springs from other ground 

 hegel assumes the principle of contradiction or that everything 
has its opposite which enesidemus taught in the middle of the second 
century as valid ground for refuting the conclusions of legitimate 
inference but of course it would be perfectly idle to prove against 
him that one cannot be right and wrong at the same time by 

galluppi lezioni di logica locke on this account would allow 
no certainty but what sprung out of direct personal experience 



 foundations of evidence b it 

than that of the direct intuitive evidence of consciousness 
for postulating the durability of the laws of human nature 
it is quite as impossible to conceive a number of men sepa 
rated by gaps of time and dwelling in different hemispheres 
who can have no personal interest in affirming the truth of 
what they state and no common ground for acting in 
concert should conspire to cheat the rest of their species 
with a lie as to imagine that two straight lines can enclose 
a space or that the whole should be greater than the parts 
of which it consists moreover the direct pledge of con 
sciousness is required to certify the infallibility of this motive 
of judgment as there are many truths resting upon authority 
whose evidence is past and cannot be repeated which it is 
consequently impossible to bring under the cognisance of 
any existing personal knowledge we accept these however 
when duly corroborated with the same unhesitating belief as 
others whose truth is hourly confirmed by the evidence of 
additional personal witnesses and that for no other reason 
than the impossibility we intuitively feel of conceiving the 
testimony of man can be other than true under the circum 
stances we have supposed above these conditions may be 
thus formally stated st that the testimony be universal 
nd that it arise from nature rd that it be convenient to 
no sect or class and th that the testimony when it relate 
to present facts increase with knowledge 

authority has been attacked only in its theological rela 
tions and that by two distinguished sceptics but the argu 
ment of one respects rather the fulfilment of the conditions 
than the truth of the testimony which rests upon them 
gibbon states the evangelical account of the death of christ 
is not to be received as it lacks the testimony of cotem 
porary writers if that be so of course the main condition 
of the veracity of authority has not been fulfilled and our 
thesis remains untouched but hume boldly assumes the 
hypothesis of the conditions being carried out and asserts 
that even when accompanied by such marks of evidence 
authority is not to be trusted when the report it announces 
conflicts with the permanence of the laws of nature but 
the objection though urged against the reception of historical 
testimony in the case of miracles is really to be met on 
other grounds for if a providence exist who has impressed 



b v httme against mieacles 

those laws on material objects the assumption that he has 
suspended their action for his own wise designs is the only 
escape we have from the absurd conception that a number of 
men who could not possibly act in collusion should conspire 
to deceive people with no selfish object in view but if 
no providence exist and we believe hume was not disposed 
to rest his argument on that ground the assumption that 
those laws could be suspended without material agency could 
not of course be entertained and the hypothesis of the 
marks of the certainty of authority being in that case ful 
filled must fall to the ground the belief in miracles is thus 
resolved into the belief in the existence of god if that be 
denied the hypothesis can not hold if it be acknowledged 
it leads to a consequence it sustains the irrefragable nature 
of authority when founded on the unanimous testimony of 
men 

these six fountains of evidence constitute the criteria of 
truth in the widest sense if there be one criterion which 
exercises any prerogative over the rest answering to the 
description of cicero insignis ilia et propria percipiendi

compartments in which the structure of evidence may be 
divided and pointed out the foundations on which the edifice

posed this the leading portion of the treatise though 
capable of being pursued almost to an indefinite extent 
easily admits of being brought within the limits we have 
assigned to it as the only two divisions of the sciences whose 
methods are so radically distinct as to require separate 
treatment are the moral and the physical and the methods 
which each of the various sciences comprised in these 
two groups embrace are so homogeneous as to be dis 
posed of in five or six sections for the sciences included 
under the physical branch of the division do not exact spe 
cific methods varying with every subjectmatter about which 
each is conversant but with the precise stage of development 
at which they may have arrived they commence with the 
registry of simple facts and collections of instances and from 
thence ascend to the most universal laws or axioms through 
the medium of intermediate ranges of laws gradually widen 
ing into them while the moral sciences for the most part 
embrace the reverse process of descent from axioms of the 
widest generality through cases of gradually diminishing ex 
tent to the minutest particulars the methods entered upon 
at each of these stages are adapted to the further development 
of all the sciences which have reached them but since the 
same method by which a law of minor generality has been 
connected with a multitude of particular facts either by the 
deductive or inductive mode of inference can be of no avail 
in connecting such minor law with one of wider generality 
it is evident that as the growth of sciences varies the method 
by which they are investigated must vary along with them 
in the physical sciences however this development may be 
included in three stages viz the descriptive the inductive 
commonly called the experimental and the deductive or 
exact stage the first corresponding to the position which 
meteorology and the second to that which chemistry and 
crystalography at present occupies while astronomy and me 
chanics may be taken as examples of the third the methods 
by which any physical science is forwarded through its first 
stage may be comprised under the head of observation ex 
periment classification and nomenclature these lead to the

discovery of proximate causes and laws of the lowest degree 
of generality through the application of the canons of 
experimental inquiry the latter consequently form the 
methods applicable at the second stage while as a science 
is made deductive by the formation of theories and by 
bringing these to the test of quantitative laws the nature 
and use of hypothesis with the functions that mathematics 
play in the verification and construction of the exact sciences 
will comprise the last range of methods which enter into the 
highest development of physics to the complete explana 
tion of these different methods it is essential that some 
account be rendered of the general laws they are designed to 
discover both in their simple and complex states and to 
this end we shall add a section to each of these tripartite 
range of methods explanatory of the nature of the facts and 
laws they are intended to bring to light how each are inter 
woven and fit into the universe of things and the general 
entanglement from which they are to be disembedded but 
as many events occur or facts present themselves even in 
the physical world whose laws if they are amenable to any 
we cannot exactly ascertain one of these sections will be 
devoted to the exposition of the general characteristics by 
which such facts or events are accompanied and the methods 
pursued to construct out of them general propositions avail 
able either for scientific purposes or for practical utility 
hence this part of the book will embrace six sections three 
comprising the various methods pursued in the construction 
of the sciences and the remaining half generalising the multi 
tudinous cases of phenomena with which those methods have 
to deal 

the methods which the moral sciences embody are in 
many respects identical with those already described the 
only points in which they much differ being the deduction 
of individual laws and occurrences from abstract proposi 
tions which we obtain from other sources than experience 
and the dealing with multitudes rather than with individuals 
in order to neutralise as much as possible the uncertain 
element introduced into these sciences by the action of the 
human will the complexity involved in mental spiritual 
and social phenomena demand more subtle agencies to trace 
their laws than those which obtain in the material world

of the hour and continue to exhibit fresh phases at every 
stage of their development hence one or two direct modes 
of inference are inadequate to grasp the perpetually changing 
nature of the phenomena they present multiplied and di 
verging lines of argument are required such as those included 
in the negative process and the crossexamining elenches 
whose functions in moral proof are precisely analogous to 
those which the calculus performs in the physical sciences 
the explanation of these methods in conjunction with the 
purely deductive sciences to which they are applied as 
theology and ethics will constitute one section while their 
connexion with the mixed or inverse deductive sciences as 
politics or ethology where empirical data are blended with a 
priori principles will comprise another in connecting such 
empirical facts with minor or general principles either by 
way of direct proof or verification the canons of experi 
mental inquiry will be found directly available where the 
nature of the phenomena requires us to proceed by the path 
of induction but in the case of analogy and approximate 
generalisations a distinct section will be required on ac 
count of the shifting nature of the evidence and the in 
fluence in much of the data of the capricious element of 
human volition it will be observed that the methods in 
this arm of the division are more irregular in their applica 
tion than those belonging to the physical branch since 
instead of varying simply with the growth of the sciences 
they adapt their form to the specific matter with which each 
is conversant as the subjects however which they embrace 
are not of so multiform a character the methods are capable 
of being included within less limits than those of the physical 
sciences embracing only the three sections we have assigned 
them an additional one however being added by way of 
preliminary exposition of the nature of liberty and necessity 
and the general objects about which it is the province of the 
subsequent sections to treat

methods of the physical sciences 

 the nature grounds and limits of physical 
investigation 

the object of the inductive sciences may be said to be the 
pointing out what uniformities are perpetually occurring in 
nature and placing in evidence the causes or laws upon 
which their existence depend we hear for instance a 
sound when a musical chord is struck and on instituting an 
inquiry into the cause of the phenomena find it to consist 
in the communication of motion from the sounding body to 
the adjoining particles of the air and the propagation of 
motion from particle to particle of such intermedium till 
it reach those contiguous to the ear which convey the 
impression to the auditory nerves and from thence to 
the brain the investigation however does not terminate 
in extricating the ultimate cause of the phenomena but 
merely presents us with simpler causes into which its com 
plexity may be resolved viz the cause of motion and sensa 
tion though we have no infallible proof that the latter 
causes are ultimate and indeed strong presumptive evidence 
that they are complex phenomena it is usual to place them 
in the former category at least until science enables us to 
complete the analysis of the parts into which they are 
capable of being resolved whether ultimate causes or 
laws are attainable by the methods upon which science 
relies for its most successful prosecution or whether mans 
faculties are too gross to discern them in the undiscernible 
molecules and corpuscular motions in which they may be 
supposed to reside it is not for man in the present state of 
science to hazard an assertion suffice it to say that those 
properties which appear ultimate such as the gravity of 
matter the mutual attractions and repulsions of its particles 
the equal pressure of liquids in all directions are generally 
considered in the light of original causes while the unifor 
mities into which these enter as active agents are ordinarily 
regarded as derivative ones for example the rise of mer 
cury in the torricellian tube is nothing more than an in 

o

stance of pressure on a fluid in one direction unopposed by 
an equal pressure in the contrary direction producing 
motion which does not cease till equilibrium is restored 
but the uniformity in question is regarded as derivative 
since it is fully accounted for by the weight of the air acting 
on a body which distributes the pressure communicated to it 
throughout all its parts with equal intensity hence the 
variations of mercury in the barometer in proportion to the 
density of the atmosphere may be said to take place accord 
ing to a derivative law while the two laws in which it 
eventuates may be considered as ultimate until we are able 
to disentangle the skein of causes which compose their re 
sults and estimate their effects in like manner 

as complex uniformities like the instances we have ad 
duced are virtually implied in the simpler ones of which 
they are the spontaneous effects and consequently do not 
require a separate act of creative will to necessitate their 
existence the designation of laws of nature has been denied 
them by an acute writer who seems disposed to restrict 
the term to those laws which do not admit of subordinate 
analysis but the statement is upheld in the absence of a 
distinction which is essential to the subject as going to the 
bottom of the dispute about the nature of the causes and 
laws which it is the function of scientific methods to dis 
cover for it is evident that laws may be considered ulti 
mate with respect to the bodies through which they mani 
fest their agency which are however not the less resolvable 
into the simpler elements or laws out of which the substance 
arises whose properties they constitute thus the cohesion 
and capillarity of the parts of liquids perish when they are 
resolved into the expansible fluids out of whose combination 
they sprung but it is nevertheless certain that such co 
hesion arose from the increased attraction with which the 
union of the elementary gases invested the minute particles 
of which the resulting liquid was composed or assuming 
the reverse case of the conversion of an inexpansible fluid 
into a solid a process of continual occurrence in the animal 
system as the liquid approaches a viscid state mobility 
among its parts or the law of the propagation of equal

peculiarly unfortunate his third ultimate uniformity as we instance 
in the text being only a corollary of the second 



c i causes and laws 

pressure in all directions gradually disappear though there 
cannot be the slightest doubt that the change is effected by 
neutralising the peculiar combination of attractive and re 
pulsive properties which constitute the laws into which that 
mobility may be resolved now to grant that those laws 
which are only ultimate in the extreme sense are solely entitled 
to be regarded as laws of nature would be to invalidate 
even the claims of those to that designation which form the 
boundary of the present state of scientific analysis for there 
are none so simple which chemistry does not promise to 
resolve into more elementary laws while the concession of 
ultimative properties in the relative sense would not afford 
any ground for the theory that such only can be justly 
termed laws of nature as requiring a separate fiat of crea 
tive will since such laws arise out of mere combinations 
of ulterior properties which can be supposed to occur as 
spontaneously as the combinations which give rise to de 
rivative laws into which they enter without any specific in 
terference on the part of the ruler of the universe 

in reality with regard to absolute primordial elements 
nothing is known and the introduction of the terms ulti 
mate and derivative can only be accepted to distinguish those 
laws whose elements are known from others whose causes lie 
concealed but notwithstanding the inquiries which it is the 
object of physical science to institute into the laws of the ma 
terial universe at best only conduct to the proximate causes 
of things they for the most part point out the nature of their 
various properties and frequently reveal the ingredients of 
the substances of which they are composed this leads to 
a twofold division of laws really pertinent to their nature 
one as regards the action of substances the other referring 
to the elements which enter into their composition thus 
it is a law or immutable condition of nature that if two 
thirds in volume of hydrogen be brought in close contact 
with onethird of oxygen while the two gases are in an elec 
trified state water will be produced or that if silica alu 
mina soda sulphur and a trace of iron be combined in 
certain proportions the result will appear in the creation 
of lapis lazuli just as much as it is a law that planets 
move in ellipses round the sun each describing equal 
areas in equal times or that in their orbits the squares of 
the periodical times are proportional to the cubes of the dis 



 methods of the physical sciences b t 

tances although we know in the latter case that these 
different properties of planetary motion are resolvable into 
laws still more general which may be in turn deduced from 
the peculiar combination of centripetal and tangential force 
in which they originate while we are as certain that in the 
former the proximate substances of which water and ultra 
marineblue have been shown to consist admit of resolution 
through different stages of more elementary substances into 
the simplest results that chemistry has laid open to us the 
causes therefore which scientific methods seek to discover 
always imply laws since they exist through their agency 
but laws cannot be regarded without some laxity in the use 
of language as synonymous with causes unless when in 
addition to the signification of the measure of the forces by 
which other substances and properties act they generate 
new substances and new properties or in other words new 
laws but the web of cause and effect is so intricately 
blended in nature that we know of no existing law which 
does not produce and may not be consequently deemed the 
cause of its effect so that philosophers are conjointly agreed 
in viewing the two terms as interchangeable in the language 
of natural science the elliptical motion of a planet for 
instance though the final result of certain elementary forces 
is one of the principal conditions on which the return of the 
seasons depend and the periodical succession of the seasons 
is again an essential element in the production and renova 
tion of the internal economy of the planet 

the causes then whose discovery forms the object of 
scientific pursuit may be assumed to be the essential physical 
conditions or material agencies on which the different 
uniformities in nature invariably depend whether such 
agency be the derivative effect of original selfacting agents 
as is the notion of the development theory both in its 
ancient and modern aspects or are ultimate agencies them 
selves or the result of ultimate agencies created and set in 
action by the direct fiat of god as is the theistical doctrine 
of the original agents and the primary forces into which the 
whole phenomena of the material universe may be resolved 
science takes no direct cognisance unless through the medium 
of the derivative and intermediate causes whose action is 
capable of sensible analysis whether such agents exist or 
are appreciable by the human faculties science takes no 



 i problem of inductive science 

account attempts have been made to grasp them at an 
earlier period of the earth by seizing upon some vague 
assumption as the radical element of all things and seeking 
to evolve out of it the constituent furniture of the universe 
but such efforts beyond originating in casual discoveries of 
trifling importance have recoiled upon their promoters and 
left science even after the toil of ages much in the condition 
of the stone of sysiphus with no ulterior prospect of ad 
vancement warned by the futility of such efforts modern 
inquirers are content to take such truths as the analysis of 
sensible phenomena offers being convinced that if remote or 
primary elements exist the only path by which they are 
attainable lies through the proximate causes which express 
their complex results and as the investigation of these 
afford ample room and verge for the employment of their 
highest faculties and the augmentation of their dominion 
over nature they concentrate their attention on their dis 
covery with the assurance that if such proximate causes do 
not conduct to primary elements that the pursuit of ulti 
mate causes is hopeless accordingly astronomers do not 
seek to discover the origin of the planetary movements in 
the application of a determinate projectile force in a deter 
minate direction but take such force as already existing 
and endeavour to follow it out into its results and trace 
its laws or the causes of its different combinations in like 
manner philosophical chemists no more aim at determining 
the one essential element out of which all matter is framed 
than sober geologists attempt to infer the origin of our 
system or the condition of the earth at creation from the 
present collocations of strata which compose its crust the 
discoveries it is true in these sciences which the steady 
adhesion to philosophic methods is constantly bringing to 
light are ever tending in this direction but this approach 
like that of the asymptotes may have a limit and never reach 
its object though constantly approximating to it on ac 
count of this direct tendency of scientific discoveries to 
simplify the multifarious uniformities existing throughout 
nature and trace them through a gradually diminishing 
series of subordinate uniformities to the fewest simplest 
uniformities cognisable by the human faculties the problem 
which the scientific methods are intended to resolve may be 
stated to be what are the fewest general elements into 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

which the existing uniformities of nature may be resolved 
and what are the laws which guide such elements into their 
complex results and necessitate their existing collocations 

as a preliminary step towards the solution of such problem 
it is important to remember that the grounds on which the in 
quiry proceeds are independent of experience though all the 
subsequent processes are either determined by the results of 
experience or are amenable to them by way of verification 
we cannot help believing that certain properties which we 
have once perceived to accompany certain substances will 
invariably accompany them and that the connexion be 
tween them has existed since such substances came into 
being we believe that wood will burn a century hence if 
fire be applied to it just as we believe it burned some four 
thousand years ago iu assyria or as we believe it burns to 
day in cochin china under similar circumstances this class of 
uniformities comprise the first spontaneous inductions which 
the philosopher is obliged to accept in common with the child 
and the peasant as the groundwork of his reasonings and to 
employ them in the commencement as guiding marks by 
which he may be led to discover the unknown uniformities 
which exist in nature to attempt their proof would involve 
him in what logicians call a vicious circle just as much as if 
he were to demonstrate any other primitive truth since he 
could not establish their cogency without the medium of the 
truths already built upon the assumption of their correct 
ness were such inductions referable to mere experience 
it is obvious they must wax strong by repetition and be 
consequently weaker in the child than in the adult and ob 
tain greater credence now than in the infancy of the world 
but all that we know of our progressive state and those of 
our species is in conflict with such a supposition a child 
believes that flour avill continue to whiten and water to wet 
any substance with which they are brought into contact 
when it has once experienced such effects as firmly as it does 

 we are reminded of an apposite passage in shakspeare which our 
readers will not blame us for quoting 

touchstone hast any philosophy in thee shepherd 

corin no more than that i know that the property of rain is to 
wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a 
great cause of the night is lack of the sun 

touchstone such a one is a natural philosopher 

as you like it act iii sc ii 



c i twofold natube of inductions 

after a hundred thousand repetitions of the same impres 
sion nor have we any reason to believe that the faith of 
the ancients in the permanence of similar uniformities was 
inferior to our own 

but whence comes it that credence in the permanent 
nature of such phenomena is confined to a special class and 
that many qualities exist which the mind never expects 
to find invariably concomitant with the substances in con 
nexion with which they first meet its gaze we believe that 
fire will burn and water will wet but never expect those 
objects to maintain the same colour we should esteem it 
little less than marvellous if having once tasted the effects of 
bread we should on recurring again to that aliment find it 
accompanied with the flavour of cinnamonjuice and the unnu 
tritive properties of deal shavings after meeting with a green 
chameleon however we should be by no means startled on 
a renewal of his acquaintance at beholding the same object 
assume a bluish aspect how is it that uniformity in one 
case is never looked for beyond the immediate instance 
while in the other it is expected to occur at every repetition 
of the object that some principle is at work beside mere 
experience is evident from the fact that however invariably 
some properties may accompany certain objects we never 
place sufficient reliance on the uniformity to generalise such 

 some may be disposed to quote the ode of horace ending with 
damnosa quid non imminuit dies 
etas parentum pejor avis tulit 
nos nequiores mox daturos

against the statement in the text but the allusions of the bard simply 
refer to a gradual paralysis of the powers of nature becoming effete 
with age and not to any capricious interchange of properties on the 
part of the natural elements which would invalidate our confidence in 
the constancy of their effects if the substances in nature decay their 
properties of course perish with them but no ancient of sane mind 
ever doubted for a moment that while the substances continued in 
their healthy state they would manifest other properties than those 
which his first experience had attributed to them there is no ulti 
mate principle of our constitution which urges us to believe the uni 
verse will always remain as it is against which the doctrines of chris 
tianity and the tenets of the development theory alike contend but 
only that while it does continue the substances of which it is composed 
will not manifest different properties than those on which their in 
ternal constitution depend 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

results or extend them beyond the instances we have ex 
perienced while in others one single case impels the mind 
to place no limit to the uniformity but to make it coequal 
with space and time the solution of the difficulty will be 
found in the sheer impossibility of the mind to believe that 
a thing can be otherwise than what it is or in other words 
that a substance can exist and manifest properties conflict 
ing with those which depend on its internal organisation 
now no philosophical instruments are required or indeed 
the slightest process of investigation to enable us to draw a 
line in the common elements of nature between those pro 
perties of objects which spring from variable external agencies 
and those which depend on their internal constitution a 
child has but to taste bread to feel that the nutritive proper 
ties it possesses springs from the peculiar constitution of the 
several particles of which it consists it has only to open its 
eyes to perceive that certain substances may be accompanied 
with a variety of colours and thus infer that such quality is 
not essential to their existence a crowd of similar acci 
dental and essential uniformities are spontaneously offered 
by nature and that written so legibly that the peasant in 
common with the philosopher may read them the only 
difference between the two minds being that the one contents 
itself with such as nature writes upon her surface while the 
other searching for the crowd of uniformities that lie beneath 
them asks what facts are needed to enable it to come to a 
sure conclusion and then looks out for these 

as nature may be regarded as an immense web of causes 
and effects curiously intertangled and combined the main 
difficulty in this research lies in unravelling the various 
threads and estimating the influence of each fibre which 
enters into their composition if one consequent were only 
the result of one antecedent the investigation would be com 
paratively easy but in the generality of cases the opposite is 
the rule one effect being commonly the product of a variety 
of causes the influence of each of which in producing the 
phenomena in question it is necessary to estimate if we 
would come to a certain conclusion about its origin for 
instance in the production of the neap tides there is the in 
fluence of the sun moon and earth each neutralising one 
anothers attractive force over a body which admits of 
mobility among its parts to such a degree as to move in the 



c i plurality of causes 

direction of the impulse communicated to it by three distant 
bodies acting in contrary directions in ordinary parlance 
among the conditions of an effect one cause is commonly 
selected to which the result is attributed either through its 
being the principal or the culminating agent in its production 
thus a person in a feeble state of health takes mercury and 
exposes himself while in that state to night air the effect is 
sudden cold which is at once ascribed to the influence of the 
atmosphere though the result was doubtless as much attribu 
table to the mercury and his weak condition any statement 
therefore of the cause of the cold which did not include the 
three antecedent conditions must be considered imperfect 
again the death of the duke of wellington was attributed to 
the effect of some fruit pie of which he had voraciously eaten 
the day preceding his demise though no one could for a mo 
ment doubt that the great agent in the business was a general 
decay in the digestive organs which only required the slight 
temporary derangement produced by the fruit in question 
to completely incapacitate them for discharging those func 
tions on which life depends in like manner a boy rolls a 
ball which towards the end of its progress is stopped by a 
stone yet it is very probable that such an event would not 
have taken place had not the resistance of the air and the 
counteracting force of the earths attraction weakened its 
motion to such a degree as to prevent it overleaping the 
stone though the two latter causes are omitted in the 
account of the phenomenon when the culminating condition 
is superficially the most conspicuous in the production of the 
effect it is invariably set down as the sole agent in the 
business thus we say that the crowns assent to a bill 
makes it law or the casting vote of the speaker was the 
cause of the resolution on the part of the commons in whose 
support it was given and if we happen to be insisting on 
the requisiteness of such condition at the moment one of a 
negative character is styled the cause of an effect with which 
it could have no positive relation as when we state the cause 
of the army being surprised was the sentinel being off his 
post or the body fell because it was unsupported we must 
however be aware that as the absence of the sentinel neither 
created the enemy or made the soldiers sleep it could not 

 mills logic vol i p 



 methods of tub physical sciences b v 

be the cause of their surprise and moreover that the mere 
absence of a prop underlying a body could no more make it 
fall than the absence of any obstruction to its motion above 
could make it ascend or the removal of any lateral hin 
drance cause it to move horizontally all such conditions 
being mere negations are equivalent to nonexistence and 
from nothing nothing can proceed the real cause must 
obviously be placed in the fact of the stone being within the 
sphere of the earths attraction which impelled it to its surface 
with a force in direct proportion to its mass 

the cause of a phenomenon is therefore that condition or 
aggregate of conditions on which alone the effect depends 
its essential mark is in invariable and unconditional con 
comitance with its effect so that from its simple presence 
the result follows without the interference of any other 
agency mere invariable sequence between two phenomena 
proves nothing unless we can produce indubitable evidence 
of the fact that the one is the tangible result of the agency 
of the other day never ceases without introducing night 
and night without being followed by day yet everybody 
knows that day is caused by the sun illuminating our hemi 
sphere and that whether the night preceded or not the 
appearance of that luminary in our sky would always be 
attended with the same effect though we cannot help in 
ferring having once witnessed certain agencies generate cer 
tain results that wherever such causes operate unmolested 
by any counteracting agency the same effects must ensue 
we cannot inversely take the presence of the effect as an 
irrefragable sign of the agency of the same causes thus 
sugar can be produced from linen rags under the agency of 
sulphuric acid as well as from beetroot and west indian 
cane honey would not at present furnish us with undeni 
able proof that the bee had been at work in hoarding its 
sweets for that substance can be produced by subjecting 
starch to certain chemical processes death may be the 
effect of a variety of causes nor can we infer from the mere 
presence of a shell on a rock whether it dropped from the 
shallop of a pilgrim the beak of a bird or was swept there 
by the ever shifting waves of the sea 

the ultimate basis of such investigations evidently pro 
ceeds upon the principle that every natural phenomenon 
must have a cause sufficient to account for its existence and 



c i causal agency unveesal 

it is as well to ask ourselves at the outset of the inquiry 
what evidence have we of the truth of such a proposition 
and whether there is any limit to its generality in nature 
if such a principle spring from mere experience it is evident 
we are unauthorised to apply it to any other class of effects 
than those whose causes we have discovered and that a 
great many of the present researches of philosophers may be 
employed in looking out for causes that may not exist and 
eventuate in demonstrations of the indemonstrable and ex 
planations of what cannot be explained but such a belief 
no rational intellect can practically entertain its adoption 
would shut up the philosophers laboratory as well as the 
courts of justice since we could neither predict future results 
or infer from the present anything relative to the past among 
the ancients indeed to whom the material universe was a 
sealed book some trace of such an opinion may be said to be 
discovered in their doctrine of chance but that tenet by no 
means implied that objects could be produced without any 
sufficient cause but simply that the causes which produced 
them not being under the influence of any deity were the 
result of capricious agency a notion which modern science 
has completely destroyed by showing that the socalled 
theistic agencies are nothing else than laws so dependent on 
the internal constitutions of things that when once the tie 
has been fairly established we can in no instance without the 
interposition of supernatural agency infagine a separation 
accordingly the introduction of the word chance in the an 
cient philosophy instead of strengthening the empirical view 
of the question only proves the utter repugnance of the 
mind to the belief that an effect can exist without a cause 
since when man in entire ignorance of natural laws re 
ferred every successive uniformity in nature to the direct 
action of a deity rather than leave those phenomena 
which bore upon their front the marks of no forethought 
or design in their origin without a cause he at once as 
signed their production to agencies acting without rule or 
principle and called their parent chance but had he dis 
enchanted space of his imaginary divinities and transferred 
their functions to the agency of general laws he would have 
wiped out of his vocabulary the word chance as a notion 
impossible to be entertained he would have found it as 
repugnant to conceive a substance acting according to other 



 methods of the physical sciences b t 

principles than those which accorded with its own constitu 
tion as to conceive the same substance existing without a 
cause and have ascended with the moderns the ladder of 
scientific induction applying the law of regular causal agency 
to every corner of the universe 

as relations however may be said to exist between co 
existent as well as sequential phenomena a distinction is 
sometimes attempted to be drawn between those properties 
which are merely derivative and the ultimate collocations of 
matter from which they spring though we can give a 
causal account of the manner in which the threads are inter 
woven which compose the fabric of the universe and show 
how the figures are produced which dot its surface by un 
ravelling the skeins of which the web consists it is argued 
that our power stops here that we cannot pursue our inves 
tigation into the cause of the primordial fibres into which we 
have decomposed the fabric or produce any reasons for the 
proportions in which such ultimate qualities are found to 
coexist we can trace the influence for instance of the 
suns attraction and the tangential force imparted to each 
planet among the movements of the heavenly bodies and 
derive all the phenomena which such motions involve from 
the effects of their combination but it is said we can give no 
reason for the existence of the combination itself nor trace 
any coincidence between it and the proportions in which the 
other elementary agencies of the universe are intermingled 
in referring existing phenomena to their ultimate elements 
through a series of complicated effects we generally find 
according to this view that derivative laws do not depend 
solely upon the primary laws into which they are resolvable 
but imply in addition a certain mode of coexistence among 
some of the original elements of the universe now this last 
mentioned element which is not a law of causation but a 
collocation of causes cannot be reduced to any law among 
such elements we are unable to explain why one substance 
exists in greater abundance than another or why different 
powers act through various degrees and directions in space 
the original elements of the universe may have existed in 
the greatest disorder but if they act accordingto uniform 
laws they cannot fail to produce regularity of some kind 
just as the capricious arrangement of coloured bits of glass 
in the kaleidoscope through carrying the law of refraction 



c i final causes inadmissible 

into their subsequent movements produces a beautiful im 
pression of order on the mind of the beholder 

this reasoning however is founded upon assumptions 
which are not in harmony with the actual progress of science 
and in reality conflicts with the results to which the religious 
deistic and pantheistic cosmogonies would alike lead us that 
the universe grew out of primordial elements existing in a 
confused and disordered shape discoveries of modern che 
mistry tends strongly to contradict which show that the 
ultimate particles into which matter may be resolved though 
bearing evidence of essential difference among themselves 
may be arranged in a very limited number of groups or 
classes all the individuals of which are exactly alike in all 
their properties and when placed in similar circumstances 
exhibit no variety of deportment now as the number of 
such atoms defies the multiplying powers of the calculus to 
compute the inference is irresistible that the uniformity 
they exhibit has been impressed upon them by an external 
agent and that the evidence of variety which obtains among 
their indiscerptible molecules is just that very combination of 
properties by which such agent intended to produce that op 
position and consistence of parts necessary to generate the 
great globe itself and the universe which it inhabits from 
the ends produced in such case we can infer the precise 
collocation of original materials required to effect it just as 
an architect can tell on examining the design of an edifice 
the combination of wood masonry glass and other materials 
necessary to execute it to call therefore such collocation 
a confused heap of causes obeying no regulating principle or 
law is about as great a perversion of terms as imagination 
can conceive 

to say that final causes are not admissible in any account 
of this branch of scientific evidence is only correct in the 
sense which would place ultimate ones under the same ban 
of exclusion of neither inductive science strictly speaking 
can be said to know anything chemistry distinctly shows 
that the final results into which philosophical methods can 
analyse sensible phenomena are compound atoms which 
admit of no further decomposition by any instruments that 
human agency can grasp and with regard to the last word

 methods of the physical sciences b v 

which mechanics have to say upon the origin of planetary 
motion viz a certain combination of centripetal and tan 
gential force laplace has shown that both can be rationally 
accounted for on the admission of the simple hypothesis 
that the sun weakened by the enormous supplies of heat 
emitted from its surface has gradually cooled down aban 
doning successive rings of vapour consequent on the in 
creased centrifugal force imparted to it by the diminution 
of its bulk science consequently knows neither force or 
substance bearing any semblance of an ultimate character 
and to assume their existence in a certain manner in any 
account of its methods is a case of unwarrantable hypothesis 
which may be said to be fairly disposed of if found to clash 
with legitimate generalisations in any other department of 
science 

but in reality the hypothesis in question necessitates the 
doctrine of final causes and is found inconsistent with it 
among other conditions it supposes a period when these 
original collocations of matter began to act according to 
regular laws and in so doing involves itself in an inextricable 
dilemma for if matter did not commence to act as soon as 
created according to the uniform laws of the substances of 
which it was composed it must have existed either from 
eternity or from some antecedent period of time in amor 
phous shapes obeying no laws or in other words exhibiting 
no marks of change among its properties now this latter 
supposition it is impossible to entertain without weakening 
our notions of that steady uniformity of natures laws on 
which all scientific methods are built for what once hap 
pened might occur again if it were possible for substances 
to exist without manifesting any action uniform or otherwise 
between their several properties a suspension of all natural 
laws without the interference of an internal agent might 
take place tomorrow we are consequently driven back by 
the hypothesis to the notion of creation but find it completely 
at war with every notion of intelligent agency in the produc 
tion of the universe in fact there are only two kinds of 
cosmogonies possible either the world must have been pro 
duced by a spiritual being or the causes which we see at work 
must have no limit to their existence either in time or space

enounced it agrees with both the hypothesis which would 
circumscribe it within a limited range of phenomena will not 
admit the one and is completely sabred by the other 



 observation 

prom the foregoing view of the nature and objects of 
physical investigation it follows that the first step in the 
inquiry is the ascertainment of the particular effects of which 
the universe consists the several appearances systematic or 
irregular which their properties manifest that we may be in 
a position from a comparison of the results to get some 
glimpse of their causes by pursuing the analogies they sug 
gest and by subjecting the phenomena to such influences as 
the nature of the case shall point out as most likely to re 
veal their latent origin as long as the notion prevailed 
that natural phenomena was the direct result of spiritual 
agency that the whole of the present facts which the 
universe presents instead of being the infallible product 
of all the facts which existed at the moment previous 
were the immediate results of a divine intelligence it could 
hardly be deemed unwise in the philosopher to shut him 
self up in his room and to attempt to reason out the prior 
states or even the primordial elements of the existing frame 
of things apart from the fluctuating phenomena he saw 
around him but since the objects of nature have been 
shown to be connected in a compact web of mutual relations 
and dependencies and to precede each other in a regular 
order of sequence each effect being generated by certain 
material conditions which immediately preceded its occur 
rence every individual of which in turn were generated by 
others it is obvious if we would analyse this complexity 

 though metaphors are no arguments as lady hermione says in 
the fortunes of nigel we may observe in passing that the regu 
larity springing from the capricious combination of coloured bits of 
glass in the kaleidoscope is the effect of one unique substance acting in 
accordance with its own laws and that if any other substance were 
introduced into the arrangement in similar disorder the most chaotic 
confusion would ensue the simile consequently fails in that precise 
point where illustration was wanting that a confused collection of 
elements without principle or method in the assortment of their parts 
can ever generate harmonious phenomena though acting according to 
the laws of their respective substances we will believe when we see 
but not till then

with a view to attribute to every cause its effect to every 
antecedent the consequent which it produced we have no 
other course than to commence with examining the partial 
threads of which the web is composed viewing them in every 
light that is calculated to afford any glimpse into their in 
ternal structure and making a faithful record of the proper 
ties they exhibit in the various situations in which they have 
been tried that reason may be guided by the resulting evi 
dence not only to lay its hands on the direct mechanism by 
which they have been produced but to compute the amount 
of influence which they exercise over other elements and the 
modification they receive by being acted upon by other sub 
stances in return throughout the whole of this process 
reason can only be considered in the light of a subordinate 
agent she can only interpret the facts which nature puts 
in her possession one single result of experience is suffi 
cient to dissipate her brightest theories 

the mode of collecting instances must have distinct re 
ference to the point we have in view some requiring the 
registered observations of individuals situated in different 
hemispheres and centuries to establish anything in the 
nature of evidence coextensive with the subject whilst 
others are perfectly open to individual exploitation if a 
single person wished to discover the actual direction in which 
changes of relative level are taking place between the exist 
ing continents and seas it is evident that no exertion on 
his part could achieve his purpose unless made in consort 
with observers scattered over every part of the globe for 
the only way in which the point can be decided is to select 
on the most prominent coasts situated in different hemi 
spheres such marks as seem unlikely to change during the 
next century and ascertain their true elevation above the 
mean level of the sea in the interval by instruments adapted 
to the purpose but such agencies extending over genera 
tions and hemispheres can only be set and maintained in 
action by different governments or at least by mutual 
compact between scientific corporations 

the motives however which lead to the record of pheno 
mena may be various and provided the instance narrated be 
a faithful and complete account of objects before unobserved 
their registry cannot fail to be of the highest moment to 
that branch of science to which they bear reference thus it 



c i importance of observation 

had long been known that the cell is the type of vegetable 
structure that the simplest as well as the most complex 
plants are composed either of single cells or multiform aggre 
gations of the same vesicle but this truth was comparatively 
of minor importance until schwann led by the observation 
of the embryonic structure of certain tissues of animals esta 
blished the fact that the animal like the vegetable tissue 
originate in cells and that all the laws of vegetable cellular 
formation apply in every essential particular to the sim 
plest as well as the most complex organism of animal crea 
tion physiologists previous to schwann had while sub 
jecting animal tissues to the microscope perceived the ap 
pearances which indicate their origin in similar germ cells to 
plants but passed them by as something mysterious or too 
unimportant to be inquired into schwann on the other 
hand subjected them to minute examination and by pur 
suing the analogy which the cellular structure of plants 
pointed out to him opened the way to the most startling 
truths of the animal organism and completely changed the 
aspect of physiological science again a soap manufac 
turer observes that the residuum of his ley when exhausted 
of the alkali for which he employs it produces a cor 
rosion of his copper boiler for which he cannot account 
a scientific chemist on analysing the matter discovers one 
of the most singular and important chemical elements 
iodine which is found to occur most appositely in support of 
a variety of novel and instructive views then gaining ground 
in chemistry and thus exercised a marked influence over the 
whole body of that science the new substance is subse 
quently discovered to be a prompt cure for the goitre being 
traced through sea plants and other marine substances from 
whose ashes the principal ingredients of soap is extracted to 
sponge which had administered some relief to the victims of 
that disorder intelligent workmen therefore at this stage 
of the inquiry are capable of being of immense service to 
philosophy and might write their names in its annals if they 
chose to record every singular instance that crossed their 
path and noted all the particular circumstances attendant 
upon it the habit of minutely observing and particula 
rising the results of such phenomena could hardly fail to

suggest to intelligent minds analogies similar to those just 
narrated which might prove the germ of equally brilliant dis 
coveries physical science has advanced rapidly since bacon 
pointed out the great importance of this branch of the subject 
leaving a noble pattern both of the industry and zeal with 
which it should be prosecuted but had each one felt in the 
interim the extent to which he was capable of assuming fellow 
ship with so great a mind it is hardly too much to say that 
science would have been looking back on the positions she has 
reached today as mere startingposts in her dazzling career 

in geology meteorology and other sciences which can 
hardly be said to be out of the descriptive stage and whose 
objects are coextensive with the globe we inhabit the obser 
vations of great numbers of individuals widely dispersed 
are of manifest importance as constituting the only means 
by which these sciences can be carried through their infancy 
and connected by a series of intermediate generalisations 
with laws sufficiently ultimate to allow the deductive element 
to become an agent in their progress but to ensure the 
widest advantage to the labours which all wellinformed 
persons might carry on and to stimulate them in the pur 
suit it ought to be an object with every scientific body to 
point out in what direction certain groups of instances tend 
what kind of facts are required either to turn the rising 
generalisation into a law or to test its accuracy what class 
of persons are most favourably situated either by their 
calling or position for meeting with them and what at 
tendant circumstances are most likely to prove influential in 
modifying the phenomena by such division of labour the 
inquiries of large masses of individuals would be stripped of 
vague generality and concentrated upon critical objects and 
the separate results of their experience transmitted to a com 
mon centre might enable judges skilled in interpretation at 
once to pounce upon the law

c i canons of obseetation 

definite question or simply to register some peculiar pheno 
menon which has presented itself to us we must be careful 
to omit no circumstance in the account as the neglected 
condition like one of the quantities in an algebraic state 
ment might be essentially connected with the solution and 
so mar the revelation of the cause for instance the fall of 
meteoric stones being accompanied with flashes of fire issuing 
from a cloud and a loud rattling noise like thunder was long 
confounded with that of thunderbolts but had it been ob 
served that the flash and sound occasionally emanated from a 
very small cloud insulated in a clear sky instead of attributing 
them to electric agency philosophers would have sought for 
their cause in the very circumstance which separated them 
from that phenomenon in order to guard against such 
omissions it is necessary to have each of our senses brought 
in actual contact with the phenomenon and let nothing 
escape notice which affects any one of them thus if light 
ning were to strike a house we inhabit we ought to notice 
the form colour and duration of the light we saw and to 
what objects it adhered whether any smell of fire was per 
ceptible and if sulphurous metallic or such as would arise 
from substances scorched with flash what sounds were 
heard and whether we felt any shock stroke or peculiar 
sensation or experienced any strange taste in our mouths 
the modifying circumstances should then be noted such as 
the presence of conductors the neighbouring objects the 
state of the atmosphere and the disposition of the clouds 
after all this particularity the question how the house came 
to be struck would have to be determined whether by what 
is termed a returning stroke or by a flash of lightning pass 
ing from the clouds to the earth 

our record of observation should not only be circum 
stantial but faithful or in other words consist of what we 
have observed and nothing else without any intention of 
perverting the description we may distort simple facts by 
clothing them in the views and language of an erroneous 
theory thus if we said the thunderbolt struck with vio 
lence the side of the house and beat in the wall our hearers 
would be led to believe by the statement of a fact which we 
did not see that a solid or ponderable projectile was con 
cerned the smell of sulphur which is sometimes said to 
accompany the electric fluid is a remnant of the theory which

made thunder and lightning the explosion of aerial gun 
powder composed of nitrous exhalations the elder chemists 
were so addicted to the mischief of representing facts in the lan 
guage of idle theories as to falsify the descriptions of innu 
merable important and curious experiments in geology par 
ticularly the vulcanists and neptunists so far set the purposes 
of language at defiance through this practice that it was totally 
impossible in their descriptions to get at the facts observed in 
like manner faujas de st fond in his work on the volcanoes of 
central france describes with that particularity which belongs 
to fact craters existing nowhere but in his own imagination 
it is of immense importance with a view to guard against 
such errors and to secure our observations from the illusions 
frequently practised on us by the senses to verify or accom 
pany them with accurate numerical statements according to 
such measure of time space or quantity as they appear to 
admit of it was entirely to the omission of exact numerical 
determinations of quantity that the blunders of the stahlian 
chemistry and the ptolemaic system of astronomy are attri 
butable and the correct expansion of these as well as the rest 
of the physical sciences may be said to have been in propor 
tion to the extent to which their objects have been open to the 
legitimate application of this element all phenomena more 
or less admit of accurate measurement to such a degree that 
the very class which are so fluctuating and irregular in their 
occurrence as to appear an exception cannot be pressed into 
the service of science by any other means the thousand capri 
cious agencies by which the atmosphere is hourly influenced 
and the irregular action of winds tides and currents must 
ever prevent us from ascertaining either the general tempera 
ture or the mean level of the sea at any particular locality by 
the unassisted senses if we would reduce such irregular 

 herschels discourse on the study of natural philosophy p 
a vague and loose mode of looking at facts very easily observable left 
men for a long time under the belief that a body ten times as heavy as 
another falls ten times as fast that objects immersed in water are 
always magnified without regard to the form of the surface that 
the magnet exerts an irresistible force that crystal is always found 
associated with ice and the like these and many other examples 
show how blind and careless man can be even in registering the 
plainest and commonest appearances and prove that the mere 
faculties of perception although constantly exercised upon innu 
merable objects may long fail in leading to any exact knowledge 



c i use of expeeiment 

agents to any kind of law or hinder them from defeating our 
discovery of the laws of the elements with which they come 
in contact we must call in the assistance of instruments 
adapted to measure the precise scale of their variation within 
a given period and locality and combine the mean amount 
with the result 

observation even where supported by exact measurement 
in many cases will go very little way towards establishing 
the cause of a phenomenon unless we are able to vary the 
concomitant circumstances and view the cause generate the 
effect or vary in exact proportion along with it though 
there was every reason to attribute lightning to electric 
agency the fact was never considered definitely made out 
until franklin threw up his kite in the air at the approach of 
a thunderstorm and obtained the same sparks from his cord 
as invariably accompanied its connexion with an electric ma 
chine as nature is constructed for a widely different object 
than that of facilitating our studies it frequently happens 
indeed that she refuses to afford the precise kind of variation 
needed to establish the law we are in search of and leaves us 
to rack our invention to institute a case in point by direct 
experiment thus were it required to ascertain the principle 
in the atmosphere which enables it to sustain life we should 
find no instance in which nature produces either oxygen or 
azote in a separate state to enable us by immersing a living 
animal alternately in both gases to decide the question we 
are exclusively indebted to experiment for the fact that re 
spiration is supported by oxygen and also for our knowledge 
of the ingredients of which the atmosphere is composed 

hence experiment besides multiplying the advantages de 
rived from passive observation accomplishes that which pas 
sive observation is seldom adequate to perform it enables 
us to march directly to our object and to link it indubitably 
with its cause by experiment we are enabled to study the 
laws of nature in our laboratory and subject the wildest 
elements to our control to multiply our knowledge of their 
several properties by introducing such agents among them 
as seem calculated to reveal their laws by experiment we 
are enabled to bring theories to the touchstone of fact and 
prevent hypothetical fictions from spreading darkness over 

 this process concerns the doctrine of chance which will be treated 
of under the section of empirical laws

centuries and making genius actually instrumental in push 
ing back science instead of becoming an impulsive lever in 
its advancement to this element is to be ascribed the 
creation of physical science in the fifteenth century and 
much of its wonderful progress during the intervening years 
to its absence among the ancients must be mainly attributed 
their entire ignorance of physical laws and their subjection 
of nature to imaginary divinities 

it is however of importance to observe that the use of 
this great instrument is suggested in a large degree by the 
results the mind has gathered from pure observation which 
generally takes the initial step in the physical sciences before 
mounting to the cause of any phenomena we patiently ob 
serve its effects and examine its laws here pure observa 
tion alone is applicable but the results to which it arrives 
suggest in what agencies it may originate and experiment 
is ever ready to bring such hints to the test and where 
nature does not present a case in point to create an instance 
that will decide the question hence experiment is mainly 
applicable in inquiring into the effect of a given cause so 
far as we are strictly concerned with investigating the causes 
of a given effect the process is one of pure observation

minor laics their extension and verification 

having collected a certain number of instances bearing 
upon the chosen point of inquiry it remains to determine the 
nature of the evidence which will entitle us to conclude that 
u certain course is followed by a given effect or under 
what circumstances invariable sequence may be allowed to 
establish a causal connexion between the phenomena the 
marks commonly adduced in evidence of such relation may 
be generalised under four heads though in practice the 
actual signs by which causes reveal themselves are frequently 
only corollaries from them or are traceable not to one dis 
tinct cause alone but to two or three in conjunction it

subject to give the leading causes of induction in full point 
ing out their specific ground differences and merits and 
leave their mode of application to be gathered from the in 
stances we shall adduce in illustration of their properties 

the first mark by which we are generally led to infer the 
presence of the relation we intend by cause and effect is 
uniform connexion provided the circumstances in which the 
concomitance has been observed are sufficiently various to 
exclude doubt that it could have originated from any relation 
but the one assigned for instance let the object in view 
be to ascertain the cause of death produced by metallic 
poisons it is observed that arsenious acid and the salts of 
lead bismuth copper and mercury if administered except 
in the smallest doses destroy life now this effect obviously 
can only follow from the violation of some of the conditions 
on which animal organism depends so that the question 
arises which of those conditions seems most likely to be 
interfered with by the substances in question and how can 
metallic poisons be brought in contact with it the most 
obvious mode is to trace the effects of these substances on 
the composite ingredients of the animal system and observe 
what law or vital function of organism they arrest or enfeeble 
if the effect obtain in the separate parts at different periods 
of their formation in an isolated as well as in a combined 
state and if the remotest quantities of such poisons tend to 
disturb the same law of the animal economy there could 
remain no doubt that interference with its functions was the 
effect of introducing them into the animal system and the 
proximate cause of death in every case in which they were 
administered but the effect of placing solutions of metallic 
poisons in contact with albumen milk muscular fibre mem 
branes and other animal products is that the acid or salt 
having left the water in which it was dissolved unites with 
the animal substance and destroys its tendency to decompo 
sition the same effect is perceived in cases where death 
has been produced by these poisons the parts of the body 
with which the poisonous substances have been brought into 
contact not afterwards undergoing the law of putrefaction 
and when the poisons have been supplied in too small a 
quantity to destroy life eschars are produced through the 
destruction of superficial portions of the tissues which are 
subsequently thrown off by the reparative process taking 



 methods of the physical sciences s v 

place in the healthy parts hence the conclusion is patent 
that these metallic compounds when taken into the system 
cause death by arresting the law of decomposition in the 
instances adduced all point to the arrest of the same law 
and this could not have occurred with antecedents varying 
according to every conceivable mode of which the case ad 
mits unless they had generated the consequent apart from 
every other agent 

in this illustration we have proceeded according to the 
general route of scientific inquiry from the effect to the cause 
but it may happen that the effect of a cause is required to be 
known in which case we must find or produce the cause in such 
a variety of circumstances that it may be fairly presumed that 
the different instances could have no other antecedent in com 
mon then it is obvious that if any unvariable result appear 
in each combination of consequents that must be attributed to 
the cause which is the only invariable element in every new 
set of antecedents thus reversing the example already 
adduced as the effect of metallic poisons in every instance 
in which it can be brought into connexion with organic com 
pounds is to arrest the process of decomposition we experi 
ence no hesitation in attributing that result to their agency 

but it must be observed that this method which proceeds 
by comparing instances to observe in what they agree is not 
of very wide application as it is liable to be defeated by two 
obstacles at every stage of the inquiry either nature may 
not present or experiment fail to obtain instances in suffi 
cient abundance to ensure the variety necessary to lead to 
a legitimate induction or the number of instances being 
secured counteracting causes may interfere to modify or 
neutralise the agents at work and so prevent the instance 
from throwing any clear light on the inquiry in a great 
number of natural phenomena the effect is produced gradu 
ally and frequently diminishes in strength while the cause 
often goes on increasing in intensity so that the antecedents 
of the one and the consequents of the other become diffi 
cult to trace on the other hand the effect often follows 
the cause so instantaneously that the interval cannot be per 
ceived and we are left without any marks to discriminate 
the cause from the effect owing to the frequent occurrence 
of these cases the method of agreement in the generality of 
inquiries is incapable by itself of leading to a certain resiilt 



c i method of diitebence 

the second mark of causal relation between two pheno 
mena is invariable negation of the effect with absence of the 
cause and vice versa unless some other cause be capable of 
producing the same effect this may be styled the method 
of difference in the former method we endeavoured to 
obtain instances which agreed in the presence of the object 
whose cause or effect was sought in the present method 
we require on the contrary instances resembling each other 
in every respect but the presence or absence of the pheno 
menon we desire to study thus if our object be to discover 
if air be an essential condition of sound we need only place 
a watch under a glass receiver and observe its ticks fade on 
the ear as the air is withdrawn from the interior until by the 
completion of the exhaustive process they cease altogether 
here we have an instance of the presence of motion in the 
sounding body combined with the contiguity of the ear to 
catch the beats but unaccompanied with sonorous vibration 
or in other words the absence of one of the essential con 
ditions the cause with the negation of the effect on 
readmitting the air the beats are again found to strike the 
ear thus proving by the strongest evidence the dependence 
of sound on that medium and suggesting in some measure 
the nature of its functions again in the case of introducing 
metallic poisons into the animal organism if we can show 
that death is prevented by administering an antidote which 
shall hinder the acid from arresting decomposition by com 
bining with the animal tissues we should exclude the effect by 
taking away the cause or in other words prove by the 
method of difference that metallic poisons destroy life through 
the agency in question now such antidotes are afforded by 
the application of sugar sulphuric acid or hydrated peroxide 
of iron for each of these substances as soon as administered 
prevent by different agencies the salts of copper from enter 
ing into combination with the animal tissues and in this wise 
preserve the law of decomposition intact occasionally this 

 it may be observed in the two examples adduced that the instances 
in the first case only differ by the absence or presence of the same cir 
cumstance viz air under a glass receiver while the difference of the 
last consists in the introduction or exclusion of a single substance 
but as every substance may have innumerable properties the suppo 
sition is just conceivable that these antidotes may counteract the 
poison through some other mode than that of forming an insoluble 



 methods op the physical sciences b v 

mark of causation besides leading to the establishment of a 
general fact points to contrary or opposing facts as equally 
established by the same evidence thus if rust be produced 
by confining iron filings in a closed vessel over water the 
enclosed atmosphere will be found to quench the flame or 
destroy the life of any animal immersed in it now this ex 
periment not only shows that the remaining gas of which the 
enclosed atmosphere is constituted will not support life but 
that the ingredient of the atmosphere which supports flame 
and animal life must be attributed to that which the iron 
absorbs and which rusts it it is to similar inferences we owe 
almost all the inductions of daily life when a man is shot 
through the heart we learn by this process that it was the 
gunshot which killed him for he was in the fulness of life 
immediately before all circumstances being the same except 
the wound 

hence the method of difference stands on the ground that 
whatever cannot be eliminated without the subtraction of 
the phenomenon is connected with the phenomenon by law 
while that of agreement has for its foundation that what 
ever can be eliminated without removing the phenomenon is 
not connected with the phenomenon by law of the two 
methods that of difference is more particularly open to ex 
periment while the other is commonly the resource we 
employ where artificial experiment is impossible in examin 
ing the nature of any effect with a view to ascertain its 
origin we compare its points of agreement in as many vari 
able circumstances as possible the method of difference 
tries the causes which such cases suggest by comparing two 
instances exactly similar in every circumstance except the 
cause in question if with the same set of circumstances 
in which the presence of the cause is succeeded by that of 
the effect the absence of the cause is followed by its ne 
gation what was simply a suggestion before becomes an 
established certainty we need hardly say however that 
nature is not so propitious to our studies as to lavish such 
instances upon us if we want them in eight cases out of 
ten we must devise instruments by which they may be pro 
compound with it in which case the evidence would fall to pieces 
hence as the first class of cases do not admit of this barely conceivable 
uncertainty the conclusions established by them belong to the highest 
rank of physical certainties 



c i indieect method of diffebence 

duced the majority of the great truths established by the 
method of difference and they are the most important that 
science reveals to us have been extorted from nature by arti 
ficial experiment on the other hand in comparing instances 
of agreement we must rely on pure observation for the 
result unless indeed we can produce the cause whose effect 
is sought in setsof circumstances sufficiently various to ex 
clude doubt that the result common to every instance origi 
nates from any other source than itself a belief which as it 
grows with every instance is never of that convincing nature 
with that produced by the method of difference which 
enables us by one wellchosen experiment to lay our hand 
upon the cause and say indisputably it is there in the 
former method as the circumstances are different in every 
case we can never be infallibly secure that the constantly 
recurring effect may not arise from some latent cause or par 
ticular combination of the various properties which substances 
are apt to manifest in different situations instead of being 
generated by the constant antecedent whose effect that com 
bination may neutralise in each instance now the method 
of difference in its most rigorous sense excludes even that 
shadow of possible doubt for the two instances compared 
only differ in one circumstance the absence or presence of 
the phenomenon we wish to explore so that we actually see 
the effect generated under our eyes 

the two methods however are not unfrequently combined 
in scientific investigations though the juncture arises from a 
lax application of the method of difference in cases where 
the rigorous employment of it is impossible sometimes the 
phenomenon we wish to investigate is associated with a 
number of properties combined in the same substance which 
we are incompetent to separate so as to render the production 
of a substance impossible which shall exactly resemble the one 
in question except in the particular property we desire to 
study suppose for example the polarisation of light is the 
subject of inquiry the complicated phenomena which are 
designated by that name are impressed upon light in the act 
of double refraction or by ordinary reflection at the surface 
of a transparent body but we cannot produce any sub 
stance winch shall resemble either transparent bodies or 
doubly refracting crystals except in the one property of 
polarisation our only mode is to examine in what kindred 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

qualities polarisation ordinary reflection and double re 
fraction individually agree and differ and endeavour from 
the resulting analogies to get at the causal relation this 
mode of inquiry combines the method of agreement with 
that of difference taken in an indirect sense the in 
stances which fall under the latter branch instead of agreeing 
in all but the presence or absence of the phenomenon in 
question may differ in many other qualities besides so that 
although when conjoined with the method of agreement all 
doubt may be eliminated where the individual inductions have 
been sufficiently extensive yet the possibility is never com 
pletely banished that the remaining differences may not have 
had some share in producing the established connexion 
thus we compare instances of bodies which undergo putre 
faction with those which do not manifest that tendency and 
discover that water is always present in the one case and 
absent in the other and find moreover that salt which is 
an admirable preventative of this tendency in animal sub 
stances has a strong attraction for this element though the 
evidence amounts to scientific certainty that the ingredients 
of water combining with some properties of the substance 
produce decomposition we are not driven to the conclusion 
with the same force as if the evidence had rested upon two 
instances differing in nothing but the conjoined absence and 
presence of the element in question for in the former 
case the possibility remains that putrefaction or nonputre 
faction in the instances compared may arise from the pre 
sence or absence of other properties besides water this 
method however which unites all the advantages of the 
method of agreement with a modified portion of the method 
of difference is undoubtedly one of the most universal in 
struments which science employs its use is simple and 
obvious and the conclusions to which it leads are less 
exposed to cavil than those which entirely depend on the strict 
method of agreement 

the precise sphere of the application of this method is co 
extensive with that large class of phenomena which on account 

 it has been shown by liebig that the properties in question are 
carbon and azote the hydrogen of the water combining with the for 
mer and producing carbonic acid while the oxygen unites with the 
azote and generates ammonia now carbonic acid and ammonia con 
stitutes the gaseous compound which animal and other azotised bodies 
throw off in a state of decomposition

of the complexity of their nature will not admit of the direct 
method of difference and whose properties do not appear in cir 
cumstances sufficiently diverse to allow any cogent conclusion 
to be drawn by the method of agreement for instance if we 
wish to investigate the proximate cause of animal heat the phe 
nomenon being constantly associated with the living organism 
can neither be detached from a crowd of other properties 
nor viewed in connexion with any variable combination of 
them now even if we should observe in a thousand cases 
that all animals whose respiratory system is well developed 
and aerates the blood perfectly are warmblooded we should 
never be justified in attributing with more than probable 
certainty the phenomenon in question to the change which 
takes place in the blood by respiration but when we observe 
that those whose respiratory system is imperfect do not 
maintain a temperature much above the surrounding at 
mosphere that inference assumes the character of scientific 
certainty 

this method answers to what bacon called negative and 
positive instances and has been happily termed by mr mill 
the indirect method of difference 

the fourth mark of causation is that of residual pheno 
mena which remain in many cases after subducting the 
effects of all the known causes and which point to an agency 
that from the nature of the circumstances could only 
generate their production for instance in the return of 
comets there is perceived that general agreement between 
their observed and calculated places as to lead to the in 
ference that the sole cause of their orbitual motion is the 
gravitation of the sun and planets but when the effect of 
this cause is strictly calculated and subducted from the 
observed motion we find some diminution of its periodic 
time which cannot be accounted for by any other sup 
position than the resistance of a medium disseminated 
through the celestial regions now as there is good ground 
from other quarters for believing that such a medium actually 
exists this anticipation of a comets periodic time has been 
ascribed to such a resistance we cannot however be cer 
tain that such residual phenomenon is actually produced by 
the cause it suggests unless we are perfectly assured of the

 methods of the physical sciences b v 

existence of such cause and can also prove that no other agent 
could have produced the residual effect now as this rarely 
happens the strict application of the method of residues is 
limited to very few cases it may however serve to suggest 
causes which we may try to produce artificially according to 
one of the two first methods or which can be explained and 
proved deductively from known laws the last case is one 
of frequent occurrence and constitutes one of the principles by 
which science in our day has been so much extended thus 
in calculating the velocity of sound although the general re 
sult was sufficient to show the correctness of the cause and 
mode of its propagation through the air yet the velocity was 
a little above what could be legitimately ascribed to this 
theory laplace at length surmising that the residual velo 
city might arise from the heat developed in the act of con 
densation which ensues at every vibration of the air sub 
jected the idea to exact calculation and the result was at 
once the complete explanation of the residual phenomenon 
and an unexpected confirmation of the general law of the 
development of heat by compression 

the fifth mark of causal connexion is increase or dimi 
nution of the effect with corresponding variation in the 
cause an example of which may be observed in the method 
by which pascal satisfied himself of the gravity of air that 
philosopher knew that if the weight of the incumbent air be 
the direct cause of the elevation of the barometer that the 
column of mercury would sink in proportion as he ascended 
the puy de dome as the pressure of the air would diminish 
with every step he took the result of the experiment verified 
his conviction of torricellis views and settled the dispute to 
which they had given rise for ever this method of investiga 
tion which is called that of concomitant variations though 
constantly employed in conjunction with the other methods is 
mostly of use in ascertaining the law of permanent causes 
which it is impossible either to exclude or to isolate which 
we can neither hinder from being present or contrive that 
they shall be present alone to these cases the other me 
thods are confessedly inapplicable suppose for instance it 
arise as a suggestion that the oscillations of the pendulum 
are produced by the earths gravitation we can in no case 
exclude the earth as an influencing agent nor can we argue 
 a high mountain in auvergne 



c i method of concomitant taeiations 

from its constant presence that it causes the phenomenon in 
question for by parity of reasoning we migh t affirm the 
same of the sun which is equally coexistent in all the ex 
periments now though we cannot remove the earth we 
may modify its influence and that to a sufficient extent to 
enable us to decide upon the point in question for if as 
bacon suggested the pendulum tends downward in its oscil 
lations by the influence of the earths attraction it will 
follow the nearer it approach to the earth the stronger and 
with the greater force and velocity will the pendulum be 
drawn to it but the further the pendulum be removed the 
weaker and slower will be its oscillations a suggestion 
which professors airy and whewell fully realised by compar 
ing the motions of a pendulum in dolcoath mine with a 
chronometer balance and striking the difference between the 
velocity of the same motions as previously ascertained at 
certain elevations above the earths surface by the same 
method bacon also pointed out that the tides might be 
proved to originate in the influence the moon exerts on the 
earths surface if it could be established that the variations 
in the position of that satellite are attended by correspond 
ing variations in the time and place of high water the 
great newton subjected the phenomena to the laws of the 
calculus and proving the concomitant variation to the nicest 
degree of exactness revealed the laws of one of the most 
admirable contrivances in the economy of nature 

hence it may be inferred when objects vary according to 
some fixed quantity which is the ordinary rule that it is in 
dispensable to the establishment of causal connexion by this 
method that the phenomena should be submitted to quanti 
tative laws and their mutual influence proved to increase or 
diminish in the same proportion with the action of their 
causes now in such cases we cannot determine the exact 
proportion in which the relations vary unless we know the 
total quantities of which they consist thus in the case 
of contraction of substance since we neither know how 
much heat there is in any body nor what is the real dis 
tance between any of its particles on which its bulk de 
pends we are not in a condition to infer that the con

traction of the distance between them would follow the 
diminution of the quantity of heat according to the nume 
rical relation that the two quantities would vanish simul 
taneously it would therefore be hazardous to conclude 
that because the diminution of temperature in a body con 
tracts the space between its particles that we could bring its 
particles into contact provided the process of exhaustion 
was urged to its full extent in conjunction with the uncer 
tainty that beyond the limits and in circumstances of which 
we have no direct experience some contracting cause may 
manifest itself we have the doubt that the law of varia 
tion which the quantities exhibit within the observed 
limits will hold beyond those limits there are many laws 
of variation in phenomena whose differences are inappre 
ciable when confined within narrow limits but which mani 
fest a wide discrepancy when the absolute amounts of varia 
tion are considerable in such cases therefore when the 
variations which fall within the sphere of observation are of 
limited range there is considerable danger if the numerical 
laws which express those variations be stretched to a consi 
derable extent beyond the limits originally calculated that 
they will fail to support the theoretical structures built upon 
them 

the employment of this method may be occasionally 
attended with doubt as to which of the phenomena is 
the operating cause the only way to clear up the mat 
ter is by endeavouring to ascertain whether one set of 
variations can be produced by means of the other in the 
case of heat for example by increasing the temperature of a 
body we increase its bulk but by increasing its bulk we 
diminish its temperature the conclusion is obvious that 
heat is not an effect but a cause of increase of bulk if ex 
periment however be not available in the case we must 
look out for instances produced by nature in cases where the 
preexisting circumstances are already known 

 a striking example of such miscalculation may be observed in the for 
mulae by which it was computed from the amount of coal that a steamer 
of average horsepower would consume in a transatlantic voyage that 
no vessel could be found to carry fuel sufficient to supply the engines 
which she carried throughout the journey a computation which led 
many to infer before the experiment was tried that the undertaking 
was impracticable 



c i geneeal cautions 

it will be observed not only tbat most of these methods 
may apply to the same act of induction and so operate to test 
or verify the correctness of each others processes but that 
they are all with the single exception of the method of differ 
ence taken in its most rigorous sense exposed to the same 
uncertainty viz that the presumed effects may be brought 
about by the action of other causes than the uniform ante 
cedents to which we attribute them or at best if they should 
really act as influencing agents that their ubiquity with the 
effects does not make out direct causation but only a colla 
teral effect of it such uncertainties however where the 
conditions of each method have been satisfied in a suffi 
ciently large circle of instances and especially where the 
methods tend to verify each others results dwindle down 
to an almost inappreciable value they become therefore 
objects of metaphysical rather than of logical concernment 
in circumstances however which do not admit of rigorous 
precision in the application of each method a strong proba 
bility of causal connexion can only be considered to have 
been established or at most the collateral dependence of the 
phenomena in question on some common cause unless for 
instance in the case of concomitant variations we can really 
ascertain that the phenomena do vary in exact proportion 
to their mutual operations the result is only one of strong 
probability nor indeed can it be relied upon even when 
made out by quantitative laws if those laws only express 
the results of observation restricted to narrow limits 

where the induction however has been established by 
the fulfilment of all the conditions that scientific certainty 
requires we are not to throw our conclusions lightly aside 
when a single fact starts up which seems to convict them of 
error but rather to set the outstanding exception apart for 
future examination being convinced that further inquiry 
will either destroy its hostility to past results or verify or 
extend the facts which they have established tims the 
objection was brought against the newtonian theory of 
gravitation that it did not account for the perplexing ine 
qualities of the moons motions and several minor irre 
gularities in the planetary system which seemed violent 
outstanding exceptions to it further inquiry however 
transformed these seeming discrepancies into the strongest

confirmations which that theory could receive and ex 
tended its influence from those globular masses which 
newton had previously included under it to every par 
ticle of matter in the frame of the universe an additional 
instance may be cited in the law of isomorphism discovered 
by mitscherlich which announced that certain distinct 
groups of chemical elements of which all bodies consist are 
so related that when similar combinations are formed of in 
dividuals belonging to two three or more of them such com 
binations will crystallise in the same geometrical forms to 
this law there appeared a remarkable exception in arsenic 
and phosphoric acid which though seeming to constitute 
identical combinations with those included under mitscher 
lichs law yet refused to crystallise in similar forms but on 
further investigation the compositions of the two salts were 
found to deviate essentially from that similarity required by 
the law of isomorphism and a new phosphate of soda was pro 
duced differing from that generally known under the name 
of phosphoric acid in containing a different portion of water 
and agreeing in composition exactly with the arseniate the 
crystals of which when examined agreed precisely in form 
with the arseniate the removal of the objection conse 
quently led to a further verification of the law again in 
the same science it has been observed that though am 
monia is a strong contradiction of the law which attributes 
the alkaline quality of the alkaline and earthy bases to the 
presence of oxygen combined with one or other of a peculiar 
class of metals that there are almost certain indications that 
this exception is not a real one but assumes that appearance 
in consequence of some modifying cause not understood 
such objections generally appear in the form of residual 
phenomenon which when minutely examined are invariably 
found either to extend and corroborate the induction against 
which they were brought or give rise to an unexpected and 
novel class of laws 

st as the processes by which nature conducts her opera 
tions are frequently of an analogous character one of the 
most ready means of extending single inductions is by dis 
covering cases in which from the general constitution of 
things similar laws are able to act and endeavouring to 

 herschel stud nat phil p 



c i extension of inductions 

establish results precisely analogous to those already adopted 
thus schwann having observed that certain animal tissues 
originated in cells was led by the analogy of plants to the 
discovery that all the organs of the animal structure together 
with the original foetus took their rise in similar cells and 
reached their highest development by aggregations of the 
same or slightly different vesicles in like manner young 
was led to infer from the fact that two vibrations of sounds 
arriving at the same place by different routes either strength 
ened or wholly or partially destroyed each others effects 
that if the undulatory theory was true two rays of light 
might be made to combine so as to produce darkness a 
fact which had no sooner been established than it led to the 
explanation of optical phenomena of a most remote kind 

nd another mode of extension is that of examining all 
the cases which present the necessary conditions for bringing 
the newlyrevealed law into action a process indeed which 
commonly leads to the discovery of special laws before un 
suspected and explanations of others only empirically known 
thus faraday having established the fact that electricity is 
evolved by all magnets great or small even including the 
earth provided a conductor move at right angles to the 
direction of its poles began to look out for fresh instances 
in which these conditions meet now in the northern 
regions where the earths magnetic poles are nearly per 
pendicular to the horizon all horizontal wheels made of 
metal running streams and other conductors moving at 
right angles to the polar direction must comply with the 
conditions of the law and charge the air with electricity ill 
these latitudes therefore a larger display of the phenomena 
produced by this element must be expected and we find it 
in the aurora borealis 

another example of the latter kind of extension is to be 
found in the mode by which professor graham was led from 
the general law that gases have a strong tendency to per 
meate animal membranes and diffuse themselves through the 
spaces which they enclose to establish a number of special 
laws explanatory of various phenomena in connexion with 

 faraday does not attribute the entire effect of this startling phe 
nomenon to his law as it would be unscientific to do so he is how 
ever fully justified in the inference that it has a great share in the 
operation 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

the animal system thus malaria is accounted for by the 
tendency in the animal body to absorb those gases rapidly 
which are not already contained in the system as for in 
stance carbonic acid and ammonia the gases which putri 
fying bodies exhale by the same law the heat and in 
toxication consequent on the consumption of spirituous 
liquors may be attributed to the rapid spread of vapour 
throughout the system as the alcohol is driven above the 
boiling point by the temperature of the stomach these 
with many other explanations of phenomena to which the 
same law leads are only so many special cases of its action 
and started into being as soon as its acute discoverer began to 
inquire in what cases the law might be expected to operate 

now there is no place in which a new element is so 
likely to have influence as in those sciences whose subject 
matter is of a kindred character or which manifest phe 
nomena of an analogous tendency hence it becomes im 
portant when a new induction has been established that the 
property or law to which it refers should be studied as many 
ways as possible in connexion with laws which exhibit 
similar relations by this method of extension many classes 
of facts viewed as the nucleus of so many distinct sciences 
have been merged into each other and afterwards included 
in one or two general laws thus the class of properties con 
templated by magnetism has been resolved into two opposite 
currents of electricity and there can hardly be a doubt that 
the property of polarity may yet be similarly derived from 
those of attraction and repulsion and both in some measure 
shown to have a direct connexion with gravitation there 
is nothing so instructive as this pursuit of the consequences 
of a new law into cases where its operation is likely to 
be traced and illustrations of its successful action may 
be encountered at every stage of scientific history thus 
kepler having ascertained the orbit of mars to be an 
ellipse in which the sun was one of the foci and that the 
square of the periodical times was proportional to the cube 
of the distance sought the same laws in the motion of the 
other planets and found that each together with the motions 
of their satellites were only so many additional instances of 
their operation by a similar extension of induction to ana 
logous cases galileo broke down the barrier which aristotle 
had erected between the laws of terrestrial and heavenly 



 i extension of inductions 

mechanics and showed the motions they mutually exhibit 
were resolvable into the same dynamical forces newton 
had no sooner enounced the principle of gravitation than 
illustrations of its action were found in every corner of the 
universe and every minute particle of matter included in 
the operation of the same law in like manner selenium 
was hardly discovered by berzelius in the vitriol works of 
fahlun when it presently made its appearance in the subli 
mates of stromboli and the rare and curious products of 
the hungarian mines and thus it is with every new law 
and general fact it is hardly enounced before its traces are 
found everywhere and every one is astonished at its having 
remained so long concealed 

rd since each natural phenomenon is united through a 
series of mutually dependent agencies with every branch of 
science there is no induction which by the outlay of a little 
sagacity is not capable of leading to the most important 
results in whatever direction it may be applied the laws of 
light no sooner led to the formation of a correct theory of 
vision than kepler explained the functions in that act of 
each part of the eye and thus prepared the way for the 
invention of the telescope and microscope by which the 
kingdoms of nature were ransacked at both ends and man 
endued as it were with a new sense to enable him to 
explore her most minute as well as her grandest operations 
if we would then extend the boundaries of knowledge each 
induction must not only be looked at with a view to obtain 
exemplifying cases but also as a certain species of vantage 
ground from which the unknown in other sciences may be 
attacked with the greatest prospect of success the precise 
relation of each induction to the phenomena which surround 
its confines both in its own science and others to which it 
manifests a direct relation should be considered with a view to 
obtain further insight into their character as well as instances 
which extend and illustrate its action it was owing to the 
intimate nature which exists between crystalography and 
optics that the laws of light led to the discovery of the 
most important qualities of crystalline substances and those 
bodies in turn extended our knowledge of the laws of light and 
even in some degree decided the merits of the rival theories 
concerning its transmission so true is the remark of bacon 
that no natural phenomenon can be adequately studied in 



 methods op the physical sciences b v 

itself alone but to be understood must be viewed in con 
nexion with all nature 

st every additional instance of the application of the 
induction to new cases not originally included in the law will 
of course help as so many distinct illustrations of its truth to 
verify the correctness of the process by which it was reached 
nevertheless when the cause or law which it has laid bare 
assumes the form of an additional instance of a more general 
cause already well known and recognised the verification 
cannot be considered complete until we trace the action of 
the original cause as modified by the circumstances of the 
particular case and prove that the induction is corroborated 
by the result thus the law that salt preserves animal 
substances from putrefaction by its attraction for water 
could not be considered as completely established till liebig 
showed the phenomenon was a direct consequent of the 
necessity of the presence of water to generate the gases 
thrown off by bodies in a state of decomposition and in 
like manner the induction which led the same illustrious 
chemist to the relative functions performed by the serum 
and globules of the blood in the act of respiration was not 
fully verified until traced deductively from the chemical 
properties of oxide of iron the substance which the globules 
secrete and proved to be the precise consequences to which 
those laws lead when modified by the extraneous conditions 
on which respiration depends 

nd but when the law to which we are conducted is alto 
gether new we cannot rely on its enabling us to extend our 
views beyond the circle of instances from which it has been 
obtained unless it has previously enabled us to predict with 
certainty what will take place in cases analogous to those 
originally contemplated in such inductions therefore one 
of the most decisive means of verification consists in the 
application of the newlydiscovered law to extreme cases 
with a view to ascertain how far its effect is general for 
instance though there could be no doubt as galileo had 
convinced himself by allowing various substances of different 
weights to fall at the same instant from the tower of pisa 
that the accelerating power of gravity is the same on all sorts 
of bodies yet as extremely light substances could not be tried 
on account of the resistance of the air the law could hardly 



c i vebification of inductions 

be said to be established in its utmost degree of generality 
until the invention of the airpump had enabled it to be put 
to the test of an extreme case a guinea and a feather then 
dropped from the upper part of a glass cylinder exhausted of 
air struck the bottom at the same moment and rendered 
further doubt on the subject visionary 

rd where the inductions arrived at like those of con 
comitant variations belong to that class which require the 
application of the calculus their verification cannot be con 
sidered complete without every case of trial is one of precise 
measurement and without some of the instances chosen are 
of such a nature as to multiply any deviation till it amount 
to an appreciable result thus keplers three laws of 
planetary motions were only confirmed in the instance of 
jupiters satellites by submitting the periodical appearances 
of these bodies to the test of quantitative laws nor could even 
this computation be relied upon till it was proved that if any 
deviation existed it must have become apparent in the result 
the use of this branch of the verificatory process in har 
monising individual inductions with the results to which the 
higher laws with which they are connected deductively lead 
is beautifully exemplified in the mode by which newton 
proved that the law of falling bodies inferred by galileo 
was only another expression of the law to which his theory 
of gravitation had conducted him viz that the gravity of 
every material body is in the direct proportion of its mass 
now to ascertain this a mode of experiment was required 
which not only neutralised the interference of the air but 
also enabled the trial to be made a great number of times 
without loss or gain in the intervals the object was accom 
plished by inclosing in a hollow pendulum at different times 
equal weights of the most various substances that could be 
found and ascertaining the time required for the pendulum 
so charged to make a certain number of oscillations each 
substance having to fall and rise successively without loss of 
time through the same identical spaces it is clear that any 
difference that might exist in the time of one such oscillation 
could not fail to be multiplied and become sensible in the 
result but none such having been discovered the law 
above stated was considered verified both in respect of ge 
nerality and exactness

we shall now proceed to illustrate the general principles 
laid down in this section bj an inquiry into a cause whose 
incomplete investigation requires the application of the main 
points on which we have insisted such a phenomenon is pre 
sented by dew now at the outset of the inquiry we must 
precisely determine what dew is and separate it from rain the 
moisture of fogs evaporation of steam and other phenomena of 
a kindred quality and confine the term to what is really meant 
viz the spontaneous appearance of moisture on substances 
exposed in the open air when no rain or visible wet is fall 
ing b i c iii in the second place we must search 
for or endeavour to produce a phenomena identical or pre 
cisely analogous to the object of our inquiry b v 
which occurs for instance in the moisture which bedews a 
cold metal or stone when we breathe upon it in that 
which appears on a glass of water fresh from the well in hot 
weather in that which appears on the inside of windows 
when sudden rain or hail chills the external air in that 
which runs down our walls when a warm moist thaw ensues 
after a long frost now all these instances agree in one point 
st meth the coldness of the object dewed in comparison 
with the air in contact with it but in the case of night 
dew is it a fact that the object dewed is colder than the air 
to ascertain this we need only place a thermometer in con 
tact with the dewed substance and hang one at a little dis 
tance above it out of reach of its influence the result has 
invariably decided the question in the affirmative whenever 
an object contracts dew it is colder than the air st meth 
but is this chill an effect of dew or its cause that dews 
are accompanied with chill is a common remark but vulgar 
prejudice would make the cold the effect rather than the 
cause we must therefore collect more facts or which 
comes to the same thing vary the circumstances since every 
instance in which the circumstances differ affords a fresh fact 
and note the contrary or negative cases rd meth 

now in the first place no dew is produced on the surfaces 

 see wells on dew herschels study of nat phil p and 
mills system of logic vol i p we have principally followed 
the astronomer who has invested wellss lucubrations with such ele 
gant features as might have seduced plato into a study which he 
abhorred 



g i wellss theory op dew 

of polished metals but it is produced very copiously on glass 
both exposed with their faces upwards and in some cases the 
under side of a horizontal plate of glass is also dewed which 
last circumstance nd rneth excludes the fall of moisture 
from the sky in an invisible form that would naturally ex 
clude the vulgar attribution of the cause in the cases of 
polished metal and polished glass the contrast shows that 
the substance has much to do with the phenomenon b v 
 therefore let the substance alone be diversified as 
much as possible by exposing polished surfaces of various 
kinds the result is a scale of intensity in the phenomenon 
th meth those polished substances being found to be 
most strongly dewed which conduct heat worst while 
those which conduct heat best resist dew most effectually 
here we encounter a law th meth of the first degree 
of generality but if we expose rough surfaces instead of 
polished we occasionally find this law interfered with thus 
roughened iron especially if painted over or blackened 
becomes dewed sooner than varnished paper the kind of 
surface therefore has a great influence expose then the 
same material in very diversified states as to surface nd 
meth and another scale of intensity becomes apparent 
those surfaces which part with their heat most readily by 
radiation are found to contract dew more copiously and thus 
we obtain th meth another law of the same generality 
with the former by a comparison of two classes of facts 
one relating to dew the other to radiation of heat from 
surfaces 

again the influence ascertained to exist of substance and 
surface leads to the consideration of that of texture nd 
exten which presents us with remarkable differences on a 
third scale of intensity pointing out substances of a solid 
texture as stones metals c as unfavourable but those of 
a loose texture as cloth wool velvet and others of a similar 
class as eminently hostile to the contraction of dew and 
these are precisely those which are best adapted to clothing 
since they impede the free passage of heat from the skin into 
the air so as to allow their outer surfaces to be very cold 
while remaining warm within nd exten st verif 

lastly among the negative instances it is observed that 
dew is never copiously deposited in situations much screened 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

from the open sky and not at all in a cloudy night but if 
the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes and leave a clear 
opening a deposition of dew presently begins and goes on 
increasing here then a cause is distinctly pointed out by 
its antecedence to the effect in question nd meth a 
cloudless sky is then an essential condition or which comes 
to the same thing clouds or surrounding objects act as 
opposing causes this is so much the case that dew formed 
in clear intervals will even evaporate again when the sky 
becomes thickly overcast nd exten st verif 

assembling all these partial inductions with a view to 
raise from them a general conclusion it may be observed 
that all the inferences we have made point to that first 
general fact the cooling of the exposed surface of the body 
dewed below the temperature of the air those surfaces 
which part with their heat outward most readily and have it 
supplied from within most copiously become coldest if there 
be an opportunity for their heat to escape without being 
restored to them from other objects now a clear sky affords 
such an opportunity it is a wellknown law that heat is 
constantly escaping from all bodies in rays or by radiation 
but is as constantly restored to them by the similar radia 
tion of surrounding objects st verif clouds therefore 
act as opposing causes by replacing the whole or a great 
part of the heat so radiated away which can only escape 
without being replaced through openings into infinite space 
st verif thus at length we arrive at the general proxi 
mate cause of dew in the cooling of the dewed surface by 
radiation faster than its heat can be restored to it by com 
munication with the ground or by counterradiation so as to 
become colder than the air and thereby to cause a condensa 
tion of its moisture 

thus the inquiry may be said to terminate by resolving 
the laws of the phenomenon into two more general laws viz 
the radiation of heat and the condensation of invisible vapour 
by cold which become in turn capable of similar investigation 
and resolution into phenomena of wider generalisation the 
laws of radiation had however been previously established 
and received no new confirmation by the explanation of this 
theory which indeed they only tended to explain nd verif 
and the condensation of invisible vapour by cold had already 



c i sttmmaky of induction 

become a portion of physical inquiry thus the explanation 
of the laws of nature only lead to the resolution of a sensible 
knot of complicated effects into others more simple but less 
known and so far only substitutes for a mystery which has 
become familiar a phenomenon still more strange to ex 
plain natural laws means nothing more than to assign other 
laws of a higher character which modified by peculiar circum 
stances will lead to the particular consequences they include 

 general outline of the inductive method difficulties 
and limits attending the application of its special canons 

from the example already given of dr wells s theory of 
dew may be obtained a correct idea of the relative functions 
of the different rules of induction and the mode in which 
they generally combine in interweaving the partial inferences 
of which the texture of scientific evidence is composed the 
process may be summarily collected under the following heads 
st the obtaining a precise idea of the nature of the thing 
whose cause we are in search of by separating it from 
subjects which exhibit a superficial resemblance to it nd 
the collection and examination of every instance that seems 
to bear upon the inquiry including those which manifest the 
property in question as well as kindred instances in which 
the property is not produced rd the variation of these 
instances to reveal the law which they suggest as the proxi 
mate cause or the artificial production of others calculated 
to accomplish the same purpose th the connexion of 
such law with others of which it may happen to prove a 
special instance or the pursuit of it into individual cases 
with a view to ascertain if it rationally accounts for the 
peculiarities they manifest any law which concentrates 
within itself the united evidence of such an investigation 
must be accepted as the real proximate agent of the pheno 
menon for which it accounts 

hence it will be observed that no single method is 
ever sufficient by itself to raise a law of high degree of 
universality in the examination of instances where the 
law inquired into is modified by extraneous circumstances 
each method is competent to draw whatever induction 
seems warranted by the circumstances of the case but since 



 methods of the physical sciences u v 

a law of any degree of generality embraces several of such 
inductions the evidence by which it is established must in 
clude and harmonise all the methods otherwise the law is liable 
to be overset through covering more ground than its founda 
tions are warranted to support in the investigation of 
some physical laws however one method is more available 
than another and that to a greater or less degree according 
as the nature of the concomitant circumstances admit of their 
action these laws it will be necessary to point out with their 
correlative methods and the limits which some branches of 
physical science oppose to their action even on the threshold 
of investigation 

the methods of induction explained in the last section 
proceed upon the assumption that every effect is so con 
nected with a constant proximate cause that it is impossible 
to meet with an instance of divorce between them so that we 
may always infer from the presence of the effect the opera 
tion of the same cause we have previously assigned to it 
now we have already had occasion to observe that this is by 
no means universally the case the same effect may and 
often is generated by different proximate causes especially 
where its nature is the result of many compound conditions 
as death motion heat moisture c and this in so remark 
able a manner that the producing agents which alternately 
concur in the creation of the same property are frequently of 
a very dissimilar and heteroclite character what conditions 
for example can be so various and changeable as those on 
which heat depends it may be produced by friction by 
electricity by percussion by chemical action and the pre 
sence of the sun to argue therefore from the sensation of 
heat that any single one of these agents were or had been 
occupied in its production would be illusory in the extreme 

 an error which mr mill accuses bacon with committing in his in 
quisition into the cause of heat we do not think bacons mistake lay 
exactly where this distinguished logician places it bacon attempted 
to trace the different sources of heat to one common law so far his 
investigation was scientific hut he entered on the task before ac 
counting for the effects of the different proximate causes which pro 
duced it here lay his error as we are not privileged to merge minor 
causes into higher generalisations before ascertaining their special laws 
mr mill says bacon was wrong in seeking for an ultimate cause which 
might have no existence but if this censure be worth anything it 
would bastardise every attempt at scientific analysis 



c i intebfebence of plubal causes 

we do not hazard the assertion that each of these proximate 
causes of the phenomena may be resolvable into one common 
property on which they ultimately depend or that effects 
generally which are dependent on different proximate causes 
may not likewise be traced back to one source of ultimate 
causes as such science takes no account she is entirely occu 
pied with proximate ones and since a variety of these may 
lead to one common effect it becomes important to consider 
how this uncertainty affects her methods 

it is obvious that when one effect has a plurality of 
causes the method of agreement must be put out of court 
since we could not infer from the bare presence of a constant 
antecedent in the instances we had examined that it alone 
had generated the single invariable consequent which accom 
panied it but no other method is invalidated by it at least 
in the single inductions we make concerning each special 
case for if the constant effect varies exactly according to 
a direct ratio with the accompanying antecedent or if we can 
produce two instances which differ alone in the absence or 
presence of the assigned cause we need no further evidence 
that the antecedent produces the effect in the case in 
question we can indeed proceed further and generalise 
the inference predicting that wherever the conditions are 
which we have discovered the same effect must follow though 
we cannot reverse the statement and affirm the ubiquity of 
the cause with the effect in cases where the plurality of 
the cause is doubtful what amount of experience will warrant 
us to venture the latter prediction must be a consideration 
for a subsequent section 

but as the operations of nature are characterised by eco 
nomical simplicity diversity of cause is by no means the 
ordinary rule and the uncertainty with which it surrounds 
the application of the first method can easily be dissipated 
by a proportionate multiplication and diversity of instances 
it is no more possible that a single antecedent discovered in 
a crowd of most dissimilar cases should be attended with a 
constant invariable antecedent without a causal tie between 
them than it would be for the same antecedent to vary in 
direct proportion with the same consequent amid a number 
of unvariable phenomena without connexion with it such 
an element of doubt therefore only requires the method of 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

agreement to rest upon a proportionally greater number of 
cases than any of the others in order to invest the results to 
which it leads with the same amount of scientific value 

the consideration of the different modes in which causes 
compound their effects will help us to further distinctions 
with regard to the use of these methods and conduct us to 
the limits of inductive inquiry this composition resolves 
itself into two branches each of which are in some measure 
coextensive with chemistry and mechanics when one 
effect is compounded of many causes the result either mani 
fests itself in a composition or mixture of the individual 
causes which enter into it or leads to the formation of a new 
substance having no analogous properties with the elements 
from which it sprung for example in the case of motion 
if a body is propelled by two forces meeting it in transverse 
directions it will describe the diagonal of a square and be 
conducted to the precise point it would have reached had it 
been acted upon by the two forces separately hence in 
this branch of the subject if we happen to know the effects 
of the separate causes we can arrive deductively or a priori 
at a correct knowledge of the effect that will result in any 
given case from their conjunct agency in the chemical 
branch of the subject the composition of causes is attended 
with results of an opposite character if potash and tartaric 
acid be mixed together in certain proportions instead of 
obtaining a mere mixture composed of the joint properties of 
both we obtain a solid saline substance quite different from 
either potash or tartaric acid and not betraying any sensible 
mark to lead to their distinction not a trace of the original 
properties is to be discovered in the compound result this 
explains why mechanics is a deductive or demonstrative 
science and chemistry is not in the one we can compute 
the effects of all combinations of causes both actual and 
possible from the laws which govern those causes when 
acting separately in the other we are left entirely to 
experiment every induction terminating with the peculiar 
combination which led to it nor can it include other 
combinations in any generalisations until assured by expe 
rience of the actual truth of the facts whose recurrence under 
certain conditions it predicts 

now of these compound effects those which follow 



c i twofold composition of causes 

chemical laws are the most easy to investigate by the direct 
methods of induction owing chiefly to the simplicity of their 
development which arises from their ceasing to carry into 
the complex result the properties of the different causes 
which produced them they appear like ultimate properties 
disinvested of the involuted web of causal agencies and 
present marks so characteristic that their presence cannot 
fail to be distinguished among a crowd of surrounding phe 
nomena the methods of induction consequently can meet 
with no other difficulty in their solution than the failure 
of instances to reveal their causes present or the absence of 
artificial experiments to produce them on the other hand 
in mechanical composition the effects of the separate causes 
do not terminate and cease to form any part of the phe 
nomena to be investigated but carry their results onward 
until they intermingle with the homogeneous effects of other 
causes they are no longer simple integers existing in a 
distinguishable shape but appear as insoluble quantities 
some of which cancel one another while many others merge 
into one sum forming altogether a result between which 
and the causes that produced them observation is often in 
competent to trace any fixed relation whatever moreover 
it is a common feature of these laws to have their causes 
counteracted and exhibit no marks of action in many cases 
where they have spent their full effects if two equal forces 
for example act upon a body in lines diametrically opposite 
the body so impelled does not manifest the slightest tendency 
to motion but remains where it was notwithstanding the act 
ing forces have each produced its own quantum of effect or 
if a force act upon a body which it is unable to move we do 
not perceive any result proceeding from the operation of such 
force although an effect has been produced in the tendency 
of the particles of the passive body to move in the direction of 
the impulsive force but how can we expect to find the law 
of a tendency by an induction from cases in which the ten 
dency is counteracted could the laws of motion have 
ever been brought to light from the observation of bodies 
kept at rest by the equilibrium of opposing forces in this 
department of science the inductive methods are obviously 
inapplicable we have no other resource than to study the 
effects of each cause separately and to infer by deductive

 methods oe the physical sciences b v 

reasoning the result that must eventuate from their combi 
nation in any given case happily dynamics which embraces 
the greatest branch of the latter kind of causal composition 
is so far independent of the inductive methods as to have 
reached its highest generalisations and to lack nothing in 
their application to particular facts by the deductive method 
than a further simplification of mathematical analysis while 
the remaining branches which play a great part in every 
science except chemistry and physiology depend in a great 
degree on the experimental methods only with a view to 
obtain accurate data to justify and extend the use of the 
descending scale of inference 

and even in the two sciences just mentioned there are 
many phenomena which are amenable through a similar com 
position for causes to the same method and the tendency 
which chemistry and physiology manifest to multiply laws 
of this kind leaves us not without a hope that they are 
destined one day to become deductive though it would be 
of course impossible to deduce all chemical and physiological 
truths from the laws or properties of simple substances or 
elementary agents it is by no means difficult to believe what 
the general analogy of these sciences already points out that 
such particular truths may be deduced from the laws which 
ensue when these elementary agents are brought together 
into some moderate number of simple combinations the 
great law of definite proportions already has discovered a 
certain relation between the quantities of a compound and 
those of its elements which enables us to predict provided 
our data be accurate the exact proportion in which two sub 
stances will combine before actual trial and we are already 
in possession of some particular generalisations which indicate 
the possibility of forecasting similar results in relation to the 
qualities of compounds we have also the law of isomor 
phism already alluded to and the curious fact revealed by 
berthollet that two soluble salts mutually decompose each 
other whenever the new combinations which result produce 
an insoluble compound or one less soluble than the two 
former pointing in the same direction in like manner the 
complicated phenomena of life may all be deducible from 
comparatively simple laws which though depending upon 
certain combinations of antecedents may in more complex 



c i the deductive pbocess 

circumstances be strictly compounded with one another 
and with the physical and chemical laws of the ingredients 
the details of the vital phenomena even now afford innu 
merable instances of the composition of causes and in pro 
portion as their laws are accurately studied there is every 
appearance that more facts will be brought to light which 
will connect complex cases with higher generalisations and 
legitimate a further extension of the deductive element 

here we have arrived at a perfect type of those cases in 
which the inductive methods can be of little service where 
an unknown multitude of clashing and combining agencies 
being engaged in the production of one phenomenon require 
the aid of instruments to unravel more subtile and diversified 
in their application more potent and decisive in their results 
in the physical sciences such are supplied by the calculus in 
its deductive range and the ratiocinative process but these 
cannot be applied unless experience furnish them with suffi 
cient data on which to proceed or unless in case of the data 
being assumed the result can be brought to the touchstone 
of facts and clearly shown to accord with their actual 
combinations in proportion as the experimental sciences 
display similar effects and allow their various conjunct 
results to be traced back and consequently deduced from 
the separate action of the simple agencies of which they are 
composed do they become deductive and amenable to the 
highest processes of generalisation 

 nature of scientific deduction formation and veri 
fication of theories 

we have already alluded to the employment of the de 
ductive method as essential to the verification of single 
inductions when the law they reveal is found to be a mere 
exemplification of a higher law acting in combination witli 
peculiar circumstances two cases in point occur in the 
inductive process which led dr wells to his theory of dew 
it is a law for example that moisture which falls from the 
sky never appears on the under surface of substances so that 
the theory would be materially confirmed if an instance of dew 
could be brought which shut out that law as an acting prin 
ciple such an instance was produced in some horizontal 



methods op the phisical sciences b v 

plates of glass with their under surfaces dewed to the exclu 
sion of the upper which enabled dr wells to infer that the 
fall of moisture from the sky could not have produced the 
phenomenon in question again it is a wellknown law that 
heat is continually escaping from all bodies by radiation but 
is as constantly restored to them by similar radiation from 
surrounding objects now if dew was caused by such a 
modification of this law as the theory purported it is clear 
that in places where the sky was overcast and the neighbour 
hood much sheltered from the influence of the atmosphere 
little or no dew could be deposited an inference borne out 
by actual observation for dew is never copious in situations 
much screened from the open sky and does not appear at 
all in a cloudy night hence the theory harmonised with 
the deductive inference to which the law led and strengthened 
the series of partial inductions that pointed to it as the 
operating cause 

hence it will be seen that the inductive and deductive 
methods are closely blended together in the successful pro 
cess of scientific inquiry we cannot establish even by 
induction any law of a moderate degree of generality 
without the assistance of its correlative method nor can we 
proceed in the scale of descent unless the data from which 
we set out have been at some stage or other guaranteed by 
preceding inductions except indeed we reason hypotheti 
cally in which case the result will have to be verified by 
induction from the actual instances to which it leads thus 
dalton could not have inferred that a complete combination 
between two elementary substances in chemistry would 
ensue when their weights were found in a certain definite 
proportion unless by the method of agreement the law had 
been previously ascertained to occur in a sufficient number of 
instances to place its universality beyond the pale of doubt 
nor could newton have identified the central force of the solar 
system with terrestrial gravity without proceeding from a law 
which though proximately the fruit of a deductive process 
could not have been received unless verified by facts based 
on the inductive method the fact that the earth attracted 
the moon with a force varying according to the inverse 
square of the distance and the proof that this would cause the 
moon to fall were that luminary at no greater distance from 



c i union of induction and deduction 

the earths surface than terrestrial bodies with a rapidity 
precisely equal to the increasing ratio of their velocities 
could not have helped newton to his object unless he had 
previously ascertained that the sun attracted the planets with 
the same force as the earth attracted the moon by showing 
not only that the force in question led at once to the in 
ference of keplers laws but that no other supposition could 
lead to them thus the path by which we rise to know 
ledge must be often ascended and descended before we can 
scale our way to any eminence much less reach the summit 
no great principle can be reached by a single eifort or by 
confining ourselves to one method in every science sta 
tions must be established and communications kept open 
between all well ascertained truths of law that minor facts 
may be verified by the higher generalisations to which they 
lead and the correctness of hypothesis decided by an appeal 
to inductive laws 

there is consequently no necessary opposition between 
deduction and induction both are essential steps in the 
process by which any law is reached of moderate generality 
nor is there any reason why the physical sciences should be 
called inductive rather than deductive unless indeed that the 
former element generally predominates at the earlier stages 
of their progress the sciences however which have not got 
beyond their infancy are correctly designated experimental 
by way of contrast to that branch of physics with which deduc 
tion is principally concerned simply because they include no 
cases of laws sufficiently general to admit of extensive ratio 
cination and are consequently dependent on observation and 
experiment for new accessions to their store of truths but 
in proportion as conclusions can be drawn in such sciences 
respecting cases of a new kind by processes which bring those 
cases under old inductions do they become deductive and are 
open to receive the aids attendant on this method thus 
when kepler announced his three laws of planetary motions 
astronomy could not be called deductive the laws them 
selves pointed to no inference below them unless movement 
in an elliptical orbit a fact already ascertained by the in 
ductive process which led to them for the rest they left 
the science where they found it a mere mass of descriptive 
and statistical details without any common bond or con 



 methods of the physical sciences fi v 

necting principle between them but when newton showed 
that keplers laws were only partial inferences of a centripetal 
force varying directly as the mass and inversely as the square 
of the distance from the central power he linked together a 
host of particular inferences and established a principle which 
ultimately contributed to identify terrestrial with celestial 
gravity and to account for all the motions whether regular 
or anomalous of all the bodies of the solar system astro 
nomy consequently became at once eminently deductive 
an arch was raised high in air which connected all the in 
ferior stations which had been established with the highest 
point of ascent in the sweeping application of this prin 
ciple to the deductive range of inference no fact was left 
without its law and no law but what became included in its 
wider proximate generalisation chemistry on the other 
hand though pointing to results which seem to promise a 
great extension and simplification of its complex laws is still 
an experimental science and is likely so to remain until 
some comprehensive principle like newtons shall bridge 
over a vast number of the smaller inductions and connect 
them through intermediate links with its most extensive 
inferences a principle in a word which should enable us 
to foresee the result of any new combination of elements 
previously untried and to dispense with actual analysis in 
pronouncing at sight upon the ingredients of any new com 
pound submitted for inspection 

it is at this stage of the sciences when they are throwing 
off their experimental character that the principles of number 
and geometry are instrumental in widening their bases and 
imparting to them the simplicity and generality of their 
methods when laws act according to some numerical 
quantity or their effect takes place in space and consequently 
involve motion and extension or when they exhibit variations 
of qualities in exact correspondence to variations of quantity 
the reasoning by which they are carried down to their indi 
vidual limits may include among their premises all the 
theorems of mathematics from common arithmetic up to the 
calculus of variations the application of such laws to particu 
lar objects consequently becomes multiplied in a proportionate 
extent and since the truths of number already ascertained 
appear infinite there seems no boundary to the extension of 



c i legitimate use of hypotheses 

those sciences which admit of their influence but the intricacy 
of the problems to which the expression of their data lead 
the prolific generation of new truths which proceeds from the 
conjunction of a science already deductive with so potent an 
agent as number may be witnessed in the indefinite exten 
sion of the axioms of geometry as soon as it was observed 
by descartes and clairaut that every variety of position in 
points directions in lines or forms in curves or surfaces 
corresponded with a peculiar relation of quantity between 
one or two rectilineal coordinates in such a manner that if 
the law were known according to which those coordinates 
vary relatively to one another every other geometrical pro 
perty might be inferred relating to the quantity or quality of 
the line or surface in question thus it resulted that the 
axioms of geometry were taken out of mere lines and figures 
and made coextensive with the range of algebraical analysis 
receiving an accession actual or potential of new truths cor 
responding to every property of numbers which the progress 
of the calculus had discovered or might in future bring to 
light 

to legitimise the use of this instrument however and to 
allow free scope for ratiocination it is obvious where par 
ticular results are to be investigated that the general 
principle must rest on prior inductive or deductive evidence 
or at least be the fruit of a well matured hypothesis whose 
consequences are able to be tested by a direct appeal to facts 
lagrange for instance could not have been warranted to 
deduce all the known properties of sound from the laws of 
the propagation of motion through an elastic medium unless 
it had been previously established by experiment that every 
variety of sound was consequent upon a distinct and definable 
variety of oscillatory motions among the particles of the air 
where such preliminary principle is not reached we may 
indeed assume one but the details of the hypothesis must 
not only be shown to accord exactly with all the facts which 
it presumes to explain but it must likewise be proved that 
no other supposition could account for them thus it would 
not have been competent to newton to assume that the moon 
was drawn to the earth by a force varying as the inverse 
square of the distance simply because that ratio would allow 
him to accoun for the falling velocity of terrestrial bodies by a 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

similar attraction and identity of gravity with the central force 
of the solar system for in that case he could not subse 
quently have proved that no other supposition of a force was 
able to account for the law in question save one extending to 
the moon and proportional to the inverse square in the 
proof however of the existence of the centripetal force 
varying in the same ratio the assumption with which he 
set out viz that the force which deflects a planet from its 
rectilineal course and makes it describe a curve round the 
sun is a force tending directly towards the sun was per 
fectly legitimate for he not only demonstrated that the 
hypothesis which the nature of the phenomena had suggested 
led by direct deduction to the inference of keplers laws 
but he also proved that no other supposition could lead to 
them now keplers laws were facts resting on the strongest 
inductive evidence the case therefore was completely made 
out and the hypothesis became a law established by the 
method of difference 

owing to the limited extent of the resources on which the 
inductive processes depend there is no greater instrument 
for the discovery of scientific truths than the formation of 
legitimate and well matured hypotheses they allow pure 
reason to wing its flight through the realms of science eman 
cipated from a servile attendance on facts and to assert its 
prerogative over them by interweaving on its way that mul 
tiplied and ever diverging thread of argument through which 
a few inductions are connected with a labyrinth of laws and 
nature coerced to reveal her mysteries not one by one as in 
the case of tardy experiment but to surrender up hosts at 
once as under the talismanic spell of a superior spirit but 
in order to effect this object the law must be so completely 
made out as to render it impossible consistently with pre 
vious inductions for any other theory to be true reason 
must not do her work by halves she must show that out 
of all possible suppositions which the case admits of the 
theory which she produces is the only one that exactly fits 
into the exact frame of the phenomena involved in the 
inquiry now this can hardly be unless we have good 
grounds for the belief that the causes which the hypothesis 
assumes actually exist in nature and perform a part in 
phenomena analogous to the laws we would render an ac 
eount of thus newton correctly assumed that the planets 



c i functions op hypotheses 

were attracted towards the sun by a force exerted in the 
centre of their orbits for in every instance of similar 
motion around him of slung stones of balls or wheels re 
volving round a fixed point he never failed to observe a 
material tie existing in that direction and could not imagine 
that the bodies in question were retained in their circles by 
any other force the hypothesis consequently involved what 
he designated a vera causa or really existing cause producing 
effects in nature similar to the phenomena he contemplated 
and limited the range of admissible suppositions to the 
various possible numerical relations between the variations of 
the distance and the variations of the attractive force but 
when descartes ventured to explain the planetary movements 
by the supposition of vortices acting in accordance with the 
known laws of rotatory motion he attributed a series of 
effects to a cause which not only produced no analogous 
instance in nature but whose existence could in no single 
case be demonstrated fictitious or random suppositions 
even if they coincide with fact cannot be supposed to ex 
plain them the inferences to which they lead though ever 
so plausible will partake of the doubtful character of their 
origin and as long as nature refuses to decide upon their 
existence no striking illustration of their coincidence with 
actual facts can furnish more grounds for belief in their 
reality than a vague probability 

it is not however to be inferred because we know of no 
case in which the cause assigned by the hypothesis produces 
the effect in question that the supposition must be thrown 
away as idle or regarded as absolutely incapable of being 
transformed into actual reality nature works so secretly 
and produces even similar effects by agents occasionally so 
novel and diverse that it would be the height of presump 
tion to suppose that she could not operate by other causes 
than those of which we were already cognisant and that 
the augmentation of future coincidences between the doubt 
ful agent and the visible effects might not at some future 
stage transform the alleged hypothesis into fact even if 
this desirable result should not happen yet if the hypothesis 
enables us to group together several laws under wider gene 

 these remarks may appear trite but we refer the reader to b i

 methods of the physical sciences b v 

ralisations and sets experiment to work by suggesting 
modes of action analogous to what obtains in similar cases 
it can hardly fail to promote the purposes of science by 
bringing to light many facts which would have lain concealed 
were it not for the presumed proximate causes or ana 
logies it had pointed out the undulatory theory of light 
is one of the most favourable instances of hypotheses of this 
character considering the manner in which this theory 
ascribed the transmission of light to the vibratory motions of 
an elastic ether dr young was led to infer from an analogous 
property of the transmission of sound through a similar 
medium the beautiful law already adverted to of the inter 
ference of the rays of light but it is not to be lost sight of 
notwithstanding this theory very plausibly accounts for all 
the known properties of light and might consequently be 
supposed should it not prove an actual statement of the 
proximate causes of optical phenomena to be in some manner 
connected with them or at least to run so close a parallel 
with them as to admit of some expression common to both 
that the newtonian theory which sets out from an opposite 
point of view is capable of rendering a no less rational 
account of all the facts embraced by the same science if we 
admit the very reasonable supposition advanced by m biot 
of a rotatory motion of the particles of light about their axes 
these apparent agreements and clashing discrepancies ought 
to make us extremely chary in placing any strong reliance on 
theories and refuse to regard any hypothesis as legitimate 
at least where a cause is to be investigated unless the cause 
assigned be already known to produce the effect in question 
in which case the supposition will be limited to the precise 
mode of the dependence or in other words to the exact 
law according to which the effect varies with variations in the 
quantity of or in relation to the cause 

it may happen indeed that the supposition do not relate 
to causation but only to the law of correspondence between 
facts which being effects of one common cause accompany 
each other in a certain fixed proportion but as the laws of 
such variations are always open to precise measurements 
there is no difficulty in bringing any hypothesis concerning 
them to the touchstone of facts and thus pronouncing on 
their reality it was known for example that the direction 



c i hypotheses whebe inapplicable 

of the line of refraction varied in a certain proportion with 
that of incidence but the different false hypotheses by 
which kepler sought to discover the law of the variation 
were cast aside as soon as they were brought to the test of 
measurement and none subsequently framed stood its ground 
for the same reason until willebrod snell pointed out the 
angular proportion of the two rays and m fresnil showed 
the law together with that of the deviation of the extraordi 
nary refracted ray were necessary inferences from higher 
generalisations of an indisputable character 

we need hardly say that it is indispensable to the two con 
ditions already enumerated for transforming hypotheses into 
correct exponents of general laws that they coincide with all 
the observed facts and inductions previously known which 
those laws include hence the comparison of the inferences 
to which they deductively lead with the mass of established 
truths which every important theory embraces is one of 
the most secure means of their verification when the 
cause assigned by an hypothesis is already known to produce 
similar effects to those attributed to it and is found to agree 
with all the facts included in its generalisation it can hardly 
fail to be true especially if the previous inductions arrived at 
be of a very diverse character in such case the hypothesis 
will rest on the method of agreement and the number of in 
ductive inferences which it meets will therefore be required 
to spring from such different quarters as to place it beyond 
doubt that any hypothesis bearing the character of a vera 
causa could fit them without being the actual agent in ques 
tion 

hypotheses however are not available in all subjects in 
many the general principle to be reached can only be gained 
by ascending inductively from the minor to the more general 
laws which it includes which ascent is not without its ad 
vantage in enabling us to perceive how laws which we had 
previously regarded as unconnected become particular cases 
either one of the other or each of one still more general and 
at length blend all together in the general principle which 
is the object of our search if chemistry ever pass the limits 
of an experimental science we fear it can only be by a process 
analogous to this the proximate generalisations in which 
its complex laws are now commencing to resolve themselves 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

are so unlike any agents which we could have suggested a 
priori as to make the use of hypothesis on any large scale in 
this science visionary in the extreme where the principles 
of a science are peculiar to itself and exhibit no analogous 
laws or facts to other sciences whose agents are more 
thoroughly understood the condition of hypothesis is despe 
rate we have no choice hut to proceed in tardy gradation 
and toilsome ascent from law to law until we trace out a 
general principle that will allow ratiocination its deductive 
range 

it must in fine be noted that in all cases of reasoning 
from general theories whether obtained by the inductive or 
hypothetical process every step of the ratiocination must be 
verified if possible by an appeal to facts since even should 
the theory prove true an error committed in pursuing it into 
detail would of course lead to wrong inferences and inva 
lidate the general statement in which it was expressed an 
apposite illustration of the necessity of this step is to be found 
in newtons theory of sound which although accounting 
correctly for the general principle and leading to a numerical 
conclusion for the actual velocity of sound which agreed in 
general respects with reality yet was found defective in an 
essential point when lagrange looked more closely at the 
facts owing to one or two important considerations being 
overlooked by his predecessor in pursuing the subject into its 
minor details hence it is indispensable to the secure com 
pletion of the deductive inferential process that all the de 
tails to which it leads should be verified by an extensive com 
parison with observed facts 

 empirical generalisations theory of probability 
and analogical evidence 

so far we have considered the methods by which concealed 
laws or universal propositions admitting of no exceptions 
are hunted out and demonstrated but in addition to the 
positive truths of which natural philosophy is constituted 
there are a large class of irregular occurrences in nature that 
depend on causes so variable and uncertain as to incapacitate 
science either from pronouncing on their anterior conditions 
or predicting their return in any determinate instance these 



c i use of probable genebalisatioits 

it is necessary to invest with as much scientific certainty as 
the case admits of though we cannot reclaim them entirely 
from the dominion of doubt we may nevertheless ascertain 
the precise extent to which they are to be trusted and in 
many instances raise important conclusions from them of a 
practical nature 

the most favourable of these cases meet us in the shape 
of phenomena whose concomitant occurrence is so frequent 
as to warrant the inference of some antecedent connexion 
between them without affording us any secure ground for 
affirming the manner of its existence thus the fact that most 
darkeyed persons have dark hair that most swedes have light 
complexions that most stratified formations contain fossils 
that most mineral springs possess salt and other coincidences 
of a similar character being the effects of latent conditions 
which are liable to be marred in particular cases by uncertain 
laws do not present any ground on which science can erect 
a proposition of more than probable universality the time 
may arrive when the condition both of their occurrence and 
failure in every known case will be traced to the action of 
laws of a distinctive character at least the present advance 
of science is raising many similar coincidences out of the 
category of empirical generalisations to the rank of scientific 
truths but as fast as science proceeds in this direction it 
brings to light other coincidences of like nature so that it is 
never likely the philosopher will lack occasion to apply them 
in evidence or that cases will not continue to occur in which 
they alone will constitute the only landmarks by which he 
can guide his way 

now it is obvious that until the conditions on which sucli 
coincidences depend are in whole or part laid bare that we 
can place no further reliance on them than simple experience 
warrants if we have observed that nine swedes out of every 
ten have light complexions the probability that the next 
swede we meet will possess that feature will of course 
be in the same proportion there are however some em 
pirical generalisations whose anterior conditions are in 
some degree known and whose truth therefore admits of 
prediction from another source tor example it may be 
ascertained that most prussians are arithmeticians not only 
from personal observation and the reports of travellers but 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

also from the fact of government schools existing in that 
country to which every parent is obliged to send its offspring 
for a certain period and in which the science of number is 
taught the approximation to universality may consequently 
be easily calculated without depending on a single result of 
experience by allowing for the casualties of sickness and 
incapacity within reasonable limits of error where the 
marks of the individual coincidence are latent as in the latter 
case we can sometimes ascertain whether the particular in 
stance of the generalisation is included under it by other 
marks which lead to its recognition thus were it required 
to be known that a particular witness in any case was an 
instance of the empirical proposition that most men speak 
truth we need only ascertain his general character and the 
bearings of his testimony on his own interest to make up 
our minds with sufficient certainty on the subject 

where the coincidence however is so rare as to create 
doubt as to its dependence on any recognised law or to 
lead us to attribute its origin to mere casualty notwith 
standing a similar rule holds it is necessary here to point 
out some particular cases of its application suppose for 
example the object of inquiry be the connexion of rain 
with a particular wind it is not sufficient to observe 
the number of times this phenomenon occurs with one 
wind more than another but we must also take into 
account the relative proportion of periods in which the other 
winds blow if a west wind blows twice as often annually as 
an easterly wind which is the case in england we have no rea 
son to infer that rain coexists with the former wind through 
some law common to both which does not obtain in the latter 
simply because it rains twice as often with the first wind 
as with the last but if it rain more than twice as often 
we may conclude that there is some cause in nature tending 
to produce both rain and a westerly wind or that a westerly 
wind has itself some tendency to produce rain but should 
it rain less than twice as often we may draw for the contrary 
reason a directly opposite inference hence if we pursue 
the inference which points to some kind of connexion be 
tween a particular wind and rain we generally find the cause 
to lie in the nature of the earths surface over which the 
wind passes those which have a long tract of water to sweep 



c i casual agents how eliminated 

over as the southwesterly being generally accompanied 
with wet while easterly winds are dry on account of the 
arid continents which prevail in that direction but as we do 
not know how far these causes affect the phenomena in ques 
tion or how much they are assisted or marred by other 
causes unless by experience the coincidences they exhibit 
can only be regarded in the light of an empirical law and 
their effects predicted within a proximate degree of exactness 
by the method already given 

the largest number of empirical generalisations embrace 
those phenomena which are conjointly the result of law and 
casualty or in which the effects of casual conjunctions of 
causes are habitually blended with the affects of a constant 
cause to ascertain the precise effect that ought to be 
ascribed to the cause invariably acting as it is impossible to 
proceed according to the ordinary method of eliminating 
the action of the inconstant agents our only resource 
is to observe the variations which arise from their combina 
tion with the constant cause and strike an average of the 
mean result should the trials prove sufficiently numerous 
as to include all the various states in which the capricious 
causes enter into combination with the invariable one any 
further repetition of the experiments will only exhibit the 
same fluctuations reducible to the same fixed average so 
that we cannot go astray if we assign the mean point at 
tending all the sets of experiments to the presence of the 
constant agent alone capable of producing it while we attri 
bute the oscillations about it to the casual influences which 
modify its action for example the state of the barometer 
at any particular period depends upon the airs gravity 
which is liable to be modified by a multitude of capricious 
agencies such as clouds rarefaction evaporation and the 
like but if the fluctuations of the quicksilver be regularly 
noted they will be found to be reduced to a small number 
periodic in their occurrence and constantly oscillating about 
a certain fixed point the conclusion consequently is irre 
sistible that the mean height is to be attributed to the 
ordinary gravity of the atmosphere and the periodic fluctua 
tions to the daily interference of some constant agent with 
ita natural density which on examination proved to be the 
rarefaction of the air occasioned by the increase of tern 



 methods of the physical sciences b v 

perature as the day advances the inconstant fluctuations 
were then set down to the inconstant agents which pro 
duced them it is by such observations we are enabled to 
ascertain the suns medium heat at any point of the earths 
surface and the exact level of the sea on any particular 
coast or the height at which the water of the ocean would 
stand if undisturbed by winds waves or tides we also 
afford an example of the same method when we repeat an 
experiment in order to escape the unavoidable errors of each 
individual experiment by taking the mean of the different 
results 

from the discovery of the cause of the periodic fluctua 
tions in the barometer it will be seen that when we are not 
aware of the presence of a constant cause in the anterior 
conditions of the effect it may be discovered by striking a 
similar average of the mean result for in that case if the 
effects of the different causes do not cancel each other but 
continually oscillate about a certain fixed point we may infer 
the presence of an invariable antecedent among the anterior 
conditions and detect that agent by some of the scientific me 
thods already treated of in this manner loaded dice may be 
discovered for if after a sufficient number of throws we do 
not find the average of the particular results to balance each 
other but exhibit a preponderance in favour of some particular 
throw we may infallibly infer that some constant cause is act 
ing in favour of that particular throw and the precise amount 
of its influence hence we may conclude with the same de 
gree of assurance an invariable agent to be absent among 
the anterior conditions when the average result is zero and 
attribute each individual instance of the effect to pure 
casualty but in these cases it remains to be determined 
firstly considering the average results of the coincidences of 
a sufficient number of trials or the anterior cases possible 
what is the amount of probability with which a particular 
instance may be inferred and secondly with what amount 
of probability in the case of several causes to explain a 
given effect but of the presence of which in this particular 
case nothing is known may this effect be assigned to any 
one of these causes 

the principles on which these problems depend for solu 
tion are laid down in a refined branch of mathematical 



c i doctbne of peobability 

inquiry called the doctrine of probabilities and may thus be 
summarily stated the probability in favour of the occur 
rence of any particular instance out of the antecedent pos 
sibility of a multitude of others is in the ratio between the 
number of cases in which the event occurs and the sum of 
all the cases including those in which the event occurs and 
those in which it does not occur or when the anterior con 
ditions are known to be equally possible in the ratio which 
the entire number bears to the single condition thus in 
play at cross and pile the probability of cross is one half 
because it is found on an average that cross is thrown about 
once in every two throws whereas in the cast of a die the 
probability of ace is onesixth because in every hundred 
throws ace will be found to comprise onesixth of the 
number secondly the probability that the effect was pro 
duced by any one of the unknown causes which might have 
been in operation is in the ratio of the probability of the 
cause multiplied by the probability that the cause if it 
existed would have produced the effect suppose for example 
that a woman was found drowned in low water if the spot 
lay on any part of the seacoast three possible causes suggest 
themselves as the only agents by which the circumstance 
could be produced first the person slipping off the beach 
in a state of stupor or intoxication and not having sufficient 
selfcontrol to recover herself or falling in while the tide 
was sufficiently high to drown her secondly the being 
drowned at sea and subsequently cast ashore thirdly an 
act of violence by which she was detained under water until 
suffocated now if the woman was seen a few hours pre 
vious perfectly rational proceeding during the ebb of the 
tide in the company of a man in the direction of the locality 
where her body was discovered and if a shriek was heard 
shortly afterwards in the neighbourhood whence they had 
proceeded if in addition it could be proved that the man 
had been recently engaged in violent altercations with the 
woman in question a strong case of probability almost 
amounting to circumstantial evidence would be made out in 
favour of the cause last mentioned the second cause would 
be put out of court the only doubt left in the case being that 
created by the first supposition that she had strayed some 
distance from her attendant and having fallen into the sea

 methods of the physical sciences b v 

during a fit perished before he could reach her a supposi 
tion which remaining circumstances taken into account is 
hardly appreciable when compared with the culminating pro 
babilities on the other side of the question 

in the first case the causes to which the effect could be 
attributed were neither equally likely to have existed nor 
equally certain to produce the effect had the woman been 
attacked with epilepsy for the first time in her life the pro 
bability that the fit would have thrown her on the beach is 
much stronger than it should have caused her to be immersed 
in the sea and even in the latter case the probability that 
she should have been drowned before her companion reached 
her is fainter still the first cause therefore is made up of 
a series of very faint probabilities which weaken each other 
in multiplied proportion while the last cause admits only 
of one probability and that when blended with the adjacent 
circumstances of a very strong character 

there are two other cases of the second theorem of very 
common application in judicial and scientific inquiry viz 
where the supposed possible causes though equally certain to 
produce the given effect are not equally certain to have existed 
in the case in question and where their existence is equally 
certain without being under the circumstances equally likely 
to have produced the effect but in these cases the proba 
bility in favour of any one cause will of course only lie in the 
ratio of their unequal probabilities thus if one cause existed 
twice as often in nature as another that is occurred two hun 
dred times where the other has only existed one hundred and 
that one or the other must have existed where a certain effect 
has been produced the probability in favour of the more fre 
quent cause being the agent in question would be in the ratio 
of two to one which is the ratio of their antecedent proba 
bilities suppose on the other hand that the causes though 
equally frequent are not equally likely to have operated in 
one particular case that for example out of three times 
that one cause occurs it produces the effect twice for the 

 it may be in the recollection of the reader that the probabilities on 
the side of the last cause were so culminating as to lead the jury to 
convict mr kirwan whose case is here summarily stated but that the 
extreme penalty of the law was subsequently commuted on account of 
the slight element of doubt that still remained in favour of the first 
supposition 



c i analogical evidence 

others once it is obvious that the antecedent probability in 
favour of the more frequent cause will be as before in the 
ratio of two to one the third case is but a compound of 
these two where the unequal probabilities of each set of 
causes are multiplied or compounded together and the 
balance struck in favour of the greatest probability 

another class of inferences which lie equally out of the 
range of direct scientific methods and rest to a great extent 
on probable evidence are those which we draw concerning 
the state of nature in circumstances times and localities to 
which our observations have not extended either through 
the durability which nature manifests throughout all her 
works or from her tendency to bring about similar effects by 
similar agencies and to work out her ends by designs which 
leave no arrangement half completed or void of the object 
it was intended to meet for example from the fact that 
the sea has gained one hundred yards on the sussex coast 
within the last century and a half l we conclude that it will 
continue to advance in the same proportion in succeeding 
years again because day and night on our globe depend on 
the periodical passage of the spectator into and out of the 
earths shadow consequent on the earths rotation and the 
illuminating property of the sun we conclude the same phe 
nomenon occurs with the other planets which also revolve 
on their axes and possess the suns light in similar degree 
in like manner because the earth has never swerved out of 
its orbit or exhibited any oscillations in its course destructive 
of its present internal economy since the memory of man 
we find no difficulty in believing it will continue to preserve 
the same beautiful order throughout all coming time it is 
also no uncommon thing to draw analogies between the con 
dition of other planets and this earth with a view to obtain 
evidence of the nature of their inhabitants and their internal 
structure 

now each of these and similar cases of inference are to 
be received with different degrees of probability according 
to the amount of evidence in each case and the limits 
of time and space to which each inference extends it 
is obvious that with regard to the succession of day and 

 the town of brighton of elizabeths era is now deep enough 
under the waves and the erosion of the sea on the adjacent cliffa is 
noticeable every year

night in the remaining planets of the solar system the sup 
position is of the strongest character bordering in fact on a 
complete induction but if we extend it to other spheres 
which revolve on their axes the inference descends lower in 
the scale of probability since we are not certain on account of 
their absence from our system that their rotatory motion may 
be accompanied with the illuminating properties of another 
sun so related to them as to cause the phenomenon in question 
again it is an inference resting upon the strongest grounds 
that the sun will rise tomorrow and the earth continue its 
usual daily round for both have continued to do so for the 
last five thousand years and we know the laws on which 
these occurrences depend have not exhibited the slightest 
degree of deterioration in the interval the supposition 
therefore that these agencies will be counteracted tomorrow 
by some cause the effects of which have not appeared for five 
thousand years and whose approach we have not the slightest 
grounds to anticipate so far transcends human conception 
as to be considered an impossibility the effects of no cause 
that science can take into account which had not been per 
ceptible for five thousand years could in one night grow up 
to such startling magnitude as to become overwhelming 
but if we extend the inference from tomorrow to this day 
ten thousand years the inference loses its conclusive value 
for there is nothing which is not perfectly consonant with 
our idea of causes to hinder the belief that a cause which for 
five thousand years had produced no sensible effect might 
produce a very considerable one at the end of ten thousand 
in the inference from analogy the strength of the proba 
bility will depend upon the extent of ascertained resemblance 
both compared with the amount of ascertained difference and 
taken in connexion with the extent of the unexplored region 
of unknownproperties thus in ascertaining the amount of 
probability in favour of the moon being inhabited we must 
not only take into account the general points of resemblance 
between it and the earth in its being a solid opaque and 
nearly spherical body containing active volcanoes and re 
ceiving heat and light from the sun in about the same quantity 
as the earth and revolving on its axis but we must consider 
its comparatively smaller dimensions and the differences it 
exhibits in having its surface more unequal and apparently 
volcanic throughout in having no atmosphere sufficient to re 



c ii stjevet of the moeal sciences 

fract light no clouds and therefore inferentially no water and 
strike the balance according as the resemblances or differences 
predominate which bear upon the subject for decision if 
mere point of similarity between the moons and the earths 
internal economy were in question it is obvious according 
to the above observations the probabilities would about 
balance each other but when we consider that some of the 
discrepancies in the moon refer to those objects which are 
found indispensable to animal life on our globe we must 
conclude that if inhabitants do exist in the moon the 
conditions on which their life depends differ considerably 
from those which obtain on the earth there are however 
other bodies in the solar system between which and the 
earth there is a much closer resemblance which possess an 
atmosphere clouds and water and which exhibit strong 
indications of snow in the polar regions while as the ascer 
tained differences only refer to their average light and heat 
their velocity of rotation and intensity of gravity and similar 
unimportant circumstances the argument of analogy pre 
sents a striking preponderance on the side of an internal 
disposition of parts analogous to the earth and in favour of 
their being similarly inhabited nevertheless when we con 
sider the immense distance of these planets and contrast the 
infinite number of properties they possess of which we are 
entirely ignorant with the few we know we must confess this 
probability dwindles down to an almost inconceivable value

 nature of the moral sciences in what respect their 

methods differ from the physical 

we intend to devote this chapter to a succinct analysis of 
those methods by which truths are reached appertaining to 
the social mental and spiritual constitution of man in con 
tradistinction to those which belong to the physical world 
the subjects of these methods not only differ from those 
comprised in the last chapter by the whole diameter of mind 
and matter but are hardly at less variance with each other 
the two great branches of the spiritual sciences theology 
and ethics being exclusively founded on revealed truths and 



g methods of the moral sciences b v 

the universal principles of the natural law are directly 
amenable to the geometrical or abstract deductive method 
which from a few aphorisms or salient propositions deduces 
the complexity of truths of which those sciences consist 
while sociology comprises a group of sciences depending for 
the most part on the action of men on circumstances and 
the action of circumstances on men the laws of which can 
by no means be learned a priori but must be gleaned from an 
accurate examination of the past and referred as a kind of 
axiomata media to the higher principles of human nature 
hence the methods of this division of the subject referring 
to past sequences between successive stages of phenomena 
are very closely allied to those of physical inquiry while 
those like theology and ethics appertaining to inferences 
from laws already discovered which admit of no modifying 
or neutralising forces but demand ubiquitous enforcement 
are open at once to the sweeping range of direct deduction 
in its most obvious and least intricate form such sciences 
do not comprise relations between successive phenomena 
but mere interpretations of universal formulas to meet 
every variety of case which the intellect may devise for their 
application 

mental science or psychology is another department of 
this division the laws of whose sequential phenomena for 
the most part are also to be gleaned from experience but 
whose coexisting principles are obtained by a deep analysis 
of the individual consciousness and educed by deductive se 
quence out of the primordial elements of the human mind the 
former branch of psychology is connected as an art with edu 
cation the latter with the inferential process which true to 
its a priori character was matured as soon as the human 
intellect began to exercise the reflex principle while educa 
tion depending on experience is daily adding to its past 
results this science consequently is open to receive the 
double aids of the experimental and abstract deductive 
methods though little has yet been done however much 
may have been attempted to harmonise the truths collected 
from these two sources 

legislation which belongs to the sociological branch is not 
amenable to the corresponding method its leading principles 

 by aristotle dugald stewarts philosophy of the human 

mind is the leading work of this character 



c h connexion of the moeal sciences 

being deduced from the highest ethical laws or rather being 
so many practical inferences from those laws to suit the 
various occasions which arise for their application in civil 
society as such they are strictly amenable to the abstract 
deductive method and were in fact so intended to be 
treated by lord bacon in the heads of his fountains of 
equity 

these sciences so apparently diverse have a close affi 
nity to each other ethics with psychology forming by their 
conjunction the science of human nature may be said to 
stand in the same relation to the sociological sciences as 
mechanics to astronomy they comprise the simple law of 
which the latter sciences only afford the concrete exemplifi 
cation in all the diversity of circumstances in which human 
nature has been placed the highest results of the socio 
logical sciences are therefore only automata media or laws 
derived from the fundamental principles of ethics and psy 
chology and when unresolved into them must be regarded as 
so many unverified and consequently empirical generalisa 
tions legislation is only a similar offshoot of the natural 
law and since human nature which includes the whole is 
but a direct emanation from the deity theology may be 
said to be the fountain or parent source of the rest 

while however there exist this close relationship between 
the several groups of these sciences they present by no means 
a state of finish proportionate to their rank nor until the lead 
ing branches are in a more forward state can we anticipate 
any large development of the laws of the complex phenomena 
to which they lead while the science of mechanics was in 
its infancy astronomy which presents only a concrete exem 
plification of its laws could not propound a single generali 
sation to be depended upon with any degree of assurance 
and while the laws of mind are for the most part obscure or 
uncertain we cannot rely upon any axiom that sociology may 
furnish beyond the instances in which its truth has been 
observed the moral sciences instead of being developed 
according to their rank in the scale owe their expansion 
more or less to the extent of the a priori element in them 
those depending on experience being the slowest in pro

gress and the most tardy of appearance while ethics have 
reached a high degree of perfection the laws of mind are a 
blank while legislation has emulated ethics in extent of re 
finement the science of social progress has hardly burst from 
its shell 

combined with the disadvantages produced through the 
absence of proportionate development between the higher 
and lower groups of the moral sciences there arises the 
startling anomaly of the widest diversity of opinion between 
large masses of men even with regard to the fundamental 
axioms and derivative principles of those which are in then 
more advanced stage in physics this is never the case with 
sciences that have advanced beyond the empirical stage in 
astronomy indeed there are a few temerous enough to con 
front the newtonian mechanics but with the generality of 
civilised communities the principia is taken as a correct 
exponent of the truths it endeavours to demonstrate and 
this to so universal an extent that the philosopher who rises 
to impugn them succeeds in nothing but the demonstration 
of his folly with theology and ethics and even poli 
tical economy one of the sociological branches the case is 
far otherwise every person thinks himself at liberty to 
propound what opinions he chooses concerning these sub 
jects and unless he belong to a certain school whose tenets 
on the leading points he accepts as irrefragable every new 
writer generally sets out with the cartesian principle of 
pulling down whatever has been previously erected and 
clearing the ground for a new structure upon foundations 
for the most part at variance with those assumed by his pre 
decessors if his labours are characterised by systematic 
thought and bold flights of genius he also succeeds in esta 
blishing a school and instead of advancing the science upon 
which his mind has been concentrated one step onward he 

 the censure in the text only applies to those who admit the reality 
of celestial phenomena as implied both in the ptolemaic and coperni 
can systems while they ignore the superstructure which has been 
raised upon them by newton and his successors of course with re 
spect to those who like bishop berkeley and the present cardinal 
archbishop of lyons deny or throw doubt on the reality of the new 
tonian premises on purely metaphysical grounds the author ventures 
no reproof though he respectfully adduces the reasoning in b v c iv 
 as a complete answer to what has been advanced on this side of the 
subject 



c ii difficulties of the subject 

has only increased the diversity of lights in which the same 
subject may be viewed this divergence of opinion between 
men of eminently scientific character upon moral subjects has 
introduced among the unlearned classes of society the same 
fluctuating and conflicting views and led them to consider 
moral topics as much open to their lucubrations as the most 
inferior subjects upon which their minds can be employed 
a man who would deem his ignorant neighbour mad were 
he to speculate in sober earnest on the higher principles of 
acoustics or thermology without knowing anything about 
their elementary properties pays him the greatest atten 
tion when he chooses to discourse on the highest functions 
of government or ventures to propound the principles by 
which churches and empires should be governed on every 
subject respecting man religion and society conceit of 
knowledge still reigns without the reality and if socrates 
were in this age to descend into our marketplaces he would 
encounter the same dogmatic assurance as in his own 

such clashing variety of opinion upon the most elementary 
principles of the different moral sciences at once arises out of 
and is daily increased by the obscure character of psycholo 
gical laws and the capricious action of human volition phy 
sical laws may often be obscure but their effects admit of 
certain calculation and the order of sequence being constant 
and inevitable when once discovered enables us not only to 
predict the future in any given instance but also to recon 
struct the past astronomy for instance will afford us data 
for calculating the precise conditions of the heavenly bodies 
at any distant epoch already elapsed or in the womb of 
futurity and that to so great an extent that even were all 
the astronomical archives burnt they could be completely re 
placed and the past history of the heavens entirely supplied by 
the observation of the present but with moral phenomena 
the case is otherwise here the chief motive power is mind 
and we are not only ignorant of the laws through which it mani 
fests its agency but the order of its production is so irregular 
that we can never reckon upon the precise quality or degree 
of its action were psychological laws discovered at least in 
sufficient abundance to verify many inductive generalisations 
in sociological science still there arises the question in ex 
tending those laws to future cases of the exact force in which 
they will act now on this very hinge turns the fate of man

and the destinies of nations no psychological revelations 
that man can expect to discover could have predicted the 
advent of those minds who have established religions over 
thrown empires founded dynasties pulled down altars or 
reformed creeds this class of minds are distributed over 
the masses of generations by no presumable law that we can 
discover but in the most anomalous and confused manner 
occasionally their appearance is separated by centuries 
sometimes by gaps of years now they come in clusters and 
then they stand alone but whenever they appear revolu 
tion of language and manners creation and overset of insti 
tutions follow conjoined states are erected into new nations 
and distinct empires fused down into one hence were the 
laws of mind known and the phenomena it manifests as sub 
ject to the regular action of causation as the creatures of the 
material universe yet the uncertainty alone of the quality 
of the agent would render any calculation founded upon them 
for any distance of time chimerical in the extreme 

although it is a principle of our nature to assign to every 
thing an efficient cause yet so difficult is the task in moral 
inquiries of tracing any proportion between the apparent force 
of any moral causes we may select and their known operation 
that we are often obliged to deliver up that operation to chance 
or more rationally to the irresistible hand of the great dis 
poser the death of a man at a critical juncture his disgust 
his retreat his disgrace have brought innumerable calami 
ties on a whole nation a common soldier a child a girl at 
the door of an inn have changed the face of fortune and 
almost of nature the effects to which such slight incidents 
led may indeed be traced through the intervening series of 
eventualities which generated the result but these are of so 
casual and multifarious a character and so much depend at 
every link upon the determining agency of the will that to 
attempt to found upon them any conclusion of a scientific na 
ture either for future guidance or present application would 
be a waste of thought such cases are never likely to happen 
again and even were their occurrence possible no power 
short of omniscience could enable us to grasp all the condi 
tions upon which each step of the sequence would eventually 
depend and forecast the result the will which is the deciding 
agent in such circumstances is no doubt strongly influenced 
by motives if not completely governed by them but we have 



c ii operation of prejudice 

no power to calculate its action in a single individual under 
any trying circumstances much less in cases where a thousand 
volitions are concerned the rules of causation may hold 
at least to an extent sufficient for the application of scientific 
methods but we lack the power to get at the conditions upon 
which the effect depends the task of diving into the human 
breast and tracing the crowd of agencies which are control 
ling each volition is even too great for its owner who is often 
uncertain enough of the issue but the insuperable difficulties 
which hinder an external observer from grasping the same 
conditions become multiplied in infinitesimal proportion 

even in subjects which have no relation to sequence as 
theology and ethics the irregular agency of the will is mani 
fested in interfering with the inferential process and leading 
the mind to modify or oppose conclusions which are at war 
with its tendencies such speculations not being of a tan 
gible nature cannot be brought to any other test than that 
of pure reason and since it is the fate of great talents to be 
almost invariably accompanied with deep sensibilities it oc 
casionally happens that the strongest reason obeys the be 
hests of some more predominating passion in dethroning the 
true system and setting up a more convenient but a false 
system in its place the absence of close compact inference 
is easily supplied by ingenious sophisms and brilliant rhetoric 
feeling and interest is listed on the side of argument and 
with the majority conviction is the result when the tenets 
established by such a method became fostered in subsequent 
ages by the associations of infancy and kindred it is no 
marvel they should thrive and flourish so as to perpetuate 
among the generations of vast communities the opinions to 
which they gave rise it is to such influences combined 
with the action of the imaginative feelings which these sub 
jects very largely call into operation that conflicting 
views on the more purely spiritual sciences are to be traced 
it is simply because this class of the abstract sciences can 
only be built up by pure reason that the generality of men 
who allow prejudice and imagination to interfere with the in 
ferential process in them are least able to decide between 
the rival claimants of orthodoxy could we indeed shut out 
human volition and the action of disturbing fancies mankind 
would no more differ about the conclusions to be drawn from 
the primary elements of theology and ethics than with the de

ductions from geometrical postulates and definitions were 
prejudice and feeling on the other hand let in upon the 
mathematical branch of these sciences were it any ones 
interest to impugn some of the derivative principles of the 
calculus of variations or did the overthrow of any proposi 
tions of the higher geometry strongly administer to any 
partys gratifications the world would not be long without a 
new system of conic sections and a fresh doctrine of limits 

yet we are not to relinquish on account of these disturb 
ing influences and great obstacles the erection of an impos 
ing group of moral sciences on grounds quite as solid as those 
which refer to the material world notwithstanding the socio 
logical portion may not give us the same power to predict oc 
currences without a cloud of conditions they will help us to 
many generalisations of practical importance and theoretic 
value affording a guide to the statesman in the control of 
communities and throwing light in the eyes of the philo 
sopher on the ultimate laws of human nature upon such 
generalisations provided they arise from a wide induction of 
historical phenomena and enable us to account deductively 
for any past occurrences to which they are capable of being 
applied no cavil or doubt can arise they can be brought 
to the touchstone of fact and men cannot call in question 
what they see while with regard to those subjects which 
admit of no such verification but simply concern complex in 
ferences from a priori data we must rely on the variety of 
proof that correct reason is capable of receiving and the in 
consistencies which are the never failing attendants of erro 
neous inference for securing their derivative principles from 
error 

 the sciences amenable to the abstract deductive method

negative process examples of scientific praxis 

the moral sciences may be divided into two large groups 
viz those which consist of inferences drawn from a priori 
resources and others which in conjunction with many 
branches of such inferences are raised out of generalisations 
drawn from an extensive examination of the past the last 
group refers to coincidences between the order of successionor 
to the laws by which one state of phenomena generate another 



c ii principles of ethics 

and is coextensive with the sociological branch while the 
first comprises the conclusions our reason obliges us to infer 
from general principles either coexisting within or deli 
vered to us from external authority in which case the sphere 
of inference will extend over the ground from which we are 
led to infer the existence of such indubitable authority and 
the fact that the revelations we receive come entirely from its 
hands the proof however is a priori and deductive even 
throughout those links of it which deal with sequence be 
tween a certain order of facts depending not on the causal 
tie between the facts themselves but solely on the relation 
which these bear or the point of view in which they may be 
considered to the external authority or to the coexisting 
principles whether natural or revealed which are said to 
have emanated from it now such relation being decided 
by the rational principles of the intellect the proof at this 
stage of the process is no less abstractedly deductive than 
when the legitimacy of the general propositions having been 
made out we are only concerning ourselves with drawing 
inferences from them 

the sciences which compose this group are evidently theo 
logy ethics legislation and that portion of psychology whose 
laws may be completely learned by a study of the coexisting 
laws of the mental constitution without reference to the de 
pendence of one state of mind on another or the connexion 
between antecedent states and the present which of course 
involve generalisations from experience the elementary 
principles of each of these subjects may be regarded as so 
many definitions axioms and postulates from which the 
complete body of their respective truths are evolved by a 
process exactly identical with the geometrical method for 
example the primary data of ethics and legislation are 
certain irreversible and irrepressible convictions stamped on 
every breast by which each human creature is urged to fulfil 
the destiny of his being and preserve his faculties appetites 
and feelings which make up his individual constitution in 
that healthy state of action and subordination which will 
most conduce to his own happiness and the welfare of others 
such convictions as admonish us to do injury to no man to 
preserve our veracity to submit our passions to the control 
of reason and in general to abstain from actions which 
awake censure or shame all which principles are coexistent

with human nature and compose the spiritual instincts which 
enter into its constitution they comprise in one word the 
natural code by which in compliance with the mandate of 
the apostle every man is bound to govern himself some 
persons indeed may be found to deny the existence of such 
principles a priori and resolve them into the mere creatures 
of conventionalism just as there are persons who will deny 
the existence of matter or the commonest axioms of physical 
science but the generality of men in every position of life 
savage civilised or semibarbarous bear witness to the in 
digenous character of their origin now it is in the appli 
cation of these common principles to adjust the actions of 
man with relation to himself his creator and his species 
that ethics consists so far as the violation of such prin 
ciples either in their ultimate or derivative form interferes 
with the welfare of society it is the business of legislation 
to take cognisance of their influence but the process in 
either case is identical with the geometrical method when 
we examine any particular question that may arise with a 
view to establish a new derivative proposition we simply 
survey the relations which the case bears to the main prin 
ciples and the subordinate ones already deduced from them 
and cast up the result should a new theorem be demon 
strated the links of inference by which the previous pro 
positions led to its establishment are brought into systematic 
connexion and the new law takes its place in the series of 
constructed truths and performs its functions in the gene 
ration of others 

thus were it required to solve the ethical problem whether 
any action is formally indifferent it would be necessary to 
examine first in what good or evil consists and then con 
sider if there are any human actions which do not enter 
into either category but the first case is determined by 
the theorem previously established that an act is good or bad 
according as it accords or conflicts with the natural law the 
sole point then for investigation is whether any act can be 
realised without doing either now as a preliminary step 
to the decision we ought to distinguish everything which a

c ii the negative process 

human act includes that we may know in how many ways an 
act is capable of being viewed in connexion with the natural 
law first there is the material thing done with its attendant 
circumstances secondly the motive which incited the action 
as to the material object it is evident many acts do not come 
within the cognisance of the natural law if we walk or play 
an instrument abstracting from the purposes which urge us 
to do these things no good or evil can attach to the naked 
act itself but if either be executed with a good or bad pur 
port the law is directly applicable and will pronounce its 
sentence the question then is narrowed to the simple 
case whether any motive can be indifferent which is easily 
determined in the negative by the consideration that man is 
bound to direct all his actions in harmony with the fixed 
constitution of things and to do nothing through levity or 
without a rational motive a conclusion indeed which is 
doubly corroborated by the christian law which exacts an 
account of every idle word and action and requires its fol 
lowers to consecrate the intention of all their actions to the 
glory of the supreme being 

the establishment however of such propositions do not 
end with direct proof before they can be accepted as indu 
bitable truths it is necessary not only to demonstrate their 
certainty but to show that every other mode of looking at 
the question is illusory this which is called the negative 
process performs the same functions in moral evidence as 
mathematics do in the physical sciences at least as far as 
verification is concerned placing the demonstration beyond 
the shadow of doubt by the decided manner in which 
every objection is met and by investing the proposition 
with double proof viz the direct and the reductio per impos 
sibile which is so powerful in elementary geometry thus the 
proof of the intrinsic moral nature of mans actions arising 
out of the natural law is not only based on each ones indi 
vidual consciousness and the universal consent of mankind 
but it also rests on the fact that no other principle can be 
assigned which will account for it for if such exist it 
must be either the utility of society or the free election of 
providence or the manichean principle of two antagonistic 
deities the last supposition implying a contradiction is 
philosophically absurd the second is contrary to the attri

butes of qod and the third is inadequate to explain the 
keen perception of right and wrong which is found among 
isolated savages bound to each other by no links in the 
way of treaties and compacts hence all other possible 
cases being put out of court the understanding bounds back 
to the direct proof with a confidence equal to that with which 
it embraces the strongest demonstration of physical science 
ethics are connected with theology natural and revealed by 
the principle which insists upon the worship of thedeity a law 
that is as irrepressible and fundamental as any in its category 
natural theology however to silence the cavils of atheists 
proves the existence of the supreme being by the a priori 
argument that mechanism cannot exist without an artificer 
and that the evidence of design is on so stupendous a scale 
in the universe as to require a being of the grandest capacity 
to project it the demonstration of his infinite attributes 
follows from the necessity of his existence as the fountain of 
being and consists of many diverging lines of argument each 
strengthening one another and meeting in the same point 
the negative process is also employed to prove there is no 
assumption which accounts for the existence of the universe 
apart from the creator without landing its maintainers in 
startling contradictions thus every step in this link of the 
proof is purely deductive certain common principles being laid 
down which we are compelled by the intellectual laws of our 
nature to accept as the conditions of the worlds existence 
from which are reasoned out successively the existence of the 
deity and all the qualities with which his nature is endued 
the other branch of proof by which his revealed will is esta 
blished is similarly deductive it being assumed to be impos 
sible that rational men could bear witness to certain truths 
and miracles which they knew to be impositions or of which 
they were only half certain with no other prospect of reward 
for their pains than punishment and death this assumption 
rises out of the constitution of human nature the case which 
it involves is sufficiently evident from history there are 
moreover multiplied lines of inference corroborating the same 
point all of a strictly a priori kind such as the existence of 
god being proved the strong antecedent probability in favour 
of revelation and the consonance of the doctrines taught 
with the natural attributes of deity as soon as the funda 
mental tenets appertaining to revealed dogma are thus esta 



c ii example fbom paley 

wished the process of inference from them is quite of a 
similar character with the ethical deductions already de 
scribed and is amenable to the same verifications with 
respect to the moral branch of them or christian ethics thia 
confirmation partakes of a duplicate character for the 
moral doctrines of christ are in unison with the natural law 
and no inference from his teaching can be accepted which 
conflicts with any portion of that law either in its ultimate 
or in its derivative principles and every inference which 
cannot be shown to have a strict connexion with it must be 
received with doubt until resolved like a complex law into 
the higher principles of natural ethics and shown to be a 
particular exemplification of them 

of the former kind of argument an example may be ad 
duced from paley his thesis that the christian religion 
came from god is made to rest with respect to historic 
evidence on the premises that a religion attested by 
miracles is from god and that the christian religion is 
so attested the minor proposition about which only 
men are to cavil is proved by a syllogism in barbara ail 
miracles attested by such witnesses as we have named are 
worthy of credit the christian miracles are attested by such 
witnesses they are therefore worthy of credit the minor 
premiss of the latter syllogism is then divided into the seve 
ral propositions of which it consists each of which is esta 
blished separately in the first place it is proved that the 
witnesses had no prospect but suffering from the nature of 
the case because they were preachers of a religion unexpected 
and unwelcome to the jews and the gentiles that they 
actually suffered is proved from the testimony of the jewish 
heathen and christian writers and that they voluntarily ex 
posed themselves to suffering rests on the authority of the 
same writers in the second place it is proved that what they 
suffered for was a miraculous story by the nature of the case 
as they could have had nothing but miracles on which to rest 
the claims of the new religion by the allusions to miracles 

 it is remarked by dr whately that the minor of this syllogism 
was admitted while the major was denied by the pagans but as the 
case at present is reversed paleys argument goes to establish the 
minor premiss about which alone in these days there is likely to be 
any question logic appendix iii 

t 



 methods of the moeal sciences b t 

particularly to the resurrection both in christian and profane 
writers as the evidence on which the christian religion 
rested it is also shown by the same evidence that the 
miracles in attestation of which they suffered were such as 
they professed to have witnessed in the third place it is 
proved that the miracles thus attested are what we call the 
christian miracles by the nature of the case that it is im 
probable that a new fiction should have replaced the original 
story by the incidental allusions of ancient writers both 
christian and profane to accounts agreeing with those of 
the inspired writings by the credibility of the scriptures 
established by several distinct arguments each separately 
tending to show that these books were from the earliest 
ages of christianity well known and carefully preserved 
among christians again it is proved by similar premises 
that the early christians not only submitted to new rules of 
conduct but that they did so in consequence of their belief 
in miracles wrought before them 

the major premiss that miracles thus attested are worthy 
of credit paley next proceeds to establish first by the im 
probability that men who could have avoided all their suffer 
ings had they lived quietly should have provoked the knife 
of the executioner by pretending to have seen what they 
never saw that they should go about lying to teach virtue 
and persist with a full knowledge of christs imposture in 
propagating the frauds which met with such reprisals as the 
crucifixion and shed their blood in attestation of their reality 
secondly by the fact that no false story ever has been so at 
tested which is shown by adducing the several stories that 
can be produced as parallels to the christian and proving 
either that they are not so attested or that they are not pro 
perly miraculous hence the minor of the leading syllogism 
is fully made out and granting the major which has been full 
conceded since the pretensions of magic have been exploded 
viz that a religion attested by miracles is from grod the 
conclusion inevitably follows that the christian religion came 
from god 

to avoid unnecessary prolixity in the analysis of this argu 
ment we have left the obvious premiss in most of the syllo 
gisms unexpressed it not being needful in the analysis of any 
train of reasoning to express the implied premiss when 
wanted to reduce the syllogism to its strictly technical form 



c ii analysis of dedtjctiye seasoning 

with a view to detect a lurking fallacy tlie implied premiss is 
promptly suggested by the leading premiss and conclusion 
in following out a process of this kind it is necessary to begin 
with the last point established and tracing the reasoning 
backwards to examine on what grounds the inference is made 
the assertion will be the conclusion the grounds on which it 
rests the premises the premises must then be taken sepa 
rately and the grounds on which they rest examined accord 
ing to the plan we observed with the first conclusion a 
premiss must have been used as such either because it 
required no proof or because it had been proved in the 
former case it must either be selfevident or universally 
admitted or conceded by the opponents of the argument 
in the latter it must be regarded as a new conclusion de 
rived from other assertions which are premises to it which 
are to be examined in turn and if found correct treated as 
other conclusions derived from other assertions if the 
train of reasoning be correct the analysis will continue till 
the premises with which the whole commences are reached 
which of course should consist of assertions requiring no 
proof but if the chain be anywhere faulty some proposition 
will arise in the course of it either assumed as selfevident 
or incorrectly deduced from other assertions

the branch of psychological science which falls under the 
head of the abstract deductive method is the study of the 
structure of the intellectual constitution with a view to 
ascertain the laws through which the different faculties 
manifest their statical agency so far as the reasoning pro 
cess is concerned and the estimation of evidence in all its 
branches these laws have been pretty extensively de 
veloped in the organon of aristotle and the kritik of kant 
who may be taken as fair exponents of the methods by 
which their highest generalisations have been reached and 
the modes by which they are to be extended no reflection 
upon experience or analysis of scientific proof enabled the 
stagyrite to see the syllogism in the human mind and point 
out the nineteen different ways in which men may naturally 
reason he showed from the necessity of the case that 
every conclusion required two premises that the three pro 
positions concerned were only capable of a limited number 
of legitimate combinations that such combinations involved 
distinct qualities in the propositions themselves which arose 
out of the relation of the subject with the predicate and 
that the nature of the subject and the predicate implied the 
logical properties of terms the mode by which aristotle 
constructed in a few weeks the system which has employed 
and is destined to employ mens thoughts for decades of 
centuries was precisely identical to the method by which 
the early mathematicians ran up the splendid series of 
proofs which constitutes the lower geometry descartes in 
a similar manner established his methods and kant con 
nected the derivative laws of the old philosophy and the new 
with the ultimate principles of the intellect no attempt 
has been made to expound the laws of the imaginative faculty 
by seizing one or two of its elementary principles and making 
them the parent source of the rest yet there is the same 
mutual dependence between their functions as exist between 
those of the reasoning faculty and they only lack some genius 
rivalling aristotle in systematic and ratiocinative power to 
yield up similar results

 the laws which regulate successive states of mind 
the sociological sciences the concrete deductive method 
direct and inverse 

the remaining group of moral sciences concern the laws 
of sequence between phenomena whether individual or social 
in the former they regard the laws which generate particular 
mental states either with regard to the entire mind or only 
with reference to some of its dependencies for instance 
the law of association of ideas unfolds the series of relations 
existing between different classes of thoughts and feelings 
which make one suggestive of another as such this law is only 
one of the hundred operating agencies by which the mind is 
constantly modified and gradually urged from one state into 
another each of these single agencies work according to 
constant laws though their force varies in different persons 
thus it is a law of memory that a page is sooner committed 
by learning it by section alternately closing the book and 
looking at the passage only to catch the escaped word than 
to attempt to grasp the whole at once by keeping the eye 
continuously on the sheet yet the precise force with which 
the law operates is never found exactly the same in two 
persons the affections appetites feelings and passions 
have each also distinct principles of action as well as the 
intellect and though capable of being modified by many 
circumstances manifest invariably certain tendencies which 
are capable of being singly calculated within certain limits 
of error now besides the laws peculiar to themselves each 
of these phenomena have some properties in common for 
instance it is a law that the force by which each of these 
powers act increases in quick progression the power of its 
action so that if any one be indulged to the exclusion of the 
others that one is sure to predominate over the mind it is 
the study of these agents both singly and in unison with 
each other their peculiar together with their common pro 
perties the uses for which nature designed them and their 
effects both in ourselves and others that constitutes the 
science of human nature in its largest extent a study how 
ever which apart from writers of fiction seems not to have 
engrossed any portion of the attention of mankind we 
have no treatises on the passions or affections yet the special

treatment of each of these in the various points of view we 
have marked out is indispensable to a complete system of 
education and an accurate knowledge of the development of 
society 

it is obvious from the complex nature of the phenomena 
that we have no other mode of tracing the effects of the 
agents we have considered in any given case than by follow 
ing out their laws singly by comparing their relative strength 
by taking into consideration the circumstances concerned and 
forecasting the result deductively it is precisely a case 
of the composition of causes considered in the last chap 
ter where the result comprising a crowd of clashing and 
strengthening forces baffles every attempt to unravel the 
knot of effects and to assign to each its separate cause some 
of which are entirely neutralised in the action and others 
blended into one result the only obstacle to so complete a 
prediction of the result as would attend a similar investiga 
tion in mechanical philosophy is the uncertainty generated 
by the action of the will and the impossibility of estimating 
all the influences which may direct its action in any given 
case nor can we expect the progress of the science of 
human nature will ever place us in so favourable a condition 
all our data consequently must express tendencies not certain 
effects and notwithstanding the inferences built upon them 
will not warrant unconditional prediction in any case they will 
be of eminent importance as a guide to the knowledge both 
of any persons conduct under certain circumstances and of 
the special training required to produce certain habits of cha 
racter in some instances erroneous or incomplete data 
may lead us into wrong conclusions but these are not to be 
set down to the subjects unfitness to be invested with 
scientific formula but simply to wrong calculations we 
may rely upon the fact that causes are at work in instances 
which appear the most complex and casual and though com 
pounding their results acting according to invariable law 
whose effects were we in possession of all the data are 
capable of being computed a priori even throughout their 
most intricate combinations 

nor are the moral sciences alone in this uncertain predica 
ment there are elements in meteorology in the motions of 
fluid masses and the laws of the tides which must always 



c ii problem op ethology 

remain unfathomable and for which allowance must conse 
quently be made in the calculations which compute their 
effects in any given instance we know for example the 
great operating causes at work in the production of the tides 
and are able under certain conditions to compute their 
general effects even in unknown quarters of the globe but 
if precise accuracy be required the calculation wsl be of no 
avail in any single instance for there are causes of a local 
or casual nature such as the configuration of the bottom of 
the ocean the indentations of shores the direction and 
strength of the wind which it is impossible to foresee and 
which are always sure to interpose and in some single cases 
may altogether conspire to defeat the result in meteorology 
again the chief proximate operating causes and the laws 
which regulate their influences are so unknown that it is im 
possible to predict the order of antecedence and consequence 
between its phenomena with more than a very moderate de 
gree of probability yet no one doubts that tidology is a 
science and that meteorology is destined to become one or 
in other words that all the phenomena which these sciences 
embrace are not generated by special causes which act 
throughout all their combinations in accordance with in 
variable laws and that the general action of such causes is 
sufficiently cognisable to the human intellect to admit of 
being predicted within limits of time and space wide enough 
to leave a broad margin for the realisation of purposes of 
practical utility nothing further is claimed for the science 
of human nature and indeed hardly anything further is re 
quired if we are able to foretel from a general examination 
of any individual character what will be his conduct in any 
given emergency or what course of discipline will generate 
certain states of mind or what principles of action in the 
generality of instances are at work in the production of the 
varieties of habits tempers and characters we need no 
further theoretical knowledge to produce results of the 
greatest practicable importance to our species 

it is not through any belief that such knowledge is unat 
tainable that the present backwardness of this science is 
owing but chiefly to the unscientific methods by which men 
have sought to obtain it they have generalised from the 
smallest empirical data and rushed into the highest regions

of art before drawing out or having any definite conception 
of the propriety of the theory which the art involved 
having stumbled upon the agreement of certain states of 
mind with a certain anterior routine of practice they inquire 
no further but chain themselves down to the system which 
embodies the result this crude generalisation of passive 
experience is at the bottom of all our systems of civil of mili 
tary and ecclesiastical education and constitutes the prescient 
wisdom of those who are said to be observant of character 
and profoundly read in the world without any idea of the 
action of the individual laws at work or correct insight into 
the complex agencies which concur to the production of the 
effect they have the temerity to predict they consult the 
notebook of their former experience and decide according 
to the superficial aspects of the case this to draw an illus 
tration from a science whose methods are inevery respect 
analogical is precisely as if a man without any knowledge 
of the internal structure of the human body were to con 
struct a system of therapeutics or to predict simply from 
his past experience the effects of a certain medicine on any 
constitution of body if it is a universal complaint that the 
treatment of many disorders in the system is founded on 
mere empiricism the censure is doubly applicable to the 
efforts commonly made to regenerate human nature 

one of the first steps required to cpnstruct this science 
on its true foundation is the production of separate treatises 
on the different groups of homogeneous phenomena which 
enter into it as respects the action of their particular laws 
taken singly and in conjunction with others something of this 
kind bacon intended for the intellectual faculties in the little 
tract he wrote for sir henry saville the provost of eton 
but the treatise was limited solely to the improvement they 
are capable of receiving by due attention to psychology in a 
course of preliminary education an attempt which dugald 
stewart further followed out in his philosophy of the human 
mind the latter work however notwithstanding the learn 
ing and the attainments of the author from aiming at too 
much within its limited compass accomplished little had 
the two volumes in which the treatise is comprised merely 
examined the operations of one or two special faculties a step 
would have been made in the direction we point out upon 
the passions and feelings we have not even an attempt at 



c ii ethology where inductive 

distinct treatises the early fathers and a modern class of 
theologians in their disquisitions on practical morality have 
marked out many derivative laws which this class of mental 
phenomena manifest but entirely with a view to the acquire 
ment of certain habits of virtue and not to enlighten us on 
the general nature of their action though this to some degree 
is their collateral effect of course in connexion with the 
purely mental consideration of each of these special classes 
of subjects the physical condition of the body ought to be 
studied as there is no doubt of the influence of temperament 
in producing moral and emotional peculiarities and also of 
the relation of certain cerebral conformations with specific 
intellectual qualities 

this branch of the process which concerns the obtaining 
materials out of which to construct a science of human nature 
is obviously one to a great extent of observation the 
world however has existed long enough to give us facts in 
abundance if we will only take the trouble to look out for 
them and every different position in which man has been 
placed every phase of character he has assumed is a store 
house from which the most valuable results may be drawn 
the great fear however is that in collating the experience 
afforded by various institutions and countries antipathies or 
predilections in relation to one or other may interfere and 
make correct inference on any given point impossible but 
such prejudices must be cast aside as we dismiss in natural phi 
losophy illusions of sense or prepossessions in favour of any 
illjudged theory being conscious that while such distortions 
remain we are incapable of moral science indeed more cau 
tion is required in divesting ourselves of such preconceived 
notions in this division of the sciences than in physics tor 
observation here is almost solely at work in the preliminary 
process with little or no help from artificial experiment and 
relying to a great degree on the methods of agreement and 
concomitant variations any perversion of fact therefore is 
less likely to be eliminated by more extended observation than 
where the five methods come into play and if it concern the 
operation of any institution of magnitude it will doubtless

being to examine the feelings not so much with reference to the laws 
of their own nature as to a particular theory viz that of their empi

of human nature on which such institution relies for its suc 
cess and so interfere with the process by which the specific 
law is resolved into the ultimate principles of psychology 

it is only after a careful examination of the laws of the 
homogeneous groups both in their simple and conjunct action 
that we can expect to reach that general knowledge of the 
order of antecedence and sequence in psychological pheno 
mena which will enable us from a few combinations to 
rise to the general principles at work in the production 
of their complex states and connect them by deductive in 
ference with the axiomata media from which they branch out 
into ramified connexion with particular facts jstow since it 
is entirely in our power to modify such general principles by 
directing them to a given end man by the faculty which 
such knowledge would confer upon him might become in 
some measure his own automaton he need only calculate 
the human agencies at work in the production of a given 
character to superinduce that character either upon himself 
or others that is allowing that time permitted the operating 
causes to work out the result and that his physical and 
mental constitution opposed no insuperable barrier to their 
action knowing from the general laws of mind what actual 
or possible combination of circumstances are capable of pro 
moting or preventing the production of certain qualities it is 
obvious he can not only predict the particular type of cha 
racter which would follow any assumed set of circumstances 
but generate any quality he wishes in others if those circum 
stances should be in his power as the science however 
in its elementary stages is inductive and as all its subse 
quent processes concern tangible facts the deduction of 
specific qualities accruing from particular circumstances of 
position must always be verified by the recognised results 
of actual experience as in the physical concrete deductive 
sciences whose method the science of human nature assumes 
each a priori deduction must be compared with inductive 
inference from particulars the theoretic conclusion as to the 
type of character which should be formed by any given set of 

 one of the facts which such investigations are calculated to bring 
to light is that men differ less in natural capacities than is commonly 
supposed and that much is set down to genius which is only the result 
of artificial aids and methods

circumstances must be tested by the specific experience 
those circumstances whenever obtainable and the whole con 
clusions of the science must undergo constant verification 
and correction from the general observations of mankind 

the phenomena of society are produced by the operation 
of outward circumstances upon masses of human beings but 
as the laws in operation among the single individuals which 
compose the aggregate body are those of human nature it 
follows that the phenomena of society are produced by 
complex combinations of the principles which govern human 
thought feeling and action hence the social states are 
quite as much the product of fixed laws as the individual 
states the phenomena are only more complex and the proxi 
mate principles more derivative not indeed from the 
number of laws in operation but from the extraordinary 
number and variety of the elements or agents which in obe 
dience to that small number of laws cooperate in producing 
the effect if the laws of human nature when concerned 
with individual phenomena required the deductive method to 
unravel the complexity of the results the need for the appli 
cation of the same method to social phenomena is doubly in 
creased when we consider that this group of subjects arises 
out of a multiplication of the complexity considered in the 
most intricate phenomena of individual character if in 
deed in the latter subject crude empiricism was to be con 
demned in sociology it is far more censurable since the laws 
of human nature at this stage exist in far more complex 
states and present more intricate problems for solution than 
are to be met with in individual character 

up to this time however with few exceptions the only 
attempts made to modify social states or even to theorise 
upon the regeneration of society have been of this character 
apart from all consideration as to the organisation of any 
particular state of society men have advocated measures for 
their amelioration influenced by no other motive than that 
the specifics recommended had been found good in other in 
stances forgetting that one remedy could not cure all 
diseases and that what was salutary in one climate might 

 mr mill treats these laws as a distinct science under the name of

prove poisonous in another after a measure was deemed 
good in itself the only question which these philosophic poli 
ticians asked themselves was how can we get the people to 
adopt it no social arrangement that might be deemed 
desirable was expected to encounter any obstacles from the 
organism of the society to which it was to be applied but solely 
from the private interests or prejudices of the individuals 
who constituted its members statesmen thus attempted to 
master the pathology and therapeutics of the social system 
before they had laid the necessary foundations in its physio 
logy to remove distempers without understanding the laws 
of health and the result was such as it must always be when 
men even of conspicuous ability attempt to deal with the 
complex questions of a science before its simpler and more 
elementary propositions have been established 

there is a close analogy between the organisation of dif 
ferent states of individual character and those of social com 
munities in the latter as in the former there are homo 
geneous groups of phenomena capable of being studied apart 
from the general subject and forming in themselves the 
nucleus of distinct sciences such are political economy 
the science which concerns the formation of political charac 
ter or the character belonging to each age and country and 
the science of government each of these subjects takes into 
consideration a distinct class of phenomena mutually de 
pendent upon one another and not likely to be much inter 
fered with by the action of the other agencies which enter 
into the organisation of society at least beyond results which 
are capable of being calculated and allowed for in every 
instance thus political economy takes cognisance of such 
phenomena of the social state as are generated by the pur 
suit of wealth it makes entire abstraction of every other 
human passion or motive except those which may be regarded 
as antagonist to the desire of gain viz aversion to labour and 
desire of present enjoyment nor are its results when the data 
are fairly expressed ever wide of the truth for notwithstand 
ing men in all cases are not influenced by the desire of obtain 
ing wealth with the least possible labour upon which supposi 
tion the fundamental axioms of the science proceed it cannot 
be denied that in commercial speculations such assumptions 
hold and since the principles of political economy are only

applied to transactions of this nature provided they exactly 
express the laws of the tendencies to which they refer they 
are never likely to mislead now it is only when the phe 
nomena are so restricted to a definite class of subjects that we 
are favourably situated for acquiring a knowledge of the 
minuter agencies which enter into the organism of the 
social state and calculating a priori by direct deduction 
the eifect of any single law for in such cases the circum 
stances with which the new law will interfere are previously 
known and no counteracting or disturbing agent can lie con 
cealed to mar the correctness of the calculation founded upon 
their absence for instance suppose the effect is required 
to be known of commuting a certain quantity of indirect for 
direct taxation will the result be an augmentation of the 
wealth and productive labour of the community such a ques 
tion is able to be answered by purely a priori considerations j 
for the phenomena with which the law has to deal are distinctly 
marked out by the nature of the case and little inference is 
required to calculate how far the changes in question are 
likely to operate to the advantage of the community the 
result of such direct reasoning can of course be easily veri 
fied by an appeal to actual experiment in this manner peel 
worked out those judicious alterations in the british tariff 
which have already made his name illustrious among european 
statesmen it was commonly thought that during his first 
trials he was picking his way by the empirical process of 
observation and thus making experiments on the nation as 
m majendie used to try his specifics on dogs and rabbits 
but the fact was otherwise peel had convinced him 
self that such alterations were judicious and the deliberate 
manner in which he worked them out was simply to afford 
timely warning to the interests concerned as well as to 
realise the sage counsel of bacon in all your innovations 
imitate nature whose changes are quiet and imperceptible 
c 

but it is obvious that the conclusion arrived at in this 
particular case could not be generalised and erected into a 
universal proposition of political economy had peel been 
desirous to extend the same principle to any other european 
country his object should have been to ascertain how far its 
financial condition was analogous to that of england and to 



 methods of tiie mobal sciences b t 

what extent and in what direction the industry and habits of 
the people were likely to be influenced by the change if the 
wealth of the nation was more equally distributed than in 
england were its merchants and principal speculators just 
struggling into importance and its artisans in a flourishing 
condition it is obvious that a commutation of a portion of 
the customs and excise for a direct tax upon capital would 
be attended with ruinous effects it would be a blow against 
the rising civilisation of the community calculated to strike 
down those who manifested any aptitude to direct or manage 
its resources and prevent them from grasping those facilities 
which might enable them to economise labour to open new 
commercial channels to the enterprise of their countrymen 
and found institutions of education and benevolence hence 
the results of such speculations are necessarily hypothetical 
no branch of the sociological sciences will help us to a uni 
versal proposition stating in every case the effect of any 
given law but simply enables us to adapt the law to suit the 
circumstances of any given case the separate study of the 
structure of the homogeneous parts of the social organism 
makes the statesman acquainted with all the phenomena 
with which the contemplated law is likely to interfere just 
as the knowledge of any particular organ of the human 
system enables the physician to state a priori what agencies 
are destined to be neutralised counteracted or promoted by 
the action of certain diets and medicine and it is the pro 
vince of the medical or political operator to frame a law whose 
action on that particular function of the system is destined 
to eliminate the unsound tendencies and promote the healthy 
action of the vigorous parts the several branches of the 
sociological sciences will furnish him with a multitude of 
generalisations for this purpose true under the circumstances 
in which they were obtained it depends on his own tact 
how far he may be enabled to bring the new case contem 
plated under any one of these heads in order that the same 
specific may be applied with as little alteration of the text of 
the law as the circumstances warrant but it is obviously the 
duty of every statesman before he applies his law however 
cautiously its provisions may have been framed to meet the 
peculiar circumstances of the case to examine if the kindred 
sociological science will supply him with any instances of 



c ii vebimcations of sociology 

the effects of similar laws on analogical phenomena and so 
verify his conclusions by actual experience if such prece 
dents however cannot be found if either the law or the 
circumstances to which it was applied manifest any startling 
discrepancies of character or if he has reason to think that 
notwithstanding the generalisation is similar which form the 
peculiarities of the case many of the operating conditions 
lie concealed the only possible mode of verification open to 
the statesman is to deduce from the principles involved in 
his law as much of the phenomena to which it refers both 
in past ages and different communities as would be likely to 
be affected by it and show that the results of past experience 
completely harmonises with the conclusions of his theory 
if his expectations of the effects of any given cause in an 
assumed set of circumstances will not enable the statesman 
to explain and account for all that portion of the social phe 
nomena existing in times past or present which that cause 
would have a tendency to influence it is a proof either that 
the facts which ought to be taken into account are not 
known or that the theory is not sufficiently accurate to meet 
all the consequences in either case a statesman would do 
well to reconstruct his theory and not venture to predict 
the future by inference from any data that could not be 
brought in unison with the present and the past 

the inquiries which concern these special branches of 
social phenomena generally concern the effects which will 
follow from single causes in a certain condition of social cir 
cumstances but there is also a second inquiry with relation 
to the laws which preside over the general circumstances 
themselves and determine the order of sequence and ante 
cedence between one social state and another it is found 
for example when the history of past ages is consulted among 
the various states of society existing in the different regions 
of the earth that certain uniformities exist between succes 
sions of phenomena so that one feature of society never as 
sumes a particular state without affecting the coexisting 
states in a more or less precisely determinate manner for 
example among highly civilised communities the existence 
of an extremely despotic monarchy is invariably attended 
with laxity of moral ties and if perpetuated for a long period 
causes a decline of the arts degradation of literature and a 



 methods of the moral sciences b v 

general retrogression of humanity and in like manner 
where insuperable harriers are erected between the classes 
of any community and the highest social functions are only 
open to certain privileged castes mankind are never sure to 
emerge from a semibarbarous state or to make any advance 
in civilisation such uniformities between certain states of 
society and institutions are mere derivative laws from the 
higher principles of human nature and can readily be ac 
counted for a priori for if it be an axiom as it assuredly is 
that the phenomena of society are mere creatures of mind 
and that the arrangements which they manifest are more or 
less in accordance with the fitness of things according to the 
degree in which the mental agent manifests its supremacy 
it follows that every society will flourish or decay in propor 
tion as obstacles or inducements are flung in the way of its 
influence or according to the mode in which the institutions 
of the country act upon its growth or stimulate or depress 
its development now the existence of castes or slavery to 
any large extent or an imprimateur clapped on the press or 
the gagging of public opinion has this direct tendency and 
such exclusions and prohibitions cannot be perpetuated 
through generations without engendering corruption of man 
ners and turning society itself into an instrument for the 
degradation of humanity 

the prosecution of sociology nevertheless in its present 
stage labours under great disadvantages on account of the 
backward state of psychological science into which its laws 
are destitaed to be ultimately resolved while the prin 
ciples of psychology fluctuate no derivative uniformity ob 
servable between coexisting or successive states of social 
phenomena can be verified by its connexion with the corre 
sponding psychological laws and the only mode of ascertain 
ing the correctness of generalisations obtained by an analytical 
survey of history is to resolve them into the simpler laws to 
which they inferentially lead and to test their correctness 
at this stage by comparing the results to which they conduct 
both in social and psychological phenomena with specific ex 
perience thus in the cases already cited of the obnoxious 
character of those institutions which tend to depress intellect 
the principle into which the uniform phenomena were re 
solved obtains not only in individual instances but in every 
single exertion of the human faculties for those men are 



c ii social statics and dynamics 

the foremost of our species in whom mind has most largely 
predominated and who have opposed the least obstacle to its 
influence and every reflex act of thought directed to resolve 
any problem is more likely to obtain its purpose in propor 
tion to the continuity and vigour with which it is exercised 
or according to the abstracting power by which it shuts out 
extraneous influence and fastens on its object a truth of 
which newton acknowledged the force when on being asked 
by what means he succeeded in revealing that wonderful law 
which unlocked the mechanism of the heavens he replied 
by always thinking about it when principles are reached 
of this extensive kind which account deductively for all the 
social phenomena in which they can be supposed to possess 
any large influence if they may not be assumed to be the 
ultimate psychological laws wanting in the case at least they 
may fairly be relied on as corollaries from them and so far 
allowed to form the standard of indirect verification 

the empirical uniformities which it is the object of obser 
vation to set apart as most likely to lead to the discovery of 
sociological laws relate either to coexistent or successive 
phenomena and according as this science is occupied in 
ascertaining and verifying the former sort of uniformities or 
the latter m comte gives it the title of social statics or of 
social dynamics conformably to the distinction in mechanics 
between the conditions of equilibrium and those of move 
ment or in biology between the laws of organisation and 
those of life the first branch of the science ascertains the 
conditions of stability in the social union the nature of the 
relation existing between the different parts of the social 
organism in its healthiest state the second concerns the 
laws of progress or the theory of society in a state of con 
tinuous movement it must however be observed that the 
study of social statics can never be so completely disentangled 
from the second branch as not to be in a great degree modi 
fied and controlled by its laws as the uniformities of co 
existence obtaining between social phenomena are mere 
corollaries from the laws of causation by which the succes 
sive states of those phenomena are determined the mutual 
actions and reactions of cotemporaneous social states are

mere complex effects arising from the fundamental movement 
going on among them the mutual correlation therefore 
between the different elements of each state of society is a 
derivative law resulting from the laws of succession between 
one state of society and another and if we make a provi 
sional abstraction for the purpose of marking the coincidences 
between their simultaneous effects it is not only with a view 
to ascertain the elements of social stability and many unifor 
mities of practical importance but also to approach closer to 
the resolution of the fundamental problem of sociology and 
discover the laws according to which any state of society pro 
duces the state which succeeds it and takes its place 

of the practical value of this division of the science there 
cannot be a doubt to him who considers the flood of light 
capable of being shed upon the laws of social phenomena by 
regarding them in the two special states of mutual depen 
dence and correlation and making the uniformities of co 
existence and succession act as verificatory tests of each other 
it is moreover through the study of the uniformities of co 
existence that we are led to observe the more recondite laws 
which preside over the generation of successive states of 
society of which the derivative laws of correlation are mere 
complex exemplifications and to form those general maxims 
of the widest possible utility in statesmanship which embody 
the elements of social union the principles which consti 
tute the ligaments by which the different parts of the social 
organism is bound together the ingredients which enter 
into those ligaments and tend to increase or corrode their 
vigour and the chief properties on which the healthy action 
of the leading functions depend both in their individual 
states and conjunct agency by this branch of sociology we 
are able to determine from the absence or the presence of 
certain elements in any given society the general features 
which characterised its past condition just as we may infer 
from the state of the abstract sciences in any age the amount 
of erudition possessed by its leading sages 

in examining the elements of social stability the states 
man will not only regard the essential requisites whose 

 a case in point is furnished in the dissipation of the pretended 
astronomical lore ascribed to the egyptian priests as soon as it was 
known that abstract geometry did not exist among them

presence is indispensable to the perpetuity of its functions

in which they have exerted their action he cannot fail to 
observe for example the effects of severe restraining disci

martial spirit infused into their population both by the cultiva 
tion of a strong feeling of nationality and by throwing open 
the highest posts of command to the ambition of the meanest 
soldier he will not fail to observe the effect of an equitable 
administration of justice in teaching men to respect law and 
the diminution of national wealth in proportion as property 
became insecure and as excessive commercial restrictions were 
adhered to nor can it escape his attention that without 
some form of religion no society can hold together long and 
that the degree of its influence may be taken as a fair index 
of the soundness and durability of the concomitant parts 
the indispensable conditions for the foundations of the 
social fabric may indeed be deduced a priori from the laws 
of human nature but the precise degree in which they 
ought to be combined to bring about a certain result must 
be gleaned from a close examination of social phenomena 
and the knowledge so obtained afterwards verified by com 
parison with psychological laws and the known results of 
analogical combinations by the pursuit of such methods

the great object of social dynamics is to trace each of the 
principal features of every generation to its causes in the 
generation immediately preceding it this may appear where 
single states are concerned to present little difficulty for 
every element in each nation can have its causes distinctly 
marked out among the aggregate conditions that constituted 
the state of society in the preceding centuries but such 
special cases only compose the materials of the elements

aim of social dynamics to resolve in their complex causes

of the general phases which constitute the character of any 
one generation the difficulty of establishing this filiation 
and mounting to the most general laws of the succession of 
social states is increased in proportion to the number of 
distinct nations and to the discrepancies of government 
which they involve for according as men are kept under 
the action of various and often clashing agencies the uni 
formities of succession as well as of coexistence become 
more fragmentary and present insuperable obstacles to the 
science which seeks to evolve them out of general laws 
nevertheless this difficulty is not without its advantage in 
affording a more ample field for the verification of the middle 
axioms of the science since the assumed general uniformity 
may fairly be regarded as a derivative law of human nature if 
it accounts for all the phenomena which falls under its influ 
ence in so diversified a theatre 

as it is only through the intermediate uniformities that 
we can hope to grasp the higher generalisations of the 
science the means of testing their correctness cannot be too 
highly valued now this is afforded to us through the varie 
gated social phenomena which constitute the living society 
of every age and the different degrees of prosperity and 
decline they manifest in the various stages of their existence 
if any uniformities of succession will enable us to explain 
why some nations continue to remain as they have begun 
and scarcely seem to ebb and flow while others have spent 
their vigour at the commencement and others blazed out 
in glory a little before their extinction why the meridian 
of some have been the most splendid and others have fluc 
tuated and experienced at different periods of their existence 
different reverses of fortune it is evident that such uni 
formities found available for scientific explanation in so many 
contrary instances may be relied upon as derivative laws 
even if they only make out the case so far as their influence 
in the generation of the phenomena could be expected to 
extend axioms of this nature which can be brought to the 
test of diversified experience must form the first stepping 
stones to higher laws and if they can be deduced from the 
ultimate principles of human nature these higher generalisa 
tions which it is the object of sociology to reach will be 
brought within the limits of judicious conjecture and the

suggestion started easily verified by comparison either with 
the a priori law or with the simpler uniformities already 
revealed 

the laws of social dynamics have been hitherto sought by 
two distinct paths the consilience of which on any one 
point has been deemed to furnish a strong verification of the 
generality of the resulting uniformity the progressive 
tendencies of society have been pursued both in individual 
communities and large groups of nations whose social ele 
ments bore in any respects a kindred character the con 
clusion in m comtes view broadly announces the law that 
the course of progressive states of society as well as that 
of separate nations and individuals is marked by three dis 
tinct phases the theological which presides over the elemen 
tary stage the metaphysical which is the distinguishing 
characteristic of the middle and the sceptical or positive 
philosophic feature which is the predominant element in the 
third this generalisation however notwithstanding some 
striking coincidences is not reconcileable with fact nor 
is one of so sweeping a nature likely to be gained while 
the elementary laws of the science which must form the 
platform to such a principle are not yet raised from 
the ground similar empirical axioms have been gathered 
from an analytical survey of social phenomena of a less pre 
tentious character and more within the limits of truth but 
still open to occasional exceptions and of course unverified 
by psychological laws such as the aphorism of bacon that 
in the beginning of states arms flourish while intellectual 
qualities are predominant in their maturity and mechanical 
agencies characterise their decline and those of some french 
historians which imply that as society advances mental quali 
fications gradually assume control over animal force and 
masses prevail over individuals that the first occupation of 
mankind is chiefly military which becomes by degrees ab 
sorbed in productive pursuits until the spirit of clanship is 
entirely transformed into an agent of the industrial arts 
these generalisations even if strictly true only assume the 
appearance of so many sage conjectures and can be held of 
no scientific value until shown to arise out of psychological 
principles and connected with the more complex uniformi 
ties to which they are akin the error of speculation in 



 methods of the moeal sciences b v 

this branch of sociology appears to consist in grasping at 
vague generalities which seem to coincide with fact but 
leave us without knowledge to state why they do so 

such generalisations however useful they may prove in 
the subsequent stages of the science can be of no avail 
before the science can hardly be said to have commenced 
to attempt to inaugurate the study of an a posteriori science 
by the fashioning of such universal propositions is like com 
mencing to erect a building by the formation of pediments 
to which we have no reason to know that the edifice will 
correspond the only mode by which any advance can be 
made in the construction of sociological science is by 
mounting from the simplest and most evident unifor 
mities to those of a more universal and complex character 
and seeking at every step to infer what laws of human 
nature are involved in their production a successful in 
ference will lead us to connect many generalisations before 
deemed empirical with the ultimate principles of psychology 
and to interweave them in a web of confirmatory relation with 
the lowest uniformities of the science thus stations will 
ultimately become opened in all quarters and crosslines 
interposed so that no accurate generalisation can be drawn 
from history without having its higher laws assigned and 
being fitted into its precise place in the system this is 
the invariable method by which all sciences that relate to 
successive phenomena which have reached a high degree of 
development have been cultivated nor can we see any 
thing in sociology to exempt it from its influence yet the 
science was no sooner propounded by vico and began to 
excite any degree of attention than its cultivators entered 
into hot discussion upon the last question that the science 
even in the highest state of maturity could be expected to 
resolve viz whether there results from the progressive 
movements of society either a cycle or a trajectory course 
whether society revolves in an orbit or moves in a straight 
line and so never returns to any of its former states a 
problem whose resolution has about the same relation to 
the discovery of social laws as the disquisitions of thales on 
the first element of all things have to the galilean physics

blish the point they are intended to support with various 
degrees of probability no bare summing up of the single 
results will give us an accurate idea of the strength of the 
cumulative evidence without taking into account the de 
flection of the converging lines of argument and the amount 
of probability the conclusion receives not only from the 
number but from the variety and opposite nature of the 
proofs for example if a certain conclusion be made out by 
three lines of argument each establishing a probability in its 
favour varying as f and in adding up these fractional 
probabilities it ought to be taken into account to what 
degree the adduced reasons vary in their subjectmatter 
and if this be to any extent an additional fraction should 
be annexed to the aggregate sum to represent the im 
probability arising from the inference that a proposition 
should be untrue which was supported by testimony of so 
discordant a nature there are likewise cases in which 
some deduction must be made from the total result for 
a contrary reason for example if the testimony of three 
witnesses be taken who have been in collusion with each 
other in casting up the individual probabilities in favour 
of each partys testimony an abatement must be made in con 
sideration of the identity of interest existing between them 

the latter is an instance of joining probabilities by way of 
addition the result of which is an aggregate probability greater 
than the individual instances of which it is composed there 
is another mode by way of deduction where the certainty 
diminishes with every new instance of probability implied in 
the proof as when we adduce the testimony of one witness 
that he has heard a thing asserted by another who was not 
himself an original witness but who obtained it from one 
who professed to have ocular evidence of the fact the 
former chain of evidence was termed by mr bentham a self 
corroborative chain the latter a selfinfirmative chain 

both are applicable to the summation of that class of pro 
positions whether physical or moral which approximate to 
the truth but do not universally obtain in all cases such as 
most pious men are grave most rulers are influenced by 
selfinterest the generality of aged persons are cautious

c ii limitation of peobabilites 

now it often happens when such proximate generalisations 
are connected with others in a given proportion through a 
term which is common to both that it is required to be 
known what probability will attach to the occurrence of the 
new term with either of the other terms thus if two out 
of every three pious men are grave and three out of every 
four studious men are grave what probability is there that 
every pious and studious man will have the property of 
gravity the answer will obviously be y for the pro 
bability against the supposition will arise out of the com 
pound of the single probabilities now against the occur 
rence of the first there is the chance of and against the 
second j the compound result of which t deduced from 
unity assigns the probability we have determined upon 
hence the aggregate probability is greater than the indi 
vidual ones f or again suppose that proximate generali 
sations similarly connected were required to be dealt with 
by way of deduction the probability arising from two pro 
positions taken together in this case will be correctly mea 
sured by the probability arising from one abated in the ratio 
of that arising from the other thus if nine out of ten 
charitable persons are religious and five out of every twenty 
inhabitants in london are charitable the probability that 
any metropolitan citizen is religious will be y or somewhat 
less than i it is evident that there can be many links to 
such calculations but each additional step only involves a 
repetition of the principle we have laid down 

proximate truths of this kind may however occasionally 
be transformed into universal propositions of scientific accu 
racy by assigning some mark which clearly separates the 
accordant from the exceptional cases and reasonings de 
pendent upon them may be carried to any length we please 
by taking care in the introduction and composition of every 
fresh generalisation to annex the sign on which its uni 
versality depends for instance the proposition most per 
sons who have uncontrolled power employ it ill may be in 
vested with a universal character either by assigning the 
features which invariably characterise licentious despots 
viz weakness of judgment and will with depraved habits 
or by assuming the opposite qualities to these as exceptional 
cases thus all persons of weak judgment and depraved 



 methods of the moeal sciences b v 

habits who have uncontrolled power employ it ill or all 
persons who have uncontrolled power employ it ill provided 
they are not persons of unusual strength of judgment and 
confirmed habits of virtue now if we annex to this pro 
position another of a similar character as all absolute 
monarchs have uncontrolled power who are independent of 
the active support of their subjects we may deduce from both 
the universal conclusion that all absolute monarchs employ 
their power ill who do not need the active support of their 
subjects unless they are persons of unusual strength of 
judgment and confirmed habits of virtue it is of no con 
cern how rapidly such conditions accumulate provided we 
assign the distinguishing rank to each proposition and ex 
press the aggregate with every additional conclusion 

occasionally as in reasonings which concern large masses 
and do not in the slightest degree affect the actions of iso 
lated individuals proximate generalisations are all that is 
required even to establish a conclusion of scientific value 
neither the general or the statesman desires complete accu 
racy in the data on which they found their respective mea 
sures for the guidance of the numbers over whom they pos 
sess control it is enough for them to know that most 
persons comport themselves in a particular way since their 
speculations refer almost exclusively to cases in which vast 
groups of men are acted upon simultaneously and in which 
therefore what is done or felt by most persons determines 
the result produced by or upon the general body in these 
cases proximate truths assume the nature of precise gene 
ralisations with reference to the results to which they are in 
tended to lead the properties of multitudes can only be 
ascertained by approximations of this nature but they are 
not the less strictly amenable on that account to scientific 
law than those of individuals 

the probable inferences in the moral sciences which corre 
spond to those drawn in the physical from the resemblance 
of their objects to phenomena whose properties for the most 
part lie beyond the grasp of our faculties may be ranged 
under the head of example and analogy we are not able to 
penetrate beyond the vista of the present and form indu 
bitable inferences with respect to the future effects of certain 
actions upon any specific individual for being ignorant of the 



c ii argument of example 

impulsive forces which generate individual character and the 
laws according to which they act we want all the data that 
could help us to a conclusion of scientific value yet we augur 
the complexion of those effects and in the generality of cases 
find we are not far short of the truth these conclusions 
are found to predict in many cases with tolerable accuracy 
what will be the future position of a character chiefly de 
pendent on fame on knowledge and talent for success 
and that with no further data on the part of their framers 
than what is afforded by superficial observation they 
know what has occurred in past instances will occur again 
if similar conditions supervene and they leap from the re 
semblance of properties to that of effects this is strictly 
the argument of example it is induction on practical mat 
ters the laws of whose action are hidden from us but whose 
uniformities we nevertheless predict grounding our inference 
upon the effects which the laws have exhibited in the past 
of this kind of loose induction horace will afford us an 
example if my father says the poet wished to per 
suade me from squandering my estate in profligate living he 
would point to some spendthrift who had ruined himself 
the father of the bard left him to infer from the example of 
barrus and the son of albus who had both impoverished 
themselves by luxurious living that those who so act com 
monly come to ruin the staple argument of most people 
assumes a similar form they judge simply from past effects 
and according to the constancy with which the uniformity in 
question has obtained they imply its occurrence in future 

to such kind of inference there can be no objection if not 
stretched further than the limits in which it has been ob 
served warrant but the evil is that men leap from a few 
casual instances of successive or concomitant uniformity to a 
wide generalisation implying a law of causation between the 
phenomena concerned having observed that the country 
prospered under unfair institutions or that trade flourished 

 insuevit pater optimus hoc me 
ut fugerem exemplis vitiorum quaeque notando

during the last war they arrive at the sweeping conclusion 
without looking into the circumstances of the case that such 
institutions are essential to the welfare of the community 
and that commerce is increased by foreign war but pre 
vious to any inference being made men should not only 
regard things as they are but look to the causes which pro 
duce them and endeavour to discover their mutual inde 
pendence if the uniformity seem to be connected with no 
law that we can discover the extent to which it is to be 
relied upon is simply a case of calculation by the ordinary 
laws of probability where however it appears as the result 
of a causal tie between the sequential or concomitant pheno 
mena the laws of which however we cannot calculate we 
may regard the uniformities as universal laws and predict 
their occurrence in all instances which do not present coun 
teracting obstacles to their agency the discovery however 
of such conflicting agencies and the nature of the law on 
which the uniformities themselves depend are necessary to 
raise them out of the category of conditional truths and 
invest their prediction with scientific certainty 

analogical evidence in a strictly moral sense comprises 
that kind of inference which is drawn from mere resem 
blance of relations as if from the assumption that the colo 
nies stand in the same relation to the mother country as a 
child to its parent any one were to argue that unconditional 

 every one knows says bishop berkeley in his minute philo 
sopher that analogy is a greek word used by mathematicians to 
signify a similitude of proportions for instance when we observe 
that two is to six in the same proportion ratio as three is to nine 
this similarity or equality of proportions ratios is termed analogy 
the schoolmen tell us that there is analogy between intellect and sight 
forasmuch as intellect is to the mind what sight is to the body and 
that he who governs the state is analogous to him who steers a ship 
it would however greatly contribute to philosophical exactness if the 
word were confined to one of the three senses for which it is now too 
indiscriminately used we have called in conjunction with most 
metaphysicians the grounds of analogy those on which the physical 
sciences rest if this term be accurate another ought to be found to 
distinguish resemblance of qualities and a third distinct from the two 
preceding to express similarity of relation while the three meanings 
are huddled together under one name confusion of ideas must ine 
vitably ensue 



 see foundations of evidence p with note 



c ii argument of analogy 

obedience to all the degrees of the central authority was the 
clear duty of the colonists or from the similarity of relation 
existing between a nation and its rulers and a jointstock 
company and its board that the people were perfectly at 
liberty to choose their own governors cashier them for mis 
conduct and in case of need to frame a government for 
themselves in this narrow sense however analogy is rather 
suited for illustration than argument nor can we adduce any 
example in which its force arises above that of weak proba 
bility arguments which arise from the direct similarity of 
things are weak enough when the evidence does not amount 
to a complete induction but when we introduce the element 
of the similarity of relation of things the amount of proba 
bility dwindles in rapid proportion and exhibits an inherent 
inferiority of conclusiveness 

it however very frequently happens that analogical argu 
ment is capable of meeting both cases and rests its inference 
not only on similarity of relation but on the direct resem 
blance between the things themselves as an instance of 
the high conclusive force which double analogies of this kind 
are capable of attaining we may adduce butlers famous 
argument in favour of the divine origin of christianity the 
proof may be said to consist in close compact inference from 
the resemblance of the system of nature and the economy of 
gods visible dispensation in the natural world to the system 
of religion and the economy of god with regard to the present 
and future state of our moral being we may also regard it 
as an argument by strict analogy inferring the truth of the 
christian religion from the fact that it puts forth the same 
relations to man and its author as the system of nature if 
we grant therefore that god created nature we cannot well 
avoid the conclusion that the christian scheme so similar to 
it in its deepest and broadest relations should have sprung 
from the hands of the same artificer the force however of 
the argument in the last case is derived from the strength 
which attends it in the former or may be said to be con 
founded with it from the evidence of design and profound 
adaptation of parts to meet certain ends which the christian 
religion exhibits we infer its divine origin just because similar 
evidence in the case of nature has led mankind to the conclu 
sion that it came from god the conclusiveness of the proof 
does not proceed from mere similarity of relation but from the 



 methods of the moeal sciences b y 

fact of that resemblance arising out of vastness of design and 
intricate and elaborate coordination of parts with reference 
to a constituted whole which mark both systems and stamp 
them as the works of the same author the degree of con 
fidence to be placed in this and similar analogical arguments 
will depend of course on the amount of similarity as con 
trasted with that of dissimilarity involved in the case taken 
in conjunction with the extent of our knowledge of the indi 
vidual subjects whose properties are compared if the unex 
plored region of unascertained properties be large or if we 
have reason to think that many remain concealed whose dis 
covery might affect the probability to which the recognised 
resemblances point faint stress indeed should be laid upon 
the evidence 

notwithstanding the argument of analogy in the cases 
already contemplated is never able to reachabove a high de 
gree of probability it may occasionally form the ground of rigid 
scientific inference in disproof of the position of an adversary 
though it cannot help the philosopher to a certain conclusion 
on any one point it can enable him by means of what the 
ancients called twraois to demolish every position which his 
adversary takes up against it evidence which may be inade 
quate to establish a complete inference may be amply suffi 
cient for refutation if the peculiar character of the subject 
prevented butler from demonstrating with scientific rigour 
the divine origin of the christian faith he at all events 
annihilated with the analogical weapon the position assumed 
by the deists of his day viz that the christian religion could 
not be true since it contradicted and falsified the natural pre 
sumptions and intuitive convictions of mankind by proving 
that the system of nature involves difficulties of no less 
startling a character he thus overthrew a falsely assumed 
principle by the allegation of an unanswerable fact 

 instance brought forward to disprove the general principle of an 
adversary see karslakes aids to the study of logic vol ii p 
 butler himself seems to have regarded his argument in this light 
for he writes if there be an analogy or likeness between that 
system of things and dispensations of providence which revelation in 
forms us of and that system of things and dispensation of providence 
which experience together with reason informs us of i e the known 
course of nature this is a presumption that they both have the same

as we have followed the reasoning process in every diver 
sified combination it assumes in science and laid bare the 
mechanism by which every description of scientific truth is 
reached it only remains for us to notice the variety of illu 
sions to which the process is exposed the different forms in 
which error is capable of simulating reason and deceiving 
mankind to some extent indeed this has been already 
performed at every stage of the scientific process certain 
errors were to be guarded against and corresponding decep 
tions pointed out yet since many remain unnoticed and all 
are more or less connected in a chain of mutual dependence 
and relation it becomes essential to a scientific view of the 
subject to allot to them a distinct portion of the treatise 

fallacies are commonly divided into two grand classes ac 
cording as they interfere either with the canons of the syllo 
gism or introduce false premises or lead to a conclusion 
different to that of which proof is required the first are called 
fallacies in dictione or formal fallacies in which the conclusion 
does not follow from the premises the latter are termed 
extra dictionem or material fallacies which are good as far as 
the reasoning is concerned but false as to the matter the 
premises being either wrongly assumed or the conclusion 
foreign to the subject the first kind may be considered under 
two heads the fallaciousness of some being evident from 
the bare form of the expression without regard to the mean 
ing of the terms such as undistributed middle illicit process 
and negative premiss while that of others requires the mate 
rial sense of the middle term to be inquired into before the 
ambiguity can be cleared up which happens in all cases of 
ambiguous middle term except its nondistribution of 

author and cause at least so far as to answer objections against the 
former being from god drawn from anything which is analogical or 
similar to what is in the latter for an author of nature is here sup 
posed introduction to the analogy see karslakcs aids c vol

 fallacies b vi 

these we shall treat in two chapters under the head of formal 
fallacies and fallacies of language 

the material fallacies in their moral and physical rela 
tions may be ranked under premiss unduly assumed and 
irrelevant conclusion the former class will lead to the 
consideration of non causa pro causa in all the various phases 
it is capable of assuming in both order of sciences as incom 
plete enunciation groundless assumption false analogies and 
petitio principii or the assumption of a premiss either iden 
tical with the conclusion or unfairly implying it irrelevant 
conclusion will comprise that large magazine of fallacies so 
commonly drawn upon by vulgar dialecticians such as ap 
peals to the passions shifting ground eternal raising of 
objections and use of complex terms which enable the dia 
lectician while employing the same words to make out his 
case in a sense quite foreign to the matter in dispute an 
additional chapter on this branch of fallacies will exhaust 
the subject 

there is no fallacy which does not fall naturally under 
one of the foregoing heads even those sophisms which 
arise from selflove interest or passion and which so power 
fully influence civil concerns ordinarily involve some of the 
intellectual obliquities above referred to and are capable of 
being hunted out and condemned on the same grounds the 
idola of bacon might appear to be fallacies of another genus 
and have been so characterised by dr whewell yet on a 
close analysis they will be found mere exemplifications of 
the fallacies above enumerated only expressed in a more 
popular form for what else is characterised by bacons 
illusions of the forum idola fori but the common ambi 
guities of language or what other thing does he caution his 
readers against under the name of illusions of the tribe and 
illusions of the den idola tribus idola specus but the fal 
lacies of groundless assumption and unwarrantable induction 
in reality no fallacies have risen out of the application of the 
inferential process to modern science which had not been 
already provided for under the heads of the old logical 
division 

it must not be assumed from the strict manner in which 
we have laid down the boundaries of the different fallacies 
that each is only capable of being referred to one distinct 



c i twofold division 

head it occasionally happens that one fallacy may present 
so many different aspects according to the light in which it 
is looked at as to be referable to one or two heads under 
both the formal and material division in which case the 
only resource is to place it among that class to which it 
bears the nearest kinship this is most frequently the case 
with dialectical fallacies where the sophist either envelopes 
his false principle in a variety of disguises or avoids its 
distinct statements in the elliptical language of ordinary 
reasoning by a suppressed premiss leaving his hearers to 
supply one which is either untrue or does not establish 
the conclusion in the latter case the fallacy may not 
only have as many relations to one genus as another but 
until the sophist has drawn his inference it remains a matter 
of doubt to what particular head it may be referred for 
example if a man after dwelling on the abuses of religion 
proceed to infer that the system so deformed is false we must 
suppose him to assume either that every power distorted 
from its natural uses cannot come from god which is a 
palpable falsehood or that every false religion is corrupt 
which however true proves nothing the middle term being 
undistributed now in the former case the fallacy would 
be referred to the head of extra dictionem in the latter to 
that of in dictions it is a matter of no concern to the 
sophist whether his hearers assent to the false premiss or 
to the unsound syllogism as long as they can be brought 
to admit the conclusion

fobmal fallacies 

 illicit process and undistributed middle 

to this head may be referred all those forms of reasoning 
which violate any of the canons of pure inference as laid 
down in the book on syllogisms of this kind is the fallacy 
so much in vogue of supposing the conclusion false because 
the premiss is false or because the argument is illegitimate 

 whatelys logic chap v 
x 



 formal tallacies b vi 

as if any one should show the futility of an argument ad 
vanced to prove the divine existence and thence infer that 
god did not exist in reality the discarded argument ought 
to go for nothing its refutation proves nought beyond its 
individual weakness nor can it be extended further without 
involving an illicit process of the major thus supposing 
the existence of god was rested on the universality of the 
belief and a nation was adduced as destitute of belief the 
sophism by which such a refutation would be erected into a 
disproof of the existence of the deity would be whatever is 
universally true must be believed the existence of god is 
not universally believed therefore it is not true in which 
true is taken universally in the conclusion and only par 
ticularly in the major premiss in like manner others are 
inclined to infer the truth of the premises from that of the 
conclusion which involves the fallacy of undistributed middle 
as what is universally believed is true the existence of god 
is universally believed therefore it is true where the term 
universally believed is taken twice particularly tet it may 
be fairly assumed if an able reasoner produce no other argu 
ments in defence of his position than such as are easily 
exploded that his opinions are untenable and that the con 
verse of his doctrine is true hence no greater damage can 
accrue to a cause than to leave its defence in the hands of 
feeble advocates since ordinary people take their exposition 
as an accurate measure of all that can be said in its favour 
nothing is more common to persons who are fluctuating 
between two sets of tenets than to become firmly attached 
to one of them through hearing a weakminded advocate 
argue against them 

another fallacy akin to the present is mistaking a con 
trary for a contradictory proposition or inferring against the 
rules of opposition that because one view is false its contrary 
must be true thus if any one were to argue from the fact 
that the cholera was a visitation from god that its causes 
did not depend upon any physical laws he would fall into a 
fallacy of this kind for there is not such direct opposition 
between the two cases that both cannot be true together 
which is the law of contraries in fact the probabilities 
are strongly in favour of the latter supposition since we 
know nothing of pestilence that may not be traced to some 



c ii fallacies of hypotheticals 

kind of material agency though we cannot lay our hands 
upon the precise combination of causes in which some of 
them take their rise this fallacy appears in the form of 
undistributed middle whatever does not depend on phy 
sical laws is a visitation from god the cholera is a visitation 
from god therefore it does not depend on physical laws 

it may be observed that the infraction of the rules of 
hypotheticals viz proceeding from the denial of the ante 
cedent to that of the consequent or from the establishment 
of the consequent to the affirmation of the antecedent also 
involves illicit process of the major and undistributed middle 
thus if the existence of god be universally believed it must 
be true but it is not universally believed therefore it is not 
true and if the existence of god be true it must be uni 
versally believed but it is not universally believed therefore 
it is not true 



chaptee ii 

teebal fallacies 

 ambiguous middle 

ik the case of undistributed middle the extremes of the 
syllogism are compared with two different parts of the same 
term we have now to consider a series of fallacies in which 
the middle being used in two different senses in the two pre 
mises is compared with two different terms the first class 
of them may be referred to the head of fallacies of equivo 
cation of this kind is the argument of plato which is 
generally taken up by those who advocate a system of 
national education as a panacea for everything no one 
desires evil knowing it to be so to do wrong is evil 
therefore no one desires to do wrong cognisant of the true 
nature of what he desires but only in consequence of 
ignorance no one could assent to the major unless the 
term evil were restricted to that class of objects which either 
interfered with our own happiness or frustrated that of 
others in matters where our own interests were not con 

 in his gorgiaa

cerned in the minor however the term is taken in its 
most general sense and being in that character applied to 
the major term leads to a palpably wrong inference yet 
from this argument plato inferred that virtue is a branch of 
intelligence and is to be produced by intellectual cultivation 
and made the proposition the basis of his ethical system 
in which he was followed by most of the philosophical 
schools among the later greeks with a similar paltering 
with words in a double sense were the arguments of the 
ancients relative to the summum bonum infected the word 
good being at one time intended to mean what was good for 
oneself and at another what was good for other people 
the proper mode of dissipating such verbal ambiguities is 
by drawing a distinction and granting or denying the pro 
position according to the different meanings implied in the 
statement of the use of this instrument the scholastics 
were the most powerful masters and it still furnishes in the 
continental universities one of the most powerful weapons of 
theological controversy 

another example of ambiguous middle may be instanced 
in the argument by which many set themselves against a 
judicious reform of the electoral system thus whatever 
interferes with the influence of property is pernicious the 
measure in question interferes with the influence of pro 
perty c now the major should never be accepted in an 
unrestricted sense because property may exercise a perni 
cious as well as a beneficial influence according as it is 
administered and if the proposed measure simply tended to 
deprive the possessor of property of the power to abuse his 
influence the objection would of course fall to the ground 
there are a class of words which from being indiscriminately 
applied to distinct meanings are peculiarly liable to lead 
those who employ them into fallacies of this character 
of this kind is the word same which sometimes denotes 
similarity but is as often employed to point out identity 
as when we say the same person whom we observed 
yesterday we do not mean an individual resembling the 
one whom we saw in dress and features but the same 
identical person but if the word is applied to a house or 
a stone the expression by no means signifies identity but 

 mills system of logic vol ii p 



c ii equivocal and pabonymous wobds 

mere similarity of relation from this double signification 
of words arise frequent cases of ambiguous middle as in the 
argument of bishop berkeley to prove the existence of an 
eternal mind ideas cannot exist without a mind in which 
they inhere i have the same idea today as i had yester 
day but this would be impossible unless there was a mind 
in which it could exist during the interval of its absence 
here dr berkeley confounds under the word same resem 
blance with identity and uses the term in the latter sense 
when he ought only to have employed it in the former 

occasionady this fallacy assumes the form of an interro 
gation in which many questions are asked under the guise 
of one so that whatever answer is given the sophist may 
bring under the response the cases to which it does not 
apply to detect the ambiguity it is necessary to answer 
each question separately thus the question discussed by 
cicero in the third book of the he officiis whether anything 
vicious is expedient belongs to the fallacy of interrogation 
from the ambiguity of the word expedient which sometimes 
means conducive to temporal prosperity sometimes con 
ducive to the greatest good now if the reply to this 
question be in the negative that is if the latter sense be 
applied to the word expedient it is the custom of the sophist 
to introduce the former for example what is vicious is not 
expedient whatever conduces to wealth and aggrandisement 
is expedient therefore it cannot be vicious if the response 
be affirmative of course the order will be reversed some 
thing vicious is expedient whatever is expedient is desirable 
therefore something vicious is desirable 

another group of fallacies under this head arises from 
men taking for granted that paronymous words i e those 
which spring from one root must convey exactly the same 
meaning this assumption is of common occurrence as few 
express the terms in precisely the same words throughout 
the discourse but continually vary them to suit the structure 
of the sentence and to divest their style of a pedantic air 
nor is the practice at all illogical so long as the variety of 
expressions in which the terms are clothed point to the 
same identical meaning but since paronymous terms do not 
invariably do so the assumption when not carefully watched 

 mills system of logic vol ii p 



 verbal fallacies b ti 

is often likely to mislead thus if any one inferred from 
the fact that theorists and projectors are unfit to be trusted 
that his neighbour ought not to be trusted because he has 
formed projects or theories he would imply that the bad 
sense which we attach to mere theorists and projectors is 
equally applicable to any one who forms theories and pro 
jects which is by no means the case it is not indispensable 
to sophisms of this kind that the fallacy lurk in the middle 
term though classed under that head it may lie in one of 
the terms of the conclusions thus to be acquainted with 
the guilty is a presumption of guilt this man is so acquainted 
therefore we may presume that he is guilty this argument 
proceeds on the supposition of an exact correspondence 
between presume and presumption which however does not 
exist for presumption is commonly used to express a kind 
of slight suspicion whereas to presume amounts to abso 
lute belief such fallacies being built on the grammatical 
structure of language are usually termed fallacia figure 
dictionis 

as an additional instance of this class we may cite the use 
of the word representative which from the verb which forms 
its root is taken not unfrequently to mean in the case of a 
member of a legislative assembly a person who is bound to re 
present the exact opinions of the majority of his constituents on 
all points and never to act on his own responsibility whereas 
law and usage has defined the term to mean one who is 
chosen to represent the interests of a certain constituency 
according to the best dictates of his own judgment and un 
biassed by any undue extraneous influence such a person 
may consult the opinions of his constituents before making 
up his mind on a question that may concern them but he is 
not bound either to be their spokesman or resign his seat 
though he may pursue the latter course from motives of 
delicacy 

under the head of ambiguous middle may be ranked the 
fallacy of division which consists in the middle term being 
used in the major premiss collectively and in the minor dis 
tributively and the fallacy of composition which simply re 
verses this order taking the distributive sense first and the 
collective sense after of these the most glaring examples 

 whatelys logic ch v 



c ii fallacies of divisiok ajtd composition 

are seven is one number five and two are seven therefore 
five and two are one number or the reverse five and two 
are two numbers seven is five and two therefore seven is 
two numbers of the last kind is the owenite fallacy di 
rected against the doctrine of human responsibility he 
who necessarily goes or stays is not a free agent you must 
necessarily go or stay c in which the major is he who is 
compelled to go or compelled to stay is not a free agent 
which can be readily conceded but as the minor changes the 
middle term into sheer compulsion to take the alternative of 
these two courses the conclusion is abortive such likewise 
is the fallacy which leads many to speculate in lotteries 
which is thus stated by dr whately the gaining of a high 
prize is no uncommon occurrence and what is no uncommon 
occurrence may reasonably be expected therefore the gain 
ing of a high prize may reasonably be expected the con 
clusion being evidently confined to the person who makes the 
inference must mean reasonably expected by a certain in 
dividual therefore for the major premiss to be true the 
middle term must be understood to mean no uncommon 
occurrence to someone particular person but the minor 
which has been placed first can only be true in the sense of 
no uncommon occurrence to some one or other and thus 
gives rise to the fallacy of composition 

this fallacy is of frequent occurrence in civil concerns as 
is instanced in the mode in which people lose sight of the 
aggregate results of acts in their separate insignificance 
thus the profligate forgets while he infers that each single 
indulgence can be of little harm to his constitution that the 
collective amount may undermine its vigour nor do the 
avaricious seem to be aware while they attempt to convince 
their own conscience and others that they are not bound to 
subscribe to this or the other benevolent institution that the 
practical conclusion which they draw is that all charity may 
be dispensed with 

the last verbal fallacy we shall notice is tkefallacia acci 
dentis together with its converse fallacia a dicto secundum 
quid ad dictum simpliciter in each of which the middle is used 
m one premiss to signify something considered in its absolute 
essence and in the other to imply besides its simple nature

the accidents and relative conditions it is liable to assume 
thus in thefallacia accidentis we draw a simple unrestricted 
absolute conclusion from one that is only true by accident 
as if we were to decry antimony because on account of its 
misapplication it produces bad effects or to attribute to elo 
quence all the evils to which its abuse leads or to medicine 
the errors of certain ignorant practitioners of a similar kind 
is the fallacy of the epicureans who concluded the gods must 
have human form because among all creatures in the world 
men alone had the use of reason the gods said these philoso 
phers are very happy none can be happy without virtue 
there is no virtue without reason and reason is found nowhere 
except in the human form it must be avowed therefore 
that the gods have the human form eeason however is not 
essential to the human form but only accidentally connected 
with it it was therefore puerile to conclude that because 
the gods were endowed with mind they must also have hands 
feet and other human appurtenances the converse fallacy 
of passing from what is true in some respects to what is true 
absolutely may be instanced in another argument of this 
school of philosophers to prove the same proposition the 
gods must be invested with the human form because that form 
is most beautiful and everything beautiful must be in god 
for as the human figure is not beautiful absolutely but only 
in relation to bodies it does not follow that it must be in 
god who is only the inheritor of absolute perfection i e 
perfection without any imperfection the following is a 
similar fallacy which cicero puts into the mouth of cotta to 
disprove the existence of god if god exist he must be in 
possession of all virtue but we can attribute no virtues to 
god like those in men therefore no deity exists it did not 

 how says cotta can ve conceive god since we can attribute 
no virtue to him for shall we say that he has prudence but since 
prudence consists in the choice between good and evil what need can 
god have for this choice not being capable of any evil shall we say 
he has intelligence and reason but reason and intelligence serve to 
discover to us that which is unknown from that which is known now 
there can he nothing unknown to god neither can justice be in god 
because this relates only to the intercourse of men nor temperance 
since he has no desires to moderate nor strength since he is susceptible 
of neither pain or labour and is not exposed to any danger how 
therefore can that be a god which has neither intelligence or virtue 
cicero natura deorum b iii 



c iii oblique assumptions 

strike the framer of this argument that there was just a 
possibility that virtue in man might only exist in a relative 
state from the imperfection it exhibits and that the source 
from which it was derived might be traced back to its full 
plenitude in god to deny that there is no virtue in god 
because the imperfect virtue which exists in man cannot be 
ascribed to him is tantamount to the assertion that because 
no rivers can exist in the sea the ocean has no water or is 
equivalent to saying that the fact which proves god to have 
no intelligence is that nothing can be hid from him that 
in other words he sees nothing because he sees everything 
that he can do nothing because he can do everything that 
he enjoys no happiness because he possesses all happiness 
it is as if a rustic who having never seen any houses but 
those covered with thatch and having heard that there were 
no roofs of this nature in towns should conclude that there 
were no houses in towns and that the dwellers in them were 
exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather

 non causa pro causa fallacy of groundless 
assumptions 

the largest group of material fallacies may be assigned to 
undue assumption of premiss which is in fact the cause of 
iiearlv all the sophisms which have obstructed the progress 
of science either in the shape of incongruous theory false 
objections or any erroneous statement of fact the false 

remiss is not unfrequently introduced as a thing quite in 
ubitable of which mankind never ventured to exercise the 
slightest doubt just as charles the second made the mem 
bers of the eoyal society believe that a live fish did not 
increase the weight of any vessel of water in which it was 
placed by requesting an explanation of the phenomenon 
as a real fact sometimes the groundless statement is in 
troduced as a wellknown fact universally admitted 
or a circumstance not a little remarkable or it may 
be covertly insinuated by way of illustrating the pre 
tended fact which is so assumed thus the opponents of 



 matebial fallacies b ti 

copernicus argued that the earth did not move because in 
that event a stone let fall from the top of a high tower would 
not reach the ground at the foot of the tower but at a little 
distance from it in a contrary direction to the earths course 
in the same manner said they as a ball ivhen dropped from 
the masthead of a ship in full sail does not fall exactly at 
the foot of the mast but nearer to the stern of the vessel the 
copernicans might have silenced these objections by drop 
ping a ball from the masthead as it turned out upon 
actual experiment that it does fall at the foot as the theory 
requires but the spurious fact was so plausibly stated that 
the copernicans admitted its truth and struggled vainly to 
make out a difference between the two cases 

to this head may be referred that wide class of fallacies 
which ascribes objective existence to abstractions from 
the abstract principle that nature abhors a vacuum philoso 
phers formerly taught that vessels full of water break when 
they freeze and by the contraction of the water leave a 
vacuum which nature cannot endure it has however been 
discovered that the fracture arises from a contrary reason 
since water when frozen occupies more space than in a state 
of fluidity and consequently breaks the vessels which do not 
afford room for the expansion of a similar nature were the 
abstractions which corroded the bulk of the aristotelian 
physics such as the abstract perfection of circular motion by 
which the stagyrite attempted to prove that the planets move 
in perfect circles and the assumption that generation and 
corruption only happen between contraries which led him to 
infer that the heavenly bodies were incorruptible simply 
because circular motion had no contraries extreme in 
stances of this tendency to substitute a priori conceptions for 
actual realities may be found in the abstract notions by which 
many of the ancients sought to resolve the principles of the 
universe some placed the explanation of all phenomena in 
the to curfipov or infinitude of things others in the to ov 
and the to ov that is to say in entity and nonentity 
while an authority which was destined to command opinions 
for nearly two thousand years settled this important point 
by deciding that matter form and privation were to be con 
sidered the principle of all things 

 galileo systema cosmicum dial l p 



c hi fallacies of the gbeek philosophees 

another prejudice that leads to the fallacy of groundless 
assumption is the notion that differences in nature corre 
spond to distinctions in language extreme instances of 
which may be found in modern as well as in ancient inquiries 
with the greeks however this fallacy was most conspicu 
ously prominent partly on account of the philosophic struc 
ture of their own language which led them to imagine that 
all its generalisations of natural phenomena were exact tran 
scripts of reality and partly because their own ignorance of 
every other language debarred them from perceiving the true 
functions of language or from drawing a distinction between 
terms loosely abstracted from things by vulgar perception 
and others which had been scientifically invested with a 
determinate connotation hence they never dreamt it was 
necessary to distinguish things which their language con 
founded or to combine objects that the popular phraseology 
of the country had kept apart but they set on analysing and 
sifting the general terms of their language as if the vague 
notions they embodied had been formed by some inspired 
process and warranted by heaven to reflect the exact reality 
of things accordingly when thales was asked what is the 
greatest thing he replied place for all other things are in 
the world but the world is in it in aristotle we have the 
consummation of this mode of speculation thus in in 
quiring into the existence of void or empty space he enu 
merates the different senses in which we say one thing is 
contained in another for example the part is in the 
whole as the finger is in the hand the species is in the 
genus as man is included in animal the government of 
greece is in the king and various other senses are exem 
plified but of all these the most proper is when we say a 
thing is in a vessel or generally in a place then examining 
what place is he comes to the conclusion that if about a 
body there be another body including it it is in place and 
not if otherwise proceeding then to the question of a 
void he as usual examines the different senses in which the 
term is used and adopts as the most proper place without 
matter he then proves that so blank a thing cannot exist 
from such arguments as these in a void there could be no 
difference of up and down for as in nothing there are no 
differences so there are none in privation or negation but a 
void is merely a privation or negation of matter therefore 



 matebial fallacies u ti 

in a void bodies could not move up and down which it is in 
their nature to do when we compare such attempts to 
extract facts out of the loosest forms of language with the 
scientific reasoning of our day we may cheerfully allow the 
ancients their decided supremacy in the walks of sculpture 
and eloquence in consideration of our more splendid domi 
nion over nature 

we are not unfrequently led to take our own conceptions 
of the possible as furnishing the actual limits to which its 
boundary extends nor is this unfair if the things we place 
outside the line be really impossible in the light of being 
absolutely inconceivable without overriding some of the 
elementary principles of the thinking faculty thus it 
would be by no means wrong to assume that the same object 
cannot be in two places at the same time that something 
can spring out of nothing or that the laws of number can 
be otherwise than what they are but the evil is that men 
confound this strict sense of the word impossibility with that 
which belongs to what is purely inconceivable on the score 
of the matter which is placed in that category being entirely 
strange to them and requiring some strain on their concep 
tions before they can bring their mind to entertain it thus 
st augustine denied the existence of the antipodes be 
cause he could not see how it could be brought about 
and bacon rejected the copernican system simply because 
he could not conceive so great a void in the celestial regions 
as that system assigns to them in like manner the carte 
sians waged war against newtons law of gravitation assum 
ing the principle that a thing cannot act where it is not and 
so plausible did the objection seem to that great astronomer 
that he imagined a subtile ether to line space through the 
medium of which the attraction of the various planetary 
bodies might be conveyed to each other it is inconceivable 
said newton in propounding this theory that inanimate 
brute matter should without the mediation of something 
else which is not material operate upon and afiect other 

matter without mutual contact that gravity should 

be innate and essential to matter so that one body should act 
on another through a vacuum is to me so great an absurdity 
that i believe no man who has a competent faculty of 
thinking in philosophical matters can ever fall into it it 
does not appear to have struck newton that with regard to 



 m false sense of inconceivable 

the mere inexplicability of the phenomena that motion by 
impact is quite as mysterious as impulsion at a distance with 
no intermediate agencies between and that since the latter 
as we are fully assured is the ordinary mode by which one 
spiritual substance acts upon another we can find no diffi 
culty if circumstances require it to invest material sub 
stances with a similar property 

the same conception of impossibility has been at the 
bottom of most of the absurd theories of modern times from 
the vortices of descartes to the neptunian system of geology 
in metaphysics it has exercised rampant sway as may be wit 
nessed in the theories of malebranche and leibnitz to ac 
count for the conformity of states of mind with peculiar dis 
positions of bodies without direct contact which these phi 
losophers believed impossible leibnitz attributed the fact 
of such dissimilar substances acting in concert to a preesta 
blished harmony existing between them which caused their 
motions to beat always in unison just as two clocks which 
though unconnected strike simultaneously and always point 
to the same hour malebranches theory of occasional 
causes was a refinement on this conception instead of 
supposing the clocks originally arranged so as to strike 
together he held that when the one strikes god interposes 
and makes the other strike in correspondence with it 

no prejudice is so apt to lead men to assign real causes in 
nature to the agency of pure chimeras as that of mistaking 
their subjective notions for objective laws as may be witnessed 
to a great extent in astrologers who referring every natural 
production to the influence of the stars made out that there 
must be an immoveable heaven beyond the celestial orbs 
because the earth produces different things in different 
countries just as if india could not produce ivory and sabea 
precious drugs and italy wine and oil unless there were an 
immoveable heaven to present a diversified and unchangeable 
aspect towards different portions of the globe to the influence 
of this prejudice may be ascribed the popular notion that the 
advent of comets and eclipses always portend great evils to 
subjects and princes which has caused an infinite waste of 
stout prophesying and prediction to the no small terror of 
nations had the chronologies of helvicus borne the most 
distant approximation to truth borne would have been de 
stroyed some scores of times nor has it been for want of 



 mateeial fallacies b vi 

similar forethought in modern times that paris and london 
have not as often undergone the same fate the marvel 
however is not that direful mortalities and plague or the 
death of some great potentate happen to coincide with the 
arrival of a comet or an eclipse but that they fall out so 
often without them for such celestial phenomena come 
round so frequently that we are inclined to suspect by the 
laws of chance that wars and pestilence should be oftener 
associated with them moreover there is no reason why 
causes so general and removed as these should have any con 
siderable effect on the earth or act at one point more than 
another or threaten a king rather than a tobacconist 

with the latter class of groundless assumptions may be 
ranked the inclination to take refuge in omens and au 
guries as exponents of the future which is so prevalent 
among the inferior orders of our day and which exercised 
so potent an influence over the destinies of the ancient 
empires even dr johnson would not go abroad on fri 
day through a preexisting notion that he must encounter 
misfortune and we all know that no italian host will 
dine thirteen together or sit down with a party of eleven 
if an ancient general missed his footing in landing on any 
expedition the omen told so fearfully on the courage of the 
soldiers that the chances of his success were consider 
ably diminished hence caesar who was much in advance 
of his time in all respects on accidentally stumbling in effect 
ing an embarkation on the african coast had the presence of 
mind to convert the direful presage into a favourable one by 
exclaiming africa i embrace thee frequently the omen 
took the form of a lucky or unlucky name which the gods 
were supposed to send in prognostication of a future event 
thus the greeks as herodotus tells us were encouraged in 
their enterprise on then way to mycale by the arrival of a 
deputation from lamos from the fact that one of the indi 
viduals comprising it was called hegisistratus or the leader 
of armies 

another fallacy no less generally diffused may be noticed in 
the practice of blending our own inferences with descriptions 
of what we have seen so as to confound the conclusions 

 what cervantes did for the old romancers dean swift accom 
plished for this class of propheciers none have survived the renowned

drawn from fact with actual observation thus it was stoutly 
maintained by the anticopernicans that the system of 
the danish astronomer could not be true because they saw 
the sun rise and set the stars revolve in circles round the 
pole and they felt the earth to remain immoveable under their 
feet but we now know that their alleged experience con 
sisted entirely of inferences from a set of phenomena equally 
reconcileable both with the ptolemaic system and with that 
against which they objected to the same absence of ability 
to discriminate between inference and the perception on which 
inference is grounded may be attributed many of the marvel 
lous stories by which posterity is astounded and amused a 
wandering meteor in a churchyard is sufficient to call up in 
the mind of a rustic the presence of a supernatural visitor 
nor could many observant travellers of antiquity get rid of 
the impression derived from the sight of some africans in a 
state of abject abasement that they belonged to a race of men 
whose heads grew out of their breasts and not from their 
shoulders it is singular to observe how full of conjectural 
inference is the most naked statement that can be wrung 
out of an illiterate person concerning the facts which he saw 
he observes a sheet of lightning strike a house and imme 
diately asseverates his conviction that he saw a bolt drive in 
the wall and not unfrequently goes in search of it every 
word in his description has its surmise and each sentence is 
accompanied with a theory so far as dugald stewart ob 
serves is a plain ungarnished statement of natural fact from 
being a result of nature that the capacity to perform it may 
be regarded as unequivocal evidence of a mind trained by 
long and successful study to the most difficult of all arts the 
interpretation of nature 

a common assumption and one by no means confined to 
vulgar minds is the habit of assigning anything as a cause 
which precedes another or exists in casual connexion with it 
thus because the wealth and power of the country increased 
under the old electoral system and during the continuance 
of the test act it was a standing argument with a large 
portion of the community when the abolition of such things 
were talked of that the prosperity of england was owing to 
their influence eor a similar reason it has been assumed that

the national debt is the cause of the national prosperity 
that because in mediaeval times provisions were more equally 
distributed a low degree of refinement is more favourable 
to the enjoyment of the masses of a community than a high 
state of civilisation in the same manner it was concluded 
that the star which is called the dogstar is the cause of the 
heat which prevails during the time of its ascension and the 
increased mortality which attends its zenith in warm cities 
virgil himself unless his language may be deemed figurative 
was guilty of this fallacy when he wrote 

aut sirius ardor 

ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus segris 
nascitur et laevo contristat lumine ccelum sen x 



now if there were any truth in such conjectures it would 
follow that in those countries where the situation of the star 
above the horizon is most perpendicular heat should be the 
most severely felt but so far is this from being the case that 
its greatest altitude is accompanied with extreme cold sucli 
fallacies though receiving a distinct name in the scholastic 
logic as that of post hoc ergo propter hoc or cum hoc ergo 
propter hoc are only violations of the cautions with which we 
have surrounded the method of agreement and all infractions 
of similar rules with respect to the other methods may be 
regarded as so many distinct fallacies and invested with 
corresponding designations 

 incomplete enumeration 

one of the most common infringements of a principle 
affecting the validity of three of the experimental methods is 
that of incomplete enumeration or of forming a conclusion 
upon the effects or causes of certain phenomena before ex 
amining all the circumstances in connexion with them this 
is the fallacy of inductio per enwnerationem simplicem which 
bacon censured as one of the primary sources of the errors 
which infected the ancient systems of philosophy men 
after observing a few facts grasped at the most sweeping 
generalisations being impatient of the tardy results of passive 
observation and having no idea of the experimental mode of 
investigation hence in everything which concerns natural 

 nov org aph 






c iii incomplete enumeration 

phenomena their theories went astray as they assumed in 
stances which nature either flatly contradicted or failed to 
corroborate by actual fact on such loose inductions bacon 
attempted to throw ridicule by citing the case of an ancient 
sceptic who on being shown by a pagan priest the register 
of those who had discharged the benefactions they had made 
to the gods on condition of their preservation from impend 
ing shipwreck as a proof of the miraculous interposition of 
god drily asked where were the names of those registered 
who after making similar vows had perished 

yet instances of such loose reasoning are by no means 
wanting in modern times even among men of great 
eminence and are to be traced in many of the ordinary 
axioms of civil intercourse locke for example in his 
treatise on education seriously advises all parents and go 
vernors of children to inure them to great hardship dining 
them at all hours in the day bathing them in snow during 
winter and habituating them to long fasts and fatigues 
because he remarks those who have undergone such dis 
cipline never fail to carry a robust body through manhood 
and live to extreme old age but had this distinguished 
metaphysician taken pains to collect the number of those 
who had died under the experiment he would most likely 
have modified his opinion another instance occurs in the 
plausible notion so generally entertained by the old political 
economists that men of lavish expenditure encourage in 
dustry while the mere hoarder confers no benefit on society 
by his gains here then are two sets of phenomena in 
volved one open and palpable to the senses while the other 
lies under the surface and cannot be reached unless by a 
penetration which irrespective of sense follows out things to 
their natural results the fallacy consists as most sophisms 
of this kind commonly do in losing sight of the latent effects 
and restricting the generalisation to mere sensible pheno 
mena as if they were the only instances concerned the 
generous expenditure of the liberal is observed to feed 
labour encourage industry and stimulate the arts every 
tradesman flourishes with whom they have connexion and no 
misery is seen at their gates it is however overlooked 

the first paradox was maintained by coleridge the second by 
rousseau

that the money of the avaricious as far as the great masses 
of the community are concerned is more usefully employed 
for their savings after passing into the hands of their banker 
or having been invested in the funds is lent to some mer 
chant or manufacturer and employed in hiring spinners and 
weavers or opening some new channel of commercial enter 
prise and thus gives occupation and bread to far more hands 
at one venture than the money of the generous employ 
during the whole of their career but the careless observer 
does not see what becomes of the misers money the 
vulgar impression is that it is locked up in an iron chest 
which is not opened unless at the dictation of stern neces 
sity while the number of flourishing tradesmen that the 
profusion of the liberal feeds is at once evident to the most 
obtuse vision and this in so palpable a manner that no 
one ever thinks of the far greater group of artisans whom 
it might employ in industrial and far more remunerative 
occupations hence comes the prejudice universal previous 
to the time of adam smith and even not yet exploded among 
the majority of the educated classes that prodigality encou 
rages industry and parsimony oppresses it 

 fallacy of false analogies 

analogies whether including similarity of relations or 
resemblance between the properties of objects themselves 
are generally introduced in discourse either for the purpose 
of mere illustration or of moving the intellect to the recep 
tion of certain opinions in the shape of direct evidence or 
by way of argument and illustration combined in the two 
latter cases only it falls under the cognisance of logic the 
former branch of the subject belongs to the rhetorician 

an error in analogical reasoning may occur either in over 
estimating the probative force of the proof or in asserting or 
implying resemblance in points which are essential to the 
argument simply from resemblance in other features which 
are indifferent to it it is to the last case that the fallacy 
in question more particularly applies a common instance 
may be cited in the inference commonly drawn in favour of 
despotic government from the similarity of relation which 
holds between a prince and his subjects and a father and his 

 mills system of logic vol ii p 



c hi false political analogies 

family the common people of every community are always 
in a state of infancy and since paternal authority is neces 
sary to promote the happiness of children it is argued that 
the superior sagacity of the prince ought to interpose by 
direct mandate to advance the welfare of his subjects nor 
would the inference be at all unfair if the analogy agreed 
in the essential point which contributes to make paternal 
government the best possible form for the administration of 
private concerns viz the affection of a father for his family 
and his superior wisdom and experience but it is just in 
this very point where it breaks down for experience shows 
that we can never rely upon the existence of these properties 
in political despots evil favourites in many cases getting 
between them and their subjects and creating jealousies and 
misunderstandings which involve either one or both in ruin 
were parental management likely to be disordered by similar 
causes the result would be anything but good government 
another instance of this fallacy may be adduced in the 
common opinion that states by the very constitution of 
things have the same periods of infancy manhood and de 
crepitude that are found in the individuals who compose 
them that after the enjoyment of a certain amount of 
vigorous action decay must stamp its furrows upon empire 
just as it writes its wrinkles on the human body loose 
generalisations of this sort from history may furnish simi 
litudes to illustrate or adorn but if obtruded in the shape of 
analogies from whence to reason they will occasionally be 
found upon examination rather to turn the argument the 
opposite way than make out the conclusion thus in the 
present case the decay of the vital powers in natural bodies 
are traceable to the spontaneous progress of those very 
changes of structure which in their earlier stages constitute 
their growth to maturity while so far is this from being 
the case in political bodies that the advance of those changes 
cannot unless by palpable mismanagement have any effect 
but the still further continuance of growth hence the 
analogy in question establishes an opposite conclusion to 
what it was intended to make out for if it prove any 
thing it certainly is this that bodies politic can only die 
of disease or violent death or in other words that they 
can have no old age

tliis sophism which scholastics termed a non tali pro tali 
is generally allied with that of petitio principii the analogy 
which is the very thing to be proved before it can be ad 
duced in evidence being first assumed and argued from as if 
universally admitted in this form it is frequently used to 
throw ridicule upon an opponents reasoning when he has in 
cautiously let slip one or two loose expressions which admit 
of being illustrated by a burlesque parallelism a ludicrous 
example of the fallacy in this guise may be found in the 
parliamentary debate on unlawful societies in ireland which 
took place in true philosophy mr mackintosh 
had said in alluding to the word hate applied by the catholic 
association to the orangemen of ireland true philosophy 
will always contrive to lead men to virtue by the instru 
mentality of their conflicting vices the virtues where 
more than one exist live in harmony together but the 
vices bear a mortal antipathy to each other and furnish to 
the moral engineer the power by which he can keep them 
under control admirable replied mr canning but 
the poor man who has but one vice must be in a very poor way 
no fulcrum no moral power for effecting his cure whereas 
his more fortunate neighbour who has more vices than one 
in his composition is in a very fair way indeed of becoming 
an honest member of society how would the honourable 
gentleman like to have this doctrine introduced into his 
domestic establishment if i had a drunkard in my house 
hold and dismissed him on account of this fault it would be 
totally out of my power to recommend him to the honour 
able gentleman but if i had the good fortune to discover 
he was also a thief might i not with a safe conscience send 
him with an excellent recommendation saying i send you a 
man whom i know is a drunkard but whom i am happy to 
inform you is also a thief you cannot do better than employ 
him you will make his drunkenness counteract his thieving 
and bring him out of the conflict a very moral personage 
this felicitous exaggeration is founded on a misconception 
of the word vice confounding it with crime and then se 
lecting two cases which instead of being conflicting are in 
reality accessory to each other it may be remarked that 
the most brilliant raillery of this logical statesman may be 
traced to a dexterous employment of analogical fallacies 
 hansard 



c iii false philosophical analogies 

there is no more effective weapon in dispute than the fallacy 
of a non tali pro tali sharpened with an ironical edge 

under this head may be classed those fanciful analogies 
upon which many of the ancients founded physical theories 
and which have drawn some of the moderns into inferences 
quite at war with common sense thus pythagoras finding 
that the relative distances of the planets bore an exact pro 
portion to the divisions of the monochord concluded that 
the action of these bodies in their orbitual motion gave rise 
to the fictitious music of the spheres as if the melody of 
the harp entirely depended on the proportion of certain dis 
tances between the strings and not in the least on the sound 
ingboard or wires of the instrument it has been similarly 
held that because certain combinations of numbers prevailed 
in some natural phenomena they must run through the whole 
of nature as that there must be four elements since there 
are only four possible combinations of hot and cold wet and 
dry that there must be seven planets because there were 
seven metals and even because there were seven days in the 
week kepler himself limited the number to six simply 
because there were only five regular solids besides six 
was a perfect number that is equal to all its factors viz 
 or which was an additional reason why 
there must be exactly six planets the pythagorians in a 
similar way were unanimous in thinking that the decimal 
number as it surpassed most others in perfection must be 
found in every celestial combination and being acquainted 
with only nine heavenly bodies to make up the enumeration 
stoutly maintained that there was an antichthon or counter 
earth on the other side of the sun invisible to us even huy

gens was persuaded that when the number of the heavenly 
bodies had reached twelve that further lookout was useless 
even divine power could not go beyond that sacred number 
of a similar kind was the assumption of the ancients that 
because nature in many objects realised their abstract ideas 
of perfection that a similar adherence to the most perfect 
imaginable entities ought to pervade the entire universe 
this was a most convenient principle which dispensed with 
all examination of instances and enabled them to come to a 
conclusion upon the laws of any natural phenomenon with 
little expenditure of thought thus if any action of nature 
was to be investigated the ancients had only to ask them 
selves in how many possible ways a thing could be brought 
about and select the most perfect as the sure course which 
nature followed for instance because the heavenly bodies 
were perfect they must move in circles and that with uniform 
motion for irregularity of movement would be censurable in 
men and could not be tolerated in the celestial regions nor 
was the force of such reasoning lost upon some of the moderns 
for the copernicans alleged in favour of their system that it 
placed fire in the centre of the universe the only position which 
the noblest element could consistently occupy in conformity 
with that precedence given to dignity and those customary 
rules of etiquette which prevailed in other parts of the universe 

 petitio principii 

the fallacy of petitio principii or begging the question 
consists either in arguing in a circle or assuming a premiss 
which unfairly implies the conclusion the theologian would 
furnish an instance of the first were he to prove the au 
thority of the church from scripture and the inspiration of 
scripture from the authority of the church to prove the 
existence of god on the same authority or to argue that a 
government was good because we ought to support it would 
afford an extreme instance of the second 

notwithstanding aristotle is very circumstantial in the 
description of this fallacy no philosopher fell so frequently 
into it as himself as an instance of his performances in 
this way we may adduce his proof of the earth being the 
central spot of the universe 

 arist de soph elenc cap xxvil 



c iii fallacies of phbenology 

the nature of heavy things is to tend to the centre of the 

universe and of light things to fly off from it 
but experience proves that heavy things tend towards 

the centre of the earth and that light things go off 

from it 
therefore the centre of the earth is the same as the 

centre of the universe 

it is clear that heavy things tend towards the centre of 
the earth but how could aristotle deduce from this fact that 
they tend to the centre of the universe unless by assuming 
in the major that the two centres are identical which is the 
very thing he had to prove 

there is no fallacy in the category which is apt to put on 
more disguises and to hoodwink men more readily into false 
principles or to present them with more plausible reasons 
for their errors than the assumption of the thing in dispute 
sometimes it appears in support of a bad generalisation to 
explain away the outstanding exceptions which conflict with 
the theory thus when it was objected to the psychological 
system of grail and sphurzheim that voltaire if the phreno 
logical busts were accurate had the organ of veneration very 
large it was alleged by the phrenologists that the reverence 
of that philosopher for the deity was so great that he scouted 
all existing forms of worship simply because they fell below 
his idea of the majestic and sublime nature of that worship 
which befitted so great a being goethes deficiency in 
ideality and mozarts want of harmonic perception when 
judged by the phrenological standard were accounted for in 
a similar manner these individuals had the organs very large 
but owing to the casual thinness of the plates of the skull and 
the transparent tenuity of the muscle at that particular spot 
the organ did not protrude on the upper surface it is ob 
vious that such a convenient system of answering objections 
amounted to this the system of phrenology is true there 
fore no exceptions to the theory exist which cannot be 
rationally accounted for and proved to accord with it which 
is one of the most glaring instances of reasoning in a circle 
that the vagaries of philosophy afford 

 these instances do not invalidate the entire system but only the 
hasty generalisations which led its framers in a night and a day to 
assign to every inch of the cerebrum the precise feeling and faculty of 
which it was the organ the tripartite division of the brain which this 



 mateeial fallacies b vi 

occasionally this fallacy comes before us in the shape of 
mistaking a sign of a thing for the thing itself a mistake 
however of so gross a nature that it could not possibly pass 
current unless a large space of time interfered as an agent 
in the deception in past ages for example certain opinions 
were casually associated with peculiar interests and though 
the interests have long been buried with the circumstances 
in which they had their origin yet the opinions are still 
taken as presumptive proof of their tangible existence a 
glaring instance of mistaking a sign from which one might 
fairly infer a certain phenomenon for a cause of it occurred 
in the arguments of those who resisted boman catholic 
claims the greater part of the enactment commonly known 
by the name of the penal laws was framed at the epoch of 
the revolution and was enforced with a view to discover the 
partisans of the pretender the creed of the catholic as 
canning remarked was not his guilt but the means of de 
tecting it the creed was simply a sign or badge of those 
who had a leaning to a prince outlawed by the constitution 
but to uphold the penal laws after the attachment had ex 
pired and the political danger passed away was as if a 
magistrate having received information that a murder had 
been committed by a man who wore spectacles and a wig 
and having apprehended a man distinguished by these ap 
pendages should upon its being ascertained that no murder 
was committed still refuse to relinquish his man persisting 
that the spectacles and the wig were conclusive evidence of the 
murder all believers in transubstantiation being suspected 
of an attachment which the law deemed treasonable to the 
possessor of the throne their creed was taken as a certain 
badge of the treason and exposed its professors to severe 
punishment but when the foreign attachment with the 
exiled family had ceased the catholic was punished for be 
lieving in transubstantiation 

one of the most notable disguises which this fallacy puts 
on is to assign as the original cause of a thing in dispute an 
eifect or collateral consequence of the very principle which is 
sought to be explained away by such a procedure gibbon 
endeavours to undermine that part of the evidence adduced 

system assumes cannot we think be doubted but then it had been 
pointed out long before by galen and was a favourite theory of hip 
pocrates 



c iii begging the question 

to prove the divine origin of christianity which is derived 
from the marvellous speed with which it subjected the world 
to its tenets we need no miraculous interposition argues 
the historian to account for what is fully explainable by 
human agency and he immediately collects under distinct 
heads the causes which had conjointly operated to the wild 
fire spread of the christian doctrine the principal of these 
are the pure lives of its professors the inflexible firmness 
with which they adhered to their principles despite of rack 
gaol and all the horrid instruments of death the zeal they 
manifested in the propagation of their doctrines and the 
subserviency of all other views to that end the social bond 
of brotherhood perpetuated among their members and the 
regularities of daily worship but gibbon forgot in stating 
these and similar reasons as natural agents in the spread of 
christianity that he was assuming the very thing in dispute 
it is obvious that the features he alleged so far from being 
natural were about the most startling phenomena that could 
present themselves in a corrupt state of society corroded by 
moral pestilence of every kind so that his pretended proof 
leaves the swift propagation of christianity quite as in 
explicable on human grounds as it was before this kind of 
explanation is not a whit better than the light let in upon 
the foundations of the earth by the cosmogony of the indians 
 the world rests upon an elephant and the elephant upon a 
tortoise say the brahmins but then what does the tor 
toise rest upon 

a similar instance of this fallacy in its most concealed 
guise is presented in the reasoning by which hobbes and 
eousseau rest the mutual obligations of members of a civil 
community upon a supposed social compact apart from all 
motives of utility and interest according to the latter 
sovereigns are compelled to provide for the welfare of their 
subjects and subjects are bound to maintain dutiful allegiance 
to their sovereigns by the terms of a contract entered into by 
their barbarous progenitors in renouncing savage life and 
agreeing to establish a political society in the same manner 
hobbes throughout his leviathan deduces with elaborate 
skill the obligations which men are under to obey even the 
most despotic mandates of their rulers from a promise made 
by their ancestors at the foundations of society to leave their 
 decline and fall eh xvi 



 material fallacies b vi 

destinies in their hands a great deal of good ingenuity 
however might have been spared by these philosophers had 
they reflected that even if the compact had been drawn out 
in precise terms and the document on which it was written 
hermetically sealed and transmitted to future generations it 
could only have bound the race of men who subscribed it 
in no further case could it have held without the admission 
of the very principle of expediency and interest they discarded 
as a ground of obligation thus we are forced back by the 
conclusion they adopted to the enunciation of the operating 
motive their reasoning endeavoured to exclude to have 
established that conclusion they should have proved not 
only that a social compact did exist but that it was an all 
sufficient ground to link generations of men together in sup 
port of the same institutions and the same line of policy 
but they assumed this which was the radical point in the 
argument and consequently proved nothing 

occasionally this fallacy masks itself in mere forms of 
expression either assigning as a reason for a thing expressed 
in the abstract the same thing restated in the concrete or 
making the concrete statement first and then alleging as proof 
the same thing expressed in a concrete form thus the load 
stone attracts amber by reason of its magnetic virtue the 
poppy has a soporific virtue because it lulls to sleep these 
sort of pretended explanations though ungallantly termed 
ladies reasons are by no means confined to the gentler sex 
the gravest philosophers have dealt in them and none per 
haps so much as the stagyrite himself the english lan 
guage on account of the diverse character of its origin which 
has crowded it with words nearly synonymous in meaning 
but widely different in expression is peculiarly suitable to this 
form of begging the question for a sophist can if he chooses 
bring forward a proposition expressed in words of saxon 
origin and pretend to prove it by giving utterance to the 
very same sentiment in language of norman derivation or 
vice versa this is the common mode of reasoning adopted 
by a peculiar class of political speakers the measure 
under consideration is the best fitted to meet the circum 
stances of the case saxon propos because it provides for 
all the exigencies that can be supposed to be involved in the

true is the saying of hobbes that words are the counters of

the reader must be on his guard against what bentham 
termed begging question appellatives which assume the 
question under the guise of stating it thus were a person 
to argue that because liberal institutions were beneficial to 
the country that a whig government ought to be preferred 
he would assume the point in dispute by the use of the word 
liberal the connexion of which term with such institutions 
being the very matter which requires proof instances of 
this kind of begging the question are presented in all dis 
cussions in which words of a laudatory or a vituperative 
character are used for instance the opponents of the 
recent establishment of the roman catholic hierarchy in 
these dominions in all their arguments on the subject set 
out with the assumption of the act being an aggression and 
thence proceeded to show it was a wanton outrage on the 
feelings of the country whether right or wrong elaborate 
reasoning on the point might have been dispensed with for 
the conclusion was palpably begged in the statement of the 
premiss 

 ignoratio elenchi 

the concluding fallacy we have to advert to is called by 
aristotle ignoratio elencm or ignorance of the contradictory 
of an opponents assertion which we fall into when instead 
of proving the contradictory or elenchus of our adversarys 
proposition we attempt to establish something else re 
sembling it but as it is substantially the same thing to 
prove what was not denied as to disprove what was not as 
serted the fallacy may be employed for the apparent esta 
blishment of our own proposition as well as for the feigned 
refutation of that of an opponents though the stagyrite 
is as carefully minute in his description of this fallacy as of 
the last his own reasonings will afford not the least striking 
specimens of its practice thus he assumes that parmenides 
and melissus admitted only a single principle of all things 
as if they had understood by this principle that of which 

 the phrases in question are selected from hansard every par 
liamentary debate affords many choice specimens of similar inanities 
 de soph elen c v 



 material fallacies b vi 

all things are composed and refutes them on that ground but 
his reasoning was nothing to the purpose since they meant 
the single and unique principle from which all things have 
derived their origin which is god in like manner he 
attributed to his predecessors ignorance of the principle of 
privation viz that a thing could not exist before it was made 
and treated them as clowns and fools for not employing 
it in the explanation of natural phenomena whereas no 
one could be ignorant of so palpable a truth and he must 
have been blind indeed who could have expected it to unlock 
for him the least of the mysteries of nature 

this is the standing sophism of polemical writers and 
accompanies all controversy which is much connected with 
the passions or which engages the attention of an overheated 
crowd of disputants the field of debate is so large that 
the combatants either join issue on the wrong points or do 
not join issue at all one goes to the east another to the 
west one loses the principle in dispute and wanders amidst 
a crowd of irrelevant details one mistakes contraries for 
contradictories another particulars for universals and after 
many hours storm they know not what they have been dis 
cussing one is above another below another at the side 
each either making out a case which his adversary admits or 
pursuing a line of argument which when fully established 
has not the slightest bearing on the point in dispute one 
tugs at a word or similitude or takes up a collateral pro 
position having no essential connexion with the main argu 
ment and overthrowing that makes his pretended triumph 
resound over the field another being rather shattered by 
reasons appeals to the prejudices of his auditory and over 
whelming his more rational antagonist with ridicule and 
abuse comes off the apparent victor of the contest 

 hence it is not unusual after a protracted debate in the house of 
commons for the cooler thinkers to preface their observations with re 
minding the house of the real nature of the point on which they are to 
join issue and the longer the subject in question has been under the 
consideration of the house the greater the necessity has appeared for 
these premonitory exordiums the same precaution is generally taken 
by judges in summing up after trials of protracted length ben 

jonson satirically expressed the vain disputes of a certain class of 
divines by inigo lanthorne disputing with his puppet in bartholomew 
fair it is so it is not so it is so it is not so c the majority 
of theological disputes we fear practically amount to the same result 



c iii forms of ieeelevant conclusion 

the various kinds of irrelevant conclusions contained in 
the above description have distinct names assigned to them 
by logicians according to the matter they embrace thus 
all unfair use of personal opinions argumentum ad tiomi 
nem of popular prejudices argumentum ad populutn and 
respected authorities argumentum ad verecundiam are 
classed under the head of the fallacy of appeals to the 
passions as attempts to decide the question on other 
grounds than the reason of the thing argumentum ad rein 
or than that of the dispassionate exercise of the individual 
judgment argumentum ad judicium it is not that such 
appeals are not allowed but that more should be built upon 
them than what the circumstances of the case necessarily 
warrant for instance were we to prove from the peculiar 
circumstances character or avowed opinions of an individual 
that he was bound in consistency to admit a certain con 
clusion and thence to argue that the proposition was true 
we should seek to establish a relative and particular conclu 
sion for one absolute and general and thus be guilty of 
irrelevant inference or should we attach more than probable 
weight to the argument that a certain course was the best to 
pursue under the circumstances simply because a certain 
authority had recommended its adoption we should fall into 
the same fallacy by mistaking a relative for an absolute degree 
of certainty it is however often legitimate and even neces 
sary to use such arguments in order to silence those who will 
not yield to fair argument or to convince those whose weak 
ness and prejudice will not allow them to assign to any reason 
its true weight with this view jesus christ silenced the 
cavils of the jews when they reproached him with healing on 
the sabbath by citing the parallel case of drawing out a beast 
from a pit on the same day which none of them would have 
deemed sinful the argument ad jiominem however was 
not pressed further by our lord than to convict his objectors 
of gross inconsistency 

another form of this fallacy is that of shifting ground 
when an adversary after having vainly attempted to maintain 
his position covertly exchanges it for another instead of 
honestly giving up the dispute to this is akin the fallacy 
of objections by which people conclude that because argu 
ments can be alleged against any plan theory or system 
it ought to be rejected or that it cannot be true when it 



 material fallacies b yt 

ought to be shown in order to warrant them to hold such 
an opinion that the objections against the adoption of the 
thing are stronger and more numerous than those urged 
in its favour this is the main fallacy of sceptics who con 
clude that christianity cannot be true as long as strong 
objections can be urged against any portion of the evidence 
on which it rests and of bigoted antiinnovators who oppose 
all reforms on the ground that no alteration can be pro 
posed against which they cannot urge strong and unanswer 
able objections but did such reasoning hold and men 
choose to delay accepting any proposition until all the ob 
jections that could be brought against it were unequivocally 
disposed of it is obvious that society could not advance a 
step in the way of speculative belief or of useful reforms 

an ordinary case of this fallacy is exhibited when we 
prove only a part of what is required and dwell on that to 
the exclusion of the rest thus if a man is charged with 
an offence and some portion of the evidence adduced against 
him be of equivocal character a skilful advocate will com 
pletely sink the sound part of the allegations and expatiate 
on the others as if they constituted the only proof before 
the court hence in advancing more than can be well 
maintained we expose the entire line of evidence to a com 
plete overthrow for a clever tactician will seize on the weak 
point introduced and by dwelling upon that part of his 
adversarys argument make it appear that it involves the 
whole question at issue and resound his triumph over the field 
as if he had demolished all the outworks of his opponents 
position wo person therefore should lay down a principle 
without guarding or restricting it by modifications since a 
clever antagonist is always sure to avail himself of his neglect 
in this particular by pushing his principle over the boundaries 
of moderation this course is frequently pursued in par 
liamentary rejoinders and frequently afforded canning a 
way to the citadel of his adversary when reason and justice 
had fortified every other path against him there is no 
principle however just in theory however reasonable in 
argument or expedient in practice which is not capable in 
its naked state of being carried to an extreme length or 
represented in so ludicrous a light as to make it shiver in 
the hands of its nunciator as a weapon of reasoning one 
of the most glaring examples of this kind of irrelevant 



 iii the last two fallacies combined 

conclusion occurred in the debate on the institution of a 
commission of inquiry into the state of the universities 
the principal opponent of the ministerial proposition took 
up the ground that government had no right to inquire into 
the state of municipal or corporate bodies a principle of 
which no one can dispute the justice so long as the movements 
of those societies do not interfere with the interests of the 
commonwealth or impede the progress of the community 
matters of course over which the government have complete 
control the defender of the universities however neglected 
so to restrict it and the minister threw ridicule on his op 
ponent by representing many cases in which a wise govern 
ment could not abstain from interfering with corporate 
societies the onus which lay on the minister of proving 
that the universities presented a case for public interference 
was thus lost sight of in the feelings excited by the con 
futation of the principle in the sense to which its propounder 
did not intend it to apply 

with the last form of ignoratio elenchi may be classed 
the common case of substituting a particular for a universal 
conclusion or of proving something to be possible when it 
ought to have been proved highly probable or probable 
when it ought to have been proved necessary or contrary 
instead of contradictory or improbable when it ought to 
have been proved impossible aristotle complains of this 
last branch of the fallacy as giving an undue advantage to 
the respondent many a guilty person owes his acquittal 
to this the jury considering that the evidence brought does 
not demonstrate the absolute impossibility of his innocence 
notwithstanding the chances are innumerable against it 

this fallacy is not unfrequently combined with that of 
getitio principii when the premiss implying the conclusion 
is assumed on the ground of something resembling it having 
been already established an instance of this kind occurs 
in the speech of cleon concerning the mitylenians who urges 
the justice of putting the revolters to death which as dio 
totus a subsequent speaker remarked was nothing at all to 
the purpose since the athenians were not sitting in judgment 
but in deliberation of which the proper end was expediency 
a similar illustration of the hybrid form of this fallacy may 
be seen in the objection urged against a scheme of national 
 rhet b ii thucidydes quoted by dr whately

education which assumes that the humbler classes if pro 
perly instructed would not submit to the low drudgery of 
their station from the fact that those few at present who 
scrape together a little knowledge are apt to think them 
selves gentlemen and become discontented with their posi 
tion now the force of the argument rests on the perfect 
similitude between the two cases which is most gratuitously 
assumed for when education is universal it must cease to 
be a distinction which as archbishop whately remarks is 
most likely the very circumstance which renders such indi 
viduals too proud for their employment 

the combination of these two fallacies is very usual in 
parliamentary debates and cannings speeches afford several 
instances of then employment and detection one of the 
most striking of the latter will be found in his reply to 
mr perceval in the debate on horners resolutions which 
emanated from the bullion committee of that states 
man having referred to the continuance of our triumphs in 
the peninsula and our conflicts with napoleon as a reason 
for perpetuating an exclusive papercurrency mr canning 
replied i will not pay my right honourable friend so ill a 
compliment as to suppose that he is not himself perfectly 
aware that in thus shaping his argument he has in fact rather 
assumed or omitted the question in dispute the question 
is not whether we shall continue the war in the peninsula 
with all our heart who doubts who dissuades that deter 
mination that point might have been assumed without 
hazard of contradiction but my right honourable friend 
argues that point as if it were disputed and assumes without 
argument that which was necessary for him to prove viz 
that to the continuance of the war and our successes in the 
peninsula it is essential that the present system of cur 
rency should remain unchanged just as fairly might i 
assume without argument that a change in our currency is 
necessary to this same purpose of continuing the war and 
then retort upon my right honourable friend his own ex 
postulations against fettering the energies and cramping the 
exertions of the country in either case the point which is 
alone in dispute remains to be decided

modebn schools op logic 

a distinction is sometimes sought to be erected be 
tween the different modern schools of logic as if the 
predominant elements in each contained something neces 
sarily antagonistic to one another thus we find the 
verbal school of logicians including men whose views 
differ so widely as hobbes dr whately and the school 
men set up in antagonism to the sensational or pheno 
menal school which numbers bacon helvetius comte 
and mill among its chief expositors and these again con 
trasted by way of opposition with the conceptualist school 
of logic of which kant is the chief exponent the student 
having been introduced to these different varieties of logical 
sects is told that he can make only one choice and that the 
set of tenets which is pointed out for his acceptance must 
necessarily place him in antagonism with the opposite 
schools 

it must not however be overlooked as the functions of 
words conceptions and things are conjointly admitted in 
every rational system of logic that there is no necessary anta 
gonism between these separate elements in logic further 
indeed than what may arise from the importance of any one 
being so unduly exaggerated as to exclude or unduly inter 
fere with the functions of the others in the inferential process 
each school with the exception of one or two extreme sec 
tions admit that words are only the embodiments of the 
minds conceptions while the latter are only so many ways of 
regarding external phenomena so that there is in reality

nothing to prevent the main body of their individual 
opinions from being collected into one system of logic and 
thus to exclude that sectarianism in this department of 
philosophy which is the disgrace of religion what is there 
in mill beyond his nominalist views which interferes with 
kants logical doctrines as propounded by jahsche or in 
whatelys exposition of the scholastic logic which conflicts 
with either unless matters of metaphysical concernment 
which have no claims to be acknowledged in logic as the 
ground of antagonistic schools mills nominalist views 
would certainly if carried out to their extreme conse 
quences upset the scholastic theory of logic but as a proof 
that he did not consider his purely logical opinions at all 
conflicting with those put forth by that school he refers his 
readers to dr whatelys treatise as containing views in a 
great measure supplementary to his own in eliminating 
therefore in the foregoing treatise the conflicting metaphy 
sical opinions of the different schools of logical writers we 
have found nothing in the body of their logical doctrines 
which refused to combine harmoniously in one system 

in referring however to the extreme sections of some of 
these schools we might find matter to legitimate an opposi 
tion of logical doctrines but this so far from leading 
to the distinction upon which we have animadverted would 
really take it to pieces thus the extreme exponents of the 
verbal school are hobbes and condillac who denying alto 
gether the antithesis between thought and language assert 
the identity of each and make every question purely verbal 
with hobbes logic is only a peculiar kind of mental arith 
metic season is nothing but reckoning that is adding 
and subtracting of the consequences of general names 
agreed upon for the marking and signifying of our thoughts 
logicians he further says add together two names to 
make an affirmative and two affirmatives to make a syllo 
gism and many syllogisms to make a demonstration and 
from the sum or conclusion of a syllogism they subtract one 
proposition to find the other condillac though in other 
terms expresses precisely the same doctrines with him

definition the only weapon in the logical armoury and the 
greatest results to which the most successful scientific re 
searches can lead is a wellassorted language science cest 
une langue bien faite there is nothing however in these 
views even so far as verbal logic is concerned to place them in 
the same category with those entertained by whately and the 
scholastic logicians while the scholastics and their modern 
representatives overstrained at one time the conceptual and 
rational faculties and at another placed too much reliance 
on the powers of language to explain fundamental differences 
of principle they nevertheless admitted the reality of external 
phenomena and the correlative functions of language and 
conception in the elaboration of thought hobbes and con 
dillac on the other hand denied as rigidly the distinction 
between mind and matter and implied that reason was a 
consequence of our bodily organisation and depended on 
speech for its existence they consequently belong to that 
group of logicians who with locke and dugald stewart 
ignore the functions of the school logic as far as proposi 
tions and syllogisms are concerned and as such stand in 
direct opposition to that school of logicians with whom they 
are sometimes classed 

there is notwithstanding among the general body of 
logicians who admit the syllogistic theory with proper 
limitations a tendency to give undue expansion to one ele 
ment in the triad to which we have alluded the a priori 
school placing too much stress either on words or on con 
ceptions while the nominalist branch are too apt to degrade 
the former and place external phenomena in the ascendant 
thus it cannot be denied that one of the chief defects of 
whately s exposition of the aristotelian logic is the attempt 
to seek for the origin of every dispute in verbal equivoca

conventionalisms by which men choose to invest its mys 
terious processes with external embodiment thus in treat 
ing of hypothetical and inductive arguments he compels 
methods of reasoning which when viewed in the thinking 
mind are clearly distinct from the deductive process and 
from each other to bow to an artifice of language and submit 
to the unvarying formula of the deductive syllogism his 
manifest aim is to underrate the number of real questions at 
issue among mankind and to increase in proportion the 
number of verbal differences in dealing with contending 
disputants he either accuses them of an equivocation t e 
that they mean the same thing by different words or use 
the same word to signify distinct things or he looks for 
some formal error in the argument of one of the parties to 
which he assigns the discrepancy rather than refer the cause 
to some broad difference of principle underlying the whole 
discussion in a similar spirit it is the tendency of con 
ceptional writers to confound logic with metaphysics and to 
make both language and external realities submit themselves 
to the domineering influence of mental theories

ries divided the opinions of some of the leading minds of christendom

not be explained away in like manner thus the dispute between the 
spinozists and the christians with respect to the existence of god 
might be resolved into a mere verbal shuffling upon the word deity 
both classes of disputants really admit the same power existing from 
eternity and endued with creative energies the only difference being 
that one call it nature and the other god but what is there in a 
mere nominal discrepancy to keep the spinozists and the christians 
apart so long as they imply in substance the same thing l chre

not as dealing with conceptions but as employed directly 
about things in like manner words are considered as signs 
rather of things than of our conception of them and pro 
positions are treated not as connecting two ideas or concep 
tions but two things the mind is thus thrown on the out 
ward world for the conditions of its laws and is deprived of 
the dignity of independent action which its superior nature 
would lead us to think was its natural prerogative 

there is however no conflicting opposition between the 
main body of the strict logical doctrines of these several 
schools but only in the exaggerated expansion they are apt 
to receive from the hands of zealous partisans

nominalism and realism 

a pew lines of porphyry on the predicables of aristotle 
raising the question long before agitated between the stagy 
rite and plato as to whether universal conceptions or gene 
ral ideas which include classes have any existence out of 
the human mind gave rise to the angry disputes concern 
ing nominalism and realism which disturbed the repose of 
christendom from the eleventh to the fifteenth century and 
which had previously evoked the same stormy discussions 
among the doctors of islam the question both in the 
mussulman and christian camp had assumed a more com 
plicated form from being involved in theological quarrels 
and as long as the most vital dogmas of religion were 
thought to depend on the issue the fire of spiritual zeal in 
vested these debates which almost cotemporaneously excited 
the passions of two hemispheres with an interest to which 
the most absorbing discussions of the present epoch can 
furnish no parallel and which were frequently silenced but 
never suppressed by the mandates of the civil and the 
anathemas of the spiritual authorities 

now when all the smote has been cleared away and the 
question has been again presented free from any adventitious 
element it does not appear to have derived much elucidation 
from the searching investigation of so many learned doctors 
though the inquiry if we take the mussulman abbas into 
account extended over a period of six centuries these 
gentlemen after a fearful waste of time and zeal left the 
question just where they found it with the exception of 
avicenna who is said to have started the doubtful theory of 
conceptualism which abelard and occham had the poor merit 
of transplanting into the christian arena of the dispute 
this theory however though not directly broached by aris 
totle would evidently impress itself on any reader of the pre 



nominalism and realism 

dicables as the very solution of the difficulty which the stagy 
rite had embraced its formal originators have therefore 
little claim to novelty except indeed for the improper use 
to which they applied it in accounting not only for the mode 
in which class notions or general ideas enter into the mind 
but also in confounding this with their absolute existence a 
point which aristotle very properly left undecided 

with regard indeed to the mode in which the mind ac 
quires universals or class ideas philosophers are generally 
united in assigning the process of abstraction which we have 
attempted to explain in the text in every object there is 
always some property analogous to others in surrounding ob 
jects which compel us as it were to generalise in a particular 
way thus we place houses in one class and men in another 
nor are there any people so uncultured as to rank some houses 
and some men in one category because they are red or to con 
found tastes and sounds together because in many cases 
they are accompanied with agreeable sensations in like 
manner the mind traces among classes of phenomena similar 
organisations and properties within them and having formed 
conceptions out of these classes always applies the name wher 
ever it meets with an individual instance of the general pro 
perty such designations have generally led to the classifi 
cations we meet with in zoology and botany where animals 
and plants are ranged into classes to bring out in bold relief 
the most striking differences of their organisation and ac 
cording as such conceptions in the mind are founded upon 
the real properties of external objects and classified accord 
ing to their importance in creation are they to be relied 
upon as correct representations of class properties in nature 
now if creation had a spiritual designer it is impossible to 
resist the conclusion that before he evolved the world 
out of chaos such class properties existed in his mind as 
archetypes or moulds after which the fabric of existing things 
was fashioned to which they correspond if the same 
vertebral column is found in a hundred species of animals 
occasionally joined to large powerful limbs and sometimes to 
small rudimental ones we are compelled upon the christian 
hypothesis of creation to infer that this part of the frame was 
preordained to be the connecting link of these species and 
that in forming a class of vertebrate animals we are seeking 



 appendix to book i 

after a form or idea which existed in the divine mind when 
animals were created universals or class ideas therefore 
may be said in this view to exist without the mind of man in 
as far as they are in another mind the divine mind stampa 
them on material things the human mind reads them there 
the controversy is thus resolved into questions which are 
extrinsic to pure philosophy and would perhaps never have 
arisen had not natural theology been confounded with it 
plato through his love of systemmaking would explain 
everything and regarding nature as a sealed book he 
taught his followers that they might easily put themselves 
in possession of all the truths it contained by a priori spe 
culations on the divine mind in which the original designs 
existed upon which nature had been modelled this 
though to a certain extent true as regards morals and 
aesthetics was absurd as regarded the material creation and 
aristotle very naturally challenged the whole doctrine as 
an assumption in the department of philosophy being an 
attempt to explain what was certain by what was mystical 
and obscure how do these ideas asked the stagyrite exist 
in the divine mind whether as an attribute or a sub 
stance and if the latter as the platonists maintained how 
can the universal exist in the singular again eoscelin 
and the scholastic nominalists required to know if such 
ideas existed in the divine mind from eternity or were sub 
sequently evolved out of it by an after process of thought 
if the first case other substances existed from eternity 
besides god which is inconsistent with the divine existence 
as a necessary being if the latter the attribute of his im 
mutability was set aside again must there be an idea for 
every sensible object if so before socrates could be born 
there must have been an eternal idea of socrates which 
would lead to a multiplication of ideas too great even for the 
imagination to grasp then there arose the multifarious 
questions concerning the mode by which they entered into 
the mind and how they became connected with the things 
to which they belonged to say that the things participate 
in or are copies of the ideas to which they correspond was 
the nominalists alleged to avoid the difficulty by vague meta 
phorical language in this manner it was by no means diffi 
cult to show that the platonist realism jarred with its own 
hypothesis through the exaggerated view which it took 



nominalism and eealism 

of a principle having its foundation in truth aristotle 
confronted platos doctrine because it closed the era of 
physical inquiry and the scholastic nominalists because it 
clashed with the plainest facts of our own consciousness 
with regard to the mode by which we come into possession 
of class conceptions 

the nominalists however erred by the tendency they 
manifested to push the doctrine concerning class concep 
tions to the other extreme in asserting that these universals 
were mere names and were not only unconnected with any 
class properties in nature but had not even a mental con 
ception to support them but unless general names can be 
assumed at will it must be admitted that they are inseparably 
attached to the general qualities which they connote be 
tween the individual object and the general name we must 
insert the notions for which the name stands as between 
socrates and the name man there intervenes the mental 
notion of the properties which make man nominalism 
thus in its strict sense is indefensible and those who held it 
deserve the censures which were heaped upon them as the 
virtual destroyers of philosophy their theory tends to re 
present the operation of thought as purely mechanical and 
to invert the obvious facts of the case by making reason a 
function of language instead of viewing language as a con 
sequence of reasoning 

to escape the absurdities of the ultranominalist theory 
abelard and subsequently occham alleged that general 
names signify general notions dependent on the abstracting 
powers of the mind but though independent of single ob 
jects without any real substantial entity corresponding to 
them in nature they made no distinctions between moral 
and physical notions or attempted to explain how we obtain 
the general ideas of goodness virtue and beauty from the 
faint exemplars of surrounding objects nor did they attempt 
to reconcile their theory with the existence of the divine mind 
or the christian hypothesis of creation this theory of univer 
sals which is called conceptualism is therefore open to grave 
objections even so far as the mode is concerned by which 
the mind comes into possession of general notions it only 
accounts for those which are derived from physical creation 
while if followed out to its extreme consequences it would 
strip that creation of an intelligent artificer 



 appendix to book i 

in rejecting however the nominalist view of universals 
both in its ultra and moderate coneeptualist aspect we do 
not venture to recommend the acceptance even of a modified 
view of the realist doctrine on the ground that the claaa 
ideas which the mind abstracts from physical objects must 
in the present state of science be correct representations 
either of the primary ideas in the divine mind or of their 
correlative properties in nature the process by which the 
mind seeks to attain these universals often leads to erroneous 
results and even when we attempt to arrange them in 
subordination to each other in few cases can we positively 
assert that the arrangement is a correct expression of their 
gradation in nature viewed as a statement of abstract truth 
if the zoological system of linnaeus was right that of cuvier 
is wrong only when we are assured on the best evidence 
that we have attained to the real nature of things and under 
stand their relative positions in the scale of creation can we 
rely on the validity of our class terms as correct exponents 
of natural universals until we are certain that our class 
conceptions have reached this point of accuracy they will 
only stand as symbols of a provisional classification which 
greater research or more skilful analogies may at any mo 
ment supersede 

in summing up this important controversy we may take 
as far as regards morals and aesthetics the platonic theory of 
universals to be in the main correct while in relation to 
physical truths we must accept such universals as purely 
conceptual which simply correspond to artificial systems of no 
menclature as for instance the linnsean system of botany 
or those of whose correspondence to the actual order of 
things in the external world we have no direct certainty 
with respect to those general conceptions which may be 
fairly relied upon as correct exponents of outward realities 
they may be regarded in the platonic sense as copies of the 
designs existing in the divine mind at the period of creation 
while the coneeptualist view must be adopted with reference 
to their origin in the human mind from an analysis of things 
the ultranominalist account of universals we discard alto 
gether and place the correct theory in a combination of 
abelards views with platonic realism

categories in logic 

chapteb ii 
the categories of aristotle 

these categories have been cited in the text as an example 
of correct division and also as an appendage to that part of 
the aristotelian logic which refers to the hunting out of 
genera and proximate species in the process of definition 
they are however in a practical system of logic of no real 
value and were very properly banished by arnauld to meta 
physics 

some dispute has arisen whether the categories referred 
to things to words or to conceptions and according as 
they have been deemed a division of one of these three 
subjects they have been exposed to much criticism chre 
tien asserts that the ten predicaments are purely an 
analysis of the leading parts of speech and certain modifica 
tions of them and endeavours to point out the mode in 
which they might have been obtained by any philosophical 
grammarian as such he allows the correctness of the 
division but questions their utility beyond the specimen 
they afford of subtile analysis kant on the other hand 
accepts the predicaments in an exclusive sense as a division 
of the conceptions which dwell in the pure understanding 
and endeavoured to make it more complete by the addition 
of postpredicaments or five supplementary categories it 
was not difficult in this erroneous view of the case to cavil 
with the aristotelian division as blending empirical and 
deduced conceptions viz motion action and passion with 
primary notions and also to show by extending the term 
conception to mere subjective conditions of thought that 
there were many such conceptions not even implied in the 
predicaments of the stagyrite kant on these grounds sub 
sequently substituted for the old list of predicaments and 
postpredicaments a new division of categories viz unity 
plurality totality affirmation negation limitation inde 
pendence dependence interdependence actuality possi 
bility and necessity which he defined as the subjective 
conditions of thinking or the rules which the understanding

foregoing all the given diversity of consciousness lays at the 
foundation of nature by means of its own essential laws 

the predicaments of aristotle have again been accused of 
incorrectness on the ground of being strictly a division of 
things in this light mill fairly shows that they are open 
to a charge of crossdivision quality and relation for in 
stance running into each other in the case of habit and 
position falling under relation as a species under a genus 
mr mill then proceeds to state his own categories of all 
nameable things in the following order st peelings or 
states of consciousness nd minds which experience these 
feelings rd bodies or external objects which excite certain 
classes of these feelings together with the powers or pro 
perties whereby they excite them and th the successions 
and coexistences the likenesses and unlikenesses between 
feelings and states of consciousness 

aristotles categories however are not to be judged ex 
clusively on any of the grounds above enumerated being 
intended as mr mill indeed admits as an enumeration of 
the most extensive conceptions or summa genera into which 
all things capable of being named can be distributed they 
are not names of things or of words or of conceptions apart 
from each other but simply a division of things into the 
most extensive conceptions that the mind is capable of dis 
tributing them and as such correspond of course to the 
natural divisions of language which is framed on the model 
of those conceptions kants view of the aristotelian cate 
gories was therefore entirely a mistaken one mr mill 
notwithstanding his correctness with respect to the point of 
view in which the predicaments are to be considered is we 
think in error as respects the superiority of his own 
categories in a logical system waiving the objection that 
it confines spiritual existence to human minds and there 
fore does not seem exhaustive the generalisations which it 
involves cannot be assumed on mr mills own principles 
to be correct till inductive science has worked its way up 
to the boundaries of knowledge and thrown aside the curtain 
which hides the universal frame of things in a word as 
logical it is out of place as a correct distribution of name 
able things even shutting out the spiritual world its correct 
ness and usefulness are only conjectural 



categobies in logic 

of the list of categories already given to the world the 
peripatetic is the only one which aims at baking a distinct 
place in logical science and so far indeed as the scholastic 
conception of this science is concerned it will be found to 
answer the requirements of its framer being devised at a 
period when nothing beyond language was very philosophi 
cally elaborated it may be faulty in giving too great a pre 
ponderance to the verbal element but we must not lose 
sight of the fact that considering the narrowness of the 
human faculties no division of this kind which aims at the 
distribution of every nameable thing under the highest heads 
in which they are conceived by divine intelligence can 
possibly be devised without being open to many objections 
aristotles attempt to say the least of it is the most perfect 
that has been made all the others seem to be quite inde 
pendent of logic being conceived more or less in reference to 
the metaphysical system adopted by their framers the 
pythagorian platonic and stoic schools among the greeks 
had each its corresponding tables and in modern times the 
word has come to denote the distinctive classification of each 
metaphysician whatsoever his system leads him to discuss 
or howsoever he divides it thus reid tells us that the 
categories of locke are three substance modes and eela 
tions and those of hume two ideas and impressions and 
he adds amusingly enough that an excellent mathematician 
of his day desired to substitute for the peripatetic predica 
ments two only viz data and qusita

use of language in logic 

some confusion has originated in former treatises from 
the absence of a distinct conception with regard to the rela 
tion of language to thought in logic dr whately for ex 
ample has defined logic as the art of employing language 
properly for the purposes of reasoning and thus implied 
either that thought and language are invariably united or 
that the mere words by which the results and the process of 
inference are expressed form the substantial element about 



 appendix to book i 

which the science is employed the latter is to mistake the 
shadow for the substance the former involves a false meta 
physical hypothesis 

even taking the high ground of the scripture theory in its 
literal sense with regard to the origin of language it implies 
no more than that man was endowed with the power of 
framing words to correspond to his conceptions as such 
it dissevers thought and language and allows the latter no 
other value than as its vehicle and exponent there is how 
ever a wide school principally consisting of high church 
divines who believe that words are something more than 
mere signs who stoutly contend that they are vital powers 
and seem inclined to reverse the ingenious remark of hobbes 
that words are the counters of wise men but the money of 
fools we have notwithstanding the crowd of assertions in 
favour of this view met with nothing like a single reason 
in its favour that words may be employed as strong 
impulsive forces may be easily admitted by any one who 
has observed the power which the skilful rhetorician ex 
ercises over the crowd or the influence of language in the 
advancement or deterioration of society but that words 
derive this power from any other source than their sym 
bolical character no one can maintain with even the sem 
blance of argument if words are used as the signs of things 
and conceptions it is very natural they should as bacon 
alleges react upon the intellect and limit and in some 
measure control its operations but from this surely nothing 
can be inferred except the liability with certain minds from 
the constant association of language with thought to mistake 
words for realities and believe that they command language 
when in reality language commands them 

 gen ii trench expressly does so and goes out of his way 
to call the malmesbury philosopher one of englands false prophets 
study of words p rd ed there is a sense of reality about 
children which makes them rejoice to find there is a reality about 
words ibid their reality however is derivative and not primary 
there is nothing in trenchs valuable treatise whichreally conflicts with 
hobbess views unless his uncharitable expression and the reversal of 
hobbess brilliant aphorism credunt enim homines rationem 

suam verbis imperare sed fit etiam ut verba vim suam super intel

use of jiangtrage ut logic 

words being simply instrumental in aiding the mind to 
travel much further by means of general terms than it could 
without their aid can only be considered in logic so far as 
their employment either tends to assist or to defeat the 
process of inference and as with instruments of another 
kind our care should be that they faithfully transmit the 
properties they were intended to convey and not palter 
with us in a double sense or be allowed to float about 
either with a loose unsettled or inaccurate connotation 



chapter iv 
abuse of general terms 

as an instance of the disputes to which the employment 
of general terms may give rise in fundamental questions of 
law or government trench adduces the latin word bene 
ficium this word it appears anciently implied either benefit 
or benefice either we suppose on account of the advantages 
that accrued to the minister from the possession of the 
revenues or the benefits that were believed to flow to the 
people from his pastoral functions and is used in both senses 
by wicliff in his translation of the bible tim vi as 
the term however was early connected with the conflicting 
claims of imperial and priestly jurisdiction it was not long be 
fore its bifold signification was turned to account pope 
adrian iv writing to the emperor frederic i against cer 
tain lay encroachments on the spiritual authority reminded 
the emperor that he had placed the imperial crown upon 
his head and would willingly have conferred even greater 
seneficia upon him than this had the word been accepted 
without a remonstrance it might have been afterwards ap 
pealed to as an admission on the part of frederic that he held 
the empire as a feud or fief for beneficiwm was then the 
technical word for this though the meaning has been much 
narrowed since from the pope the very point in dispute 
between them the word however was repelled by the 
emperor whereupon the pope appealed to the etymology 



 appendix to book i 

that beneficium was but bonum factum and protested that he 
meant no more than to remind the emperor of the benefits 
which he had done him and which he would have willingly 
multiplied still more 

chapter iv 
transitive application of words 

the transformation of words from one distinct sense to 
another without either widening or diminishing their appli 
cation may be taken as one of the most general laws of 
language a striking example of it may be adduced in the 
application of the term classics to denote according as the 
object either refers to languages or books those of the highest 
excellence thus when we speak of the classical languages 
we refer exclusively to the greek and latin because these 
tongues have been always considered by europeans as exem 
plars after which they might improve their own in like 
manner we refer to the works of milton or dryden racine 
or boileau as english and french classics the productions 
of these authors being ranked as the best of their kind by the 
general body of their countrymen the word classics or 
classici however was attended at first with a very different 
signification this word was originally applied by the po 
litical economists of rome to designate men who possessed 
the largest income roman society being divided into classes 
according to the amount of property its respective members 
possessed with a view that each might be rated in proportion 
to his ability to contribute towards the expenses of the state 
the individuals in the foremost rank were called classici in 
contradistinction to men of the second third or fourth class 
who are termed infra classem when the roman political 
system was broken up and the term wandered about without 
a meaning it was associated by an obvious analogy with the 
works of the ancient writers since at the time when the 
appellation was bestowed no works were written either in 
the east or the west except in greek and latin and it could 

 we have not verified the accuracy of this statement but give it on 
trenchs authority and almost in his own words study of words 
p rd ed 



changes in the meaning of woeds 

not be considered that the mediaeval writers were able to rival 
the pagans in the use of their own tongue by degrees how 
ever as the barbarous dialects of europe took the form and 
pressure of the ancient languages and men felt sufficient 
confidence in their stability to make them the vehicle of their 
literary bequests to posterity the term classics made another 
leap and is now applied in conjunction with its mediaeval 
signification to designate the best writers in any of the modern 
languages 

as an instance of the disputes to which the transitive 
application of words occasionally give rise we may cite the 
history of the word sacramentum this word is first met with 
in the roman law as signifying a deposit or pledge which 
in certain suits defendant and plaintiff were alike obliged to 
risk upon the condition that the loser of the action should 
forfeit his to the nearest temple hence the name sacra 
mentum or consecrated thing was applied to the property 
thus offered as a guarantee of sincerity we next find the 
word used in connexion with the military oath by which the 
soldiers of the eepublic bound themselves never to desert 
their standards or turn their back upon the enemy from 
being applied to denote the sacredness which the kornaiis 
attached to their military engagements it soon became 
synonymous with any oath whatever 

the early christian writers in appropriating all the terms 
of a solemn or sacred character in the heathen vocabulary 
and applying them to the nascent theology were not always 
careful to avoid a bifold meaning as something peculiarly 
sacred was attached by the ancients to the solemnity of an 
oath the first christians applied the word sacrament to 
designate in particular a class of actions which were also 
deemed of peculiar sanctity in their system and in return 
for which divine grace was communicated to the soul by 
certain ordained ceremonies and solemn engagements were 
entered into by the recipients to continue true to the fulfil 
ment of certain duties but the early christian writers also 
applied the word sacramentum in a loose secondary or 
analogous sense to denote any sacred transaction that had 
some special solemnity or sanctity attached to it as the incar 
nation the lifting up of the brazen serpent the giving of the 
manna which in time led the two senses to become confounded

hence the controversy has arisen how many sacraments 
the early church acknowledged of divine institution the 
catholic stoutly maintains there are seven while the lutheran 
will only admit two explaining away the passages cited 
against him from the early fathers which call matrimony 
extreme unction or confirmation sacraments as so many uses 
of the word in its second signification 



chapter it 
twofold law of the transformation of names 

a crowd of examples might be produced from french or 
any similar treatise in illustration of this law nor is the ob 
servance of the course which words take in obedience to it 
without historical or even moral significance thus with 
regard to the specialisation of words of general meanings to 
denote some peculiar object or function we could not form 
a very favourable idea of roman chastity at the time when 
conciliatrix was employed to designate a female pander or 
of french and english manners from the particular application 
of the word esteem in the reigns of louis xiv and the 
second charles more favourable instances of specialisation 
may be noticed in our day in the use of the word irregular 
to characterise a person of profligate manners or of the 
acceptance of a consideration to signify the receipt of a 
salary this tendency to denote things by words which 
convey the faintest impression of their disagreeable pro 
perties is not confined to the refined classes of society but is 
occasionally apparent among the commonalty as in the appli 
cation of the word lovechild to designate illegitimate 

 trench defends the latter view on the ground of its adaptation to 
the old roman signification the remembrance of the use of sacra 
ment to signify the plighted troth of the boman soldier to his imperator 
was that i think which specially wrought to the adaptation of the 
word to baptism wherein we also with a manifest allusion to this 
oath of theirs pledge ourselves to fight manfully under christs ban 
ner and to continue his faithful soldiers and servants to the end but 
trench forgets that by a similar parity of reasoning confirmation 
ought to be placed in the same category

children or the word tally to a female living with a man 
out of matrimony 

instances of the contrary law of generalisation are still more 
common the word bigot bigote for example from being 
in the spanish language the name for moustache which in 
that country was deemed a mark of resolution and firmness 
came to be employed in this country as a byname for roman 
catholic and on account of the unhappy notoriety of spain 
in religious persecution the term was afterwards extended 
indiscriminately to all those who exhibited any symptoms of 
exclusiveness or of a persecuting spirit in matters of religion 
in like manner the term rivals was originally confined to those 
who dwelt on the opposite banks of the same river from the 
disputes which they had at diiferent periods concerning their 
right to turn off the stream into their own fields or keep the 
sluices open as it suited their convenience prom this the 
term was gradually extended to conflicting claimants of every 
kind and finally included all persons engaged in unfriendly 
competition with each other

primary and secondary intentions analogical use of 
terms 

the first intention of a term is a certain vague and general 
signification of it in contradistinction to one more precise and 
limited which it bears in some particular art or science 
that is called its second intention thus a line expresses 
a certain idea of extension which constitutes its primary sig 
nification and which nearly corresponds with the employment 
of the term in mathematics while in military art it signifies 
a certain form of drawing up ships and troops in geography 
a certain division of the earth in angling a string to catch 
fish these therefore constitute its secondary intention 
the term in each being employed not in its broad naked sig 

 extreme instances of the law of specialisation generally go under 
the name of euphemism hombre de bigote is the spanish for a 

man of resolution and tener bigotei in the same tongue means to stand

nification but expressing something foreign in addition ac 
cording to the purposes for which it is employed 

occasionally words are turned from their primary signifi 
cation and used in an analogical sense as we talk about 
 weighing reasons or when we attribute the sense of sweet 
ness to sounds nor can error arise from this employment of 
terms so long as we do not take the analogy for more than it 
is worth or imagine that things must be similar in themselves 
because they have similar relations to each other but this 
error as we have seen in the word sacrament will sometimes 
happen men confounding the primary with the analogical 
meaning of the term and deeming the one signification in 
many cases of no more importance than the other the same 
destiny has attended the word servant because this word 
was applied to persons under the jewish law whose lives and 
property were completely at the mercy of their masters some 
persons in our day seem inclined from the old word being 
still in use to exact the same peremptory service from those 
avho serve them as if the ancient duty of slaves still attached 
to persons in an analogous position in a similar manner 
because we can hardly speak of the operations of the spirit 
without employing the terms which are commonly used to 
express analogous physical action it has been alleged that 
no such thing as spiritual substance exists and that thought 
must be an attribute of matter or in other words because 
mind and body have similarity of relation they must be iden 
tical 

there are two more classes of words which are apt to intro 
duce confusion as far as an accurate rendering of thought is 
concerned viz those which under one name apply to several 
distinct things and others vulgarly called synonymes which 
while differing slightly from each other are associated with 
one meaning as an example of the first kind we may take 
the word stock which from being anciently the past par 
ticiple of to stick came to designate everything into which 
the idea of fixedness entered in a definite manner thus 
we have live stock the stock of a gun stock in trade 
the stock dove the stock which goes round the neck the 
family stock the village stocks the stocks in the public 
funds the stocks on which ships are built and an infinity of 
other stocks of an analogous kind in like manner we find 



analogical use of teems 

the word post from the latin positus that which is 
 placed applying to a variety of objects into which the idea 
of that participle enters as a military station an office for 
letters a piece of timber placed in the ground and an official 
position the same term is also used in a verbal sense as to 
post a ledger and also adverbially as to travel post 
 post haste c the same variety of meanings occurs 
with the word case and hundreds of other terms in the 
english language 

when the diiference of meaning between the several signi 
fications of one word is not clear great confusion is likely to 
arise from their use thus when we say the rose smells 
sweet i smell the rose the term smell refers to two 
objects widely different in the first sentence we speak of a 
quality in the flower in the second of a certain sensation in 
our minds on this ambiguity have been founded the striking 
paradoxes of those who maintain there is heat in fire and 
no cold in ice in the same manner the term certain as 
used with reference to the state of the speakers mind as i 
am certain of the fact or to denote the accuracy of any in 
telligence points to two different objects and philosophers 
have not been wanting to avail themselves of such equivoca 
tion to deny the existence of certainty altogether 

in guarding against similar ambiguities of speech all lan 
guages are not equally fortunate the greek and the 
german are much more philosophically accurate than the 
latin and the latin in this respect may be said to surpass 
the french italian and spanish while our own language is 
behind each of the latter triad in the same quality however 
much it may surpass them in strength and copiousness of 
diction thus the german takes care in using the same 
word in different senses to make some change in the spelling 
or in the gender of the term or in his mode of forming the 
plural that the meaning may be distinguished in this 
manner we find der band to signify a book diebdnde books 
das band a tie and ribbon die bande ties and die bander 
ribbons in like manner die worte signify spoken words 
and die wdrter written words die strausen mean ostriches 
die strduse bouquets of flowers a similar arrangement oc 
curs in italian to distinguish the primary and analogical 
meaning of words thus lefondamenta means the founda 



 appendix to book i 

tions of a house or material edifice but when applied to the 
first elemeuts of an art or science ifondamenti must be used 
in like manner we have le membra to denote the members of 
the human body and i membri the members of society or of 
any other social corporation the same distinction may be 
traced between the words le frutta and ifrutti le coma and 
i corni and many others the same subtilty of distinction 
is manifest in the employment of the spanish and italian pro 
noun which entirely excludes the possibility of those mis 
takes which sometimes occur in the english use of the same 
article of speech 

in german and greek a systematic order of distinction is 
observed to make words correspond by a little alteration 
generally on the final byllable with all the shades of difference 
in which they can present themselves to the subject mind ac 
cordingly we find a distinction preserved in the two languages 
between the same term used in the concrete and in the ab 
stract and also between the result of an act and the act itself 
so that it would require a person to be in some respects a phi 
losopher to understand their simplest conventionalities thus 
we find in the greek revij the abstract term for art but 
rexvai the concrete name for the exercise of any particular 
art and in german that an action or deed thatigkeit or 
activeness so kenntschaft and kenntniss in like manner 
npasis the doing of anything trpayfm the thing done so 
os and apov xrjis and xxa c in english however 
there is no similar arrangement and we are frequently obliged 
to use the same word in different senses thus learning 
may either mean the act of acquiring knowledge or know 
ledge itself shot the materials of ramming a gun or the 
act of firing it and so with others 

confusion is also apt to rise from the opposite practice of 
using many words to express the same sense especially when 
such terms are on the eve of being desynonymised or when 
the shade of distinction that begins to obtain among them is 
far from being universally acknowledged the english lan 
guage is perhaps more open to confusion of this kind from 
the various elements of foreign words which have become 
amalgamated with it in the course of history and which 
have given it many names for the same thing thus from 
norman latin and greek sources in addition to our native 



wobds neaslt synonymous 

saxon we have shepherd and pastor feeling and sentiment 
handbook and manual love and charity freedom and liberty 
numeration and arithmetic supposition theory and hypo 
thesis almighty and omnipotent unreadable and illegible 
reason and understanding fancy and imagination poetry and 
poesy burdensome and onerous keenness and subtlety and 
so with duplicate verbs to heal and to cure to whiten and 
to blanch to soften and to mollify to cloak and to palliate 
and many others now notwithstanding each of these 
duplicates words were used originally in the same sense they 
have now separated from one another and acquired separate 
meanings to answer the varieties of fresh thoughts and feel 
ings which society acquires in advancing to a high state of 
civilisation hence as this desynonymising process is con 
stantly going on mistakes are apt to arise from the use of 
words in a sense exactly equivalent when a broad distinction 
is acknowledged between them

analysis and synthesis 

what we have advanced on analysis and synthesis in the 
text mainly refers to the applied sciences where it is usual 
when the tentative process of analysis is complete to con 
struct the synthesis by way of verification and also to employ 
the latter method of statement in teaching as more scientific 
and complete analysis however is not always thus subor 
dinate to synthesis as may be shown by any simple instance 
from the analytical mathematics in a common algebraical 
equation one or more unknown quantities are given and the 
consequences are traced backward till those quantities become 
known it is not considered necessary to show by reversing 
the process that the results obtained actually fulfil the con 
ditions which the unknown quantities were assumed to fulfil 
in the original formula 

another instance in which analysis is perfect without any 
corresponding synthesis is found in the ordinary process 
of deliberation which has sometimes gained in consequence 
the name of practical analysis those who deliberately desire 
any object which they have reason to suppose within their 
reach begin by assuming it is attainable by them and then 
proceed to consider on what antecedent conditions the attain 
ment of the object depends and to what conditions these in 
turn are subject thus they continue precisely as in mathe 
matical analysis until they arrive at certain elementary con 
ditions which their own consciousness tells them are within 
their power certain acts of their individual will and the 
natural expression of it in word or deed the analysis is 
perfect when the agent can clearly perceive that all the actions 
or means on which the result depends are fully within his 
power and when he is conscious of the force of his own will 
to bear him through them the analytical process is com 
plete in itself because the subsequent actions which corre 
spond to them do not reverse the order of thought as in cor 



analysis in the aets 

rect synthesis although the result of the actions should 
verify the accuracy of the analysers speculative inferences 

it remains to consider in what mode art avails itself of 
these methods with respect to aesthetics it does not appear 
they have any but a faint application on account of their a 
priori nature and the consequent reverse method of pro 
cedure which obtains in the fine arts in contradistinction to the 
applied sciences it often happens that principles are really 
involved in the works of an artist which the artist himself has 
probably never realised except in their abstract form he 
exemplifies the laws of science not in consequence of any 
particular study of them but in virtue of that taste and keen 
perception of beauty which imagination continually feeds 
within him and which is only casually influenced in the 
highest genius by exterior observation and the study of the 
phenomenal world 

perhaps in this field the most common use of analysis is in 
investigating the causes of defects something offends we 
know not why but in the endeavour to refer it back to 
first principles we shall discover that some rule has been 
transgressed some harmony violated some canon of incon 
sistency broken thus very early attempts at art through 
the want of consistency often fail at the first touch of 
analysis notwithstanding the parts may be right in them 
selves on no possible hypothesis could the whole be true 
the same reason is fatal to the attempt of a chinese artist to 
depict all the six sides of an interior at once and to the con 
ventional egyptian representation of a man in which the 
head body and lower members are depicted in three incom 
patible positions and to the head of minerva on the archaic 
coins of athens in which the full eye which figures appro 
priately in the front face is transferred without modification 
to the profile 

in the earlier stages of the fine arts this seems to be the 
only use of analysis in their most flourishing state there is 
nothing of that doubt and indecision which the analytical 
process implies great works are owing to the magic of 
genius and not to any artificial study of particulars or 
formal process of thought but when invention waxes cold 
and the mind relies less readily on its own resources than 
the imitations of the past then analysis steps in it gives 



 appendix to book iv 

rules according to which the highest processes of genius has 
spontaneously produced certain effects and these rules will 
fall under the leading idea of the art so far as the nature of 
the case admits according to the ordinary methods of science 
these remarks are strictly confined to esthetics including 
not only music painting and poetry but other works of an 
analogous kind which appertain to the highest order of 
genius the case is different with many mechanical arts in 
which an opportunity is afforded for strict consequence in 
the formation of the rules which can be deduced from certain 
empirical principles by means of the laws of space and 
number of this nature are many practical exemplifications 
of the laws of hydraulics and pneumatics and projectiles 
here the synthetical arrangement is more than a form and 
the method of art bycoinciding with its type loses its indi 
viduality and melts into that of applied science

the senses an ultimate source of evidence 

notwithstanding spectres and apparitions are generally 
brought in proof of the reality of sensible impressions they 
are sometimes adduced on the contrary side so that it is in 
some measure necessary to consider them here to complete 
the argument of the text 

if as some contend the senses can convey such delusive 
impressions as to lead persons who are usually accounted 
sane to mistake the figures engendered by their own mind for 
realities and converse with them as creatures of flesh and 
blood why may not the senses generally be labouring under 
a similar delusion and generating around us a world of 
shadows which have no existence out of the mind of the 
fact that the senses have thus grossly imposed upon the 
minds of many there can be no doubt eespectable physicians 
of whose veracity there can be no suspicion have stated 
many striking instances of such deceptions and the victims 
themselves have pined away and in many cases died of the 

 chretien logical method p 



causes of appabitions 

suffering produced by their shadowy tormentors and the in 
ability on their part to get rid of the impression that they 
were something more than mere shadows dr gregory tells 
us of a patient who daily as the evening clock struck six en 
countered a witch in form something like those which are 
said to have greeted macbeth on the heath of pores and 
who was so distressed by the grimaces of his weird visitor 
that he languished and finally died of a broken heart thus 
the duke of olivarez in le sage who was worried to death 
by the presence of an apparition which he fancied always 
pursued him was no imaginary character 

we find another case still more striking vouched for on 
the most indisputable authority in a lawyer who was first 
haunted by a cat which subsequently took the shape of a 
gentleman usher and appeared with cap plume and sword 
like the ghost of beau nash and then denuded itself of 
flesh and clothes altogether taking the form of a skeleton 
the last metamorphosis was fatal to the life of the sufferer 
sir david brewster also narrates a series of remarkable 
apparitions to which a lady of his acquaintance was subject 
sometimes assuming the garb of deceased friends occasionally 
the shape of absent ones and in every instance comporting 
themselves as to speech and behaviour like substantial crea 
tures she encountered her husband in the drawingroom 
and held some moments conversation with him at a time 
when he must have been two hundred miles distant and she 
spoke to friends at her toilette who must have been rotting 
in their shrouds some five years before 

these apparitions would be certainly marvellous and might 
throw grave doubt upon the testimony of the senses if they 
did not admit of lucid explanation but this fortunately is 
not wanting we can not only theoretically account for the 
cause but point out many instances of the cessation of the 
apparitions consequent on its removal spectral illusions 
as dr hibbert has shown are nothing more than ideas or 
the recollected images of the mind which in certain states 
of bodily indisposition have been rendered more vivid than 
actual impressions or to use other words that the pictures 
in the minds are far more vivid than pictures in the bodys 
eye the minds eye may be said to be the bodys eye and

the retina the common tablet on which both classes of im 
pressions are painted and by means of which they receive 
their visual existence according to the same optical laws 

in the healthy state of the mind and the body these two 
classes of impressions on the retina are nicely adjusted the 
mental pictures are transient and feeble and in ordinary 
states never capable of disturbing or effacing the direct 
images of objects the two opposite impressions could not 
coexist the same nervous fibre which is carrying from the 
brain to the retina the figures of the memory could not at 
the same moment be carrying back the impressions of exter 
nal objects from the retina to the brain the direction of the 
minds attention to one of the two classes of impressions 
necessarily produces the extinction of the other hence in 
darkness and solitude when external objects no longer inter 
fere with the pictures of the mind they become more vivid 
and distinct and in the state between waking and sleeping 
the intensity of the impression approaches to that of visible 
objects with studious persons who are much occupied 
with the operations of their own minds the mental pictures 
are much more distinct than in ordinary persons and in the 
midst of abstract thought external objects even cease to make 
any impression on the retina a philosopher in his study 
experiences a temporary deprivation of his senses noises 
and objects are conveyed to his eyes and ears and his nerves 
actually receive the impressions of light sound and touch 
but he fails to realise them now pictures of the mind and 
spectral illusions are equally impressions on the retina only 
differing in vividness and frightful apparitions are nothing 
more than the results of a disordered imagination acting on 
some accidental disarrangement of the vital functions 

the substantial correctness of this reasoning is evident 
from the state of those persons subject to such hallucina 
tions and the disappearance of the malady as soon as they 
returned to a healthy condition thus the crowd of persons 
whom nicholai imagined he saw constantly moving and 
acting in his sight gradually faded away as soon as he sub 
jected himself to a course of medical treatment and the 
ugly spectres with which the bright imagination of tasso 

 a bookseller of berlin who had the courage to lay his case before 
the philosophical society of that capital 



causes of appabitions 

peopled his cell and who sometimes contested with him his 
daily meal grew imperceptibly less palpable as he recovered 
his health and only annoyed him during inveterate periods 
of sickness again the lady whose spectres were recounted 
by sir david brewster convinced herself of their emptiness 
by standing in the positions and sitting in the same chairs 
the apparitions occupied and finding nothing where they 
appeared to stand or sit but vacuity all parity is conse 
quently destroyed between such impressions and those which 
follow from the presence of tangible objects in the external 
world like the ordinary illusions of the visual organ on 
pressing one eye or straining both the apparitions are seen 
doubled which of course could not be had they like sensible 
objects any solid reality they therefore must be classed with 
shadows nor does their relation to that category throw the 
remotest doubt on the reality of the outward phenomenal 
world with which beyond the mere impression they have 
nothing in common

classification and nomenclature 

when we attempt to arrange natural objects in groups 
according as they possess similar properties and again to 
range these groups in regular gradation corresponding to the 
rank which each holds in the department of nature to which 
it belongs the result is a system of classification considering 
the vast number of different objects embraced in each of the 
tripartite divisions of nature and the necessity of having the 
evidence of all brought to bear on scientific inquiry at that 
stage of the proceeding in which their testimony is likely to be 
of any value the importance of such classifications and the 
care with which they should be framed so as to bring not only 
all the properties of the objects they embrace into notice but 
also the causes on which these properties depend cannot be 
too much overrated according indeed as these classifications 
are loosely or accurately framed will the respective sciences to 
which they correspond lag tardily behind or exhibit signs of 
progress when the facts of a case are lucidly and com 
pletely stated a clever judge is not long in coming to a just 
decision when any branch of natural phenomena is ar 
ranged in that form which is best calculated to bring out in 
bold relief all the striking properties it embraces and the 
elements upon which those properties mainly depend for 
their origin and development a sagacious observer seldom 
fails to get into the secret recesses of the phenomena and to 
pounce upon the law 

such classifications have failed hitherto principally from 
their framers selecting arbitrarily some subordinate or non 
essential point of agreement as the basis of their system and 
thus throwing into the same group objects which in the 
general aggregate of their properties present no resemblance 
and into different and remote groups others which have the 
closest similarity thus the linnsean arrangement of plants 
according to the number of stamens and pistils or tourne 
forts system founded on the shape and the division of the 



classification by geoups 

corolla are positively mischievous since they direct the 
attention to those properties in plants which are of the least 
interest and thus hinder the mind from regarding them in 
the groups which have the greatest number of the most 
striking properties in common artificial arrangements of 
this kind hardly deserve the name of scientific classifications 
they are more properly divisions in which the taste of the 
framer or the particular end he may have in view rather than 
the footprints of nature serve as the guiding principle of the 
arrangement 

the classifications by which science is advanced are widely 
different from these instead of agreeing in nothing but 
arbitrary heads from which the most important natural 
relations are rejected these relations themselves are sought 
out and adopted as the basis of the system and every object 
ranged in accordance with them so as to represent the 
various kinds which exist in nature as much as possible in 
the precise order in which they occur and bring into view 
the most distinctive properties they exhibit classifications 
in natural history for example which have any claim to be 
natural are founded upon those distinctions of kind winch 
run throughout nature and which place impassable limits 
between the different groups to which they refer and not 
upon any arbitrary choice of the naturalist these kinds are 
of course determined by the properties which are so funda 
mentally distinct as to interpose an insuperable barrier be 
tween the classes into which they enter and such characters 
are selected to be a mark or type of the kind which point to 
the greatest number of subordinate properties in common 
with each group distinctions of kind however are not 
numerous enough to supply the whole basis of a classifica 
tion very few for instance of the genera of plants or 
even of the families can be pronounced with certainty to be 
kinds the great distinctions of vascular and cellular 
dicotyledonous or exogenous and monocotyledonous or 
endogenous are perhaps differences of kind since the lines 
of demarcation which divide these classes seem to go through 
the whole nature of the plants but the different species of 
a genus or genera of a family usually have in common only 
a limited number of characters a rosa does not seem to 
differ from a kubus or the umbelliferse from the banun 



 appendix to book t 

culacese in much else than the characters botanically as 
signed to those genera or families notwithstanding such 
distinctions are marked out by properties limited in number 
they may be eminently natural provided those properties 
are important and the objects contained in each group 
resemble each other more than they resemble anything which 
is excluded from it but then these lower groups are to be 
arranged into higher classes and made when it is possible to 
correspond to kinds the latter serving as a kind of exemplars 
or types of the subordinate classes which are grouped around 
them 

such arrangements as we have described have reference to 
distinct compartments of natural history there are how 
ever other classifications of a similar tendency which enter 
into every science and which are based upon any prominent 
resemblance or analogy whether as regard objects or laws 
as soon as such point of agreement is perceived between any 
phenomena they constitute themselves into a group or class 
which may become enlarged to any extent by the accession 
of new phenomena bound together by the same point of 
resemblance in this manner the materials of science become 
grouped in classes such as chemistry furnishes examples of 
in its various groups of acids alkalies sulphurets c or 
optics in those classes of phenomena ranged under the heads 
of periodic colours double refraction c and that re 
semblances themselves become traced which it is the busi 
ness of induction to generalise and include in abstract pro 
positions 

the preceding kinds of classification refer not to any 
specific end but are simply framed with a view to put the 
mind in possession of the whole of the properties and rela 
tions of objects embracing any wide department of nature 
that when in the course of its inquiries any startling facts 
occur or any theory is formed it may bring to the contem 
plation of either one or the other all the knowledge which 
can possibly bear upon the subject but classification is not 
confined to this method of arrangement by groups nor do its 
advantages flow in any one channel there is another kind 
which still bears more directly on the successful issue of 
scientific inquiry and that is when we select as the ground 
work of the classification some particular phenomenon whose 



classification by seeies g 

laws are to be investigated and range all the objects which 
bear any resemblance to it in regular gradation according to 
the degree in which they seem to possess the property the law 
of which is sought this has been termed classification by 
series suppose for example the law of transparency was the 
subject of inquiry the collection of the most striking instances 
of this phenomenon would be the first step in the investiga 
tion as most likely to lead by the method of concomitant 
variations to the discovery of the cause hence classifica 
tion by series often brings together a number of objects 
which have nothing in common except the one peculiar pro 
perty which is taken as the head of the classification as in 
that of colourless transparency the list would comprise ob 
jects differing most widely in their nature such as water air 
diamond spirits of wine glass c while the arrangement 
by groups as in the botanical families of euphorbiaceae 
tjmbelliferae c or in the chemical classes of alkalies 
metals c bring together those objects which have most 
properties in common and appear to possess a natural rela 
tion 

but every class formed on a positive resemblance of cha 
racters draws with it the consideration of a negative class in 
which the resemblance does not subsist at all or the contrary 
takes place now it is important as herschel observes to 
distinguish between cases in which there is a real opposition 
of quality or a mere diminution of intensity in some quality 
susceptible of degrees till it becomes imperceptible for 
example between transparency and opacity there would at 
first sight appear a direct opposition but on nearer con 
sideration when we consider the gradations by which trans 
parency diminishes in natural substances we shall see reason 
to admit that the latter quality instead of being the opposite 
of the former is only its extreme lowest degree on the 
other hand the opposite electricities the north and south 
magnetic polarities the alkaline and acid qualities of che 

 mr mill assigns the merit to comte of being the first to treat 
systematically this branch of classification vol ii p but the

mical agents and many other cases exemplify not merely 
a negation of quality as levity or opacity but an active oppo 
sition both these modes of classification were distinguished 
by bacon in his positive and negative instances and have 
their peculiar importance in the inductive process by afford 
ing an opportunity of tracing a relation between phenomena 
by way of contrast and by the observation of a correspond 
ence in the scale of intensity 

with regard to nomenclature three things are particularly 
desirable first completeness or a name for each definite 
object secondly precision or the necessity of one name 
applying to that object and to nothing else thirdly expres 
siveness or that the name either denote the peculiar proper 
ties of the object or the position which it occupies in the 
system now science possesses two splendid examples of 
systematic nomenclature which combine these requirements 
that of plants and animals constructed by linnasus and his 
successors and that of chemistry which we owe to the illus 
trious group of french cliemists who flourished towards the 
close of the eighteenth century there is however an 
essential difference between the two systems which assigns 
the palm of perfection in this department to the latter in 
chemistry the compound substances possess one property 
the chemical composition which is of itself sufficient to dis 
tinguish the kind being a sure mark of all the other pro 
perties of the compound all therefore that was required 
to meet the third condition of a systematic nomenclature was 
to give a name to every compound expressive of its chemical 
composition but in botany and zoology no one property is 
of such a prominent nature as to allow itself to be taken as 
indicative of the others linnsous therefore was obliged to 

 the two modes of classification by groups and series may be com 
bined in zoology on the supposition that the investigations concern the 
laws of animal life since all the natural groups which zoology em 
braces may be arranged in that precise order which is most calculated 
to reveal the law in question but in any other compartment such 
a combination is hopeless as in botany for instance were the phe 
nomena of vegetative life to be inquired into there is no arrangement 
of the different classes of plants in a serial gradation which could throw 
the remotest light on the subject since their leading groups present 
no cases of variations in the particular point assumed as the basis of 
investigation

express the nearest natural affinities of the kind in lieu of 
its distinctive properties by incorporating into its name the 
name of the proximate natural group of which it is one of 
the species thus the name of every species was made to 
consist of the name of the genus or natural group next above 
it with a word added to distinguish the peculiar species on 
this principle is founded the admirable binary nomenclature 
of botany and zoology linnaeus found about seventeen 
hundred generic names with a moderate number of specific 
names sufficient to designate with precision the ten thou 
sand species of vegetables known in his time and notwith 
standing the number of generic names has since greatly in 
creased the augmentation has not kept pace with the multi

formal analysis in physics 

to exemplify the mode by which the inductive inferences 
may be thrown into a corresponding series of syllogisms and 
thus laid open to formal analysis we subjoin the following 
example from mr thomsons outlines of the laws of 
thought 

 in sir humphrey davys experiments upon the decompo 
sition of water by galvanism it was found that besides the 
two components of water oxygen and hydrogen an acid and 
aii alkali were developed at the two opposite poles of the 
machine as the theory of the analysis of water did not give 
reason to expect these products they were a residual phe 
nomenon the cause of which was still to be found some 
chemists thought that electricity had the power of producing 
these substances of itself and if their erroneous conjecture 
had been adopted succeeding researches would have gone 
upon a false scent considering galvanic electricity as a pro 
ducing rather than a decomposing force the happier insight 
of davy conjectured that there might be some hidden cause 
of this portion of the effect the glass vessel containing the 
water might suffer partial decomposition or some foreign

matter might be mingled with the water and the acid and 
alkali be disengaged from it so that the water would have no 
share in their production assuming this he proceeded to 
try whether the total removal of the cause would destroy the 
effect or at least the diminution of it cause a corresponding 
change in the amount of effect produced by the substitu 
tion of gold vessels for the glass without any change in the 
effect he at once determined that the glass was not the cause 
employing distilled water he found a marked diminution of 
the quantity of acid and alkali evolved still there was enough 
to show that the cause whatever it was was still in opera 
tion impurity of the water then was not the sole but a con 
current cause he now conceived that the perspiration from 
the hands touching the instruments might affect the case 
as it would contain common salt and an acid and an alkali 
would result from its decomposition under the agency of 
electricity by carefully avoiding such contact he reduced 
the quantity of the products still further until no more than 
slight traces of them were perceptible what remained of the 
effect might be traceable to impurities of the atmosphere de 
composed by contact with the electrical apparatus an ex 
periment determined this the machine was placed under an 
exhausted receiver and when thus secured from atmospheric 
influence it no longer evolved the acid and the alkali 

 a formal analysis of these beautiful experiments will illus 
trate the method of applying the rules of pure logic in other 
cases 

i statement of the case the residual cause being still undiscovered 
 the decomposition of water by electricity produces oxygen and 
hydrogen with an acid and an alkali 

ii separation of the residual from the principal cause 

a the decomposition of water produces oxygen and hydrogen 

b the production of an acid and alkali in the decomposition of 
water may be caused by action on the glass vessel containing the 
water problematical judgment a 

iii the latter judgment disproved by a syllogism in mood e a o 
fig iii with a conclusion that contradicts it 

 a case in which i employ a vessel of gold cannot involve any 

decomposing action on a glass vessel 
 a case in which i employ a gold vessel still gives the acid and 

the alkali 
 therefore cases of the production of the acid and alkali are not 

always cases in which glass is decomposed

syllogism in a a i fig iii tending to prove this 
 an experiment with distilled water must admit less impurity 
 an experiment with distilled water gives less acid and alkali 
 therefore sometimes with less impurity we have less acid and 
alkali 

v the contact of moist hands may be an additional cause of the 

residual phenomenon 
improved syllogism in a a i fig iii to include this concurrent 

cause 
 an experiment with distilled water and apparatus kept from 

contact of hands will admit still less impurity 
 an experiment c results in the production of still less acid 

and alkali 
 therefore sometimes with still less impurity we have still less 

acid and alkali 
vl amended syllogism a a a fig iii 

 a case where we use these precautions in vacua is a case of no 

impurity 

 a case where we use c in vacua is a case of no acid and alkali 
 therefore a case of no impurity is a case of no acid and alkali 
vii immediate inference from last conclusion 

 cases of no impurity are cases of nonproduction of acid and 

alkali 
 therefore all cases of production of acid and alkali are cases of 

some impurity 
which was to be proved 

 an example like this brings into a strong light many of 
the characteristics of inductive reasoning forms usually 
considered to be deductive are here freely employed the 
later steps tend to confirm the earlier on which however 
they themselves depend so that a mutual confirmation is ob 
tained from setting them together when the chemist sub 
stituted gold vessels for the glass and inferred from the con 
tinuance of the effect under this change that the glass could 
have nothing to do with its production it was formally 
possible in the then state of knowledge that the glass might 
be the cause in the one experiment and the decomposition of 
the gold in the other but the later steps which showed 
that the effect varied with the variations in a circumstance 
wholly distinct from the decomposition of glass or gold re 
duced the possibility of maintaining such a view to the very 
lowest amount even the premisses of particular syllogisms

in the chain are sometimes tested and corrected by the con 
clusion although formally the conclusion should entirely de 
pend upon the premisses the experimenter expected to find 
that the use of distilled water would exclude all impurity 
and he intended that his premiss should assert as much hut 
when it turned out in the conclusion that the supposed pro 
ducts of the impurity were still present he was reduced to 
the choice between abandoning that cause and recasting his 
premiss so as to admit that the cause was still present 
 the use of distilled water gives less impurity

mathematical reasoning 

sir w hamilton has written an essay to disparage mathe 
matical reasoning as a mental discipline and quoted a host 
of writers who support the same view his arguments how 
ever do not seem to us to go farther than to condemn an 
exclusive devotion to this species of learning as injurious to 
the mental faculties and in this view can prove nothing 
excess in every study warps the mind to a degree propor 
tionate to the intellectual capability of the learner nor do 
we see anything in the isolated pursuit of mathematics 
calculated to produce this derangement more conspicuously 
than an exclusive devotion to classics or to metaphysics or 
any other department of learning for our part if we are 
to be bored with learned monoculists we should prefer the 
company of dalembert to person of lagrange to dr 
bentley desirous that the discourse should turn rather on 
substances than words on realities than shadows 

the most that can be said is that the exclusive study of 
mathematics seems to injure the more common and useful 
mode of inference viz that by induction mathematical 
truths being so to speak infallible the moral feelings if 
neglected by their study become less sensitive to the various 
degrees of certainty attending probable inference as when 
one sense is carried to great perfection the others are 
usually less acute so mathematical reasoning seems in 
some degree to injure the other modes of ratiocination 
thus napier wrote nonsense on the historical evidence con 
nected with revelation though he invented logarithms 



bacons chakt ob knowledge 

galileo published a most absurd criticism on the finest 
modern epic in the same month in which lie expounded the 
correct laws of motion and jxewton played the deuce with 
chronology and the prophecies of daniel while he was un 
folding the arcana of the heavens 



division of the sciences 

having treated logic as the science of inference it will 
not form an inappropriate conclusion to a work of this 
character if we direct the readers attention to the various 
subjects in which its methods and rules are employed as 
in the categories we found several tables differing from each 
other by the broad lines of demarcation set up by the dif 
ferent metaphysical systems on which they were projected 
so in the classification of the various departments of human 
knowledge we meet with a similar diversity of arrangement 
with this difference that the ancient attempts have been long 
ago abandoned as imperfect owing to the false views which 
their framers entertained of physical science 

the modern attempts at a general classification of the 
sciences may be said to commence with bacon whose pro 
iection though surprising for his age is based on a false 
principle considering all human knowledge as relative 
bacon was led to believe that the sciences would unfold 
themselves in natural order if mapped out in relation to the 
three distinctive powers of the mind memory imagination 
and reason as however these faculties are simultaneously 
engaged in the production of every mental work the most 
complete confusion was the result of carrying bacons prin 
ciple into detail formal science was confounded with real 
experimental with deductive relation of law and relations 
of theory with relations of facts groups of sciences con 
nected wth the closest affinity divorced from each other 
and the most heterogeneous subjects forced into the bonds 

 mr thomson discriminates a table of categories from a division 
of the sciences by assigning to the former the function of pointing out 
the different attributes with which a conception may be clothed and 
to the latter that of separating the different districts of knowledge 
with the leading and subordinate conceptions which belong to them 
from one another 



 appendix to book v 

of association the history of minerals of vegetables of 
animals being confounded in this chart with the history of 
nations and the history of man would place the labours of 
boswell in company with the labours of cuvier and the 
researches of hunter by the side of the researches of gib 
bon botany zoology and chemistry were separated from 
their histories and joined to metaphysics painting and 
music were ranked under the head of artes voluptarias with 
cookery and cosmetics the anatomy of the human frame 
was severed from the anatomy of animals and the doctrine of 
angels and spirits confounded with natural theology 

after bacon whose chart was adopted by diderot and 
dalembert as the basis of their celebrated encyclopaedia 
no similar attempt was made until lockes time who en 
larged the greek classification as follows 



aj sica 



teconomics tlogic 

practica politics seiam rhetoric 

ethics grammar 

with the exception of smith and turgot who followed 
locke the subject has not been philosophically considered by 
any writer of public importance down to very recent times 
dugald stewart in reviewing the past efforts to construct a 
genealogical chart of the sciences pronounced the labour 
hopeless at least in his generation 

coleridge however imagined he saw in the relations of 
necessity and the relations of choice a clue to the entire 
labyrinth of human knowledge in the systematic order in 
which it is viewed by superior intelligences and after a 
vague and sanguine development of his theory in a style 
suited rather to the dim magnificence of poetry than to 
philosophic disquisition he surveys the domain of knowledge 
from 
t r formal i e purely intellectual 

t vt necessary relations r moral sciences 
point of the real j mixed 

intellect i 

cause and effect 
and thence or 

proceeds to relations of theory 



colebldges and bertrams division 

but as this division was far from exhausting the sub 
ject coleridge found himself obliged to institute a distinct 
head under miscellaneous to which he consigned one 
third of the encyclopedia metropolitana whose ground 
work was taken from his plan to profess however to map 
out all the compartments of knowledge and annex as a sequel 
to the chart a voluminous chapter of miscellanea is precisely 
the case of smalgruenius who wrote a work entitled de 
omnibus rebus and afterwards added a supplementary 
treatise de quibusdam aliis 

but the chart is as theoretically wrong as it is prac 
tically worthless eelations of necessity and relations of 
cause and effect instead of being coordinate branches of 
philosophy are considered abstractedly no less intimately 
connected than a general law with one of its particular ex 
emplifications we cannot without subverting our mental 
constitution consider matter otherwise than as subject to the 
great law which regulates the procession of phenomena than 
we can believe that two and three make six or that the 
whole is less than its part even in the objective light that 
coleridge seems to have regarded the causal relation far from 
being confined to any peculiar class of sciences it runs 
through them all and claims a coextensive dominion with 
the empirical element itself instead therefore of being con 
centric with the transcendental relation the laws of cause 
and effect as here considered are as subordinate to it as 
scientia activa in bacons sense is subordinate to the 
primary philosophy throughout the entire range of the 
sciences with the single exceptions of logic and mathematics 
necessary and causal relations are more or less interwoven 
with each other and to regard them as separate branches 
leading to distinct groups of science is to revive in a worse 
form the error of bacon which we have pointed out in the 
text 

bentham in his chrestomathia adopting the bifurcate 
division which eamus took from the isagoge of porphyry 
attempted to draw a similar genealogical tree of the sciences 
but found the first rough sketch so unpromising that he did 
not attempt to pursue the subject into detail he fixed his 
point of departure of course in utility which he divided into 
being in general and what is not being the first branch 
giving rise to metaphysics and the natural sciences in so far 



 appendix to book v 

as they relate to the essences of things the latter to the 
formal sciences and those which embrace the accidents or 
changes to which all bodies spiritual or corporal are liable to 
undergo it is needless to dwell upon a division which if 
practically adopted would confound all human knowledge in 
obliterating the old landmarks which have since science had 
a name served to map out the boundaries of its diversified 
dominions and in splitting up each subject heretofore con 
sidered unique and inseparable into elements as various and 
multiform as the shifting light of opinion may choose to 
invest them with 

it was reserved for ampere to distance all his competitors 
in constructing a chart of universal knowledge as theore 
tically perfect as it is practically useful by adopting du 
gald stewarts fundamental division of matter and mind 
and classifying everything he considered in either of the two 
categories the questions he asked himself concerning each 
science were what subjects did it embrace and in what 
point of view was it regarded by others the first led him 
to fix its boundaries and assign its correlations the second 
to determine its place in the chart and the groups of sciences 
by which it should be surrounded in every other respect 
the order followed is precisely analogous to that adopted by 
linnaus in the classification of the vegetable kingdom 
having divided his field into the two great kingdoms of 
matter and mind ampere groups the sciences whose bounda 
ries he had previously laid down in distinct families or kinds 
which he collects into species of a higher order and then 
proceeds to assign the leading branches or genera into which 
the cognate kingdom is divided and in which the species of 
the scientific groups are included the kingdom and 
branches with their subordinate orders and distinct families 
of sciences are connected with each other by a bifurcate divi 
sion which separates the experimental sections the pro 
dromi as bacon calls them from those which refer to the 
perfect sciences and thus keeps distinct throughout the 
deductive and empirical departments of knowledge at the 
head of each rank stands its peculiar and leading idea the 
subordinate orders being at once divergent and concentric 
branching out into the numerous sciences of which they are 
composed as well as guiding to the unique trunk whence 



ampebes tables 

they spring when we say that no groups of sciences are 
found together but those which reflect mutual light on each 
other and whose proximity is therefore desirable in the 
study of the same art or profession and that the knowledge 
of no science in the chart presupposes the acquisition of any 
which have not gone before we have given the highest testi 
mony in favour of its practical utility we subjoin the 
tables in extenso which ampere spent the best part of his 
life in constructing the latin verses which follow point 
out the leading conception of each science in the chart to 
which they bear literal reference and enable the classical 
reader by a slight mnemonic effort to grasp the leading divi 
sions of human knowledge in their most minute scientific 
speciality and in that order most calculated to favour their 
study and development

 a ascinating little edition notes and queries 

a cheap very comely and altogether desirable edition westminster gazette 

 but a few years ago such volumes would have heen deemed worthy to be considered 
editions de luxe today the low price at which they are offered to the public alone 
prevents them being so regarded studio 

 handy in shape and size wonderfully cheap beautifully printed from the cam 
bridge text and illustrated quaintly yet admirably by mr byam shaw we have nothing 
but praise for it no one who wants a good and convenient shakespeare without 
excursuses discursuses or even top many notes can do better in our opinion than 
subscribe to this issue which is saying a good deal in these days of cheap reprints 
vanity fair 

altogether it is a pretty and desirable little edition and its moderate price should 
make it accessible to all classes of readers scotsman 

what we like about these elegant booklets is the attention that has been paid to the 
paper as well as to the print and decoration such stout laid paper will last for ages 
on this account alone the chiswick should easily be first among pocket shake 
speares pall mall gazette 

 no more delightful edition of shakespeare has ever come under our notice the 
price is d net brings sumptuous shakespeare within reach of all with each 
new volume our admiration of this dainty edition deepens independent
