the matters collected in this syllabus will be found in those of my 
writings of which the titles follow i on the structure of the 
syllogism cambridge transactions vol viii part 
ii formal logic or the calculus of inference necessary and 
probable london taylor and walton vo iii on the 
symbols of logic the theory of the syllogism and in particular of 
the copula cambridge transactions vol ix part 
iv on the syllogism no iii and on logic in general cambridge 
transactions vol x part of these works the formulae 
and notation of the first are entirely superseded the notation only of 
the second the formal logic may be advantageously replaced see 
 by that of the third and fourth and of the present tract there 
is very little in the first three writings on which my opinion has 
varied but of all three it is to be said that they are entirely based 
on what i now call the arithmetical view f the proposition and 
syllogism extending this term not merely to the 
numerically definite syllogism but to the ordinary form to my own 
extension of it and to sir w hamiltons departure from it 

 the writings which oppose any of my views at length are the following so far 
as my memory serves i a letter to augustus de morgan esq on his claim to 
an independent rediscovery of a new principle in the theory of syllogism from sir

 pbeface 

the relations of my work on formal logic to the present 
syllabus are as follows chapter i first notions may afford previous 
knowledge to the student who has hitherto paid no attention to the 
subject chapter iii on the abstract form of the proposition may 
be consulted at of this syllabus chapters iv on propositions 
and v and vi on the syllogism are rendered more easy by the nota 
tion of this syllabus and are partially superseded chapter xiv 
on the verbal description of the syllogism is entirely superseded 



rest of the work may be read as the titles of the chapters 
suggest 

a syllabus deals neither in development nor in diversified ex 
ample and does not make the space occupied by any detail a 
measure of its importance as a part of the whole i have omitted 
many subjects which are to be found in all the books or dwelt lightly 
upon them partly because more detail is contained in my formal 
logic partly because any one who masters this tract will be able to 
judge for himself what i should have written on the omitted subjects 
i have also endeavoured to remember that as a work of this kind 
proceeds less detail of explanation is necessary 

i should suppose that a student of ordinary logic would find no 
great difficulty in understanding my meaning and that those who 
are accustomed to symbolic expression mathematical or not would 
even though unused to logical study find no more difficulty than an 
ordinary student finds in aldrichs compendium either of these 
classes i should think would not fail to come to the point of under 
standing at which a reflecting mind can allow itself to meditate 
acceptance or rejection without latent fear of overconfidence 
whether a beginner who is conversant neither with ordinary logic 
nor with symbolic language will comprehend me is another question 
and one on which those who try will divide into more than two 
classes such a reader making concrete examples for himself as he 
goes on and never leaving any article until he has done this will 
either get through the whole tract or will stop at the precise point at 
which he ought to stop upon the principle of the next paragraph 

every spoon has some mouths that it can feed and some that it 
cannot every writer has some readers who are made for him and 
he for them and some between whom and himself there is a great 
gulph i might prove this in my own case by a chain of discordant 



preface 



testimonies running through thirty years if i had leisure and liking 
to hunt up extracts from reviews i will content myself with a 
couple which are at hand observing that i have no acquaintance 
with the authors in i published my treatise on arithmetic 
and the following sentences speedily appeared in reviews of it 



this book appears to us to mystify a 
very simple science 



it is as clear as cobbett in bis lucid 
intervals 



in i published my formal logic and two opponents of my 
views wrote as follows 

mr de morgan i this is an undeniably long extract and yet we would did our 
is certainly not a j limsts allow continue it we beg the readers notice to 
lucid writer the exquisite precision of its language to the definiteness of 

every line in the picture for though it is a description of a 
profound mental process still it is a luminous picture the light 
of which does not interfuse its lineaments we are at 
very solemn issue with mr de morgan upon this argument 

these antagonisms remind us of the stork and the fox and of the 
failure of their attempts to entertain each other at dinner when an 
authors dish and a readers beak do not match they must either 
divide the blame or agree to throw it on that exquisite piece of 
atheism the nature of things 

the points on which i differ from writers on logic are so many 
and so fundamental that i am among them as hobbes among the 
geometers and mutato nomine may say with him of malmesbury 
in magno quidem periculo versari video escistimationem meam qui a 
logicis fere omnibus dissentio eorum enim qui de iisdem rebus 
mecum aliquid ediderunt aut solus insanio ego aut solus non insanio 
tertium enim non est nisi quod dicet forte aliquis insaniamus 
omnes 

hobbes was in the wrong the question of parallel or contrast 
must be left to time but though some writers on logic explicitly 
renounce me and all my works yet one point of those same works is 
adopted here and one there so that in time it may possibly be said 

that 

mahometans eat up the hog 

all these differences are not about the truth or falsehood of my 
neologisms but about the legitimacy of their adoption into logic the 
study of the laws of thought and i cannot imitate hobbes so far 



 preface 

as to write contra fastum logicorum seeing that oblitis obliviscendis 
i have personally nothing but courtesy to acknowledge from all the 
writers of known name who have done me the honour of alluding to 
my speculations in return i endeavour to tilt at their shields and 
not at their faces should i make any one feel that i have missed 
my attempt i will pray the introduction into these lists of the old 
practice of the playground when i was a boy any offence against 
the rules of the game was held to be nullified if the offender before 
notice taken could cry slips as i now do over all to meet con 
tingencies as to the matter of our differences i neither give nor 
take quarter it is 

i will lay on for tusculum 

do thou lay on for rome 

as will sufficiently appear in my notes 

now to another topic i produce a fragment of a wellknown 
conversation those who choose may fill up the chasms 

 i therefore dressed up three paradoxes with some ingenuity the 
whole learned world i made no doubt would rise to oppose my systems but then i 
was prepared to oppose the whole learned world like the porcupine i sat self 
collected with a quill pointed against every opposer well said my boy cried i 
 you published your paradoxes well and what did the learned world say to 
your paradoxes sir replied my son the learned world said nothing to my para 
doxes nothing at all sir every man of them was employed in praising his friends 
and himself or condemning his enemies and unfortunately as i had neither i 
suffered the cruellest mortification neglect 

a friend of the author just quoted remarked that a shuttlecock 
cannot be kept up unless it be struck from both ends i was spared 
all the mortification of neglect by the eminence of the player who 
took up the other battledore of this celebrated opponent i can truly 
say that so far as i myself was concerned i never looked with any 
thing but satisfaction upon certain points of procedure to which i 
shall only make distant allusion for i saw from the beginning that 
he was playing my game and raising the wind which was to blow 
about the seeds of my plant the mathematicians who have written 
on logic in the last two centuries have been wholly unknown to even 
the farsearching inquirers of the aristotelian world to the late sir 
william hamilton of edinburgh i owe it that i can present this tract 
to the moderately well informed elementary student of logic as con 
taining matters of which he is likely enough to have heard something 
and may possibly be curious to hear more 



preface 

in controversy and controversy was to him an element of life 
and a spring of action sir william hamilton was too much the 
fencer of the moment too much the firer of tomorrows article his 
impulses sometimes leap him over the barrier which divides philosophy 
from philosophism hoot the proofs of this out of his pages and we 
have before us a man both learned and ingenious profound and acute 
weighty and flexible displaying a most instructive machinery of 
thought as well when judged right as when judged wrong save only 
when cause of regret arises that oxford did not demand of his youth 
two books of euclid and simple equations in describing a character 
some points of which are at tug of war especially when liking for 
quotation was one of them greek may meet greek he showed 
more fondness than was politic in one so plainly destined to survive 
the grave for a too literal version of the motto

of the mathematician from the darkness of his want of notion of the 
mathematics his great and admitted defect as a psychologist i dealt

sketch of him to his sketch of me without the least misgiving as to 
which of the two will be pronounced the best likeness

syllabus 



 logic analyses the forms or laws of action of thought 

 logic has a tendency to correct first inaccuracy of thought secondly 
inaccuracy of expression many persons who think logically express them 
selves illogically and in so doing produce the same effect upon their hearers 
or readers as if they had thought wrongly this applies especially to teachers 
many of whom accurate enough in their own thoughts nourish sophism in 
their pupils by illogical expression 

it is very commonly said that studies which exercise the thinking faculty 
and especially mathematics are means of cultivating logic and may stand 
in place of systematic study of that science this is true so far that every 
discipline strengthens the logical power that is to say strengthens most of 
what it finds be the same good or bad it is further true that every disci 
pline corrects some bad habits but it is equally true that every discipline 
tends to confirm some bad habits accordingly though every exercise of 
mind does much more good than harm yet no person can be sure of avoiding 
the harm and retaining only the good except by that careful examination of 
his own mental habits which most often takes place in a proper study of logic 
and is seldom made without it this being done and the house being built 
the scaffolding may be thrown away if the builder please though in most 
cases it will be advisable to keep it at hand for use when inspection or 
repairs are needed some persons make the argument about the utility of 
logic turn on the question whether disputation is or is not best conducted 
syllogistically on which i hold waiving the utter irrelevancy of the 
question that those who cannot so argue need to learn while those who can 
have no need to practise it is just the same with spelling 

as to the difficult word form and the variations of it i refer to dr 
thomsons outlines of the necessary laws of thought by a form 
of thought i mean a necessary law of action considered independently 
of any particular matter of thought to which it is applied 

 logic is formal not material it considers the law of 
action apart from the matter acted on it is not psychological 
not metaphysical it considers neither the mind in itself nor the 
nature of things in itself but the mind in relation to things and 
things in relation to the mind nevertheless it is so far psycho 

b 



 subdivisions names 

logical as it is concerned with the results of the constitution of the 
mind and so far metaphysical as it is concerned with the right 
use of notions about the nature and dependence of things which 
be they true or be they false as representations of real existence 
enter into the common modes of thinking of all men 

 the study of elementary logic includes the especial con 
sideration of 

 the term or name the written or spoken sign of an 

object of thought or of a mode of thinking 

 the copula or relation the connexion under which 

terms are thought of together 

 the proposition terms in relation with one another 

and the judgment the decision of the mind upon a 
proposition usually joined in one under one or 
other of the names 

 the syllogism deduction of relation by combination of 

other relations 

 the thing which is not of the mind and can be imagined 
to exist without the mind is the object the mind itself is called 
the subject of that object thus even a relation between two 
minds may be an object to a third mind logic considers only 
the connexion of the subjective and objective it treats of things 
non secundum se sed secundum esse quod habent in anima 

 the consideration of names as names may be made to fur 
nish the key to the mechanical or instrumental treatment of the 
ordinary proposition and the ordinary syllogism 

 for this purpose a name is a mere mark attached to an 
object a letter painted on a post would do as well for expla 
nation as the name of a notion or concept in the mind attached in 
thought to an external object in this part of the subject the 
assertion every man ig an animal is treated as if it were merely 
 every object which has the name man has also the name 
animal it answers to every post on which x is painted 
has also y painted on it 

 remember that in producing a name the existence of things to which 
it applies is predicated i e asserted and existence in the universe 
of the propositions there is no conditional proposition intended as every 
x is y if y exist every proposition is a conceivable or imaginable truth 
when its terms are conceivable or imaginable except only when it announces 
a contradiction as some men are not men or when it is its own subject 
matter and denies itself as what i now say is false a proposition which is 
false if it be true and true if it be false 



 proposition quantity 

 the proposition in this view is no more than the con 
nexion of name with name as marks of the same object the 
judgment is no more than assertion or denial of that connexion 

the word is asserts the connexion the words is not deny it 

 this kind of proposition belongs to the arithmetical view of 
logic there is in it result of enumeration of similar instances as 
in every x is y xs are not ys ie there are or more 
instances in which the name x occurs unassociated with the 
name y 

 the firstmentioned name is called the subject the second 
the predicate 

 the logical quantity ie number of instances is either 
definite or more or less vague 

 definite quantity is either absolutely or relatively definite 
absolutely as in xs and no more are ys relatively as in 
 sevenths and no more of all the xs are ys and in all the 
xs are ys and in none of the xs are ys which last is both 
absolutely and relatively definite 

 quantity may be definite at one end and vague at the 
other as in or more xs are ys at least sevenths of 
all the xs are ys most of the xs i e more than half are 
ys which however is limited at one end not dejinite 

 the only perfectly definite quantities in ordinary use are 
all and none the materials for other absolute or relative nume 
rical definiteness are but seldom found in human knowledge 
the words all and none are signs of total quantity and make 
propositions universal as all xs are ys no xs are ys 

 the contrary usually called contradictory propositions of 
the last are some xs are not ys and some xs are ys 
here f some is a quantity entirely vague in one direction it is 
notnone one at least or more allf it may be some in 
common life often means both notnone and notall in logic only 
notnone some is the mark of partial quantity and the propo 
sitions which commence with it are particular the contrary 
usually contradictory forces of the pairs are seen in either all 
xs are ys or some xs are not ys not both and in either no 
xs are ys or some xs are ys not both 

 kemember that some does not guarantee more than one there is 
much distinction between none no one as the logical contrary of some 
one or more and nothing as the limit of some quantity in passing from 
the proposition no man can live without air to there is one man at least 
who can live without air we make a transition which alters the notions 



 quantity universe 

or concepts attached to man the word man no longer represents entirely 
the same idea but in passing from an indenture of apprenticeship with no 
premium at all to one with a premium of one farthing we make no change 
of notion an act was once passed exempting such indentures from duty 
when the premium was under five pounds sterling the court of kings 
bench held that the exemption did not apply when there was no premium at 
all because no premium at all is not a premium under five pounds 
that is the judges gave to nothing as the terminus of continuous quantity 
the force of none as the logical contrary of some and violated to the 
utmost the principle of the act which was intended as a relief to those 
who could only pay small premiums and a fortiori or rather a fortissimo 
to those who could pay none at all lawyers ought to be much of logicians 
and something of mathematicians 

f some may be all in common language this is or is not the case 
according to the speakers state of knowledge but in logic there are no 
implications which depend upon the matter when a logician says that 
every x is y he means that all the xs are some ys and that some 
ys are all the xs whether he have or have not exhausted all the ys 
he does not here profess to state even if he know again when he says 
 some xs are ys he does not mean to imply some xs are not ys that 
is his some may be all for anything he asserts to the contrary but when 
two propositions each of which contains the vague some are conjoined the 
mere meaning may render the conjunction an absurdity unless some take the 
force of all just as in algebra an equation having two unknown quantities 
has the values of those quantities vague but when two such equations are 
conjoined those values become definite so in logic in which the same thing 
occurs thus the two propositions all xs are some ys and all ys are 
some xs when true together force the inference that some must in both 
cases be all forget that some is that which may be all and these two 
propositions appear to contradict one another very distinguished logicians 
have asserted that they do so sir w hamilton discussions nd edition 
p calls them incompossible propositions meaning propositions which 
cannot be true together the word is an excellent one and much wanted 
but not here these two propositions are not incompossible unless some 
take into its meaning notall as well as notnone and some is never allowed 
by logicians to mean notall it is needless to argue things so plain it would 
have been needless to state them twice except for the eminence of the 
writers who deny them upon occasion 

 in f all xs are ys y is partially spoken of there may 
or may not be more ys besides the same of some xs are ys 
in no xs are ys and in some xs are not ys y is totally 
spoken of each x spoken of is not any one of all the ys 

 by the universe of a proposition is meant the collection 
of all objects which are contemplated as objects about which 
assertion or denial may take place let every name which belongs 
to the whole universe be excluded as needless this must be parti 
cularly remembered let every object which has not the name 



 universal etc affirmative etc 

x of icldch there are always some be conceived as therefore 
marked with the name x meaning notx and called the contrary 
of x thus every thing is either x or x nothing is both all 
xs are ys means no xs are ys no xs are ys means all 
xs are ys some xs are not ys means some xs are ys 

 some xs are ys means some xs are not ys 

 the following enlarged definitions include the definitions 
above given and apply to all the uses of terms and relations in 
this work let a term be total or partial according as every 
existing instance must or need not be examined to verify the 
proposition thus in e everything is either x or y x and y 
are both partial an object being examined and found to be x 
the proposition is made good so far as that object is concerned 
that object may also be y but if so it need not be ascertained 
consequently y is partially spoken of and the same may be said 
of x but in some things are neither xs nor ys x and y 
are both total we can only verify it by an object which is not 
any one of the xs and not any one of the ys 

 let a proposition be universal or particular according as 
the whole universe of objects must or need not be examined to 
verify it thus f everything is either x or y is plainly uni 
versal but f some things are neither xs nor ys is particular 
the first object examined may settle the truth of the propo 
sition 

 let a proposition be affirmative which is true of x and x 
false of x and notx or x negative which is true of x and x 
false of x and x thus every x is y is affirmative every 
x is x is true every x is x is false but f some things are 
neither xs nor ys is also affirmative though in the form of a 
denial some things are neither xs nor xs is true though 
superfluous in expression some things are neither xs nor xs is 
false again everything is either x or y is negative though 
in the form of an assertion everything is either x or x is 
false everything is either x or x is true 

 when contrary terms are introduced it is impossible to define the 
opposition of quality by assertion or denial for every assertion is a denial 
and every denial is an assertion the denial no x is y is the assertion 

 all xs are ys the necessary distinction between affirmative and negative 
is therefore drawn as in the text these technical terms are retained though 
perhaps they are hardly the right ones for me to use 

 affirmative and negative propositions are said to be of 
different quality 



 forms of enunciation 

 let x totally spoken of be x or x let x partially 
spoken of be x or x let a negative proposition be denoted 
by one dot an affirmative proposition by two dots or none at 
pleasure i follow sir william hamilton in calling this notation 
spicular see note so far as yet appears we have pro 
positions with the following symbols 

universal affirmative xy all xs are some ys 
particular negative xy some xs are not all ys 

universal negative xy all xs are not all ys 
particular affirmative x y some xs are some ys 



contraries 



contraries 



ies li 



 these forms have been denoted by the letters a o e i 
for many centuries a and i from the vowels in hffvrmo e and 
o from the vowels in ngq the word all in parentheses is 
not grammatical the word any should be substituted for all 
the reason why for the present i do not use f any will appear in 
the sequel 

 take the four pairs x y xy x y x y and apply 
the four forms above to all four sixteen results appear of 
which eight are but a repetition of the other eight of the eight 
which are distinct we have four written above the remaining 
four appear among the following 

from we have xy xy xy and xy of these 
xy is obviously xy and xy is xy a new form no 
notx is noty nothing is both notx and noty everything is 
either x or y this being a universal proposition with both 
terms partial and also a negative proposition let it be marked 
xy again xy is xy or yx or no y is notx or 
every y is x or some xs are all ys or xy 

from we have xqy xqy xy xy here x y 
is x y and x y is y x some ys are not xs or all xs are 
not some ys or xy and xy is a new form some notxs 
are notys some things are neither xs nor ys this is a par 
ticular proposition affirmative with x and y both total let it be 
marked xy 

 any one who wishes to test himself and his friends upon the question 
whether analysis of the forms of enunciation would be useful or not may try 
himself and them on the following question is either of the following 
propositions true and if either which all englishmen who do not take 
snuff are to be found among europeans who do not use tobacco all 
englishmen who do not use tobacco are to be found among europeans who 
do not take snuff llequired immediate answer and demonstration 



 



forms of enunciation 



 



 the eight distinct forms in which x and y appear 
are as follows the ungrammatical introduction all being made 
as before 

universal propositions contrary particular propositions 

xy all xs are some ys xy some xs are not all ys 

xy all xs are not all ys xqy 

xy everything is either some x xy 

or some y or both 
xy some xs are all ys xy 

for symmetry xy might be read everything is either not 
all x or not all y and x y as some things are both 
some xs and some ys this will be better seen when we 
come to at present however i preserve the ordinary 
reading 

 the following is the comparison of the notation in my formal logic 
with that used in my second and third papers in the cambridge transactions 
and in this syllabus 



some xs are some ys 
some things are not either 

all xs nor all ys 
all xs are not some ys 



for xy

xy and a

for xy d and a a 
for x y d and a a 
for xcy d and a o 



for xoy c and e i 
for x y c and e e 
for xoy c and e i 



these comparative notations being fixed in the mind any part of my formal 
logic may be read in illustration of the present work and the detailed 
character note of the latest notation is if i may judge so much of a 
facilitation that any reader of the formal logic will find it easier to trans 
late the notation as he goes on than to confine himself entirely to the 
notation of that work and this especially as to the tests of validity and the 
assignment of the symbol of inference 

 the thirtytwo forms which arise from application of 
contraries are as now written all the eight cases above being 
used the four in each line are of identical meaning 

universals 

xy xy xy 
xy xy xy 
xy xy xy 
xy xy xy 

 the rule of contraversion changing a name into its 
contrary without altering the import of the proposition is change 
also the quantity of the term and the quality of the proposition 
thus xy is xy and xy when both names are contra

relations of propositions 



 



verted change both quantities and preserve the quality thus 
xyisxy 

 the rule of conversion making the names change 
places without altering the import of the proposition is write 
or read the proposition backwards thus xy is yx or 
xy may be read backwards some ys are all xs that is 
make both the terms and their quantities change places 

 writers on logic have nearly always meant by conversion merely the 
change of place in the terms without change of place in the quantities ac 
cordingly when the quantities are different common logical conversion 
is illegitimate thus xy and yx are not the same but xy and 
yqx are the same there is this difficulty in the way of using the word 
conversion in the sense proposed in the text namely that common logic has 
rooted it in common language that every x is y is the converse true 
or false as the case may be of every y is x leaving the common 
idioms for the student to do as he likes with i shall if i have occasion to 
speak of a proposition in which terms only are converted and not quantities 
call it a term converse 

 each universal is inconsistent with the universals of dif 
ferent qualities and indifferent to the universal of different quan 
tities thus xy is inconsistent with x g y and xy and 
neither affirms nor denies xy each universal affirms the 
particulars of the same quality contradicts the particular of 
different quantities and is indifferent to the particular of the same 
quantities thus xy affirms xy and xy contradicts 
xy and neither affirms nor denies xy

 contrary names in identical propositions always appear

 syllogism 

 in a universal proposition if one term be partial it has 
the amount not the character of the quantity of the other if both 
the quantities of the two terms together make up the whole uni 
verse with the part common to both if any repeated twice 

 in a particular proposition the quantity of a partial term 
is vague but remains the same through all forms and when 
both terms are total the partial quantity still remains expressed 
as in xy or some things are neither xs nor ys which some 
things are as many as the xs or ys in the equivalents xy 
xyandxy 

 if a proposition containing x and y be joined with a 
proposition containing y and z a third proposition containing x 
and z may necessarily follow in this case the two first pro 
positions premises and the proposition which follows from them 
conclusion form a syllogism 

 if an x be a y if that same y be a z then the x is the 
z this is the unitsyllogism from collections of which all the 
syllogisms of this mode of treating propositions must be formed 
at first sight it seems as if there were another if an x be a y 
if that same y be not any z then the x is not any z but this 
comes under the first as follows the x is a y that y is a z 
therefore the x is a z that is is not any z the introduction of 
contraries brings all denials under assertions 

 two premises have a valid conclusion when and only 
when they necessarily contain unitsyllogisms and the con 
clusion has one item of quantity for every unitsyllogism so 
necessarily contained 

 and all syllogisms may be derived from the following 
combinations 

 or xy yz or all xs are ys and all ys are zs 
the conclusion is xz all xs are zs there is the unitsyllogism 
this x is a y that same y is a z repeated as often as there are 
xs in existence in the universe or xyz gives xz or 
 gives 

 or xy yz or some xs are ys all ys are zs 
the conclusion is x z some xs are zs there is the unit 
syllogism so often as there are xs in the first premise or 
xyz gives xz or gives 

 or xy yz or some xs are all ys some ys are zs 
the conclusion is x z some xs are zs this case is as to form 

c 



 yahieties of syllogism 

nothing but the last form inverted or xyz gives xz or 



 or xy yz or some xs are all ys all ys are zs 
the conclusion is xz some xs are zs as many as there are 
ys in the universe or xyz gives xqz or gives 
but this case gives no stronger conclusion than or than 
though it has both premises universal 

these are all the ways in which affirmative premises produce 
a conclusion in a manner which has no need to take cognisance of 
the existence of contrary terms and since all negations are con 
tained among affirmations about contraries we may expect that 
application of these cases to all combinations of direct and contrary 
will produce all possible valid syllogisms 

 apply the form to the eight varieties xyz xyz 
xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz xyz and contravert x y z when 
ever they appear thus applied to x y z is xyz or 
xy combined with yz or xyz or the con 
clusion is xz or xz that is xyz gives xz or 
if some xs be all make up all the ys and everything be either 
y or z then everything is either x or z this process applied 
to the eight varieties gives the following eight forms of universal 
syllogism that is universal premises with universal conclusion 

 x x x x

 test of validity rule of inference 

here are all the ways in which two universals give the same 
quantity to the middle term 

 there are possible combinations of which the 
enumerated give inference the remaining may be found by 
applying the eight varieties to and and 
in no case does any inference follow thus xy and yz 
are consistent with any of the eight relations between x and z 
which should be ascertained by trial 

 the test of validity and the rule of inference are as 
follows 

there is inference when both the premises are universal 
 when one premise only being particular the middle term has 
different quantities in the two premises 

the conclusion is found by erasing the middle term and its 
quantities thus gives or that is no x 
is y and everything is either y or z gives every x is z 

 premises of like quality give an affirmative conclusion of 
different quality a negative a universal conclusion can only 
follow from universals with the middle term differently quan 
tified in the two from two particular premises nothing can 
follow 

 a particular premise having the concluding term strength 
ened the conclusion is also strengthened and the syllogism is 
converted into a universal having the middle term strengthened 
the conclusion is not strengthened and the syllogism is converted 
into a strengthened particular syllogism thus if with 
conclusion have the premise strengthened into the syllo 
gism becomes and yields but if be strengthened into 
 the syllogism becomes and yields only as before 

 a universal conclusion affirms two particulars if either 
of these be substituted in the conclusion of the universal syllogism 
the syllogism may be called a universal of weakened conclusion 
or a weakened universal thus xyz made to yield only x z 
or xz instead of xz is a universal of weakened conclusion 
no further notice need be taken of this case 

 of the syllogisms of particular conclusion the con 
clusions are equally divided among x anc e 
following table is one of many modes of arrangement of the 
whole

the middle column contains the universals and each universal 
stands horizontally between the two particulars into which it may 
be weakened by weakening one of the concluding terms and 
each strengthened particular stands vertically between the two 
particulars from which it may be formed by altering the quantity 
of the middle term in the particular premise only 

 if two propositions give a third say a and b give c 
then a b c meaning the contrary propositions of a b c it 
follows that a b c cannot all be true together hence if a c 
be true b must be false or b true that is if a b give c then 
a c give b or either premise joined with the contrary of the 
conclusion gives the contrary of the other premise and thus 
each form of syllogism has two opponent forms but the order of 
terms will not be correct unless the premise which is retained be 
converted if the order of the terms in the syllogism be xy 
yz xz we shall have in one opponent xy xz yz which in 
our mode of arrangement must be yx xz yz the retained 
premise changing the order of its terms 

thus the opponent forms of which gives are as 
follows first retained premise converted contrary of 
conclusion contrary of other premise giving and con 
clusion secondly contrary of conclusion retained 
premise converted contrary of other premise giving 
and conclusion 

 the universal and particular syllogisms can be grouped 
by threes each one of any three having the other two for its 



 opponents quantity of conclusion 

opponents and these groups can be collected in the following 
zodiac as it may be called 

 j 



o w v 

the universal propositions at the cardinal points are so placed that 
any two contiguous give a universal syllogism whether read 
forwards or backwards as join each of these 
universals with its contiguous external particular so as to read in 
a contrary direction to that in which the two universals were read 
and a triad is formed each member of which has the other two 
members for its opponent forms as in 

 or as in x ox 

 the strengthened particulars have weakened universals 
 for their opponent forms thus with the conclusion 
 has with the conclusion and with the conclusion 
 for its opponents and with the conclusion has 
with the conclusion and with the conclusion for its 
opponents 

 the partial terms of the conclusion take quantity in the 
following manner 

in universal syllogisms if one term of the conclusion be 
partial its quantity is that of the other term if both one has at 
least the quantity of the whole middle term and the other of the 
whole contrary of the middle term 

 in fundamental particular syllogisms the partial term or 
terms of the conclusion take quantity from the particular premise 

 in strengthened particular syllogisms the partial term or 
terms take quantity from the whole middle term or its whole 
contrary according to which is universal in both of the premises 

 these rules run through every form of the conclusion in 
which there is a particular term thus xyz gives 

 xz in which z has the quantity of x 

 xz in which x has the quantity of z 

 xz xs as many as ys and zs as many as ys 



 sorites complex proposition 

again xyz gives xz xz and xz in which the 
quantities of x and of z are the number of instances in the 
 some things of yz 

thirdly xyz gives xz xz xz and x in 
which the quantities of x and z are the number of instances 
in y 

 a sorites is a collection of propositions in which the major 
term of each is the minor term of the next as in 

xyztuvw 

or all xs are ys and noy is z and everything is either z or 
t and every t is tj and no u is v and some vs are all ws 

 a sorites gives a valid inference universal when all 
the premises are universal and each intermediate term enters once 
totally and once partially particular when one and one only 
of the two conditions just named is broken once whether by con 
tiguous universals having an intermediate of one quantity in both 
or by occurrence of one particular without breach of the rule of 
quantity 

 the inference is obtained by erasing all the intermediate 
terms and their quantities and allowing an even number of dots 
to indicate affirmation and an odd number of dots to indicate 
negation 

thus xyztuvw g i v e s xw 
xyztuvw g i v es xw 
xyztuv gives xv 

 we have seen that each universal may coexist with either 
the universal of altered quantities or with its contrary which is 
a species of terminal ambiguity thus xy may have either 
xy or xy true at the same time all these coexistences 
may be arranged and symbolised as follows giving propositions 
which with reference to the ambiguity aforesaid have terminal 
precision 

 xy or both xy and xy all xs and some things besides are ys 

 x y or both xy and xy all xs are ys and all ys are xs 

 xy or both xy and xy among xs are all the ys and some 

things besides 

 xoy or both xy and xy nothing both x and y and some 

things neither 

 xy or both xy and xy nothing both x and y and every 

thing one or the other 

 xoy or both xy and xy every thing either x or y and some 

things both 



 



complex syllogism 



 



 if any two be joined each of which is or with 
the middle term of different quantities these premises yield a 
conclusion of the same kind obtained by erasing the symbols of 
the middle term and one of the symbols o thus xoyoz 
gives xoz or if nothing be both x and y and some things 
neither and if every thing be either y or z and some things both 
it follows that all xs and two lots of other things are zs 

 in any one of these syllogisms it follows that may be 
written for o or in one place or j for either or o in one 
place without any alteration of the conclusion except reducing 
the two lots to one but if this be done in both places the con 
clusion is reduced to or and both lots disappear let the 
reader examine for himself the cases in which one of the premises 
is cut down to a simple universal 

 the rules of contraversion remain unaltered thus 
xoyoz is the same as xoyoz c 

 the following exercises will exemplify what precedes 
letters written under one another are names of the same object 
here is a universe of instances of which are xs and the 
remainder ps are ys and the remainder qs are zs and 
the remainder rs 

p p p p p 
q q q q q 
r r r r r 

we can thus verify the eight complex syllogisms 
xyz pyz pqz p

in every case it will be seen that the two lots in the middle form

 the propositions hitherto enunciated are cumular each 
one is a collection of individual propositions or of propositions 
about individuals xy is all xs are some ys this pro 
position is an aggregate of singular propositions 



 exemplar proposition 

 there is a choice between this cumular mode of con 
ception and one which may be called exemplar in which each 
proposition is the premise of a unitsyllogism as this x is one 
y f this x is not any y the distinction is seen in a ii men 
are animals and every man is an animal propositions of the 
same import of which the first sums up the second tells off 
instance by instance in the second every is synonymous with 
each and with any 

 the late sir william hamilton entertained the idea of completing the 
system of enunciation by making the words all or when grammatically 
necessary any and some do every kind of duty he thus put forward as 
the system the following collection 



affirmative 

 all x is all y 

 all x is some y xy 

 some x is all y xy 

 some x is some y xqy 



negative 

 any x is not any y xy 

 any x is not some y xy 

 some x is not any y xy 

 some x is not some y 



of the two propositions which are not in the common system and 
the first note f is x y compounded of xy and xy it is 
contradicted by xy and xy either or both the second is true 
in all cases in which either x or y has two or more instances in existence 
its contrary is x and y are singular and identical there is but one x 
there is but one y and x is y a system of propositions which mixes the 
simple and the complex which compounds two of its own set to make a third 
in one case and one only and which offers an assertion and denial 
which cannot be contradicted in the system seems to me to carry its own 
condemnation written on its own forehead from this system i was led to 
the exemplar system in the text for sir w hamiltons defence of his own 
views and objections to mine see his discussions on philosophy c appen 
dix b in making this reference however it is due to myself to warn the 
reader who has not access to the paper criticised that sir w hamilton did 
not read with sufficient attention partly no doubt from ill health the 
consequence is that i must not be held answerable for all that is represented 
by him as coming from me for example speaking of my table of exemplar 
propositions he says and mark in what terms it the table of exemplars 
is ushered in as a system nay so lucid does it seem to its inventor 
that after the notation is detailed we are told that it needs no explanation 
the paragraph here criticised had two notations one of which i called the 
detailed notation because there is more detail in it than in the other the 
other is the old notation augmented the first had been sufficiently ex 
plained in what preceded the second was as to the augmentations new to 
the reader accordingly the table being finished i proceeded thus the 
detailed notation needs no explanation the form given to the old notation 

may be explained thus sir w hamilton represented me as saying 

that after the notation all the notation i suppose is detailed it table or 
notation i know not which needs no explanation i select this small point 



 exemplak proposition 

as one that can be briefly dealt with there are many more which i shall 
probably never notice unless it be one at a time as occasion of illustration 
arises a very decisive case is exposed in the postscript of my third paper in 
the cambridge transactions 

 quantity is now replaced by mode of selection there is 
unlimited selection expressed by the word any one vaguely limited 
selection expressed by some one when we say some one we 
mean that we do not know it may be any one 

 let x and x now mean any one x let x and x 
mean some one x 

 the propositions are as follows the first of each pair 
being a universal the second its contrary particular 

exemplar form cumular form 

xy any one x is any one y x and y singular and identical 

xy some one x is not some one eitherx not singular or y not singu 
y lar or if both singular not identical 

xy any one x is some one y all xs are some ys 

x y some one x is not any one y some xs are not all ys 

xy some one x is any one y some xs are all ys 

x y any one x is not some one y all xs are not some ys 

xy any one x is not any one y all xs are not all ys 
xy some one x is some one y some xs are some ys 

six of the forms of this exemplar system are identical with six 
of the forms of the cumular system and these six forms are the 
forms of the old logic if we take care always to read xy and 
xy backwards and to count xy and xy as each a 
pair of propositions by distinguishing the reading forwards from 
the reading backwards 

 the two new forms of the exemplar system the first and 
second above come under the same symbols as the two new 
forms of the cumular system and but the meanings are 
widely different both systems contain every possible combi 
nation of quantities as well in universal as in particular pro 
positions 

 if the above propositions be applied to contraries we have 
a more extensive system of propositions i shall not enter on this 
enlargement because the peculiar proposition of this system 
xy is of infrequent use in thought as connected with the 
consideration of x and y in opposition to their contraries 

 all necessary laws of thought are part of the subject of logic but a 
small syllabus cannot contain everything the rejection from logic and the 
rejection from a book of logic are two very different things it has not been 

d 



 exemplar syllogism 

uncommon to repudiate rare and unusual forms from the science itself by 
calling them subtleties or the like this is not reasonable but as 
to the contents of a work especially of a syllabus the time must come at 
which any one who asks for more inust be answered by 

cum tibi sufficiant cyathi cur dolia quaeris 

as another example i have required that no term shall be intro 
duced which fills the whole universe in common logic with an unlimited 
universe there is really no name as extensive as the universe except object 
of thought but it is otherwise in the limited universes which i suppose 
a short and easy chapter on names as extensive as the universe might be 
needed in a full work on logic but not in a syllabus 

 to make a syllogism of valid inference it is enough that 
there be at least one unlimited selection of the middle term and 
at least one affirmative proposition and the inference is obtained 
by dropping all the symbols of the middle term thus xyz 
shows premises which give the conclusion xz or some one 
x is any one y and some one y is not some one z giving some 
one x is not some one z 

 there are valid forms of syllogism as follows read 
ing each symbol both backwards and forwards but not counting 
it twice when it reads backwards and forwards the same as in 

xx 

fifteen in which x is joined with itself or another 

xx xx 

fifteen in which the syllogism is but an exemplar reading of 
a cumular syllogism 

 ox 

six which give the conclusion 

 oo 

 if sir william hamiltons system be taken there are also valid 
forms of syllogism the same as in the text but the law of inference is 
slightly modified as follows when both the middle spicula turn one way 
as in and then any spicula of universal quantity which turns the other 
way must itself be turned unless it be protected by a negative point thus 
 which in the exemplar system gives in the cumular system 
gives 



exemplar system 
any one x is any one y 
some one y is some one z 
therefore any one x is some one z 



cumular system 
all xs are all ys 
some ys are some zs 
therefore some xs are some zs 



this distinction will afford useful study the minor premise of the exem 
plar instance implies that there is but one x and one y 



 numerically definite syllogism 

 the exemplar proposition is not unknown it is of very 
frequent use in complete demonstration when euclid proves 
that every triangle has angles together equal to two right angles 
he selects or allows his reader to select a triangle and shows 
that any triangle has angles equal to two right angles and the 
force of demonstration is for those who can see that the selection 
is not limited by anything in the reasoning the exemplar form 
of enunciation then is of at least as frequent use in purely 
deductive reasoning as any other and is therefore fitly intro 
duced even into a short syllabus in any case it is a subject of 
logical consideration as being an actual fonn of thought 

 the limitation of the selection by some detail of process is one of the 
errors against which the geometer has especially to guard i remember an 
asserted trisection of the angle which i examined again and again and again 
without being able to detect a single offence against euclids conditions at 
last in the details of a very complex construction i found two requirements 
which were only possible togtther on the supposition of a certain triangle 
having its vertex upon the base now it happened that one of the angles 
at the base of this triangle was the very angle to be trisected so that the 
author had indeed trisected an angle but not any angle he had most satis 
factorily and by no help but euclids geometry divided the angle into 
three equal parts a modification of his process would have been 
equally successful with which euclid himself had trisected 

 the following passage written by sir wrlliam hamilton 
himself should be quoted in every logical treatise for it ought 
to be said and cannot be said better whatever is operative in 
thought must be taken into account and consequently be overtly 
expressible in logic for logic must be as to be it professes an 
unexclusive reflex of thought and not merely an arbitrary selec 
tion a series of elegant extracts out of the forms of thinking 
whether the form that it exhibits as legitimate be stronger or 
weaker be more or less frequently applied that as a material 
and contingent consideration is beyond its purview 

 the heads of the numerically definite proposition and 
syllogism are as follows 

let u be the whole number of individuals in the universe 
let x y z be the numbers of xs ys and zs then u x uy 
u z are the numbers of xs ys and zs 

 on this subject i have given only heads of result the demonstrations 
of which will be found in my formal logic 

 let mxy mean that m or more xs are ys then mxy 
means that m or more xs are ys or not ys and wiyx and 
myx have the same meanings as tnxy and wxy 



 numerical proposition and syllogism 

 let a proposition be called spurious when it must of 
necessity be true by the constitution of the universe thus in a 
universe of instances of which are xs and are ys the 
proposition xy is spurious for at least xs must be ys 
and xy cannot be denied and need not be affirmed as that 
which might be denied 

 let every negative quantity be interpreted as thus 
 xy means that none or more xs are ys a spurious pro 
position 

 the quantification of the predicate is useless to say 
that mxs are to be found among nys is no more than is said in 
raxy to say that raxs are not any one to be found among any 
lot of nys is a spurious proposition unless m n be greater than 
both x and y in which case it is merely equivalent to both of the 
following m n y xy and m n yx which are equi 
valent to each other 

 in raxy the spurious part if any is x y wxy 
the part which is not spurious is m u x xy for each 
instance in the last there must be an x which is y the follow 
ing pairs of propositions are identical 

m xy and mu x y xy 
mxy and my t xy 
m xy and m x y xy 
wixy and mxy m xy 

 



their contraries 

xlm xy yl m xy 

xl tw xy ulymxy 

ul arm xy y lwi xy 



identical propositions 
to xy mu x y xy 
m xy my x xy 
m xy mx y xy 
i xy mxy u xy 

 from mxy and wyz we infer in ny xz or its 
equivalent m n u a y zxz the four following forms 
include all the cases of syllogism the first two columns show the 
premises the second two the identical conclusions 

m xy n yz mn y xz mnu xyz xz 

m xy i yz mn x xz mnz xz 

m xy n yz mn z xz mn x xz 

 m xy n yz mny x z xz mny wxz 



 when either of the concluding terms is changed into its 
contrary the corresponding changes are made in the forms of 
inference thus to find the inference from mxy and wyz we 



 numerically definite proposition 

must in the fourth form write x for x z for z x for x z for z 
u x for x and u z for z 

 a spurious premise gives a spurious conclusion and 
premises neither of which is spurious may give a spurious con 
clusion a proposition is only spurious as it is known to be 
spurious hence when u x y z are not known there are no 
spurious propositions 

 every proposition has two forms one of names contrary 
to the other both spurious or neither whenever xy is true 
in a manner which by the constitution of the universe might 
have been false then xy or xy is also true in the same 
manner the ordinary syllogism would have two such contra 
nominal forms of one conclusion and properly speaking has two 
such forms when the conclusion is universal we know it has 
them for xz is xz xz is xz c these we may see 
to be the contranominal conclusions of the numerical syllogism 
for xy is xy and yz is yyz whence orxz and 
xy y u x xz or xz whichis xz and u z xz 
which is xz again let xy be wxy then yz being 
yz we have my xz or mxz and m u x z xz 
its equivalent if x z u be known then if m xz be any thing 
except what must be we have m ux z and m ux z xz 
is x z or xz as it is x y u being unknown we have raxz 
certainly true be it spurious or not and we can say nothing 
of mu x z xz 

 syllogisms with numerically definite quantity rarely occur 
if ever in common thought but syllogisms of transposed quan 
tity occur in which the number of instances of one term is the 
whole possible number of instances of another term for example 
c for every z there is an x which is y some zs are not 
ys here we have zxy and wyz whence z n xz and 
zn xz the first is wxz a case of xz some xs are 
not zs thus for every man in the house there is a person 
who is aged some of the men are not aged it follows and 
easily that some persons in the house are not men but not by 
any common form of syllogism 

 of terms in common use the only one which can give the 
syllogisms of this chapter is e most as in 

most ys are xs most ys are zs therefore some xs are zs 
most ys are xs most ys are not zs therefore some xs are 
not zs 



 



figure convertibility transitiveness 



most ys are not xs most ys are not zs therefore some 
things are neither xs nor zs 

 each one of our syllogisms may be stated in eight 
different ways each premise and the conclusion admitting two 
different orders thus xy yz giving xz may be stated 
as yx yz giving zx or as xy yz giving zx c 
all the orders are as follows 



i 

xy yz xz 
yx zy zx 



ii 

xy zy xz 
xy zy zx 



iii 

yx yz xz 
yx yz zx 



iv 

yx zy xz 
xy yz zx 



 whenever there is a first and a second let them be called 
minor and major write the premises so that the minor premise 
shall contain the minor term of the conclusion though it has 
long been most common to write the major premise first and 
we have 



i 
xy yz 



xz 



xy 



ii 
zy 



xz 



iii 
yx yz xz 



iv 
yx zy xz 



these orders are called the four figures thus xy yz 
giving xz is stated in the first figure xy zy giving 
xz is stated in the second figure yx yz giving xz is 
stated in the third figure yx zy giving xz is stated in 
the fourth figure 

 the first figure may be called the figure of direct transi 
tion the fourth which is nothing but the first with a converted 
conclusion the figure of inverted transition the second the figure 
of reference to the middle term the third the figure of reference 
from the middle term 

 the first figure is the one which has been used in our 
symbols and it is the most convenient the distinction of 
figure is wholly useless in this tract so far as we have yet 
gone it becomes necessary when we take a wider view of the 
copula 

 a convertible copula is one in which the copular relation 
exists between two names both ways thus is fastened to is 
joined by a road with is equal to is in habit of conversation 
with c are convertible copulse if x is equal to y then y 
is equal to x c 

 a transitive copula is one in which the copular relation 
joins x with z whenever it joins x with y and y with z thus 
 is fastened to is usually understood as a transitive copula x 



 extension of copula 

is fastened to y and y is fastened to z give x is fastened

 all the copulas used in this syllabus are transitive the intransitive 
copula cannot be treated without more extensive consideration of the combi 
nation of relations than i have now opportunity to give a second part of 
this syllabus or an augmented edition may contain something on this 
subject 

 the junction of names by appiirtenance to one object the 
copula hitherto used is both convertible and transitive and from 
these qualities and from these alone it derives the whole of its 
functional power in syllogism any copula which is both transi 
tive and convertible will give precisely the syllogisms of our 
system and no others provided always that if contrary names 
be introduced no instance of a name can either directly or by 
transition be joined by the copula with any instance of the con 
trary name for example let the copula be some transitive and 
convertible mode of joining or fastening together whether of 
objects in space or notions in the rnind c so that no x is ever 
joined with any x c the following are two instances of 
syllogism 

xyz every x is joined to a y no y is joined to a z 
therefore no x is joined to a z for if any x were joined to a z 
that z would be joined to an x and that x to a y whence that 
z would be joined to a y which no z is 

xyz everything is joined either to an x or to a y 
some things are joined neither to ys nor to zs therefore some 
xs are not joined to zs for if every x were joined to a z 
then every thing being by the first premise joined either to an 
x or to a y is joined either to a z or to a y which contradicts 
the second premise 

 the logicians are aware that many cases exist in which inference about 
two terras by comparison with a third is not reducible to their syllogism 
as a equals b b equals c therefore a equals c this is not an instance 
of common syllogism the premises are a is an equal of b b is an equal 
of c so far as common syllogism is concerned that an equal of b 
is as good for the argument as b is a material accident of the meaning of 
 equal the logicians accordingly to reduce this to a common syllogism 
state the effect of composition of relation in a major premise and declare 
that the case before them is an example of that composition in a minor 
premise as in a is an equal of an equal of c every equal of an equal is 
an equal therefore a is an equal of c this i treat as a mere evasion 
among various sufficient answers this one is enough men do not think as 
above when a b b c is made to give a c the word equals is a 



 extension of copula 

copula in thought and not a notion attaejied to a predicate there are 
processes which are not those of common syllogism in the logicians major 
premise above but waiving this logic is an analysis of the form of thought 
possible and actual and the logician has no right to declare that other than 
the actual is actual 

 the convertibility of the copula renders the inference 
altogether independent of figure 

 let the copula be inconvertible as in x precedes y 
from which we cannot say that y precedes x we must now 
introduce the converse relation y follows x and the conversion 
of a proposition requires the introduction of the converse copula 

 this extension when contraries are also introduced is 
almost unknown in the common run of thought but it may serve 
for exercise and also to give an idea of one of those innumerable 
systems of relation with which thought unassisted by systematic 
analysis would probably never become familiar 

 the uneducated acquire easy and accurate use of the very simplest 
cases of transformation of propositions and of syllogism the educated 
by a higher kind of practice arrive at equally easy and accurate use of some 
more complicated cases but not of all those which are treated in ordinary 
logic euclid may have been ignorant of the identity of every x is y and 
 every noty is notx for any thing that appears in his writings he makes 
the one follow from the other by new proof each time the followers of 
aristotle worked aristotles syllogism into the habits of the educated world 
giving not indeed anything that demonstrably could not have been acquired 
without system but much that very probably would not the modern 
logician appeals to the existing state of thought in proof of the completeness 
of the ordinary system he cannot see anything in an extension except what 
he calls a subtlety in the same manner a country whose school of arith 
metical teachers had never got beyond counting with pebbles would be able 
to bring powerful arguments against pen ink and paper the arabic 
numerals and the decimal system they would point to society at large 
getting on well enough with pebbles and able to do all their work with such 
means for it is an ascertained fact that all which is done by those to whom 
pebbles are the highest resource is done either with pebbles or something 
inferior i have long been of opinion that the reason why common logic is 
lightly thought of by the mass of the educated world is that the educated 
world has in a rough way arrived at some use of those higher developments 
of thought which that same common logic has never taken into its compass 
kant said that the study of a legitimate subtlety necessary but infrequent 
law of though sharpens the intellect but is of no practical use sharpen 
the intellect with it until it is familiar and it will then become of practical 
use a law of thought a necessary part of the machinery of our minds of 
no practical use whose fault is that 

 let any two names be connected by transitive converse 
relations for an example say gives to and receives from under 



 transitive and inconveetible copula 



 



standing that when x gives to y and y gives to z x gives to z 
in the following way 

no x gives to another x either directly or transitively c 
every x either gives to a y or receives from a y but not both 
every x either gives to a y or receives from a y but not both 
every x which gives to a y receives from no other y c 

the same of all combinations of names as y with x and x c 

 the following are the propositions used with their 
symbols and in a corresponding way for any other copula which 
may be used 



xy every x gives to a y 
xy some xs give to no ys 
xy no x gives to a y 
xy some xs give to ys 
x y in every relation something 
either gives to an x or re 
ceives from a y or both 
xy in some relations nothing 
gives to any x nor receives 
from any y 

xy some xs give to all the ys 
xy all xs do not give to some 
ys 



xy every x receives from a y 
xy some xs receive from no ys 
xy no x receives from a y 
xqy some xs receive from ys 
xy in every relation something 

either receives from an x 

or gives to a y or both 
xy in some relations nothing 

receives from any x nor 

gives to any y

some ys 



 propositions are changed into others identical with them by 
this addition to the rule in when one term is contraverted 
the relation is also converted when both the relation remains

the relations may be converted throughout 

 to prove an instance how do we know that xy is 
identical with xy if every x give to a y the remaining 
ys if any do not give to any xs by the assigned conditions of 
meaning consequently those remaining ys receive from xs as 
to ys none of them can give to xs for then they would give to 
ys therefore all receive from xs conversely if xy no x 
can receive from y for then neither could that y receive from 
x nor could that x give to y so that there would be a relation 
in which neither does any thing give to y nor receive from x 
consequently every x gives to y 



 syllogism of inconveetible copula 

 let the phases of a figure depend on the quality of the 
premises in the following manner meaning affirmative and 
negative remember the phases in the following order 

 for the four figures let these four phases be the first or 

primary phases thus h is the primary phase of the third 

figure to put the other phases in order read backwards from 
the primary phases and then forwards 

 

figure i 

ii 

iii 



thus is the third phase of the second figure 

 in the primary phases the direct copula may be used 
throughout when one premise departs from the primary phase 
in quality the converse copula must be used in the other when 
both in the conclusion this addition is all that is required in the 
treatment of the syllogism of inconvertible copula 

 thus the premises being xy zy we have the 
primary phase of the second figure whence xz with the direct 
copula that is if no x give to a y and every z give to a y 
no x gives to a z for if any x gave to a z that z giving to 
a y that x would give to a y which no x does now con 
travert the middle term and we have xy zy the phase of 
the second figure in which both premises differ from the primary 
phase hence every x gives y no z gives y yields no x is 
given by z for if any x were given by z a y would be given 
by that z which is given by no z but no x gives z will 
not do 

 the reader may exercise himself in the formation of more examples 
the use of such a developement as the one before him is this every study 
of a generalisation or extension gives additional power over the particular 
form by which the generalisation is suggested nobody who has ever 
returned to quadratic equations after the study of equations of all degrees 
or who has done the like will deny my assertion that o l irti ftxinav may 
be predicated of any one who studies a branch or a case without afterwards 
making it part of a larger whole accordingly it is always worth while to 
generalise were it only to give power over the particular this principle of 
daily familiarity to the mathematician is almost unknown to the logician 

 the common system of syllogism which being nearly 
complete in the writings of aristotle may be called aristotelian 



 aeistotelian syllogism 

is as much as may be collected out of the preceding system by 
the following modifications 

 the exclusion of all idea of a limited universe of contrary 
names and of the propositions and the exclusion of 
all right to convert a proposition except when its two terms have 
like quantities as in and thus xy must not be read as 
 some ys are all xs but xy may undergo what is called 
the conversion per accidens that is xy affirming x y which 
is yx xy may be made to give yqx the exclusion 
of every copula except the transitive and convertible copula 

 the addition of the consideration of the identical pairs xy 
and yx xy and yx as perfectly distinct propositions 

 the introduction of the distinction of figure the writing 
of the major and minor propositions first and second instead of 
second and first thus xyz is written yz xy whence 



 there are four forms of proposition a or xy or 
yx not identical e or xy or yx identical i or 
xy or yx identical o or xy or yx not identical 

 there are four fundamental syllogisms in the first figure 
each of which has an opponent in the second and an opponent in 
the third there are three fundamental syllogisms in the fourth 
figure each of which has the other two for opponents alto 
gether fifteen fundamental syllogisms there are three strength 
ened particular syllogisms two in the third figure and one in the 
fourth and one weakened universal in the fourth figure in all 
nineteen forms 

 every syllogism has a word attached to it the vowels of 
which are those of its premises and conclusion in the first figure 
the consonants are all unmeaning in the other figures some of 
the consonants give direction as to the manner of converting into 
the first figure thus k denotes that the syllogism cannot be 
directly converted into the first figure though its opponent in the 
first figure may be used to force its conclusion s means that 
the premise whose vowel precedes is to be simply converted p 
which occurs in all the strengthened particulars and the weakened 
universal means that the conversion per accidens is to be employed 
on the preceding member m means that the premises must be 
transposed in order each syllogism converts into that syllogism 
of the first figure which has the same initial letter g is an 
addition of my own presently described it must be left out when

 the best attainable exposition of logic in the older form with modern 
criticism is mr mansels edition of aldrichs compendium should a reader

eight editions were published in the seventeenth century from to

the older logic in the lustitutiones logicce of burgersdicius and a great 
quantity of the metaphysical discussion connected with the old logic in

 names subjective and objective 

premise receives from a y that x would receive from a y which 
contradicts the first premise 

 in the preceding articles i have considered hardly any 
thing but mere assertion or denial of concomitance of any sort or 
kind whatsoever i now proceed to more specially subjective 
views of logic 

o 

 a term or name may be in one word or in many it 
describes pictures represents but does not assert nor deny its 
object must exist whether in thought only or in external nature 
as well and everything which does not contradict the laws of 
thought may be the object of a term but sometimes the thinkers 
universe will be the whole universe of thought sometimes only 
the objective universe of external reality sometimes only a part 
of one or the other 

 terms are used in four different senses two objective 
directed towards the external object or to use old phrases of first 
intention or representing first notions two subjective directed 
towards the internal mind of second intention or representing 
second notions 

 in objective use the name represents the individual 
object unconnected with and unaggregated with any other object 
of the same name the individual quality forming part of and 
residing in the individual object one name may at different 
times represent both thus animal the name of an object is the 
name of a quality of man in fact quality is but object con 
sidered as component of another object the quality white a 
component of the notion of an ivory ball is itself an object of 
thought 

 the objective uses of names have been considered as 
the bases of propositions and syllogisms in the preceding part of 
this tract 

 the ordinary syllogism of the logicians literally taken as laid down 
by them is objective of first intention arithmetical i call it the logicians 
abacus when the educated man rejects its use and laughs at the idea of 
introducing such learned logic into his daily life i hold his refusal to be in 
most cases right and his reason to be entirely wrong he has and his peers 
always have had some command of the subjective syllogism the combination 
of relations to which i shall come he has no more occasion in most cases 
to have recourse to the logical abacus for his reasoning than to the 
chequer board or arithmetical abacus for adding up his bills i hold the 
combination of relations to be the actual organ of reasoning of the world at 
large and as such worthy of having its analysis made a part of advanced 



 class and attribute 

education the logicians abacus being a fit and desirable occupation for 
childhood 

 in subjective use the name represents a class a 
collection of individual objects named after a quality which is in 
thought as being in each one an attribute the notion of 
quality as it exists in the mind to be given to a class attribute 
is to individual quality what class is to individual object 
between the notion of a class and the notion of an object though 
the name be the same in both cases there is this distinction the 
classname belongs to a number of objects the object belongs to 
a number of classnames for it may be named after any one of 
its qualities we have classes aggregated of many objects and 
objects compounded of many classes but in this second case the 
object is said to have many qualities the class is a whole of one 
kind the object is a whole of another kind this distinction 
emerges the moment a name begins to be a universal that is 
belonging to more than one object 

 class and attribute are units of thought a noun of 
multitude is not a multitude of nouns when we are fortunate 
enough to get four distinct names we readily apprehend all these 
distinctions this happens in the case of our own species the 
objects men all having the quality human give to the thought 
the class mankind distinguished from other classes by the attri 
bute humanity should any reader object to my account of the 
four uses of a name he can without rejection of anything else in 
what follows substitute his own account of the four words man 
human mankind humanity 

 with grounds of classification and reasons for nomen 
clature logic has nothing to do any number of individuals 
whether yet unclassed or included in one class or partly in one 
class and partly in another may be constituted a new class in 
right of any quality seen in all by which an attribute is affixed 
to the class in the mind 

 the term x or y or z may and does denote at one 
time or another the individual the quality the class or the 
attribute any one who finds the distinction useful might think 
of the individual x the quality xic the class xkind and the 
attribute xity 

 identical terms are those which apply to precisely the 
same objects of thought neither representing more than the other 



 umvekse contkaries 

so that identical terms are different names of the same class 
thus for this earth man and rational animal are identical terms 
the symbol xy will be used to represent that x and y 
are identical when of two identical terms one the known is 
used to explain the other the unknown the first is called the 
definition of the second 

 the whole extent of matter of thought under consider 
ation i call the universe in common logic hitherto the universe 
has always been the whole universe of possible thought 

 every term which is used divides the universe 
into two classes one within the term the other without these 
i call contraries and i denote the contrary class of x the class 
notx by x when the universe is unlimited contrary names 
are of little effective use notman a class containing every thing 
except man whether seen or thought is almost useless it is 
otherwise in a limited universe in which contraries by separate 
definiteness of meaning cease to be mere negations each of the 
other and even acquire separate and positive names thus the 
universe being property under english law real and personal are 
contrary classes logic has nothing to do with the difficulties of 
allotment which take place near the boundary with the decision 
upon those personals for example which as the lawyer says 
savour of the realty the lawyer must determine the classifi 
cation and logic investigates the laws of thought which then 
apply if the lawyer choose to make an intermediate class 
between real and personal then real and personal are no longer 
logical contraries 

that x and y are contrary classes is denoted by 



 the most amusing instance which ever came within my own knowledge 
is as follows a friend of mine in the days of the irish church bill used 
to discuss politics with his butcher one day he alluded to the possible fate 
of the establishment do you mean do away with the church asked the 
butcher yes said my friend that is what they say why sir how 
can that be was the answer dont you see sir that if they destroy the 
church we shall all have to be dissenters 

 terms may be formed from other terms 

 by aggregation when the complex term stands for every 
thing to which any one or more of the simple terms applies thus 
animal is the aggregate of the aggregants man and brute 

 by composition when the complex term stands but for 



 aggregation and composition 

everything to which all the simple terms apply thus man is 
compounded of the components animal and rational 
 by mixture of these two methods of formation 

 the reader must carefully remember that we are now engaged 
especially upon the esse quod habent in anima and if not accustomed to 
middle latin he must remember also that esse is made a substantive mode 
of being animal cannot be divided into man and brute except in a mind 
logical composition must be distinguished from physical or metaphysical 
light always consisted of the prismatic components but before newton it 
was not a logical quality of light that it is to be conceived as decomposible 
accordingly a compound of qualities though it may constitute a full dis 
tinctive definition of an object of thought can never be accepted as a full 
description there may be many more the logician therefore must in 
thinking of a compound imitate the genial dean aldrich the author of the 
compendium of logic to which so many have been indebted in the structure 
of his fifth reason for drinking 

 the aggregate of x y z will be represented by 
x y z the term compounded of x y z will be represented 
by xyz or xyz 

 the aggregate name belongs to each of the aggregants 
but the compound name does not belong to each of the com 
ponents necessarily 

 an aggregate is not impossible if either of its aggregants 
be impossible or if two of them be contradictory but a compound 
is impossible in either of these cases 

 in these and all other formulae care must be taken to 
remember that the logical phrase implies nothing the phrases of 
ordinary conversation frequently imply in addition to what they 
express thus some living men breathe and every man is 
either animal or mineral are colloquially false by what they 
imply but logically true because the logical use implies nothing 

 a class may be compounded of classes as well as aggre 
gated thus the class marine is compounded of the classes soldier 
and sailor an attribute may be aggregated of attributes as well 
as compounded thus adam smiths attribute productive is ag 
gregated of landtilling manufacturing c but composition of 
classes and aggregation of attributes are infrequent any name 
may be thought of either as a class or an attribute or character 
as it is often called and it is usual and convenient to think of 
class when aggregation is in question and of attribute when com 
position is in question so we rather say the marine unites the 
cfiaracters of the soldier and the sailor the productive classes as 



 extension and intension 

adam smith said consist of farmers manufacturers c but 
all this for convenience not of necessity and the power of un 
learning usual habits must be acquired all modes of thought 
should be considered the usual because they are usual the 
unusual that they may become usual 

 the words of aggregation are either or of composition 
both and thus x y is either x or y or both xy is both 
x and y 

 the more classes aggregated so long as each class has 
something not contained in any of the others the greater the 
extension of the aggregate term the more attributes com 
pounded so long as each attribute has some component not 
contained in the others the greater the intension animal has 
more extension than man man has more intension than 
animal 

 the logicians have always spoken of all men as constituting the 
extent of the term man thus the whole extent of man is part of the extent 
of animal they have chosen that their more and less should be referred to 
by phrases derived rather from the notion of area than from that of number 
hence arise certain forms of speech which when quantity is applied to the 
predicate are not idiomatic as all man is some animal 

there are savage tribes which have not sufficient idea of number even 
for their own purposes among them when a dozen or more of men are to be 
indicated an area sufficient to contain them is marked out on the ground 
the speculative philosophers of the middle ages were in something like the 
same position though the mercantile world was well accustomed to large 
numbers the philosophical world excepting only some of the mathematicians 
was very awkward at high numeration the works on theoretical arithmetic 
show this well i have been straining my eye over the twelve books of the 
arithmetical speculativa of gaspar lax of arragon paris folio to 
detect if i could a number higher than a hundred and i have found only 
one the date 

 the name of greatest extension and of least intension of 
which we speak is the universe 

 the contrary of an aggregate is the compound of the 
contraries of the aggregants either one of the two x y or both 
notx and noty either x y or xy the contrary of a 
compound is the aggregate of the contraries of the components 
either both x and y or one of the two notx and noty either 
xy or x y 

 the following are exercises on complex terms 

 both or neither and f one or the other not both are con 
traries that is xy xy and xy yx are contraries now 

f 



 proposition and judgment 

the contrary of the first is x yx y which is xx xy yx yy 
which is xy yx since xx y y are impossible 



xabc gives xabc 
xabcd xjabcd 
xabc xabc 



xabcd gives xabcd 
xabcdef xabcdef 
xabac xabc 



deduce these and explain the last 

 a term given in extension as a b c has its contrary 
given in intension abc and vice versa aggregates or com 
ponents of either only enable us to deduce components or aggre 
gates of the other 

 a proposition is the presentation for assertion or denial 
of two names connected by a relation as x in the relation l to 
y a judgment is the sentence of the mind upon a proposition 
certainly true more or less probable certainly false propositions 
without accompanying judgment hardly occur so that propo 
sition comes to mean by abbreviation proposition accompanied by 
judgment 

 the distinction between certainty and probability is 
usually treated apart from logic as a branch of mathematics a 
few of the leading results relative to authority and argument will 
be afterwards given 

 the purely formal proposition with judgment wholly 
void of matter is seen in there is the probability a that x is 
in the relation l to y from the purely formal proposition no 
inference can follow in all elementary logic the terms are 
formal the relation material and the judgment absolute assertion 
or denial or as a mathematician would say the probabilities 
considered are only and 

 the logician calls every man is animal a material instance of the 
formal proposition every x is y he will admit no relation to be formal 
except what can be expressed by the word is he declares all other relations 
material thus he will not consider x equals y under any form except 
 x is an equal of y he has a right to confine himself to any part he 
pleases buj he has no right except the right of fallacy to call that part the 
whole 

 contrary propositions are a pair of which one must be 
true and one false as he did he did not or as every x is 
y some xs are not ys contraries contradict one another 
but so do other propositions thus e all men are strong and 
 all men are weak contradict one another to the utmost the 
second says there is not a particle of truth in the first but the 
contrary merely says there is more or less falsehood to all men 



 inference and proof 

are strong the contrary is there are man or men who are not 
strong 

 in the usual nomenclature of logicians what i call the contrary is 
called the contradictory as if it were the only one in common language 
when two persons disagree we say they are on contrary sides of the question 
in the usual technical language of logic this would mean that if one should 
say all men are strong the other says no man is strong but in common 
language the one who maintains the contrary is he who advocates anything 
which the other is opposed to 

 every proposition has its contrary there is no assertion 
but has its denial no denial but has its assertion every logical 
scheme of propositions must contain a denial for every assertion 
and an assertion for every denial 

 inference is the production of one proposition as the 
necessary consequence of one or more other propositions in 
ference from one proposition may be either an equivalent or 
identical proposition or an inclusion if from a first proposition 
we can infer a second and if from the second proposition we can 
also infer the first the two propositions are logical equivalents 
thus x is the parent of y and y is the child of x are logical 
equivalents and also every x is y and every noty is 
notx but from every x is y we can infer f some xs are 
ys without being able to infer the first from the second the 
second is only included in the first 

 when inference is made from more than one proposition 
the result is called a conclusion and its antecedents premises 

 inference has nothing to do with the truth or falsehood 
of the antecedents but only with the necessity of the consequence 
when the inference from the antecedents is preceded by showing 
of their truth the whole is called proof or demonstration 

 deduction or a priori proof is when the compound of the 
premises gives the conclusion one false premise and deduction 
wholly fails 

 induction or a posteriori proof is when the aggregate of 
the premises gives the conclusion one false premise and the 
induction partially fails 

 absolute or mathematical proof is when the conclusion is 
so established that any contradiction would be a contradiction of 
a necessity of thought 

 logic considers the laws of action of thoiight mathematics applies 
these laws of thought to necessary matter of thought that two straight 
lines cannot inclose a space is a necessary way of thinking a proposition to 



 logic and mathematics 

which we must assent but it is not a law of action of thought that if two 
straight lines cannot inclose a space it follows that two lines which do 
inclose a space are not both straight is an example of a rule by which 
thought in action must be guided 

mathematics are concerned with necessary matter of thought let the 
mind conceive every thing annihilated which it can conceive annihilated and 
there will remain an infinite universe of space lasting through an eternity of 
duration and space and time are the fundamental ideas of mathematics 
of course then the logicians the students of the necessary action of thought 
are in close intellectual amity with the mathematicians the students of the 
necessary matter of thought it may be so but if so they dissemble their 
love by kicking each other down stairs in very great part the followers 
of either study despise the other the logicians are wise above mathematics 
the mathematicians are wise above logic of course with casual exceptions 
each party denies to the other the power of being useful in education at 
least each party affirms its own study to be a sufficient substitute for the 
other posterity will look on these purblind conclusions with the smile of 
the educated landholder of our day when he reads squire westerns fears 
lest the sinking fund should be sent to hanover to corrupt the english 
nation a generation will arise in which the leaders of education will know 
the value of logic the value of mathematics the value of logic in mathe 
matics and the value of mathematics in logic for the mind as for the

this antipathy of necessary law and necessary matter is modern very 
many of the most illustrious names in the history of logic are the names 
of known mathematicians especially those of the founders of systems and 
the communicators from one language or nation to another as aristotle 
plato averroes by report boethius albertus magnus by report ramus 
melancthon hobbes descartes leibnitz wolff kant c locke was a 
competent mathematician bacon was deficient for the consequences of 
which see a review of the recent edition of his work in the athenceum for 
sept and the two races which have founded the mathematics 
those of the sanscrit and greek languages have been the two which have 
independently formed systems of logic 

england is the country in which the antipathy has developed itself in 
greatest force modern oxford declared against mathematics almost to this 
day and even now affords but little encouragement modern cambridge to 
this day declares against logic these learned institutions are no fools 
whence it may be surmised that possibly they would be wiser if they were 
brayed in a mortar certainly if both were placed in the same mortar and 
pounded together 

 moral proof is when the conclusion is so established that 
any contradiction would be of that high degree of improbability 
which we never look to see upset in ordinary life among the 
most remarkable of moral proofs is that common case of induction 
in which the aggregants are innumerable and the conclusion 
being proved as to very many without a single failure the mind 



 alternatives relation 

feels confident that all the unexamined aggregants are as true 
as those which have been examined this is probable induction 
often confounded with logical induction 

 a proof may be mixed it may be deduction of which 
some components are inductively proved it may be induction of 
which some aggregants are deductively proved 

 failure of proof is not proof of the contrary 

 if any number of premises give a conclusion denial of 
the conclusion is denial of one or more of the premises if all but 
one of the premises be affirmed and the conclusion denied that 
one premise must be denied these two processes conclusion 
from premises and denial of one premise by denying the con 
clusion and affirming all the other premises may be called 
opponents 

 repugnant alternatives are propositions of which one 
must be true and one only if there be two sets of repugnant 
alternatives of the same number of propositions in each and if 
each of the first set give its own one of the second set for its 
necessary consequence then each of the second set also gives its 
own one of the first set as a necessary consequence thus if 
a b c be repugnant alternatives and also p q r and if p be 
the necessary consequence of a q of b r of c then a is the 
necessary consequence of p b of q c of r if p be true 
neither b nor c can be true for then q or r would be true 
which cannot be with p but one of the three a b c must 
be true therefore a is true and similarly for the other 
cases 

 a relation is a mode of thinking two objects of thought 
together a connexion or want of connexion denial of relation 
is another relation and the two are contraries the universe 
may have only a selection from all possible relations 

 the name in relation is the subject the name to which 
it is in relation is the predicate thus in mind acting upon 
matter mind is the subject matter the predicate acting upon is the 
relation when the relation is convertible subject and predicate 
are distinguished only by order of writing as in 

 all judgments asserted or denied relations may be 
reduced to assertion or denial of concomitance by coupling the 
predicate and the relation into one notion as in f mind is a thing 
acting on matter or mind is not a thing acting on matter in 
all works of logic the consideration of relation in general is 



 relation 

evaded by this transformation and the developement of the science 
is thereby altogether prevented 

 if x be in some relation to y y is therefore in some 
other relation to x each of these relations is the converse of the 
other converse relations are of identical effect and neither 
exists without the other in conversion the subject and pre 
dicate are transposed and usually change order of mention as in 

 x is master of y y is servant of x 

 when a relation is its own converse it is said to be 
simply convertible as in x has nothing in common with y 
and y has nothing in common with x or as in x is equal to 
y and y is equal to x 

 when the subject of one relation is made the predicate 
of another the first predicate may be made the predicate of a 
combined relation as in the master of the nephewofy that 
is themasterofthenephew of y 

 the most familiar relations are those which exist between one human 
being and another of which the relations of consanguinity and affinity have 
almost usurped the name relation to themselves but hardly a sentence can 
be written without expression or implication of other relations 

 a combined relation may have a separate name or it 
may not thus brother of parent has its own name uncle but 
friend of parent has no name which describes nothing else 

 a combined relation may be of limited meaning or it 
may not thus nonancestor of a descendant of z has a limit 
ation of meaning with reference to z he is certainly nonancestor 
of z but ancestor of a descendant of z has no such limitation 
any person may be the ancestor of a descendant of any other 

 when a relation combined with itself reproduces itself 
let it be called transitive as superior superior of superior is 
superior the same sort of superiority being meant throughout 
a transitive relation has a transitive converse thus inferior of 
inferior is inferior 

 relations are conceivable both in extension and in in 
tension both as aggregates and as compounds thus 

 child of the same parents with is aggregate of brother sister 
self the relation of whole to part has among its components 
 greater and of same substance with 

 if two relations combine into what is contained in 
a third relation then the converse of either of the two combined 
with the contrary of the third in the same order is contained in 



 relation identity 

the contrary of the other of the two thus the following three 
assertions are identically the same superior and inferior being 
taken as contraries that is absolute equality not existing let 
the combination be master of parent and the third relation 
 superior 

every master of a parent is a superior 
every servant of an inferior is a nonparent 
every inferior of a child is a nonmaster 

from either of these the other two follow this may be gene 
rally proved at present it will be sufficient to deduce one of the 
assertions before us from another assume the second from it 
follows that every parent is not any servant of an inferior and 
therefore if servant at all only servant of superior whence master 
of parent must be superior 

 this theorem ought to be called theorem k being in fact the theorem 
on which depends the process indicated by the letter k in the old 
memorial verses 

 the relation in which an object of thought stands 
to itself is called identity to every thing else difference every 
thing is itself nothing is anything but itself and any two things 
being thought of they are either the same or different and can be 
nothing except one or the other these principles enter into the 
distinction between truth and falsehood but cannot distinguish 
one truth from another they are antecedent to all nomen 
clature and to all decomposition 

 many acute writers affirm that syllogism can be evolved from and 
solely depends upon three principles identity a is a difference 
a is not nota thirdly excluded middle every thing either a or not a 
now syllogism certainly demands the perception of convertibility a is b 
gives b is a and of transitiveness a is b and b is c gives a is c are 
the two principles deducible from the three if so either by syllogism or 
without if by syllogism then syllogism before establishment upon the 
three principles is made to establish itself which of course is not valid 
consequently we must take the writers of whom i speak to hold that 
convertibility and transitiveness follow from the principles of identity 
difference and excluded middle without petitio principii when any one of 
them attempts to show how i shall be able to judge of the process as it is 
i find that others do not go beyond the simple assertion and that i myself 
can detect the petitio principii in every one of my own attempts until 
better taught i must believe that the two principles of identity and transi 
tiveness are not capable of reduction to consequences of the three and must 
be assumed on the authority of consciousness 

should i be wrong here should any logician succeed without assuming 
syllogism in deducing the syllogism of the identifying copula is from 



 identity onymatic relation 

what may be called the three principles of identification i shall then admit 
a completely established specific difference between the ordinary syllogism 
and others in which the copula though convertible and transitive is not the 
substantive verb i should expect in such an event to deduce the transi 
tiveness and convertibility of equals from a equals a a does not 
equal not a and every thing either equals a or not a where a is magni 
tude only 

 identity is agreement in every thing and difference in 
nothing complex objects of thought usually agree in some 
things and differ in others they get the same names in right 
of those points in which they agree and different names in right 
of those points in which they differ and thus all resemblances 
or agreements giving an agreement of names and all differences 
giving a difference of names all the forms of inference are capable 
of being evolved out of those forms in which nothing but con 
comitance or nonconcomitance of names is considered to 
 

 relations which have immediate reference to or are 
directly evolved from the application of names and the mode of 
thinking about names in connexion with objects named or with 
other names may be called onymatic relations 

 the logician has hitherto denied entrance to every relation which is 
not onymatic declaring all others to be material not formal when the 
distinction of matter and form is so clearly defined that it can be seen why 
and how no connexions are of the form of thought except those which i 
have called onymatic it will be time enough to attempt a defence of the 
introduction of other relations in the meantime looking at all that is 
commonly said upon the distinction of form and matter i am strongly 
inclined to suspect that there is nothing but a mere confusion of terms that 
is that when the logician speaks of the distinction of form and matter he 
means the distinction of onymatic and nononymatic dr thomson in his 
outlines sfc note observes that the philosophic value of the terms 
matter and form is greatly reduced by the confusion which seems invariably 
to follow their extensive use the truth is that the mathematician as yet 
is the only consistent handler of the distinction about which nevertheless 
he thinks very little the distinction of form and matter is more in the 
theory of the logician than in his practice more in the practice of the 
mathematician than in his theory 

 the only relation in which a name as a name can 
stand to an object is that of applicable or inapplicable 

 names may have many grammatical and etymological 
relations to one another but the only relations which are of any 
logical import are the relations in which they stand to one another 
arising out of the relations in which they stand to objects ac 



 mathematical and metaphysical delation 

cordingly we consider two names as having objects to which both 
apply or as both applying to nothing whatsoever 

 when x y z are individual names and we say x is 
y y is z therefore x is z we can but mean that in speaking of 
x and y we are speaking of one object of thought and the same of 
y and z so that in speaking of x and z we are speaking of one 
object the law of thought which acts in this inference is the 
transitiveness of the notion of concomitancy if x go with y 
and y go with z then x goes with z 

 when names denote classes the primary relation between 
them is that of containing and contained in the sense of aggregate 
and aggregant other relations spring out of this as will 
be seen this relation is mathematical in its character a class is 
made up of classes just as an area is made up of areas it is 
physically possible to connect the two aggregations we can 
imagine all men on one area and all brutes on another the 
aggregate of the areas contains the class animal the aggregate of 
man and brute 

 when names denote attributes the primary relation is 
that of containing and contained in the sense of compound and 
component this relation is metaphysical in its character 
the mode of junction of components is not mathematical but is a 
subject for metaphysical discussion though how that discussion 
may terminate is of no importance for logical purposes the 
manner in which the sources of the notion rational are combined 
with those of the notion animal in the object which is called man 
has nothing to do with the laws of thought under which the 
compound and the components are and must be treated 

 it is not uncommon among logical writers to declare that an attribute 
is the sum of the attributes which it comprehends that for example man 
completely described by the notions animal and rational conjoined is the 
sum of those notions this is quite a mistake let any one try to sum up 
animal and rational into man in the obvious sense and manner in which he 
sums up man and brute into animal the distinction of aggregation and 
composition very little noticed by logicians if at all runs through all cases 
of thought in mathematics it is seen in the distinction of addition and 
multiplication in chemistry in the distinction of mechanical mixture and 
chemical combination in an act of parliament in the distinction between 
and be it further enacted and provided always and so on 

hartley has more nearly than any other writer produced the notion of 
composition as distinguished from aggregation his compound idea has a 
force and meaning of its own which prevents our seeing the components in 
it just as to use his own illustration the smell of the compound medicine 

a 



 metaphysical notions and names 

overpowers the smells of the ingredients but even hartley represents the 
compound of a and b by a b 

 when the class x is contained in the class y as an 
aggregant the attribute y is contained in the attribute x as a 
component thus the class man is contained in the class animal 
the attribute animal is contained in the attribute man these 
two apparent contradictions are both true in their different senses 
say he is man you say he is in animal say he is man you say 
animal is in him class man is in class animal as aggregant 
in aggregate attribute animal is in attribute man as component 
in compound 

 in all things which do not depend on ourselves we learn 
to think of that which always happens as necessarily happening of 
that which always accompanies as being essential part of the 
essence part of the being this metaphysical notion is always in 
thought in one form or other whenever undeviating concomitance 
of one notion with another is established or supposed 

 upon this word may be said once for all what is to be said concerning 
the use of metaphysical terms in logic we have nothing to do with the 
way in which the mind comes to them our affair is with the way in which 
the mind works from them thus it is absolutely essential to the fitness of 
three straight lines to be the sides of a triangle that any two should be 
together greater than the third contradiction is inconceivable it is 
naturally essential to an apple to be round contradiction is unknown in 
nature it is commercially and conveniently essential to a teapot to have 
a handle any contradiction would be unsaleable and unusable in all 
these cases and whatever may be the force of the word essential the mode of 
inference is the same for the logical consequences of y being an essential of 
x are but those of y being always found whenever x is found why then 
do we not confine ourselves to this last notion leaving the character of the 
conjunction be it a necessity of thought a result of uncontradicted observa 
tion or a conventional arrangement c entirely out of view simply 
because by so doing we fail to make logic an analysis of the way in which 
men actually do think if men will be metaphysicians and metaphysicians 
they will be it must be advisable to treat the metaphysical views of the 
most common relations the onymatic in a system of logic the metaphysical 
notion is a natural growth of thought and children and uneducated persons 
are more strongly addicted to it than educated adults 

 out of these onymatic relations arise five different 
modes of enunciating the same proposition one of these the 
arithmetical already treated merely states or sums up an enu 
meration of concomitances or nonconcomitances as in every 
man is an animal or as in no man is a vegetable 



 varieties of enunciation 

 the four subjective modes of speaking which the notions 
of relation develope are 

 mathematical here both subject and predicate are notions 
of class the class man contained in the class animal 

 physical the subject a class the predicate an attribute 
as in man is mortal the class man has the attribute subject to 
death 

 metaphysical both subject and predicate are notions of 
attributes as in humanity is fallible fallibility a component of 
the notion humanity 

 contraphysical the subject an attribute the predicate a 
class as in all mortality in the class man or none but men 
are mortal that is we must attribute mortality only in the class 
man or all of which mortality is the attribute is in the class 
man 

 i take a falsehood for once to remind the reader that with truth or 
falsehood of matter we have nothing to do 

 all these niodes of reading are concomitant each one of 
the five gives all the rest if all the men in the universe be so 
many animals then the class man is in the class animal and has 
the attribute animal as one of its class marks also the attribute 
animal is an essential of the attribute humanity and the attribute 
humanity is to be sought only in the class animal 

 according to the universe understood so is the mode of taking the 
meaning of the ouymatic terms for example if the universe be the 
universe of objective reality then all existing men being ascertained to be 
animals it is of the nature of man as actually created to be animal the 
attributes of animal are naturally essential to man if the universe be the 
universe of all possible thought then if all men conceivable be animals if 
for whatever reason it be impossible to think of man without thinking of 
animal then the attribute animal is an essential of the attribute humanity 
and now arises a question of words with which logic has nothing to do 
those creatures of thought which occur in the fables dogs and oxen c 
which are rational as well as animal are they men f certainly not according 
to the notion which the word represents consequently the phrase rational 
animal is a larger term than man when all the possibilities of thought are 
in question but this is not a question of logic the logician as such does 
not know what man is nor what animal is but he knows how to combine 
every man is animal with other propositions so soon as he knows that he 
is permitted to use that proposition 

 we have now to render the proposition and the syllogism 
into the four readings mathematical metaphysical or mixed in 



 mathematical proposition 

venting appropriate terms for all the relations which occur it 
will be sufficient however to treat the first and third system the 
wholly mathematical and the wholly metaphysical 

 when every x is y xy or yx let the class x be 
called a species of the class y and y a genus of x in the con 
trary case when some xs are not ys xy or yx let x be 
an exient of y and y a deficient of x 

 in the common use of these words the species is a part only of 
the genus as here used the species may be the whole genus this is 
to my mind the greatest liberty i have taken with the ordinary terms of 
logic 

 when no x is y xy or yx let each class be 
called an external of the other or let the two be called coexternals 
in the contrary case when some xs are ys xy or yx 
let each be called a partient of the other or let the two be called 
copartients 

 when every thing is either x or y xy or yx 
let each class be called a complement of the other in the contrary 
case when some things are neither xs nor ys x y or yx let 
each class be called a coinadequate of the other 

 punsters are respectfully informed that the reading coinadequate and 
all jokes legitimately deducible therefrom are already appropriated and the 
right of translation reserved 

 the spicular symbols may be made to stand for the 
relations themselves thus means species or genus according 
as it is read forwards or backwards genus or species and so 
on 

 genus and species are converse relations as also exient 
and deficient of external partient complement coinadequate each 
is its own converse genus and deficient are contrary relations 
as are species and exient external and partient complement and 
coinadequate 

 genus is both partient and coinadequate as also is species 
external is both exient and deficient and so is complement 

 these are exercises in the meanings of the terms and 
should be thought of until their truth is familiar as also the 
following 

the genus has the utmost partience and may have the utmost 
coinadequacy the species has the utmost coinadequacy and may 
have the utmost partience the external has the utmost deficiency 



 mathematical syllogism 

and may have the utmost exience the complement has the utmost 
exience and may have the utmost deficiency 

 these relations have terminal ambiguity founded on the 
notion of contained having two cases filling the whole or filling 
only a part thus 

genus is either species or exient 
species is either genus or deficient 
external is either complement or coinadequate 
complement is either external or partient 

 read the identities in into this language as in 
species is external of contrary contrary of species is complement 
contraries of species and genus are genus and species c 

 the following are the combinations of mathematical 
relation which take place in syllogisms each triad in the first 
list contains a universal and two particular syllogisms the three 
being opponents connected also by the theorem in 
the second list contains the strengthened syllogisms 

 species of species is species 
 genus of exient is exient 
 exient of genus is exient 

 genus of genus is genus 

 species of deficient is deficient 

 deficient of species is deficient 

 external of complement is species 
 external of exient is coinadequate 
 exient of complement is partient 

 complement of external is genus 
 complement of deficient is partient 
 deficient of external is coinadequate 

 species of external is external 
 genus of partient is partient 
 partient of external is exient 

 genus of complement is complement 
 species of coinadequate is coinadequate 

 coinadequate of complement is deficient 

external of genus is external 
external of partient is deficient 
partient of species is partient 




 mathematical syllogism 

 complement of species is complement 
 complement of coinadequate is exient 

 coinadequate of genus is coinadequate 

 note that when and only when one of the combining words is either 
genus or species the other two words are the same and this throughout 
the fundamental or unstrengthened syllogisms what law of thought does 
this represent and except when one of these words so occurs the three 
words of relation are all different 

 genus of species is partient 

 species of genus is coinadequate 

 complement of complement is partient 

 external of external is coinadequate 

 genus of external is exient 

 species of complement is deficient 

 complement of genus is exient 

 external of species is deficient 

 when we give what may be called comparatively 
terminal precision as in we may use the following nomen 
clature 

 a deficient species may be called a subidentical 
 a species and genus is an identical 
o an exient genus may be called a superidentical 

o a coinadequate external may be called a subcontrary 
i an external complement is a contrary 
 a partient complement may be called a supercontrary 

 the complex syllogisms may be read as follows 
o o a subidentical of a subidentical is a subidentical 

 a superidentical of a superidentical is a superidentical 

 a subcontrary of a supercontrary is a subidentical 

o o a supercontrary of a subcontrary is a superidentical 

o o a subidentical of a subcontrary is a subcontrary 

 o a superidentical of a supercontrary is a supercontrary 

o o a subcontrary of a superidentical is a subcontrary 

o o a supercontrary of a subidentical is a supercontrary 

the following modes of connecting the symbols as applied to 
the same two terms may be useful 
 species but not the greatest possible 

 genus but not the least possible 

o external but not the greatest possible 
o complement but not the least possible 



 metaphysical relations 

 i now proceed to the metaphysical relations between 
attribute and attribute 

 the terms of metaphysical relation are picked up without difficulty 
in our common language but those of mathematical relation had in several 
instances to be forged this means that the world at large has more of the 
metaphysical than of the mathematical notion in its usual form of thought 
but though the unconnected words essential dependent repugnant alternative 
are constantly on the tongues of educated people the combinations of these 
relations are not made with any security and when thought of at all enter 
under a cloud of words while the analysis by which precision of speech and 
habit of security might be gained is treated with contempt as being logic 
a whole drawingroom of educated men may be without a single person 
who can expose the falsehood of the assertion that the essential of an 
incompatible must be incompatible a proposition which i have heard 
maintained though not in those words by persons of more than respectable 
acquirements sometimes by actual error sometimes by confusion between 
the essential of an incompatible and that to which an incompatible is 
essential but even of the persons who are not thus taken in very few 
indeed when told that the answer to the essential of an incompatible is 
incompatible is not so much only independent will be puzzled by the 
juxtaposition of incompatibility and independence as viewed in a relation of 
degree in making these remarks it will be remembered that i am not 
speaking of any words of my own nor of any meanings of my own the 
words are common and i take them in their common meanings but it is 
not generally seen that these common words used in their common senses 
are sufficient in conjunction with their contraries to express all the 
relations which occur in a completely quantified system of onymatic 
enunciation 

 when xy let the attribute y be called an essential 
of the attribute x and x a dependent of y in the contrary case 
x y let y be called an inessential of x and x an independent 
of y remember that dependent on does not mean dependent 
wholly on or dependent only on 

 when xy let each attribute be called a repugnant of 
the other when x y let each be an irrepugnant of the other 

 when xy let each attribute be called an alternative 
of the other when x y let each be called an inalternative of the 
other 

 when difference of symbols is desired the square bracket 
may be used instead of the parenthesis thus may denote 
dependent when read forwards and essential when read back 
wards c 

 essential and dependent are converse relations as are 
also inessential and independent of repugnant irrepugnant alter 



 metaphysical syllogism 

native inalternative each is its own converse essential and 
inessential are contrary relations as are dependent and inde 
pendent repugnant and irrepugnant alternative and inalter 
native compare 

 the essential is both irrepugnant and inalternative as 
also is the dependent the repugnant is both independent and 
inessential as also is the alternative compare 

 the essential has the utmost irrepugnance and may 
have the utmost inalternativeness the dependent has the 
utmost inalternativeness and may have the utmost irrepugnance 
the repugnant has the utmost inessential ity and may have the 
utmost independence the alternative has the utmost inde 
pendence and may have the utmost inessentiality compare 
 

 these relations also have terminal ambiguity com 
pare 

essential is either dependent or independent 
dependent is either essential or inessential 
repugnant is either alternative or inalternative 
alternative is either repugnant or irrepugnant 

 read the identities in into this language as in 
dependent is repugnant of contrary contrary of dependent is 
alternative contraries of dependent and essential are essential and 
dependent c 

 the following are the combinations in syllogism ar 
ranged as in 

 dependent of dependent is dependent 
 essential of independent is independent 
 independent of essential is independent 

 essential of essential is essential 

 dependent of inessential is inessential 

 inessential of dependent is inessential 

 repugnant of alternative is dependent 
 repugnant of independent is inalternative 
 independent of alternative is irrepugnant 

 alternative of repugnant is essential 
 alternative of inessential is irrepugnant 
 inessential of repugnant is inalternative 



 metaphysical syllogism 

 dependent of repugnant is repugnant 

 essential of irrepugnant is irrepugnant 

 irrepugnant of repugnant is independent 

 essential of alternative is alternative 

 dependent of inalternative is inalternative 

 inalternative of alternative is inessential 





repugnant of essential is repugnant 
repugnant of irrepugnant is inessential 
irrepugnant of dependent is irrepugnant 

alternative of dependent is alternative 
alternative of inalternative is independent 
inalternative of essential is inalternative 



 note that when and only when one of the combining words is either 
essential or dependent the other two words are the same and this throughout 
the fundamental or unstrengthened syllogisms what law of thought does 
this represent and except when one of these words so occurs the three 
words of relation are all different 

 essential of dependent is irrepugnant 
 dependent of essential is inalternative 
 alternative of alternative is irrepugnant 
 repugnant of repugnant is inalternative 
 essential of repugnant is independent 

 dependent of alternative is inessential 
 alternative of essential is independent 
 repugnant of dependent is inessential 

 i now proceed to form metaphysical terms expressing 
relations of terminal precision compare let an inherent 
be an attribute asserted let an excludent be an attribute denied 
let an accident which is also nonaccident be an attribute affirmed 
of part and denied of the rest thus of man life is an inherent 
vegetation an excludent wisdom an accident and a nonaccident 

 this new formation cannot be overlooked since it is the extension of 
the aristotelian system of predicables genus and species used in the old 
sense and accident to the system in which contrary terms are permitted 
otherwise the relations of terminal ambiguity compounded might serve 
the purpose 

 each of these relations may be either generic or specific 
either is generic when it applies in as large or a larger degree to 
a larger genus specific when it does not so apply to any larger 



 predicables 

genus this being premised the following relations will be found 
correctly stated 

 v t i j i f specific accident 

o inessential dependent is j 

generic nonaccident 

dependent essential is specific inherent 

o independent essential is generic inherent 

o inalternative repugnant is generic excludent 

 repugnant alternative is specific excludent 

 n i f generic accident 

o irrepugnant alternative is 

specific nonaccident 

 the following are examples of each of these terms the 
universe being terrestrial animal 

specific accident generic nonaccident lawyer is in this rela 
tion to man accident and nonaccident because an attribute of 
some men and not of others specific accident because not found 
in the additional extent of any genus larger than man generic 
nonaccident for the same reason 

specific inherent rational is in this relation to man inhe 
rent because an attribute of all specific because no attribute of 
the additional extent in a larger genus 

generic inherent biped is in this relation to man inherent 
because an attribute of all generic because an attribute of the 
additional extent of a larger genus 

generic excludent oviparous is in this relation to man ex 
cludent because an attribute to be denied of man generic because 
to be also denied of the additional extent of some larger genera 

specific excludent dumb wanting articulate language with 
meaning is in this relation to man excludent because to be 
denied of man specific because not to be denied of the additional 
extent of any larger genus 

generic accident specific nonaccident naked not artificially 
clothed is in this relation to man accident and nonaccident 
because some are and some are not generic accident because an 
accident of the additional extent of larger genera specific non 
accident because not nonaccident of any such additional extent 

 when either of the relations belongs equally to a term 
and its contrary it may be called universal thus an attribute of 
both term and contrary is a universal inherent an accident and 
nonaccident of both term and contrary is a universal accident and 
nonaccident an excludent of both term and contrary is a uni 
versal excludent but the first and third of these terms are chiefly 



 



extent and intent 



of use in defining the universe the second is that relation which 
we suppose until some contradiction is affirmed 

 with the arithmetical reading in extension may be joined 
that in intension in extension the unit of enume 
ration is one of the objects all of which aggregate into the class 
in intension the unit of enumeration is one of the qualities all of 
which compose the object the following is the system of arith 
metical reading in intension naturally connected with 
the metaphysical mode of viewing objects of thought the 
inversion of the quantities presently further described will be 
easily seen namely that x and x now indicate that x is taken 
completely in all its qualities while x and x indicate that x 
is taken incompletely in some some or all not known which 
of its qualities the term any is here introduced when 
grammatically desirable 

arithmetical reading in intension 
all qualities of y are some qualities of x 
some qualities of y not any qualities of x 

all things want either some qualities of x 
or some qualities of y 

some things want neither any quality of x 
nor any quality of y 

all things have either all the qualities of x 
or all the qualities of y 

some things want either some of the quali 
ties of x or some of the qualities of y 

some qualities of y are all the qualities 

of x 
any qualities of y are not some qualities 

of x

 i now proceed to further consideration of the subject of 
quantity no new results can appear but it will be necessary 
both to adapt the old results to the more subjective view of logical 
process and also to consider the distinctions of quantity from 
new points of view 

 the distinction of the two tensions extension and inten 
sion or for brevity extent and intent may for clearness 
 be applied only to classes and attributes the extent 
of a class embraces all the classes of which it is aggregated the 
intent of an attribute embraces all the attributes of which it is 
compounded 

 a class may be subdivided down to the distinct and non 



 quantity of extent and intent 

interfering individual objects of thought of which it is composed 
and here subdivision must stop but it is not for human reason 
to say what are the simple attributes into which an attribute may 
be decomposed the decomposition of the notion rational for 
example into distinct and noninterfering component notions is 
the subject of an old controversy which will perhaps never be 
settled but this difficulty is of no logical importance 

 the relation of quantity as exhibited in the arithmetical 
view of the proposition giving the distinction of univer 
sal and particular quantity as it is commonly expressed or of 
total and partial quantity as i have expressed it may be in this 
part of the subject most conveniently attached to other names 
let the terms full extent and vague extent be used to replace 
total extension and partial extension and let full intent and vague 
intent replace total intension and partial intension 

 these terms are convenient from their brevity full extent is shorter 
than universal extension but they are still more useful as avoiding the 
ambiguity of the words some particular partial which as we have seen 
 note f misleads even the highest writers the logical opposition 
of quantity is not quantity universal and quantity not universal but quantity 
asserted to be universal and quantity not asserted to be universal two words 
cannot be found which express the opposition of undertaking to assert and 
not undertaking to assert universality we may therefore be content with 
full and vague which if they do not express opposition at least do not like 
universal and particular express the wrong opposition 

 additional extent can only be gained by a new aggregate 
containing extent which is not in the collective extent of the 
others additional intent only by a new component which is not 
in the joint intent of the others thus the extent of the class 
animal is not augmented by the aggregation of the class having 
volition if the universe be the visible earth again the intent 
of the notion plane triangle is not augmented by the junction of 
the notion capable of inscription in a circle the distinction 
between these real and apparent augmentations is of the matter 
not of the form and is of no logical import except this that 
when we say that a new aggregant increases extent and a new 
component increases intent we must be prepared with the 
mathematicians to reckon among the cases of quantity 

 there is a remarkable difference between extent and intent which 
though logically nothing at all is psychologically very striking say we 
discover extent hitherto unknown without the necessity of reducing intent 
to include it within a class thought of columbus did this when he first 
was able to add the class american to the classes then known under man 



 opposition of extent and intent 

here is nothing beyond what was possible in previous thought which could 
people the seas to any extent but when we add intent without diminishing 
extent which knowledge is doing every day we cannot conceive beforehand 
what kind of additions we shall make a beginner in geometry gradually 
adds to the intent of triangle which at first is only rectilinear threesided 
figure the components can be circumscribed by a circle has bisectors of 
sides meeting in a point has sum of angles equal to two right angles 
and other properties by the score the distinction is that class aggregation 
joins similars but that composition of attributes joins things perfectly 
distinct of which no one can predicate anything merely by what he knows 
of another thing when the old logicians threw the notion of intent out 
of logic into metaphysics they were guided by the material differences of 
qualities and did not apprehend their similarity of properties a qualities 

 the distinction of extent and intent has found its way 
into common language in the words scope and force which i 
shall sometimes use thus in every man is animal the term 
man is used in all its scope but not in all its force a person 
incognisant of some of the components of the notion man that is 
of the whole force of the term might have the means of knowing 
this proposition but animal is used in all its force and not in 
all its scope this answers to saying that in every x is y 
the term x is of full extent and vague intent the term y is of 
full intent and vague extent 

 the logicians until our own day have considered the extent of a term 
as the only object of logic under the name of the logical whole the intent 
was called by them the metaphysical whole and was excluded from logic 
in our own time the english logical writers and sir william hamilton 
among the foremost have contended for the introduction of the distinction 
into logic under the names of extension and comprehension hamilton uses 
breadth and depth now i say that in the perception of the distinction 
between scope and force as well as in other things the world which always 
runs after quack preparations has ventured for itself out of the logical 
pharmacopoeia this certainly in a rude and imperfect way and without 
apprehension of any theorems i have not found though i have looked for 
it any such amount of recognition that the greater the scope the less the 
force as i could present without suspicion of the aut inveniam out faciam 
bias but i think it likely enough that some of my readers may casually 
pick up passages which show a feeling of this theorem 

 the quantity considered in the arithmetical view of logic 
 was entirely quantity of extent i now proceed to the 
comparison of extent and intent 

 in every use of a term one of the tensions is full and 
the other vague the full extent and the full intent cannot be 
used at one and the same time and the same of the vague extent 
and the vague intent thus x and x must stand for x used 



 opposition of extent and intent 

in full extent and vague intent and x and x for vague extent 
and full intent 

the proof of this proposition is as follows when a term is 
full in extent we can abandon or dismiss any aggregant of that 
extent we please the proposition though reduced or crippled by 
the dismissal is true of what is left but we may not annex an 
aggregant at pleasure when a term is vague in extent we 
cannot dismiss any aggregant whatever for we know not by 
what aggregant the proposition is made true but we may annex 
any aggregant at pleasure for we do not thereby throw out what 
makes the proposition true even if we annex no additional truth 
and we do not when speaking vaguely affirm or deny of any one 
selected aggregant and as the extent must be full or vague 
and we must be either competent or incompetent to dismiss an 
aggregant taken at pleasure and must be either competent or 
incompetent to annex one the converses follow namely 
that when we are competent to dismiss the extent is full and 
when we are incompetent the extent is vague and also that when 
we are competent to annex the extent is vague and when not 
the extent is full precisely the same proposition may be 
established upon the intent of a term and its components 

now let a term be of full extent in diminishing the extent 
which we may do we can so do it as to augment the intent and 
if we be competent to augment the intent that intent must be 
vague as just proved similarly if a term be of vague extent we 
are competent to annex an aggregant that is to diminish the 
intent whence the intent must be full and the same may be 
proved in like manner when either kind of intent is first supposed 
instead of extent though by use of this case may be seen 
to be contained in that already treated and the learner may 
gather the whole from instances thus a bpq gives apq 
andap but not abcpq nor abpqr but pqab 
does not give pa b nor pqa though it does give pqrab 
and pqabc and so on and further from this 
proposition can be made good of all universals when it is known 
of one and the same of all particulars 

 the logicians who have recently introduced the distinction of extension 
and comprehension have altogether missed this opposition of the quantities 
and have imagined that the quantities remain the same thus according to 
sir w hamilton all x is some y is a proposition of comprehension but 
 some y is all x is a proposition of extension in this the logicians have 
abandoned both aristotle and the laws of thought from which he drew the 



 dismissal and transposition of elements 

few clear words of his dictum the genus is said to be part of the species 
but in another point of view jai the species is part of the genus all 
animal is in man notion in notion all man is in animal class in class in 
the first all the notion animal part of the notion man in the second all 
the class man part of the class animal here is the opposition of the 
quantities 

 it appears then that the elements of a tension aggregants 
of an extent components of an intent may be dismissed from the 
term used fully but cannot be introduced may be introduced 
into a term used vaguely but cannot be dismissed the dis 
missible is inadmissible the indismissible is admissible 

 elements of either tension may under the limitations of 
a rule to be shown be transposed from one term of a proposition 
to the other either directly or by contraversion without either loss 
or gain of import to the proposition thus aby is the same 
proposition as aby and xab is the same as xab the 
demonstration of this may best be seen by observing that every 
universal is a declaration of incompossibility and every particular 
a corresponding declaration of compossibility thus xy is an 
assertion that x and y as names of one object are incompossible 
and x y that they are compossible again xy declares x 
and y to be incompossible and so on 

now it will be seen that aby is merely a statement that 
the three names a b y are incompossible and so is aby 
hence aby and aby are identical similarly ab y and 
aby are identical both declaring the compossibility of ab y 
or thus if two propositions be identical their contraries must be 
identical hence we learn that in ya b we have yba c 
carrying this through all transformations we arrive at the 
following rules 

 in universal propositions vague elements the elements of 
terms of either vague tension are transposible directly in nega 
tives by contraversion in affirmatives but full elements are 
intransposible 

 in particular propositions full elements the elements of 
terms of either full tension are transposible directly in affirm 
atives by contraversion in negatives but vague elements are 
intransposible 

thus in xy y is of vague extent if it be a b its 
aggregant a is transposible the proposition being affirmative by 
contraversion that is xa b is identical with xab the 
rules are for comparison and generalisation not for use nothing 



 dismissal and transposition of elements 

can be more evident than that if every x be either a or b every 
x which is not a is b 

 these good words are sir william hamiltons see note t to 
whom in matters of language i am under what he would have called 
obligations general and obligations special his occasional writing of the 
adjective after the substantive is a useful revival of an old practice tending 
much to clearness as to my obligations special he finding the word 
parenthesis not enough to erect his readers hair described my notation as 
horrent with mysterious spiculae this was the very word i wanted 
 for parenthesis has come to mean not the punctuating sign but the 
matter which it includes and parenthetic notation would have been 
ambiguous 

 it has in effect been noticed that for every full term in a 
proposition a term of as much or less tension may be substituted 
and for every vague term a term of as much or more tension 
this is the whole principle of onymatic syllogism or rather may 
be made so for the varieties of principle upon which all onymatic 
inference may be systematically introduced are numerous thus 
in xyz giving xz all we do is to substitute for y used 
vaguely in extent the as extensive or more extensive term z or 
thus for y of full intent we substitute the as intensive or less 
intensive term z for yz or yz shows that z if anything is 
of greater extent and less intent than y 

 there are processes which appear like transpositions but 
are not so in reality thus xpq certainly gives xpq here 
is a universal proposition in which the element of a full tension is 
transposible but not transposible within the description in 
in which it is affirmed that the proposition after transposition is 
identical with the proposition before transposition this is not 
the case here for though xpq gives xpq yet xpq 
does not give xpq here since xpq gives xq and 
xp the term xp is really x and further since xpq 
gives xq from whence xrq be r what it may so long 
as xr has existence the deduction of xpq from xpq is 
a case of something different from mere transposition for p 
in xpq may be changed into anything else 

 the dismissal of the elements of terms comes under 
what may be called the decomposition of propositions when the 
elements of both terms are of the full tension the proposition is a 
compound of m x n propositions if m and n be the numbers of 
elements in the two terms thus a bcd gives and is given 
by the four propositions ac ad bc bd 



 yague quantity in conclusion 

 species external deficient coinadequate 
dependent repugnant inessential inalternative 

must carry the notion of full extent and vague intent for 
example the universe being england farmer is a deficient of 
landowner of all the class farmer no part is identical with a 
certain part of the class landowner to know this by extent i 
must know the whole class farmer but to know it by intent i 
need not know all the attributes of the notion farmer let there 
be but one of these attributes which is not an essential of land 
owner and the proposition is established 

genus complement exient partient 
essential alternative independent irrepugnant 

must carry the notion of vague extent and full intent the 
symbols will here help the memory of those who have fully 
connected them with the words 

 the student must in any one proposition be on his guard against 
thinking inconsistently of class and of attribute either of these modes of 
thought may be chosen but not both together unless the attribute be 
made to distinguish the class without exceptions for a remarkable 
instance take the word gentleman what different things people usually 
mean according as they are speaking by notion of class or of attribute the 
common attribute excludes a percentage of the class and admits many who 
are not of the class the reader may be puzzled to make out the text 
unless his character of landowner correspond to his class 

 the rules of must be translated as follows 
a vague term in the conclusion takes extent or intent scope or 
force as follows 

 in universal syllogisms if one term of conclusion be of 
vague scope or force it has the scope or force of the other if 
both one has the scope or force of the whole middle term the 
other of its whole contrary 

 in fundamental particular syllogisms the vague term or 
terms of the conclusion take scope or force from the vague 
premise 

 in strengthened particular syllogisms the vague term or 
terms of conclusion take scope or force from the whole middle 
term or from its whole contrary according to which is of full 
scope or force in both premises 

 for example actual farming depends on occupation 
of land see the caution in often wanted in reference to this 

i 



 hypothetical syllogism etc 

very instance and occupation of land is an essential of county 
respectability therefore farming and such respectability are in 
alternative here the terms of conclusion are both of vague 
intent or force and the middle term of full intent the force is 
precisely so much as is contained in the notion of occupying land 
any component either of actual farming or of county respect 
ability which can be possessed by a nonoccupier of land is of no 
import in the conclusion as from the above premises 

take the mathematical form of the above farmers are a 
species of occupiers of land the county respectables are a species 
of occupiers whence the farmer is a coinadequate of the county 
respectable or both together do not make up the whole universe 
that is as implied the population of the county here the con 
trary of the middle term the class of nonoccupiers of land forms 
the extent of coinadequacy of the terms of conclusion implied in 
the premises 

 the admission of complex terms and of copular relations 
more general than the word of identification is enable us to 
include in common syllogism all the cases known as hypothetical 
syllogisms conditional syllogisms disjunctive syllogisms dilem 
mas c i shall merely take a few cases of these 

if p be true q is true but p is true therefore q is 
true this is an hypothetical syllogism so called to reduce it 
to a common syllogism between q true and a middle term 
we have q is l a proposition true when p is true a propo 
sition true when p is true is true because p is true there 
fore q is true many other ways might be given in truth 
though the reduction is possible the law of thought connecting 
hypothesis with necessary consequence is of a character which 
may claim to stand before syllogism and to be employed in it 
rather than the converse but the discussion of this subject is 
not for a syllabus see in a similar way may be treated 
 if p be true q is true q is not true therefore p is not true 

 say that p is either a or b or c a is not x b is not 
x c is not x then p is not x this is the syllogism 

t pabcx giving px 
a common syllogism with the middle term an aggregate 

 either p is true or q if p be true x is true if q 
be true y is true therefore either x or y is true the truth 
is the alternative of the truth of p or q which is the alternative 



 belief probability 

of the truth of x or y therefore the truth is the truth of the 
alternative of x or y 

various other instances will be found in my formal logic 
pp 

 in all syllogisms the existence of the middle term is a 
datum if the conclusion be false the syllogism being logically 
valid and the premises true if the terms exist then the non 
existence of one of the terms is the error and if the terms 
which remain in the conclusion be existent the nonexistence of 
the middle term may be inferred when the syllogism is sub 
jective in character the transition into the objective syllogism 
frequently hinges on this point suppose success in a certain 
undertaking such success being conceivable depends both upon 
x and upon z then x and z are not subjectively repugnant 
suppose that in objective reality they are repugnant their 
coexistence being a thing wholly unknown and incredible it 
follows then that success is objectively unattainable impossible 
as things are people say the metaphysical premises xyz 
x y z being conceivable give x z and if x and z have 
objective existence and xz it follows that y does not exist 
for if it did the premises xyz would give xz suppose 
a qualification which depends both upon natural talent and early 
training and suppose the talent to be one which cannot be 
developed early as things go then as things go the qualification 
is unattainable 

 the remaining logical whole of which we have to con 
sider the parts is belief this feeling is one the magnitude of 
which ranges between two extremes certainty for such as we 
have as to the proposition two and two make four and cer 
tainty against such as we have as to the proposition two and 
two make five the first has the whole belief or no unbelief the 
second has no belief and the whole unbelief these extremes are 
represented by and on the scale of belief and would be 
represented by and if we chose which is not necessary to 
have a scale of unbelief 

 that which may be or may not be claims a portion of 
belief and a portion of unbelief that is we partly believe in the 
 may and partly in the may not thus if an iirn contain 
white balls and black balls and nothing else and i am going to 
draw a ball without knowing which and without more belief in 



 testimony and argument 

one ball than in another then my belief in the drawing of white 
is to my belief in the drawing of black as to that is re 
presenting certainty i have of belief in a white ball and in 
a black ball this is usually expressed by saying that the odds 
in favour of a white ball are to and the chances or proba 
bilities of the drawing of white or black ball are and i 
shall call the ratio of belief in a white ball or of unbelief in 
a black ball and the ratio of belief in a black ball or of 
unbelief in a white ball and and the favourable and unfa 
vourable terms for the white ball 

 here as in all other things there are portions which are too small to 
be of perceptible effect csesar may not have died in the manner stated he 
mat if there were such a person which may not be true have been captured 
by the britons and detained in captivity for the rest of his life but the 
received history absorbs so much of our belief that we have but a mere atom 
to divide among all the different ways in which that story may be wrong 
there are two opposite fallacious methods of thinking first the confusion 
of high moral certainty with absolute knowledge in right of the nearness of 
the quantities of belief in the two secondly the confusion of high moral 
certainty with matters of practical uncertainty in right of the want of 
absolute knowledge in both 

 referring to my formal logic for full explanation on 
the subject i shall here only digest a few rules relative to the 
measures of belief and unbelief in questions especially relating to 
logic 

 any alteration of our minds with respect to belief or 
unbelief of a proposition is derived from two sources 

 testimony assertion for or against by those of whose know 
ledge we have some opinion this when absolutely unimpeachable 
is authority though this word is used loosely for testimony of 
high value testimony speaks to the thing asserted to its truth 
or falsehood it turns out good if the proposition be true and bad 
if the proposition be false 

 argument reasoning for or against addressed to the mind 
on its own fprce this when absolutely unimpeachable is de 
monstration though this word is used loosely for reasoning of 
great force reasoning speaks not simply to the truth or false 
hood but to the truth as proved in one particular way if an 
argument be invalid it does not follow that the proposition is 
false but only that it cannot be established in that one way 

 when the proposer of an argument believes in its con 



 testimony and argument 

elusion he is one of the testimonies in favour of the conclusion 
independently of his argument 

 among the testimonies to a conclusion must be counted 
the receiver himself whose initial state of mind enters as the 
testimony of a witness into the mathematical formulas though a 
thing of a very different kind suppose that all circumstances 
duly considered so far as he is able the receiver begins with an 
impression that the proposition in hand has to against it or 
 is his ratio of belief at the outset upon this belief the 
future testimonies and arguments are to act and the mathe 
matical effect is the same as if the first witness bore testimony 
 against the proposition 

 this is the point on which the mathematical study of this theory 
throws most light simple as the thing may appear there is not one writer 
in a thousand who seems to know that the legitimate result of argument and 
testimony depends upon the initial state of the receivers mind they 
request him to begin without any bias to make himself something which 
he is not by an act of his own will judges request juries to dismiss all 
that they know about the case beforehand and this when the juries know 
and the judges know that they know it that the mere fact of the prisoners 
appearance at the bar is itself three or four to one in favour of his guilt 
now the jury do not dismiss this presumption because they cannot and 
they need not because the sound remedy against the presumption lurks in 
their own minds and is ready to act it would not be advisable to discuss 
in a short note the method in which common honesty manages to hit the 
truth in spite of prepossession but i may state my conviction that if the 
juryman were consciously to aim at being somebody else that is a person 
without any preconceived notion he would give a wrong verdict far more 
often than he does i should recommend him not to think about himself at 
all but to forget himself altogether or at least not to be active in bringing 
himself before himself and to listen to the evidence and further to 
remember that the inquiry does not terminate in the jurybox that the 
trial of the evidence commences when the jury retire that the evidence of 
eleven other men to the character of the evidence is itself part of the 
evidence and that the demand for unanimity on the part of the jury is the 
expression of the determination of the law that the juryman shall be forced 
if needful to take other opinions into account i trust this necessity for 
unanimity will never be done away with 

 in assigning numerical value to degrees of belief we are 
supposing cases which are nearly as unusual in human affairs as 
numerically definite propositions but by the study of 
accurate data supposed attainable we analyse the sources of error 
to which our minds are subject in the rough processes which our 
state of knowledge obliges us to use 



 calculation of testimony 

 the method of compounding testimonies is by multiply 
ing together all the favourable numbers for a favourable number 
and all the unfavourable numbers for an unfavourable number 
for instance a person thinks it to against an assertion 
two witnesses affirm it for whose accuracy it is in his mind 
 to and to two witnesses deny it for whose accuracy it 
is in his mind to and to what ought to be his state of 
belief after the testimony 

the several ratios for the assertion are 

 

and xxxx x x x x or is the 
ratio of belief as it should be after the whole testimony is taken 
into account or to against the assertion 

 when several arguments are advanced on one side of a 
question of which the several chances of validity are given the 
chance that the side taken is proved that is that one or more of 
the arguments are valid is as follows take the product of the 
unfavourable numbers for the unfavourable number and subtract 
it from the product of the several totals for the favourable number 
thus if three arguments be advanced on one side the ratios of 
belief in which are the unfavourable num 
ber is xx which subtracted from the product of 
 gives the favourable number hence 
or is the chance of the side being established by one or 
more of the arguments 

 every argument however weak lends some force to its 
conclusion for it may be valid and if invalid does not disprove 
the conclusion but it must be remembered that this conclusion 
is modified by the argument on the other side which arises from 
the production of weak arguments or none but weak arguments 
weak arguments from a strong person themselves furnish an 
argument if an assertion be true it is next to certain that very 
strong arguments exist for it if such arguments exist it is highly 
probable that such and such a person could find them but he 
cannot find them whence there is strong presumption that the 
arguments do not exist and from thence that the assertion is not 
true this kind of reasoning really prevails and leads to a 
rational conclusion that the production of none but weak argu 
ments is a strong presumption against the truth of their con 
clusion but when weak arguments are mixed with strong ones 




 calculatic a 



they may rather tend to reinforce the conclusion though the 
general impression is that they only weaken their stronger 
companions 

 if ever an argument be of such nature that according as 
it is valid or invalid the conclusion is true or false that argument 
is of the nature of a testimony and must be combined with the 
rest as in 

 when testimony and arguments on both sides are to be 
combined the result is obtained as follows combine all the 
testimony into one result as in all the arguments for as in 
 and all the arguments against in the same way then 
form the favourable and unfavourable numbers in the ratio of 
belief required as follows 

favourable number unfavourable number 

multiply together multiply together 

the favourable number of the testi the unfavourable number of the 

mony testimony 

the unfavourable number of the the unfavourable number of the 

argument against argument for 

the total of the argument for i the total of the argument against 

for instance testimony giving argument for and 
argument against the ratio of belief for the truth of the 
assertion should be x x x x or that is it 
is against the assertion being true 

 when testimony is evenly balanced it may be 
altogether omitted when the arguments for and against are 
evenly balanced the arguments may be omitted when the 
arguments on both sides are very strong even though not evenly 
balanced the mind may be presumed unable to compare the two 
very small quantities which they want of certain validity and the 
arguments may be treated as evenly balanced 

 when no argument is offered for let represent 
the ratio of belief which is to be used in the above rule and the 
same when no argument is offered against 

 when testimony is evenly balanced and argument 
for is m n there being no argument against we have 
 x x m n x n x or m n n for the truth of the 
assertion thus on a matter on which our minds have no bias 
an argument which has only an even chance of validity gives 
 to for the truth of the conclusion 



 testimony and argument 

 any one may wisely try a few cases setting down in 
each to the best of his judgment or rather feeling his ratios of 
belief as to testimony argument for argument against and final 
conclusion if the last do not agree with the calculation made 
from the first three he does not agree with himself this he 
may very easily fail to do for in such matters of appreciation one 
element may have more than justice done to it at the expense of 
the rest on the principle laid down in the gospel of st matthew 
xxv 

 the distinction of aggregation and composition occurs in 
the two leading rules of application of the theory of probabilities 
when events are mutually exclusive that is when only one of 
them can happen the chance that one or other shall happen is 
found from the separate chances of happening by a rule of 
aggregation namely by addition but when events are entirely 
independent so that any two or more of them may happen 
together the chance of all happening is found by applying to 
the separate chances a rule of composition namely multiplication 
the connexion of the formulae of probability with those of logic in 
general has been most strikingly illustrated by professor boole in 
his mathematical analysis of logic cambridge vo and 
subsequently in his investigation of the laws of tliought london 
 vo in these works the author has made it manifest that 
the symbolic language of algebra framed wholly on notions of 
number and quantity is adequate by what is certainly not an 
accident to the representation of all the laws of thought
