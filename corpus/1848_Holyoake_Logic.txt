thk logic of the schools howeyer indispeniable in kt 
place fails to meet half the common want in daily life the 
logic of the schools begins with the management of the pre 
mises of an argument there is however a more practical 
lesson to be learned in beginning with the premises them 
•eltcs a thousand errors arise uirough the assumption of 
premises for one arising in the misplacement of terms the 
logic of the schools is an elaborate attack upon the lesser 
evil 

sir james mackintosh has remarked that popular reason 
can alone correct popular sophistry — and it is in vain that 
we expect amendment in the reasoning of the multitude 
unless we make reasoning intelligible to the multitude as 
to my object could i like gridironcobbett adopt a symbol 
of it would have engraved sops old man and his ass 
who in a vain attempt to please everybody failed like his 
disciples — for even he has disciples to please anybody the 
folly of that superfluously philanthropic old gentleman 
should teach us proportion of purpose to be of real service 
to some is in the compass of individual capacity and conse 
quently the true way of serving if not of pleasing au the 
republic of literature like society has its aristocratic its 
middle and its lower classes no one has combined in one 
performance the refinement applauded in the universities 
with the practical purpose popular among those who toil to 
live and live to toil the populace are my choice— of them 
i am one and like a recent premier erl grey am disposed 
to stand by my order i write for this class both from

affection and taste if i can benefit any i can them i 
know their difficulties for i have encountered them— their 
wants for they have been mine this will account for 
the liberties taken with the subjects upon which i treat 
there is more than one kind of hunger that will break 
through barriers and i have taken with an unlicensed hand 
wherever it was to be found what i wanted for myself and 
what i know to be wanted by those who stand at the anvil 
and the loom and who never had the benefits of scholastic 
education and who never will 

many of the arts and sciences which formerly resided ex 
clusively in the eoueges and ministered only to the sons of 
opulence and leisure have escaped from their retreat and 
have become the handmaids of the populace but as re 
spects logic there still remains between the learned and the 
illiterate an itnpassable gulf the uninformed look on the 
recondite structure of logic and they are repelled by the 
difficulty of comprehending it and wrap themselves up in 
absolute and obstinate ignorance which they believe to be 
their destiny the populace in ou manufactories have to 
ehoose between subsistence and intelligence for study afler 
protracted toil they have not the strength — and to abridge 
their labour is to abridge their subsistenre and this they 
eannot afford but because they are precluded by the des 
tiny of civilisation from knowing much they need not remain 
utterly unskilled in reasoning their natural good sense 
may be systematised their natural logic may be reduced to 
some rule and ordertthough it may not be refined it may 
be practical it may give power and develop capacity now 
dormant 

the hints general rules and elementary remarks dispersed 
throughout this work will probably be of selrice to the un 
initiated perhaps put them on the road to higher acquirements 
give them a confidence in their own powers perhaps inspire 
them with a love of these essential studies and impart a 
taste for the refinements which lie beyond my hope is 
that many will be induced to consult scholastic treatises 
and acquire that accurate knowledge which makes the 
society of ecated people so interesting impfulse has 
been given to knowledge and the populade have begun to 
think and both to speak and write their thinkings — and why 
should thejf not be enabled to do it free from obvious mis

no instalment of liberty but insist on the concession of all 
their claims — but the scholar does the same thing when he 
will impart none but the completest information to the 
people 

in quoting i have been a borrower but not a plagiarist 
in no case am i conscious of having taken from others with 
out at the same time making the fairest acknowledgment in 
my power 

if the references to the highest authorities are sometimes 
through others it is because the highest authorities have not 
always been accessible those who have had ordinary ex 
perience estimate highly the value of minute integrity in this 
respect fruitless hours are spent in tracing false and care 
less references and to one whose time is his means no little 
injury is done when it is thus wasted 

unbounded gratitude is due to those authors old and new 
who with learning and grace with care and patience have 
put the world in possession of thoughts which are real addi 
tions to its knowledge— and corresponding should be the con 
tempt of those whose highsounding and pretending books 
seduce readers to wade through them only to find in them 
the millioneth echo of some commonplace idea 

the spectator was pleased to say that i wrote practi 
cal grammar in the spirit of an ultra radical setting the 
world to rights yet i have always declared with butler — 

reforming schemes are none of mine 
to mend the worlds a vast design j 
like those who toil in little boat 
to drag to them the ship afloat 

utopianism is not my idiosyncracy but i have confidence in 
endeavour continuity of ameliorative efiort is the sole en 
thusiasm that can serve the cause of improvement it is 
useful to do what seems to be useful whether little or much 
— a moderate rule but one that will take those who carry it 
out a long way 

my illustrations i need scarcely say are neutral in politics 
and theology in the grammar of j a d dorsey pub 
lished in chambers educational course there are disputa 
tions biblicisms and bits of intense theology professor 
john radford yeung in his treatise on algebra has intro 
duced a reply to humes controverted theory of miracles —

and dr whately makes his logic an ayowedly theological 
auxiliary showing that much passes for good taste in thia 
country which is only an irrelevant propitiation of powerful 
opinion i have not however been seduced by this species 
of example there are distinct provinces in intellect as 
well as in industry — and what political economy justifies in 
one case good sense dictates in the other no man has a 
right to intrude theology into every question and agitate 
points of faith when he pretends to instruct the under 
atanding 

there is less occasion to speak of the utility of logic than 
to show it to be easy of acquisition mr stuart mill in 
confirmation of this view observes we need not seek far 
for a solution of the question so often agitated respecting 
the utility of logic if a science of logic exists or is 
capable of existing it must be useful if there be rules to 
which every mind conforms in every instance in which it 
judges rightly there seems little necessity for discussing 
whether a person is more likely to observe those rules when 
he knows the rules than when he isunacquainted with them 
certainly people are not so much prejudiced against logic 
on account of its supposed uselessness as on account of its 
supposed difficulties deserved or net logic has always had 
a good reputation well or ill founded the popular 
impression has uniformly been in its fiiyour it has been 
valued like the diamond — but considered like that precious 
stone of very uncertain access 

the high popularity of common sense — the exercise of 
the judgment unaided by rulehas been interpreted into a 
virtual rejection of logic by the multitude but it ought 
not to be overlooked that the credit in which mere common 
sense is held is a matter of necessity aa well as choice it 
being the best sense the untutored have they wisely use it 
and no wonder that they are inclined to laud what they are 
constrained to employ doubtless they always perceived 
that common sense would be the better for being made 
orderly as a spirited horse is the fitter for use after being 
broken logical sense among the masses is secretly 
supposed to be disciplined sense and to have all the advan 
tage of the trained soldier over the raw recruit 

it is quite true as abram tucker puts it that the science

of abstruse learning when completely attained is like 
achilles spear that healed the wounds it had made before 
so this knowledge serves to repair the damage itself had 
occasioned it casts no additional light upon the paths of life 
but few persons sensible of the value of exact knowledge will 
complain of the necessary elaboration to which it sometimes 
leads nor will those who have felt the thrill of pleasure 
which complete analysis imparts regret the patience which 
put them in possession of a secret of science or made them 
master of a new field of knowledge 

common sense is the substratum of all logic common 
sense is the natural sense of mankind it is founded on 
common observation and experience it is modest and 
plain and unsophisticated it sees with everybodys eyes 
and hears with everybodys ears it has no capricious 
distinctions no partialities and no mysteries it never 
equivocates and never trifles its language is always the 
same and is always intelligible it is known by its per 
spicuity of speech and singleness of purpose the most 
prudent of all the children of fact it never forsakes nature or 
reason some outline laws for its employment if they 
 can be indicated must be better than its popular aimless and 
desultory use

one bas no right to make a literary subject political 
— that is to make it partisan but to give a political 
motive which concerns all equally for promoting a 
literary study is allowable and does not partake of 
the nature of party politics one may like cobbett 
look on literature with political eyes without like 
him making it a vehicle of party attacks 

in this country where the political genius of the 
people lies in selfgovernment — where the public 
growth of the people and their internal liberty depend 
upon their capacity to manage their own affairs — the 
art of public speaking has political importance to eyerj 
side in politics 

to be able to take a subject well in hand like a 
stagecoach driver does his horses — to hold the reins 
of your arguments firmly — to direct and drive well 
home the burden of your meaning is a power which 
every man ought to study to attain who rises to 
address a council or stands up on a platform to 
oonvince a meeting

it is a taumiliating reflection that mankind never reatoned so ill ns when 
fhey most professed to cultivate the art of reasoning— lte of galileo p 
society for the diffusion of useful knowledge 

gmmon sense — the foundation of logic — first received to a 
limited extent the regularity of an art and the certainty of a 
science from the master hand of aristotle impartial scholars 
familiar with his writings on logic allow them to have not only 
ingenuity but real merit and his admirers contend that he has 
heen misunderstood by some and abused by others this is highly 
probable as we are certain that when his works were interpreted 
by the schools and his logic proclaimed the great textbook of 
imowledge and the only weapon of truth mens minds instead 
of studying nature were in an endless ferment about occult 
qualities and imaginary essences little was talked of but inten 
tion and remission proportion and degree infinity formality 
quiddity and individuakty logic then was jargon contro 
versy chicane and truth a shuttiecock with which the dispu 
tants respectively played or the object which they mutually dis 
guised logic was a labyrinth in which the subtlest lost their 
way — a bourne firom which the traveller after truth seldom re 
turned 

a striking illustration of this has been furnished by a candid and 
distinguished writet — dr reid of the analytics and of the to 
pics of aristotle ingenuousness requires me to confess that though 
i have often purposed to read the whole with care and to under 

 account of lord bieont notubi orgton sdentianun lib of usefu

 cooic or tbb schools 

stand whai it inieuigible yet my courage and patience always failed 
me before i had done why should i throw away so mach time 
and painful attention upon a thing of so little real use if i 
had lived in those ages when the knowledge of aristotles or 
ganon entitled a man to the highest rank in philosophy ambition 
might have induced me to employ upon it some yedrs of painful 
study and less i conceive would not be sufficient such re 
flections as these always got the better of my resolution 

dr whately who has for many years occupied the throne of 
logic and whose work maybe taken from its currency in our 
colleges and academies as the representative of the logic of the 
schools seems to obviate all objections to the abstruseness of this 
subject by a counter charge to the effect that logic is now under 
rated only because it has been overrated but it is not the com 
plexity found in it but iie laudations bestowed upon it which 
have brought it into neglect dr whately contends that certain 
writers by representing logic as furnishing the sqic instrument 
for the discovery of truth in all subjects and as teaching the use 
of the intellectual faculties in general raised expectations which 
could not be realised and which naturally led to a reaction— to 
logic being regarded as utterly intile and empty f deeply de 
ploring this kind of injury from which many important arts have 
suffered i am neither disposed to defend sudi a course nor toimi 
tate it but i demur to the truth of this representation with 
regard to logic if logic be not the aviie instrument for the 
discovery of truth in all subjects it is certainly the prmcipal 
one instead of charging scholastic logicians with having un 
duly raised it would be nearer the trutii in my opinion to 
say that they have confused eiqtations by intricate mao 
cmnery and extreme elaborations 

intricacy and minuteness of detail might be a trifling disqijiali 
fication did they lead to something immediately practical but 
dr whately contends that logic in the most extensive sense 
which the name can with propriety be made to bear is that of 
the science and also the art of reasoning inasmuch as logic 
institutes an analysis of the process of the mind in reasoning it 
is strictiy a itjence while considered in reference to the practical

ralei it fnrbkhei it ii an art he confinet the pfoihnee 
of logic as an art to employing language properly for the 
purpose of reasoningf and restricts the logician to the use 
of the syllogism as the sole test of argument mr augustus 
de morgan thus exhibits the spirit of whatelys restriction — 
logic has nothing to do with the truth of the facts opinions or 
presumptions from which an inference is derived but simply 
takes care that the inference shall certainly be true if the pre 
mises be true 

it has been and t to be objected that logic thus confined 
 leaves untouched the greatest diflbculties and those which are 
the sources of the greatest errors in reasoning to this powerful 
objection dr whately thinks it sufficient to reply that no art 
is to be censured for not teaching more than falls within its pro 
vince and indeed more than can be taught by any concdvable 
art such a system of universal knowledge as should instruct us 
in the full meaning or meanings of every term and the truth or 
calaty certainty or uncertainty of every proposition thus super 
seding all other studies it is most nnphuosophical to expeet or 
even to imagine and to find fault with logic for not performing 
this is as if one should object to optics for not giving sight to 
the blind — or complain of a reading glass for being of no service 
to a person who had never learnt to read this would be a 
most conclusive answer if confident assertion could be acceptfd 
in lien of proof the objection still remains to be removed we 
may still demand does it not fall within the legitimate province 
of logic to provide means of encountering the greatest difficul 
ties with which it is confessed logic is beset true there is no 
art can teach everything but is that a reason why logic should 
teach nothing or next to nothing compared with what seems 
essentially necessary f 

dr w lately contends that the difficulties and errors in 
the objection adduced axe in the mtqect matter about which 
logic is employed and not in the process of reasoning — which 
alone is the appropriate province of logic but it seems to mo 
that dr whately has found it impossible to keep within the 
bounds of the restriction he thus endeavours to establish

in treating npon apprehension he introdueee as indeed ha 
was obliged to do from the department of metaphysics several 
speculations on generalisation and abstractions and from 
ontology the science which explains the most general concep 
tions respecting the phenomena of nature he borrows the leading 
principles of definition because he thus goes so far it is not to 
be contended that therefore he should have gone further but 
when he found he must depart from his rule and borrow from 
other branches of knowledge no matter for what end why did 
he not depart from it to some purpose and borrow from natural 
philosophy such rules as would have guarded the logician from 
the chief errors into which he may fall 

dr vvhately informs us indeed that logic furnishes certain 
syllogistic forms to which all sound arguments may be reduced 
and thus establishes universal tests for the detection of fallaoy— 
but it is to be observed that it is only sucfi fallacy as may creep 
in betwebn the premises and the conclusion of an argument it 
is to this narrow and aristotelian object that logic is restricted 
 the process of reasoning itself is alone the appropriate province 
of logic this process will have been correctly conducted if it 
have conformed to the logical rules which preclude the possibility 
of any error creeping in between the principles from which we are 
arguing and the conclusions we deduce from them we learn 
from our authority that as arithmetic does not profess to intro 
duce any notice of the things whether coins persons or di 
mensions respecting which calculations are made neither does 
logic undertake the ascertainment of facts or the degree of 
evidence of doubtful propositions and just as an arithmetical 
result will be useless if the data of the calculation be incorrect so 
a logical conclusion is liable to be false if the premises are so 
neither does the logic now under consideration concern itself 
with the ¦ discovery of truth excepting so far as that may be 
said to be implied by the detection of error in a false infer 
encef logic thu confined to the actual process of reason 
ing however important its functions there evidently leaves 
us in the dark as to the value of what we reason about for 
the information thus missing this logic refers us to knowledge

logic or the schools 

in general to grammat and compontion for the art of ex 
pressing with correctness and perspicnity the terms of propo 
sitions — to natural moral political or other philosophy for 
the facts which alone can establish the truth of the premises 
reasoned from 

the exclusion from logic of all consideration of the facts on 
which propositions are founded is thus endeavoured to be justi 
fied by the archbishop of dublin — no arithmetical skill will 
secure a correct result unless the data are correct from which 
we calculate nor does any one on that account undervalue 
arithmetic and yet the objection against logic rests on no better 
foundation this is trud but is it true that arithmetic is on tku 
account to be imitated if the arithmetician must take his data 
for granted it is what the searcher after truth must never do— 
he must use his eyes and examine for himself in all cases as far 
as possible unless he intends to be deceived and for want of 
such precaution as this the arithmetician is at sea the moment he 
steps out of the narrow path of mechanical routine who is not 
aware of the failures of calculation when applied to the general 
business of life— to statistics moral and political every day 
facts have to be called in to correct the egregious blunders of 
figures the calculations are conducted in most approved form 
but are of no use does not this demonstrate that when arith 
metic like logic is applied to the business of hfe general rules 
for securing the accuracy of data would be of essential service 
supposing however that tirithmetic could do very well thout 
them does it follow that logic should when it would be safer and 
more eflbcient with them 

since our authors canons are held absolute in the schools it 
may be useful to consider this last cited argument in another 
light a stronger objection may be urged one which particularly 
addresses itself to those who mistake mere pertinence for genelral 
relevance and suppose that a single analogy decides a case

his grace reasons that because arithmetic does not oonoerm 
itself about its data logic should follow the same example 
but why otorlooks he pure mathematics — a much higher science 
than arithmetic surely geometry which through all time has 
been the model of the sciences was better worthy than arith 
metic to be the model of logic was it classical in the principal 
of st albans college to abandon euclid and cleave unto gcker 
or walkingame 

arithmetic is meehanical — geometry is reasoning surely it 
was more befitting to compare reason with reason when endea 
vouring to discover the true way of perfecting reason geometry 
is of all sciences reputed the most conclusive in its arguments— 
and we know it is distinguished above all sciences for carefulness 
in its data it begins with axioms the most indubitable of all 
data and its subsequent conclusions are founded onlv on eitab 
ushed facts— and to be sure that they are established facts the 
geometer before he employs them establishes them himself if 
an analogy is to decide the province of logic here is an analogy 
whose pretensions over those of arithmetic are eminent 

so conclusive did dr whately deem the argument just 
examined that he many times in various forms reproduced it 
one of the last instances is under the head of fallacies it 
has been made a subject of bitter complaint against logic that it 
presupposes the most difficult point to be already accomplished 
viz the sense of the terms to be ascertained a similar ob 
jection might be urged against every other art in existence 
tf against agriculture that all the precepts for the culti 
ation of land presuppose the possession of a farm al 
ready has been pointed out what may reasonably induce a 
suspicion of the soundness of these analogies viz that their 
author found it necessary to disregard them and introduce from 
other branches of knowledge certain disquisitions on the 
 sense of terms with regard to this particular instance it 
may be observed that though treatises on agriculture do pre 
suppose the possession of a farm they do not presuppose the 
knowledge requisite for cultivating it but inform visfuuy of soil 
and seed and crops so logic may be allowed to presuppose the 
esustenee of the universe whence truth ii drawn or the ftkistenoe

cf hngnage wliereby it is wptwma but it is snwly not to pre 
uppote the knowledge of facts and tonns the great instraments 
for the cultivation of truth agricultural treatises hardly 
warrant this inforence theis are the repiesentatioas that in 
duced the cenfession thut logic is not so much an instrument of 
acquirement as of defence it is a good armour to buckle on 
when compelled to battle for our heritage but a poor implement 
for its cultivation 

all practieal arts include a knowledge of materials as well as 
implements platers ignorant of the nature of metals cabinet 
makers of the different spedes of wood make but sorry artisans 
and in like manner reasoners unacquainted at least in a general 
way with the accuracy of what is reasoned about make but 
sorry logicians 

it will readily be expected that in the modem progress of 
knowledge the aristolian province of logic would be enlarged 
the farseeing intellect of lord verulam heralded the innova 
tion— our glorious bacon led phflosophy forth from the jargon 
of schools and the fopperies of sects he made her to be— the 
handmaid of nature friendly to ker creatures and faithful to 
her laws x 

the general object of lord bacons philosophy writes bruce an 
edinbtirgh professor of logic of the last century is to connect the 
reasoning powers of man with ezperimente for the improvement of 
natural knowledge 

to create a just taste for phslosophicalinvestigation required— 
 a display of the true that they may be distinguished from the 
false subjects of inquiry scientific rules to direct the dis 
covery of the laws f nature 

but to dispuiy the true is to display the fatu on which 
the truth rests the discovery of the laws of nature implies

it roost obtioiu as fhe reader will gatiher from what has bees 
advanced that for guarding to the greatest possible extent 
against error in condasions it is necessary to take into considera 
tion the character of the data from which we reasonand to do 
this we must draw from the general sources oi knowledge to 
which the logic of the schooils refers ns if we happen not to 
possess an accurate acquaintance with these branches we must 
draw upon the best notions we have of them or apply such natu 
ral sagacity as we happen to possess but whether the informa 
tion we happen to possess be complete or partial it is not well 
that we are left to apply it at random without any definite mode 
of procedure and if loc pefusea to assist us and gives only a 
vague reference dsewhere we must endeavour to assist ourselves 
the datum of all arguments is a proposition an assertion or denial 
and to ascertain its truth upon which the value of the whole 
reasoning depends we have to do with the facts upon which it 
rests and the terms in which it is expressed for it may be here 
observed that the truth or falsity of every proposition depends 
upon facts to ascertain the general accuracy of facts we have 
to appeal to received standards of certainty and to fix the mean 
ing of terms we have recourse to a plain principle o£ definition 
in the task of recognising truth so nejcessaay in examining the 
premises of an argument one is wonderfully asidsted by being 
familiarised with the sources of truth and the mode of its dis 
covery in these operations the tutored and untutored may 
alike be assisted by simple general rules if these rules prove 
not infallible in every case they will prove successful in the ma 
jority of cases 

since general rules are the only rules that the vast field of 
facts admits of they are not to be rejected on light grounds 
they eabto us to set forth intelligibly the reasons of our own 
conviction and to detect and expose the fundamental fallacies o£ 
apparent arguments sinoe they direct us where the logic of the

complex rear of modals hypotheticals conditionals and 
 disjunctives this is certainly not the portal through which 
the populace can at present pass to logic even if such logic helped 
them to all truth and saved them from all fallacy 

bttt this species of logic is not without interest symbolic 
letters and mnemonic lines are not without attractions to 
those who understand them there is poetry in an algebraic 
fign when it is the emblem of a difliculty solved and a wonderful 
result simply arrived at to try the whole power of words and 
discover every form of language in which a legitimate deduction 
can be expressed is no ignoble task it is a high discipline but 
it belongs rather to the age of leisure than this of copperas 
fames cottonfuz ginriot wrath and toil — to the luxuries rather 
than the utilities of learning 

there is the inefficiency of the syllogism and also the vitiation 
produced by its employment it corrupts the taste for phi 
losophical invention by placing philosophy in abstractions and 
nitsdrawing it from the observation of nature 

 it creates a reliance on principles which originate in the 
hypothetet of philosophers not in the laws of nature 

 it makes truth the result of theorimof alrgument not of

there on what facts rest the measurement of the radii bom

to say the logic of the schools prides itself in leaving as where 
the stagyrite left us

they were solicitous to abstract and they formed general pro 
positions from a umiled observation though these propositioiis 
were assumed they were admitted as true they were not 
examined by appeals to nature but by comparison with ether 
propositions 

in this syllogism from aristotle there is thensual eonplianoe 
with accredited rules and the same defiance of common eense 
such examples are deemed perfect reasoning and litimate byg 
ment but is it not a mockery to encourage the belief that we 
can have reason and argument mthout the truth only this 
shallow consolation remains to us if the logician of the schoele 
does not enlighten the understanding he is at least reputed not td

to a quotation in finnocks guide to knowledge locke defined 
logic as that art by which we rightly use our mental faculties in 
the discovery and communication of truth a definition called by 
the writer the definition of nature echoed by genius there 
exists a natural connection between logic and rhetoric the dis 
covery of truth could avail us little if we were without the means 
of oommunicating it and it is easy to see that it would be ii 
vain to possess the means of communicating truth unless we had 
the truth to communicate therefore ingenuity is but ill em 
ployed in separating these mutual departments of learning 
wmch nature has connected together besides the skill of the 
logician if as serviceable in the statement of a case as in arguing 
it arrangement is as much a matter of logic as ratiocination 
and to impress this neglected truth upon the young inquirer is 
one reason for proposing a combined definition

truth in sculpture means an exact similitude of some urlng torm 
ehiselled in stone or marble truth in painting is a natural 
representation on canvass of some person or object in the same 
manner moral truth is an exact image of things set forth in 
speech or writing the logical definition of truth is given in 
these words — truth is that which admits of proof that is an 
ajisertion or denial which can be substantiated by facts 

a fact is connbonly called a truth but this practice leads to 
great confusion in reasoning a fact is only an element in truth 
a logical truth is a proposition supported by facts facts com 
pose the premises of an argument — a truth is the inference from 
the facts unless this distinction is observed recourse must be had 
to the expedient of calling a fact a particular truth and an induc 
tion from facts a general truth or we must adopt this distinc 
tion that a mcral truth that is the truth of parlance is the 
coincidence of language with reality and a logical truth a propo 
sition which admits of demonstration 

a lady who has given intellectual laws to many whom i 
address has said — a truth i consider to be an ascertained fact 
which truth would be changed into an error the moment the fact 
on whiqh it rested was disproved but that which can be dis 
proved cannot be an ascertained fact allowing however the 
relevancy of this definition of ar truth it would in a treatise on 
logic be considered as a definition only of a particular truth 
many such truths are required to make a logical truth

the beginning of all knowledge is observation it has been 
shown by mr mill that axioms which lie at the foundation of 
all reasoning and all science are experimental truths— generali 
sations rom observation the proposition that two straight lines 
cannot inclose a space — or in other words two straight lines 
which have once met do not meet again but continue to diverge 
— is an induction from the evidence of ottr senses axioms are 
but a class of inductions from experience the simplest and easiest 
cases of generalisation from the facts furnished to us by our 
senses or by our internal consciousness 

autobiography or the metaphysical revelation of a man to 
himself is a source of valuable psychological and moral truths 
from this centre frequently radiate new lights upon human nature 
but this is resolvable into a species of mental observation it is 
selfinspection 

we have lately been told that poetry is called upon to work 
in the discovery of truth the imagination has always been 
the great discovering power discoveries are the poetry of sci 
ence the case is rare indeed in which by merely advancing 
step by step in the exercise of the logical faculty any new truth 
has been arrived at logic comes afterwards to verify that 
which imagination sees with its fardarting glanoetl 

this seems to call upon us to recegoise the imagination as 
fresh source of truth but the definition of imagination as given 
ty emerson reveals to us its origin in observation the 
imagination may be defined to be the use which reason makei 
of the material world shaksperes imperial muse tosses the 
creation like a bauble from hand to hand to embody any ca 
pricious shade of thought that is uppermost in his mind hence 
though we agree with gilfillan thattmagination is thought on fire 
we must confess that the ignition is material

as the theories of the schoolmen subside and men no longer

without meaning the knowledge of nature was at a stand men 
argued concerning things f which they had no idea in this 
enlightened age we keep to trial and experiment as the only 
certain foundation of philosophy 

 hypotheds may be noticed here as being a species of embryo 
experiment hypothesis is guessing at the truth it is a conjec 
ture or supposition relating to the cause of an effect it imagines 
that where certain conditions exist the desired result will ensue 
but all these conjectnres must be founded on observation for 
in the wildest conjecture unless made by a madman there is 
some reason hypothesis is incipient truth founded on a few facts 
which make it probable but not on sufficient to make it certain 
hypothesis does not directly discover truth but it is a guide to 
experiment which does the hypotheses of columbus respecting 
an unknown continent did not of itself discover america — but it 
directed the experiment of his voyage there which did to hy 
pothesise alone is the error of the visionary and the dreamer 
practical wisdom as fiir as posnble tests hypothesis by experi 
smnt sir c bell conjectitred that the nervous fluid of the hu 
man body was analogous to galvanic fluid and then by oxperi 
menfcs on various animals he endeavoured to test his hypothesis 
however great thinkers arise who are best employed in contriv 
ing plans for others to execute— in telling others what they are to 
do great poets belong to this class they are often incapable 
of the concentrated labour of furnishing proofs of their hypothe 
lis gladly should we recognise the mission of such men they 
work for humanity by thinking for humanity all who think 
•ays lytton • are cooperative with all who work labour 
supplies our wants thought teaches us dominion over nature 
labour is but the means of subsistence it is thought that makes 
it the source of wealth by multiplying its powers 

to the value of hypothesis mr mill bears this testimony that 
by suggesting observations and experiments it puts us upon 
the road to independent evidence if it be really attainable and 
till it be attained the hypothesis ought not to count for more 
than a suspicion the function of hypothesis is one which must 
be reckoned absolutely indispensable in science without luch

assmnptioii science would xmt have attained its present state 
nearly eveiything which is now theory was once hypothesis 

induction is systematic observation of a given class of 
phenomena it consists in bringing together a variety of 
facts and instances carefully and patiently viewing them in all 
possible lights to discover from a comparison of the whole 
what if any new principle is elicitable induction is an ex 
periment with a number of facts to see if any general result 
can be arrived at thus observation is of three kinds — discur 
sive experimental and inductive for brevity of speech we 
use respectively the terms observation experiment and indue 
tion as the names of the three recognised modes of investigation 
bat it facilitates a clear view of this subject to note that experi 
ment and induction are but phases of observation — and that 
observation is the great source of the discovery of truth 

discursive observation and experiment ar the sources of facts 
or particular truths nature poetically says dr reid is put to 
the question by a thousand observations and experiments and 
forced lo confess her secrets out of these secrets induction ga 
thers its general truths which become the premises of argu 
ment facts like stones are of little service while scattered 
it is in the edifice raised by them that their value is apparent 
they have been compared to blocks upon me of which if a person 
stand he has but a partially increased view but when many 
are piled up a person from their summit commands the prospect 
round particular truth seldom proves anything but itself 
argument is proving something else and we have seen that that 
which is proved must be contained in something which proves it 
in other words an argument is an assertion or denial of some 
thing substantiated by other things— by facts 

gall bbserved the peculiar formation of a certain liead but the 
one fact proved nothing except that the head had a certain form 
it was a barren observation except that it suggested to his ima 
gination the hypothesis that the peculiar form of the head might 
be caused by peculiarity of mind this set him upon the experi 
mt of observing the habits and dispsitidns of the individual in 
lorder to test his hypothesis but the one fact of finding a pecu 
liarity proved nothing new of any value the two facts thougli 
ndlncident were hardly convincing they proved only that a

nliar head was accompaiiied in one case by pecnliar habit— 
but whether one was the eause of the other ot whether the phe 
nomena were in any way connected still remained unknown 
when however gall spurzheim and others had travelled 
through europe making observations and experiments and at last 
putting all the facts and instances together and carefully and 
patiently viewing them in all possible lights and finding that they 
shadowed forth that the brain was the organ the map and mea 
sure of intelligence they inducted a general truth which enters 
the lists of argument and takes its place as an addition to out 
metaphysical and moral treasures 

mr macaulay who perhaps might be aocnsed of underrating 
both bacon and induction with a view of exalting aristotle re 
marks that the vulgar notion about bacon we take to be this that 
he invented a new method of arriving at truth which method is 
called induction and that he detected some fallacy in the syllogis 
tic reasoning which had been in vogue before his time this notion 
is about as well founded as that of the people who in the middle 
ages imagined that virgil was a great conjurer many who are 
far too well informed to talk such extravagant nonsense entertain 
what we think incorrect notions as to what bacon really effected 
in this matter the inductive method has been practised ever 
since the beginning of the world by every human being it is 
constantly practised by the most ignorant clown by the most 
thoughtless schoolboy by the very child t the breast that me 
thod leads the clown to the conclusion that if he sows barley he 
shall not reap wheat by that method the schoolboy learns that 
a cloudy day is the best for catching trout the very infant we 
imagine is led by induction to expect milk from his mother or 
nurse and none from his father not only is it not true that 
bacon invented the inductive method but it is not true that he 
was the first person who correctly analysed that method and ex 
plained its uses aristotle had long before pointed out the absur 
dity of supposing that syllogistic reasoning could ever conduct 
men to the discovery of any new principle had shown that such 
discoveries must be made by induction and by induction alone 
and had given the history of the inductive process concisely in 
deed but with great perspicuity an precision we are not in 
clined to ascribe much practical value to that analysis of the 
inductive method which bacon has given in the second book of

the norum organon it it indeed an elaborate and correct 
analysis but it is an analysis of that which e are all doing 
from morning to night and which we continue to do even in our 
dreamf 

it is not some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning wluch 
bacon is supposed to have detected it is rather the partial protec 
tion against error afforded by syllogisms which he exposed and 
provided against for which he is estimated certainly aristotle 
must have had a very different opinion of the value of inductive 
philosophy from that entertained by bacon or he would have 
indoctrinated his disciples with it few will doubt that had 
baoons novum organon appeared in the place of aristotles 
logic and aristotles work in the place of bacons that the ad 
vancement of learning in the world would now be in a very dif 
ferent state could bacon have arrested the attention of the 
ancient sagei with his nethods of discovering new principles 
ancient philosophy instead of being a treadmill would have been 
a path and we should not have had a contempt for all learning 
which was useful when fosidonius said that we owed to philo 
sophy the principles of the arch and the introduction of metals 
we should not have had seneca repudiating such insulting com 
pliments nor archimedes considering that geometry was degraded 
by being employed in anyuiing useful 

but these observations of macanlay have the merit of showing 
us that induction has its foundation in nature and afford a 
fozther confirmation of our views that observation is te source 
of our knowledge and that it is the province of logic to teach us 
to f yatematise our thoughts observation experiment hypothesis 
and induction are bat different names for the operation — varying 
in degree in method in expedient and elaboration— whereby we 
discover truth nature is the treasurehouse of truth and the 
sole fee of appropriation is attention 

much discussion has taken place upon the nature of necessary 
truths mr mill however after an elaborate analycds of dr 
whewells theory pronounces that nothing is necessary ex 
cept the connection between a conclusion and the premises a 
sacessary truth is commonly defined as a proposition the nega 
ibn of which is not only false but inconceivable mr mill con 
tests this doctrine in words embodying suggeslions of great value

is no more generally acknowledged fact in homan nature than 
the extreme difficulty at first € in conoeiying aaything as po 
sible which is in contradiction to long established and familiar 
experience or eren to old and familiar habits of thought and 
this difficulty is a necessary result of the fundamental laws of the 
human mind when we have often seen and thought of two 
things together and have never in any one instance either seen 
or thought of them separately there is by the primary law of asso 
ciation an increasing difficulty which in the end becomes insu 
perable of conoeiting the two things apart this is most of all 
conspicuous in uneducated persons who are in general uttvly 
unable to separate any two ideas which have once become firmly 
associated in their minds and if persons of cultifated intelleot 
have any advantage on the point it is only because having seen 
and heard and read more and been more accustomed to exerdae 
their imagination they have experienced their sensations and 
thoughts in more varied combinations and have been prevented 
from forming these inseparable associations but this advantage 
has necessarily its limits the man of the most practised intel 
lect is not exempt from the universal laws of our conceptive 
faculty if daily habit presents to him for a long period two facta 
in combination and if he is not led during that period either by 
acddent or intention to think of them apart he will in time be 
come incapable of doing so even by the strongest efltortj and the 
supposition that the two facts can be separated ia nature will at 
last present itself to his mind with all the characters of an ineon 
ceivable phenomenon there are remarkable instances of this ia 
thehistory of science instances in which the wisest men rejected 
as imposable because inconceivable things which their posterity 
by earlier practice and longer perseverance in the attempt found 
it quite easy to conceivei and which everybody knows to be true 
 if then it be so natural to the human mind even in its higl 
est state of culture to be incapable of conceiving and on that 
ground to believe impossible what is afterwasds not only found

to be conceivable bat prored to be tnie wbat wonder if lb cases 
where the association is still older more confirmed and more fa 
miliar and in which nothing erer occurs to shake oar conviction 
or even suggest to us any conception at variance with the associ 
ation the acquired incapacity should continue and be mistaken 
for a natural incapacity it is true our experience of the varieties 
in nature enables us within certain limits to conceive other 
varieties analogous to them we can conceive the sun or moon 
falling for although we never saw them faxt nor ever perhaps 
imagined them falling we have seen so many other things fall that 
we have innumerable familiaif liinalogies to assist the conception 
which after all we should probably have some dtflsculty in fram 
ing were we not well accustomed to see the sun and moon move 
or appear to move so that we are only called upon to conceive 
a slight change in the direction of motion a circumstance fami 
liar to our experience but when experience affords no model on 
which to shape the new conception how is it possible for us to 
form it how for example can we imagine an end to space or 
time we never saw any object without something beyond it 
nor experienced any feeling without something following it 
when therefore we attempt to conceive the last point of space 
we have the idea irresistibly raised of ether points beyond it 
when we try to imagine the last instant of time we cannot help 
conceiving another instant after it nor ib there any necessity 
to assume as is done by a modern school of metaphysicians a 
peculiar fundamental law of the mind to account for the feeling of 
infinity inherent in our conceptions of space and time that appa 
rent infinity is sufficiently accoanted for by simpler and univer 
sally acknowledged laws 

thus we stand on the verge of boundless posnbility what 
truths may yet be discovered in that great and untrodden field 
which lies without our experience no man can tell all we have 
yet brought between assertion and proof is all we have yet con 
quered is all that we as yet know is all that we can yet rely 
upon the search after the untried is the highest and apparently 
the inherent aspiration of man the revelation of new worlds 
continually rewards his noble ambition at once arrested and 
allured by the magnificence of nature— we wonder we work we 
wait

tb in the conformity of tlie operationb of nature these truths 
of intuition or consciousness are the foundation of all knowledge 
truths which we know by way of inference are occurrences 
which took place while we were absent— the events of history 
and the theorems of mathematics but the truths known by 
intuition are the originid premises from which all others are 
inferfed our assent to the conclusion being grounded upon 
the truth of the premises we could never arrive at any knowledge 
by reasoning unlets something oould be known antecedently to 
all reasoning 

 whatever is known to us by consciousness is known beyond 
possibility of question what one sees or feels whether bodily 
or mentally one cannot but be sure that one sees or feels no 
science is required for the purpose of establishing such truths no 
rules of art can render our knowledge of them more certain than 
it is in itself there is no logic for this portion of our know 
ledge 

all discussions pertaining to the nature and limits of intuitica 
•r consciousness are referred to the higher or transcendental meta 
physics but all the facts that compose evidence and become the 
grounds of inference are according to the view taken heri 
necessarily subjects of examination 

coguot go m— i think therefore i am argued des carter 
we learn by this that consciousness of the operations of the mind 
is the strongest evidence of our existence it cannot be proved so 
forcibly by any other means and although des cartes language 
may appear to involve a logical fallacy yet the proof of our per 
sonal existence which we have from thinkings is the fullest and 
best we are acquainted vrithf 

there is a numerous class of facts from which all men draw 
conclusions which facts are not referable o the evidence of the 
senses there are the facts of testimony testimony is founded on 
laws almost as fixed and certain as those of nature all our know 
ledge sclentlbc literary historical— all except what arises from 
our experience and consciousness — depends on it in the ad 
ministration of justice it is the sole guardian of property and 
life if a man of known integrity and veracity state a factp

no understandiag or oouosioa with him state the same men ase 
nearly as certain of it as of any tmth in mathematics i beliere 
in the existence of rome and the facts of astronomy on thia 
evidence although i never saw the dty or examined the stars 
through a telescope 

the conclusiveness of testimony is designated moral certainty 
the value of testimony depends on three things on the 
nature of the subject some subjects are capable of more ac 
curate observation than others on the powers and character 
of the observer— his ability to understand or note that of which 
he testifies— and his honesty in common matters on the 
number of our informers several persons are less likely to be 
imposed upon than one 

testimony or moral certainty is inferior to physical certainty 
a physical certainty bears uniformly the name of otainty while 
 moral certainty is characterised as a probability great very 
great may be the probability still it is less in reliableness than a 
physical certainty the evidence of cato or aristides would be 
very eondasiveyet somewhat less certain than that which onr 
own senses have proved 

the condttsions from moral certainties are obtained like other 

eondnsions by induction the induction from moral facts is 

like the induction from phyncal facts with this difference— that 

the conclusions from mord facts are probabilities like the facts 

on which they are founded whatever has physical certdnty in 

its favour is considered demonstrable and when sufficient probable 

evidence is adduced in favour of a proposition it is considered to 

be fdrly proved some persons biased by the strictness of 

mathematicd proof insiflt upon the same accuracy in mord 

investigations i have elsewhere pointed out the juvenility and 

infatuation of this error insist upon demonstration where the 

nature of the questions admits it less should not in such case 

suffice accept probability where probability is the ide evidence 

attainable never ask more than reason can grant we must 

admit gradations of validity what we are consdous of wo 

know all we recdve on testimony we believe physicd oet

hume remarks in his essay on probabiuties that mr locke 



 facts 

divides all argnmerifs into demmstrative and probable in tbis 
few we must say that it is only probable all men must die or 
that the sun will rise tomorrow but to conform our language 
more to common as we ought to divide arguments into demoff 
ttrohomf proofs and probabilihet by proofs meaning such 
arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or oppo 
sition 

conjecture is probable truth some subjects only furnish a 
sufircient number of facts to make them probable in the lowest 
degree — not to decide them as positively true the propo 
sitions expressing results pertaining to such subjects are called 
conjectures 

a conjecture founded on no fact or upon too few to make it 
likely is called a vagary 

it will be seen that probability is a thing of degree a proba 
bility may vary in weight from a moral certainty where it ranks 
next to a physical certainty down to a conjocture and descend 
lower in likelihood till it is lost in conjecture 

lord kames remarks in his preface to his sketches moat of 
the subjects handled in the following sheets admit but of pro 
bable reasoning i and with respect to such reasoning it is often 
difficult to say what degree of conviction they ought to produce 
it is easy to form plausible arguments but to form such as can 
stand the test of time is not always easy i could amuse the 
reader with numerous examples of conjectural arguments which 
fair at a distant view vanish like a cloud on a near approach 
did all authors so judiciously apprise their readers of the pro 
bable logical value of their speculations fewer would be misled 
than now 

to numerous questions of undoubted interest which have been 
agitated in all ages only a moderate degree of certainiy attaches 
—these are termed speculative such subjects may afford but 
few facts and instances and the chances of conclusiveness may 
seem remote — yet ultimate results are not to be despaired of the 
new comparison of conjectures and the arrangement of facts 
daily throws new light on agecontested points systems of 
conduct should not be founded on conjectures in opposition to 
evident moral utility but if speculatioo is kept within th

there are problems in metaphysics as there are in mithematlcsy 
which may be demonstrated to be insolvable to describe the 
limit of human power vrith respect to contested questions will 
yet result from speculatiye controversy the capacities of our 
understanding will be one day well considered the extent of our 
knowledge discovered and the horizon found which sets bounds 
between the enhghtened and the dark part of things — between 
what is and what is not comprehensible by us but this will 
only be when the untried has been universally attempted in all 
directions bailey i think has defined truth as being that 
which is universally accepted after having been universally 
examined little of this truth is yet extant when every man 
shall be a thinker when the autobiography of intellect shall be 
more freely furnished than it ever yet has been unanimity of 
opinion not yet dreamed of will prevail harmony of opinion 
is the sign of intellectual conquest — the standardbearer of truth 
no advocacy is victorious while dissent occupies the field 

what we know to be true is knowledge what we have only 
reason to believe true is opmion all human information is 
made up of knowledge and opinion the primary importance of 
knowledge is evident from the fact that knowledge is the umpire 
of all opinion we believe in the existence of the ruins of pal 
myra and thebes and in certain discoveries of algebraists and 
astronomers it is our opinion that these things are true although 
we may never have visited palmyra or thebes nor made the cal 
culations of the algebraist nor the observations of the astronomer 
in these cases our belief is founded on our experience and know 
ledge of mankind it is qote true that travellers exaggerate 
and scientific men are sometimes mistaken but we know that 
there is always some truth at the bottom of what is communicated 
by wellneaning writers more or less every mans exverience 
assures him of this and it is the cause of our reliance 
on the records of history and the reports of science there 
fore since all information is made up of knowledge and 
opinion plainly knowledge is the one thing which comprises 
all intelligence 

 questions of fact observes pascal in hiscelebrated provincial 
ietters are only to be determined by the senses ii what yoa 



 facts 

assert be true prove it to be so if it be aot yoq labour in tela 
to induce belief all the authority in the world cannot enforce 
or alter belief as to facts nothing can possibly have power to 
cause that not to be which actually it 

a remarkable instance of the verification of what wa asbnmed 
to be is related of pascal by goodrich pascal was a philosopher 
even in childhood at a very early age he was taught the ten 
commandments for several days after he was observed to be 
measuring the growth of a blade of grass when asked the 
meaning of this he replied the fourth commandment says 
 six days shalt thou labour but the seventh is the sabbath in 
which thou shalt do no work now i wished to ascertain if na 
ture obeyed this great law and therefore measured the grass to 
see if it grew as much on sunday as on other days f 

 we are informed says beattie by father malebranche that 
the senses were at first as honest faculties as one could desire to 
be endued with till after they were debauched by original nn 
an adventure from which they contracted such an invincible pro 
pensity to cheating that they are now continually lying in wait to 
deceive us but there is in man it seems a certain clearsighted 
stout old faculty called reaton which without being deceived by 
appearances keeps an eye upon the rogues and often proves too 
cunning for them 

though it is so abundantly obvious that the evidences of our 
senses internal and external are in effect the sources of all 
certainty yet we are not warranted in rejecting as mere hypo 
thesis every theory which we cannot at once corroborate when 
euler remarked of his new law of arches this will be found 
true though contrary to all experience— when gall exclaimed of 
his new philosophy of the sensorium this is true though opposed 
to the philosophy of ages —they expressed demonstrable truths 
ludden from the multitude they announced new generalisations 
to man new truths are commonly found to be old unnoted 
experiences for the first time subjected to classification and pre 
sented in a scientific form 

to me it seems almost in vain to urge men to notice facts who 
have never noticed themselves the tmest standards of certain

the unprincipled victimise their fsuows tou have therefore to

the welfare of thy fellow men men are not wellnatmred and w

impulse of his nature he leivei justice— the bandit on ths 
throne as well as the bandit in the forest respects justice is

of innocence and courage he loves fraternity— it knits society 
together in brotherhood thom are standards his codes of life 
and judgment arise from these aspirations that which accords 
with these principles is reatonable whatever develops these 
principles m conduct is moral these sentiments are to be con 
firmed by his own observations his experience in connection 
with these rules is the hght with which he may examine religions 
creeds books systems opinions 

the right understanding of physical and moral fhets greatly 
depends upon intelleotual character— and there enters largely 
into the recondite and ultimate inquiries of intelligent m 
another class of facts called mental facts there is no chance of 
identifying these without the power of selfanalysis which is one 
reason why metaphysic ability belongs to so fsw and why ques

enigmas to the majority of the people the illiterate in these 
things are easily led or misled by words they who will not bow

with regard to the analysis of groups of facts mr j s mill 
remarks — the observer is not he who merely sees the thing 
before his eyes but he who sees what parts that thing is composed 
of to do this well is a rare talent one person from inatten 
tion or attending only in the wrongplace overlookis half of what 
he sees another sets down much more than he sees confounding 
it with what he imagines or with what he infers another takes 
note of the kind of all the circumstances but being inexpert in 
estimating their degree leaves the quantity of each vague and 
vnoertain another jwes indeed the whole bnt makes such an 
awkward division of it into parts throwing things into one mass 
which require to be separated and separating others which 
might more conveniently be considered as one that the result is 
much the same sometimes even worse than if no analysis had 
been attempted at all

dififering from the others said it was blue the next witness 
described it as a light marble but said it had a dark appearance 
as if it had been bronsed and the last witness spoke of it as

all these witnesses agree as to the faot in dispute but th

 upwards of twenty years ago says george combe i accom 
panied a member of the bar of paris a philosopher and a man of 
letters on a visit to the highlands of scotland at gallendar a 
boy of twelve orthiftefen years of age attended as a guide to 
some interesting spot and in external appearance he seemed to 
be in every respect one of the common lads of the village my 
parisian friend entered into conversation with him asked him 
if he had been at sehool and soon discovered that to a tolerable 
acquaintance with the greek and latin languages he added a 
pretty extensive knowledge of arithmetic and geography and 
wbs then engaged ia thb study of mathematics my friend con 
ceived that the boy was an average specimen of the peasantry 
of the countty and greatly admired the educational attainments 
of the scotch people which he had previously heard highly 
extolled but adds mr oombe the boy was the natural son of 
an english olbeer who had resided in the neighbourhood and 
who while he ordered him to be reared in the hardy habits of 
the scottiih bkghkmdersy had provided ample funds for his 
mental education 

it is difficult to believe in this frenchman being a philosophftty 
making as he did a national indnrtionfrom a singleinstance had 
he previously inquired as he ought to have done the particulars of 
that lads life and rearing before coming to so large a conclusion 
he would at once have discovered the error he was fouing into 

in the registrar generals report of the mean of mar 
ried persons unable to write is presented the conclusion is 
based upon the statistics of mine counties but when it was found 
that only three per ceut of tle persons marriageable did marry 
the datum was found insufficient to afford sure results this feet 
is given by mr combe in the same book then how many boys 
ought our philosopher to have questioned before making us

aofidusionsa 

as respects thoso who deal fai things professedly above reason 
it was well said by an anonymous writer of the old school of 
sturdy thinkers — of such men as these i usually demand 
whether their own assent to tldngs they would have us believe 
be grounded upon some raiumai argtaneiu if they say tis not 
they are fools to beueie it themselves and i shoidd add to the 
number of fools if after this teknowledgment i should believe 
fhem t bat if they say it is i desire them to produce their argu 
ment fer rinoetis framed by a human understanding the foree 
of it may also be comprehended and judged of a human under 
standing t and tis to no purpose to say that the subject surpasses 
human reason r for il it do so indeed it will surpass iheirt as well 
as miney and so leave us both upon even terms and let the thing 
assented to be what it will the assent itself must be founded 
upon ft iuffmcmi reason and consequently upon one that is m

 now the first glance at a proposition shows that it is formed 
by putting together two names a proposition aooording to the 
ciommon simple definition which is sufficient for our purpose is 
dueourte m tohkh iomethmg tm affirmed or denied of tomeddng 
thus in the proposition gold is yellow the quality yeuow is 
affirmed of the substance gold the proposition franklin was 
not bom in england the fact expressed by the words ftomm 
england is denied of the man franklin 

every propodtion consists of three parts the subject the 
predicate and the copula the predicate is the name denoting 
that which is affirmed or denied the subject is the name de 
noting the person or thing which something is affirmed or denied 
of the copula is the rign denoting that there is an affirmatioq 
or denial and thereby enabling the hearer or reader to dis 
tinguish a proposition from any other kind of discourse thus 
in the proposition the earth is round the predicate is the word 
rounds which denotes the quality affirmed or as the phrase is 
predicated the earth words denoting the object which that 
quality is affirmed of compose the snbject the word it which 
serves as the connecting mark between the subject and predicats 
to show that one of them isnffinned of the other is called the 
copula

 a ntxme ii a wof d taken at pleasure to serre for a mark which 
may raise in oar mind a thought like to some thought we bad 
before and which being pronounced to others may be to them a 
sign of what thought the speaker had before in his mind hobbes 
this simple definition of a name as a word or set of words 
serving the double purpose of a mark to recall to ourselves the 
likeness of a former thought and a ugn to make it known to 
others appears unexceptionable 

definition originates in accurate and comprehensive observa 
tion there cannot be says mill agreement about the definition 
of a thing until there is agreement about the thing itself to 
define a thing is to select from among the whole of its properties 
those which shall be understood to be designated and declared by its 
name and the properties must be very well known to us before 
we can be competent to determine which of them are fittest to be 
chosen for this purpose 

 the simplest and most correct notion of a definition is a pro 
position declaratory of the meaning of a word namely dther 
th meaning which it bears in common acceptation or that which 
the speaker or writer for the particular purposes of his discourse 
intends to annex to itt 

but with most persons the object of a definition is merely to 
guide them to the correct use of a term as a protection against 
applying it in a manner inconsistent with custom and conven 
tion anything therefore is to them a sufficient definition of m 
term which will serve as a correct index to what the term denotes 
although not embracing the whole and sometimes perhaps not 
even any part of what it connotes 

definitions are sometimes explained as being of two kindtkf 
things and words 

the definition of words is the explanation of the sense in which 
they are used 

the definition of things is an explanation of the specific proper 
ties by which they differ from all other things 

to define a thing says dr watts we must ascertain with 
what it agrees then note the most remarkable attribute of 
difference and join the two together

a name not unfrequently passes by successive links of resem

the name was given which however do not for that reason 
drop the name so that it at last denotes a confused huddle of 
objects having nothing whatever in common and connotes no 
thing not even a vague and general resemblance when a name 
has fallen into this state in which by predicating it of any object 
we assert literally nothing about the object it has become unfit 
for the purposes either of thought oi of the communication of 
thought and can only be made ervxbeable by stripping it of 
some part of its multiforious denotation and confining it to ob 
jects possessed of some attributes in common which it may be made 
to connote such are the inconveniencesof a language which il 
not made but grows like a road which is not made but haf

this is an argument of mad de stael in allusion to the beheading 
of women in france without allowing them any voice in making 
the laws which determine the offences for which they suffered 

a syllogism is constructed upon the principle known as the 
dictum of aristotle that whatever is affirmed or denied univer 
sally of a whole class of things may be affirmed or denied of any 
thing comprehended in that class thus the first proposition 
introduces the class of persons who have their heads cut off of 
this class it is affirmed that they ottght to be allowed to ask the 
reason why but women are included in the class of persons who 
have their heads cut off and consequentiy that may be affirmed of 
them which is affirmed of the whole class— that they ahouli b 
allowed to ask the reason why

although all ratiocination admits of being thrown into one or 
the other of these forms and sometimes gains considerably by 
the transformation both in clearness and in the obviousness of its 
consequence there are no doubt cases in which the argument 
falls more naturally into one of the other three figures and 
in which its conclusiveness is more apparent at the first glance in 
those figures than when reduced into the first thus if the pro 
position were that pagans may be virtuous and the evidence to 
prove it were the example of aristides i a syllogism in the third 
figure 

aristides was virtuous 

aristides was a pagan 

therefore 

• some pagan was virtuous 

 

tviuld be a more natural mode of stating the argument anci 
would carry conviction more instantly home than the same ratio 
cinatlon strained into the first figure thns

aiistides was irtuoos 
some pagan was aristidesy 

therefore 
some pagan was yirtnous 

the best thing that can be said in favour of the lyllogiim aa 
an instrument of reasoning is that it is a regular form to which 
erery valid argument can be reduced and may be accompanied 
by a rule showing the validity of every argument in that otm 
and consequently the unsoundness of any apparent argument 
which cannot be reduced to it this would be high praise if 
every valid argument was a trusty one but unfortunately the 
question respecting the validity of an argument is not whether 
the conclusion be true but whether it fouowi from the premises 
adduced even this small advantage is purchased at a greater 
expense of tedium and trouble than the bulk of mankind are 
willing to pay or able to pay if they were willing 

there is some reason to brieve that the syllogistic form as a 
test of valid arguments may be entirely dispensed with if we 
can secure accuracy of data and intelligibility in terms 

it is not contended now that we discover new truths by the 
syllogism the syllogism is allowed to be only a form of ttattng a 
truth example — 

no predacious animals are ruminant 
the lion is predacious 

therefore 
the lion is not ruminant 

of course if we know that no animal that lives by prey chews 
the cud and know also that the lion lives by prey we know that 
the lion does not chew the cud this conclusion as lord kamesi 
contends and dr whately admits is nitttui inferred from the 
fundamental premises but inclttded in it smart whom mr j 
s mill calls acute and often profound remarks— every one as to 
the mere act of reasoning reamms rightly ve may reason from 
wrong premises or mistake right ones we may be unable 
to infer from proper ones but from such premises as we do 
reason from we reason correctly for au premises contain their 
conclusion and in knowing the premises we therefore know the

the strength and weakness of the syllogism as an instra

that lince all reasoning may be resolred into syllogisms 
and since in a syllogism the premises do virtnauy assert the con 
eloiion it follows at once that no new truth can be elicited by 
any process of reasoning we therefore no longer look to the 
syllogism to diacover tmth its ralne is in stating it in this 
sense it is worthy of all attention it is the form of nature 

of such a syllogism as the one qnoted — 

no predacious animals are ruminant 
the hon is predacious 

therefore 
the hon is not ruminant 
it has been insisted by seme logicians that the genius required 
fof its constinetion was invention haying made a general pro 
position hke the first we then have to invent or find out a middle 
term as the seconil— but if we bear in mind that the general 
affirmation of the first proposition relates to a class of predacious 
animals in this case objects which include the middle term 
the necessity of invention is consequently dispensed with we 
need only look well to what we have there simplicity will be pro 
moted by returning to our previous remark viz — that reasoning is 
asserting a proposition and then showing why it is true—in other 
words adducing the fact or facts on which the assertion rests 

in the logic given in chambers information it is said — in 
choosing yonr middle terms or arguments to prove any question 
always take such topics as are purest and least fallible and 
which carry the greatest evidence and strength with them but 
it rather appears that we have not to invent a middle term but 
only to look to the major premises and find it included there 

by methodical questioning any argument may be tested 
thus on any assertion being made ask — why is the assertion 
true in this manner if an argument has truth in it it may be 
ehdted in this manner yon dig through assertions down to 
psemisesy and discover whether any ore of truth lies there

the ralne of the argument depends upon the final answer 
which reveals the premises or data of facts npon which the con 
clusion rests forms of speech classificition of propositions 
figures of syllogisms are of minor importance when you have 
once elicited the rough truth the best test of an argument is 
the soundness of its data and the simplest formnla for drawing 
out and exhibiting such data is of the greatest service in enabling 
us to judge of the validity thereof 

tyranny says cobbett has no enemy so formidable as the pen 
why because the pen pursues tyranny both in life and beyond 
the grave how is this proved to be the most formidable enemy 
of tyranny from the fact that tyranny has no enemy so 
formidable as that which assails not only its existence but its 
reputation which pursues it in life and beyond the grave such 
interrogatories and replies generate the expository syllogism 

 tyranny has no enemy so formidable as that which assails 
not only its existence but its reputation which pursues it in life 
and beyond the grave 

 the pen pursues tyranny in life and beyond the grave 

 therefore tyranny has no enemy so formidable as the pen 
a syllogism is made up of collective and single facts it is the 

process of reasoning whereby we show that a single truth is 
proved by a collective one which contains it or a less quantity 
is proved by a greater or that an assertion is proved by an induc 
tion from a class of facts from the class of the enemies of 
tyranny the pen is selected and is proved by passing in inductive 
review the whole class to be the most formidable 

the usual manner in which an argument is presented is calied 
ie enthymeme thus — 

he is an industrious man 

therefore 

he will acquire wealth 
the first or major proposition is in this form suppressed the 
syllogistic form would be this — 

evry industrious man acquires wealthj 
he is an industrious man 

therefore 
he will acquire wealth 
but if we ask for the proof that every industrious man acquires 
wealth we find the facts wanting—for the idle are often rich

and tlie diligent poor the indastrioob may acquire wealth the 
chances are in thdr fayonr 

again we must cherish selfrespect 

becaase selfrespect is the stay of virtue 

the suppressed proposition ia we must cherish whateyer ia 
the stay of virtue 

the whole syllogism then stands thus — 

we must cherish whatever is the stay of virtue 
selfrespect is the stay of virtue 

therefore 
we must cherish selfrespect 

dilemma is derived from a greek word and signifies twice an 
argument it is an argument divided into several members and 
infers of each part what is to be inferred of the wholtf thus 
either we shall live or die if we live we can only live happily 
by being virtuous and if we die we can only die happy by being 
virtuous therefore we ought always to be virtuous in the 
dilemma question one argument at a time as in preceding cases 

the sorites uses several middle terms by which the predicate 
of the last proposition is connected with the first subject of 
this argument the wellknown speech of themistodes is a speci

his mother governs me i govern the athenians the athenians 
govern greece greece governs europe and europe governs the 
world therefore my son governs the world in these instances 
question each assertion as there are as many acts of reasoning 
as intermediate propositions 

the onus probandi or burden of proof is said to rest with 
him who would dispute any point in £avour of a presumptive or 
generally allowed truth but manly logic holds no qalbbling 
about who shall prove whatever he asserts the honest reasoner 
should be prompt to prove

induction is an inference from many facts induction is verifies

whole so in induction we show that a part is illustrated by the 
whole it seems that every single fact eontains many truths but

 law is the science in which the greatest powers of understanding 
are applied to the greatest number of facts the bant of cdl 
science is such an extensiye induction of particulars as leads to 
general definitions and fimdamental axioms and furnishes the 
premises from which inferences may be deduced 

inductiye observation is the great instrument of discovering 
important truths what are called the principles of human 
nature are learned from individual instances it is the only 
possible way of learning them when we reason from a 
general law or principle we are in truth reasoning from a number

monsieur de montmorine was recaptured and brought to the 
scaffold through the trifling circumstance of some chicken bones 
being found near the door of his landlady — a woman too poor to 
indulge in uch dainties the discovery of de montmorine was 
not as at first sight appears an inference ftom a single fact but 
from an adjacent induction it was a general truth known to 
the party who observed the bones a truth inducted from a num 
ber of facts that poor people could not afford to luxuriate on chick 
ens it was therefore from this induction inferred that some 
one of superior fortune must be living in that particular place 

the judicious care which the great fathers of science have 
exhibited in making their inferences incontestibly establishes 
tiieir conviction of the danger of any other reasoning than that 
from inductions lord brougham informs us that what new 
tons frincipla is to science lockes essay to metaphysics 
demosthenes in oratory and homer in poetry cuviers re 
searcnes to our fossil osteology but guvier never attempted 
to draw any inferences until he had examined the wu osteology 
of the living species 

lord brougham remarks that from examining a tmffle frag 
ment of bone we infer that in the wilds where we found it there 
lived and ranged some thousands of years ago an animal of a 
peculiar kind this is a case in which the inference ioken of 
is arrived at in a way different from that apparently stated we 
recognise in the fragment of bone a link in a chain of facts 
constituting the basis of a wellknown induction which compara 
tive anatomy has many times verified it is important to di 
tinguish well the grounds from which accurate inferences such 
as these in the cases before us have really been adduced in ordex 
to ascertain the grounds from which we should reason generally 
it will be found that solid reasoning can only proceed from 
general rules— t inductions from facts it will be found that 
the prime source of fallacy lies in reasoning from isolated facts 
it is not to be denied that such reasoning is sometimes right but 
it is to be remembered that it is right by accident not by design 
there is no science or certainty in it it is hazard not logic

 not only may we leatoe from patticiilars to particidarb without 
pmsing tiirough genenu bat we perpetually do to reason all 
our earliest inferences are of this nature from the first dawn of 
intelligence we draw inferences bat years elapse before we learn 
the ase of general language the child who having burnt his 
lingers avoids to thrust them again into the fire has reasoned 
or inferred though he has never thought of the general maxim — 
fire bums he knows from memory that he has been burnt and 
en this evidence believes when he sees a candle that if he puts 
his fingers into the flame of it he will be burnt agmn he b 
lieves this in every case which happens to arise but without 
looking in each instance beyond the present case he is not 
generalising he is inferring a particular from particulars la 
the same way also brutes reason there is little or no ground 
for attributing to any of the lower animals the use of conven 
tional signs withoat whieh general propositions are impossible 
but those animals profit by experience and avoid what they have 
found to cause them pain in the same manner though not 
always with the same skill as a human creature not only the 
burnt child but the burnt dog dreads the fire 

 i believe that in point of fact when drawing inferences from 
oar personal experience and not from maxims handed down to 
os by books or tradition we much oftener conclude from 
particulars to particulars directly than through the intermediate 
agency of any general proposition we are constantly reasoning 
from ourselves to other people or from one person to another 
without giving ourselves the trouble to erect our obsevations into 
general maxims of human or external nature when we con 
dude that some peisoa will on some given occasion feel or act so 
and so we sometisms judge from an enlarged consideration of the 
manner in which man in general or men of some particular cluk 
raoter are accustomed to feel and act but much oftener from 
 having known the feelings and conduct of the same man in some 
previous instance or from considering how we should feel or act 
ourselves it is not only the village matron who when called to 
a consultation upon the case of a neighbours child pronounces 
on the evil and its remedy simply on the recollection and autho 
rity of what she accounts the similar case of her hucy we all 
whare we have no definite maxims to bteer by guide ourselves ia 



utduction 

the btltoe way and if we have an extensive experience and 
retain its impressions strongly we may acquire in this manner a 
very considerable power of accurate judgment which we may be 
utterly incapable of justifying or of communicating to others 
among the higher order of practical intellects there have been 
many of whom it was remarked how admiiably they suited tbdr 
means to their ends without being able to give any suflbcient 
reasons for what they did and appued or seemed to apply re 
condite principles which tiiey were wholly unable to state this 
is a natural consequence of having a mind stored with appropriate 
particulars and having been long accustomed to reason at once 
from these to fresh particulars without practising the habit of 
stating to oneself or to others the corresponding general pro 
positions an old warrior on a rapid glance at the outlines of the 
ground is able at once to give the necessary orders for a skilful 
arrangement of his troops though if he has received little 
theoretical instruction and has seldom been called upon to answer 
to other people for his conduct he may never have had in his 
mind a single general theorem respecting the relation between 
ground and army but his experience of encampments under 
circumstances more or less similar has left a number of vivid un 
expressed ungeneralised analogies in his mind the most appro 
priate of which instantly suggesting itself determines him to a 
judicious arrangement 

 the skill of an uneducated person in the use of weapons or of

 almost every one knows lord mansfields advice to a man of 
practical good sense who being appointed governor of a colony 
had to preside in its court of justice without previous judicial 
practice or legal education the advice was to give his decision 
boldly for it would probably be right but never to venture on 
assigning reasons for they would almost infedlibly be wrong in 
ases like this which are of no uncommon occurrence it would 
be absurd to suppose that the bad reason was the source of 
the good decision lord mansfield knew that if any reason were 
assigned it would be necessarily an afterthought the judge being 
tn fad guided by impressions from past experience without the 
circuitous process of framing general principles from them and 
that if he attempted to frame any such he would assuredly fail 
lord mansfield however would not have doubted that man of 
equal experience who had also a mind stored with general propo 
sitions derived by legitimate induction from that experience 
would have been greatly prefisrable as a judge to one however 
sagacious who could not be trusted with the explanation and jus 
tification of his own judgments the cases of able men perform

that we do well much oftener than we reason well we seldom

 there was a generous friend of mine once who never would 
have judged me or any other man unheard with the sublime 
intensity of one who felt the innite valus of private justice has 
schiller delineated this spirit in the interview between octavio 
and his son max piccolominf after a violent and visible struggle 
with his feelings— wrought upon by his fathers endeavours to 
sow suspicions in his mind and detach him from the service of 
his friend wauenstein— max exclaims t—

my way must be straight on true with the tongue

will i demand of him tmit he do saye

he can he will— i still am his believer 

yet ill not pledfte myself but that those letters

ay— this statepolicy o how curse it 

you will some time witb your statepolicy 

compel him to the measure it may happen 

because ye are deitrmined that he is guilty 

guilty yeu make him all retreat cut off 

you close up avery outlet hem him in 

narrower and narrower till at length ye force him— 

yes ye — ye force him in his desperation 

toset fire to his prison father i father 

that never can end well— it cannot — will not i 

deem of it what then wilt but pardon me 

that i must bear me on in my own way 

all must remain pure betwixt him and me 

and ere the daylight dawns it must be known 

which i must lose— my father or my friend

freadom has been bunted through the world and is ever exposed to 
insult and injury it is crushed by conquest frowned from courts expelled 
trom colleges scorned out ot society hogged in schools and anathematised 
in churches mind is her last asylum and if freedom quail there what be 
comes of the hope of the world or the worth of human nature — w j fozt 
lectures to the working classes part p 

wb should be prepared to dare all things for truth if the very 
hopes of man the thoughts of his heart the religion of nations 
the manners and morals of mankind are all at the mercy of a new 
generalisation we should be prepared to risk them if we must 
choose between truth and repose we ought not to hesitate thert 
is danger in having the truth—philosophers are obliged to 
conceal it mankind vaunt their love of truth but they are not 
to be trusted from interest or ignorance they always persecntt 
and often kill the discoverer still the pursuit of truth is a duty 
and we must find consolation in the heroic reflection of burke that 
m all exertions of duty there is something to be haxarded but 
intellectual daring will never be common while it is so generally 
believed to be criminal we will therefore quote some con 
liderations touching the rightfulness of inquiry 

without inquiry it is impossible for us to know whether our 
opinions are true or false and various are the pretences employed 
for declining investigation frequently they are masked under 
vague and metaphorical phrases inquiry implies the weighing 
of evidence and might lead to doubt and perplexity — to search 
into a subject might shake the settled convictions of the under 
standing — to examine opposite arguments and contradictory 
opinions might contaminate the mind with false views 

 every one who alleges pretexts like these for declining m 
quiryy must obviously begin by assuming hat his own opinion 
are unerringly in the right nothing could justify a man for do 
dining the investigation of a subject involving important opinions 
but the possession of an understanding free from liability of 
error not gifted vrith infallibility in what way except by dill 
gent inquiry can he obtain any assurance that he is not pursuing 
• coarse of injurious action if he holds any opinion he mvst 
kato acquired it either by examination by instillation rote etf 



m xtbusctttal oabima 

gome other process on the supposition that he has acquired it 
hy proper examination the duty on which i am now insisting hat 
been discharged and the matter is at an end— but if he has ac 
quired it in any other manner the mere plea that his mind might 
become unsettled can be no argument against the duty of inyei 
tigation for anything he can allege to the contrary his present 
opinions are wrong — and in that case the disturbance of his 
blind convictions instead of being an evil is an essential step 
towards arriving at the truth 

 it may possibly be assigned as a fiirther reason for his declin 
ing inquiry that he may come to some fallacy which he cannot 
surmount although convinced of its character if he is con 
vinced of its character he must either have grounds for that con 
viction or not if he has grounds let him examine them draw 
them out try if they are valid and then the fetllacy will stand 
exposed if he has no grounds for suspecting a fallacy what an 
irrational cobchuion he confesses himself to have arrived at 
but perhaps he will reply — he may be unable to solve the die 
culty his mind may become perplexed and the issue may prove 
after all that it would have been much better had he remained 
in his iermer strong though unenlightened conviction why 
better if he is in peplexity let him read think consult the 
learned and the wise and in the end he will probably reach a 
desnite opinion on one side or the other but if he should still 
remain in doubt where is the harm or rather why is it not to be 
considered a good the subject is evidently one which admits 
strong probabihties on opposite sides doubt is therefore the 
proper sentiment for the occasion — it is the resnlt of the best 
exercise of the faculties — and either positively to believe or pi 
tivdy to disbelieve would imply an erroneous appreciation of 
evidence 

 in die minds of some people a strong prejudice appears to 
exist against that state of the understanding which is termed 
doubt a little reflection however will convince any one that 
on certain subjects doubt is as appropriate a state of the rea 
¦ming faculties as belief or disbelief on others there are doc 
trines propositions facts supported and opposed by every degree 
of evidence and amongst them by that degree of evidence of 
which the proper effect is to leave the understandag in an eqiili 
ijoise between two conclusions in these cam ioubt u the 



nrrslleotual dabimo ti 

appropriate retalt which there can be no reaion to shrink from 
tit lament bat it may be further nrged that inquiry migiit 
foathminate the understanding with false views — and therefore 
it is wise and laudable to abstain from it 

 we can comprehend what is meant by contaminating a 
aians habits or disposition or even imagination but there 
is no analogy on these points in reference to the understand 
ing there is contamination there is evil in preposterous 
and obscene images crowding before the intellectual vision not 
withstanding a full and distinct perception of their character— 
bat there is no contamination no evil in a thousand false argu 
ments coming before the understanding if their quality is clearly 
discerned the only possible evil in this case is mistaking false 
for true— but the man who shrinks from investigation lest he 
should mistake false for true can have no reason for supposing 
himself free from that delusion in his actual opinions besides 
these objections to inquiry there are other prejudices of a similar 
character forming serious impediments to the attainment of truth 

 one of these is a fear thai we may search too far and beconu 
chargeable with pretumption in prying into things ue ought not to 
know a few words will suffice to prove that nothing can be 
more irrational and absurd we have already sbon that true 
opinions are conducive to the welfare of mankind — and the prose 
cution of inquiry is therefore a process from which we have 
everything to hope and nothing to fear and to which there are 
no uroits but such as the nature of our own faculties pre 
scribes 

a second prejudice— that we may eotitract guilt if in the 
course of our researches we miss the right conclusion and had 
therefore better let inquiry aloneis still more influential in pre 
venting those investigations which it is our duty to make as 
oar opinions on any subject are not voluntary acts but involuntary 
effects in whatever conclusions oar researches terminate they can 
involve us in no culpability all that we have to take care of is 
to bestow on every subject an adequate and impartial attention 
having done this we have discharged our duty and it would be 
irrational and unmanly to entertain any apprehension for the 
malt 

 in fact there is the grossest inconsistency in the prejudice now 
under consideration if we may contract guilt by searching after 



w intellectual dabino 

truth wo may equally do so by remaining in oar present tta to 
the reason alleged in the prejudice itself and the only reason 
which can be assignee with any plausibility why we may commit 
an offence by embarking in any inquiry is that we may by so 
doing miss the right conclusion or in other words fall into error 
—for no one would seriously contend that we incur any moral 
culpability by an investigation which conducts us to the truth 
but it is obvious that we may equally miss the right condn 
sion by remaining in our actual opinions it is then incum 
bent on us to ascertain whether we are committing an offence 
by remaining in them — in other words it is necessary to exo 
nune whether those opinions are true thus the reasons 
assigned for not inquiring lead to the conclusion that it is 
necessary to inquire • 

 the third prejudice is that acquiescence in received opinions 
or forbearing to think for ourselves shows a degree of humility 
liighly proper and commendable— if closely examined will be 
found usually to evince nothing but a great degree of indolent 
presumption or intellectual cowardice there is often in truth 
as great a measure of presumption in this species of acquiescence 
as in the boldest hypothesis which human invention can start 
that received and established opinions are true is one of those 
sweeping conclusions which would require very strong reasons 
and often elaborate research to justify on what grounds are they 
considered to be true by one who declines investigation be 
cause on the most favonrable supposition they have been handed 
down to us by our predecessors and have been held with unhesi 
tating faith by a multitude of illustrious men but what com 
prehensive reasons are these what investigation would it re • 
quire to shew that they were valid as the whole history of man 
kind teems with instances of the transmission of the grossest 
errors from one generation to another and of their having beea 
countenanced by the concurrence of the most eminent of our race 
—how without examination can we show that mil partimlar in 
f tance is an exception from the general lot 

 from the necessity of using our own judgment or in other 
words of arriving at a conclusion for ourselves we cannot be ab 
solved far from being a virtue blind acquiescence in the 
opinions of others is in most cases a positive vice tending to stop 
u advancement in knowledge and all improvement in pracuoib 



imtelleotljal dabino tt 

from the preceding it is evident that the inquirer may enter 
on his task with full confidence that he is embarking in no 
criminal or forbidden or presumptuous enterprise but is on 
the contrary engaging in the discharge of a duty let hia 
be as circumspect as he pleases in collecting his facts and do 
ducing his conclusions cautions in the process but fearleu 
in the result let him be fully aware of his liability to error 
of the thousand sources of illusions of the limited powers 
of the individual of the paramount importanire of truth — but 
jet him dismiss au apprefiemions of the issue of an investi 
gation conducted with due application of mind and rectitude 
of purpose 

marcus antoninus indeed said i seek aqr truth by which no 
tan yet was ever injured but there is a great practical mistake 
here there it danger in truth— and the admission should be 
plainly made men where forewarned make the choice more 
manfully we have been wisely told by emerson that tho 
cherished thoughts and inetitutions of mankind are at the mercy 
of a new generalisation— rest commodity reputation inconve 
nience and suspense are the consequences of the partisanship of 
truth certain political truths annihilate the interests of whole 
classes certain social truths war with lifecherished prejudices 
certain sanitary truths reduce the value of all city property 
certain scientific truths ruin the working classes by thousands 
in a wiser state of society this could be prevented but our pre 
sent business is with what m it is therefore idle to conceal the 
truth — that there is danger in truth popes dictum that party 
is the madness of many for the gain of a few is inversely true of 
truth truth is the ultimate benefit of many but the immediate 
ruin of the few here however comes to our aid the wise and 
farseeing aphorism of burke in all exertions of duty there is 
something to be hazarded— and the brave man and wise friend of 
mankind will risk the fate which surely awaits him— the fate of 
galileo newton salomon de cans volta fulton winser ark 
wright gall and all who present themselves with truth in their 
hands at the door of this great bedlam called the world— the fate

idolg 

tbb term idol is employed by bacon to designate those prejndioei 
which men prefer to truth a prejudice is a bias without a 
reason for it an opinion without a foundation a judgment formed 
of persons and things without sufficient examination an assent 
given to a proposition without sufficient evidence the bias may 
be honourable the opinion correct the assent in the right direotiob 
but still of the nature of prejudice because if right it is right 
by accident rather than design 

ignorance hides from us facts and we decide partially rather 
than confess our deficiency illdirected education gives us pr 
onessions which are obstacles in the way of truth and we con 
tinue to cherish what having become a part of our nature it 
ns us to discard the senses will occasionally mislead us 
and although we are conscious that appearances are not to be 
wholly trusted we reluctantly doubt our own infallibility 
from early and therefore unquestioned associations we have 
acquired certain habits and from fashion certain sentiments 
and we continue old customs and fall into the current opinion 
unconsciously of these sources of prejudice logic warns us 
to beware of so much importance did bacon regard these 
hindrances to truth that he considered the pursuit of new 
truth hopeless while they were cherished in a mixed vein of 
poetry and philosophy he divided prejudices into four classes 
irhich he called idols of the tribe the den the market 
and the theatre idols of the tribe are prejudices men imbibe 
from early training and love of hypothesis they are so called 
because common to the whole race or tribe of manund idob of 
the den are those which relate to a mans particular character 
idols of the market are those which are accommodated to common 
notions idols of the theatre denote such as pertain to hypq 
thetical systems of philosophy 

remembering the declarations of euler and gall and the daily 
discoveries of science we should stand as it were on the verge 
of fhi old world of experience and look out on the new world of 
truth a young thinker should make for himself a chart of pro 
poied refoimsi iystems and changet agitated in his day— plact

 all men possessed of an uncontrolled discretionary power 
leading to the aggrandisement and profit of their own body have 
always abused it — burkes thoughti on the present discontentt 

the student will find the proof of this proposition exhibited in

 a good instance of a metaphorical argument drawn out ii 
given by mr mill — for instance when mr carlyle rebuking 
the byronic vein says that strength does not manifest itself in 
spasms but in stout bearing of burdens the metaphor proves 
nothing it is no argument only an allusion to an argument in 
no other way however could so much of argument be so com 
pletely suggested in so few words the expression suggests • 
whole train of reasoning which it would take many sentences to 
write out at length as thuss motions which are violent but 
brief which lead to no end and are not under the control of tiit 
trill are in the physical body more incident to a weak than to n

its oidinary coarse by transient inflaences t which may equally be 
said of the mind and this sasceptibiuty whether of mind or 
body must arise from a weakness of the forces which maintain 
and carry on the ordinary action of the system all this is con 
veyed in one short sentence and since the causes are alike in 
the body and in the mind the analogy is a jut one and the 
marim holds of the one as much as of the other 

 a youth named evathlus engaged with protagoras to learn 
dialectics and promised his tutor a large sum of money in case 
he gained the first cause he pleaded evathlus when fully in 
structed refused to pay his instructor protagoras brought his 
action thus— you must pay the money however the cause go 
for if i gain you must pay in consequence of the sentence as 
being cast in the cause and if you gain it you must pay in pur 
suance of our covenant nay evathlus retorts which way 
soever the cause be decided you will have nothing for if i pre 
vail the sentence gives it that nothing is due and if i lose then 
there is nothing due by the covenant what should be the 
decision in this case 

j the first case says oervantes requiring sanchos attention 
was a question put by a stranger in presence of the stewards and 
rest of the attendants my lord said he a certain manor if 
divided by a large river i beg your honour will be attentive for 
the case is of great consequence and of some difficulty i say 
then upon this river is a bridge and at one end of it the gibbet 
together with a sort of court hall in which four judges usually dt 
to execute the law enacted by the lord of the river bridge and 
manor which runs to this effect t whoever shall pass this bridge 
must first swear whence he comes and whither he goes if he 
swear the truth he shall be allowed to pass but if he forswear 
liimself he shall die upon the gallows without mercy or respite 
this law together with the rigorous penalty being knowni
