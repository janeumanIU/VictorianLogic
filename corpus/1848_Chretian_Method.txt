vi preface 



the very simple division of sciences which i have 
adopted will excite a smile in some who have 
approached the same subject from another quarter 
but it is perfectly defensible if the principles of 
this work be in other respects true without 
being the best or the only scheme it may yet be 
valid and logical 

to confess myself conscious of many faults in 
this essay is a poor apology for leaving them un 
corrected they would have been more numerous 
but for a reason which i have great pleasure in 
being permitted to mention both the essay and 
its author are under more obligations than can be 
particularised to his dear friends and brotherfeuows 
the reverend george buckle and mr john 
william burgon

weapon may be wielded to advantage not how 
the whole armoury may be employed in concert 
with good effect 

and without any disparagement to later labourers 
in this fields it may be said that such other 
guides to the knowledge of method as are not 
palpably superficial start from first premises too 
unlike those which we semischolastics of oxford 
still retain to be naturally adopted as instructors 
in our school instead of extending the old line 
of enquiry they turn to one which is altogether 
new and where yre are expecting explanation 
give us contrast or their turn is physical rather 
than logical they insist more on the facts which 
method embodies than on the formal process of 
their embodiment 

it would be wide of oiu purpose to discuss any 
schemes of method which are built on other than 
a logical groundwork however true and ex 
cellent they may be logic is not the porch through 
which to approach them and yet it is most 
unlikely that no entrance lies to method through 
this vestibule when we owe to the schoolmen and 
their successors so much of our scientific phrase 
ology so many of the terms which hang loose 
between exact and popular usage and serve to 
bridge over for good or for evil as the causeway 
so formed is employed the gap which separates 
sciolism and science when we take so commonly 
as our material the fragments of their mosaicwork 



introduction 



it seems unnatural and unwise not to say ungrate 
ful to pay no attention to the plan according to 
which they arranged them doubtless they were 
fitted for their original use and we may learn 
much jfrom considering the nature of this use 
although we may not think proper to adopt it 

possibly then the domain of logical speculation 
is not so fiilly occupied as to leave no room for 
the following essay our object is to view logic 
at once by the light of the past and the present 
to enquire in the first place what ideas respecting 
its nature were formerly entertained and what 
questions originated fiom their adoption how one 
race of thinkers profited both by the knowledge 
and the mistakes of those preceding them and 
handed down the results of their labours to their 
successors not without a still abiding mixture of 
error — and this done to show how truths ad 
vancing fiom different quarters meet at last and 
unite peaceably where we might have feared a 
collision how as logic has always of her own 
firee will testified to the truth of science science 
in her turn bears unintentional but not involuntary 
witness to the truth and utility of logic 

the former part of this essay therefore is 
mainly historical the latter regards rather the 
present state of knowledge and aims at illustrating 
the close connection between logical and scientific 
method the general fact of their connection 
one consideration alone would serve to establish

 introduction 

it cannot be by a mere accidental coincidence that 
logic and science both point to a deductive system 
as the perfect type of method this they do on 
grounds perfectly distinct the logician asserts 
the supremacy of deduction because it exhibits 
most naturally the powers of his favourite instru 
ment the syuogism because it assigns with the 
greatest deflniteness and precision to the pro 
position and the term their respective places and 
importance the man of science also takes deduc 
tion as the type of excellence because he finds that 
as matter of fact the deductive sciences are the most 
perfect it would not at first strike the logician 
that mathematics exhibited the fiill power of the 
syllogism or the mathematician that his pursuits 
illustrated the chief exercise of logic but a little 
thought shows either party that there is a real 
conformity not only in the results but in the 
process by which they attain them each is 
attracted by the same feature in a deductive system 
that is as we shall see hereafter the perfect 
manner in which it imites in itself subordination 
and consequentiality 

where then there is on the whole such general 
agreement we should expect to find it pervading 
the details also here however it does not at 
first appear science says httle of universals and 
particulars of distribution and nondistribution of 
judgment and discourse while on the peculiar 
features and arrangements of each particular 



introduction 



science logic is of course equally silent but on 
reflection another class of terms occur which 
logic and science use in common such are 
conception and idea genus and species analysis 
and synthesis the vague use of words like these 
is an evil which we ought not unnecessarily to 
tolerate metaphorical in some sense they must 
be but the nature and extent of the metaphor 
deserves to be considered and the further ques 
tion naturally arises not only from what they have 
been transferred but to whom their use in 
differently by logicians and men of science suggests 
the supposition that science has taken them 
improperly from logic or logic from science but 
it is satisfactory to discover that some knowledge 
of the nature of method renders either hypothesis 
unnecessary that it is with regard to method that 
the terms have gained their meaning and pre 
serving that meaning are derived with equal 
propriety to science on the one hand and logic 
on the other 

the idea of method indeed is prior to that of 
either science or logic it is simpler where they 
are more complex it enters into every thing 
which admits of arrangement and order there 
is method in placing in a row a number of mine 
ralogical specimens according to their external 
resemblance though this is not a science there 
is method in grouping together a number of apho 
risms or proverbs or practical maxims which refer 



 introduction 

to the same subject though this falls short of 
logic there may be order and therefore method 
where there is uttle knowledge and no conse 
quentiality crabbe with his usual truth and 
usual bitterness has observed of misers heralds 
flowerfanciers and one or two other respectable 
rather than usefiil classes of men that 

order to these is armour and defence 
and love of method serves in lack of sense • 

to be methodical is useful both to the professor 
of knowledge and to him who would acquire it 
but it is perfectly compatible both with ignorance 
in the one and apathy in the other 

before then entering directly on our subject a 
few words may be said both on the use and abuse 
of methodology some degree of method is ne 
cessary in every stage above the merest empiricism 
without it we could only observe detached facts 
we could not couple them by any mental asso 
ciation unite them indissolubly and extract a 
principle from them we use an inartificial 
method in the ordinary process of gaining know 
ledge by observation and retaining it as this 
process becomes more elaborate we require a 
more elaborate apparatus for our aid our system 
must expand together with that which we sys 
tematize 

but this it may be said proves only the im 
portance of method not of studying it an

introduction 



eminent naturalist once insisted on the utility of 
chemistry because sulphur for instance was a 
constituent substance of the body and chemistry 
taught the nature and properties of sulphur the 
answer was obvious — that however important 
the element might be it was not therefore of 
equal importance to be aware of its existence 
though the sulphur was usefiil it did not follow 
that the knowledge of its utility was useful know 
ledge in hke manner it may be argued method 
is indispensable but not therefore the study of 
method 

and further it is a common remark that ordi 
nary systems of procedure are despised by those 
minds which bear the impress of genius they 
travel a way of their own and their justification 
lies in their success if they exhibit the perfec 
tion of method it is unconsciously conformity 
to rule would only have cramped them their 
greatness depended on their perfect freedom from 
restraint 

allowing this to be true which it is not in the 
sense in which it is often taken the study of 
method may yet be abundantly usefiil granting 
that it is not of service to the greatest of men it 
will quite suflsce if it profits all below them the 
result of their spontaneous and almost unconscious 
energies we must be content to attain by the aid 
of rule others on system aim at that which they 
attain unsystematically their very superiority 



 introduction 

makes their instinct our model with the earnest 
minded to admire is to imitate and surely it is 
better to attain the height of excellence which we 
admire though by a different road than in a vain 
mimicry of the process to fail of the result alto 
gether 

the study of method then has its use it is also 
liable to abuse its office is to enable us to 
arrange and combine facts not to enable us to 
dispense with them yet it may be and has been 
thus perverted if knowledge and observation 
and experiment are observed to go forther with 
method than without them men may fall into the 
misconception that it can supersede them to so 
great a degree as to render them comparatively 
unimportant when possessed with this idea 
they endeavour to employ form as the staple of 
their enquiries to the neglect of matter such it 
will be presently seen was the great error of the 
schoolmen they saw a possibility which they 
vainly endeavoured to realize it may be possible 
that from the perfect analysis of a truth all other 
truths may be inferred it is highly impossible that 
any one will ever be able to perfect the analysis 
and effect the inference 

but it would be premature to dwell at present 
on the scholastic abuse of method it will be 
more to our purpose to mention some of its evil 
results in a form with which we are more familiar 
for in an undue exaltation of methodology lies 



introduction 

the intellectual error of those with whom specula 
tion and agitation of wit stand in the place of 
learning who are content with nothing short of 
system and desire nothing more who make con 
sistency the one test of truth or if they avoid the 
mistake of confoimding what is with what might 
have been neglect the actual in the vain quest of 
the ideal who devote themselves in short to that 
idle and not very innocent employment of forming 
in philosophy and religion and civil govern 
ment imaginary models of a world and schemes 
of governing it 

there is then great danger in the exclusive 
study of method the mere collector of facts 
which he cannot arrange and has no real notion 
of using cannot do much harm to himself or 
others if his labours are on a great scale he 
becomes a helot of literature toiling that others 
may enjoy in a smaller field he terminates for 
the most part as a dealer in illsorted anecdotes 
and illdigested propositions while in matters of 
importance he follows passively in the wake of 
others who govern him by the possession of a 
little more tact and judgment he has knowledge 
in some sense without information 

but he who unprovided with facts and without 
the intention of acquiring them enters on the 
study of methodology has no such immunity from 
danger from a small foundation he hopes to 
proceed to great and extensive knowledge re 



 introduction 

search is not his occupation but the exercise of his 
ingenuity on some few first principles which 
recommend themselves to his own mind or are 
taken on trust from those whom he admires or it 
may be have real external evidence in their 
favour he fastens hid belief but these lie far 
apart from this commonlife world and the domain 
of ordinary practice for the connection between 
them he depends on certain slender intellectual 
threads spun out spiderlike from within that 
which he thus invents he believes but this beuef 
rests not on objective truth or on the evidence of 
his fellowcreatures or on god but on himself 
unbelief sits at the right hand of such a faith a 
selfmade damocles he sees the sword of scep 
ticism suspended over him by a hair if events 
do not fall out as he expects if phenomena will 
not harmonize with his system if truth in some 
painfiil and oppressive form thrusts itself upon 
him he becomes convinced though against his 
will that things are not as they seemed to him 
he deserts his system and what has he left 
nothing but the ruins of a building which had no 
foundation the material of those thin walls built 
upon the sand which one blast of gods breath could 
overthrow mere love of method is selfworship 
and nothing more the overthrow of the idol is 
the best fate which we can wish to the idolater 

the true student of method is in an entirely 
different intellectual position he will labour 



introduction 

to preserve the analogy of truth — to keep the 
world within in harmony with the world with 
out method itself will not be his ultimate object 
but some other branch of enquiry to which he 
applies his method and which it is meant to 
further 

those who have really forwarded formal 
science have been men of general science also 
plato that greatest of merely human names was 
no unpractical dreamer on abstractions but did 
every thing well that he attempted from writing 
greek to wrestling aristotle was the most learned 
of men the best of the schoolmen were familiar 
with courts and toiled in councils while they 
methodized lord bacon had an eye for facts of 
almost preternatural acuteness descartes not 
only wrote de methodo and wandered at large in 
metaphysics but was a mathematician an anatomist 
and almost in his way a divine 

the dry metaphysician is the most useless of all 
beings he handles truths of which he does not 
know the preciousness when he has once map 
ped out the country he would be unconcerned if it 
should sink under water a reasoning self 
sufficing thing he suffices for nothing but himself 
he is the usiuer of intellect and the miser 

method is as the name indicates a way in 
quest of something it is intended to forward re 
search not to be itself an object he is sure to fall 
short of his mark who erects a means into an end 



 introduction 

let us now proceed before insisting on the true 
relation of logic to science to consider the views 
which have been previously entertained on the 
subject and to show how the thinkers of ancient 
and raediaeval times handed on the torch to their 
successors

the ancient view of the relation of logic 

to science 

in considering the relation which according to 
the ancient and mediaeval philosophies respectively 
logic bore to science it would be unwise to take 
any very restricted notion of logic itself by which 
to limit our enquiries and test the opinions of 
those who have preceded us we must not look 
for greater accuracy in the use of our terms than 
was possible in the time of their early application 
we shall see more fiilly the bearings of our 
subject by taking logic in its widest sense not 
enforcing our distinctions on those who could 
never have heard of them but content as is often 
best at the opening of an investigation to follow 
the guidance of a name and see whither it will 
lead us so we may be sure that wherever we 
find the word logic we are on our proper ground 
in whatever sense our authorities used it whether 
they meant by it an art or a science whether they 
assigned to it as its province language or in 
ference or thought in general 

and if as can scarcely be doubted logic is to 



 the ancient view op the 

be considered rather an art than a science this 
alone would justify us in using the term somewhat 
vaguely science is as we shall hereafter see the 
development of an idea and the definiteness of 
this idea is a condition of the progress of the 
science not so with art which deals rather with 
phoenomena than with ideas which aims at effecting 
an end not at exploring a certain sphere of know 
ledge arts contract and expand almost inde 
finitely the bold projector widens their field 
in theory the skilfiil artificer enlarges them in 
practice on the other hand the division of 
labour often splits one art into several and limits 
to a part the application of a name which once 
extended to the whole or the advance of know 
ledge shows perhaps that it has attempted more 
than it could well fulfil and leads it to modify its 
pretensions or some change in the circumstances 
of social life causes it to fall into neglect and 
desuetude so that the history of an art like that 
of a kingdom is to a great extent the history of its 
boundaries the capital remains unchanged but 
the extent of territory around it varies we all 
know what is meant by the art of medicine yet 
how little remains fixed in it when examined at 
first we have a scanty knowledge of simples and 
some empirical rules as to diet then the mineral 
kingdom comes in to lend its aid to the vegetable 
afterwards we find the art taking another turn 
and not content with bare observation deducing 



relation of logic to science 

rules from guesses as to the nature of remedies in 
general some fanciful doctrine of signatures for 
instance or a premature theory of vital action 
then a better acquaintance with the laws of 
physiology and chemistry comes to its aid we 
must not forget its shifting and uncertain sym 
pathies with other real or pretended systems — with 
alchemy or astrology or magnetism yet how 
small a part of this array of subjects comes under 
the notice of the ordinary practitioner to enquire 
into the history of medicine confining ourselves to 
our own views of its nature and province would 
lead us to rob the ancients without enriching the 
modems and make one of the oldest of the arts 
comparatively a creature of the day 

what place then did logic taken in its broadest 
sense occupy in the systems of the philosophers of 
greece 

philosophy was in existence some time before 
logic arose by her side the ionian and pytha 
gorean schools had no logic it is not hard to see 
the reason of this the two schools have this point 
of resemblance that the teaching of each was 
homogeneous they attempted no division of phi 
losophy the systems of the one were based 
wholly on physical considerations of the other 
wholly on metaphysical and they had the whole 
world before them their enquiries assumed the 
form of curiosity they speculated without doubt 
and concluded without hesitation men do not 



 the ancient view of the 

seek a canon of truth till they feel the danger of 
falling into error thales and pythagoras had no 
such misgiving they argued and dogmatized with 
out fear of contradiction and were received with 
an applause that bore witness to their success 
they were too sanguine to need a logic 

the eleatics who were the first doubters first 
showed symptoms of a logical turn they wit 
nessed the failure of the ionian and pythagorean 
systems when xenophanes lived and philoso 
phized water and chaos had each been advocated 
as the principle of all things by the time of em 
pedocles fire and air had each hkewise aspired to 
universal rule and failed the pythagorean theory 
of numbers had met with no better success the 
eleatics only half discouraged by these repeated 
misadventures of others formed a new scheme of 
their own we owe to them one of the funda 
mental antitheses of philosophy that of sense and 
reason unhappily they made this nice distinction 
the occasion of an error and in distinguishing 
opposed them they taught not that reason and 
sense were conversant with the different poles of 
truth but that the one was the source of truth the 
other of falsehood thus they introduced a vicious 
dualism into their philosophy in the form of an 
antithesis between the cognizable and the sensible 
the ideal and the actual world 

these opinions of theirs introduced a new division 
into philosophy to physic taken in its widest 



relation of logic to sciencf 

sense as including metaphysic they added logic 
the new feature developed itself by degrees em 
pedocles had a leaning towards dialectic which is 
indicated by his inventing rhetoric — an honour 
which aristotle ascribes to him nor was par 
menides ignorant of this branch of thought zeno 
enjoys the distinction of being styled the inventor 
of logic by aristotle himself and now philo 
sophy displayed clearly the two divisions of logic 
and physic 

ethic had hitherto held quite a subordinate 
place it came in as a corollary attached to other 
conclusions and had no distinct principles of its 
own the ethical opinions of those old philoso 
phers followed naturally from their physical thus 
clemens alexandrinus informs us that heraclitus 
the tendency of whose whole philosophy was to 
annihilate the individual very consistently made 
the chief good consist in content which is the 
submission of the individual mind to the universal 
while pythagoras mathematical to the last placed 
happiness in the knowledge of the perfection of 
the numbers of the soul and anaxagoras who

 the ancient view of the 

held as his physical theory that the primitiye 
chaos had been informed and shaped by intellect 
found the end of life in contemplation and the 
freedom resulting therefrom v detached opinions 
such as these are all we can expect to find 
scarcely a ray of moral light descends from the 
abstract and metaphysical theology of xenophanes 
empedocles cannot claim the title of an ethical 
teacher we must seek in his physical philosophy 
the reasons of such tenets as the unlawfulness of 
depriving animals of life love and hate so 
naturally principles of action are with him hat 
elements of a physical theory where they are seen 
not movmg men but forming a world there was 
no independent ethical teaching before the time 
of socrates 

the glorious mind of plato so sympathetic with 
the thoughts of all he loved and honoured xa yet 
so comprehisive of all truth while it attached all 
due importance to the socratic doctrines did not 
venture to neglect the labours of the past the

ethic of socrates was retained by him but not in 
its isolation endeavoiuring to transfer to his 
master the praise which was justly his own he put 
him forward as the discoverer of the triple aspect 
of philosophy and socrates undoubtedly had 
considerable pretensions as a logician his view of 
method so far as we can trace it was admirable 
and he so systematized definition and induction as 
to have been deemed their inventor but his occa 
sional speculations on the nature of the world and 
the soul will not entitle him to the name of a 
physical philosopher nor granting their fullest 
value to his researches can we therefore fairly 
assume his acquaintance with the scheme which 
under his pupils hands they illustrated it is to 
the systematic plato that we really owe the division 
of philosophy since so widely accepted into ethic 
physic and logic 

no groundplan of philosophy among the 
ancients gained so wide a ciurency as this aris 
totle though he did not employ it as his scientific

 the ancient view of the 

division yet in practice adopts it epicurus 
recognised it also though he gave to the logical 
section the name of canonic the stoics 
accepted it without any such alteration of termi 
nology so generally admitted was it that it was 
forced in some sense by popular opinion on those 
who would not otherwise acknowledge it sects 
which denied its validity or were ignorant of its 
existence were tried by its standard thus we 
are informed of which more hereafter that the 
cynics confined their attention to ethic and 
neglected physic and logic 

it is to our purpose to see what prominence 
what place and office the different schools assigned 
to the logical limb of this division a few pre 
paratory remarks will enable us the better to see 
the real nature of the question on which they

very reason more strikingly illustrative of the prevalence of this 
division is the statement of philo judsbus quod omnis probus 
liber that ihe essenes cultivated ethic to the exclusion of logic 
and far the greater portion of physic it is startling to find 
st jerome applying it to holy scripture in the following passage 
 quomodo philosophi solent disputationes suas in physicam

evangeliis epist ad paulum urbicura de interpretatione al

relation of logic to science 

parted company and the reasons which rendered 
it incapable of a satisfactory solution 

the ancients used the term logic in a much 
wider sense than we do as physical philosophy 
included all the phenomena of the outward world 
and if we can allow a soul to brutes those of the 
 irrational soul also as ethic considered all 
questions of directly practical import so the whole 
world of mind came under logic it dealt with 
mental laws whether these laws were considered 
as the means of investigation or its object if 
the application of reasoning could solve a ques 
tion without appeal to observation or experiment 
its solution belonged to this branch of philosophy 
if the nature of the rational soul was considered 
logic claimed it as its province if a system of 
rules was to be constructed fitted to aid in the 
ordinary investigation of truth here too logic was 
at home 

the word then was taken in too broad a sense 
to be distinct in its meaning metaphysic or the 
science of thought as belonging to the rational 
soul in the first place fell within it then it 
included logic proper or the system of rules for 
reasoning grounded on the laws of thought lastly 
it included logic applied — the concrete of these 
rules and the matter of any particular question 
which they enabled the enquirer to determine 

the clear mind of aristotle did not fail to 
discern this equivocation he saw the difference 



 the ancient view of the 

between the metaphysical truths on which the 
rules of reasoning are grounded and the rules of 
reasoning themselves his usage of language on 
this point is not however that to which we are now 
accustomed logic is with him the more general 
term analytic the more restricted our logic 
corresponds to the latter rather than to the former 
thus on the one hand he calls it a logical ques 
tion whether there be one science of contraries 
or not on the other hand he describes rhetoric 
which we should characterize as the union of the 
science of human nature and logic as a com 
bination of politic and analytic the opposition 
therefore between logical and analytical in his 
mind would answer to that between metaphysical 
and logical in ours there is of course nothing 
implied in this antithesis which could hinder him 
from viewing logic generical including analytic 
and much more as one great section of philosophy 
in contrast both with ethic and physic 

plato on the other hand it is well known 
courted of set purpose the fusion of these two 
ideas — of the law and the rule of thought of the 
basis on which logic is built and the logical 
building itself though a variety of authorities 
attribute to him the threefold division of philosophy 
he does not himself explicitly state it and dia 
lectic rather than logic is the name by which he

distinguishes the third number of the division we 
know too that his making those universals which 
were generally regarded as the creatures of logic 
real existences and identifying them with his 
ideas led him to include mider one name the 
formal and the real science his dialectic was 
not a mere intellectual discipline or a bare organon 
of truth but a summary of the highest and in 
some sense the only real knowledge 

it will be seen then that these two great 
authorities however much they differ on other 
points agree in one they both exalt logic 
above physic and ethic platos reason was 
obvious dialectic was the one great science to 
which in his opinion other sciences owed not 
only their apparatus but their very aim and 
purpose and aristotle taking as we have seen 
logic in its broadest sense made it include far too 
much to be at all tempted to underrate it 

the two great schools which succeeded in greek

but as two schools of philosophy arose before 
logic had its origin so also two which were 
almost contemporaneous with its most flourishing 
ays shut their eyes and refused to acknowledge 
it one of these was that of the cynics we 
have seen above that the rejection of logic was 
formerly laid to their charge the accusation 
which is so directly made might have been inferred 
from their known opinions antisthenes and his 
disciples denied the possibility of definition and 
of contradiction the one position is incon 
sistent with a belief in the accuracy of knowledge 
the other even denies that it is attainable for 
if there be no contradiction there can be no 
antithesis between truth and falsehood if there 
be no definition truth may exist indeed but with 
such indistinctness and uncertainty of outline as 
to defy a sure recognition in each opinion the 
same tone of mind appears to regard truth as 
something which the mind cannot really grasp is 
a long stage on the road towards disbelieving its 
existence 

the cynics indeed seem to have been a pitiable 
sect of philosophers — pitiable too perhaps in the 
sense of deserving our pity first of all they turned 
their thoughts to virtue which they thought both 
attainable and necessary on the ethical branch of 
philosophy they therefore cast no slight but this 
absorbed their whole attention on the cold un

impassioned countenance of their ideal virtue they 
fixed their eyes and forgot all besides the laws 
of the souls and the phenomena of nature they 
alike despised beyond virtue all seemed un 
certain the sophists had overthrown their faith 
iti human knowledge and herachtus had sapped 
their trust in the outer world plato invented his 
theory of ideas that by reposing all that was 
precious upon them he might preserve the con 
fidence of men both in knowledge and goodness 
the cynics thought that their doctrine of im 
passibihty saved virtue from the general crash and 
calmly allowed the sea of doubt to sweep all else 
away 

very unlike paths lead different men to the same 
conclusions the cyrenaics also were said to 
resolve all philosophy into ethic aristotle him

theory was needed to justify ease and selfindulgence 
to those who loved them 

as time passed on the schools which at first 
occupied independent ground came into contact 
questions originated by each separately were 
discussed in common and we find at a period 
long after the inventors of the respective systems 
had ceased to write and live their descendants 
once more discussing points which seemed to have 
been settled and ruling them anew 

in the time of ammoniusthe stoics peripatetics 
and platonists had long he tells us held their 
distinct view as to the relation of logic to philo

made it a part of philosophy one of theur argur 
ments is sufficiently terse and concise to deserve 
mention no art they said made its own instru 
ment logic therefore which is the creation of 
philosophy is not its instrument but a part of it 
the title of aristotles logical works was the watch 
word of the peripatetics who held logic to be only 
an instrument the argument which ammonius 
puts in their mouth has certainly a tinge of a phi 
losophy foreign to that of their master they 
argued he tells us that every part must have the 
same matter and the same end with the whole 
but there was no such identity of subject and pur 
pose in logic and philosophy for philosophy

they proceeded had things for its matter and 
assimilation to god for its end while the subject 
of logic was language and its aid demonstration 
the conclusion at which they arrived was true 
the way of attaining it if it was really theirs proves 
how the school of aristotle had degenerated in 
those bad times 

the platonic view we are informed by the same 
authority was that logic was both a part and an 
instrument of philosophy these piatonists too 
argued rather childishly a hand they urged by 
way of example is an instrument of giving and 
taking a part of the whole body of course there 
is nothing wonderful in the same things being 
a part of one thing and an instrument of another 
there is something more philosophical in a dis 
tinction which they drew with a like object between 
logic when viewed as an independent system of 
rules and when actually applied to some particular 
subject regarded abstractedly as in the former 
case it seemed to them an instrument of philo 
sophy taken in the concrete as in the latter case 
it became a part thus while they sided theo 
retically with the stoics their mode of expression 
tended practically to that concision of logic and 
science which afterwards prevailed among the 
schoolmen 

thus much of the views which the principal 
schools of ancient philosophy held regarding 
logic their want of distinctness and consistency 



 the ancient view of the 

is obvious the reason of this deficiency has been 
hinted at more than once falling short of a 
definite conception of logic itself they could 
attain no distinct statement of its relation to other 
subjects human reason at large and reasoning 
or the exercise of the inferential faculty par 
ticularly and language in which reason finds its 
expression may all be investigated like any other 
subject and therefore brought under one or more 
sciences such science or sciences would of course 
be a part of philosophy and the greeks employ 
ing a single word to express at once thought and 
language would naturally call such a science 

this combination then of metaphysic and uni 
versal grammar though scarcely deserving to give 
a name to the most important division of philo 
sophy would nevertheless rank under it aristotle 
and plato were right in insisting on its claim to 
this honour the stoics and epicureans trod on 
the verge of error when they lowered the laws of 
thought in their esteem to the level of the rules 
which are grounded on them and the cynics and 
cyrenaics were undoubtedly wrong when they 
despised this branch of knowledge altogether 

but logic in the sense which we give to the 
term is not a science but an art not directly 
adding to our stock of abstract truths but serving 
to extend in all directions the domain of general 
knowledge it is not a part of philosophy but the

organon of philosophy at large and it was to 
logic proper as an art that the enquiries of the 
later schools which have been mentioned above 
referred the peripatetic position that it is an 
instrument is in this way perfectly correct it 
was an anticipation of the modem idea of the 
subject and was only too early to bear fruit the 
platonic statement has the air of a verbal com 
promise but agrees essentially with the peri 
patetic the stoical opinion is indefensible that 
school held fast to its ancient dogma without 
understanding it though it might be rash to 
assert with hooker that they accounted stupidity 
the highest top of wisdom y they certainly showed 
for the most part more obstinacy in retaining a 
position than skill in defending it 

the view of the later peripatetics we have said 
was alone correct but it was planted among the 
fragments of a ruined philosophy and failed to 
take root the ancients on the whole sub 
scribed to the formula that logic is a part of 
philosophy turn we now to the schoolmen 
and see how through their researches we have 
journeyed by a tortuous road to truth

the stream of knowledge though it always 
flows never flows evenly for long together it 
often seems to divide and its portions to take dif 
ferent courses but the separation is seldom final 
the severed streamlets form an island beyond 
which they unite the smaller body of water 
flows perhaps straight onward through a confined 
and artificial channel the main stream makes a 
longer circuit but both join at last 

we may apply our metaphor and say that 
ancient philosophy ran in a comparatively narrow 
course after aristotle the late peripatetics we 
have seen kept and carried on with regard to 
logic the true doctrine of their master but 
thilosophy in general took a different turn ari 
stotle himself and not the opinions of his school 
after him formed the text which exercised the 
commentatorial spirit of the middle ages the

high in dignity and perfection nor were the

these words to a great degree explain themselves 
of the latter however we should observe that it 
took a much wider range with aristotle than with 
us including to a great extent the laws of mind 
as well as of matter — the laws of all phenomena in

philosophy it belongs to train men to the love of 
goodness and the perception of beauty but when 
art and education have not only brought forth 
fruit in practice but have also developed character 
and elicited ideas which had else lain dormant in 
the mind wisdom can then without loss of caste 
regard them she adds to her contemplation of 
absolute being and in subordination to this of 
the laws which move the framework of the uni 
verse a knowledge of those principles also on which 
depend the good and the beautifril 

such was aristotles wisdom perfect in its 
subject which is coextensive with law and order 
perfect in its method which is that of the cre 
ative mind starting with the simple idea of being 
and descending thence in regular sequence through 
the whole array of including and included universals 
perfect in the nature of its contemplation which 
sums up in a single term the whole series of 
causation and grasps by a simple intellectual act 
what has been called the mundane idea or the 
summary law of nature

the schoolmen found the design and thought it 
too striking to be neglected their theological 
stores were a large addition to the material be 
queathed by aristotle so with full confidence 
in their resources and a perpetual reference to the 
original sketch before them they attempted to 
rear the temple of universal knowledge where 
aristotle had laid the foundation they built his 
facts ready hewn to their hands they incorporated 
with the building his metaphysic supplied them

term is vague enough can it be otherwise when 
we sum up under the title of scholastic philosophy 
the whole mass of thought vast in its extent if not 
in its value which occupied the minds of the 
learned in its elaboration between the tenth and 
the sixteenth centuries if it brings up any image 
at all before most minds it is a very incongruous 
one in which john scotus and dun scotus are in 
danger of losing their individuality roscelin and 
ockham the nominalists early and late blend 
confiisedly together and anselm and lanfranc 
come into contact with albertus magnus and 
thomas aquinas we are apt to think that during 
the long period of scholastic dominion there was 
no true growth and progress that books increased 
beyond number and writer superseded writer with 
out any corresponding not to say proportionate 
increase of knowledge or revolution of opinion 
but that aristotle was a nucleus round which hard 
words innumerable attached themselves by accre 
tion like so much inorganic matter but such a 
tone of thought is an unnecessary wrong to an 
extinct philosophy its unity of form though 
by no means so great as is generally supposed 
serves nevertheless to disguise from the care 
less observer very wide differences in substance 
the opinion that the thinkers of those days 
must have been all very much uke each other 
is too rapid an inference from the undoubted 
fact that they were all ver unlike ourselves if

we identify as is usual the scholastic and me 
diaeval philosophy we must not forget that 
there were as truly within it subordinate schools 
as there had been in ancient and are in modem 
times in spite of the greater resemblance of form 
which they acquired as treating all subjects in a 
single view and in a conventional language they 
expanded with difficulty and often with danger 
to their advocates under the watchful eye and 
stern admonition of churchauthority 

the great point of similarity among the school 
men is indeed that feature of their writings with 
which we are most concerned — the uniform pre 
sence of a dialectical spirit some of the traits 
which we should be most apt at first to select as 
characteristic are by no means universally present 
their devotion to aristotle for instance is not 
invariable the master of sentences himself peter 
lombard has been observed never to quote him 
and with several of the early schoolmen the neo 
platonic element preponderates over the peripa 
tetic the commentatorial spirit again prevailed 
not so generally among them as it is said to do 
now among the literati of china it does not 
distinguish for instance the scholastic works of 
st anselm and the masterpieces of school 
labour the book of sentences and the sums of 
theology are in the form of questions and distinc

a single important question — the relation of logic 
to science though were we attempting a portrait 
of the perfect schoolman we should still do best 
to refer to him he is in many ways the best 
specimen of his class he wrote at the time when 
the schoolphilosophy seemed to have completely 
recovered from the attack which threatened it with 
destruction in its infancy and which ockham 
afterwards renewed to its ultimate downfal he 
unites in himself to a remarkable degree the theo 
logical and philosophical traditions of former days 
augustine was his acknowledged authority in 
matters of religion and averroes to an extent of 
which he was not himself aware his leader in the 
interpretation of aristotle the earlier schoolmen 
wrote in fear often wellgrounded of the inter 
ference of the church the later are thought to 
have pressed the system to its utmost boundaries 
and to have seen glimpses of the coming reform 
ation aquinas more than any of his fellow 
labourers was fortunate in the reception of his 
speculations they were never deemed of unlawful 
tendency and gained for him the rare praise of 
uniting orthodoxy and philosophical acuteness 
we may add that his writings at the present day 
are still spoken of if not consulted and referred 
to if not read and alone of all the scholastic 
volumes show traces of a dubious vitality 

it will then be worth while keeping thomas 
aquinas steadily before us as the type of the

scholastic philosophy to show briefly from his 
writings the place which logical method held in 
his system our position be it remembered is 
this — that the schoolmen took their ideal of

the affirmative at the very opening of his great 
work he declares that the sacred doctrine is one

cal transcending all other sciences whatsoever 
in a word absolutely and simply wisdom v 

the christian theology then would according 
to aquinas approach very nearly in the terms of 
its definition to that of the heathen philosopher 
this would indeed still leave room for a very wide 
distinction between them but it would lead us 
to expect at least thus much that the schoolmen 
would be very careful in drawing a line of de 
marcation between the divine wisdom and aris 
totles crowning virtue this however is not the 
case thus in his comment on aristotles meta 
physics he begins by assigning to his authors first 
science the very title by which he distinguishes 
his own it bears he tells us the three names of 
the divine science or theology metaphysic and 
the first philosophy and how thoroughly he 
blends in his method of treatment the human and 
the divine wisdom how he considers them to con

so the philosopher determines that the first

of any truth but of that which is the origin of ajl

further proof cannot be necessary of the close 
connection not to say identity which thomas 
aquinas held to exist between aristotles first 
philosophy and the christian theology we 
must next show the importance he attached to 
the principles of the aristotelian metaphysic 

though aristotle and the schoolmen each 
founded their great science on the same idea that 
of being it by no means necessarily followed that 
their respective sciences should be identical they 
need not ever have been to any great extent 
similar the conceptions which they employed 
to express and bring out at length the meaning 
and force of that idea might have been entirely 
different they might have endeavoured to por 
tion out the world of thought on some novel 
principle and have spent their chief labouir in 
discovering a range of metaphysical abstractions 
which should give their speculation an individual

among the ancients others preferred an inter

the conception which lies midway between the

these different opinions himself subscribes to a

which blends them all and asserts that the 
categories have to do with words which signify 
things through the medium of conceptions 

the schoolmen would have adopted this view 
had they exclusively followed tradition it is 
contained in their principal authority on the 
subject a commentary on the ten predicaments 
erroneously attributed by them to st augustine 
but they rejected as superficial and insufficient 
the belief that the categories were mainly a

science would be at once possible under such 
a classification every thing might be duly ranked 
and ordered and a natural system so to speak of 
the whole universe be constructed and this was 
the work which the schoolmen thought they had 
the power to accomplish the categories them 
selves indeed do not hold a very prominent place 
in their general writings like other abstract 
principles when once enunciated and clearly laid 
down as true they are traceable mainly in their 
consequences they stand like so many land 
marks seen from a distance indeed but of most 
continual use in guiding the mind to its decision on 
questions which are very remotely and indirectly 
connected with them the bearings of truths 
derived firom very different sources from holy 
writ and the writings of the fathers were deter 
mined by them this was a great misfortune to 
the schoolmen that they never suspected the 
existence of any discrepancy in their heterogeneous 
material or at least if the suspicion unavoidably 
occurred never ventured to entertain it theo 
logians at the first they began in the school of 
faith and carried their belief too far inspiration 
itself could not receive more reverence than aris

word they shut their eyes to the real state of things 
and look about for some other explanation thus

aquinas wishes to persuade himself that the philo 
sopher did not actually hold the world to be eternal 
but was rather like a subtle disputant of his own 
times urging in a dialectical spirit plausible argu 
ments against the position of an adversary the 
schoolmen had never heard of destroying with a 
view to reconstruct unhappy in the absence of 
doubt they fell short of the philosophic mind in 
one respect at least — that they never learned to 
reject 

logic then as the schoolmen thought had a 
noble task before it with so much inherited from 
their predecessors all new appeal to the world of 
observation seemed on their part superfluous 
from certain given truths they hoped by a long 
circumduction to infer all truth for this purpose 
logical instruments were to suffice but the in 
struments of logic differ from those of most other 
arts in a very marked manner there is in art 
generally little similarity between the tool and that 
on which it operates and further most arts 
confine themselves in practice strictly to singulars 
the sculptor applies an individual tool to an indi 
vidual block of marble it is a given portion of a

so thought the schoolmen— and to a great 
measure rightly how then were they to discri 
minate where there seemed so much risk of con 
fusion between their method and that on which 
they employed it the conceptions whether of 
things or classes which their enquiries presupposed 
and the apparatus of logic itself were alike modes 
of intellect without some especial provision 
error and perplexity must ensue from their running 
into each other this danger was obviated by 
drawing a distinction between first and second 
intentions a first intention v they taught was 
the likeness of something existing external to the 
mind as for instance the conception which follows 
on hearing the word man — a conception which is 
founded immediately on the thing whereas a 
second intention is not a likeness of any thing 
existing external to the mind but a conception 
following on our mode of understanding such 
things these are invented by the intellect itself 
as for instance the conception which is signified by 
the word genus intentions of this kind have their 
immediate foundation not in the things but in the 
understanding though the remote foundation is in 
the thing itself so that to express the same

not of things but of words nouns of the first 
intention axe those which are imposed upon things

which the mind is carried immediately to the thing

the light of the natural classification the first 
intentions were related to each other in other

before taking our farewell of the scholastic view 
of logic it is natural to make some remarks on the 
great question as to the nature of universals which 
connected itself so closely with it though the 
battle has long been fought there is a great 
historical charm and even some living interest 
associated with the onceprominent partynames of 
nominalist and realist 

we may easily see the reason of the importance 
attached to this question and the zeal with which 
it was contested logic we have said was in fact 
the sum of scholastic science and this great 
science professed to deal with universals on these 
depended the whole array of questions and ob 
jections consequences and conclusions their 
modality so to speak determined that of the 
whole system and those who were not too 
busily engaged in adding to it and elaborating it 
to find time for looking back and seeing what had 
been accomplished and on what foundation it 
rested naturally came at last to the enquiry what 
these universals were 



nominalism and bealism 

of course the originators of this question among 
the schoolmen were neither the first to ask it nor 
the last plato aristotle and the stoics not to 
mention other authorities had each their distinctive 
theory of universals none of these were entirely 
satisfactory and modern philosophy feels the old 
difficulty to be still unsolved to be lying at the 
basis pf ahnost every important doubt and to 
present the great check to its rapid and confident 
progress in all probability indeed a compa 
ratively ancient source suggested the enquiry to 
the schoolmen porphyry in his treatise on the 
predicables states the problem though he decunes 
attempting to solve it whether he says 
 genus and species are substances or exist in 
bare thought alone or supposing them to be 
substances whether they are material or im 
material and again whether they exist separately 
or in composition with sensible objects i must 
decline discussing the subject is profound and 
needs a separate and more detailed enquiry its 
due quantity of enquiry at least in aftertimes it 
gained 

it is well known that europe derived its know 
ledge of aristotle from the arabians and that 
among these their principal authority averroes 
tinctured the peripatetic philosophy with a strong 
spice of a spurious neoplatonism under his 
hands the doctrine of universals assumed a form

 nominalism and realism 

 

something like that of ideas genus and species 
were held to be substances not mere attributes 
much less words whether they existed abstract 
edly from matter or were rather to be described 
as always present in the concrete was a subject 
left for afterdiscussion the theory of averroes 
himself was in fact an illdisguised pantheism 
which when applied to certain subjects led to 
results which so displeased the schoolmen as to 
prevent even when such objections did not occur 
its formal and exphcit reception here their 
theology came in as a safeguard to their philo 
sophy they shrank as christians from the view 
which he held that one common human intellect 
existed of which each individual intellect was 
a part but they followed him so far as to 
conceive that the universal was an actual thing 
and thus before nominalism was heard of realism 
or a beuef in the existence of universals as sub 
stances and not merely as attributes of the mind 
of man was the current belief of the early school 
men and their immediate predecessors it suited 
the feelings of those who like scotus erigena 

 a view thomas aquinas argued justly opusc xvi conlra 
averroistas which is repugnant to the truth of the christian 
faith for intellect appears to be alone of all the parts of the 
soul incorruptible and immortal now supposing diversity of 
intellect to be removed from all men it follows that after death 
nothing of human souls would remain except their intellectual 
unity and thus all retribution of reward and punishment would be 
removed 



nominalism and realism 

were mystically inclined it could not be dis 
agreeable to those argumentative spirits who were 
anxious to maintain the honour of dialectic but 
though thus in possession of the scholastic mind at 
the first it did not establish its supremacy without 
a struggle the nominalist attack showed at 
once its strength and its weakness it called forth 
the hidden strength of realism by proving that it 
was entwined with the very roots of the school 
philosophy which could not ultimately but stand 
or fall with it it also betrayed its weakness by 
showing that it lacked the distinctness of a true 
and consistent theory and assumed very different 
shapes in the minds of its different supporters 

the history of nominalism divides itself into 
two very marked periods during the former of 
these it was forcing by its attacks the scholastic 
philosophy to assume a more definite form than it 
had hitherto taken and was so hurrying on its own 
temporary defeat during the latter it was sapping 
the strength of that mighty system by introducing 
into its inmost heart an element of doubt in 
both periods it connected itself with theological 
questions in feeling and tendency if not by the 
links of strict consequence nominalism has often 
been called and justly the precursor of the 
reformation and as those who first afmed unsuc 
cessftiuy at a reformation were more violent in 
their opinions than those who took up the work 
afterwards and succeeded so the earlier nomi

nalists doomed from the first to fail were more 
extravagant and far less philosophical in their 
teaching than the happier band whom ockham 
led on to victory 

rosceun of compeigne was confessedly the 
founder of the sect of the nominalists the term 
at first was meant to indicate that its adherents 
bestowed their attention on language and held 
universals to consist in names though it was 
natural that the realists should endeavour to give 
it still fiuther force in applying it as an allusion to 
what they thought the merely verbal knowledge of 
their antagonists and so aventinus even when 
looking back upon the past explains it roscelin 
he says the founder of the new lyceum first 
cultivated the science of words and phrases and 
discovered a new way of philosophizing to him 
we owe it that the peripatetics or followers of 
aristotle divided mto two classes — the older rich 
in invention and claiming for itself the science of 
things and therefore called the real school and 
the later disturbers of this science and called 
nominalists because niggardly of things but 
prodigal of names and notions they appear to be 
the partisans of words this is neither a very

little to be trusted who can confute a sneer and praise on 
like grounds is equally deceptive luther commends the later

profound nor a very fair account of nominalism 
in general but it serves to show the feelings 
with which its advocates were regarded down to a 
comparatively late date as sceptics who would 
lower the dignity of dialectic curtail the region of 
science and siick out the very marrow of philo 
sophy 

roscelin himself indeed appears to have de 
served the name of nominalist in its fullest and 
most unfavourable signification he advocated 
the position that universals were nothing but 
names — a position which as we shall see here 
after has little to be said in its fevour and if 
consistently maintained is fatal to all true phuo 
sophy the error did not remain unrebuked for 
he drew upon himself the powerfiil opposition of

dialectician had another hold upon his adversary

own life in which he displays no disposition to 
reserve but perhaps a reason for the omission 
may be found in his circumstances he had

himself to bear the imputation of heterodoxy and 
would naturally shrink from the weight of obloquy 
which attached to another indeed he goes out 
of his way to condemn in strong terms both the 
logic and the theology of roscelin there was 
the more need for caution here because thdir 
opinions might by the careless or unskilful be 
confounded for abelard though not in the 
strictest sense of the word a nominalist was at 
least an antireahst john of salisbury thus 
records the distinction between them the one 
meaning roscelin takes bis stand on words the 
other on propositions and he expressly ascribes 
the latter view to abelard 

it is hard to affix a very definite meaning to 
this statement the most probable interpretation 
is that of degerando that he believed universals 
without having a strict independent and objective 
reality to be conceptions — conceptions however 
which to be formed and retained in the mind 
must rest upon the signs of language and that

therefore he made them tum not like rosceun 
on the simple term but on the proposition which 
expresses the relation of subject and attribute 
as they are apprehended by the understanding 
scarcely any other position indeed in the scale of 
thought upon this subject remains for him to 
occupy for while he dissented from the pure 
nominalism of roscelin he fell short of pure con 
ceptualism those who placed universals among 
the creatures of the understanding as the con 
ceptualists do being mentioned by john of salis 
bury as a distinct sect and his own writings 
would prove even in the absence of external 
authority his decided aversion to realism but 
abelard with all his niceness of distinction did 
not escape from the dialectical field unwounded 
like roscelin he had the honour of being defeated 



 he relates with great gusto his contests with his old instructor 
woliam of compeigne and their successful termination i 
forced him by most conclusive arguments to modify or rather to 
sunrender his old opinion concerning universals he had been of 
that mind with regard to their general nature that he asserted the 
same nature to be present at the same time essentially in each of 
the individuals it followed that among these individuals there 
was no diversity of essence but only a variety in the multitude of 
their accidents but afterwards he so reformed his opinion as to 
say that the same nature was present in them not essentiauy but 
indifferently i e as much in one individual as in another 
abelardi vita cap ii a decision which leaves the question open 
after all though the distinction meant to be drawn would seem 
to be like that made afterwards in the disputes between scotists 
and thomists between real and formal presence

nominalism and idealism 

by a great antagonist in this their lot differed 
that roscelin fell by the hands of one who wielded 
weapons like his own while the brand of theo 
logical unsoundness was fixed upon abelard by 
one whose mind occupied by its own beautiful 
mysticism hated the philosophizing spirit of the 
day it is more an honour to him in our eyes 
than it was a consolation in his own that he owed 
his overthrow to st bernard 

but tf in those days the imputation of nominalism 
was fatal realism was not always a protection from 
error a contemporary of abelard gilbert de la 
poree is an example of this he was a realist 
but a bold one the extent of his boldness in 
dialectic has indeed been much overstated his 
treatise on the six principles has been described as 
ah endeavour to cut down aristotles categories 
to six but he was guilty of no such presumption 
he only endeavoured to expand the six later 
predicaments which aristotle had passed cursorily 
over after the plan on which the philosopher had 
treated the first four in introducing these in 
their new shape he goes so far as to hazard a 
definition of form form he says is con 
tingent on matter consisting of simple and in 
variable essence v and flatters himself that thjb

formiola will endure a searching criticism it 
would have been happy for him if he had confined 
himself to such harmless innovations but the 
same spirit led him wrong elsewhere he too was 
condemned for departing from the doctrine of the 
trinity 

it was reserved for a pupil of abelard to eflfect 
what his master in common with others had so 
unsuccessfully attempted — the union of philosophy 
and theolcgy peter lombard effected this end 
by reversing the procedure of previous scholastics 
they had first formed their dialectical notions and 
then applied them to things divine he taking 
his ground on the received theology of the time 
accommodated dialectic to it and so freed it from 
suspicion his cautious book of sentences became 
in after times the basis of comments much bolder 
than the text on which they were founded or 
thodox in faith and philosophy he completed for 
the time the victory of realism and like all other 
principles that are not sound at heart though a 
good watchword in a battle it becomes un 
interesting and unprofitable immediately on its 
success we will proceed at once to some con 
siderations which will bear upon the history of its

finally established was not really safe there 
were enemies within the camp from the first 
john of salisbury who died as early as a d 



nominalism and realism 

recognises no less than six different sects of realists 
these may be however fairly reduced to four — 
those who adopted the platonic doctrine of ideas 
and held that the names of genera and species 
belonged properly only to those objectively ex 
isting universals — those who considered that the 
individual contained the whole essence of the class 
and was in fact when viewed from a certain point 
itself the universal as when it is said that plato 
is as to his manhood a species— those who 
asserted that the whole aggregate of individuals 
was identical with the universal — and those who 
regarded the universal as a substance in some 
way existing in the singular these sects it will 
be seen agree in nothing except in all calling 
universals things 

the three former views however ultimately 
gave way to the last of which aquinas was the 
great advocate it became a received doctrine 
that the one universal existed in the many indi 
viduals but this basis of agreement did not shut 
out all dispute the meaning of the formula was 
not so clear but that enquirers would ask how the 
universal existed in the individuals 

on this point there was an ominous schism of 
the schoolmen dominican and franciscan could 
not agree even on the abstract questions of phi 
losophy their differences extended from ques 
tions of free will and predestination to logic the 
school of scotists arose and called into existence 



 nominalism and realism 

the rival school of thomists as defenders of the 
great dominican authority the followers of 
aquinas held that the universal existed really 
in the individuals the disciples of duns scotus 
maintained that it existed only formally the 
latter went so far as to abandon the old title of 
reausts and assume that of formalists in order 
that their very title might protest against the 
doctrine of their antagonists and without endear 
vouring to explain the subtle distinction between 
realism and formalism we may assume that the 
innovators in rejecting the old watchword vir 
tually though unconsciously relinquished the cause 
which it had smfibolized so long 

the scotists themselves were or thought they 
were still opposed to nominausm but the next 
generation of thought showed the actual tendency 
of their views out of their school rose ockham 
and with him the opposition to realism revived 
once more in impugning the doctrine of the ex 
istence of universals as substances he directed his 
attacks especially against scotus under whom he 
had studied we must not confound his opinions 
with those of roscelin and his disciples ockham 



 it should be observed that the two doctors did not themselves 
come into contact thomas aquinas died a d the 
chronology of duns scotus is doubtful but taking the most 
probable date of his death a d and following the account 
which gives him the short life of years we should fix his 
birth in the very year in which aquinas died 



nominausm and rlism 

in asserting that universals existed but existed 
only in the mind answers exactly to a modem 
conceptualist his teaching was on this point 
clear distinct and sound though expressed and 
defended with a quaint and technical minuteness of 
accuracy which proves him every way a match for 
any of his scholastic brotherhood 

 every universal he taught is really a sin 
gular in itself and therefore is only a universal in 
virtue of its signification which is a sign of many 
things this is the doctrine of avicenna who 
teaches that a single form in the understanding is 
related to a multitude of things and is therefore a 
universal because it is an intention in the intel 
lect whose operation does not vary to whatsoever 
you apply it it follows that this form though in 
relation to the individuals it is a universal yet in 
relation to the mind on which it is impressed is 
itself only an individual for it is one of the forms 
which are in the understanding this is a spe 
cimen of his positive reasoning his negative goes 
to prove generally that no universal is any thing 
external to the mind it may be worth while to 
show how he fought his adversaries with their 
own weapons • no universal he urges is a 
singular substance for this granted it would 
follow that socrates is a universal for there is no 
more reason why one singular substance should

be a universal than another this is rather an 
endeavour to throw the weight of the proof upon 
the adversary the following is a more direct and 
at the same time more complete argument if 
any substance be as is supposed more things than 
one it must be either several singulars or several 
universals if the former be allowed it follows 
that a certain substance will be e g several men 
and then although the universal will be distinct 
from any one particular man it will necessarily be 
the same with all the particulars together but if 
we take the other alternative that one substance 
is several universals we must then ask the ques 
tion — is this universal several things or only one t 
if the answer be that it is only one it follows that 
it is really a singular if the answer be that it is 
several things i enquire again whether it is several 
universals or several singulars and so on to 
infinity theology too was brought to bear on 
the point at issue if the realist opinion were 
true god could not annihilate one individual with 
out destroying all for to annihilate any individual 
he must destroy all that is of its essenca con 
sequently he must destroy the universal which 
exists both in it and in other individuals and these 
could not continue to exist when deprived of 
a part of their substance such as the universal is 
supposed to be we will not endeavour to fodow 
him where in discussing the scotist opinion of

the formal presence of the universal in the in

opinions like these not long after the opening of 
the fourteenth century were published by ockham 
firom the theological chair of paris • they pro 
duced as much excitement as either fiiend or 
enemy could have desired and argument was 
not the only means of discussing them employed 
ockham himself for the ready support which 
he gave philip the fair against the pope by 
vindicating the rights of the temporal power and 
other like acts of insubordination was rewarded 
with the pontifical anathema in more than one 
university the new doctrines were contested with 
blows and bloodshed when we remember that 
the opinions both of scotus and ockham were 
probably formed within the walls of merton we 
should be surprised if oxford had been backward 
in the dispute direct persecution was brought to 
bear in ockhams other university of paris and

and characteristic may he better thrown into a note and preserved

nature as aqninas himself bad inpoyed againsft the arerroistic

elsewhere louis the eleventh by an edict which 
did not prove ultimately successftil condemned the 
nominalist teaching and forbade the study of the 
works of ockham and his most famous disciples 
so the university of leipsic owes its origin to the 
expulsion of the nominalists from prague it is 
said that the universities of vienna and heidel 
berg were nominalist from their foundation 
aventinus who flourished at the beginning of the 
sixteenth century mentions that the schools of 
paris erdfart ingoldstat and vienna were then 
in nominalist hands the opinions of ockham 
when for the time silenced in france had thus 
after taking root deeply in their native home of 
england extended themselves to germany 
luther melancthon and other reformers pro 
fessed their allegiance to them it would seem 
the old theology could scarcely have been assailed 
except with nominalist arms it would have stood 
impregnable against any foes but such as were 
acquainted with its form and devices while they 
had detached themselves from its spirit 

enough has now been said on the history of this 
great question of the mediaeval philosophy we 
have seen how realism triumphed in the first great 
contest of opinion and how in the security which 
followed on this triumph diversities once more 
crept in till nominalism at last revived revive it 

 the university of vienna was founded ad that of 
heidelberg ad

needs must after the speculations of duns scotus 
the belief had not strength and foundation enough 
to exist without the symbol when the scotists 
took the name of formalists they virtually gave 
up the cause to which they professed to adhere 
ockhams claim to distinction lies in the skill and 
perseverance with which he urged his opinions 
the course of things must have led many men 
simultaneously with him to entertain them 

and now it may be asked — who were in the 
right nominalists or realists the query deserves 
an answer for the question about the nature of 
tjniversals is not merely one of words more 
importance indeed was attached to it in the 
middle ages than it deserved but men were 
wrong in this matter only because they were con 
sistent they considered the question as a logical 
one and their logic identified itself with their 
philosophy and their philosophy ran up into 
theology and theology was in those days a 
subject of very direct and personal import we 
are indifferent to universals now because the 
ruling of the point either way would not im 
mediately affect daily life or the opinions of prac 
tical men it is this and not any superiority to 
the difficulty or successful solution of it which 
has allowed the cries of nominalist and realist to 
die away 

we will endeavour therefore to bring the dis 
pute to an issue and that we may the better do 
so will first define our terms here etymology

 nominalism and bbalism 

comesi to our aid nominalism in its strict sense 
indicates a belief that universals are only names 
realism asserts that they are things convenience 
suggests that we should adopt a third term of later 
origin conceptualism as expressing the opinion 
of those who hold universals to be conceptions 

nominalism then in its strict sense of a beuef 
that universals are only names is indefensible 
roscelin who held it deserved the censures which 
were heaped upon him as the virtual destroyer of 
philosophy more will be said upon this point 
when we come to the logicians of the verbal 
school the legitimate successors of the nominalists 
sufikce it for the present to say that they make of 
necessity the operation of thought merely mecha 
nical and invert the obvious facts of the case by 
making reason a function of language instead of 
seeing in language a consequence of reasoning 
formal argument against them is unnecessary 
their own speculations sufficiently confiite them 
which they would refuse to admit to have no other 
subject than words like the dogmatical sceptics 
who asserted positively that nothing could be 
known they are silenced or should be by their 
own protestations 

it must be remembered however that other 
opinions beside those of roscelin bore the title of 
nominalism it would be unjust to fix it in its 
original meaning in spite of his protest against 
the doctrine on abelard it became indeed syno 
nymous with antirealist and descended to ockham

nominalism and realism 

and his school as their natural heritage but ock 
ham was really what we should call a conceptual 
alist we have seen that he held universals to 
exists and that really in the mind to be in ct 
mental forms singular in themselves but universal 
in their application thus every common term 
would represent some individual conception in the 
mind of the conceiver which should be applicable 
indifferently and without variation to many exist 
ing things this opinion if it be not all the truth 
is true as far as it goes and was at the time anta 
gonist to a mischievous error for ockham taught 
also as we have seen negatively that a universal 
is not a substance existing external to the mind 
this was the opinion of the realists of his day 
though realism in some of its modified forms had 
not always necessarily implied so much at first 
it was merely a protest against those who assigned 
to universals only a nominal existence it was con 
cluded that they existed really ywhether in the 
mind or external to it by themselves or in composi 
tion was left as yet undecided so if we refer to 
the sects of realists mentioned by john of salisbury 
we find one division holding that the whole aggre 
gate of individuals was the universal there is 
nothing extravagant fanciful mystical or irrational 
in this view it has been held very commonly by 
hardheaded men in our own day it differs from 
that of ockham only by the omission of a step 
which may easily be supplied the two opinions 



 nominalism and realism 

meet in the following formula — the common noun 
represents an individual conception which is derived 
from some known individuals of the class and is 
applicable to them all known and unknown 
against this form of realism ockham did not put 
in a protest 

neither do his arguments apply directly to the 
second class of realists mentioned by john of 
salisbury who held as he informs us that the 
individual as containing the whole essence of the 
clas was in a certain point of view itself the 
universal this opinion was declared to be obsolete 
by the authority who has recorded it it was very 
probably the teaching of william of compeigne 
whom abelard prided himself on having subdued 
we cannot assign it any definite value when 
detached frouk the other opinions of those who 
entertained it thus much only we can be sure of 
that it destroyed the strong and natural antithesis 
between individual and universal by a form of 
speech in which they were represented as nearly 
if not quite identical the tendency of the error 
would depend on circumstances more than one 
authority has endeavoured to connect with the 
scholastic realism the doctrine of spinosa that 
god is the one substance of which all things are 
modes this is probably a mistake but it suggests 
an example to our present purpose that doctrine 
always mischievous to the last degree becomes 
practically either atheism or pantheism according 



nominalism and bbalism 

as he who adopts it taking his notion of substance 
from the world around him degrades his conception 
of god to suit it or on the other hand starting 
with some high theory of the first being interprets 
all else by it and raises all forms of existence which 
meet his eye to a leivel which is inconsistent with 
sense and reason in like manner he who should 
assert that individuals and universals are the same 
would be a most unintelligible mystic if he took 
the conunon view of a universal an equally 
unintelligible sensualist if he adopted the ordinary 
notion of an individual 

the dominant realism of the schools was as we 
have seen of another kind and regarded the uni 
versal as a substance in some way existing in the 
individual the manner of its existence therein 
was it will be remembered the point of dispute 
between the thomists and scotists against 
either shape of the doctrine ockham has left us 
little to urge his arguments are to the point 
and conclusive and have moreover this great 
advantage that he from education and familiarity 
most likely understood to a degree impossible to 
us the meaning of the position he aimed at over 
throwing 

the remaining kind of reausm is that to which 
nobler minds are natiually prone and which owes its 
origin to the divine plato that method of stating 
his doctrine of ideas in which they are regarded as 
existing in the mind of god seems to admit of 



 nominalism and bbalim 

an easy defence surely it may be argued if the 
creation was as we know it was orderly and 
regular if the clash of circumstances did not 
develope the different gradations of being out of 
a primitive chaos but class after class came into 
existence at the bidding of the divine word 
there can be no error in looking to that eternal 
word as the seat of universals these are not 
merely the aggregate of individuals much less the 
conceptions which we have derived from them 
still less that language which so imperfectly ex 
presses thoughts imperfect in themselves but abide 
rather in that unchangeable word from whom 
things and conceptions and language alike pro 
ceed 

a few words on this view of the subject may be 
said by way of conclusion 

we may observe in the first place that a state 
ment like this however pious and true does not 
amount to realism unless coupled with some 
further hypothesis realism requires that the 
universal shall exist as a substance in the highest 
category and not merely as an attribute so that 
according to the scholastic method of treating 
such subjects we must enter into the question 
how ideas exist in the divine mind and determine 
that they inhere as substances in a higher sub 
stance before we can be realists indeed and 
this was the opinion of most authorities from 
boethius downward but at present we shall 



noianaiiism and realism 

probably be of opinion that such a question 
caimot be answered one way or the other without 
considerable danger of canting speculation beyond 
the legitimate sphere of reason 

but waiving this objection a further caution is 
necessary to those who think realism thus con 
genial with their theology granting that all true 
and genuine universals have their seat in the 
divine mind a further question arises — what are 
true and genuine universals surely we cannot 
boldly assume that every common term in the 
present state of language is true to its original 
purpose with all our ignorance of the nature of 
things all our mistaken speculations all our con 
ventionalities of thought and language can we 
venture to think that we have always exercised 
the powers of abstraction and generalization aright 
and in default of such rightful exercise who can 
answer that the universals on which we have 
fixed are true who shall say that the classes 
which we have formed are in all cases grounded on 
the nature of things and correspond to the in 
tention of the divine author of the gradations of 
the universe 

we take for granted and justly the correctness 
of our own involuntary and spontaneous clas 
sificaticm what we do insensibly we generally 
do rightly we need not fear that we are wrong 
in classing all men or all animals or all virtues or 
all colours or all sounds together but when by 



 nominalism and r£alism 

a laborious effort of the niind we endeavour to 
arrange these classes which we gamed without 
such effort in subordination to each other when 
for instance we would ascertain the precise relation 
in which the class man stands to the class animal 
we cannot answer for our success viewed as a 
statement of abstract truths f the zoological ar 
rangement of linnaeus was rights that of cuvier is 
wrong only when we are assured on the best 
evidence that we have attained to the real order 
of things and understand their relative position in 
the scale of creation can we assert positively that 
our class terms are valid and represent any natural 
universal to make the assumption at an earlier 
stage would be in all probability to fix ourselves 
irrevocably in error 

we should begin therefore at any rate in our 
enquiries by adopting the conceptualist or as we 
might fairly call it the occamist hjrpothesis we 
should first of all ascertain that our terms are 
definite as representing some distinct mental 
image and if they be so thus far be content with 
them but this point ascertained we come if we 
prosecute our enquiry to another doubt how 
far do these conceptions definite though they be 
find their correlatives in the nature of things 
what proof is there that when we arrange these 
under some wider conception or on the other 
hand group lower classes and individuals under 
them our arrangement can claim the title of 



nominaltsbi and realism 

natural unless we can claim this dignity for it 
we cannot set a high value on our classterms 
they will stand at best as symbols of a provisional 
classification which greater research or more skil 
ful analysis may at any moment supersede 

to begin therefore by assuming that even the 
most modified form of realism is true on the exist 
ing state of things would be to begin with a mistake 
it stands in this respect on par with the scho 
lastic system as a whole it is a great aspiration 
which has never yet been verified we may 
cherish it as an ideal but as nothing more our 
knowledge is far too imperfect to allow us to assert 
that we class the phenomena of the world at large 
uniformly according to their natural classes in 
some provinces of science the work has been 
readily and satisfactorily accomplished we have 
no hesitation in affirming that in mathematics the 
divisions of figures according to the number of their 
dimensions of lines into curved and straight of 
angles into right acute and obtuse of quantities in 
general into equal and unequal are really natural 
and give us the knowledge of natmral kinds on 
other subjects as in botany we seem to have 
approximated to a true classification though the 
line of demarcation between the several classes is 
far from being in all cases accurately drawn at 
present sometimes as in the case with zoology 
it seems doubtful if the problem has been solved 
sometimes as with mineralogy the work still re

mains to be accompkshed if the chry stallograpbic 
idea be tnie the arrangement of conceptions mider 
it is quite incomplete on the whole we must be 
content to allow that the conceptualistic yiew of

the modern view of the relation of logic 

to science 

the deductive method of investigation though 
theoretically the most perfect has when applied 
to most subjects important practical defects its 
very ideal perfection destroys its actual utility 
that it may be valid there must be perfect 
coherence among its parts perfect dependence on 
first premises one probability admitted destroys 
the certainty of the whole one falsehood anni 
hilates its value no compensating apparatus can 
make up for the presence of a doubt or remedy 
the consequences of a ingle error even omissions 
which are not positive errors are equally fatal to 
its pretensions an element of calculation left out 
at the beginning cannot be introduced afterwards 
there is no provision for accommodating fresh 
principles when the reasoning has once begun 
there may be no doubt no retraction all must 
be imhesitating progress onwards 

the scholastic system then might naturally be 
expected to fail it was a mould far too fine and 
exquisite for the material to be shaped in it had 
all its premises been necessary truths the scheme

would have been unexceptionable proof might 
have hung on proof in continual succession but 
neither aristotle nor the fathers were infallible 
either in principles or facts nor can the words 
of scripture be taken always as expressing the 
literal truth on subjects not religious we allow 
for instance the fallaciousness of the argument 
from holy writ against galileo the schoolmen 
would have asserted its validity as their admirers 
did they overrated in fact altogether the mo 
dauty of their premises they argued from data 
which were general rules at the best and often 
only probable in a low degree and sometimes 
capable of being proved false by very little enquiry 
as if they were absolutely true and immutable laws 
of the universe we know how rapidly the value 
of probabilities decreases when they are combined 
deductively one fraction multiplies into another 
and the thread of ukelihood spreads out into the 
merest possibility we soon become incapable 
of affixing to conclusions thus gained any practical 
value the argument may serve as a clue to 
guide us but not as a chain on which we can 
depend if they relate to matters of experience 
we call in observation or experiment to confirm 
them if they cannot be so verified we corroborate 
them by analogy or example or some other such 
compendious aid to proof if these fail us we 
must leave them without assigning them any im

process of reasoning less high in its character than 
the deductive but better suited to the msttter in 
hand 

the fate of the scholastic philosophy may serve 
to illustrate these remarks boldly did it proceed 
at first ramifying in all directions in dependence 
on its central trunk descending by degrees from 
broad universals and elevated speculations it 
calme at length to the region of practical truth 
and here the great mental defect of the schoolmen 
betrayed itself their perceptive powers were 
quite sacrificed to the reflective they neither 
used observation on the creatures of the world 
without nor employed imagination in creating a 
new world within therefore they seem to have 
reasoned and written mechanically and without 
any object external to the process of reasoning or 
writing itself it would be hard to say at what 
their philosophy aims except its own complete 
ness when consequently in their course they 
came to the line which marked the sphere of 
actual life and conduct no instinct bade them stop 
they traversed the level of ordinary thought 
without heed or remark only to descend below it 
a few steps sufficed for the passage from a question 
as to the natiue of the divine understanding or 
the laws which umit the operations of god to a 
discussion of some minute metaphysical question or 
the discovery in some ordinary word of some half 
dozen senses which noue but a masterschoolman 

g 



 the modern view op the 

could then devise and which now without some 
pupillage it is very difficult to follow 

accordingly the predominant feeling of the 
schoolmen turned them away from the region of 
physic which leaves least room for mere dwelling 
upon terms without affixing to them a meaning 
aristotles works on this subject as on others met 
indeed vnth their share of comment but deduc 
tions from his principles would have been apt to 
bring a speculator fiill tilt against some obvious 
and opposing fact which would have pierced his 
thin and airy system and caused it in a moment 
to collapse hence arose the necessity of avoiding 
this delicate ground and either neglecting physic 
altogether or running it up into metaphysical 
questions about the nature for instance of the 
principles of motion or causation or the distinction 
of matter and form those schoolmen who had 
the strongest physical turn seem aliens from their 
brethren roger bacon ranks with them in little 
beside date and the vast learning of albertus 
magnus has had small influence on the world 
when compared with the acute and systematic 
deductions of his great pupil aquinas 

thus the ultimate fortune of scholasticism 
differed according to its subject it naturally 
failed first when the independent observation of 
facts caused its truth to be tested such dis 
coveries as those of galileo with regard to the 
falsity of the oncereceived laws of motion involved

the system in disgrace consequences could not 
be trusted where premises were so false and when 
one set of premises had signally given way little 
confidence could be placed on any other which 
rested on uke authority 

botany again which as connected with medicine 
was all along of great practical importance and 
which to be cultivated with any reasonable hope 
of success evidently demands the attention of the 
student not only to descriptions of plants but to the 
plants themselves was one of the first subjects on 
which enquirers laying aside useless comments 
on theophrastus and other authorities betook 
themselves first of all to the study of facts and 
those gained to their classification and arrange 
ment 

so on a third and more important topic the 
schoolmen had fashioned theology after their own 
mind and incorporated with it their own views of 
church authority and a characteristic doctrine of 
the sacraments these were something more than 
speculative opinions and these too received a 
heavy blow at the reformation 

but in morals and metaphysic and method in 
general as distinct from its application their 
system long lasted on to a great degree unques 
tionable ultimately it sank into neglect only on 
account of its evident unprofitableness it e 
patiated at its own pleasure and sufficiently widely 
to prove itself nugatory or like a force expend

vsrhich to act and was therefore of no calculable 
value the walls and bulwarks stood entire but 
they were also undefended the city was deserted 
by its old inhabitants and the enemy thought 
demolition unnecessary laboiu 

the endeavour then to work out the aristotelian 
idea of wisdom had failed philosophy had made 
the effort and now that its ill success was evident 
seemed dispirited and remiss imable to be satisfied 
with the result of its labours and yet with no 
heart to begin them anew she needed some 
novel idea to stimulate her exertions to give a 
fresh interest to her old field of speculation and 
serve as a clue in her resumed researches such 
an idea was given by the virtual father of modern 
philosophy lord bacon 

his work was in many respects closely like that 
of aristotle neither the author of the old or of 



 it is curious to see how in many cases the old form remained 
when the substance was departed — how for instance sanderson 
having treated at length of the predicaments in the earlier parts of 
his logic gives towards its close as examples of a popular 
arrangement of common places the distribution of facts under 
either the len categories or the ten commandments append

the new organon elaborated the system of which 
he was to bear the honours hereafter each pro 
posed an idea which was left for others to adopt 
and perfect the collections of each in the way 
of facts and materials were comparatively worth 
less they were great generals the labour of 
whose hands was of little importance when com 
pared to the weight of their commands each 
displayed that boldness which is one of the surest 
auguries of success and in his day called the 
attention of all with a confidence which created 
confidence in its turn to his own idea of perfect 
science 

nor was the form which this idea assumed on 
the respective minds of these great thinkers so 
different as we are apt at first to imagine lord 
bacon does not seem to have thought less highly 
of the possible results of scientific research than 
aristotle they both looked to the absolute unity 
of all knowledge as its state of ideal perfection 
without declaring positively whether they thought 
such state attainable or not they both thought 
that philosophy would find its fulfilment in the 
subordination and arrangement of many truths 
under one they differed mainly in the method 
by which they thought this subordination and 
arrangement was to be attained they adopted 
each his own mode and order of investigation 
while they looked to the end of investigation as 
one and the same 



 the modn view of tfik 

the aristotelians perhaps it is safer and fairer 
here to speak of the pupils than of the naster 
made as we have seen the many depend upon the 
one they took that order of science which 
though it be that of the divine mind is one which 
requires more perfect discernment and accuracy 
in its application to general subjects than we can 
command one metaphor seems to have been con 
tinually before their minds most suitable to the 
whole aspect of their system and recommended to 
christians still more by its use in holy writ — that 
of the tree of knowledge all the ramifications of 
truth were supported actually by its single trunk 
as they had been contained virtually in the idea 
of being its seed descartes a man of such genius 
that we the more regret the accusations of plagiarism 
from the schoolmen and from every other acces 
sible source which are continually brought against 
him draws out the figure rather happily the 
whole of philosophy he tells us is as a tree whose 
roots are metaphysic whose trunk is physic whose 
boughs shooting forth therefrom are all the other 
sciences which reduce on the whole to the three 
principal heads of medicine mechanic and ethic — 
i mean that most exalted and perfect discipline of 
manners which presupposes the perfect knowledge 
of other sciencesandis therefore the last and highest 
grade of wisdom just then as fruits are gathered 
neither from the roots of trees nor from the trunk 
but only from the end of the boughs so the chief 



relation of logic to scikncb 

use of philosophy lies in those parts of it which are 
necessarily the last to be learned 

appropriate as this figure is expressing not only 
the form and configuration but the natural deve 
lopment and inward growth of a philosophical 
system the fact could not at last be denied that 
the scholastic tree was withered if not dead 
stretching forth bare boughs through the heavens 
and fixed not by roots but by its sheer bulk and 
ponderosity 

lord bacon at once inverted the method and 
supplanted the metaphor just as copernicus 
when he perceived the endless complexity in 
volved in the supposition that the sun moved 
round the earth tried and successfully to attain 
a simpler expression of the facts of astronomy 
by supposing the earth to move round the sun 
just as in later times and with far more doubtful 
success kant acting on this earlier example 
endeavoured to reduce metaphysic to a simi 
lar basis by making our conceptions determine 
phenomena and not as had been previously 
assumed phenomena determine our concep 
tions so lord bacon standing between the 
two thinkers both in time and in intellectual 
position with a keen perception of either kind of 
truth curious both in facts and laws in physic 
and in metaphysic ventured on the experiment 
from which so much good has resulted of in 

 praefieit ad principia philosophiae 



 the modern view of the 

verting while he preserved the old idea of 
science still holding a belief in its possible 
ultimate reduction to a single head insisting on 
the necessity of its unity and order but building 
up the unity on the plurality not deducing the 
plurality as a consequence from the unity 

accordingly the figure by which he represented 
the whole sum of science was not a tree but a 
pyramid on this he insists in the wellknown 
passage which occurs both in the advancement of 
iearning and in the corresponding part of his great 
latin work it is the duty he reminds us 
and virtue of all knowledge to abridge the 
infinity of individual experience as much as the 
conception of truth will permit and to remedy 
the complaint of vita brevis ars longa which is 
performed by uniting the notions and conceptions 
of sciences for knowledges are as pyramids 
whereof history is the basis so of natural 
philosophy the basis is natural history the stage 
next the basis is physic the stage next the 
vertical point is metaphysic as for the vertical 
point opus quod operatur dem a principio usqtie 
adjinem we know not whether mans agency can 
attain unto it but these three be the true 
stages of knowledge and are to them that are

god they are as the three acclamations sancte 
sancte sancte holy in the description or dilata 
tion of his works holy in the connection or con 
catenation of them and holy in the miion of them 
in a perpetual and uniform law 

according to this view also it will be seen the 
culminating point of science is theology the 
difference is not in position but in order though 
first in nature it is last arrived at so in another 
passage highly illustrative of the manner in which 
he makes the fables of the ancients speak more 
than their inventors meant he expressly teaches 
horns he tells us are attributed by the 
ancients to pan or the universe broad at the 
base but tapering to a point for the whole 
nature of things is pointed like a pyramid the 
individuals over which the base of nature extends 
are infinite these are collected into species them 
selves also numerous the species again rise into 
genera and these too again contract into classes 
still more general till all nature at last seems to 
unite in one which is indicated by the pyramidal 
figure of the horns of pan and no wonder that 
his horns strike the very heavens for the lofty 
things of nature or universal forms in some sense 
touch on divinity and therefore that famous 
chain of homer the chain that is of natural 
causes was said to be fixed to the foot of jupiters 
throne and no one as may be seen has treated 
of metaphysic and the eternal and immutable

truths of nature withdrawing his mind for a time 
from the flux of things without at the same time 
touching on natural theology i so ready and 
natural is the passage from the vertex of the 
pyramid to things divine v 

this was the new turn which lord bacon gave 
to philosophy science appeared to him more 
material and less formal than it had seemed to 
his predecessors they had regarded their method 
as something like a principle of life which super 
seded the ordinary conditions of inanimate nature 
and enabled them to vriden out their knowledge 
as it were from the basis upwards just as 
organization brings about results which cannot 
chemically be accounted for just as the law of 
crystallization seems for a time to suspend the 
operation of the laws of gravity so it appeared 
to them that the conditions of thought could 
control and regulate the conditions of being 
reasoning was something more than the scaffold 
by means of which the building was erected it 
was part of the building itself 

the fabric of knowledge presented itself to 
lord bacon in a different light he thought that 
the tendency of former times had been to over 
rate the powers of reasbn his apprehension was 
that the lawful construction of a science might be 
sacrificed to the love of method and consistency 
he rninds his reader that it is natural for the

mind of man readily to imagine greater order and 
equality in nature than it finds there that it 
 needs not the addition of wings but rather a 
burden as of lead to bar all leaping and flying 
he allowed no power to the intellect of antici 
pating observation and experiment the instru 
ments of science he thought had hitherto cor 
rupted science itself plato had spoiled it with 
theology aristotle with loc proclus with 
mathematics so he proposed to make know 
ledge a congeries of facts which like a pyramid 
would hold together by the natural force of 
cohesion none of the apparatus employed in 
raising it was ultimately to be incorporated with 
it induction was to become a great engine 
which all could work and au with equal success 
his method of investigation was to equalize all 
intellects and this on every subject for he tells 
us as vulgar logic which governs its subjects 
by syllogism pertains to all sciences and not to 
physical science only so likewise our logic 
which proceeds by induction embraces allv 

there is always a danger of riding a metaphor 
to death especially when it is so natural and true 
as to combine itself with the direct argumtent and 
become undistinguishable from it perhaps lord 
bacon has been guilty of this mistake not an

this pyramidal theory of knowledge implies a

while the order and arrangement which the facts 
of science fall into is really essential that de 
pendence and consequence that necessary con 
nection among them which the mind can in some

never yet been established that the idea of a 
science the nucleus around which all its facts 
cluster the principle of that unity which lord 
bacon himself insisted upon is itself merely a

no immediate probability that any organon will

the method of either indifferently the subject 
on which it is engaged determines whether it 
shall follow out the idea to its consequences or 
arrange phenomena under an idea in one

the human mind far less is it thought that the 
formal unity of logic is at all equivalent to a real 
unity of science logic as we shall presently 
see is held indeed to stand in a slightly different 
relation to induction and deduction but in neither 
case is it supposed to give both matter and form 
or so to extend form as to enable us to dispense 
with matter its monarchy is now more sure 
because limited from being in turn a part of 
philosophy and the whole it has descended to 
the level of an instrument

on the diff£e£nt modern schools op logic 

logic then it is now generally allowed is only 
an instrument of philosophy — an instrument as 
contrasted with a part not involved in the idea 
or necessarily boimd up in its existence not even 
an universal preliminary of science though it may 
be indispensable to some minds and highly useful 
to all enough will be granted to show its im 
portance if it be admitted that scientific research 
and scientific statement become more easy by its 
means enough also to attach interest to the 
question which we will now proceed to discuss — 
how does logic prove itself to be thus instrumental 
to philosophy 

the correct answer to this enquiry is also the 
obvious one philosophy it is answered is elabo 
rated by the mind of man and correctness of 
process is an ordinary though not an invariable 
condition of correctness of result it is by regu 
lating thought or the act of the rational mind 
that logic is instrumental to its end it gives 
neither facts nor ideas under which to combine 
them but by its analysis of the mental operations 



on the different modern schools of logic 

it enables us to test the correctness of the com 
binations of phenomena the conclusiveness of the 
consequences from an idea 

there is however more than one school of 
thinkers who regard metaphysic using that word 
in the sense of a science of thought as impossible 
or at least as doubtful and deceptive and a fair 
object of suspicion these while they allow 
the utility of logic prefer accounting for it in 
another way than that mentioned above un 
willing to seak of it as conversant with thought 
or conceptions or inference or mental operations 
in general they assert broadly that logic deals 
either with words or with things 

thus logicians at the very entry of their sub 
ject begin to differ they cannot agree in stating 
with what they have to deal the difference 
among them is sometimes real sometimes only 
verbal but even where it is verbal it is sufficient 
to prove a broad separation of tone in the contend 
ing parties the point at controversy needs some 
explanation and for convenience sake a name 
which involves no reproach may be given to the 
advocates of the several opinions we will then 
divide logicians into three schools according as 
they hold words things or conceptions to be the 
subject of logic and entitle them respectively 
 the verbal the phenomenal and the conceptional 

these divisions find no exact counterpart in 
ancient or medieval logic the connection of 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

thing conception and word was at first much 
more dwelt on than their antithesis the disputes 
as to the origin of language did not materially 
affect the question even those who like aristotle 
derived it from convention admitted this funda 
mental parallelism they assumed as perhaps 
it were wiser for us to assume that our mental 
impressions adequately represent the outward 
world that our language does sufficient justice to 
these mental impressions to decide in which 
the province of logic properly lay was not a 
point of practical importance the regulation of 
either portion of the realm would involve also the 
• proportionate adjustment of the other 

neither again can the question slide hack a it 
sometimes seems inclined to do with that of 
nominalism realism arid conceptualism though 
some of the verbal school are as we shall see the 
legitimate successors of the ancient nominalists 
they should not be confounded with them mem 
bers of the three schools may be perfectly agreed 
in their view of uriiversals besides the dispute 
is not like that of old really extralogical how 
logic furthers science is a question which may 
be entertained without trenching on metaphysic 
not so the other query — what it is that common 
nouns signify 

proceed we then to consider the respective 
claims of these rival views to our regard that 
the conceptional opinion is on the whole correct 



on the different modern schools op logic 

will be best shown by our notice of the errors with 
which it is contrasted our first remarks shall be 
devoted to the verbal school 

those who assert that the regulation of language 
is the province of logic may be guilty only of an 
awkward method of stating a truth they may 
not intend more than to insist on the intimate 
connection between language and thought every 
act of thought they urge and truly is accompanied 
and figured to the mind by some word external or 
internal thinking as naturally seeks its expression 
in language as feeling does in inarticulate sound 
the relation of the sign to the thing signified is in 
each case the same though the one is the expo 
nent of the act of the rational soul the other of 
the irrational just as brutes express pain spon 
taneously by uneasy motion or their natural 
cries so men spontaneously invest their con 
ceptions with an outward clothing that the 
word is not always articulated matters not 
enough if it be imderstood in all probabihty 
however were nature left to run wild we should 
think aloud for the most part and make no more 
secret of our thoughts than children before the 
time of definite reflection do of their feelings it 
is different in society an instinct easily developed 
 teaches us that to utter all that is conceived would

all this is true but it does not nearly amount 

h 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

to a proof that logic must subserve to science only 
by regulating language such regulation is the 
work not of logic but of grammar grammar 
looks to clearness of expression as logic to clear 
ness of conception we may have logical accuracy 
without grammatical this is often the case with 
reflective persons who have lived much alone 
they think methodically and correctly but fail 
in the attempt to communicate their meaning 
and if the endeavour to express ones thoughts 
often shows their indistinctness it does not follow 
that the means which expose the defect will also 
serve as the remedy 

but it may be urged in reply though accuracy 
of thought be really the aim of logic this is 
practically identical with accuracy of language 
for it is only through language that thoughts 
tan be transmitted from one mind to another 
thus it is argued the necessary medium becomes 
for ordinary uses identical with that which it 
conveys 

here however there is twofold fallacy in the 
first place though language be essential to thought 
it does not follow that accuracy of thought will 
always be attended with grammatical accuracy of 
language in fact it is not found to be so an 
idea may be and often is expressed in a calculus 
far less elevated than itself mind overtasks its 
machinery of words and in so doing injures it 
the servant suffers in the endeavour to do justice

to his master thus strict thought is found un 
favourable to the perfection of speech it wears 
away a language just as intense mental action 
wears away the body it decomposes it so to 
speak breaking off its inflections and substituting 
particles in their stead its expressions often only 
escape from being positively ungrammatical by 
declaring their independence of the rules of gram 
mar altogether so mathematics have their owti 
verb of eqaality their ovirn substantives of number 
nullity and infinity thdr own prepositions of ad 
dition subtraction multiplication and division the 
use of which they regulate on principles of their own 
so again all professional idioms and vocabularies 
are by common consent pronounced inelegant and 
awkward even the process of stating an argu 
ment syllogistically or of converting a proposition 
involves the necessity for the most part of verbal 
anomalies who can blame the schoolmen for 
inexactness in the details of thought yet who 
like them ever frittered away even to utter an 
nihilation the expression and genius and in 
a great measure the grammatical structure of a 
language 

secondly it should be observed that logic to 
be usefiil does nat necessarily imply the contact 
of one mind with another it may be and 
often has been used as an instrument of self 
education two disputants need an elaboration of 
vocabulary which the solitary thinker may dis

in fine when we speak of logic as teaching the 
accurate use of language two different things may 
be meant it may be asserted either that logic 
arranges the parts of speech accurately with 
regard to one another or that it so orders them 
as that they shall correspond duly with the process 
of thought the former of these positions would 
have few supporters amounting as it does to an 
absolute fusion of logic and grammar the latter 
while it asserts the separate existence of thought 
and language allows also that the language is 
subservient to the thought that the conception is 
final where the word is instrumental is it not 
then better to fix on thought as the subject of 
logic than on that which only comes under 
consideration as its vehicle and exponent 

it is much to be regretted that so many 
sjrmptoms of an adheon to the opinions of this 
moderate section of the verbal school are to be 
found in the able treatise of archbishop whately 
his definition of logic as the art of employing 
language properly for the purpose of reasoning 
is conceived quite in this spirit to trace this evil 
tendency in detail through his work would be 
quite foreign to our present purpose two of its 
more general features may however be mentioned 
here as illustrative of the turn of mind with which 
this logical theory is associated in the first 



on the different modern schools of logic 

place he is led to attach far too much importance 
to the mere arrangement of words and to measure 
the elasticity and pliability of thought by that of 
the raw material out of which its finished repre 
sentations are fabricated the most striking in 
stance of this defect is found in his way of treating 
hypothetical and inductive arguments he com 
pels methods of reasoning which when viewed 
in the thinking mind are clearly distinct igrom the 
deductive process and fiom each other to bow to 
an artifice of language and submit to the one 
unvarying formula of syllogism and secondly 
he shows a continual disposition to underrate the 
number of real questions at issue among mankind 
and to increase in proportion the number of 
merely verbal differences his common way of 
dealing with contending disputants is to accuse 
them of an equivocation to assure them that 
they either mean the same thing by different 
words or use the same word to signify distinct 
things or if this plan will not succeed he 
looks for some formal error in the argument of 
one of the parties and is ready to assign the 
discrepancy to any cause except that which is 
probably the real one — some broad difference of 
principle underlring the whole discussion and 
forcing as it were the superficial strata of thought 
fiom what would be else their level and unbroken 
direction this is in fact to assume that men can 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

with equal ease be made to be of one mind and of 
one vocabulary 

the truth is that the minds of men differ in 
natural constitution as widely as their bodies as 
we do not all spontaneously move our limbs in the 
same manner so neither do we think alike when 
discipline makes men uniform and simultaneous 
in their motions it only suspends their natural 
peculiarities and does not destroy them though 
the effect of the drilusergeants labours may be 
observable when the soldier is off parade they 
no longer produce an exact uniformity those 
differences of gait and bearing then display them 
selves once more which at th time seemed 
obliterated 

so it is with thought the clever arguer drills 
so to speak the mind of those who follow him 
by a sympathy voluntary or involuntary as the 
case may be they throw themselves into the same 
mental posture with their coryphaeus slowly 
with reluctance perhaps and difficulty minds from 
different regions of thought tend to the same 
point under the guidance and by the attraction 
of a more powerful mind and acquiesce in a 
formula it seems for the moment as if they were 
really agreed they cease to quarrel while they 
stand side by side in formal precision on the 
platform of definition and syllogism yet remove 
the restraints of isystem and they relapse into 



on the different modern schools of logic 

individuality they return to their own points of 
view again and choose their own classifications and 
divisions this implies as real a distinction be 
tween their opinions as a difference on matters of 
fact indeed their conflicting impressions as to 
facts are more easily removable by testimony 
and evidence and renewed observation than their 
diversities of theory here idiosyncrasies come 
into play and nature which has been expelled for 
the time by a logical bifurcation returns 

it is therefore at best a shortsighted wisdom to 
exaggerate the power of language in producing 
agreement and correctness of thought we cannot 
narrow the interval between the act of the mind 
and its symbol the clever logician indeed who 
has formed his own opinions may state them in a 
definite form of words and find this form very 
generally though not very willingly accepted 

m 

he may thence argue that others for the most part 
differ from him only in consequence of the absence 
of formal statement and that were their views as 
distinctly stated as his own the very shadow of 
dispute would vanish the delusion might last 
till men from stating their opinions came to act 
upon them it would then be seen that those who 
adopt a formula on intellectual compulsion reserve 
to themselves the liberty of interpreting it the 
history of nations and of philosophies shows this 
truth more clearly than that of individual minds 
what nice forms of words can apprehend and per 



 on tbe different modern schools of logic 

petuate the leading idea of a school or the consti 
tution of a polity the nomenclature and outward 
form of a system or a state may remain compara 
tively unchanged when its inner life is completely 
altered 

we have hitherto dwelt on what seems rather a 
tendency to error than a positive violation of the 
truth but there is no reason for holding back the 
most decisive condemnation of the extreme party 
of the same school who deny altogether the anti 
thesis between language and thought and thus 
make every question purely verbal 

the three best known supporters of this doctrine 
are hobbes home tooke and condillac of 
these hobbes seems to have struck out the opinion 
for himself in the wanton exercise of his usual 
perverse ingenuity but home tooke and con 
dillac though later in point of time were not 
directly indebted to his teaching their con 
clusions were as they thought perhaps rightly a 
fair inference from the doctrines of locke this 
is one of many instances in which opinions have 
so to speak filtered through a system without being 
incorporated with it for locke though a student 
of hobbes never himself adopted those opinions 
from him which he unintentionally communicated 
to others it was his lot to transmit the infection 
without suffering from it himself 

this erring triad while they agree in theory 
differ somewhat in the subject to which they apply 



on the different modern schools of logic 

it hobbes throws his remarks into a form directly 
bearing on our purpose logic is with him the 
art of computation — simply a peculiar kind of 
mental arithmetic logicians he would have us 
think add together two names to make an af 
firmation and two affirmations to make a syllogism 
and many syllogisms to make a demonstration 
and from the sum or conclusion of a syllogism 
they subtract one proposition to find the other v 
and this is not meant to describe an accident of 
the ratiocinative process but its very substance 
for reason he fiirther tells us is nothing but 
reckoning that is adding and subtracting of the 
consequences of general names agreed upon 
for the marking and signifying of our thoughts 
home tooke takes the grammatical turn and 
speaks principally of the nature of terms it is 
these he says which are simple or complex general 
or abstract and not the ideas which they signify 
while condillac makes his view more a part of a 
metaphysical system and in connection with it 
goes into the wide question of the origin of human 
knowledge we are familiar with his pointed 
saying that science is only a wellassorted lan 
guage 

the difficulty of coping with this error on grounds 
of pure theory kes mainly in the impossibility 
of really grasping its meaning while at first 
sight it appears an intelligible though paradoxical 

 leviathan ch v div of purley p i ch 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

proposition to assert that language and thought are 
identical yet on the endeavour to apprehend and 
handle it it degenerates into simple nonsense the 
quotation for instance from the merry wives of 
windsor which home tooke approves and 
adopts that the lip is parcel of the mind is 
most expressive as a metaphor but absolutely 
unmeaning as a philosophical statement we 
should be illemployed in the endeavom to give it 
a sense which does not belong to it it would be 
a mischievous if not a vain attempt thus to make 
error substantive it will be better to devote some 
space to the consideration not of itself but of 
its results and of the principles with which it is 
associated 

this verbal philosophy then has a close and 
sometimes an avowed connection with materialism 
its founder hobbes denied altogether the dis 
tinction between mind and matter and the sen 
sualism of locke has been usually supposed to 
tend in the same direction thus to confuse word 
and thought leads of course to the theoretical 
annihilation of the latter it becomes a con 
sequence of our bodily organization the laws of 
which it must necessarily follow 

thus it leads from the lowest view of human 
knowledge to the lowest view of human nature in 
general also if thought be only a function of 
language man is better characterized as a speaking

than as a reasoning being for it is more natural 
and more scientific to define by the cause than 
the effect and then to draw any such inference 
fiom mans possessing reason as that his atftions 
are therefore probably fiee or his thinking nature 
immortal becomes at once absurd for none will 
assert such liberty or immortality to be a con 
sequence of speech of which reason itself is on 
this theory a consequence lips and tongue obey 
universally physical laws and are subject to phy 
sical decay but how can the thought be perma 
nent when that fiom which all thought originates 
and of which it is a form is no more 

indeed the opinions on general subjects to 
which the verbal school of logic natiually leads 
are equally narrow and absurd built upon a 
fimdamental proposition which is in the strict 
sense of the word insignificant they resemble one 
of those perspectives which are distorted and 
irregular to the eye of the beholder who regards 
them from any but one given position to under 
stand them at all the connection of thought with 
language which is part of the truth must be 
accepted as a whole thus a wrongheaded con 
sistency a fallacious unity of idea marks the 
whole system and the writings of those who sup 
port it it is liable to nearly all the objections 
which tell against the schoolmen and to many 
more it is as exclusive as dogmatic as con 
sequential and from the insecurity of its basis as 



 on ths different modern schools of logic 

unsound we are apt to overlook the connection 
between the scholastic and the verbal method 
because they are employed for purposes so very 
different because the advocates of the latter vehe 
mently opposed the supporters of the former and 
were as ready to destroy as those had been to 
construct both however agree in asserting the 
practical control of language over truth the 
schoolmen erred in supposing that science could 
be attained by a judicious use of their vocabulary 
in the processes of defining and deducing they 
expected too much from their instruments which 
they exalted to the level of that of which they 
treated the verbal philosophers esteeming their 
great tool less highly have another way of making 
it equal to its work instead of making language 
wide as truth they pare down and narrow the 
truth that it may be containable within the limits 
of language the one argued this follows from 
the force of terms therefore it is true the others 
 this does not follow from the laws of language 
therefore it is not true the former mode of 
thought is right in itself though not necessarily in 
its application the latter is false as a proposition 
and dangerous as a premise the formula how 
ever does not unfairly represent the verbal school 
who are ever involved if in nothing worse in that 
mean and odious form of error which arises from an 
unwillingness to apprehend first truths who meet 
their adversaries attempts at proof only by de 



on the different modern schools of logic 

daring that which they would prove impossible 
and while the rest of the world is resolutely bent 
on asserting glory in the obstinacy of denial 

enough has been now said of these archheretics 
in the first philosophy who hold the same place 
with regard to logic that atheists do to religion 
assuming the identity of cause and effect to escape 
the difficulty of tracing their connection and 
obtaining great clearness it may be though not 
depth in their speculations at the expense of posit 
ing an overwhelmingly absurd paradox as the basis 
of them all we will now pass to the phenomenal 
school of logicians premising some remarks which 
may cast light on its tendencies and sympathies 

authors of formal systems and especially 
those who exemplify them by applying them to 
particular subjects may be divided into two 
classes which we may be allowed to call the 
historical and the prophetical they either trace 
the part which a given idea has played in some 
great work already accomplished or feel that they 
themselves have a great work to do they employ 
some truth which they consider to be eternal 
either in the explanation of what is already past 
or the development of what is yt to be 

the second of these classes for many reasons 
exercises the greater influence over the mass of 
men they unite in their writings two elements 
which are often separated — the gratification both 
of practical and of speculative curiosity the very 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

form of their speculations is for the most part 
pleasing it throws itself into the ideal world 
and gives us pictures of an imaginary state of 
social life or science or art hence we have 
the republic of plato the new atlantis of bacon 
the wilhehn meister of gothe and this ima 
ginative impulse implies a bold confidence on the 
part of the speculators in their own powers which 
excites a corresponding confidence in those who 
follow them 

on the other hand there is a comparative lack 
of interest about the procedure of those who dwell 
mainly on the causes of the past it is a lower office 
to discover the reason of a known fact than to 
deduce independently a fact bpfore unknown from 
k priori considerations of its reasons the mass of 
men are so apt to gain their conclusions first and 
their premises afterwards that they suspect any like 
conduct on the part of those who should be their 
guides as proceeding from the same false con 
fidence in their actions and wishes and the same 
want of confidence in their motives which they 
cannot help detecting in themselves so we find 
practically less results firom the labours of these 
historical thinkers aristotle has only proved so 
great in his power over mankind by having his 
system impregnated with a spirit most alien to his 
own while the soul of plato has at least thrice 
since his own time lighted up the pile of his 
glorious philosophy for a similar reason apolo

getic treatises weigh not so much with men as 
those which act on the offensive the positive 
views which they imply are for the most part 
their real attraction it is when hooker most 
charms that we least think of cartwright so 
again physical researches are to most minds 
more pleasing and attractive than moral because 
they render the discovery of other phenomena 
probable as well as account for those already 
known a discussion of the theory of virtue could 
only rearrange old facts whereas a theory of 
light not only attempts this problem but serves 
as a guide in fresh experiments which are meant 
to issue in new disco verier one reason why 
casuistry has been despised as well as hated is 
because it sometimes attempts to state as deduc 
tions of reason propositions which a healthy mind 
rules by an intuitive decision in like manner the 
endeavour which some logicians have made to 
prove by reasoning truths which we know without 
reasoning such as the laws of opposition has 
reacted to their own discredit 

it will be found that the more successful school 
of theorists flourishes most in times which seem 
disastrous to other learning philosophical anarchy 
affords them the greatest scope if they have 
genius equal to the emergency like patriots who 
rise to save their country the miserable posture of 
things around them kindles their hopes and their 
enthusiasm there can be no doubt what is to be 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

done how is the only question popular support 
too they can make more easily their own the 
prospect of change is more agreeable when ex 
isting circumstances have so little to encourage 
thus plato rose when the errors of the sophists 
had spread to their widest extent and were now 
beating themselves into foam upon the shores of 
thought lrd bacon constructed his inductive 
scheme when men were becoming sensible of the 
absence of all sound philosophy locke wrote the 
more confidently because he felt he was dealing 
the deathblow to an already dying system of 
metaphysic and berkeley seeing the feeble cha 
racter of the scepticism which had originated from 
materialist views aimed his attack against the very 
existence of matter an error which has been 
nearly universal and is showing general symptoms 
of decay affords the readiest opening for the 
advancement of truth 

on the other hand general theories traverse a 
more restricted circle and in a more cautious 
manner when particular branches of knowledge 
are expanding readily rapidly and certainly 
there seems less occasion for novel speculations 
however ingenious and acute when all is going 
on well without them original considerations of 
method it appears may be safely neglected when 
the old plan is working effectually at any rate 
logic and other formal systems come in this case 
less prominently forward and adopt a selfdepre

ciating tone do not attempt to innovate but are 
content to follow assume the historical not the 
prophetical aspect and like humble panegyrists 
identify themselves as much as is possible without 
pretending to equal them with the different 
courses of investigation oif which they commemorate 
the triumph 

perhaps we may thus account foi some of the 
least desirable peculiarities of mr mills able sys 
tem of logic it implies a submission and con 
cession on the part of formal science a surrender 
at will so to speak of metaphysic to physic the 
favourite notions of logic are transferred from the 
inner to the outward world sequence causation 
and the like are held to be derived from pheno 
mena and not to be conditions of our perceiving 
them the same temper of mind extends ftirther 
and influences the view taken not only of the 
manner in which logic regards its subjects but 
of the subject with which logic is really conversant 
to represent it as dealing with conceptions would 
seem in this view to invest it with too much 
metaphysical dignity to make it sovereign not 
subsidiary and independent in a province of its 
own accordingly it is considered more safe and 
practical to regard it and with it other sciences 
as having to do with things so words are con 
sidered as signs rather of things than of our con 
ceptions of them and in the same spirit it is urged 

 vol i p 
i 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

that the theory which regards a proposition as the 
union of two ideas or conceptions and not of two 
things is when taken by itself most meagre and 
unsatisfactory® 

this view of logic recommends itself to practical 
persons who are not logicians and have no wish to 
become so if for no other reason at least for this 
that it lowers her pretensions in the greatest possible 
degree and leaves her the merest shadow of im 
portance if we adopt it logic at once appearf 
to have no peculiar principles no proper work of 
her own she is the slave rather than the minister 
of science with just enough independent reason to 
do as she is bidden but with by no means enough 
to assert any collateral authority being in her 
nature wholly k posteriori and dependent on phe 
nomena it is they which really give her laws not 
she which fixes their value 

in the mind of more abstract thinkers the same 
view connects itself closely with a doubt if not 
disbelief in the possiljjty of metaphysic or the 
science of mind it enables them to throw logic 
into a more external and objective form to put 
out of sight for the time all the difficulties which 
arise from the consideration of our thinking natiue 
and to make the student lean in confidence on the 
facts of the outward world 

the difference however between this and the 
conceptional theory is but verbal and the relief 

• vol i p 



on the different modern schools of logic 

which it gives to the student is the result of an 
artifice of language and can therefore be of but 
temporary avail logic cannot deal with things 
as contrasted with conceptions though it can with 
things as confused with them in its most objective 
aspect it is conversant with phenomena that is 
with things as they appear to us not as they are 
in themselves this is quite enough to admit the 
whole sea of doubts which are associated with such 
questions as that of the existence of matter and 
the nature of our perceptions so to say that in 
a proposition we mentally unite two things and of 
course a mental union only is possible is to say by 
implication that we unite our conceptions of them 
with due qualifications the two opposed state 
ments melt into one 

the phenomenal school of thought though 
liable to grave objections holds a higher place in 
intellectual dignity than the verbal the latter 
without any real devotion to physic is as we 
have seen of a materialistic cast the former need 
not incline to materiausm while its tendency to 
fiirther physical knowledge is undeniable to 
assert truth to lie merely in language is a step 
toward denying its existence but to the reality 
of the truths of the outward world the phenomenal 
school begins by pledging itself on these it 
fixes its attention observes their laws and ex 
tracts its system from them and in dwelling on 
them it may steer clear of all materialism because

it regards them as lying so to speak at the in 
osculation of man and the universe as being facts 
of our perception into the nature of which per 
ception it does not profess to enter this is so 
far a merit but from the same source with this 
merit flow great defects also if its canon of 
investigation were adopted it would enlarge our 
knowledge in one direction only the facts of 
consciousness it declines analysing though it does 
not object to combining them and the absence of 
such analysis renders it however at home it may 
be in inductive science a most incompetent and 
misafe guide in deduction or in the border 
territories of morals and art for in treating of 
each of these there is a subjective element which 
demands consideration the fundamental ideas 
of deductive science are something more than 
mere abstractions from the phenomena which are 
grouped under them and none of which in them 
selves adequately embody them so again moral 
truth if it is to stand in contrast with physical 
implies the positing of an idea which does not 
conform to the laws of external experience — that 
of the free will and that theory of art which 
would banish its intellectual aspect and place its 
perfection in imitation and execution only is far 
too imperfect and unsatisfactory to recommend 
itself either to the artist or the philosopher 

religion too it is to be feared is a subject 
necessarily undreamt of in this philosophy theo

logy rests if not on the notion of a mediator at 
least on that of mediation — a connection between 
ourselves and god mere contemplation of the 
highest form of excellence avails not except it be 
accompanied by a fashioning which with man 
must always be a conscious fashioning of the 
contemplator to the model of that which he con 
templates an entire resting on the outward 
would be only good were it possible where the 
inward is perfect and any continuous habit of 
thought which turns an imperfect mind wholly 
away from itself prevents its progress towards per 
fection the highest excellency which could 
result from it would resemble that of aristotles 
wise man the merely positive philosopher 
may be deeply cognisant of the physical world 
familiar with the sphere and power of mathematics 
with a deepseated enthusiasm as to the extension 
of knowledge and the possibility of new and more 
perfect combinations in that wonderful social system 
of which man is the monad but the existence of 
god as a first cause is not essential to his specu 
lations — far less of god as a moral governor 
his temptation is to regard the deeper instincts of 
the heart as so many facts which would be usefiil 
in an inductive psychology not as principles of 
action or feeling with a final cause of their own — 
no less than the forming of man after the model 
of his creator 

the conceptional school though it has the 



tk 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

truth on its side is not without its dangers its 
tendency is by passing from the formal to the pure 
science of thought to blend logic with meta 
physic thus it is apt to neglect facts to which 
it should legitimately apply itself and betaking 
itself to general theories work out the world of 
thought without sufficient data or any real guide 
beside the very imperfect test of its own intel 
lectual consistency this defect is however a 
perversion and not a natural consequence of its 
leading tenet and such antecedent systematisa 
tion is a less evil than has been imagined being 
often assumed only for the time by honest and 
candid minds as a clue by means of which to 
conduct hypothetical enquiries it is adopted at 
first as best tallying with the known facts and 
further research may either corroborate modify 
or overthrow it 

in quitting the subject of the different logical 
schools it may be usefiil to give an illustration of 
the practical differences among them in the various 
senses in which they have employed the term 
category much to the bewilderment of those 
who have expected wherever it occurred to 
recognise in it a common meaning 

we naturally look to aristotle in the first place 
for the meaning of the word a category if we 
regard his ue of the term as well as its derivation 
signifies a predication and is therefore primarily 
connected with language accordingly as has 



fn the diffebent modern schools op logic 

been already hinted the ten predicaments are 
gained by an analysis which is mainly grammatical 
and answer to the leading parts of speech and 
certain modifications of them the scheme may 
be stated as follows the category of substance is 
appropriated to nouns substantive which express 
existence independently of time or as it may be 
otherwise put do not imply motion to these 
nouns adjective attach themselves which being 
loosely and generally divided give the three cate 
gories of quantity y quality and relation the verb 
on the other hand as contrasted with the noun 
indicates existence which is in time and connected 
with motion if the time which it implies is past 
our attention is called to a certain state which 
results from some motion which has preceded 
thus the past tenses of verbs come under the 
category of habit the remaining parts of the 
verb are portioned out according to the nature 
of the motion or change implied in the verb itself 
as this is active passive or neuter they fall into 
the categories of action passion or position ad 
verbs which so to speak coalesce with verbs 
supply the two remaining categories of space and 
time 

this division it is easy to see is essentially 
grammatical far from being the only one possible 
probably not the best yet recognising the classes 
of words generally acknowledged and if confined 
to the province of language substantially true and 



 on the different modern schools of logic 

correct if therefore it has not been received it 
has not been vigorously opposed by the verbal 
school home tooke grounds his theory of 
language on the same fundamental division with 
aristotle and hobbes asserting as in con 
sistency he is bound to do that the categories are 
distinctions of words and not of things and ac 
knowledging that they are not a true or exact 
ordination of names passes them by a rare cir 
cumstance with him without any more positive 
censure 

such are the categories of aristotle — in their 
natiure and use as in the method of attaining 
them essentially verbal we have seen however 
that they have been used also as expressing a 
division of things for this purpose they are 
undoubtedly unfitted they are a crossdivision 
according to aristotles own admission quality and 
relation for instance running in to each other in 
the case of habit and position tayng under relation 
as a species under a genus again although in 
a fundamental division we do not require equal 
importance and extent in all the several members 
yet there is something unphilosophical in the dis

stress on the four leading categories and passes 
so summarily over the other six gilbert de la

great results for this or any other attempt at 
altering so greatly the system as it was left by its 
founder without entirely overthrowing it further 
allowing the categories for the time to be an 
exhaustive division they need not therefore be 
a natural one like merely artificial classes they 
have the smallest possible nimiber of distinguishing 
attributes as may be seen by aristotles weak 
attempt at marking out the four principal of them 
by their properties these objections lie against 
the categories on aristotles own hypothesis with 
out any introduction of the distinctive teaching 
of other metaphysical schools when these are 
brought to bear upon them their position and 
claim to notice are yet ftirther altered 

it is onfe of the most usual and natural perhaps 
one of the most pardonable errors of great thinkers 
to believe a far greater identity of aim and purpose 
than really exists between former laboiurers in the 
field which they are cultivating and themselves 
incidental traces of agreement gain imdue im 
portance from their faith in the sympathy of soul 
with soul the unity of knowledge and the pro 
gressiveness of truth they explain the unknown 
by the known and whatever is clear to them is 
taken to illustrate what appears obscure in others 
writers who are devising original systems and 
touch only incidentally upon the opinions of others 
are remarkably given to this error and even 
among those whose peculiar province it is to weigh 



 on the diffekent modern schools of logic 

and compare facts the historian of philosophy as 
of any other branch of knowledge viewing as he 
does the past by the light of the present is apt to 
overrate the degree of excellency attained in 
times gone by an unintentional hint or uncon 
scious anticipation of a truth as yet latent is very 
frequently mistaken for a discovery most men 
whose inventions have benefitted mankind have 
been robbed of some of their glory by some obscure 
forerunner from whom they are unjustly supposed 
to have taken an idea which he had half seen but 
never clearly apprehended and this overesti 
mation of former enquirers sometimes reacts to 
their discredit when they are wrongly supposed to 
have taken the same view with omselves and are 
accordingly censured for imperfections which they 
could not have discerned and for the omission 
of points which were really unessential to their 
system 

we may thus account for the mistaken view 
which kant took of the aristotehan categories 
his metaphysical labours took a very different 
turn from those of most of his predecessors his 
aim was to turn our thoughts mainly on ourselves 
and leaving the nature of the external world 
unexamined to transform metaphysic from being 
the science of the laws of being into the science 
of mind he was anxious to discover how the 
conceptions naturally inherent in our minds 
affect phenomena or things as they appear to 



ok the different modern schools of logic 

us that he might be the better able to ascertain 
this point he attempted an enumeration of these 
conceptions he erroneously supposed however 
that aristotle had already made the attempt in his 
categories and being sensible of the imperfection 
of the scheme had endeavoured to make it more 
complete by the addition of the postpredicaments 
or five supplementary categories but this mistaken 
position independently of its want of external 
evidence is confuted by internal inspection 
sufficed to show that the postpredicaments are 
merely terms of wide and general application 
but having several distinctions of meaning which 
aristotle thought deserving enumeration the last 
of the five for instance is habit which far from 
being supplementary to the categories is in fact a 
category itself 

supposing that we cauld think with kant that 
aristotle in his categories had the design of inves 
tigating those conceptions which dwell in the 
pure understanding his scheme would be indeed 
imperfect and abundantly liable to objection 
the arguments which kant brings against them 
would be on this ground quite conclusive namely 
that our idea oi motion one of the five postpredica 
ments which are opposition priority simultatte 
ousness motion and habit is empirical and not 
derived firom the understanding and that action 
and passion are deduced and not primary concep 
tions time and spcice too with the postpredica 



 on the different modbrt schools of logic 

ments of priority and simultaneoumess must by 
those who admit kants very questionable view 
of time and space be regarded as not belonging 
to the class of conceptions at all but as being 
modes or conditions of our sensibility kant ac 
cordingly substituted for the old array of predica 
ments and postpredicaments a new list devised by 
himself of categories or as he and his followers 
define them subjective conditions of thinking 
 rules which the understanding by means of its 
own essential laws lays at the foundation of nature 
foregoing all the given diversity of consciousness 
or as we may less technically describe them 
conceptions under which alone we can conceive it 
possible that two terms shall be united into a 
proposition and the result is the following list 
of twelve categories unity plurality totality 
affirmation negation limitation independence 
dependence interdependence actuality possibility 
and necessity 

mr mill takes another view of the aristotelian 
categories which makes it necessary for him also 
to devise a new set of his own according to him 
aristotle as well as the schoolmen intended the 
categories to be an enumeration of all things 
capable of being named — an enumeration by the 
summa genera i e the most extensive classes into 
which things could be distributed this position 
we have seen to be true with regard to the school 
men but probably false with regard to aristotle 



on the different modern schools of logic 

granting its truth however there is no difficulty 
in proving that the categories though perhaps 
valid as a division of namesy are obviously invalid 
when taken as a division of things mr mill easily 
establishes this by appealing to the fact which 
has been admitted and illustrated that they are in 
this light a crossdivision and this done he 
proceeds to give us his own categories which are 
four in number all nameable things he tells us 
are either i feelings or states of consciousness 
 minds which experience these feelings iii 
bodies or external objects which excite certain of 
these feelings together with the powers or pro 
perties whereby they excite them and iv the 
successions and coexistences the likenesses and 
unlikenesses between feelings and states of con 
sciousness 

without pretending to discuss this scheme at 
length we may observe that it should at least 
be received with extreme caution in the first 
place it does not seem to be exhaustive seeing 
that no spiritual existence save hiunan minds 
finds a place in it secondly it appears to deny 
the fact and indeed the possibility of spiritual 
infiuences since according to its obvious tenor 
all feelings or states of consciousness come either 
from the mind itself or from bodies external to it 
thirdly even were it an exhaustive division this 
though it would imply its truth would not establish 
its importance it need not be the natural division 



 on the diferent modern schools op logic 

which lies at the base of all sciences its genera 
lisations are of that kind which cannot fairly be 
aissumed on mr mills own principles to be scien 
tific till inductive science has worked its way 
almost up to the apex of knowledge in a word 
as logical it is out of place as metaphysical its 
correctness and usefulness are doubtful 

lists of categories in point of fact are foreign 
to the nature of logic altogether those of ari 
stotle properly belong to grammar those of kant 
to metaphysic in the modem sense of the term 
those of mr mill to metaphysic in its older sense 
or in aristotelian phraseology to general physic 
so we find categories quite independent of logic 
as belonging to the apparatus of each philosophical 
school traces of similar schemes are found in 
the indian philosophy though there it must be 
confessed in close union with logic the pytha 
gorean platonic and stoic schools among the 
greeks had each its corresponding tables and 
thus the word has come to mean the distinctive 
classification of each metaphysician whatsoever his 
system leads him to discuss or howsoever he divides 
it thus reid tells us that the categories of 
locke are three — substance modes and relations 
and those of hume two — ideas and impressions 
and he adds amusingly enough that an excellent 
mathematician of his day desired to substitute for 

 aristotles logic ch ii see ii p ed sir w hamilton

the peripatetic predicaments two only — viz data 
and qucesita 

and now we bid farewell to the historical view 
of logic henceforth the labours of past thinkers 
will come before us only as bearing fruit at present 
in the consequences which have been traced from 
them and from the ideas which they have involun 
tarily suggested 



chap vi 

on logical method in general 

we now proceed to the direct consideration of 
the nature and office of logical method in doing 
so it will be prudent to recapitulate those as 
sumptions regarding it which have been implied 
if not stated in the previous pages 

logic then is no part of philosophy or in 
other words it is not a science the student of 
pure logic has as such no more speculative know 
ledge on any particular subject of investigation when 
he concludes his course than when he began it the 
basis of logic may show through indeed and so 
some insight into metaphysic be gained or its 
application by way of example may inform him of 
physical truths before unknown or extend his 
knowledge as the case may be in art or morals or 
theology but this does not really affect its proper 
nature as a system of rules implying previous 
knowledge and ministering to its further attain 
ment but of little value in themselves as the 
oretic truths and even assuming an imperative 
form more naturally than that of a proposition 

this then is our main point of difference with 
the ancients in another respect we have seen 



on logical method in general 

we differ from the mediaeval teaching for our 
logic though coextensive with philosophy is 
not practically identical with it it exercises no 
supremacy over matter rather the subject to 
which we apply it greatly modifies its nature 
it is not like a glass through which we look and 
which gives its own colouring to every thing seen 
through it rather like a mirror it copies to the 
minds eye that which exists external to itself and 
its praise is to be faithful not to be original as 
that which is presented to it varies it while it 
preserves its identity and truthfiilness nevertheless 
varies or seems to vary also 

this we allow to be the case with logic in 
general abstraction division definition for in 
stance are not purely formal processes they can 
only be considered with reference to a definite 
subject and cannot be applied to all subjects nor 
will they adapt themselves to all which they include 
with equal accuracy and perfection considerations 
of modality again have been introduced into the 
second part of logic they are generally though 
not universally allowed to bear directly or in 
directly on the divisions of propositions in the 
third part again it now seems nearly established 
that the deductive and inductive syllogism are 
two essentially distinct kinds of argument and that 
the nature of the subject under consideration deter 
mines which is the more suitably employed it 
then the nature of the subject exercises such an 



¦i ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ilhabhihsmev 



 on logical method in general 

influence in the several parts of logic over terms 
propositions and syllogisms it is only reasonable 
to suppose that it extends to the whole conjointly 
and may be traced in the consideration of method 
also which is their available combination 

if then in considering the subjects to which 
method applies and the manner in which it applies 
to them we see certain broad divisiofts distinct 
not merely in their accidents but in principle and 
observe that its nature is greatly modified as one 
or another of these is brought under it the same 
law which justifies us in considering inductive 
syllogism as distinct firom deductive because the 
one leads us from singular to universal the other 
in the reverse direction will justify also our dividing 
method into several distinct portions and such 
division appears accordingly to be both desirable 
and necessary 

for though all logic and therefore all logical 
method deals with conceptions it does not deal 
with them always in the same manner concep 
tions may be connected together on a large scale 
but with very different objects and on very dif 
ferent principles take for instance any science 
whether deductive or inductive here we have a 
multitude of conceptions grouped under one lead 
ing conception which we call an idea on some 
received principle of classification and possessing 
among each other in a greater or less degree 
subordination and consequent iality and the ob 



on logical method in general 

ject of this complicated intellectual structure is 
not directly practical use but knowledge it is 
natural that the method here employed should 
differ widely from that which is suitable to a case of 
practical evidence in which certain conceptions 
and combinations of them in the form of proposi 
tions being posited we go on to investigate some 
particular fact or some principle viewed as a fact 
as dependent on them the question being not 
how the whole fabric hangs together though such 
continuity is really indispensable but whether 
from these data such a fact does follow the 
ultimate law of consequence possibly remaining 
unknown and between science and practical 
evidence there lies another field that of art in 
which we do not bestow our attention exclusively 
either on the fact or on principles of subordination 
and consequentiahty but endeavour with a view 
to practice so to combine our conceptions that 
the principles may bear directly on the facts and 
facilitate our cognisance of them 

method then divides itself into these three 
branches — the method of science of art and of 
practical evidence of these the first will here 
after especially claim our attention both as most 
fully illustrating the laws of logic and as being 
the tjrpe towards which the inferior divisions tend 
and to which in proportion as they approximate 
they claim dignity and precedence 



k 



chap vii 

on the method of science 

in all science then when perfectly formed we 
have as has been said above a certain unity of 
structure we find a multitude of conceptions 
grouped together under one leading conception 
which we call an idea on some received principle 
of classification these conceptions possessing 
among each other in a greater or less degree sub 
ordination and consequentiality and the object 
of this combination of conceptions is not directly 
practical use but knowledge this may be 
illustrated from sciences of diflferent kinds the 
distinctions between which shall be given here 
after the points of resemblance are those which 
claim our ttention at present 

to take in the first place the science of geometry 
which will serve as our type of the pure sciences 
here we have the idea suflficiently definite namely 
space or extension under this conceptions of 
very different kinds are grouped together such as 
triangle square circle equal unequal contained 
containing similar proportional those which 
have a more direct reference to the idea of space 



on the method of science 

fall at once under certain elementary and received 
principles of classification suitable to the science 
thus space itself divides according as it is simply 
linear or bounded by lines or surfaces and 
geometrical figures in general divide according to 
the nature of these lines and surfaces as they 
are straight or curved or again according to the 
uniformity or relative proportions of their parts 
as when we speak of certain triangles as equilateral 
and certain solids as regular further when these 
conceptions are arranged in order o formal proof 
there is of course a consequentiality existing 
among them this dependence of part upon part 
and of the whole upon the idea being one of the 
most remarkable features of geometry and this 
consequentiality implies a certain subordination 
for the different propositions do not depend for 
proof directly on the idea but admit among them 
selves of greater and less degrees of generality 
thus the axioms postulates and definitions cover 
very frequently a wider ground than the particular 
theorems and problems and of these some are 
evidently wider in extent than others whatever 
is proved true of triangles in general for instance 
applies to equilateral triangles while the converse 
does not hold 

in the next place botany may stand as a 
specimen of the classificatory sciences here the 
idea may be differently stated as being in the 
abstract vegetable life or in the concrete the 



 on the method of science 

vegetable kingdom the spontaneous observation 
of mankind even prior to scientific enquiry had 
supplied a vast number of conceptions to be 
grouped under this idea the names of individual 
trees and shrubs of different portions and organs 
of the plant exist prior to scientific arrangement 
these are duly grouped under the idea by means 
of certain intermediate conceptions which belong 
properly to the science of botany and may or 
may not be distinctive of the different botanical 
systems and in this arrangement a principle of 
classification is involved — the difference of this 
principle and not any diversity in the detailed 
view of species for instance distinguishing a 
natural froni an artificial arrangement and to 
show that the principle adopted enables us to 
arrange the conceptions in due relation and sub 
ordination to the idea is the task which each 
advocate of a peculiar system undertakes 

of another class of sciences the applied sciences 
we may take mechanics as an example here we 
have one idea viz that of force there are certain 
princqles fiirther according to which we can 
subdivide this idea thus the idea of force com 
bined with the conception of rest or counterpoise 
limits itself to statics when combined with that of 
motion limits itself to dynamics in each of these 
divisions there are other conceptions which enable 
us to subdivide them such are implied in statics 
in the laws of solid and fluid equilibrium and 



on the method of science 

in dynamics in the three great laws of motion 
these when traced into their consequences give 
us certain combinations of conceptions which are 
subordinated to the main idea and connected with 
it through them by a necessary dependence 

lastly a perplexed and complicated science 
like that of astronomy in which deduction and 
observation find place together where different 
parts of the results are gained by different pro 
cesses and in the vast array of laws and inferences 
and general facts and details the unity seems 
almost broken forms no real exception to the 
notion of a science which we have adopted the 
only uncertainty is in which of two ways it shall 
be made to conform to our requisitions in one 
point of view it must surrender its claims to the 
dignity of a distinct science and rank only as the 
application on an enlarged scale of an independ 
ent science to the explanation or it may be pre 
diction of a vast mass of previously arranged and 
classified phenomena astronomy thus becomes 
the mechanics of the heavens and this is the 
explanation of its nature which a mathematician 
would be likely to give or again the physical 
philosopher might ask — what is it which enables 
us to associate so readily in our minds phenomena 
so different as an eclipse and the course of the 
planets and the nature of nebulae and the form of 
the earth and the distance and density of the sun 
but the presence of one idea — that of the universe 



 on the merhod of sciencl 

or in other words of the interdependence of all 
material nature may not astronomy be regarded 
as the science of the universe using for different 
purposes the apparatus both of the classificatory 
and applied sciences and so aiming at the re 
duction to order and imity under this idea of a 
multitude af conceptions drawn from phenomena 
which seem at first likely to perplex as much from 
their unlikeness as their multiplicity 

if the foregoing be as far as it goes a true 
account of the nature of science it is evident that 
any view of scientific method will be in the highest 
degree imperfect which does not treat of scientific 
ideas of the conceptions which range under 
them and of the laws which regulate this ar 
rangement to the first of these subjects we now 
proceed 



chap viii 

on scientific ideas 

a science then however much more it may be 
is at least thus much the union and grouping of 
conceptions under an idea hence arises a ques 
tion evidently deserving our considlsration — what 
the nature of such scientific ideas may be 

the difference between an idea and a conception 
has often been drawn by those who insist on the 
distinction with great xare and deliberation a 
conception it has been said is something derived 
from observation not so ideas which meet with 
nothing exactly answering to them within the 
range of our experience thus ideas are k priori 
conceptions a posteriori and it is only by means 
of the former that the latter are really possible 
for the bare fact taken by itself falls short of the 
conception which may be described as the syn 
thesis of the fact and the idea thus we have an 
idea of the universe under which its different 
phenomena fall into place and from which they 
take their meaning we have an idea of gop as a 
creator from which we derive the power of con 



 on scientific ideas 

ceiving that the impressions produced upon our 
minds through the senses result from really exist 
ing things we have an idea of the soul which 
enables us to realize our own personal identity by 
suggesting that a feeling conceiving thinking 
subject exists as the substratum of every sensation 
conception and thought others go further in 
the same direction and argue that space and time 
which they call conceptions shadow forth dimly 
the ruling ideas of infinity and eternity that the 
divine attributes are ideas under which fall even 
the highest conceptions that from omnipotence 
comes the conception of power from omniscience 
that of knowledge from the independent essence 
of god that of dependent being and so on and 
this brings us to another grade of opinion adopted 
by some namely that equality for instance and 
similarity must be ideas the preexistence of 
which enables the mind to recognise things as like 
and equal these too it is said having no exact 
counterpart in experience for we have never met 
with phenomena which are absolutely like or abso 
lutely equal and now we are evidently trembling 
on the verge of the platonic doctrine according 
to which each visible and perishable phenomenon 
corresponds to some intellectual and eternal idea 
although there may be much truth in the general 
impression which these views convey they cannot 
with any distinctness all be held together in 
deed however true any or were it possible all of 



on scientific ideas 

them might be they would nevertheless not be to 
our purpose for we are seeking a practical 
rather than a metaphysical distinction and are 
investigating the nature not of ideas in general 
but of scientific ideas only sometimes indeed 
that which a metaphysician would recognise as an 
idea lies at the basis of a science thus psycho 
logy if that be at present a real science refers 
itself to the idea of the soul and theology to that 
of god in other cases however what is called 
on the above theories a conception is really a 
scientijfic idea it is for instance on the concep 
tion of space not on the idea of infinity that the 
science of geometry has been raised 

it will be better for our present purpose to take 
a different course from that which speculations 
like those above suggest and passing by all such 
questions as concern the abstract nature of scien 
tific ideas the manner in which they are attained 
their necessary connection with the human mind 
and the like to regard them simply as a species of 
conceptions — that is definitely as conceptions on 
which sciences can be founded our question 
then assumes a more practical shape and may be 
stated as follows — what attributes fit a conception 
to become the foundation of a science 

we shall escape one great danger by throwing 
our enquiry into this form the human mind is 
as we have before observed naturally disposed to 
trust too much to method to venture on this 



 on scientific ideas 

presumption beyond the bounds of experience and 
lawfiil proof and not content with ascertaining 
what is to determine as it thinks what must be 
there have been k priori enumerations on almost 
every subject from the planets downward reasons 
have been given why they and the senses and the 
categories and the main divisions of the world 
and the primitive substances of chemistry should 
be neither more nor less numerous than they were 
supposed to be till fiirther research has proved 
the falsity of the suppositions for which these 
reasonings were to account in some cases and has 
rendered their truth uncertain in others it is 
well to avoid any risk of falling into this delusive 
and untrustworthy mode of enquiry and this end 
will be effected by keeping the above question 
steadily before us — by the presence of what at 
tributes do we distinguish scientific ideas from 
other conceptions 

there is the more reason for taking this view of 
the question because there seems to be on the 
face of things an absolute impossibility of con 
fining these ideas in our present state of know 
ledge to any definite number sometimes con 
ceptions which have been fated to become the 
basis of sciences have been long altogether un 
known as was the case with the ideas of galvanism 
electricity and magnetism sometimes fresh dis 
coveries with regard to a conception which has 
been long familiar elevate it to the dignity of an 



ok scientific ideas 

idea thus the conception of heat long preceded 
the dawn of a science of thermotics sometimes 
the idea though it retains the same name becomes 
from the association of new phenomena with it 
practically so far different that it may be fairly 
doubted whether it be really the same idea as 
before thus optics assumed a new form when 
the ray of colourless light was discovered to be com 
pound and harmonics underwent a still greater 
metamorphosis when the properties of musical 
notes came to be considered as dependent not 
on the length of string but on the number of 
vibrations 

indeed it would seem that science follows as 
surely upon practice in matter of fact as it pre 
cedes it in theory let any set of phenomena 
once be shewn to be of practical importance to 
a large part of society and human industry com 
bines with curiosity in the endeavour to show their 
relation to each other science will soon be at 
work to discover the principle which shall reduce 
the mass of perceptions to order thus medicine 
and theology which appeal directly to the strong 
est and deepest cravings of human nature have 
been again and again systematized on the other 
hand where the importance of a subject is of late 
discovery the corresponding science is of late 
origin also the science of catallactic has only 
arisen since the world has been comparatively 
peacefiil and whole nations and continents have 



 on scientific ideas 

felt their permanent welfare to depend on the 
principles which regulate exchange 

as the world then grows wiser and busier as 
men expand the sphere of their operations sciences 
will increase in number and with them scientific 
ideas it does not follow however that though 
this be true in the long run each advance of 
human science involves a corresponding increase 
in the number of ideas on the contrary their 
number may diminish when two or three ap 
parently distinct branches of knowledge are traced 
back to a common stock and are henceforth 
treated as one so a point of union has been dis 
covered in galvanism electricity and magnetism 
and cuvier has given some hints towards a zoo 
logy or science of life of which botany and 
animal zoology may prove ultimately to be mere 
subdivisions and attempts have been made to ac 
count for vital action in a manner which were it 
correct would bring it according to the different 
theories under either phemistry or electricity 

least of all however can we hope to have all 
sciences reduced to that unity which is implied in 
the scholastic type of deduction or the baconian 
type of induction the thought of one vast 
science grounded on the idea of being furnished 
with its due array of subordinate principles whether 
we call them categories or by some other name 
including in itself all possible knowledge assigning 
its place to every producible phenomenon may 



on scientific ideas 

stand before us as a great ideal but one which we 
must confess is unattainable though some con 
nected sciences may show a disposition to fall into 
each other yet the lines of scientific enquiry must 
in general be treated as parallel and independent 
if there be as there seems to be in the divine 
mind a perfect pyramid of knowledge yet the 
apex is • so far distant from us that not only is it 
itself invisible but the sides of the pyramid have 
no sensible inclination towards it like the vast 
majority of the fixd stars it has no ascertainable 
parallax 

what attributes then we proceed to enquire 
fit a conception to become an idea and be re 
garded as the basis of a science 

it is evident that every scientific idea must be 
distinct and that this distinctness should if pos 
sible be put beyond doubt by definition but 
for reasons which shall be given hereafter scientific 
ideas can very rarely be defined 

distinctness however though requisite to sci 
entific ideas is by no means confined to them 
it is necessary in every conception which we 
employ for whatever purpose in science or art 
or the conduct of life indistinctness is that defect 
of conceptions in general which logic professes to 
remedy if it remain uncured there can be no 
trusting the second and third operations of the 
mind while there is such imperfection in the 
first 



 on scientific tdeas 

obviousness is another feature which though 
essential to scientific ideas is by no means con 
fined to them but it is not like distinctness to 
be sought in all conceptions we have a right to 
expect it only in the idea and in those lowest 
scientific conceptions which in the classificatory 
sciences which perhaps exhibit this principle most 
clearly coincide with the phenomenon common 
sense though not equal to forming sciences 
exercises over them a kind of dominion when 
formed thus the deductive method of investi 
gation requires that some obvious idea with its 
attendant principles whether gained intuitively or 
empirically it matters not should be assumed first 
and then traced into its consequences during 
this process it may be allowed to disappear ifrom 
the siuface of the speculation to become abstruse 
and complicated in the forms which it assumes 
so as to escape the ken of every mind but that 
which is truly scientific but it must issue again 
at last into the light of day and show the result 
of its proceedings not the most abstruse sciences 
are exempt ifrom this law they must be capable 
of being made popular at either extreme in 
geometry for instance the idea of space the 
axioms and definitions on the one hand and the 
enunciations of the particular propositions on the 
other are at once intelligible to many who find 
the greatest difficulty in perceiving how these pro 
positions depend for proof on their ultimate data 



on scientific ideas 

the idea of that most comphcated of all sciences 
astronomy is perhaps the most obvious of all nd 
the results to which it leads are the most generally 
interesting and how many persons have just the 
general idea of botany and zoology and a keen 
sense of the beauty and wondrousness of individual 
instances of animal and vegetable life who on 
these subjects find exceedihg difficulty in passing 
the bounds of the merest empiricism and entering 
into the spirit even of the outlines of a really 
natural system 

it was said above again that the practical 
importance of a conception is necessary in order 
that it may become an idea this however 
seems not quite the kind of test to suit our present 
purpose in this practical importance indeed the 
reason lies which leads the mind of the investigator 
to dwell more upon the conception and found a 
science upon it still it does not indicate a feature 
which belongs to the idea as such but rather an 
antecedent fitness in the conception for its after 
wards becoming an idea 

a more important mark of scientific ideas and 
one which belongs to them more properly as such 
may be found in what we may call their generality 
every science professes a certain breadth of range 
as there cannot be a science of an individual so 
neither can there be of a narrow class this is 
evidently natural we attribute such importance 
to the unity of science simply because it enables 

¦

 on scientific ideas 

us to collect together much which would other 
wise be separate were its field so narrow that 
observation could thoroughly cover it or memory 
exhaust its details or common sense decide upon 
all its questions by the process of weighing each 
particular case we could much more easily dis 
pense with it so we are always disposed to adopt 
as an idea that conception which gives the greatest 
generality the widest possible unity so as we 
have seen the early endeavours after systematic 
truth hit on the magnificent vision of a single 
allembracing science and as knowledge pro 
ceeds men are as we observed very ready to 
diminish the number of sciences by melting several 
into one conjecture on this as on other points 
even outstrips enquiry as at present some enter 
tain the hope of discovering a single science of 
all imponderables the union of statics and 
dynamics under the common name of mechanics 
illustrates the same tendency and perhaps it is 
to the same cause that we must refer the very 
common and it must be allowed justifiable 
inclination for viewing astronomy as a single 
science 

this generality however by itself does not 
satisfy our requisitions we must also have in a 
scientific idea a quality which we may be allowed 
by way of contrast to call particularity or to 
use a phrase more usual and striking though 
perhaps for our present purpose less correct unity 



on scientific ideas 

in science is not enough unless there is also 
plurality 

science we have said must have a certain 
breadth but in that breadth it must not be too 
uniform no universals will serve its purpose 
however wide they may be unless they are capable 
of division and subdivision and so can descend to 
details any system which is deficient either in 
generality or particularity can only half satisfy 
our preconceived notion of scientific perfection 
apriori principles of physics like those which kant 
has given illustrate generally the former of these 
defects they are true enough but when ad 
mitted they are too indefinite in their application 
to be useful and cannot be so combined as by 
linuting each other to descend to particulars 
the idea of being is thus shut out from the 
number of scientific ideas for we can invent 
few propositions of which this can be the subject 
scholastic ingenuity could not discover more than 
three predicates which were suitable to it — unity 
goodness and truth and after its first division 
into substance and attribute the distinctions be 
came either empirical or arbitrary causality is 
another conception which has abundant breadth 
for a scientific idea but which yet is not the 
foundation of a science why is this because 
the number of propositions as to the relation of 
cause to effect is exceedingly limited neither 
does the idea naturally subdivide and so descend 

l 



 on scientific ideas 

to lower conceptions which the mind can readily 
embrace and in which we feel a practical interest 

but a conception may have both generality 
and particularity may associate itself with broad 
universals and allow a multitude of singulars to 
be combined under it and yet be unfitted for a 
scientific idea if it be incapable of consequenr 
tiality unless it be such that the subordinate 
conceptions and propositions seem somehow to 
be connected with it as effect with cause unless 
it be a kind of nucleus of which the whole science 
is a development we cannot allow it to be really 
an idea hence it would seem certain ideas 
have been supposed to be necessarily intuitive 
because when they are once fully understood 
the main principles of the sciences over which 
they preside though gained at first empirically 
assmne the appearance of consequences from 
them be this as it may thus much seems clear 
that every science and therefore every scientific 
idea implies some consequentiality 

this is evident in the pure deductive science of 
geometry which would fall to the ground were it 
not for the definitions axioms and postulates flow 
ing naturally from the idea of space and the several 
propositions which follow being only the legitimate 
consequences of these data the truth is least 
obvious in the purely classificatory sciences 
botany for instance or geology appears at first 
sight to be only the arrangement of phenomena 



on scientific ideas l 

known by observation according to a fixed plan 
and not to involve any notion of consequence 
it might be thought that any introduction here of 
antecedent and consequent cause and effect was 
quite out of place yet it is not really so a 
purely artificial arrangement in which the phe 
nomena are grouped according to an arbitrary 
principle has no claim to the name of a science 
and we shall see hereafter that in proportion as a 
classificatory science becomes natural it approxi 
mates to the consequential type 

all the conceptions then of science the highest 
or idea as well as the intermediate and lowest must 
be distinct the highest and lowest must both 
possess a certain obviousness which is not required 
in the intermediate conceptions which are employed 
to connect them and further the idea which will 
always be a conception of practical importance 
must possess the attributes of generahty parti 
cularity and consequentiality and under this 
the other conceptions must fall according to a 
certain system of classification into the nature 
of that system we may now proceed to enquire 
and this consideration will naturally lead us to 
speak of definition which besides being as was 
remarked above highly conducive to distinctness 
is of the greatest importance in connection with 
several aspects of science 



chap ix 

on classification and definition 

in considering the subject of classification it 
will be of importance to keep constantly in view 
the distinction between the principles on which we 
classify and the method which we nploy in the 
pri the most prominent pomt jdiffence 
is that the principles are material while the 
method is formal the former vary with the dif 
ferent sciences being the main conceptions which 
come to our aid in establishing a connection be 
tween the lowest ccmceptions and the idea the 
latter when these principles are given enables us 
to estimate and as it were to measure the relation 
of the various conceptions included in the science 
to the idea and to each other thus the absence 
presence and number of cotyledons point to the 
principles of classification in a natural system of 
botany and absorption assimilation exhalation 
growth and generation occupy a corresponding 
place in zoology the method of classification 
on the other hand is the same for all the sciences 
and of this we now proceed to treat 

the scheme of predicables contains the method 
of classification which aristotle in part invented in 



on classification and definition 

part found ready to his hand and which has 
descended to us through the schoolmen with 
alterations which affect its form more than its 
substance its most received terms have how 
ever escaped from the schools and become the 
property of the world every one who pretends 
to knowledge talks of genus and species property 
and accident if not with logical accuracy at least 
in a sense of his own and this renders it the 
more desirable that we should retain its termi 
nology and adopt its spirit so far as we properly 
can the objections against innovations on received 
systems apply here with more than usual force 
and it will appear that with some cautions and 
modifications we need not seek a new method of 
classification but may let the predicables stand 

it has been customary to attain the five heads 
of predicables in one of two ways — the one more 
generally known in consequence of its adoption 
by modern logicians according to which species 
expresses the whole essence while genus indicates 
the common differentia the distinguishing part of 
the same essence and property something joined 
necessarily accident something joined contingently 
to it — the other more agreeable to aristotle and 
more commonly employed by the schoolmen 
which begins by separating genus and species as 
coming under the predicament of substance from 
the other predicables which are predicated in 
quality 



 on classification and definition 

 now perhaps it would be unfair to object to the 
term essence when taken barely and without ex 
planation that it implies of necessity as it certainly 
does by association an assent to the realistic 
doctrine of inherent forms at any rate the 
formula which leads us to describe genus by its 
being predicated of things diifering in species as 
species is in its turn of things diflferent in number 
is free from this imputation but they are both 
liable to another objection which lies deeper — 
namely that they assume our possession of the 
power to decide generally what attributes are really 
part of the essence or substance of any given thing 
and what are not 

in other words they assume perhaps unwittingly 
on the part of those who adopt them the possibility 
of a science of being if we could for instance 
satisfactorily answer the question — what is the 
essence of man we should in so doing enumerate 
fully all those attributes in virtue of which the 
name of man is applied to him granting that 
he is according to his essence a rational animal 
all other attributes beside those of animality and 
rationality must fall under one of the lower predi 
cables we could not raise above the level of 
property or accident his outward form his position 
in the animal and in the intellectual world his 
condition as a moral being his capability of govern 
ment or other social relations 

the erroneous consequences which flow from 



on classification and definition 

this view are obvious if we follow it we must 
allow that his definition once attained no re 
searches metaphysical moral religious social 
physiological of which man is the subject can 
have a valid claim to the name of science they 
are the investigations not of the real nature of 
man but only of certain secondary qualities belong 
ing to him they misplace man for the time 
throw him out of his proper rank in the scale of 
things and raise those features of his being which 
are subordinate or collateral to the place of the 
highest dignity thus the unity of knowledge 
would seem to be disturbed and the natural arrange 
ment of truth broken into by a misplaced and 
importunate ingenuity 

such inferences of course cannot be correct it 
is impossible that any one view of mans nature can 
have such right to exclude every other his phy 
sical organization is not to be neglected because 
we attach importance to his reason his individual 
being has no right to overpower his social and so 
on if the system of the predicables is to stand it 
must be placed in a light which will admit of its 
application to sciences in general if we show by 
their aid the relation of a conception to a given 
idea this must not disparage our investigating as 
a separate question its relation to another also 

in order then that the predicables may occupy 
their right position we must be content to regard 
the whole question as one of relation and to 



 on classification and dbfinition 

admits that any given individual cannot on logical 
grounds be ascribed absolutely to any species but 
in order to fix its species and by consequence to 
assign to its other attributes their proper place as 
properties or accidents we must view it in reference 
to some scientific idea 

our old example will not be the worse for being 
the most obvious and most common suppose an 
individual human being put before us and the 
demand made that we should fix his species 
genus difierentia and so on the problem is one 
which with the individual alone given even sup 
posing our knowledge of all the circumstances 
concerning him to be most accurate and perfect 
will defy all attempts at solution let for instance 
the given man be nicholas the emperor of all the 
russias the difficulty will be to ascertain his 
species if this is accomplished all that follows 
will be easy enough but how is this first step to 
be taken of course if we are considering zoology 
or are content to assume that the class to which 
our first natural impulse would lead us to refer 
him is really his species there will be no difiiculty 
in answering at once nicholas is by species a man 
but supposing that we are dwelling rather on some 
idea which does not extend beyond the human 
race that to take a particular case we are con 
structing a science of civil government we shall 
then divide men it may be according as they are 
governed or governors and subdivide the latter 



on classification and definition ld 

according as they govern in common with others 
or are governors sole and this subdivision may be 
fiirther subdivided as they rule absolutely or under 
certain limits of law or constitution in a scheme 
of this kind nicholas will belong to the species 
despot or sole governor without limitation of law 
so under the catallactic science his species will 
be capitalist and the moralist must investigate 
the affiiir of the nuns of minsk and other dealings 
of the father of his people before he decides under 
which of his two exhaustive species the good and 
the bad he must place the czar of russia 

a popular instance like this will serve our im 
mediate purpose which is as we have said not to 
construct a new theory of the predicables but to 
show under what provisos we may acquiesce in 
the old one and it now appears that we are at 
liberty to retain both the received scheme and the 
method of attaining it on the condition however 
either of rejecting the word essence or interpreting 
it as the union of those attributes which are con 
sidered to constitute a class in relation to a given 
idea 

adopting then this manner of regarding essence 
our view of the predicables follows as a matter of 
couri species will evidently be the expression 
of all those attributes which are considered as 
constituting the class relatively to the given idea 
and the notion of classification implies that of 
order and arrangement a class necessarily 



 on classification and definition 

suggests to the mind the existence of collateral 
classes — standing by its side that is as members 
of the same division with these it will have 
certain attributes in common these will be re 
presented by the genus which may be defined as 
the expression of those attributes which a class 
has in common with its collateral classes the 
expression of those attributes in which the class 
differs from its collateral classes will in like 
manner be the differentia 

but supposing certain attributes to be con 
sidered as constituting a class relatively to a given 
idea it is evident that certain other attributes 
might possibly be considered to constitute the 
same class when viewed in relation to another 
idea thus the word man indicates the same 
class whether it comes from the lips of the 
zoologist or the psychologist though the one 
looks to the form which animal life assumes in his 
fellowcreatures the other regards the peculiarity 
of their intellectual constitution a question 
might indeed be raised whether the class was in 
either case strictly speaking the same or whether 
we should not rather speak of two different classes 
including exactly the same individuals but this 
doubt is quite foreign to our present enquiry and 
the two classes if they are theoretically distinct 
must be allowed to be practically the same and 
the point which we have to decide is in what 
light we are to regard those attributes which are 



on classification and definition 

observed uniformly to accompany a class although 
when it was formed in reference to a given idea 
they were quite foreign to that idea and therefore 
were not taken into account in forming it the 
answer of the logician here corresponds with the 
common phraseology of educated men both 
would agree in calling them properties and the 
predicable propiium may accordingly be defined 
as the expression of those attributes which are 
observed uniformly to accompany a class though 
they were not taken into consideration in form 
ing it 

of the remaining predicable accident little 
need be said certain attributes are observed to 
be associated with the individual the question 
naturally arises — are they also associated with the 
class if this be determined in the affirmative 
further questions remain do they by themselves 
constitute the class if so they find their ex 
pression in the species should this not be so — 
do they go to constitute the class if so they are 
either shared by the collateral classes and so fall 
under the r oriistinguish the class in question 
from the collateral classes and are therefore ex 
pressed by the differentia if though associated 
with the class they neither in whole nor in part 
constitute it we have already seen that their ex 
pression is the predicable property if on the 
other hand they neither in whole or in part con 
stitute the class nor are observed uniformly to 



 on classification and definition 

accompany it they fall under the head of accident 
and that predicable may be defined as the expres 
sion of such attributes as neither are taken into 
consideration in forming the class nor are observed 
uniformly to accompany it 

we are now in a position to enter on the subject 
of logical definition for in common phrase we 
define the species by means of its genus and 
difierentia on an accurate use of these terms 
must depend the distinctness of our notion of 
definition and by a natural and common re 
action we shall gain a clearer view of the nature 
and importance of the predicables by viewing 
them in this connection they are part of the 
apparatus and instruments of logic and cannot 
be appreciated unless we consider their use we 
shall learn much of them by seeing them em 
ployed 

in the first place then a corollary with refer 
ence to definition naturally follows firom the above 
remarks it is that all definition is necessarily 
relative and therefore that all attempts at absolute 
definition are firom their very nature failures and 
may be rejected without individual examination 
to any one who assents to the previous theory of 
the predicables this is an evident consequence 
for if all correct definition be as it is commonly 
granted to be by means of genus and differentia 
and the predicables be in their very nature relative 
it will follow of course that definition is entirely 



on classification and definition 

relative also but we may attain the same con 
clusion by a less technical method and one better 
adapted to convince the general reader 

what is definition most authorities would agree 
in answering that it is the statement in its ftilness 
of the meaning of a conception or as some would 
prefer of a term were then absolute definition 
possible it would exhaust the meaning of the 
thing defined to take our old example man 
if he were capable of absolute definition every 
conception that is necessarily associated with the 
conception of man in the mind of the most 
enlightened thinker and most extended enquirer 
must enter into it he could not be defined 
under a folio volume those attributes which 
are observed in him by the physician and the 
moralist have as good a primd facie right to enter 
into his definition as those observed by the meta 
physician and the naturalist if one insists on his 
possession of reason another may dwell on his 
possession of two hands or his place in the scale 
of moral beings or the length of his intestinal 
canal so the definition would needs prove in this 
case an assemblage of most promiscuous and ill 
assorted matter or to take another example 
that of atmospheric air how shall this be defined 
by the proportions of oxygen and azote which 
enter into its composition or by its relation to 
animal life or by its elasticity viewed as a fluid or 
by its properties of refiraction as an optical medium 



 on classification and definition 

those who hold that definition is absolute must 
say — by all of these all of these conceptions 
and many more enter into the notion which an 
educated man entertains of air and to enumerate 
any thing short of the whole would be on this 
hypothesis to define imperfectly 

an absolute definition therefore is impossible on 
account of the prolixity and confiision of ideas 
which it necessarily involves it would resolve 
itself at best into a long string of unconnected 
epithets however complete it might be as a 
general summary of our knowledge on the subject 
it would be utterly wanting in clearness and would 
prove no remedy for indistinctness 

this being granted an important consequence 
follows we must be content with relative de 
finition and therefore a conception will be 
capable of t least as many definitions as there 
are sciences or which is the same scientific ideas 
under which it falls 

this again the logician who has followed the 
previous reasoning will not be slow to admit if 
all the predicables imply a reference to a certain 
scientific idea the definition which is composed 
of two of them will imply such reference also and 
as the ideas multiply the predicables increase 
and with them the definitions also but this 
position like the former admits of being put 
into a more practical form into which we proceed 
to throw it 



on classification and definition 

all definition implies classification in defining 
a classconception and classconceptions alone are 
definable we undertake to show the boundaries 
which separate it from other classes with which 
it might possibly be confused but as each science 
has its own peculiar classification it necessitates 
also a peculiar definition by which the class in 
question may be separated firom all other classes 
which the said science recognises the same 
formula which answers the purpose of distinction 
in one case will not serve in another to keep to 
our old example — can any form of words suf 
ficiently concise to be recognised by common 
sense as a definition be devised which shall at 
once show how man is to be distinguished fironi 
spirits good and bad and from other incorporeal 
agencies and the point at which he parts com 
pany with the brute creation or regarding that 
physical structure which he has in common with 
brutes will sum up the features of resemblance 
and those of difference which he exhibits when 
compared with such collateral classes as the lion 
and the hare and his relation to such more distant 
classes as the eagle and the ostrich or further 
still to the oyster and the crab what an entire 
confiision would necessarily result firom the at 
tempt to bring befre the mind at once all these 
various points of contrast by one course only 
can we avoid it man must be defined in one 
way if we would see his place in the spiritual 

m 



 on classification and definition 

world in another if we would regard him in his 
relation to good and evil in a third if he is viewed 
relatively to the idea of life in many other cases 
a like difficulty is evident which must be met in 
the same manner we should feel a misgiving if 
called upon suddenly to define feldspar for in 
stance or the diamond the reason probably is 
that we should be doubting how to attempt the 
definition whether we should view them as 
minerals or bring them under chemistry — consult 
their crystallography or their analysis and the 
mind seems quite at a loss and set afloat on a wide 
sea of speculation when called on to define some 
conception which does not fall naturally under 
any formed science in the absence of a true 
science of esthetics we feel that it is vain to 
attempt a true definition of the sublime or the 
beautifiil 

one remark remains to be made on this part 
of the subject it has been said above that a 
conception may have as many definitions as there 
are ideas under which it falls we will now 
observe that it may have more the same idea 
may be developed by means of difierent subordinate 
conceptions which will lead of course to dif 
ferent classifications and therefore to different 
definitions linnaeiis and suvier both bring 
man under the genus mammalia though the 
one finds his differentia in the number of his 
incisor and molar teeth the other in his possession 



on classification and definition 

of hands aristotle who makes his genus biped 
completes the definition by distinguishing him 
from birds either by the absence of wings or 
which comes to nearly the same thing the restric 
tion of his motions to this vile earth we tread on 
if each of these accoimts of man distinguishes 
him with sufiicient accuracy from other animals 
none of them can well be called an incorrect 
definition yet one of them will of course be 
superior to the others this superiority depends 
on the respective merits of the classification 
employed and that classification is to be pre 
ferred in which the idea and the lowest con 
ceptions are connected by the most appropriate 
intermediate generalisations what constitutes 
such appropriateness it is not hard in a general 
manner to see those have the advantage which 
while they apply with sufiicient obviousness to the 
lowest conceptions flow at the same time most 
naturally from the idea by their flowing natu 
rally from the idea is meant that either reason 
shows a priori their connection with it or observa 
tion and experiment abundantly establish the same 
fact k posteriori thus in geometry the division 
of geometrical magnitudes into those of one two 
and three dimensions is natural on the former 
account finite space implying possible measure 
ment and length breadth and thickness being 
obviously the three aspects of space which 
admit of measurements and cuviers arrange 

m 



 on classification and definition 

ment of animals according to the nature of their 
respiratory and circulating apparatus is an ex 
ample of the latter kind it being amply proved 
by observation that according to the perfection of 
the organs of respiration and circulation the 
various functions of animal life are more or less 
perfectly performed 

it is evident that a definition may in this man 
ner be reduced to those dimensions which custom 
and reason have allowed it and very frequently 
to its ideal perfection of form in which it consists 
only of two words one of which is the genus and 
the other the differentia for supposing a class 
to be viewed thus relatively to an idea it is not 
necessary in order to distinguish it from other 
classes which refer to the same idea to enumerate 
all the attributes with which we know it is invested 
we only need to draw the line of demarcation 
clearly between it and those other classes and 
this will be done if we show first of all how it is 
related to them in the way of resemblance which 
is expressed by genus and then how it is dis 
tinguished from them by certain peculiarities 
which is expressed by differentia all its other 
constant attributes come in as properties its 
inconstant as accidents and those only which 
are prominent in the scheme of classification 
enter into the definition if for instance to the 
received definition of man as a bimanous mammal 
it be objected that many other attributes 



on classification and dejinition lt 

besides those of being viviparous and possessing 
hands are necessary to our conception of man 
such as reason imagination the erect posture the 
face divine the answer is simply that so far as 
the functions of kfe are concerned these attributes 
are not essential and that the zoologist views 
man with regard to life and to no other idea 
whatsoever linnaeus once went so far as to 
describe the ourangoutang as homo simius and 
the practical inconvenience of such a definition 
would not have been sufficient to overthrow it 
if the physical structure of the brute had borne 
out as it did not the correctness of the classifica 
tion indeed at present it may be doubted with 
some plausibility whether the word man as 
employed in different sciences always indicates 
precisely the same individuals thus an idiot is 
to the moralist no man and one theory of capital 
punishment assumes that the culprit by the com 
mission of atrocious crime ceases to possess social 
rights in other words to be a man in the sense of 
the political science if this be true the body of 
the criminal who has been executed would never 
theless be that of a man for every purpose of the 
naturalist 

but there is still room for objection left it 
may be argued that supposing the definition to be 
restricted to one idea it may still be a very long 
aflfair indeed the above definition of man for 
instance does not express all his attributes which 



 on classification and definition 

have reference to life why should his prehensile 
organs be held to have such reference if those of 
locomotion are excluded the fact of his having 
two hands either has no connection with the idea 
of life or if it has must impart a share of that 
honour to the fact of his having feet also 

in spite of this objection our definition of man 
may stand it is valid if it marks him off from 
every other class of animal whatsoever if we are 
prepared to say as we are that every animal 
which is viviparous and has two hands and two 
only is entitled to the name of man 

this seems the place to consider another ob 
jection to which this plan of concise definition is 
liable it has been argued that a definition which 
does not enumerate all the attributes of a class 
but only such as are assumed to be distinctive 
though long accepted and approved may fail at 
last and be convicted of falsehood a bimanous 
mammal it is urged may hereafter be discovered 
which shall be formed in some respects on quite 
a different type fiom man and to which we should 
refuse the name though consistency would urge 
us to grant it neither is it sufficient taking 
another point of view to define him as a rational 
animal because it is said we should not grant the 
name of a man to a fish or a quadruped which 
was found to possess reason 

we might reply to such instances as these that 
definition is grounded on classification which con 



on classification and definition 

templates only existing things and that it is hard 
therefore to object to it that it neglects the 
creatures of imagination and makes no grave 
provision for nonentities but this would be 
only to evade the difficulty cases something 
like the imaginary examples given above actually 
occur existing systems of classification are occa 
sionally broken into by apparent anomalies which 
are stubborn facts nevertheless and must ulti 
mately have a place found them the answer 
which fairly meets the case will also bring for 
ward another view of our subject 

definition does not with whatever it deals 
actually give knowledge it provides for the dis 
tinctness not the discovery of truth it has no 
alchemical power of turning dross into gold but 
serves as a touchstone by applying which to the 
individual we may ascertain the extent of our 
general information on the matter in hand we 
shall soon discover this if we make a few attempts 
which are by no means unprofitable as intellectual 
exercises at defining we shall find that if we 
fail it is often not so much fiom ignorance of the 
conception we wish to define as from our insuf 
ficient acquaintance with the classes from which 
we would distinguish it a man possessing the 
most thorough acquaintance with the ingredients 
and properties and uses of coal could not there 
fore define it he might describe it at length but 
this we have seen would be no logical definition 



 on classification and definition 

if he attempted to select one or two distinguishing 
attributes he would most likely fail in the attempt 
because he was ignorant not of the substance 
itself but of the other substances from which it is to 
be distinguished to be successfiil he must know 
not only the mineral in question but other mine 
rals also and a science of mineralogy as well 

as then we can only classify phenomena which 
we know so we can only define on the supposition 
that such classification is correct and based on a 
sufiicient observation of phenomena the defini 
tion of man can only distinguish him from all 
other known animals or all other known rational 
beings according to the probability that other 
rational beings or other animals in many respects 
resembling him have or have not escaped our 
observation will be the probability that a defini 
tion which is certainly valid in the existing state 
of our knowledge will or will not continue valid 
hereafter 

we are now close upon the great point of 
difference between the ancient and modem views 
of definition we have seen that it is a conse 
quence of regarding definition as relative to an 
idea to hold that though it imphes knowledge it 
does not give it he who can define well must be 
master of his subject and to one who had not at 
least a general acquaintance with it his words 
would convey no meaning only the proficient 
can give a definition only the advanced pupil 



on classification and definition 

can follow it suppose for instance a hearer to 
have no system of classification under which the 
diamond falls or a diflferent one from that employed 
by him who defines it the definition will be 
unmeaning to him in the former case it will seem 
inelegant irregular or possibly even wrong in the 
latter 

this would not be the case if definition were 
as it was supposed to be absolute to define a 
conception would not be in that case to assign it 
a place in relation to a particular science but to 
state its gradation in the great scale of things 
definition would not appeal to a classification with 
which students only were supposed to be acquainted 
but would regard all things by the common light 
of human nature on this hypothesis it would be 
intelligible to one who had no antecedent ac 
quaintance with the subject thus definition was 
formerly considered as one actual source of know 
ledge fresh information was to be extracted 
from it by means of the syllogistic apparatus by 
its aid the imperfections of sense were to be 
remedied and science carried beyond the sphere 
of observation and hence the importance formerly 
attached to the rule which commanded that every 
definition should be composed of two parts each 
in itself better known than the thing defined 

there was a very intelligible sense attached to 
the phrase in question those things were better 
known in themselves though probably less known 



 on classification and definition 

to us which were more universal they held a 
higher place in the deductive scheme and ap 
proached nearer to those summary laws of nature 
on which lower laws were foimded thus they 
were more cognisable by reason just as things less 
universal were more cognisable by sense and 
therefore the rule above given might be put in 
other words as follows — the genus and differentia 
must each of them be more universal than the 
species to be defined 

this rule is evidently binding in the case of 
genus if as we have said above it expresses the 
attributes common to the group of collateral 
classes of which the species is one nor is it hard 
to see the reason of aristotle ad the school 
men after him for making the same demand with 
regard to differentia they intended as it has 
been observed that the definition should give 
knowledge this it was to do by enabling the 
mind to combine two conceptions which it had 
entertained previously into a new conception just 
as in syllogism from the two premises we draw a 
conclusion which while it requires both is distinct 
from either it would not be difficult to shew 
that this view assigns a power to the hiunan mind 
which it does not really possess of combining its 
conceptions according to some certain and in 
variable law two conceptions may indeed be 
added mechanically one to another but we can 
no more predict in metaphysic what will result 



on classification and definition 

from their intimate union than we can feretel in 
chemistry how the appearance and properties of 
a protoxide will be altered by its combination 
with another volimie of oxygen in either case 
we may make happy guesses but we have no guide 
to which we can trust implicitly nothing beyond 
that tact in perceiving analogies and so anticipating 
consequences which experience developes if it 
does not give and the conclusions of which in 
their most perfect form cannot if unsupported 
from without rank very high m the scale of pro 
babihty 

but putting considerations of this kind aside it 
is clear that if a definition is in accordance witii 
this hjrpothesis to give knowledge it must be 
made up of conceptions each wider than the 
class to be defined for if either of its parts be 
only coextensive with the class no new range 
will be gained by the mind which must still be 
fettered by the limits of observation on this 
theory for instance it would be unsatisfactory to 
define man by his having two hands whence it 
may be asked has the mind derived this concep 
tion of bimanous since nothing except man is 
twohanded it can only be from man himself so 
the definition is not really exphcative because in 
order to understand it we must be acquainted 
with man who is its subject we may define him 
as an animal with two feet and without plumage 
and escape this objection for though no other 



 



d on tslasslfication and definition 

animal be both twofooted and destitute of plumage 
we may derive each of these notions animal biped 
and featherless from other sources than man 

in modem enquiries where definition stands 
not as the soxrrce but as the registry of our 
knowledge no such restriction is required we 
are content that the genus shall be often co 
extensive with the species unambitious of exer 
cising the dangerous privilege of combining con 
ceptions independently of experience we only 
claim that the differentia be as clear and as 
universal as the class defined and seek neither 
greater clearness nor a wider universality 

we have confined our considerations hitherto to 
purely logical definition we have seen that in 
order to sustain its pretensions at all it must allow 
them to be considerably narrowed in no suflscient 
sense does it state the natiure of the thing defined 
it implies no attempt at exhausting the attributes 
of its subject this it views not as it is in itself 
but only in its relation to a certain idea neither 
do all the attributes which can be shown to refer 
to the idea enter into the definition those only 
are there admitted on which the place of the 
conception with reference to the idea turns — 
those only in other words which enter into the 
scheme of classification thus it is not quite 
correct to say that a logical division expresses the 
analysis of a conception it is grounded on such 
an analysis but does not wholly express it we 



on classification and definition 

take an individual and reject those attributes 
which belong to it as such being thus rid of 
the accidents we have gained the conception of 
the species of this the attributes divide into 
those which have direct reference to the idea 
under which it falls as entering into the scheme 
of classification and those which have not of 
these the former portioned out into genus and 
diflferentia compose the definition the latter 
take their place under the stricter or looser senses 
of property 

it would be foreign to our present purpose to 
speak of definitions other than logical sufiice 
it to say that from logical definition they derive 
their name in virtue of a likeness and analogy 
more or less cogent but they are wholly un 
scientific and are useful only as suggestive or as 
affording raw material so to speak for further 
speculation thus physical definition is a con 
junction of words which has almost if not quite 
disappeared from our ordinary phraseology it 
signifies only an enumeration of all the attributes 
of the class defined so far as they are known 
without any selection or scientific arrangement 
or grouping under an idea it is therefore prior 
to classification as logical definition is posterior 
to it and from its indiscriminate mass the natu 
ralist selects what is fitted for his purpose to 
use a distinction of lord bacons it belongs not 
to physic but to natural history thus it 



 on classification and definition 

follows the analogy of logical definition in being 
grounded on an analysis but here it is the thing 
which we analyse and not the conception 

nominal definition has held its place but by 
a very doubtful title its exact nature logical 
writers find it hard to state the most consistent 
view of it is also the simplest and that which rests 
on the most ancient authorities we define a 
thing nominally when we show or rather attempt 
to show its nature by examining the etymological 
formation of the word by which we commonly 
express it this also is evidently named from the 
analogy of logical definition being founded on an 
analysis not however of the conception but of 
the word though often highly suggestive it can 
seldom be trusted unless we are prepared to allow 
that in forming compoimd words men have always 
regarded the most fundamental and permanent 
features of the objects to which they applied them 
to the exclusion of those which are fleeting and 
superficial 

of all the spurious species of definition that 
which is called accidental or in one word de 
scription is at once of most common use and least 
nearly related to its logical prototjrpe without 
any attempt at analysis it merely takes those 
attributes of the class which appear most salient 
and characteristic and calls attention to them as 
marks by which it may be recognised quite inde 
pendently of its relation to other classes 



on classification and definition 

these few remarks on the secondary kinds of 
definition are a digression from our main subject 
but they may be usefrd in showing that one 
species only is recognised by science that of this 
all others are more or less imitations and that 
in every case scientific and logical definition 
coincide 

one possible diflsculty attendant on the previous 
views still remains to be obviated it may be 
objected to the practical working of this scheme 
of relative definition that it reduces all sciences 
to a dead level and destroys their real distinctions 
as to dignity and importance has man as such 
it may be asked no definition is it of no 
consequence whether we view him as mortal or 
immortal in his relation to the animal kingdom 
or to the spiritual world logic will do little 
service if it thus violates commonsense and 
overleaps a diflference which we observe in every 
day life 

a little care in drawing a necessary distinction 
will serve to meet this diflsculty suppose the 
same thing to be defined in reference to several 
ideas it follows that each definition may be 
equally correct but not of course equally im 
portant as the ideas themselves rise and fall in 
dignity so will the classifications and definitions 
which are founded on them thus the value to be 
attached to the several definitions will depend not 
on the degree of their correctness for all may be 



 on classification and definition 

equally correct but on the comparative promi 
nence of the ideas — a subject which shall be 
mentioned though not discussed at the conclusion 
of this essay 



chap x 

on the gradations of science 

we will now once more recapitulate the com 
mon features which are possessed by all the 
sciences in the first place each of them is 
grounded on an idea next under this idea is 
ranked a multitude of conceptions thirdly 
these conceptions have amongst each other an 
order and arrangement in which constant re 
ference is had to the idea foiuthly beside this 
order and arrangement which either tends to or 
amounts to classification there is some aim at and 
appearance of deductiveness and consequentiality 
wherever formal deduction and strict conse 
quence are firom the nature of the case impossible 

thus much for the common features of sciences 
in general they will be indirectly illustrated yet 
further in the following remarks which are in 
tended however to answer directly a different 
purpose and to mark not the similarity but the 
distinction of sciences not their uniformity but 
their gradations 

the highest place in the scale is of coiuse as 
signed to pure science of this we take geometry 

n 



 on the gradations of science 

as the type its peculiar and characteristic excel 
lency is its entire dependence on its idea 

the idea in this case once given all the 
science necessarily follows it is the nucleus 
round which all that is homogeneous with it 
clusters by a natural law when once space is 
conceived by the mind mere cogitation without 
the aid of experience would be able to draw from 
this idea the conceptions of lines surfaces and 
solids and all the various species of these which 
the science of geometry recognises the prin 
ciples of classification also are here exemplified 
they only escape attracting our attention by 
appearing in so natural and obvious a form it 
has been said above that on classification follows 
definition here accordingly a good classifica 
tion lies at the very base of the science and a 
corresponding series of accurate definitions follows 
it we begin pure science by defining in other 
words we commence by positing our species and 
stating their genus and difference that result 
at which as we shall see presently lower forms of 
science aim is attained before the main labour of 
pure science begins 

being thus furnished with an idea and the 
subordinate conceptions and the system of clas 
sification we apply ourselves to our new work 
that of drawing consequences and the con 
sequentiality is here as perfect as all that has 
preceded it there is ilo gap between our data 



on the gradations of science 

and our ultimate conclusions the necessary 
laws of inference when applied to the definitions 
axioms and postulates enable us to invest our 
species with properties before unknown squares 
triangles circles become no clearer as we ad 
vance for they were accurately defined before we 
began our researches but they do become fuller 
conceptions as they are associated in our minds 
with fresh atlributes and all these attributes are 
properties they are proved to be inseparably 
connected with the several classes though not 
taken into consideration in forming them in 
this most perfect sphere of speculation accidents 
have no place 

such then are the distinctive excellencies of 
pure science it possesses the highest unity 
being simply the development of a single idea 
it begins with a perfect classification and following 
on this with accurate and perfect definitions 
but these merits are comparatively eclipsed by its 
most distinguishing excellency an exact isind per 
fect consequentiality from first to last it flows 
in one direction from the idea downwards there 
 no appeal to experience— no desire of confirm 
ation from without — no endeavour when the feict 
has been derived from one quarter to find the 
reason in another every unk of the chain of 
knowledge holds and wherever the process stops 
short it is as far as it goes perfect having perhaps 
an unfinished air but still enduring even in this 

n 



 on the gradations of science 

intermediate form and capable of addition without 
alteration 

next in place of dignity to pure science come 
the applied sciences of these we have before 
taken mechanics as an example here too we 
have an idea and a number of conclusions flowing 
from certain data according to a necessary con 
 sequence but the applied sciences are in 
ferior to the preceding class in one important 
particular they have not the same absolute 
unity their main principles though closely 
connected with the idea need not be deductions 
from it mere phases and aspects in which it 
exhibits itself anew they often need independ 
ent proof and rest upon the testimony of ex 
perience thought alone could not have extracted 
them from the idea no one by only pondering 
the nature of force could arrive at the knowledge 
of the laws of motion thus there is an interval 
so to speak in the applied sciences between the 
idea and the subordinate principles which ex 
cludes them from perfect unity lowers the student 
from the sphere of pure abstraction brings him to 
the borderland of the intellectual and sensible 
and introduces the contrast though not in its 
hardest outline between form and matter thus 
the province of reason is somewhat narrowed 
and that of experience expands 

jn this respect their practical application answers 
to their theory though the further they are 



on the gradations of science 



ii 



pressed the more power they display though they 
admit in practice of a minute elaboration to an 
extent which beforehand would be simply in 
credible though they transcend the limits of 
observation and become prophetic at the time to 
derive afterwards fresh credit from the verification 
of their predictions yet one important part of 
their office is to account for the past this is 
seldom the case with pure science that for the 
most part gives at once the fact and the reason 
it does not usually derive the knowledge of a truth 
from some extraneous sorurce and then account 
for it in virtue of certain known laws but from 
these laws reaches out to new propositions which 
but for it would have remained unknown not 
so the applied sciences which have generally in 
all their provinces to account for facts which are 
known from observation and other independent 
sources before they are trusted in the field where 
reason supersedes sense and takes a free flight 
beyond the regions of experiment 

but if the applied sciences be thus deficient in 
unity a more serious objection lies against the 
next class of sciences which we call classificatory 
of these we may take botany as an example 
they have indeed a sufficiently perfect unity of 
idea every fact of botany for instance bears 
naturally on the idea of vegetable life the mind 
is never in suspense never seems wandering from 
its subject all the conceptions group themselves 



 on the gradations of science 

whether readily or not at least with obvious 
reference to a single purpose and therefore the 
classificatory sciences exhibit in thdr fullest 
perfection the system of classification and the 
practical use of the predicables accidents are 
not excluded from their cognisance as in the 
hier forms of science varieties for instance 
or those modifications of the species which are not 
necessarily permanent though they seb prac 
tically to be so the habitat of a plant or its 
oeconomic uses though confessedly accidents find 
their place in a botanical treatke definition 
also is perfectly exhibited though its position here 
is very different from that which it occupies in 
pure science there as we have seen the species 
are first defined and then certain attributes which 
we ai once recognise as properties either in 
the stricter or looser sense of the term are afiblsed 
to them by the process of inference in tiie 
classificatory sdences we bn at the other 
extreme a mass of attributes is placed before 
us we have to arrange them in such a manner 
as to determine what constitute the class in other 
words enter into its definition and what do not 
and those attributes which fall under the latter 
head according as they are permanent or not 
are distributed into the remaining classes of 
property and accident 

but the great deficiency of these sciences in 
spite of their combining correct classification and 



on the aradations of science 

diyision with a sufficient unity lies in their lac of 
consequentiality let the facts be arranged in 
the best possible manner the principle of cohesion 
is still wanted the facts must be tgken on trust 
they bear little or no evidence to their own truth 
they resemble when icornbined some piece of 
mosaic work which must be held together by a 
frame or it would fall to pieces they require 
the check of evidence and the support of observa 
tion in geometry no position of euclid can be 
ignored or doubted by one who has paid due 
attention to the treatise without his exposing him 
self to the charge of folly or wilfulness in the 
applied sciences when certain premises are granted 
all doubt as to the sequel is put out of the question 
bujt in mineralogy or botany each separate asser 
tion admits of dispute the proof of any one will 
not serve to establish any other all the internal 
evidence of the truth of a system lies in the 
natural air of its details and the consistency of it 
general features 

is there then it may be askejji no consequent 
tiajiity in the classificatory sciences may we 
ikt say here as well as in mathematics that the 
properties are traceable to the nature of the species 
as eifect to cause when fojr instance monocoty 
ledonous plants are found to be endogens while 
dicotyledonous plants are expgens may we not 
say that these modes of growth are consequences 
respectively of the siiqgle and double cotyledon 



 on th£ gradations of sci£nck 

we answer in the first place that while it would 
be rash to deny all consequentiality to the classifi 
catory sciences we may safely assert that when 
compared to the previous kinds of sciences they 
prove in this respect greatly deficient it is certain 
that we have here no such knowledge of the laws 
of consequence as to enable us to predict results 
no one could have told a priori that mono 
cotyledonous plants are endogens no one can 
venture safely on like predictions hereafter all 
attempts at anticipation on such subjects must 
depend on analogies which often fail and can 
never be more than probable evidence so that 
at best consequentiality shows itself here in its 
lowest form we must be abimdantly content if 
having traced our facts first we can discover the 
reasons afterwards 

we should further observe that it is by no 
means the same thing to be sure that consequence 
exists that two phenomena are connected as cause 
and effect and to be able to investigate the stages 
of the consequence to have the history so to 
speak of the causality one phenomenon may 
invariably so far as om observation goes follow 
and attend upon another and yet we may perceive 
such a gap in the nature of things between them 
as may serve to convince us that there must be 
some remote law as yet perhaps undiscovered on 
which their connection depends to take our 
former example thus much seems clear that 



on the gradations of science i 

endogenous growth is the consequence of the pre 
sence of but one cotyledon but the fact of the 
consequence does not explain its mystery its law 
is still unknown admitting that the phenomena 
do accompany each other we enquire why and at 
present in vain 

we may now briefly state the sum of the previous 
remarks on the gradations of science pure 
science we have seen is the type which unites 
perfections elsewhere separate and in which unity 
of structure and complete classification meet with 
perfect consequence in the applied sciences the 
consequence when the premises are once given 
may be as perfect but the unity is of a lower kind 
and depends less entirely on the idea the clas 
sificatory sciences have a unity nearly as perfect 
as that of pure science vnth a classification as 
perfect and of yet wider range but here the 
parts are bound together by a loose tie and the 
scientific mind regrets the absence of consequen 
tiality 

one observation remains to be made at this part 
of our subject sciences are sometimes compli 
cated observation and reason go together to 
make up the whole an inductive process which 
is mainly one of classification is to be gone through 
before the premises are gained fiom which the 
deduction begins and this process is not always 
in the less exact sciences considered as antecedent 
to the science but sometimes as a part of it thus in 



 on the gradations of science 

harmonics the relation of the number of vibrations to 
sound though a matter of experiment is recognised 
as part of the science though it serves mainly as 
the preliminary to other parts which deduce hence 
the laws of harmony and discord as dependent on 
number 

sciences like these take their place according to 
their predomiiumt element we must analyse 
them and rank them higher or lower as the £m 
pirical or the rational preponderates 

there is another class of compound sciences 
such as geology and especially of late astronomy 
which assume another form first of all a certain 
set of phenomena are collected and arranged a 
number of truths are gained by inference observ 
atipn or both so far the ordinary procedure of 
science is observed we state after due consider 
ation what is true at present but another class 
of questions soon comes in we ask what condi 
tions of tlungs in past time these present truths 
presuppose these are some of the most intereist 
ing problems connected with science who is not 
anxious to know what we can lawfully infer as to 
the jstate of the earth in past ages fiom the present 
ts of its stratification an organic remains — how 
£ax celestial phenomena make the nebular hypo 
thesis probable — and whether the optical properties 
of the diamond oblige us to assign it a vegetable 
origin 

in cases of this kind it is with the present phe 



on the gradations of science 

nomena that science in the strict sense deals in 
attaining or arranging these it occupies itself the 
further queries resulting henee in deciding which 
we must infer what has been formerly from what 
is now do not belong properly to scientific method 
there is here no subordination and arrangement 
but only a question as to the practical connection 
of fact with fact we can only ask — does the 
existing state of this necessitate the belief that 
another economy difiering in certain given respeetsj 
existed at a certain given time our acts are as 
so many witnesses in a court of justice to decide 
whether they prove their point appertains not to 
scientific method but to the ordinary laws of 
evidence

on method in art 

we should wander far from the direct line of 
our enquiry were we to allow ourselves to enter 
fiilly on the place of method in art it would be 
no trifling undertaking to attempt an analysis 
of the rapid glance of invention or the cooler 
exertion of the critical faculty the comparative 
inexactness of method in this province gives a 
wider scope for speculation concerning it the 
two great divisions of art the mechanical and the 
sesthetical might put in separate claims for dis 
cussion we should have to assign due place and 
proportion to the skill which adapts means to ends 
the fine taste which discriminates results the 
broad general theories of beauty and fitness which 
the artist is supposed often unconsciously to obey 
we might wander freely on the enchanted ground 
but should soon find ourselves far from the do 
minion of logic 

our task with regard both to art and to 
morality which in this point of view is closely 
connected with it is of a much simpler nature 
we are to avoid entering unnecessarily on their 



on method in art 

peculiarities and content ourselves with consider 
ing those features in which their procedure is 
identical with or stands in intimate relation to the 
logical method of science 

art then like science has to consider the 
relations of certain conceptions to an idea there 
can be no true art when an idea is altogether 
absent there may be much empirical skill great 
accuracy in imitation close observation of detail 
but no genius invention or originality 

yet on the other hand there seems to be truth 
in the position that art does not deal with ideas 
its work is the production of actual individual 
things it seems to wander beyond iti province 
and confound itself as the case may be with 
mechanics or ibsthetics or some narrower science 
when it quits individuals and meddles with prin 
ciples at all 

these two sides of truth may thus be reconciled 
art has indeed to do with individual things but 
each of these will fall not under one idea only 
but under several will bear a definite relation to 
them and be capable of receiving illustration from 
them in other words the subject of a single 
art lies within the sphere of several sciences 
and it cannot be expedient to neglect the light 
which methodized knowledge may thus cast upon 
it these sciences can be made practically useful 
if knowledge is really power and how are they 
to be brought to bear not surely in an irregular 



ipo on method in art 

and desultory manner this would be a con 
tradiction of their nature the several sciences 
which claim so much order and arrangement in 
their respective provinces cannot be in a state of 
anarchy among themselves one science will be 
dominant above the rest and the idea of that 
science will be the idea of the art 

must then the idea on which an art is founded 
be necessarily a scientific idea it would seem 
not after all the attention that has been devoted 
to the philosophy of fine arts a real science of 
ibsthetic has never been attained we have not 
been able to state satisfactorily in a deductive form 
the nature of the beautiful but though the 
science has been absent the art has gone on it 
is sufficient that there is no antecedent impossibility 
of such an expansion of the iesthetical idea mean 
while art has lost little of its dignity and nothing 
of its unity though it has continued deficient in 
certainty comparatively little faith has been 
shown in general rules and more reliance neces 
sarily placed in the individual sense of the beauti 
ful 

art then being like science conversant both 
with conceptions and ideas it is natural to enquire 
to what kind of science it is most closely analogous 
in its perfect form it approaches closely to the 
applied sciences to the type of pure science it 
cannot at all approximate its constant appeal t 
the outward world and experience its endeavours 



on method in art ll 

to meet particular wants and gratify particular 
senses separate it clearly from the range of k 
priori truth the empirical element though not 
always equally prominent must be always present 
and if we can trace in art as we can in applied 
science not only the subordination of the con 
ceptions to the idea but the reason of that sub 
ordination our approximation to scientific con 
sistency is so much the closer yet such syste 
matic completeness is quite unnecessary for prac 
tical purposes and it is only when we can bring 
the laws of number to bear on our subject that it 
can be really obtained in other cases we may 
well rest content with the same comparatively 
vague notions of consequence which we have 
observed to exist in the classificatory sciences it 
will suffice us to infer from the unity of sequence 
that it takes place in virtue of a law of causation 
without pretending to discover how that law 
operates 

we shall soon have occasion in treating of 
analysis and synthesis to mention some points in 
which art and science are differently related to 
logic meanwhile there seems a necessity for a 
few remarks on the relation with regard to method 
of morality to science 



chap xi i 

on method in morality 

morality may stand to method in two different 
relations between which it is important for our 
present purpose to distinguish in the first place 
it may be viewed as a science — that great science 
of human conduct in general which enters into 
the springs of action and the intellect and feelings 
so far as they concern action in this sense it 
forms the basis of politics and rhetoric and to some 
extent even of poetry and the fine arts as well as 
of morality in that second sense which shall be 
mentioned presently but important though it 
be it needs no separate discussion of its method 
being in fact a classificatory science more ele 
vated in its character indeed than any other of its 
class and as it deals with internal rather than 
external phenomena proportionably more difiicult 
of attainment but still conforming to the same 
laws and arriving at its results by a similar 
process morality in its second and lower aspect 
is subject to the same conditions of logical method 
as art it might indeed be defined as the art 
of right action did not common usage restrict art 



on mkthod in morality 

to a narrower range and assign to it some definite 
end short of the perfection of human conduct in 
general assuming then that its method is broadly 
the same as that of other arts we will mention a 
few peculiarities which are intimately connected 
with its nature 

it is then closely allied to those arts which are 
grounded on some elevated idea not as yet made 
the subject of a perfect science there is no 
commonly recognised and admitted science of 
goodness no system of arranging those phe 
nomena of human conduct which we call good 
on which philosophers in general agree at such 
a system we have seen many elaborate attempts 
but none successful thus the art of morality is 
dignified rather than perfect and where it most 
succeeds in accuracy of detail and practical co 
gency is deficient in theoretic dependence on its 
first principles we allow the connection of the 
phenomena in fact rather than perceive the 
reason in this respect it is closely analogous 
to the fine arts nor can we be surprised at any 
extent to which the parallelism runs when we 
remember the close connection between the ideas 
of goodness and beauty but this art however 
complete could scarcely be of great practical 
utility to those who would become good its 
advantageous exercise implies the full recognition 
of the idea of goodness and in such recognition 
moral excellence is presupposed again we are 

o 



 on method in moralitv 

incapable of using an art aright unless we are 
familiar not only with its rules but with the 
purposes for which it is employed but the art 
of morality aims at producing good action and 
good action philosophically viewed is an internal 
phenomenon which can be known only by our own 
experience and not by observation of others 
therefore to apply the moral art advantageously 
we must be good already 

this seems a paradox but it is not far from the 
truth the art of morality is practically identical 
with that of education he who is acquainted 
with it applies it not to his own case but to that 
of others they are if possible to benefit by his 
experience and attain the same end but by a 
shorter and more direct process 
there is the more occasion for this remark 
because the misapplication of the art in question 
involves considerable danger the object of its 
rules is to enable those for whose benefit they are 
meant to realise more vividly the moral idea in 
general and to attain clearer moral perceptions in 
detail but the knowledge of a rule which they 
think they can obey without hesitation and doubt 
may lead them to neglect the exercise of those 
perceptive and reflective powers by which alone 
they can really apprehend the moral conceptions 
and combine them under the idea in a case of 
this nature the endeavour after systematic culti 
vation may thwart the very tendencies which it 



¦ 



bn metttod in morality ifts 

seemed likely to forward thus a loose and 
imperfect casuistry or any casuistry out of its 
place does harm in the former case it degrades 
the moral sense which adapts itself to its standard 
in the latter case it hinders its operation by seem 
ing to render it unnecessary we should have 
little hope of excellence in a painter who followed 
some general law of beauty which he thought he 
had discovered in spite of the evidence of his eye 
given to the contrary side in like manner we 
cannot hold him to be really good who sacrifices 
to some formula of right and wrong which he 
thinks to contain the truth the unbiassed verdict 
of a reflective and uncorrupted conscience 

what then are the points of resemblance and 
difference with regard to method between art 
and morality on the one hand and science on the 
other we have it has been seen in each an 
idea and conceptions ranged under it we have 
in each as much subordination and consequent 
tiality as the nature of the subject admits but 
in purpose and practical application as well as in 
form there is a strong contrast between them 
all science as such aims mainly at the illustration 
or expansion of its original idea in this de 
ductive and inductive sciences agree thus far 
the same impression is made by the successive 
deductions which follow in geometry from the 
idea of space and the multiplied phenomena 

o 



 on method in morality 

which we group under the idea of life in botany 
or zoology the central unity is brought more 
vividly before the mind by being traced and followed 
through the plurality of detail 

not so with art its everyday work of pro 
duction keeps it from this continual tendency 
towards an ideal centre when the idea can be 
traced in the lower mechanical arts it seems often 
to be merely instrumental and to discharge the 
oflsce so to speak of an intellectual fulcrum 
which may enable us to bring our conceptions to 
bear the better upon practice the critic may 
trace the idea in the conception the artist is 
only careful to illustrate the conception by the 
idea this seems to be true even in the fine 
arts and in morals how little need the artist 
be conscious of that theory of beauty which were 
he a philosopher he would in strict consistency 
adopt and how wholly ignorant are many who 
act in the spirit of the institutions under which 
they live or are pledged to the moral precepts of 
the school in which they are educated of the 
really distinctive features of the system which 
they every day exhibit with sufficient success in 
practice 

one other point of diflference and that not un 
important between the method of art and science 
remains to be mentioned it will find its place in 
the following remarks on the nature and applica 
tion of analysis and synthesis 



chap xiii 

on analysis and synthesis 

we have hitherto considered science and art 
from one point of view only the question before 
us has been what form they assume when they 
have attained comparative perfection the shape 
which they take in earlier stages the process they 
go through on their way to a fiiuer development 
we have scarcely touched upon some remarks 
on this point will bring us well nigh to the close 
of our subject 

the method of attainment is indeed far from 
prominent in science the reason of this is found 
in the very meaning of the term we cannot at 
tach the name of science to any knowledge which 
is confessedly very imperfect both in form and 
matter deficient in its parts and unshapely in its 
proportions the task of elaborating it is in 
cumbent on a very few most men receive it from 
some higher mind which in constructing it 
registered only its successes and results not its 
doubts much less its failures we see only the 



 on analysis and synthesis 

 

finished work not the rough side of the tapestry 
and thus though science of course implies a 
previous process it does not suggest it to the 
common observer or call his attention to it 

it is very different with art which as we have 
ien„ seldom if ever attains this pitch of systematic 
perfection at bestj it is struggling towards the 
type itself not the highest of applied science 
here we are obliged to contemplate tendencies as 
well as results the nature and direction of mental 
effort as distinct from that which it effects the 
more soj because art cannot like science afford 
 wait in order to gain system it is needed as 
bearing directly on the actual work of life it is 
p tool for certain purposes which must be used when 
its purposes require if it be not perfect we must 
take it as we find it we gladly use the indifferent 
physician who is at hand while we dispatch the 
messenger to simunon some more skilfril leech 
from a distance in art then the method of 
discovery is almost always as prominent as that of 
perfect statement and often much more so 

it is this vfhich is commonly expressed by the 
formula that science is synthetical and art 
analytical — a formula which in its bearings on 
our subject will require some explanation and 
the first step towad this is to assign to the terms 
analysis and synthesis a definite and accurate 
gleaning 

one ordinary manner of explaining them 



j on analysis and synthesis 

though true on the whole is not satisfactory 
according to this view all reasoning from part to 
whole is synthesis all reasoning from whole to 
part is analysis and this explanation talues 
sufficiently well with the common use of the terms 
its imperfection is that practically it is apt to 
become indefinite our notions of whole and 
part are liable to vary genus is a whole in one 
received sense and species in another thus 
the distinction between analysis and synthesis is 
made to rest on the uncertain foundation of a 
ghifting meaning but it seems unwise to leave 
the force of words so commonly received liable to 
a sudden inversion and to oblige them to share 
the ambiguity of other terms with which they 
jiave not any obvious connection 

perhaps we shall find here our best guide to the 
strict truth in following a metaphor for me 
taphors we must use in describing intellectual 
operations our only choice lies between using them 
in an ignorant and unguarded and a conscious and 
careftil manner what then is the source of the 
figure by which analysis and synthesis are applied 
to acts of the mind if we regarded the present 
only we should be apt to answer from the science 
of chemistry but the history of the terms obliges 
us to look for their origin further back in the 
language of the ancient mathematics 

analysis according to the old mathematicians 



 on analysis and synthesis 

was the exact reverse of synthesis to which it 
was meant to minister it was the indirect method 
by which a knowledge of the direct process of 
proof was gained supposing our object to be 
to establish the truth of a certain theorem or 
to discover the manner of solving a problem we 
begin according to the analytical method by 
assuming that the theorem is true or the problem 
possible of solution without this primary as 
sumption the analysis could not proceed but 
this being granted the question follows — what 
other suppositions are involved in supposing this 
theorem to be true or this problem to be possible 
in the answer to this question the analytical 
process lies we regard the assumption we have 
made as implying certain prior assumptions these 
are again perceived to depend on certain more 
elementary positions and so we trace the chain 
of consequence backward till we arrive at those 
data which the science with which we are at 
present concerned presupposes as its foundation 
the analysis is then complete and the synthesis 
forthwith begins 

we have here supposed the analytical process 
to terminate in success this of course need not 
happen our original assumption may have been 
wrong or if not absolutely and certainly false 
it may be wholly incapable of being established by 
the aid of the science which we have endeavoured 



on analysis and synthesis 

to bring to bear upon it in the former case if 
we proceed far enough the analysis will suddenly 
be brought to a stand we shall find ourselves 
involved in the contradiction of some axiom or 
other fundamental position of the science we have 
been employing in the latter case the process 
may be continued till we arrive at certain posi 
tions of which a further analysis is impossible 
and these will prove not to be data of the science 
with which we are dealing they may be very 
possibly propositions the truth or falsehood of 
which we may not be able to ascertain and our 
investigation will then have arrived at no satis 
factory termination 

but supposing the analysis to be successful 
the synthesis follows as a matter of course the 
connection between our assumption and the data 
of the science holds but it is viewed from the 
contrary extreme the same truth is now built 
on a sure foundation which before was poised for 
the time so to speak in a vacmun the same 
steps are taken forward in certainty which were 
taken backward in doubt and thus the whole 
field which we have traversed in enquiry we 
traverse again in proof 

we can now see the especial propriety of taking 
our explanation of analysis from this ancient 
source rather than from more modem quarters 
for it enables us to regard pure science as 
supplying the perfect type of analysis as well as 



 on analysis ani synthesis 

of synthesis its hrpothetical character more 
over is thus most strongly brought before us 
whenever we are prepared ultimately to rest the 
proof of our position on pure deduction it appears 
that no induction is necessary before making the 
assumption which the analysis presupposes facts 
may suggest this assumption but we do not expect 
them to prove it if it be based at last on any 
other evidence than that of the deductive process 
itself it can only be in a secondary sense a de 
ductive conclusion it is not pure science but 
science in a lower form which accounts for facts 
which are known to be true already on evidence 
other than its own 

thus we are led to observe that the analytical 
process is hypothetical exactly in the same pro 
portion as the corresponding synthetical process 
is certain and complete in itself it was in all 
probability at first an unproved assumption on the 
part of pythagoras that the square of the hypo 
thenuse of a rightangled triangle is equal to the 
square of the two remaining sides he had seen 
this equality we may imagine in a single instance 
of a rightangled triangle and supposed that it 
applied to all when the analysis consequent on 
this assumption was attempted the truth of the 
proposition remained doubtful till every link 
between the first principles of geometry and the 
wishedfor result was obtained bijt this chain 
once formed the case was altered each step 



on analysis and synthesis sos 

was certain in itself and a sure basis for what 
followed every intermediate position betweei 
the data and the conclusion as well as the cons 
elusion itself assumed so to speak a new modality 
and from being doubtful and contingent became a 
necessary truth 

in the applied sciences as we descend lower 
the analytical process becomes less perfect here 
we demand greater evidence before we make our 
necessary assumption for the most part indeedj 
though not always we require proof of it as a 
matter of fact the occurrence of any apparently 
exceptional phenomenon does not at once set us 
speculating as a matter of course about its causes 
we rather distrust appearances and if experiment 
can give us information on the subject have re 
course to it that we may learn whether the 
seeming exception is only a mistake of our own 
or if it lie beyond the province of experiment we 
generally wait till time gives fresh opportunities of 
observation and so enables us to form a more 
perfect judgment the many new phenomena of 
light for instance which were discovered by 
chance were carefully tested before philosophers 
endeavoured to account for them here then as 
the synthesis is of a less scientific character the 
corresponding analysis is of a lower order also 
it is no longer the procedure from an uncertainty 
to a certainty but the procedure from one certainty 
through a series of uncertainties to another and a 



 on analysis and synthesis 

prior certainty while the synthesis in like 
manner only gives us for the most part the con 
nection between known laws and certain previously 
known facts without so often enabling us to pre 
dict facts in virtue of their dependence on laws 

it was before observed that the consequentiality 
which in some sense is present in all sciences 
appears in mere classificatory science in a very 
imperfect degree being traceable indeed only by 
the aid of probabilities and general analogy we 
will further remark that they exhibit analysis in 
a like shadowy manner their object is to arrange 
certain phenomena under an idea this is effected 
by means of intermediate generalisations which we 
interpose in order between the idea and the phe 
nomena according to their degree of universality 
but these generalisations are lawftd only so far as 
they tally with the actual facts of nature our 
classes must be such as she by the regular dis 
tribution of their attributes shows that she re 
cognises there is in their connection with each 
other no definite consequentiality which warrants 
us in leaving any step for the time unverified in 
the confidence that it will receive at last sufiicient 
confirmation by being referred to some higher 
truth as its authority each separate step must 
be established by a separate observation thus 
our analysis becomes the faintest image of the 
true analytical process we do not doubt the 
certainty either of the idea or of the facts or of 



on analysis and synthesis 

the intermediate generalisations all that we can 
doubt is their admitting of arrangement in a com 
plete and orderly series and it is this only that 
the analysis enables us to ascertain within this 
comparatively narrow province it still continues 
highly useful we have much more facility iti 
beginning from facts and widening our classes as 
we ascend than in thinking according to the 
synthetical method and narrowing our classes in 
regular gradation from the idea 

it remains to niention the manner in which art 
avails itself of analysis the method of art it will 
be remembered approximates to the type of applied 
science analysis then will hold theoretically 
a similar position in each though the practical 
nature of art has some effect upon its prominence 
and importance 

conscious analysis indeed does not seem very 
common in the fine arts the critic by his 
researches often shows that principles are really 
involved in the works of an artist which the artist 
himself has probably never realised in their ab 
stract form he exemplifies the laws of science 
not in consequence of any intentional study of 
them but in virtue of that taste that perception 
of beauty in the concrete which is developed by 
increased observation and the careful scrutiny of 
particulars 

perhaps in this field the most common use of 
analysis is in investigating the cause of defects 



• on analysis and svnthbsis 

something offends we know not why in the 
endeavour to refer it back to first principles we 
shall discover that some rule has been transgressed 
some harmony violated some canon of consistency 
broken thus very early attempts at art often 
fail at the first touch of analysis they are de 
fective in consistency though the parts may be 
right in themselves on no possible hypothesis 
could the whole be true the same reason is 
fatal to the attempt of a chinese artist to depict 
all six sides of an interior at once and to the 
tonventional egyptian representation of a man 
in which the head body and lower members are 
depicted in three incompatible positions and 
to the head of minerva on the archaic coins of 
athens in which the full eye which figures ap 
propriately in the fiontface is transferred without 
modification to the profile 

in the earlier stages of the fine arts this seems 
to be the only use of analysis even in their most 

 

flourishing state there seems little of that doubt 
and indecision which the analytical process im 
plies great works are owing to the magic of 
genius and not to any formal process of thought 
but when invention waxes cold and thought turns 
less readily to the aspirations of the present than 
to the glories of the past then analysis steps in 
it gives rules according to which art has uncon 
sciously produced certain effects with a view to 
their reproduction and these rules vdll fall under 



bn analysis and synthfesls 

the ideei so far as the nature of the case admits 
according to the ordinary method of science 

it has been before observed that the fine arts 
in the absence of a science of jisthetics do not 
admit of a near approach to the scientific method 
this is not the case with many mechanical arts 
some of these afford an opportunity for strict con 
sequence in the formation of the rules which can 
be deduced ibrom certain empirical principles by 
means of the laws of space and number of this 
nature are many practical applications of the laws 
of hydraulics and pneumatics and projectiles 
here the synthetical arrangement is more than a 
form and the method of art by coinciding with 
its type loses its individuality and melts into that 
of applied science 

our mention of analysis has hitherto been con 
fined to cases in which it is usual when the 
tentative process is complete to adopt the syn 
thetical method of statement as more scientific 
and formal analysis however is not always thus 
subordinate as may be shown by any simple instance 
fiom the analytical mathematics in a common 
algebraic equation one or more unknown quanti 
ties are posited and the consequences are traced 
backward till those quantities become known it 
is not considered necessary to reverse the process 
and so to show that the results attained actually 
fulfil the conditions which the unknown quantities 
were assumed to fulfil in the original formula 



 on analysis and synthesis 

another instance in which analysis is perfect 
without any corresponding synthesis is found in 
the ordinary process of deliberation which has 
sometimes gained in consequence the name of 
practical analysis those who deliberately desire 
any object which they have reason to suppose is 
within their reach begin as the first step towards 
attaining it to posit it as an end of action this 
is of course in most cases a mere assumption 
observation may have shown that the object is 
attainable by some but they cannot be sure 
without previous consideration of particulars that 
it is attainable by them nevertheless they take 
for the time this doubtful point for granted and 
thus make that venture which all analysis in a 
greater or less degree requires the question now 
becomes through what means their end is to be 
attained here the analytical procedure comes 
in they consider what antecedent conditions on 
their part the attainment of this object requires 
and to what conditions these in their turn are 
subject thus they proceed precisely as in ma 
thematical analysis until they arrive at certain 
elementary conditions which their own conscious 
ness tells them are within their powers — certain 
acts of their individual will and the natural expres 
sions of it in word or deed the analysis is perfect 
when the agent can say — if i will and do this as 
i can will and do it all that i desire will follow 
then deliberation ceases and choice begins it 



on analysis and synthesis 

seems better to regard the analytical process in 
this case as complete in itself because the subse 
quent act although reversing the order of the 
thought can scarcely be regarded as answering to 
it as its synthesis it is too different in kind to 
take its place in the same method though the 
desires flow to their end through the channel which 
intellect has shaped for them this does not oblite 
rate the broad differences which distinguish them 
from the intellect itself 



chap xiv 

on the connection of method with formal logic 

particular logical questions have found a 
place only accidentally in the foregoing pages 
we could scarcely descend to detail in considering 
the general relation in which at different times 
logic and science have been thought to stand to 
each other when this disputed point had been 
discussed in its various phases it was natural to 
weigh the subordinate questions which arose from 
the different views concerning it and after 
having determined what opinions both on the 
main subject and on the dependent queries seemed 
to have truth on their side we proceeded to point 
to method as a ground of union for logic and 
science and to pure science especially as the 
common type in which logical and scientific 
method are each most perfectly exhibited 

meanwhile the introduction of even wellknown 
logical terms when they were not absolutely 
necessary has been purposely avoided our object 
was to show the natural tendency of knowledge to 



on the connection of method with formal logic 

fall into a logical form and not the power of the 
human mind to press it by violence into the mould 
of its technicalities but now that our main pur 
pose is fulfilled it may further rather than impede 
the general impression of these pages to observe 
that the apparatus of logic not only shows a fit 
ness for exhibiting particular arguments but dis 
closes differences in its various portions which 
indicate a connection with systematic thought and 
methodical knowledge when considered not as split 
up into a multitude of separated arguments but as 
consistent wholes on this subject we will dwell 
a little in detail 

it is generally allowed by logicians that syllo 
gism as the formal exhibition of the act of the 
mind in reasoning divides itself into three principal 
heads namely the inductive the deductive and 
the hjrpothetical whether these three forms of 
argument are really collateral species of a single 
genus or whether the two latter can be reduced 
without loss of their dignity or derogation firom 
their utility to the type of deductive syllogism is 
a question of considerable interest but not bearing 
directly on our present subject it suffices us 
that for the ordinary purpose of inference the 
three modes of arguing are certainly distinct 

and further it is commonly observed with regard 
to them that deductive syllogism proceeds from 
the law downwards from higher universals to lower 
that induction on the other hand argues from the 



 on the connection of method 

fact to the law from lower universals to higher 
while the hypothetical syllogism ignoring this 
distinction of law and fact only implies that two 
positions are connected as antecedent and con 
sequent so that under the sanction of its own 
peculiar rules the denial or assertion of one in 
volves the denial or assertion of the other without 
any regard to their relative extent or degree of 
universality and of these three forms of in 
ference it is generally allowed that the deductive 
syllogism if it be not the most powerful instru 
ment is at least the most perfect 

it should then surely not pass unobserved that 
there is a real correspondence between deductive 
syllogism wrich is the type of logical inference 
and pure science which is the type of methodical 
knowledge it is well known that pure science 
if logically analysed resolves itself into a series 
of categorical syllogisms of the simplest and most 
perfect form but taking the subjects of our 
comparison independently of each other we trace 
in them several points of similarity the highest 
form of science it was before remarked exhibits 
both the most complete subordination and the 
strictest consequence so it is also in the highest 
form of inference the syllogism in barbara here 
subordination is most fiiuy displayed for the terras 
fall at once into their natural order the major 
including the middle and the middle including the 
minor thus the terms observe the same grada 



with formal logic 

tion in extent and in their place in the argument 
and here also we have the most complete con 
sequentiality since the conclusion follows as a 
necessary and obvious consequence from the law 
on which since the time of aristotle the validity 
of the syllogism has been held to depend with 
out any need of alteration in its form or the check 
of any derived rule whatsoever 

again there is a close practical connection 
between the inductive syllogism and classificatory 
science they afford too their points of theo 
retical resemblance each of them recognises 
and requires complete subordination this is 
implied in the very conception of classification 
and scarcely less so in that of induction which 
depends on the arrangement of facts under a law 
this feature it has in conmion with deduction 
from which however it differs by inverting the 
natural order of consequence and arguing upward 
instead of downward again it is well known 
that an induction which shall enumerate all the 
individuals of the class is seldom possible and 
when possible always useless that we should be 
content under certam checks with a limited 
number of instances and when we are materially 
right be willing to confess ourselves formally 
wrong induction then while it does fiill justice 
to subordination is for two reasons its formal 
inversion and its material imperfection deficient 
in consequentiality and thus it exhibits just the 



 on the connection of method 

same excellency and the same defect which cha 
racterize the classificatory sciences of which it is 
the recognised organ 

lastly we observed that analysis in its higher 
form began with an unproved hypothesis and 
then by a retrogressive course it felt its way 
through doubt to certainty each step is sure in 
one sense uncertain in another the connection 
between the several propositions is clear they all 
stand firm together if a basis in fact can be found 
for that one with which the analysis concludes 
there is therefore a strict consequentiality among 
them but in this merely tentative process no 
regard is had to subordination if we are only 
assured that one link binds with another we are 
careless of the law in virtue of which it binds 
this will be brought out in the synthesis if we 
follow up our research with a formal statement 
or if this theoretically correct shape be unne 
cessary the analysis will stand valid and complete 
for practical purposes without it and what is 
true in this respect of analysis is true also of its 
instrument the hypothetical syllogism this too 
has a pratical validity without any reference to 
the bearing of laws upon facts or the gradation of 
universals and without reduction to a higher logical 
form in other words its consequentiality is valid 
though it makes no pretence to subordination 

the three principal forms of syllogism therefore 
bear their testimony to the existence of corre 



with formal logic 

spending divisions in method and show a peculiar 
fitness to be its organs similar coincidences are 
traceable in other and minor parts of the logical 
apparatus these however it is not now neces 
sary to mention they will occur naturally to the 
student of logic though they could not be 
exhibited in this work without entering on minute 
technicalities to a degree quite foreign to its 
purpose 



i 



conclusion 



we have now concluded so far as the plan of 
these pages allows our consideration of logical 
method had they been far more perfect in their 
design and more exact in their execution this 
would not have hindered that unsatisfied feeling 
that craving after fiirther truth which strengthens 
with the accession of knowledge and is one of the 
strongest though not of the most pleasant motives 
for pursuing it 

it has been well said that the quest and not 
the possession of knowledge is the entertainment 
of the mind truth indeed is the one object of 
our search but the pleasures of seeking it are 
present and real the pleasures of finding it lie in 
the future and prove too often imaginary even 
when no failure intervenes between us and our 
end the road is almost always longer and more 
difficult than we expected we think ourselves 
near the top of the mountain and as we make a 
vigorous effort to scale what seems its highest 
crag perceive that we are but just making our 



conclusion 

way over its first shoulder and that its misty 
ridges still rise before us in uncertain grandeur 
and retreat as we gaze on them 

the reader of these pages cannot be more 
painfully sensible than their writer that after all 
which has been said of method its culminating 
point is not reached that highest unity which 
would give a meaning to the whole is wanting 
granting that all knowledge which deserves the 
name of science naturally arranges itself accord 
ing to certain rules under definite ideas the 
question yet remains — how are these ideas them 
selves arranged have not they too their due 
disposition and gradation can we suppose that 
there is no standard by which we can decide their 
relative dignity and importance centres of unity 
and sources of order as they are are they in 
disorder among themselves 

it is hard to suppose that they are wanting in 
this arrangement and subordination and yet 
how can we discover it we have surrendered as 
a vain imagination that science of being of which 
the ancients loved to speak it seems that power 
ful minds were permitted by providence to rest on 
the thought of the absolute unity of knowledge 
till some parts of science were so elaborated that 
they could bear in contemplating their separate 
perfection to dispense with the thorough con 
solidation of the whole we are almost reminded 
of alexanders attempt at universal empire which 

q 



• conclusion 

as such failed but left nevertheless real and per 
manent power in the hands of his generals to be 
exercised over their fragmentary kingdoms many 
sciences we know there can be we now know 
almost with equal certainty that while the human 
mind retains its present constitution they can 
never all meet in one 

may there not however be in the absence of 
this ideal unity some one science to direct the 
rest though it does not combine them as in 
practice prudence which is not an art much less 
the union of all applies and regulates all those 
arts which tend when rightly used to our common 
wellbeing may there not be in theory also 
some great science or something above a science 
to assign our speculations their place their im 
portance their proportion their relative bearing 
and make them if not in fact at least in tendency 
a whole 

one branch of study there is which in virtue 
of its very name points to the highest of all 
subjects which yet in its application reaches to 
the most delicate thoughts and finest sympathies 
of the heart of man which tells of infinity and 
eternity and yet exhibits truths of infinite and 
eternal moment under forms which have reference 
to space and time which distinguishes between 
the permanent and the fleeting — the principle 
and the economies or dispensations which are 
founded on it which teaches the importance of 



conclusion 

all truths the supreme necessity of some to which 
a heathen paid involuntary homage when he 
gave its name to what he deemed the highest 
reach of human thought and which christians 
have delighted to honour with the title of the 
mother of sciences 

much she can teach us directly of the relative 
importance of truths much more by the temper of 
mind and frame of thought she inculcates she 
rules over knowledge if by no other right by that 
of conquest she subdued it first to protect it 
ever after 

and how far is this fair mother of sciences 
like her children do the same formal conditions 
which bind them bind her also if they do not — 
has she another method of her own her own laws 
of investigation and standards of truth and false 
dood if they do — how does the nature of the 
high and mysterious subjects with which she deals 
affect and modify their application if again she 
neither conforms to the ordinary rules of specula 
tion nor has extraordinary canons of her own 
how can the body of truth which she presents be 
fairly studied at all how can the human mind 
prone not by its perverseness and obliquity but by 
a right instinct and a deep principle of nature to 
seek for order and system find its highest occupa 
tion in resting on details which may not be com 
bined statements which may not be compared 
examples from which no principles maybe extracted
